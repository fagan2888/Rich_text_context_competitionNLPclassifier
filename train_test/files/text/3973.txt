Journal of Workplace Rights
Introduction
Precarious employment--work characterized by low pay,
job insecurity, and limited statutory rights and benefits--is
associated with a heightened risk of injury as well as a
reduced likelihood of injury reporting and compensation
(Vosko, 2006). Among the factors contributing to these out-
comes is the frequent statutory exclusion of precarious work-
ersfrombasichealthandsafetyrightsandinjury-compensation
benefits (Bernstein, Lippel, Tucker, & Vosko, 2006).
Mitigating or reversing such statutory exclusions in the face
of employer and governmental opposition is challenging.
This study of the exclusion of farm workers in the Canadian
province of Alberta from mandatory workers' compensation
coverage draws on social movement theory and uses narra-
tive analysis to consider how issue framing can be used to
improve these precarious workers' access to statutory
benefits.
Examining government rationales for the contrasting
workers' compensation exceptionalism experienced by
Alberta firefighters and farm workers suggests that inconsis-
tent political justifications may be a useful jumping-off point
for farm-worker advocates interested in increasing farm
workers'access to workers'compensation benefits. Yet addi-
tional activities will likely be necessary to overcome the
interlocking interests of farmers and conservative politicians.
Among the strategies available to farm-worker advocates are
the following: (a) leveraging common-law solutions to injury
compensation to generate a shared framing among farmers
and farm workers that mandatory workers' compensation is
beneficial, (b) utilizing the greater access of migrant farm
workers from other countries to workers' compensation
treatment as a way to reframe workers' compensation as a
right rather than a cost, (c) mounting a constitutional chal-
lenge to the farm-worker exclusion, and (d) developing a
digital mobilizing structure to create a space for farm work-
ers to share information about employers' employment prac-
tices and articulate a shared sense of grievance.
Employment Precarity, Injury, and
Statutory Benefits
Constitutionally, Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories are
responsible for regulating approximately 90% of employ-
ment relationships. Alberta's legislature has passed laws

"Fortis Et Liber" Unless You Are a
Farm Worker: Workers' Compensation
Exceptionalism in Alberta, Canada
Bob Barnetson1
Abstract
Precarious employment entails both a heightened risk of injury and a greater likelihood of exclusion from statutory injury-
compensation schemes. The contrasting cases of workers' compensation entitlements among firefighters and farm workers
in the anti-union Canadian province of Alberta provide a preliminary insight into how issue framing can be used to gain
mandatory workers' compensation coverage for workers. In addition to careful and timely critiques of legislator justifications,
farm-worker advocates may be able to (a) generate shared framings among farm workers and farmers by creating a credible
liability threat, (b) leverage preferential workers' compensation access accorded to noncitizens into policy change, (c)
challenge the constitutionality of the exclusion, and (d) trigger a framing process among farm workers via social media to
increase pressure on legislators. These strategies offer a way to undermine the interlocking interests of farmers, politicians,
and agribusiness that constrain efforts to achieve broad statutory inclusion of farm workers and achieve greater access to
workers' compensation benefits for them.

establishing its own minimum terms and conditions of
employment, an occupational health and safety inspectorate,
and a state-run workers' compensation system. Alberta's
employment laws are frequently said to favor employers in
their content (Block, Roberts, & Clarke, 2003) and (non)
application (Barnetson, forthcoming). As a result of this
arrangement, and controlling for demographic and industrial
differences, Alberta workers are more likely to be injured on
the job than those in any other province except British
Columbia (Morassaei et al., 2013).
Throughout Canada, there has been a widespread shift
since the 1980s toward employment conditions that are often
characterized as precarious. Vosko (2006) defines precarious
employment as "paid work characterized by limited social
benefits and statutory entitlements, job insecurity, low wages
and high risks of ill health" (p. 4). Precarious employment
stands in contrast to the standard employment relationship
(SER), which was the normal (although by no means univer-
sal) form of employment during the middle to late 20th cen-
tury and upon which public policy continues to be based.
Some authors assert that growth in employment precarity is
a function of economic globalization, which has intensified
the commodification of labor and diminished collective
institutions (e.g., public education, the SER, trade unions,
statutory employment rights and benefits) that provided
labor security (Broad & Hunter, 2010; Standing, 2011).
Gender (Vosko & Clark, 2009) and race (Vosko, 2010) are
important factors in the distribution of precarity.
Precarious employment is associated with negative health
effects, including a greater risk of work-related injury or ill-
ness and a lower propensity to report such injuries (Lewchuk,
Clarke, & de Wolff, 2011; Lewchuk, de Wolff, King, &
Polanyi, 2006; Probst, Barbaranellu, & Petitta, 2013; Quinlin,
1999; Quinlin & Mayhew, 1999; Quinlin, Mayhew, & Bohle,
2001). This may reflect regulatory exclusion (Bernstein
et al., 2006). Historically, uncompensated workplace injury
caused significant social instability, which, in turn, gave rise
to systems of workers' compensation (Babcock, 2006;
Kostal, 1988; Risk, 1983; Witt, 2004). The exclusion of pre-
carious workers from such systems, via regulatory exclusion
and employer efforts to transfer risk to workers via subcon-
tracting arrangements (Lippel, 2006), shifts injury costs from
employers to workers, to their communities, and, in Canada
(where health care is publicly funded), to the taxpayer.
While policymakers and analysts grapple with the impli-
cations of growing precarity, precarious workers and their
advocates seek ways to mitigate or reverse these effects. The
case of Alberta farm workers is instructive regarding efforts
to reduce the statutory exclusions often associated with
employment precarity. Depending upon the Statistics Canada
data source used, Alberta has either 15,000 (Alberta, 2013b)
or 37,852 (Alberta, 2013a) part- or full-year-waged farm
workers (there appears to be no way to reconcile these num-
bers). In addition to low wages and limited job security,
Alberta's waged farm workers are excluded from virtually all
statutory employment rights, including occupational health
and safety (OHS) and mandatory workers' compensation
(Barnetson, 2009). Both employers and legislators have
resisted efforts to extend basic health and safety rights
(Barnetson, 2012a). A closer examination of farm workers'
exclusion from mandatory workers' compensation coverage
provides insight into key issues and dimensions blocking
efforts to extend statutory benefits to precarious workers. An
important part of this examination lies in contrasting the
workers'compensation experience of precariously employed
farm workers with the experience of firefighters employed in
SERs.
Complicating this analysis is segmentation within the
farm-worker group: In addition to farm workers who are
long-time Alberta residents, there is a small group of interna-
tional migrant workers. Alberta has a long history of relying
on small numbers of interprovincial migrant workers
(Danysk, 1995; Laliberte, 2006). The federal government
currently facilitates the use of approximately 3,000 interna-
tional migrant workers, mostly from Mexico and the
Caribbean (Canada, 2013). There are reports of exploitation
among contemporary migrant workers that is facilitated by
international migrants' tenuous residency. For example, the
United Food and Commercial Workers reported that an
employer had hired all of the men from a single village in a
Latin American country and, when one of them balked at
unsafe work, the employer threatened to deport the entire
crew (Yeager, 2014). While there is no clear evidence of rac-
ism in the discussion about the statutory exclusion of farm
workers, Foster and Barnetson (2013) note that Alberta gov-
ernment legislators often praise migrant work while being
cool to or critical of migrant workers. Questioning the com-
petence and commitment of international migrant workers
may be an effort to politically justify the structural and
racialized marginalization of international migrant workers
by ascribing the marginalization to characteristics and behav-
iors of international migrant workers themselves.
Workers' Compensation and
Occupational Disease
Every Canadian province operates a workers' compensation
system. Workers who are within the ambit of coverage and
who experience a compensable occupational injury are
(usually) eligible to receive a combination of wage-loss,
vocational rehabilitation, and medical care benefits.
Workers' compensation operates as a "no fault" system.
Under this arrangement, workers are entitled to receive
immediate (albeit scheduled and capped) benefits without
needing to prove any breach of the standard of care under
tort law. In exchange, workers have surrendered their right
to pursue private litigation, including claims for aggra-
vated and punitive damages (Barnetson, 2010).
Approximately 80% of Canadian workers are covered by
workers' compensation, with significant gaps in coverage
Barnetson 3
evident among workers in non-SERs and self-employed
workers (Arthurs, 2012; Bernstein, Lippel, & Lamarche,
2001; Gunderson & Hyatt, 2000). Legislation compels cer-
tain categories of employers to carry workers' compensa-
tion coverage for their employees, while other categories
of employers--such as farmers in Alberta, Saskatchewan,
Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island and 17 U.S. juris-
dictions--may purchase voluntary coverage (Barnetson,
2009). There is greater variation among U.S. workers'
compensation systems, and the remaining 37 U.S. jurisdic-
tions have some farm work coverage exceptions, typically
for farms with limited waged labor (Farmworker Justice,
2009).
Historically, most workers' compensation claims arose
from acute physical injuries clearly linked to a workplace
incident, thus determining that compensability was fairly
straightforward. By contrast, occupational diseases often
have long latency periods and murky causation (Elinson,
1995; Ison, 2005). Compounding the inherent causation
challenges posed by occupational disease are employer
efforts to minimize liability by withholding information
about the injurious nature of materials and work processes
and government reluctance to take action that would expand
employer liability (Brophy, Keith, & Schieman, 2007;
Dewees, 1988; Epstein, 1998; Firth, Brophy, & Keith, 1997;
Kotelchuck, 1989; Nugent, 1989; Rennie, 2006; Storey &
Lewchuk, 2000).
That being said, governments have recognized some
occupational diseases and granted workers with such dis-
eases presumptive status. Presumptive status means that the
Workers' Compensation Board (WCB) automatically
accepts claims when workers demonstrate that they have a
specified disease unless the WCB can rebut such a presump-
tion. Some workers receive presumptive status for occupa-
tional cancers (e.g., firefighters, coal miners, and workers
exposed to asbestos), but the presumption is often condi-
tioned upon the worker having worked in a specific industry
and/or for a specific period of time. Canada-wide, accepted
workers' compensation claims for deaths due to occupa-
tional cancer increased by more than 500% between 1997
and 2010. Led by increases in Ontario, the number of
accepted claims for cancer-related death has now surpassed
claims for traumatic-injury-related deaths (Del Bianco &
Demers, 2013). Presumptive status may be the only realistic
way to ensure compensation for occupational cancer. For
example, there is broad agreement that 8% to 10% of can-
cers have an occupational link (Epstein, 1998; Proctor,
1995; Steenland, Burnett, Lalich, Ward, & Hurrell, 2003;
Takala, 2005). The need to prove (and the difficulty associ-
ated with proving) an occupational link may partially
explain why, in 2005, only 0.22% of cancer diagnoses and
0.68% of cancer deaths in Alberta resulted in successful
workers' compensation claims--the majority being pre-
sumptive-status claims (Barnetson, 2010).
Firefighters, Farm Workers, and
Occupational Cancer
There is significant evidence that full-time municipal fire-
fighters are at heightened risk of various kinds of cancer,
including melanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia,
and multiple myeloma as well as bladder, brain, colon,
esophageal, kidney, lung, prostate, stomach, and testicular
cancer (Bates, 2007; Guidotti, 2007; LeMasters et al., 2006;
Pukkala et al., 2014). This heightened risk is most likely the
result of occupational exposures to burning materials. While
most workers can refuse to work when they face imminent
danger, Section 35(2)(a) of Alberta's OHS Act defines immi-
nent danger as "a danger that is not normal for that occupa-
tion." Carcinogenic exposures are normal dangers for
firefighters, and thus firefighters have no right to refuse this
work.
All Alberta municipal firefighters fall within the ambit of
the Workers' Compensation Act. Absent presumptive status,
firefighters seeking workers'compensation for cancer would
have to demonstrate that their cancer arose from and occurred
during the course of employment. Proving cancer causation
for firefighters has been difficult. While no Alberta data are
available, British Columbia reported a 35% acceptance rate
for cancer claims between 1985 and 2004 (WorkSafeBC,
2004). Recognizing the evidence of occupational cancer
among firefighters, the Manitoba legislature granted pre-
sumptive status to certain firefighter cancers in 2002.
Beginning in 2003, Alberta, British Columbia, New
Brunswick, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Nova
Scotia, and the Yukon followed suit (Association of Workers'
Compensation Boards of Canada, 2012). Further changes in
Alberta in 2010 and 2011 saw presumptive status expand to
include 14 types of cancers, assuming the firefighter meets
minimum service requirements.
Firefighters typically have SERs, with high wages and job
security and significant access to employment and statutory
benefits. Firefighters' success in maintaining and improving
their working conditions may stem from a high rate of union-
ization (resulting in relatively high wages and job security),
firefighting's ties to the interests of capital (i.e., property pro-
tection and loss mitigation), and efforts by firefighter advo-
cates to politically capitalize upon the "honourable white
masculinity associated with firefighting" (Braedley, 2009, p.
129). Canadian firefighters sought presumptive status for a
number of years (Guidotti, 2003). Some commentators sug-
gest that the widespread adoption of presumptive status in
Canada beginning in 2002 reflects firefighter advocates'utili-
zation of their increased political capital post-9/11 to trigger
long-sought legislative change. Indeed, Alberta legislators
made specific reference to the heroism of firefighters during
9/11 in justifying presumptive coverage (Alberta, 2003a,
2003c). Interestingly, despite increases in the prevalence of
presumptive status and 9/11-specific injury-compensation
4 SAGE Open
legislation, only half theAmerican firefighters have access to
presumptive status for cancer (Gordy, 2013).
In contrast to firefighters, Alberta farm workers are arche-
typal precarious workers, with low wages and limited job
security (Alberta, 2013b; Barnetson, 2012a). Approximately
3,000 of these workers are foreign migrant workers, whose
precarious employment is compounded by their precarious
residency (Canada, 2013). Farm workers are largely excluded
from statutory employment rights, including most of the
Employment Standards Code, all of the Labour Relations
Code and the OHS Act, and mandatory workers' compensa-
tion coverage (Barnetson, 2009). The employers of approxi-
mately 7.5% of farm workers have taken out voluntary
workers' compensation coverage (WCB, 2013). Farm work-
ers with coverage seeking to make a worker's compensation
claim for occupational cancer would need to demonstrate
that the cancer arose from and occurred during the course of
employment, a task complicated by their lack of a right to
know about the hazards they are exposed to due to their
exclusion from the OHS Act.
Previous research examined the opportunity structure
faced by Alberta farm workers seeking basic statutory
employment rights (Barnetson, 2009). The opportunity struc-
ture--the degree of openness within a system to change, the
(in)stability of economic and political relationships among
powerful actors, the presence of powerful allies, and the
state's ability and willingness to repress dissent--is one of
three sets of factors typically of interest in social movement
theory (Jenkins, 1985; Jenkins & Klandermas, 1995; Jenkins
& Perrow, 1977; Kriesi, 1995; McAdam, 1996). The other
two factors are mobilizing structures (i.e., informal and for-
mal means by which individuals act collectively) and the
framing process by which groups develop shared meanings
and definitions, including a sense of cognitive liberation (i.e.,
the sense that inequitable circumstances are susceptible to
change; Buechler, 2000; McAdam, McCarthy, & Zaid, 1996).
This earlier research found that the statutory exclusion of
Alberta farm workers is one outcome of the interlocking eco-
nomic and political interests of the state, agribusiness, and
farmers, and that there was little evidence that farm workers
had much opportunity to advance an agenda of statutory
inclusion. This study seeks to extend that research by nar-
rowing the focus to a specific exclusion (mandatory workers'
compensation) and examining the framing process.
Specifically, it considers how legislators (key actors as set
out in the earlier research) frame the exceptional nature of
the farm-worker exclusion and how farm workers do (and
may) resist and influence that framing.
While social movement theory typically discusses the
development of a shared framing of an issue among workers
(Buechler, 2000; McAdam et al., 1996), farm workers' lim-
ited ability to develop mobilizing structures due to the frag-
mented nature of the industry and their inability to unionize
suggest that alternative approaches to developing a shared
framing and mobilizing structures may be necessary. For
example, developing a shared framing between employers
and precarious workers may be a useful approach.
It is important to recognize that social movement theory is
often criticized as overly structuralist and insufficiently cog-
nizant of the agency of actors and the implicit or explicit
strategic choices they make (Jasper, 2004). The manner in
which workers and worker advocates engage in framing
debates will be influenced by various dilemmas (e.g., with
regard to organizational form, engagement, naughty vs. nice,
plan vs. opportunity) that are common to social movements.
Considering how (and why) workers and their advocates
have approached these dilemmas begins to link a structural
analysis of framing to social action and will form part of this
study's analysis.
The study begins by considering how the workers' com-
pensation access of firefighters (exceptionally good) con-
trasts with the workers'compensation access of farm workers
(exceptionally bad). This comparative approach is warranted
because farm workers share three important similarities to
firefighters around occupational disease. First, farm workers
face a heightened risk of various kinds of cancers, including
melanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, and multi-
ple myeloma as well as brain, cervical, esophageal, oral,
prostate, and stomach cancers (Blair & Freeman, 2009; Blair
& Zahm, 1995; Fincham, Hanson, & Berkel, 1992; Mills,
Dodge, & Yang, 2009). Second, this heightened risk is likely
the result of occupational exposures to pesticides, solvents,
exhausts, dusts, and microbes. Third, farm workers have no
ability to refuse occupational exposures to carcinogens due
to their exclusion from the OHS Code. Understanding how
Alberta legislators have justified such differential exception-
alism around injury compensation identifies key consider-
ations around the framing process for advocates seeking to
increase access to statutory rights for precarious workers. It
also suggests potentially fruitful ways for workers and their
advocates to reframe the issue.
Method
Although this case study focuses exclusively on Alberta, it
will be of interest to readers in both Canada and the United
States. Along with Alberta, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward
Island, and Saskatchewan continue to normally exclude
farming and ranching from mandatory workers' compensa-
tion coverage. The strategies available to Alberta farm work-
ers and their advocates may have utility in these other
provinces. The long-standing social and fiscal conservativ-
ism of Alberta's government has given rise to a labor rela-
tions climate similar to that experienced by many American
readers. For example, Alberta's private-sector unionization
rate is approximately 12% (Canada, 2012), and there are sig-
nificant numbers of international migrant workers--both in
agriculture and in the service industry (Canada, 2013). These
parallels suggest that strategies identified in this article may
have application in the United States.
Barnetson 5
Alberta is governed in the Westminster parliamentary tra-
dition--the party that elects the most legislators forms the
government. The right-wing Progressive Conservative party
has formed the government since 1971. This study uses nar-
rative analysis to examine how government (i.e., Progressive
Conservative or "Tory") members of the legislative assem-
bly (MLAs) in Alberta explain the differential access to
workers' compensation benefits faced by farm workers and
municipal firefighters. MLAs' statements were selected for
analysis because they can indicate the outcomes and norms
desired by powerful actors and provide insight into how poli-
ticians justify such outcomes to maintain legitimacy with the
electorate (Sharma, 2006). The study of such public rituals
can be useful in understanding the underlying political econ-
omy of an issue as well as identifying specific framing and
reframing efforts.
Narrative analysis identifies how MLAs order and relay
information about workers' compensation coverage and
thereby communicate (or construct) a particular meaning for
the audience (Bryman, Bell, Mills, & Yue, 2011; Prasad,
2005). Because narratives are constructed, narrative analysis
allows us to examine both the story itself and how the story
serves the interests of the teller while preserving the teller's
context (Smith, 2000). The intentionality of narrative con-
struction means that the teller, the audience, and the context
all become important components of the analysis
(Czarniawska-Joerges, 2004). Given the nature of the data,
this study conducts a thematic form of narrative analysis to
assess how MLAs justify differential access to compensation
benefits, which emphasizes the content of the story and how
it serves specific interests (Riessman, 2008).
The data for this study comprise all the statements
recorded in transcripts of the proceedings of the Legislative
Assembly of Alberta (Hansard) by government MLAs about
workers' compensation for farm workers and firefighters
between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2011. The data-
set excludes government policy documents. Examples of
these documents were reviewed and not found to articulate a
policy rationale suitable for analysis. This study also excludes
statements by MLAs recorded in print media. A review of
such statements revealed that they added little new content.
Data collection began with keyword searches (injur*,
worker*, compensation, firefighter*, farm*) of Hansard
transcripts' indices from 2000 to 2011 (inclusive). The year
2000 was selected as a starting date due to the significant
increase in provincial attention to workplace injury (includ-
ing farm injuries) that occurred at that time (Barnetson,
2012a, 2013a). A review of previous legislative transcripts
(1995-1999) yielded no relevant passages. Data collection
was truncated in 2011 because the 2012 and 2013 passages
added little to the analysis. A review of the 373 potentially
relevant passages narrowed the dataset down to 103 pas-
sages. The relevant passages were analyzed in the context of
the statement in which they appeared to ensure that the quo-
tation could be understood within its context.
A thematic narrative analysis was then conducted in three
stages. First, an initial reading of all the statements brought
to the surface six main reasons for firefighter exceptionalism
and three main reasons for farm-worker exceptionalism. The
dataset for farm-worker exceptionalism was thin (10 pas-
sages) but closely mirrored a much larger dataset regarding
farm-worker exclusions from the ambit of Alberta's OHS Act
(Barnetson, 2012a). Second, each reason for exceptionalism
was further analyzed to tease out its details in greater depth.
Third, the analytic focus moved to the context in which each
set of justifications was constructed, to draw out additional
insights about the justifications and identify key issues and
dimensions relevant to mitigating or reversing the statutory
exclusion of farm workers.
Justifying Firefighter and Farm-Worker
Exceptionalism
MLAs used six reasons to justify presumptive status for fire-
fighter cancers during the 2003 legislative debates. These
arguments were reprised verbatim when presumptive cover-
age was expanded to other cancers as well as to part-time and
volunteer firefighters in 2010 and 2011. The consistency of
the narratives used each time was striking, and exemplars set
out below have been selected from the 2003, 2010, and 2011
debates.
The first reason government MLAs gave for granting fire-
fighters presumptive status was that firefighters get cancer
more often than the average person, most likely caused by
occupational exposures to carcinogens. For example, the
sponsor of the 2003 bill (MLA Richard Magnus) made the
following statement:
Studies from Burnett, Guidotti, Mount Sinai, and the Ontario
industrial disease panel, to name a few, all have told the same
story: The profession of fire fighting makes firefighters more
likely to get these cancers than you and I. Why? Because every
time that a firefighter walks into a fire . . . he steps into a toxic
soup of soot and gases that are released by the burning materials.
(Alberta, 2003a, p. 219)
MLAs' second reason for enacting presumptive coverage
was that firefighters are the only workers who cannot refuse
exposures to occupational carcinogens:
[T]here's a huge difference between firefighters and other
professions. If in any other profession workers encounter a
dangerous situation, an environmental risk, they can refuse to
work under that danger . . . but firefighters cannot. When an oil
refinery explodes or a chemical factory catches fire, firefighters
are duty bound to enter that environment and work in it. (Mr.
Magnus, as cited in Alberta, 2003a, p. 220)
The third reason given for presumptive coverage was the
difficulty individual firefighters have in demonstrating the
clear link between a specific exposure (or specific exposures)
6 SAGE Open
and their cancer that is necessary to gain workers'compensa-
tion benefits:
The fundamental problem from an evidentiary point of view is
that many cancers arise from many, many different types of
causes. . . . It's very difficult, if not impossible, for us to know
exactly what the causes of those cancers were and when they
might have arisen. The result has been that it's been extremely
difficult for our firefighters to muster the evidence necessary to
show that there is a nexus between the various types of cancer
and the exposure to toxic compounds that they encounter in the
course of their employment, sometimes years and years before a
cancer arises. (Dr. Brown, as cited in Alberta, 2010c, p. 580)
Placing such an evidentiary burden on firefighters and
their families was deemed to be unfair:
Without this legislation Alberta firefighters . . . would have to
file a workers' compensation claim and endure the uncertainties
of the claims process. This process of claims and appeals can
take years to produce a final decision, and even then there is no
guarantee that the claims system will recognize their illness as
occupational and award appropriate compensation. [Presumptive
status] would allow these families to focus all of their attention
and energy on fighting these diseases rather than on the claims
and appeals process of workers' compensation. (Mr. Johnston,
as cited in Alberta, 2010a, p. 218)
MLAs' fourth reason for granting firefighters presump-
tive status was that the cost of presumptive status was
expected to be small:
Another concern is that all of a sudden there will be an outpouring
of claims for WCB benefits. Let's face it. No one wants to have
cancer. Cancer claims aren't going to appear mysteriously out of
nowhere if Bill 202 is passed. Current statistics bear this out.
Each year 1.8 of every 1,000 firefighters are diagnosed with
cancer. In Alberta there are roughly 2,300 firefighters. Using
simple math, then, it can reasonably be assumed that four cancer
cases involving firefighters would be brought to the WCB's
attention in Alberta each year. (Mr. Cenaiko, as cited in Alberta,
2003a, p. 228)
The fifth reason MLAs cited for granting presumptive sta-
tus was that other jurisdictions had adopted similar presump-
tive-status provisions around firefighter cancer:
This has already been accomplished in one other Canadian
province and 23 states of the United States. . . . Manitoba set the
standard for other provinces to follow by passing Bill 5, the
Workers Compensation Act, on May 2, 2002. . . . The road to
introducing Bill 5 in Manitoba was one that involved tragic
events. Since 1987 17 firefighters have died in Winnipeg from
work-related cancers. That is 17 lives lost and 17 families
shattered. (Mrs. Fritz, as cited in Alberta, 2003a, p. 223)
Finally, MLAs described firefighters as heroes and indi-
cated that society owed them presumptive status:
There's another reason to support this bill, a more emotional,
less tangible reason, and that is that firefighters deserve it. They
deserve to know that just as they are there for us whenever we
encounter danger and just as they answer any call for help, they
can count upon us as legislators and Albertans to back them up
in their rare times of need. Firefighters haven't come before the
Legislature before, making demands or asking for help. That
would be out of character for them, but this matters to them
deeply. It matters that we send a signal that we understand the
risks they take, the dangers they face, and the duty they accept,
a duty that few of us would ever consider. (Mr. Magnus, as cited
in Alberta, 2003a, p. 220)
A variation in this theme was that society owed firefight-
ers' families presumptive status:
The service of the men and women who bravely enter burning
buildings, gladly risking their lives for ours, is quite obvious.
More subtle is the service rendered to the people of Alberta by
the families of these firefighters. Each day, like the firefighters
themselves, they deal with a great amount of uncertainty. Mr.
Speaker, they're also the ones who will take care of our
firefighters if they have to battle cancer and are the ones left
behind if they lose that fight. (Mr. Johnston, as cited in Alberta,
2010a, p. 219)
In contrast to the prominence of firefighters in the argu-
ments for granting them exceptional access to compensation,
farm workers are entirely absent from discussion about
maintaining the farm-worker exclusion from workers' com-
pensation. Instead, MLAs discuss employer interests, a sub-
ject that never came up when they were discussing
presumptive status for firefighters--perhaps because fire-
fighter employers were supportive of presumptive status
(Alberta, 2011b). When the farm-worker exclusion was
questioned, MLAs argued three things. First, MLAs said that
educating farmers about the benefits of taking out voluntary
workers' compensation for their workers was better than
forcing them to do so:
Mr. Speaker, when we do some of the work and talk with the
farm families, there are many of them who are aware that they
can get coverage under WCB, and a lot of individuals opt to take
the optional WCB coverage. So there is some protection that's
available for farm workers if the employers and employees
make that arrangement between themselves. On that basis, we
don't anticipate any immediate changes. We still believe in
education and some of the work that . . . [cut off by time limit].
(Mr. Goudreau, as cited in Alberta, 2008, p. 1945)
Second, MLAs argued that farms cannot be regulated like
so-called regular worksites, primarily because farms are
mixed-use worksites (i.e., they are both homes and
businesses):
Well, Mr. Speaker, work environment on a farm obviously
differs a great deal from that in any industrial setting. A farm is
also a place where people actually live and raise children, and
Barnetson 7
it's a community, so applying strict industrial standards to a farm
setting is not exactly comparable. (Mr. Lukaszuk, as cited in
Alberta, 2010b, p. 1109)
Finally, some MLAs said that farmers do not want manda-
tory workers' compensation coverage forced upon them:
Well, Mr. Speaker, it's not about [the government] finding
money. It's about the producers' desire. I know that if the
producers, in their wisdom not ours, were to come forward in a
majority view to the minister of agriculture, he would bring that
forward to this table. He represents them extraordinarily well.
But I must inform the hon. member, being a part of the
agricultural community myself, that they are very independent
thinkers, and they like to make their decisions and ask us to
carry out policy they believe is in their best interest. (Mrs.
McClellan, as cited in Alberta, 2006, p. 1672)
I had it reinforced for me again this morning in a meeting that I
had in Trochu, Alberta, with a group of 25 agricultural producers
when I asked them right flat out how we could help them and
they said: no more regulations. I said: Are we moving in the
right direction with our farm safety instead of workmen's
compensation and occupational health and safety? They said:
Absolutely; this is what we want. (Mr. Hayden, as cited in
Alberta, 2011a, p. 358)
It is useful to assess the validity of these rationales for
exceptionalism. This analysis suggests that contrasting forms
of workers' compensation exceptionalism mask very similar
working conditions for firefighters and farm workers and are
frequently based on specious arguments.
Discussion
The rationales used to justify granting firefighters presump-
tive coverage for some cancers sit uneasily with MLAs'
efforts to maintain the farm-worker exclusion. While it is
true that firefighters get cancer more often than the average
person, research suggests that farm workers also face a
heightened rate of cancer. MLAs' efforts to distinguish fire-
fighters from other workers by saying that firefighters are the
only workers who cannot refuse exposures to occupational
carcinogens ignore the fact that farm workers are also unable
to refuse unsafe exposures, because they are excluded from
the ambit of the OHS Code.
The difficulty firefighters faced in demonstrating a clear
link between a specific exposure (or specific exposures) and
their cancer is consistent with the causation challenges typi-
cal of occupational diseases. Farm workers face similar dif-
ficulties because their exclusion from the OHS Code means
their employers have no obligation to inform them about the
hazards in their workplace, including carcinogenic expo-
sures. While MLAs did offer to consider extending presump-
tive status to other occupational groups with valid claims
(Alberta, 2003b, 2003c), farm workers' exclusion from the
Labour Relations Code effectively precludes such a claim
due to farm workers' limited individual ability to formulate
and advance such claims to government.
MLAs noted that the cost of presumptive status was
expected to be small. The cost of mandatory workers' com-
pensation coverage would be approximately 3% of payroll.
Absent mandatory coverage, farm workers' employers are
able to externalize injury costs onto farm workers, their fam-
ilies, and the taxpayer-funded medical system. Justifying
presumptive status for firefighters by pointing to similar
efforts in other jurisdictions ignores the fact that farm work-
ers have slowly been acquiring basic employment rights in
other Canadian jurisdictions, a trend that accelerated during
the time period during which firefighter presumptive status
spread across Canada (Barnetson, 2012a; Faraday, Fudge, &
Tucker, 2012). Finally, MLAs described firefighters as
heroes and indicated that society owed firefighters presump-
tive status. By contrast, farm workers are entirely absent
from legislative debates about extending mandatory work-
ers' compensation coverage.
The rationales used to justify maintaining the farm-worker
exclusion from workers' compensation are clearly defective.
MLAs' assertion that educating farmers about the benefits of
taking out voluntary workers' compensation for their work-
ers was better than forcing farmers to take out coverage can-
not be reconciled with the fact that education has resulted in
approximately 93% of farm workers having no coverage.
MLAs' insistence that farms cannot be regulated like so-
called regular worksites because they are both homes and
businesses ignores the fact that nine other jurisdictions in
Canada require mandatory coverage (although farms oper-
ated with only family labor are sometimes excluded). And
MLAs' belief that farmers do not want mandatory workers'
compensation coverage forced upon them ignores the fact
that employer resistance to regulation is generally not con-
sidered a valid basis upon which to make public policy.
Furthermore, the underlying issue is that government MLAs
are politically beholden to rural voters for reelection due to
MLAs' gerrymandering of electoral boundaries, and, conse-
quently, MLAs are reluctant to eliminate the statutory excep-
tionalism that farmers value (Barnetson, 2009).
This analysis yields three useful, although admittedly
pedestrian, observations for worker advocates. First, excep-
tionalism in public policy requires justification. The justifi-
cation provided does not necessarily have to be particularly
good (or even true). But politicians clearly recognize the
need for at least the façade of a rationale so as to maintain
their legitimacy when making public policy. This, in turn,
suggests that politicians may be sensitive (or even vulnera-
ble) to having their purported rationale upended by careful
and timely analysis. Second, employer support or opposition
can play a critical role in extending access to statutory ben-
efits. Employer opposition is not immutable and is suscepti-
ble to being politically neutralized or even converted into
support. Furthermore, employer opposition is not determina-
tive: Workers with powerful allies or whose dissent the state
8 SAGE Open
would be unable or unwilling to repress can achieve public
policy change. These lessons are applied below to suggest
some potential opportunities for change.
Conclusion
The analysis above suggests four potential strategies for
advancing mandatory workers' compensation coverage for
Alberta farm workers. These strategies can be pursued indi-
vidually but are also mutually reinforcing, in that each
addresses one of the three key dimensions suggested by
social movement theory (political opportunities, mobilizing
structures, and framing processes). The strategic choices and
dilemmas posed by each strategy are also considered.
The longevity of workers' compensation systems can be
partly attributed to how well the systems meet the respective
needs of workers, employers, and the state. Workers receive
immediate, stable, and predictable compensation. Employers
benefit from liability protection and the collectivizing of the
cost of injury.And the state can manage disputes about injury
compensation by channeling them into an energy-intensive
process run by an arms-length organization (Barnetson,
2010). Alberta's farm-worker exclusion means that employ-
ers can be sued by their workers. The potential awards from
a civil suit--which may include aggravated and punitive
damages--can be significant. Consider the recent USD$765
million settlement agreed to by the National Football League
over head injuries to some 4,500 players (Connor, 2013). A
similar CAD$38 million lawsuit filed by National Hockey
League Player Steve Moore against Todd Bertuzzi and the
Vancouver Canucks, following a 2004 hit that ended Moore's
career, was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum
(Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 2014). While sports
stars have financial resources far beyond those of most farm
workers, the potential for individual or class-action suits
resulting in large awards is not lost on Alberta farmers.
Indeed, a recent lawsuit brought by the widow of farm
worker Kevan Chandler resulted in an out-of-court settle-
ment and the subsequent bankruptcy of the employer
(Barnetson, 2012b).
The specter of crippling awards for farm injuries has
heightened interest within some employer groups in the lia-
bility protection offered by workers'compensation coverage.
Indeed, some members of Alberta's largest farm lobby group
passed a motion compelling their organization to explore
mandatory workers' compensation coverage (Barnetson,
2013c). So far, this has created significant discord within this
producers' group, which has reduced the group's ability to
publicly resist calls for mandatory workers' compensation--
although the group's executive continues to do so behind the
scenes (Barnetson, 2013b).
Lawsuits over both injuries and fatalities provide a means
(albeit imperfect) to provide injury compensation to workers
and to increase the levels of voluntary coverage among
employers, both of which are positive outcomes. As levels of
voluntary coverage grow, employer resistance to the cost of
coverage will decrease and the desire to take the cost of cov-
erage out of competition (via mandatory coverage) will
grow. In addition to creating periodic political opportunities
for change, civil suits also create the possibility for employ-
ers and farm workers to develop a shared framing of manda-
tory coverage as a mutually beneficial outcome. The key
impediments to this strategy for farm-worker activists are the
cost of litigation, the delays involved in it, and the willing-
ness of workers (or their families) to engage in it. The bene-
fits include the humanizing of farm workers, demonstrating
their vulnerability to injuries, and highlighting the indecency
of employers who externalize costs onto workers in the form
of injury.
Over the past 20 years, Alberta farmers have begun
employing increasing numbers of international migrant
workers. In 2012, more than 3,000 international migrants
were employed through various government-sponsored for-
eign-workerprograms(EmploymentandSocialDevelopment
Canada, 2014). Employers must provide each of these
migrant workers with workers' compensation coverage,
either from a provincial WCB or from a private insurer
(Employment and Social Development Canada, 2013). As a
result, international migrant workers have better statutory
access to workers' compensation (via federal requirements)
than do farm workers who hold Canadian citizenship.Alberta
has experienced a rapid increase in the use of temporary
migrant workers since the year 2000 (Foster, 2012). This
growth has caused significant political problems for Alberta
politicians around the specter of migrant workers displacing
Canadians and eroding wages and working conditions
(Foster & Barnetson, 2013). Highlighting the preferential
access that international migrant workers are granted to
workers' compensation provides a potent rhetorical lever for
those advocating mandatory access for Canadian farm
workers.
This lever is potent in two ways. First, it plays on an exist-
ing fear among Canadian workers that international workers
will replace them, by providing evidence that international
workers receive better treatment than Canadian workers (at
least in this one respect). That Alberta's government pro-
vides Canadian farm workers with poorer access to injury
compensation than the federal government mandates for for-
eign nationals is potentially damaging for provincial politi-
cians, particularly in light of growing grassroots resistance to
foreign migrant workers. Second, there is no real rationale
for excluding farm workers from mandatory coverage,
except the perceived need to politically pander to their
employers. Indeed, other workers who face similarly hazard-
ous working conditions (such as firefighters) receive excep-
tional access to workers'compensation rather than exclusion.
The potential effectiveness of this strategy will be height-
ened if it is pursued in combination with a litigation strategy
to reduce employer resistance to mandatory coverage. A
potential risk associated with this approach is that it may
Barnetson 9
prove divisive among potential progressive allies, who are
sympathetic to the position of migrant workers.
A third strategy is to launch a constitutional challenge to
Alberta's statutory exclusion of farm workers from basic
employment rights. Alberta's exclusion of farm workers
from mandatory workers' compensation coverage may vio-
late Sections 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms. Section 15(1) of the Charter stipulates,
Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the
right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without
discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based
on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or
mental or physical disability.
Medeiros and McIntyre (2014) suggest that the farm-
worker exclusion may discriminate on the basis of occupa-
tional status and disability. While occupational status is not
an enumerated ground of discrimination, the jurisprudence
suggests that it may be an analogous ground. The concurring
reasons in Dunmore v Ontario (Attorney General) (2001)
and Ontario (Attorney General) v Fraser (2011) provided
differing views as to whether occupational status as an agri-
cultural worker is a protected ground; thus, the facts of any
challenge will be an important factor in the outcome of a
challenge. The disability argument is that two of the diseases
(silo filler's disease and farmer's lung) for which presump-
tive status is granted are likely to be caused by exposures
unique to farm workers; excluding farm workers from work-
ers' compensation coverage indirectly discriminates against
agricultural workers who develop these diseases. These
forms of discrimination create a disadvantage by precluding
farm workers from accessing the medical and vocational
rehabilitation services they would otherwise be entitled to
under workers' compensation. Instead, these farm workers
must rely upon probably slower and poorer publicly pro-
vided medical services.
Section 7 of the Charter stipulates that
Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person
and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance
with the principles of fundamental justice.
Excluding farm workers from the ambit of workers' com-
pensation means that these workers must access medical ser-
vices through the public health care system, which entails
long waiting times. By contrast, workers within the workers'
compensation system have expedited access to diagnostic and
treatment services due, for which the WCB pays directly. The
reduced speed and quality of health services caused by the
farm-worker exclusion may cause detrimental physical and
psychological effects, which constitute a violation of farm
workers' security of person (Medeiros & McIntyre, 2014).
Such a challenge would need to engage with the question of
whether the resulting deprivation is arbitrary, over-broad, and
grossly disproportional. Both the Section 7 challenge and the
Section 15 challenge would also need to withstand a likely
government argument that these violations can be reasonably
justified in a free and democratic society (Section 1). The
key impediment to this strategy is mostly one of cost and
delay, but the prospect of a court victory by farm workers
may pressurize the government to preemptively amend its
legislation.
The final strategy is one of social mobilization via social
media (specifically Facebook). Traditionally, it has been dif-
ficult to organize or even disseminate information to farm
workers because of their physical isolation and fear of being
ostracized (Danysk, 1995). The ubiquity of mobile devices,
the penetration of social media, and the anonymity of the
Internet dramatically reduce the issues of distance and the
risks of information sharing and organizing. Anonymously
sharing employment experiences serves a dual purpose. In
the short term, it provides prospective workers with informa-
tion about potential employers. This creates a form of market
pressure on employers to provide desirable working condi-
tions, although such pressure may be diminished by a loose
labor market and may be less meaningful for migrant work-
ers (who have no labor mobility). In the longer term, it gives
farm workers an opportunity to develop a sense of shared
grievance (i.e., it creates a framing process).
In contrast to efforts in the Canadian province of Ontario
(Faraday et al., 2012), organized labor in Alberta has largely
abandoned efforts to assist farm workers to acquire statutory
rights, with only the United Food and Commercial Workers
carrying forward an extended, albeit modest, campaign. In
place of organized labor, a grassroots organization called the
Farmworkers Union of Alberta (FU Alberta) has emerged
over the past 10 years. FU Alberta has few organizational
resources; it has only two staff members, both of whom are
volunteers. One of the difficulties FU Alberta has faced is a
belief among other stakeholders that it does not represent a
constituency. The exclusion of farm workers from the ambit
of the Labour Relations Code effectively precludes FU
Alberta from representing farm workers in collective bar-
gaining. This statutory inability to bargain dramatically
reduces the incentive of farm workers to join FU Alberta,
resulting in few members and questions about whom (if any-
one) FU Alberta represents. This lack of organizational
capacity has been used by organized labor as a pretext for
limiting its support of FU Alberta. And the lack of a constitu-
ency limits the policy salience of FU Alberta when it is inter-
acting with provincial politicians.
A vibrant Facebook group creates a mobilizing structure
that FU Alberta may eventually be able to parlay into more
concrete action (e.g., demonstrations, letter-writing cam-
paigns). This process has proven effective in the grassroots
mobilization of opponents of Canada's temporary foreign-
worker program. It also calls attention to working conditions
on farms, conditions that are often exploitative and simply
odious: numerous injuries, many of them gruesome, poor sani-
tation, appalling working and living conditions, low wages
10 SAGE Open
and poor treatment, harassment, and sexual assault (Dunlop
& Kosta, 2008). These characteristics of farm work can be
harnessed to improve the public perception of farm workers
as necessary and hardworking, and as needing and deserving
of the same basic employment rights as every other worker.
The key difficulties for farm-worker advocates center on the
effort involved in sustaining such a community and the
potential development of rival agendas.
Overall, this analysis of framing opportunities around
mandatory workers' compensation coverage for farm work-
ers suggests that, while there is presently little political
opportunity for broad statutory inclusion of farm workers in
Alberta (Barnetson, 2009), reframing sub-issues (as well as
creating mobilizing structures) may change the context and
thus the option set available for farm-worker advocates.
Considering the current environment, strategies such as
increasing employer interest in voluntary coverage via a
credible litigation threat, revealing inconsistencies in work
treatment, challenging the constitutionality of the exclusion,
and developing space for farm workers to share stories and
engage in a framing debate provide viable options for
advocates.
