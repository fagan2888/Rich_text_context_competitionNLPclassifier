Infective endocarditis is a potentially fatal consequence of
illicit injection drug use. We estimate that the number of
hospitalization for injection drug use­related infective en-
docarditis increased by 38%­66% in the United States be-
tween 2000­2001 and 2002­2003, a period during which the
number of at-risk persons (i.e., injection drug users) re-
mained stable. Increasing methamphetamine use and/or
drug injection frequency may have increased the incidence
of infective endocarditis among active injection drug users.
Infective endocarditis (IE) is a potentially fatal consequence of
injecting illicit drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, and metham-
phetamine [1]. Injection drug use (IDU) can increase IE risk
through a variety of mechanisms. Drug solutions may contain
particulate matter (e.g., talc) that damage cardiac valves if in-
jected intravenously [1]. In addition, poor injection hygiene
(e.g., lack of skin cleaning before injecting), injecting with un-
sterile equipment, and injecting contaminated drug solutions
can introduce high circulating bacterial loads [1]. Finally, the
physiologic effects of specific drugs may increase IE risk. For
example, the prevalence of IE is high among persons who inject
cocaine, and researchers and clinicians have partially attributed
this elevated prevalence to the vasospasm and cardiac tissue
damage that cocaine induces [1]. We report on a nationwide
increase in the number of hospitalizations for IDU-related IE

during the period 2000­2003 in the United States and propose
possible causes of this trend that merit investigation.
Methods. We identified cases of IDU-related IE that oc-
curred from 1996 through 2003 in the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention National Hospital Discharge Survey
database (NHDS) [2]. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention designed NHDS to produce nationally representa-
tive annual data on hospitalizations in non-Federal, short-term
care facilities with 6 beds [3]. Annually, NHDS captures
270,000 inpatient stays in 500 hospitals located in the 50 states
and Washington, DC [3]. For each case, NHDS records patient
sociodemographic characteristics, medical data (including up
to 7 diagnoses and 4 procedures, coded using the International
Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
system), and administrative items [3].
The International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification system does not specify whether cases of
IE are IDU related. Drawing on past efforts to identify cases
of IDU-related IE in hospitalization data [4], we developed 2
algorithms to identify cases of interest in NHDS, using data
on patient diagnoses, procedures, and sociodemographic char-
acteristics; we designed one algorithm to be specific and the
other to be sensitive. The specific algorithm classified cases in
the database as IDU-related IE if the individual met each of
the following criteria: (1) the patient received a diagnosis of
bacterial endocarditis or endocarditis that was not otherwise
specified; (2) the patient's medical record included a diagnosis
or procedure indicating the use of a commonly injected illicit
drug (e.g., cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine); diagnoses
included opioid-, cocaine-, and amphetamine-related depen-
dence, use, poisoning, or accidental death; and procedures in-
cluded drug addiction counseling, detoxification, and rehabil-
itation; (3) the patient was 16­64 years of age when hospitalized
(an age category that captures the majority of IDUs and ex-
cludes seniors, a group that is particularly susceptible to bac-
terial infections irrespective of injection status [5]); and (4) the
patient had no documented conditions or procedures per-
formed that predispose to IE (e.g., prosthetic valve or device,
rheumatic or congenital heart disease, cardiac cathetherization,
or dialysis).
Notably, this algorithm will misclassify cases of IDU-related
IE as noncases in instances in which patients conceal their drug
use from hospital staff. Therefore, we constructed a second,
more sensitive algorithm to capture these hidden users; as with
all sensitive measures, this algorithm will capture more cases
than the specific algorithm at the expense of misclassifyingsome

NOTE. Data are weighted using NHDS survey weights to create national estimates. Period 1 was from
1996 through 1997, period 2 was from 1998 through 1999, period 3 was from 2000 through 2001, and period
4 was from 2002 through 2003.
noncases as cases. On the basis of the epidemiology of IE [6],
we designed the sensitive algorithm to capture individuals who
received diagnoses of bacterial endocarditis and met criteria 3
and 4 but did not necessarily meet criterion 2. However, pa-
tients who received a diagnosis of endocarditis that was not
otherwise specified had to meet criteria 2, 3, and 4 to be clas-
sified as having a case of IDU-related IE in the sensitive al-
gorithm. (We considered including a diagnosis of hepatitis C
virus infection in both the sensitive and the specific algorithms
as another means of identifying IDUs, because hepatitis C virus
infection is common among IDUs and is relatively rare among
non-IDUs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
hepatitis C virus testing guidelines, however, broadened sub-
stantially in 1998 [12]; therefore, we decided against this mod-
ification. Given increased testing over time, classifying hepatitis
C virus­positive individuals as IDUs would have artificially
inflated temporal trends in the number of IDU-related IE cases
detected.)
The number of cases of IDU-related IE that were identified
by each algorithm was weighted to reflect the US population,
using NHDS survey weights. We aggregated results into 2-year
periods to ease interpretation (period 1, 1996­1997; period 2,
1998­1999; period 3, 2000­2001; and period 4, 2002­2003).
The x2 test was used to identify temporal changes in the number
of IDU-related IE hospital discharges. Specifically, for every pair
of consecutive periods, we tested whether the observed number
of hospital discharges occurring during each period differed
from the expected number; the expected number for each pe-
riod was calculated as one-half of the sum of the number of
IDU-related IE hospital discharges during 2 consecutive peri-
ods. Because HIV-related immunosuppression increases IE risk
[7] and new therapies reducing HIV-related immunosuppres-
sion emerged during the study period [7], we present results
stratified by the HIV infection or AIDS status of the patients.
Results. Both the specific and sensitive algorithms suggest
that the number of IDU-related IE hospital discharges nation-
wide was substantially higher during period 4 (2002­2003) (ta-
ble 1), with slight to moderate fluctuations in the number of
these discharges during earlier periods. According to the specific
algorithm, there were 3858­5490 IDU-related IE hospital dis-
charges nationwide during periods 1­3. In contrast, during
period 4, the specific algorithm captured 9113 such dis-
charges--an increase of 66.0% over period 3. According to the
sensitive algorithm, there were 17,361­18,266 IDU-related IE
hospital discharges nationwide during periods 1­3. The sen-
sitive algorithm captured 24,025 such discharges during period
4--an increase of 38.4% over period 3. The x2 test indicates
that the number of discharges varied between each consecutive
period, with 1 exception (the number of cases captured by the
sensitive algorithm was statically identical for periods 1 and 2).
A qualitative review of these data indicates that the change of
greatest magnitude occurred between periods 3 and 4 for both
algorithms. Notably, the number of IDU-related IE hospital
discharges among people with HIV infection or AIDS decreased
substantially during the study period (table 1).
Discussion. Both algorithms indicate substantial increases
in the number of hospital discharges for IDU-related IE na-
tionwide between periods 3 and 4. To our knowledge, this is
the first time such a trend in IDU-related IE has been reported
nationwide, although another study reported an increase in
such hospitalizations in New York City during the period 1996­
1999 [4].
Possible causes of the observed nationwide increase merit
consideration. First, it is unlikely that the observed increase is
1202 · CID 2007:45 (1 November) · BRIEF REPORT
an artifact of changing IE diagnostic criteria. The Duke criteria
have been the standard diagnostic tool for IE since 1994 [8].
Modifications proposed to the Duke criteria in 2000 likely pro-
duced greater diagnostic specificity with little change in sen-
sitivity among IDUs [8].
Second, available data indicate that the increase in the num-
ber of IDU-related IE hospitalizations was not produced by an
increase in the size of the at-risk population (i.e., IDUs). An
ongoing National Institute on Drug Abuse­funded study sug-
gests that the number of past-year IDUs nationwide remained
relatively constant during the study period (unpublished data
from the Community Vulnerability and Response to IDU-
related HIV project 5R01DA013336).
Third, the observed increase in the number of IDU-related
IE does not appear to be a function of increasing prevalence
of 2 factors associated with IE among active IDUs: HIV-related
immunosuppression and cocaine injection. We found that cases
of IDU-related IE among patients with HIV infection or AIDS
decreased markedly during the study period--a finding con-
sonant with past research that may reflect the advent of HAART
and HIV-positive individuals' improved access to addiction
treatment [7]. Likewise, drug treatment admissions data, which
are often used as a marker of population trends in substance
use, indicate that the number of treatment admissions of per-
sons who injected cocaine was relatively stable during periods
3 and 4 [9].
Given the rising prevalence of community-acquired methi-
cillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in the United
States, we investigated whether this bacterium might have con-
tributed to the observed increase in the number of IDU-related
IE hospital discharges. Our analyses indicate that, although
codiagnoses of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. au-
reus infection among IDU-related IE hospital discharges indeed
increased during the study period, this increase did not coincide
with the increase in IDU-related IE hospital dischargesobserved
here.
Possibly, the increase in the number of IDU-related IE is
part of a broader increase in the number of IE overall, partic-
ularly given recent increases in the number of people who are
vulnerable to IE (e.g., elderly individuals and people with pros-
thetic valves) [6]. Our algorithms, however, excluded such vul-
nerable populations, and we suspect that, because of distinct
causal mechanisms, the incidence of IDU-related IE follows a
different temporal trend from that of non-IDU-related IE [1].
By reviewing (1) the known causes of IDU-related IE and
(2) documented changes occurring during the study period in
the contexts in which IDUs use drugs, we identified the mech-
anisms that may have recently increased the incidence of IE
among active IDUs. First, increasing methamphetamine use
may be such a mechanism, because drug treatment admissions
of persons who currently use methamphetamine increased na-
tionwide during the period 1996­2003, with the steepest in-
crease occurring during 2001­2002 (admissions increased by
23% during these 2 years, from 133,971 in 2001 to 164,916 in
2002, and then increased again by 7% in 2003, to 176,764) [9].
Methamphetamine use (regardless of the mode of administra-
tion) induces a host of cardiac complications that are similar
to those induced by cocaine, including vasospasm and injury
to the myocardial surface [10]. Hypothetically, methamphet-
amine injection may increase IE risk through pathophysiologic
mechanisms similar to those proposed for cocaine. A second
mechanism may be increasing injection frequency among her-
oin injectors. The mean price of heroin decreased by 40%, from
$403 per pure gram in 1995 to $241 per pure gram in 2002
[11]. Dramatic price decreases may have allowed increased in-
jection frequency among individuals who were already injecting
heroin. Increased injection frequency provides more oppor-
tunity to introduce skin flora into the circulatory system.
The primary limitation of our study was the absence of codes
denoting IDU in the International Classification of Disease,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification system. We addressed this
limitation by constructing 2 algorithms to identify cases of
interest; one was designed to be specific, and the other was
designed to be sensitive. Both algorithms suggest that IDU-
related IE hospital discharges increased during the period 2002­
2003--a concordance that reveals convergent validity.
Research regarding whether the 2 mechanisms proposed
above or other mechanisms (acting alone or in combination)
have produced the observed increase in the number of IDU-
related IE cases is needed so that effective interventions can be
established to stem IE among IDUs. Meanwhile, organizations
serving IDUs could educate IDUs and health care providers
about IE symptoms, so that affected individuals could obtain
medical care as early as possible.
