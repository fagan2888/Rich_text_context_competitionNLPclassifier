Impact of socioeconomic status
on Brazilian elderly health
Impacto do status socioeconômico
na saúde de idosos brasileiros
ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of socioeconomic status on elderly
health.
METHODS: The study was based on cross-sectional data from Survey on
Health, Well-Being, andAging in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean. The sample
comprised 2,143 non-institutionalized elderly aged 60 years and older living
in the urban area of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil. Linear regression models
estimated the effect of socioeconomic status indicators (years of schooling
completed, occupation and purchasing power) on each one of the following
health indicators: depression, self-rated health, morbidity and memory capacity.
A 5% significance level was set.
RESULTS: There was a significant effect of years of education and purchasing
power on self-rated health and memory capacity when controlled for the
variables number of diseases during childhood, bed rest for at least a month due
to health problems during childhood, self-rated health during childhood, living
arrangements, sex, age, marital status, category of health insurance, intake of
medicines. Only purchasing power had an effect on depression. Despite the
bivariate association between socioeconomic status indicators and number of
diseases (morbidity), this effect was no longer seen after including the controls
in the model.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results confirm the association between
socioeconomic status indicators and health among Brazilian elderly, but only
for some dimensions of socioeconomic status and certain health outcomes.

RESUMO
OBJETIVO: Investigar o impacto do status socioeconômico na saúde de
idosos.
MÉTODOS: Utilizou-se a base de dados transversal Inquérito sobre a Saúde,
o Bem estar o Envelhecimento na América Latina e Caribe. Analisaram-se
2.143 idosos (60 anos ou mais) residentes em domicílios, na área urbana
de São Paulo, no ano de 2000. Modelos de regressões lineares estimaram o
efeito dos indicadores de status socioeconômico (anos de estudo completos,
ocupação e poder de compra) nos indicadores de saúde: depressão, auto-
avaliação da saúde, morbidade e capacidade de memória. O nível de
significância adotado foi de 5%.
RESULTADOS: Observou-se efeito significativo dos anos de estudo e do
poder de compra na auto-avaliação da saúde e na capacidade da memória,
quando controlado pelas variáveis: número de doenças antes dos 15 anos
de idade, ter ficado na cama ao menos por um mês por problema de saúde
antes dos 15 anos, auto-avaliação da saúde na infância, arranjos de vida,
sexo, idade, estado civil, tipo de seguro de saúde, ingestão de remédios.
Somente a capacidade de compra apresentou efeito na depressão.Apesar das
análises bivariadas indicarem uma associação entre status socioeconômico
e o número de doenças (morbidade), este efeito desapareceu quando os
controles entraram no modelo.
CONCLUSÕES: Os resultados confirmam a associação entre indicadores
socioeconômicos e a saúde dos idosos brasileiros, mas somente entre alguns
indicadores e certos aspectos da saúde.

The impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on elderly
health is controversial. Some studies show that older
adults with high SES have better health than those with
low SES,2,15,18 but other studies show that the strength of
this association decreases, or even disappears, among
older ages.1,5,10 However, there are very few studies
about this relationship in developing countries.13,21
Most experts hold that SES differences in health are
produced as a result of various health-related fac-
tors such as living and working conditions, access to
health care services, social relationships, and diversi-
fied lifestyles.6,14 SES differentials in health may also
result from health selection. People with preexisting
illness drift down the social scale: those with poor
health are selected into lower SES through decreased
labor force participation or through withdrawal from
paid work.24
Some studies have shown that health variations in adults
are attributed to both early and later life circumstances,7
suggesting that childhood SES has lasting effects on
health beyond its impact on later status attainment.
Other studies did not find a significant association be-
tween childhood SES and later health once adult SES
is taken into account.16
The relationship between SES and health is shown to be
strong, regardless of how SES is measured, whether via
income,11 occupation8 or education.1,17 However, there
is no consensus about the idea that in old ages there is
no difference in health among different SES.
According to House et al9 social stratification of aging
and health is produced by social and biological mecha-
nisms which determine both exposure to and the impact
of a set of psychological variables. House et al9,10 argued
that socioeconomic differences in health (morbidity)
increase through early old age and do not converge
until later old age (i.e., age 75 and older).
Despite the numerous studies about this subject, the
majority of them were carried out in developed coun-
tries and little attention has been given to developing
countries.13,21
The objective of the present study was to investigate
the impact of SES on health in older ages and how
this relation changes when controlled for confounding

variables in a developing country. The hypothesis is
that due to the great distance between social strata and
unequal access to adequate health care in Brazil, SES
has a significant impact on elderly health. The knowl-
edge about the impact of SES in the elderly health is
crucial for developing policies and because older adults,
particularly those at more advanced ages, are a fast
growing population segment.
METHODS
The study was based on cross-sectional data from
the Survey on Health, Well-Being, and Aging in
Latin America and the Caribbean (SABE),* which
was funded by the Pan American Health Organization
and coordinated by the Center for Demography and
Ecology on the University of Wisconsin ­ Madison.
In Brazil, it was coordinated by Faculdade de Saúde
Pública, Universidade de São Paulo.
The sample comprised 2,143 individuals aged 60 years
and older living in private households in urban areas
in the city of São Paulo, during the year 2000. It was
generated through a multistage process by conglomer-
ates with stratification of the units at the highest levels
of aggregation.
Most interviews were carried out directly with the
aged and only 12.9% of them were carried out with a
substitute or proxy. However, the main variables were
not obtained from questions answered by proxies.
Missing cases were less than 5%. There were 12% of
missing cases for depression symptoms and 16% for
number of diseases under the age of 15. There were
no significant differences between respondents and
non-respondents, tested by logistic regressions on the
independent variables.
Individual analysis for different age groups were not
performed as recommended in the literature (Elder4
1999) as there were not enough cases for that.
Four measures of health in adulthood were examined:
memory capacity, depression, self-rated health and
morbidity.
Memory capacity was assessed using Folstein8 Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE), a recall test, which
included words and numbers showed to subjects in a
certain order, in different moments during the interview
process.
For studying depression, the Yesavage Geriatric De-
pression Scale24 was used with 15 dummy variables.
The number of depressive symptoms was a count of the
affirmative responses, with three items tapping positive
affect reverse coded.
Self-rated health was based on a 5-point scale ranging
from poor to excellent. This measure captures respon-
dents' overall assessment of their own medical and
functional status.
In regard to morbidity, respondents indicated whether
they have ever been told by a doctor that they have/
had cancer, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular
disease, chronic lung illnesses, high blood pressure or
arthritis/rheumatism. Seven dummy variables indicated
the presence of each disease. Prior research7 has shown
substantial agreement between surveys self-reports
of medical conditions and medical record reports of
major medical conditions in representative samples in
the United States. The number of chronic conditions
was the total number reported, ranging from zero to
seven.
The independent variable was the adult's SES, corre-
sponding to respondent's own education, purchasing
power and main occupation in life. Education was
measured in complete years of schooling.
Purchasing power was assessed by the ownership of
goods, which in Brazil reflect social class position
(Associação Brasileira de Empresas de Pesquisas**
­ BrazilianAssociation of Marketing Research). Those
items are: automobile, refrigerator, washing machine,
water boiler, microwave oven, telephone, VCR/DVD
player, stereo system, fan, air conditioner and heater.
Main occupation was based on the International Stan-
dard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) of the Inter-
national Labor Organization (ILO). Based on Waitzman
& Smith,23 occupations were added into three categories
and converted into three dummy variables. The first
category was high status occupation (jobs requiring
high education, offering opportunities, well-paid, and
involving technical work and independent decision
making); the second category was medium status oc-
cupation (craft jobs requiring some years of education
and affording latitude in decision making); the third was
low status occupation (often machine-paced and subject
to strict timetables, rules and supervision and with little
security and opportunity). High status occupation was
the reference category in the multivariate models.
The variable "income" was not used due to the exces-
sive number of missing cases (86.4%).
Although the literature emphasizes people's childhood
SES should be known in order to understand adult's

The average age was 73.28 years (SD=8.46) and 59%
were female, 35.1% had private health insurance and
64.8% said they did not have it.
As for dimensions of SSE, mean score for education
was 3.01, SD=1.24). This variable had 1.1% of miss-
ing cases. In terms of occupation, subjects tended to
have low occupational status (71.3% of the sample),
which was associated with poor self-evaluation of
their SES during childhood (p0.05). Interviewees
with low occupational status evaluated their SES dur-
ing childhood as poor as those with high occupational
status, thus showing the predominance of low social
mobility in Brazil.
Those who positively rated their health during child-
hood not always rated their current health in a positive
way. Specifically, among those who rated their health
during childhood as good, 12.1% of them rated their
current health as bad; 44.4% as regular; 33.9% as
good; 2.4% as very good and 7.3% as excellent. The
ANOVA test for self-rating of health between past and
current number of diseases was statistically signifi-
cant: the highest number of diseases is related to the
lowest health rating categories. The Tukey Post hoc
test identified significant differences in terms of the
average number of diseases between good and excel-
lent categories.
An ANOVA test showed a significant association be-
tween self-rating of health and the number of depressive
symptoms, where the highest means were seen in the
lowest health rating categories.There was no significant
difference among positive categories.
Another ANOVA showed significant association be-
tween memory capacity and self-rated health, the high-
est means were in the positive health rating categories
but without significant difference between good, very
good and excellent categories.
Self-rating of health was not affected by childhood
characteristics, differently than that expected (Model
1; Table 1). Education had a positive effect on the
subjective rating of health (Model 2). Even after con-
trolling this effect was reduced but still statistically
significant. The purchasing power followed the same
pattern, i.e., after controlling for confounders, it had
a greater effect on self-rated health compared to the
education effect. Therefore, only some dimensions of
SES have an impact on the way Brazilian older adults
rate their health.
The controlling variables that had a negative effect on
this indicator of health were: morbidity (number of
diseases), depression (number of depressive symptoms)
and intake of medicines. As expected, self-rating of
health was affected by physical and mental health.
health, this is not problematic in Brazil because social
and intra-generational mobility is not so frequent.19
Thus self-rated childhood SES was included in the
models as a control.
Controlling variables were the following:
Childhood SES ­ Respondent's rating of SES as a
child was coded on a 3-point scale ranging from poor
to very good.
Childhood health ­ Respondent's rating of health as a
child was coded on a 5-point scale ranging from poor to
excellent. Although retrospective reports of childhood
health are subject to recall bias and measurement error,
previous studies5 found a high level of internal consis-
tency between reports of general health and specific
long-term health limitations in childhood. Other measure
of childhood health was obtained as a dummy variable
from the question if the subjects had to remain in bed
at home for one month or more due to a health condi-
tion under the age of 15. The last measure of childhood
health was the total number of diseases under the age of
15, which ranged from zero to seven and involved the
same set of diseases used to measure adult number of
present chronic conditions. Height was also included as a
control, indicating health problems during childhood.
Other controlling variables were sex and age, mari-
tal status, living arrangements, intake of medicines,
smoking, category of health insurance, and physical
exercise, defined as regular physical exercise in the
last six months.
After the descriptive analysis, four regression models
were constructed for each adult health outcome. Model
1 included childhood SES and health only. Model 2
added SES indicators. Model 3 added other health indi-
cators in adult life, indicators of comorbidity for each of
the dependent variables were included along with age,
gender and living arrangements. Model 4 added risk
behaviors and category of health insurance. Statistical
analyses were performed using the SPSS version 14.0.
Multicolinearity was not a problem.
RESULTS
The scores for memory capacity were summed and total
score ranged from zero to 19, (mean=16.11, SD=3.05),
with an alpha coefficient of 0.77. The depression scale
ranged from zero to 15 (mean=2.99, SD=1.05) with an
alpha coefficient of 0.80. The mean of self-rated health
was 2.5 (SD=0.90). The alpha coefficient for morbidity
scale was 0.72 (mean=1.52, SD=0.18). The respondents
generally reported few health problems during child-
hood (mean=0.97, SD=0.37).
The SSE ranged from zero to 12, mean was 6.39
(SD=2.19) and reliability alpha coefficient was 0.70.

Table 2 shows the results of a multivariate analysis of
SES on morbidity of the elderly. SES childhood evalu-
ation had a significant negative effect on morbidity,
even after controlling for other confounders. Another
childhood-related variable that had positive effect on
current number of diseases was the number of diseases
under the age of 15, but this effect was no longer seen
with current health characteristics. SES did not have a
statistically significant effect on morbidity. The number
of depressive symptoms and intake of medicines have

a significant positive effect on morbidity. Maybe the
latter is a reciprocal effect but this was not possible to
be tested. Physical activities appeared to contribute for
reducing the current number of diseases.
The multivariate analysis showed that education had a
significant positive impact on memory capacity even
after controlling for confounders (Table 3). Occupa-
tion had positive impact on memory capacity: those
in high status occupation had high scores in terms of
memory resources than those in lower status occupa-
tion. However, the effect of occupation disappeared in
the presence of controls related to current health status.
Age had an important impact on memory capacity, as
memory capacity decreases with aging. Depression also
had negative impact on memory capacity and height
had a positive effect.

sented in Table 4. Health during childhood had a posi-
tive and significant impact on the current number of

adulthood had a significant positive impact on depres-
sion. Education had a weak effect on depression, which
was no longer seen after controlling. The only SES in-
dicator that had a significant negative effect on depres-
sion was purchasing power. Age, physical activity and
smoking had a negative impact on depression. Women
reported fewer depressive symptoms than men.
DISCUSSION
Except for morbidity, at least one indicator of SES had
a significant effect on other three health indicators (self-
rated health, memory capacity and depression).
The lack of SES effect on morbidity can be explained
by the study sample, which comprised elderly people in

whom the majority of diseases are related to the aging
process. Thus, these diseases could not be prevented or
postponed even if these people would have knowledge
gained through education.
Those subjects who rated their health during their
childhood as poor now rate it positively. This may be
due to the many health problems suffered in the past,
that nowadays, with the new generation of medicines
and vaccination available, they can better manage
their health. Thus, they tend to positively rate their
current health. To verify this assumption, an ANOVA
was performed to test these differences, but it was not
statistically significant. With regard to other health
measures, there were no variables available to verify
this association.
The association between education and memory ca-
pacity is possible to be explained in the sense that it is
expected that those older adults with more educational
resources (formal knowledge) should be those who
exercise more their memory functions.
The impact of purchasing power on memory capacity
can be understood in the extent to which those older
adults who have more access to certain types of goods,
like those related to communication and media resourc-
es, can have more chance to exercise their memory.
The effect of high status occupation on memory capac-
ity is explained by the fact that high status occupations
are those that involve more intellectual challenges than
the low status occupations, these last involve more
manual activities.
One explanation to the positive and significant impact
of childhood health on adult depression could be that
the severity of childhood health problems are more
important than the absolute number of conditions on
mental health status later in life. The negative impact
of smoking on depression can be related to the fact that
nicotine has a stimulating effect on mood.
The impact of number of diseases during childhood on
adult depression happens because many diseases can
cause limitations and dependency. Unfortunately the
information about disability could not be used in this
study due to excessive number of missing cases.
The fact that only purchasing power has an impact on
depression can be explained by the huge inequality of
Brazilian society and, as mentioned before, low social
mobility. Thus, Brazilians tend to value the ownership
of certain goods, not only as a way to have access to a
variety of resources and social position but also to be
socially recognized and accepted.3
The present study has potentially important implications
as it shows health cannot be approached as a unique
homogeneous concept and can provide information for
developing social policies. Also, it confirms that SES
and childhood events are important to explain elderly
health problems. This emphasizes the importance of
preventive policies not only for older adults but also
for early ages.
Other strength of the study is the use of a life course per-
spective in a developing country context, even though
there was no longitudinal data available. It is possible to
argue that taking childhood characteristics into account
provided information about subject's life course. Some
health indicators in adult later life may be the outcome
of a variety of childhood conditions and experiences.12
By using those retrospective questions was possible, at
some extent, to compensate for the fact there was no
longitudinal data to use a life course perspective.
However, the present study has some limitations. First,
it was not possible to check whether the impact of SES
on health varies by age group as there were not enough
cases in each group to perform individual analysis. Sec-
ond, income was not used in the study due to the exces-
sive number of missing cases.Third, as aforementioned,
data were gathered at one point in time and therefore
it was not possible to conclude that SES causes health
problems in late life. However, other studies10,15 have
not shown evidence of reverse causality, that is, that
poor health conditions lead to low SES. Another inter-
pretation problem of cross-sectional studies is survival
bias. It is expected that subjects with poor childhood
SES have lower survival rates. However, it is possible
that low social mobility in Brazil tends to attenuate the
differences between those who survived.
A fourth limitation arises from the fact that data were
based solely from self-reports and childhood events
using retrospective questions. However, it is believed
that whenever people are informed by their doctor they
have a health problem it means a real and serious health
problem. There is controversy in the literature over the
reliability and validity of retrospective reports of health
events. There is clearly no way to deal with this issue
given the data available in the present study.
Another limitation is the external validity. This sample
is representative of a major Brazilian city and a destina-
tion of migrants from other parts of the country but it
cannot be assured these results can be generalized to
the whole country.
Regardless of those limitations, the study results
showed a relationship between SES and health status
in late life in developing countries, and also a need for
further longitudinal research in these countries.
In conclusion, the study results do not fully corroborate
previous results of other studies that there is a lack of
association between SES and health among elderly
population. However, they show that not all SES in-
dicators have an effect on specific health dimensions.
There is a need for developing policies taking into
account different health dimensions and different SES
indicators individually.
