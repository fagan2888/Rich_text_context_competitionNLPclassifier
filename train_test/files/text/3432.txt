Abstract. Despite the importance of the arts in human life, psychologists still know relatively little
about what characterises their experience for the recipient. The current research approaches this
problem by studying people's word usage in aesthetics, with a focus on three important art forms:
visual art, film, and music. The starting point was a list of 77 words known to be useful to describe
aesthetic impressions of visual art (Augustin et al 2012, Acta Psychologica 139 187­201). Focusing
on ratings of likelihood of use, we examined to what extent word usage in aesthetic descriptions
of visual art can be generalised to film and music. The results support the claim of an interplay
of generality and specificity in aesthetic word usage. Terms with equal likelihood of use for all
art forms included beautiful, wonderful, and terms denoting originality. Importantly, emotion-related
words received higher ratings for film and music than for visual art. To our knowledge this is direct
evidence that aesthetic experiences of visual art may be less affectively loaded than, for example,
experiences of music. The results render important information about aesthetic word usage in the
realm of the arts and may serve as a starting point to develop tailored measurement instruments for
different art forms.
Keywords: aesthetic impressions, word usage, art forms, emotiveness, empirical aesthetics.
1 Introduction
Aesthetic activities in a broad sense, and the arts in particular, constitute an important part
of many people's lives (McManus and Furnham 2006). Even though not offering a clear
advantage at first sight, going to a museum or the opera, listening to music, or watching a
film are pastimes that seem to provide reward in themselves, as many people seek them over
and over again (eg, Leder et al 2004). In view of such ubiquity and importance of different
kinds of art it is astonishing that we still know relatively little about the characteristics of
recipients' experiences of different art forms. Such relative ignorance is rather typical of the
field of empirical aesthetics, which, after first blossoming in the seminal work of Fechner
(1876) and the new experimental aesthetics approach by Berlyne (1974), has just started
to come of age in the past few years (see, eg, Chatterjee 2011). The current study aims to
add to our understanding of aesthetic experiences of different art forms by exploring the
impressions that they leave on the recipient.
Before we go further into this issue, some definitions are important: According to Leder et
al (2004) an aesthetic experience comprises the entirety of cognitive and affective processes
involved in an encounter with an artwork, from mere perceptual processes to measurable
"outputs" in terms of an aesthetic judgment and an aesthetic emotion. As it is certainly difficult
to grasp the entire experience through empirical measures (see also Leder et al 2005), we
focus on aesthetic impressions in the following study. We define aesthetic impressions as
320 M D Augustin, C C Carbon, J Wagemans
all cognitive and affective results of an aesthetic experience that are object-related (rather
than undirected, such as a mood-state) and that can at least theoretically be verbalised into
aesthetic judgments (Augustin et al 2012).
The current study asks what characterises aesthetic impressions of different art forms
for the recipient. It approaches this question through people's word usage, as proposed by
a series of authors (Augustin et al 2012; Istok et al 2009; Jacobsen et al 2004), following the
idea that language is key to meaning (Osgood et al 1971). One certainly has to be aware
that this approach is not unproblematic. For example, the relation between language and
meaning is supposedly not a direct one, but moderated by further factors such as the range
of terms in question or the speaker's native language (Adachi 2003) and how this language
allows speakers to verbalise their experiences. In our approach we conceive of language as
one window to meaning--which does not allow an undistorted view but compared to other
(especially indirect) measures probably still offers relatively straightforward insights. Our
study follows up on a recent paper (Augustin et al 2012), in which we analysed aesthetic word
usage for a variety of visual object classes, including visual art, faces, landscapes, patterns,
and several design categories. We found that aesthetic word usage in the visual domain
is characterised by an interplay of generality and specificity: Beautiful and ugly obviously
possess universal relevance (see also Jacobsen et al 2004), but in addition, different object
classes show different patterns of word usage--each including both terms shared with some
of the classes (such as modern for the design categories or symmetrical for faces, patterns,
and houses) as well as terms that are specific for the particular class (such as soothing for
landscapes or interesting for visual art).
In the present study we aim to find out to what extent this interplay of generality and
specificity holds true within the realm of the arts. Hence, we do not concentrate on the visual
domain alone, but rather employ three "classical" art forms that address different modalities
(visual, auditory, and visual + auditory) and supposedly cover a wide spectrum of different
likes and dislikes of many people: visual art, music, and film. In particular, we ask to what
extent terms that have shown to be useful to describe aesthetic impressions of visual art
can be used for impressions of film or music. Is there something like a universal language
for the arts or rather specific aesthetic vocabularies based on art form? What are universal
descriptors for aesthetic impressions? And what constitutes the similarities and differences
in aesthetic word usage between visual art and the other two aforementioned art forms?
So far, one can only try to answer these questions indirectly, by comparing the results of
studies that were conducted with different samples, different instructions, and in different
languages. For example, Augustin et al (2012) found that the term beautiful was the most
frequently listed one when people were asked which words they would use to describe
their aesthetic impressions of visual art and other visual object classes. In general, the most
frequently mentioned words for visual art referred to the aspects of beauty, style, colours,
and to the idea of being special or original. In a previous study, Istok et al (2009) focused
on words that might be used to describe the aesthetic value of a musical piece. They also
found that beautiful was by far the most frequent reply, but in their study it was often listed
together with touching. That seemed to be part of a general pattern of people mentioning
relatively many terms related to emotions and moods, such as also sad or emotional. An
attempt to compare the results by Augustin et al (2012) with those of Istok et al (2009)--as far
as that is possible, given the differences in language and the different samples (Augustin et al:
178 Dutch-speaking students and members of the department of psychology versus Istok et
al: 290 Finnish-speaking students from different faculties)--thus indicates that descriptors
of emotions and moods are more frequent when people describe aesthetic impressions of
music than when they describe aesthetic impressions of visual art. On a more abstract level,
Aesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music 321
aesthetic responses to music might be more emotional or affectively loaded than aesthetic
responses to visual art. Such a notion is perfectly in line with anecdotal reports by many
people, and also seems to be indirectly reflected in the empirical literature, where one finds
a growing body of work on the topic of emotions in music (eg, Konecni et al 2007; Zentner et
al 2008), much more than on emotions in art (eg, Kuchinke et al 2009).
To our knowledge there is no empirical data yet that allow a direct comparison of the
nature of aesthetic impressions among visual art, music, and film, including the amount of
emotiveness of the different art forms (for a meta-analysis on brain correlates of aesthetics
in different modalities, see Brown et al 2011). Important evidence comes from studies by
Baumgartner et al (2006a, 2006b), who compared emotion recognition and experience of
music, highly arousing photographs from the IAPS (International Affective Picture System)
database (Lang et al 2008), and the combination of pictures and music. Even though emotion
recognition was more accurate following pictures only than music only, both subjective
ratings and psychophysiological measures of emotion involvement (heart rate, respiration,
skin conductance) were stronger for the music and music plus picture conditions than
for pictures alone (Baumgartner et al 2006a). In addition, fMRI results suggested that the
combination of pictures and music, but not the presentation of pictures alone, was associated
with the activation of a large network involved in emotion processing (Baumgartner et al
2006b). It is important to note that the results by Baumgartner and colleagues focused on
the basic emotions of happiness, sadness, and fear (Baumgartner et al 2006a) and sadness
and fear (Baumgartner et al 2006b), respectively, making it unclear to what extent they hold
true for aesthetic emotions, too, which are supposedly different (Scherer 2005) and very
differentiated in nature (Zentner et al 2008). Whether a weaker emotiveness for the visual
modality can be transferred from relatively simple pictures to a multifaceted stimulus like
visual art or not demands further investigation.
The current study aims to approach the issue of possible differences in the nature of
aesthetic impressions by directly comparing aesthetic word usages between different art
forms, within one language and one sample of participants. This allows us to examine
hypotheses like the one on emotionality systematically and to crystallise similarities and
differences in aesthetic word usage up to the single word level. In contrast to the studies by
Jacobsen et al (2004), Istok et al (2009), and Augustin et al (2012), we do not ask participants
to freely come up with words. That method is doubtlessly very valuable if one wants to create
a first body of aesthetically relevant words (see below), but its results do not only depend
on the general relevance of words, but also on their fluency, ie, how quickly they come to
people's mind. This can have the consequence that some words are not mentioned at all,
because they are, for example, more difficult or unusual, even though they are theoretically
relevant for a class, and even though people may identify them as such if they are prompted
with words. In addition, one can only make direct comparisons of word usage between
different object classes if a term is mentioned for all classes. Based on these considerations,
the current research provided participants with a list of words. This list had been derived from
the above-mentioned previous study (Augustin et al 2012), in which participants had freely
named words they would use to describe aesthetic impressions of visual art. The list was thus
fully empirically based, with all pros (no theoretical bias towards certain words and actual
relevance and adequacy to people) and cons (range of words dependent on the sample's
choices and backgrounds). In the current study, a new group of participants was asked to
rate for each of these words how likely they were to use the word to describe their aesthetic
impressions of visual art, music, and film, respectively. As the list of words used had been
originally created for the realm of visual art, our analyses will primarily focus on comparing
the word usage for visual art with those for film and music, rather than making absolute
322 M D Augustin, C C Carbon, J Wagemans
statements about word usage for film or music or the relation of those two. This choice is
based on the assumption that a list created for visual art probably misses important terms
that are relevant only for film or music and thus does not allow a full picture of aesthetic
impressions of film and music.
Given the nature of the word list used, we expected its general likelihood of use to be
higher for visual art than for the other two classes--a result that can be expected unless the
aesthetic language for the arts shows no specificity at all. Even more importantly, we aimed
to compare the likelihood of use of each word, to find out what are universal descriptors of
aesthetics, what are words predominantly employed for the visual arts, and for which words
visual art is "beaten" by one or both of the other classes in terms of likelihood of use. We
furthermore had a look at patterns of similarities between visual art and the other two art
forms, and what these might imply as to the nature of the underlying aesthetic experiences.
Following up on Augustin et al (2012), this research was intended as a further step towards
a language of aesthetics, aiming to bring more systematics to the relatively confused field
of aesthetic terminology and to improve our understanding of what makes up aesthetic
experiences in different domains of art.
2 Method
2.1 Participants
Participants were 103 first-year students of psychology (88 women) from the University of
Leuven, with an age range of 17 to 24 years and a mean age of 18.6 years (SD = 1.1). All
participants were native speakers of Dutch. They received course credit for participation.
In terms of art background the sample could probably be regarded a sample of "interested
laymen", who on average visited 2.0 art exhibitions a year (SD = 2.6), owned 5.1 art books (SD
= 11.0), and expressed a medium interest in art (M = 3.9, SD = 1.4 on a 7-point scale from 1 =
"very low" to 7 = "very high"). All participants had given written consent.
From an original group of 111 participants, eight persons had been excluded prior to data
analysis, three since their mother tongue was different from Dutch, and another five due to
response tendencies (pressing the same key in more than 50% of cases).
2.2 Materials
The basis of our study was a list of 77 Dutch words that can be used to describe aesthetic
impressions of visual art. These words were derived from an earlier study (Augustin et al 2012)
in which we had asked 178 participants to come up with words that can be used to describe
aesthetic impressions of eight different object classes, including visual art. For details of the
method and the results, we refer the reader to the original publication. The current study
focused on the terms that the participants of the aforementioned study produced for the
domain of visual art. To make the terms optimally useful for our purposes, we conducted
some additional processing steps in addition to those described in Augustin et al (2012). An
important reason for this was that the list of terms used in that study was also to be used in
a field study with volunteers in a museum. With a view to this, it was important to choose
terms that can easily be applied to judge artworks, and here adjectives seem more useful
than nouns, even though a concentration on adjectives may possibly entail the loss of some
relevant aspects. The following pre-processing steps were taken:
· Further decomposition of phrases into their components. For example, "beautiful
colours" would be decomposed into "beautiful" and "colours".
· Where possible, verbs and nouns were turned into adjectives, to lose as little data as
possible. For instance, "colours" became "coloured", and "symmetry" "symmetrical".
Nouns for which we could not generate adjectives, because meaning changed or the
adjectives are rarely or never used in everyday speech (eg, "sculpture", "portrait", or
"patterns") were dropped.
Aesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music 323
From the resulting set we chose all terms that had been mentioned by at least two persons,
which yielded 103 different terms. With a view to the abovementioned field study to be
conducted in a museum, this number still seemed too extensive, especially if one counts
on people's voluntary participation. Consequently, we further reduced the set of terms to
reach a number similar to that used in comparable field studies in the arts (eg, Zentner et al
2008). This was done by asking three native speakers of Dutch to look for words that were
very close in meaning and could possibly be collapsed. The judges worked independently
from each other. Terms were presented in a list in alphabetical order. In those cases where at
least two of the judges agreed which terms could be collapsed, we chose the solution they
proposed. Within each group of collapsed terms, the term with the highest frequency in the
data of Augustin et al (2012) was chosen for the final list. If frequencies were the same, we
based the selection of the most representative word on the judges' opinions. The reached
solution was discussed by two of the authors (MDA and JW) to recheck that the final list
avoided doubles but still was well differentiated. In a few cases, groups of words were further
split up into two--for example, "interesting, fascinating, thrilling, intriguing" was split up
into "interesting + engaging" (= interesting) and "fascinating + intriguing" (= fascinating),
because the two subgroups signify very different intensities of experience.
2.3 Procedure
The study was an online study programmed in Java. The participants took part in the
framework of supervised test sessions in a computer room of the KU Leuven. After filling
in general information about their age, gender, native language, and field of study, the
participants received the following instruction (translated from Dutch):
In this study we are interested in your language use: Which terms do you use often, which
terms do you use rarely and how is that related to the situation? We are most interested in your
language use with respect to aesthetics. Which words would you use to describe your aesthetic
impressions? We will thus present you three times with an object category, together with a list
of words. Please concentrate on the object category and rate each word on the list with respect
to the question: Would you use this word to describe your aesthetic impressions of objects of
the particular class?
The participants were asked to give their rating on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (very
unlikely) to 7 (very likely). Ratings for visual art, music, and film were conducted in separate
blocks. The order of the blocks was randomised, as was the order of the list of terms within
each block. In the instructions for each block we stressed the fact that it was not about what
the participants think about particular films, music, or artworks, but about which terms they
would use when they talk about film, music, or art, respectively.
After the three rating blocks, the participants were asked three questions related to their
background and interest in art, which have proven useful in previous studies (Augustin et al
2012; Leder and Carbon 2005): how many art exhibitions they visited a year; how many art
books they owned; and how strong they regarded their interest in art to be, on a 7-point scale
from 1 (very low) to 7 (very high). Overall, the study took about 20 minutes.
3 Results
The mean ratings of likelihood of use across all words were 4.79 (SD = .93) for visual art, 4.44
(SD = .91) for film, and 4.21 (SD = .86) for music, all lying above the value 4, the theoretical
midpoint on the scale 1 (very unlikely) to 7 (very likely). We suppose that terms with means
below this value are relatively unlikely to be used, while terms with means above this value
have a relatively high likelihood of use. A repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
with art form as within-subjects factor yielded a main effect of art form, F1, 102 = 36.49, p
2=
.264. According to tests of simple main effects, all three values differed significantly from
324 M D Augustin, C C Carbon, J Wagemans
each other, with p-values < .001. These data suggest that the terms used in this study were
generally suitable to describe aesthetic impressions of all three art forms, but most suitable
for visual art, and still more suitable for film than for music. Figure 1 shows the mean ratings
of likelihood per art form, for each of the 77 terms separately. For ease of orientation, we
added a vertical black line in the figure at the theoretical midpoint of the scale, the value 4.
Figure 1. Mean likelihood of use of each of the 77 terms (translations of the original Dutch terms) for
the three art forms, visual art, music and film. The black line marks the value 4, the midpoint of the
7-point scale used (1 = very unlikely to 7 = very likely).
To statistically compare the values for each term between the art forms, we conducted
repeated measures ANOVAs on the likelihood-of-use ratings for each term, with art form as
within-subjects factor (for most important results see Table 1). Seven of the terms, figurative,
historical, interpretable, meaningless, sharp, moving (in the physical sense), and flowing lay
below this value for all three art forms. Following the logic explained above, we interpret this
as a general lack of relevance of these terms, and thus dropped them from further analyses,
to continue with a reduced set of 70, which are all likely to be used for at least one of the art
forms.
Inspection of Figure 1 suggests that the terms beautiful, wonderful, original, and special
are very important for all three art forms, while for terms like detailed, colourful, abstract, or
expressive there seem to be relatively strong differences between the classes. An important
observation with respect to the current literature on aesthetics is the likelihood of use of the
term beautiful as compared to other terms: In the case of visual art, beautiful theoretically
obtained highest likelihood ratings, but did not differ significantly from the second and third

most likely terms for visual art, colourful and wonderful, F2, 204 = 2.27, ns. For both music
and film, good even reached higher values than beautiful. In the case of film, this difference
was significant, as shown by a within-subjects ANOVA for the three most likely terms for film,
good, touching, and beautiful, F2,204 = 3.43, p = .034, p
2 = .033, p-value of significant simple
main effect <.01.
Since there were 70 separate analyses, the alpha level was adjusted according to Bonfer-
roni to p = .05/70 = .000714. F-values for the significant ANOVAs ranged between 7.85 and
131.62. Terms that are equally likely to be used for all art forms include, on the one hand,
terms like beautiful, wonderful, and awful, and on the other hand, meaningful and dreamy,
and finally, terms related to the idea of being special, like original, special, ordinary, and
innovative. Specificity of a term for an art form can theoretically come in different shapes:
clear specificity, (ie, highest values for that particular art form and low likelihood of use of
the term for any of the other art forms) or more in the sense of a tendency towards that art
form (ie, highest likelihood of use for the art form but also still relatively strong likelihood of
use of the term for at least one of the other two art forms). To be able to make a distinction
between these two different forms of specificity, we again used the value 4 as cut-off criterion
between unlikely (values below 4) and likely terms (values above 4).
With respect to visual art, it is specific terms related to outer appearance and depiction,
like colourful, abstract, or big, as well as style-terms like expressionist and impressionist, but
also the term expressive that are clearly art specific. A visual art tendency can be found for the
term ugly, as well as for some terms related to creativity and uniqueness, like creative, artistic,
striking, and unique. In contrast, we found that several emotion-related terms have a film
and music tendency (significantly higher values for both film and music than for visual art)
or a music tendency (significantly higher values for music than for visual art and film), even
though their likelihood of use for visual art is still relatively high. This applied to emotional,
touching, sad, and happy, respectively, of which emotional and touching were actually more
likely for film than for music. With the exception of the term happy, music alone obtained
higher likelihood ratings than did visual art and film for classical on the one hand and some
mood-related words on the other hand, restful, cheerful, while words with a film tendency
related to plot, tension, and interestingness, such as dramatic, boring, interesting, or shocking.
There was one term that was film-specific, the term ridiculous.
We approached the issue of differences between the art forms also in a different manner,
by conducting correspondence analysis (CA). CA allows one to plot objects (in our case:
art forms) and attributes (in our case: terms) in a common space to find underlying
dimensions and compare profiles. The reason why we did not choose Discriminant Analysis
to differentiate between the groups was that the relation between sample size and number
of variables was clearly smaller than suggested in the literature (1.47 in our case compared
to the minimum value of 2.0 suggested by Backhaus et al 2003). Furthermore, even though
CA entails a loss of data level in our case (see below), it allows to span general dimensions
according to which the differences between groups can be described.
To be able to point out differences in the profiles of relevant aesthetic terms between
the art forms, we went for an asymmetrical, column-principal solution, with art forms in
the rows and terms in the columns (see Backhaus et al 2003). Since CA relies on nominal
data, our rating data were transformed to categories by counting each case where an art form
received a rating higher than 4 on a certain term as a classification of that art form under
that term. For example, if a person assigned a value of 5 to impressive for visual art and of 3
to music, visual art would be counted as classified in the category impressive, while music
would not. A comparison of the CA solution with the ANOVA results shows that the former
supports and clearly crystallises the latter (see Figure 2). Since there were only three objects,
Aesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music 327
the two dimensions found explain 100% of the data. Column 3 and 4 of Table 2 contain the
contributions of each term and art form to the two dimensions. Figure 2 visually illustrates
the CA solution. Dimension 1, which accounts for 55.9% of the data, is dominated by visual
art and contrasts it to music (25.8%) and film (11.6%). As to terms, the dimension is mostly
characterised by abstract, expressionistic, impressionistic, colourful, and big. Highest loadings
on the other side of the dimension can be found for cheerful, touching, and emotional.
To summarise, one could say that it is outer appearance versus emotion that differentiates
aesthetic word usage for visual art from that for both film and music. Dimension 2 accounts
for 44.1% of the data and differentiates film (55.3%) from music (43.6%). The terms with high
loadings on this dimension are gentle, classical, and soothing, on the one hand (closer to
music), and realistic, shocking, confusing, well though-out, and ambiguous on the other hand
(closer to film). So what seems to contrast music from film in our data could be summarised
as mood and style versus content.

the same space. Note that we chose an asymmetrical column-principal-solution, which visually
exaggerates the differences between the art forms.
The preceding results primarily focused on differences in likelihood of use between the
three art forms studied, both over all terms and on single-term level. In the following, we go
further into the issue of similarities, focussing on the amount of coherence in likelihood
ratings over terms and persons. Pearson's product-moment coefficients between the rating
patterns over terms (n = 70) for each combination of art forms were r = .31 (p < .05) between
art and film, r = .24 (p < .05) between art and music, and r = .55 (p < .001) between
330 M D Augustin, C C Carbon, J Wagemans
film and music. A repeated measures ANOVA with the Fisher-Z-transformed values of
the correlations per term as dependent variable showed all three correlations to differ
significantly from each other, F2, 138 = 357.65, p < .001, p
2= .838.
Next, we asked the question: What are the terms that make up the core of the similarities
of aesthetic word usage for visual art with film and music, respectively? The idea of this
analysis was to find groups of terms for which rating behaviour between visual art and music
and visual art and film, respectively, was most coherent over persons. Starting points were
Pearson's correlations across persons between the rating patterns for each of the 70 terms,
calculated separately for the combinations visual art and music as well as visual art and film.
The values can be found in columns 5 and 6 of Table 2. We will refer to these correlations as
coherence scores in the following. The coherence scores were backward-ordered according
to size (see x-axes of Figures 3a and 3b).
Figure 3. Illustration of the core of similarities in aesthetic word usage between visual art and the other
two art forms, (a) music and (b) film. Terms are ordered from left to right according to the amount
of coherence (correlation over persons for that particular term) with visual art. The lines show the
correlations between the means for visual art and music (red) and visual art and film (blue), calculated
peu à peu starting from the three terms with the highest coherence. Dashed lines mark the dominant
breaks in the correlations.
As we were interested in terms that play an important role in similarities, we included
only those terms that had a mean rating of at least 4 (theoretical midpoint on our scale from
very unlikely to very likely) for both art forms involved and could thus be considered to be
rather likely to be used for both. The order of terms based on the coherence scores was then
used to subsequently produce correlations between the mean ratings of terms between
the two respective classes, starting from the three terms with the highest inter-art form
coherence and subsequently adding terms according to their coherence score. Figure 3a­b
graphically illustrates the order of the terms (x-axes) and the resulting correlation patterns.
Aesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music 331
So, for example, for the combination art and music we would start by correlating the
means for ordinary, nice, and talented and then subsequently add unique, then special,
and so forth. Of particular interest were possible breaks in these patterns: From which
term on does the correlation between the art forms decline rapidly? Similarly to the logic of
Cattell's Scree plot, the terms appearing before the break were considered as constituting
the core of similarities in aesthetic word usage between the two respective classes. As can
be seen, the most dominant break in the correlation pattern between art and music (apart
from a large drop between talented and unique, which is difficult to interpret due to the
very small number of values in the correlation) happens after exaggerated. If we try to
summarise the general pattern, the similarity-relevant terms include beauty-related terms
like beautiful, nice, and wonderful, the terms dreamy and lively, a relatively large number of
terms related to originality or uniqueness (eg, ordinary, special, and unique), a few terms
linked to comprehensibility (eg, bizarre and chaotic) and terms that seem to be related to
profoundness (profound, dramatic). As to the similarities between art and film, a strong
break in the correlation pattern can be found behind absurd. Therefore, the terms most
important for the similarities between visual art and film seem to be beautiful, dreamy, and
chic, the two originality-related terms ordinary and innovative and several terms related to
comprehensibility, bizarre, strange, unbelievable, and absurd.
4 Discussion
The current study focused on aesthetic word usage for three different art forms that make
an important part of many people's lives--visual art, film, and music (eg, McManus and
Furnham 2006). How likely is it that people use certain terms to describe their aesthetic
impressions of visual art, film, and music, respectively? Knowledge of this issue is supposed
to provide important insights into the nature of aesthetic experiences of the three art forms
and to render useful information for the development of possible measurement scales.
Following up on a study by Augustin et al (Augustin et al 2012), in which participants freely
named aesthetic descriptors for eight different visual object classes, we could draw upon a
list of words which can generally be assumed to be useful to describe aesthetic impressions
of visual art. In the present research we tested a different sample of participants to find
out with which likelihood each of these words is used to describe aesthetic impressions of
visual art and to what extent such a pattern of aesthetic word usage can be transferred to
two other art forms, namely film and music.
First of all, our analyses show that the 77 terms used in this study were most likely
to be used to describe aesthetic impressions of visual art, and least likely to be used for
music. On the one hand, this validates the findings of our previous study through a different
method (likelihood-of-use ratings rather than free naming of terms) and for a new sample
of participants: a list of terms that has specifically been generated for visual art should
also under different circumstances be more likely to be used for visual art than for other
classes. On the other hand, differences in the mean likelihood of use for the three art
forms suggest that there is no such thing as a universal aesthetic language for the arts, but
that aesthetic word usage for different art forms is rather characterised by a substantial
degree of specificity per art form. More precisely, we find that the interplay of generality
and specificity that we identified for aesthetic word usage for different visual object classes
(Augustin et al 2012) also applies to the realm of the arts: General aesthetic terms that are
equally important for all three art forms examined here can be found alongside terms whose
likelihood of use clearly differs between the art forms.
An important observation in light of the literature on aesthetic word usage is the
difference in roles of the terms beautiful and ugly: Jacobsen et al (2004) claimed a primacy
332 M D Augustin, C C Carbon, J Wagemans
of beauty and supposed that beautiful and ugly span the central dimension of the aesthetics
of objects. Also, in our recent study on different visual object classes (Augustin et al 2012)
we found that those two terms were mentioned frequently for all object classes studied,
even though ugly was mentioned far less often than was beautiful. In the present study,
beautiful can indeed be found among the general aesthetic terms, but for none of the art
forms do the data speak for a primacy of beauty in terms of an absolutely highest likelihood
of use. Furthermore, ugly turns out to be of much less general relevance, being significantly
more likely to be used to describe aesthetic impressions of visual art than of film or music
and being even relatively unlikely for film (M = 3.29). Whether this reflects ugly being an
aesthetic term reserved for static visual stimuli in general (in contrast to dynamic visual or
auditory stimuli) or whether the just-described result is based on more subtle differences
between visual art, film, and music remains to be investigated by future research.
Coming back to general aesthetic terms, these include--apart from beautiful, wonderful,
and awful--dreamy, as well as a relatively wide range of terms related to the idea of being
special or innovative, like original, special, ordinary, or innovative. The relevance of dreamy
was already pointed out by Zentner et al (2008) with respect to descriptors of emotions in
music. According to their view, a term like dreamy could denote the ability of the arts to
make people "self-forgetful and somewhat detached from every day concerns" (p 513). The
high general likelihood of use of terms related to the idea of being special provides evidence
that originality is an aesthetic facet with an important role for aesthetic experiences of all
three art forms. This fits in with the view by Markovic (2012; Stevanov et al 2012), according
to whom fascination, rather than pleasure or liking, is a core aspect of aesthetic experience.
Which words are particularly likely to be used for visual art, more so than for music
or film? First of all, there is the above-mentioned word ugly. Second, there is quite a large
number of terms related to outer appearance or the depiction of content, like colourful,
abstract, dark, or big, most of which (apart from dark) seem to be visual art-specific
(ie, relatively unlikely for the other two art forms). This also includes stylistic labels like
impressionistic or expressionistic. In a way it seems logical that terms related to outer
appearance received the highest ratings for visual art, but cases such as colourful and dark
are not quite so obvious. At least the term colourful is relatively widespread when talking
about music (eg, Istok et al 2009), and the association between colours and music has a
long tradition, playing an important role in phenomena of synaesthesia (Jewanski et al
2009; Ward et al 2006) as well as in some artistic conceptions like those of Wassily Kandinsky
(Kandinsky 1994).
Two other interesting observations: The term expressive seems to be art-specific, and
some terms related to uniqueness, like striking, creative, and unique also received their
highest values for visual art. In contrast to the general aesthetic terms special, innovative, or
original, these terms thus may code aspects of being special or unique that are specific to
visual art.
We now turn to those aesthetic terms for which visual art is "beaten" in likelihood of
use by film and/or music. Highest likelihood for film is obtained for a number of words
related to plot, tension, and interestingness, like boring, dramatic, or shocking. A music
tendency can be found for several words related to style (classical) and to mood. As for the
latter aspect, the terms might denote some of the musical emotions identified by Zentner
et al (2008), for example, gentle (for Zentner et al: tenderness), cheerful (for Zentner et al:
joyful activation), and soothing (for Zentner et al: peacefulness).
Yet, the most central observation in the data seems to be that several emotion-related
words, such as emotional, touching, happy, and sad,obtained relatively high ratings for
visual art, and thus obviously do play an important role in our experience of visual art (see
Aesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music 333
also Di Dio et al 2007), but are still less likely to be used to describe aesthetic impressions of
visual art than to describe impressions of film or music or both. Emotional and touching
actually received even higher likelihood ratings for film than for music, while for the terms
happy and sad, which are assumed to refer to discrete emotions (Ekman 1992) instead of
general emotiveness, this was not the case. To our knowledge, this is the first direct empirical
evidence, following indirect evidence based on comparing, for example, the results by Istok
et al (2009) and Augustin et al (2012), that aesthetic encounters of music and of film might
on average be experienced as more emotional than encounters with visual art. This finding
fits in with the results that Baumgartner et al report for non-artistic pictures from the IAPS
database (2006a), namely that psychophysiological measures and emotional involvement
ratings were much stronger in reaction to music or to pictures plus music than for pictures
alone. Interestingly, the observation that visual art is less emotive than film or music is also
mentioned often in anecdotal reports, when people with a general interest in aesthetics
summarise their experiences of artworks.
What could be possible reasons? As for film, its power to elicit emotions seems quite
evident, since most films present fictional situations in which the characters on screen
experience all different kinds of emotions. There are relatively clear-cut genres, comedy,
tragedy, thriller, etc, for viewers to choose a priori among different possible emotional
sets. With the technical possibilities to create realistic scenes advancing and screen sizes
and, consequently also, presence, growing (Troscianko and Hinde 2011), the amount of
emotiveness of films even does not seem to be at its limits yet. Similarly, music is an
important means to share feelings and experiences and regulate social behaviour (Trehub
2003). This also makes it a traditional and very effective way of mood induction in the
laboratory (Baumgartner et al 2006a; Westermann et al 1996), even though the range
of emotions evoked by music probably differs from the range of emotions in "real life"
(Scherer and Zentner 2008; Zentner et al 2008). How music's power to elicit emotions
can be explained has been subject to scientific discussion over centuries (for a current
overview, see, for example, Perlovsky 2010). It is not the aim here to provide a comprehensive
overview of possible explanations, but we would like to mention two ideas: Perlovsky (2010)
proposed the hypothesis that music's emotive power is evolutionarily rooted rather than
accidental, with communication having split into one less emotive, semantic system, which
has evolved into language, and one very emotive but semantically ambiguous system,
which has evolved into music. An aspect of music that may also add to its emotiveness
is its power to elicit memories (eg, Schulkind et al 1999), which then, in turn, can trigger
emotional reactions--even though it has to be admitted that the direction of causality
between emotion (or mood) and memory is not clear here and is supposedly mutual.
Obviously, one can think of a number of possible reasons why aesthetic impressions of
film and music might be more affectively loaded than impressions of visual art. Regarding
the artistic means of the art forms, it is noticeable, though, that visual art has developed a
number of alternative ways to capture and attract viewers, especially in contrast to music:
Notwithstanding possible disadvantages on the emotional side, it has obvious advantages
on the content side, which, for example, make it easier to convey conceptual ideas. Likewise,
many artists make use of perceptual plays, including visual illusions (see Ramachandran
and Hirstein 1999; Van de Cruys and Wagemans 2011), which often need no or just a few
words of explanation in order to be understood. In contrast, grasping of musical structures
to become aware of surprising elements, ciphers, or the like, probably requires a significant
amount of ear training.
The results of the correspondence analysis validate the differences between the three art
forms that we pointed out above and yield a nice synthesis of the general tendencies. The
334 M D Augustin, C C Carbon, J Wagemans
first dimension found is dominated by visual art and by aesthetic terms related to visual
appearance, like abstract, expressionistic, or colourful. These are opposed to music and film
and terms related to mood and emotion, like cheerful, touching, or emotional. The second
dimension clearly differentiates film from music. Term-wise it contrasts aspects of plot,
tension, and comprehensibility (realistic, shocking, confusing, etc), on the one hand, to
descriptors of style and mood (gentle, classical, soothing, etc), on the other hand.
When we turn from differences to similarities, we first see that the correlations between
the likelihood ratings for the different art forms reflect their similarity and association
in real life. Music and film are difficult to discuss independently, since the latter hardly
ever goes without the former and films combine visual information and sound into an
intersensory whole (Chion 1994; Morris 2011). As for the combinations visual art­film and
visual art­music, both visual art and film are predominantly related to the visual modality,
whereas art and music differ not only in temporal extension (as do art and film) but also in
modality. Accordingly, the correlation between the ratings for film and music are highest,
followed by visual art­film and visual art­music, in this order. Even though the similarity in
aesthetic word usage between visual art and film is stronger than between visual art and
music, this similarity yet seems to be based on fewer terms (9 in comparison to 21 for visual
art and music). This becomes clearer when we analyse which terms constitute the core
of similarities in aesthetic word usage. Our data suggest that the core of the similarities
between visual art and film is made by beautiful, dreamy, and chic, two terms related to
the idea of being special (ordinary and innovative) and by a number of terms that relate to
comprehensibility, namely bizarre, strange, and absurd. Thus, one could summarise the
topics underlying the main communalities in word usage between visual art and film as
beauty, originality, and comprehensibility. In the case of visual art and music, the amount of
terms related to being special or unique (eg, special, innovative, interesting and ordinary) is
increased. We again find terms related to beauty, beautiful and wonderful, the term dreamy,
as well as terms that may describe aspects of comprehensibility (chaotic, bizarre, and
exaggerated, cluttered). As opposed to the relation between art and film, the core set of terms
also includes lively, as well as terms related to profoundness, like profound or dramatic. For
both film and music, the core of similarities with visual art obviously comprises ordinary,
bizarre, dreamy, beautiful, unbelievable, and innovative. We interpret this as a hint that
these terms might constitute a common denominator of aesthetic vocabulary for the arts
and might thus be very interesting candidates for instrument development in all three art
forms (see below).
This touches upon one of the most important questions regarding word usage in aes-
thetics: What can we learn from the data with a view to suitable measurement instruments
to assess aesthetic impressions? The issue of adequate measures constitutes one of the
major obstacles for experimental psycho-aesthetics (Locher 2011; Wagemans 2011). Our
data suggest, that, as has been shown for different visual object classes (Augustin et al
2012) and for music alone (Istok et al 2009), beautiful seems to be an equally safe choice
if one is looking for a single-item measure to assess aesthetic impressions of visual art,
film, or music. Additionally, though, one should also consider choosing terms that denote
aspects of originality, such as innovative. Another interesting candidate is the term dreamy.
Other facets of aesthetic experiences besides the ones just indicated probably depend
strongly on the art form under consideration. Future studies should thus systematically
try to find out what characterises these additional facets and then use this information
to develop standardised questionnaires to assess aesthetic impressions of different art
forms. We assume that for visual art the list used in this study can serve as a solid basis
for instrument development. To start with questionnaire development for film and music,
Aesthetic word usage for visual art versus film and music 335
additional studies seem necessary, since, as explicated in the introduction, the word pool
used in this study is "biased" towards visual art and might thus lack several terms that are
specifically suitable to describe aesthetic impressions of music or film or both. Researchers
with a particular interest in assessing aesthetic impressions of music may also first consult
the Geneva Emotion in Music Scale by Zentner et al (2008), which is a well-standardised
instrument to measure emotions evoked by music and thus probably provides a very good
way of approaching the emotional facets of aesthetic experiences of music.
All in all, our study suggests that the interplay of generality and specificity in aesthetic
word usage that we identified for a variety of visual object classes ranging from visual art to
cars to geometric patterns (Augustin et al 2012) can also be found within the realm of the
arts. Beautiful is equally likely to be used for visual art as for film or music, and the same is
true for terms like dreamy and unbelievable as well as several terms related to originality. On
the other hand, we find clear differences between the art forms in terms of likelihood of use
of other words. Whereas aesthetic descriptions of outer appearance are (naturally) mostly
specific to visual art, it is especially the likelihood of use of terms describing emotions
and moods that differentiates visual art from both film and music. Doubtlessly, aesthetic
experiences of visual art can be very emotional--but on average they may not have as much
emotive power as experiences of film or music. Several aspects certainly have to be kept
in mind. First, our participants were students of psychology (mostly women) in their late
teens and early twenties and not a sample of experts for any of the three art forms. Inferring
from everyday experience as well as from data by McManus and Furnham (2006) about
the aesthetic habits of a big sample of mostly young adults and teenagers, we assumed
that the participants' interest and involvement with music and film was on average higher
than with visual art. Such differences in the personal relevance of and familiarity with the
different art forms may possibly lead to biases in judgments, especially with respect to the
amount of emotionality associated with the given art form. Furthermore, our study was
limited to the Dutch language and thus has to be interpreted within the Belgian/Dutch
cultural and language framework. Research has shown that language use and meaning
may differ strongly between different cultures (Evans and Levinson 2009), and this, for
example, also affects the verbal coding of emotions (Matsumoto and Assar 1992; Russell
1991). Therefore, future studies should not only systematically examine and consider the
role of different kinds of expertise but also of cultural background and native language.
Cross-cultural investigations will be able to reveal to what extent the effects reported here
are universal or rather language-dependent. Another important aspect regarding future
studies concerns interdisciplinary cooperation. Given that the field of language use and its
relation to meaning is a very complex one (see our indication of possible problems in the
introduction), cooperation between psychologists and linguists seems very promising, in
order to understand the phenomenon of aesthetic word usage in a more holistic way by
combining the specific fields of expertise and methodological approaches.
As written in our previous paper (Augustin et al 2012), there is still a lot of work to do
in the realm of aesthetic word usage and terminology, but since we are convinced it may
teach us a lot about the phenomenon of aesthetic experiences, this work definitely seems
worthwhile.
