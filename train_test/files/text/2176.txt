Context: Estimates of DSM-IV disorder prevalence are
high; stringent criteria to define need for services are de-
sired.
Objective: To present US national data on the preva-
lence and sociodemographic correlates of 12-month se-
rious emotional disturbance (SED), defined by the US Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,
from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Ado-
lescent Supplement.
Design: The National Comorbidity Survey Replication
Adolescent Supplement is a national survey of DSM-IV
anxiety, mood, behavior, and substance disorders among
US adolescents.
Setting: Dual-frame household and school samples of
US adolescents.
Participants: Total of 6483 pairs of adolescents aged
13 to 17 (interviews) and parents (questionnaires).
Main Outcome Measures: The DSM-IV disorders were
assessed with the World Health Organization Compos-
ite International Diagnostic Interview and validated with
blinded clinical interviews based on the Schedule for Af-
fective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Chil-
dren. Serious emotional disturbance was operational-
ized as a DSM-IV/Composite International Diagnostic
Interview disorder with a score of 50 or less on the Chil-
dren's Global Assessment Scale (ie, moderate impair-
ment in most areas of functioning or severe impairment
in at least 1 area). Concordance of Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview SED diagnoses with blinded
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for
School-Age Children diagnoses was good.
Results: The estimated prevalence of SED was 8.0%. Most
SEDs were due to behavior (54.5%) or mood (31.4%) dis-
orders. Although respondents with 3 or more disorders
made up only 29.0% of those with 12-month DSM-IV/
Composite International Diagnostic Interview disor-
ders, they constituted 63.5% of SEDs. Predictive effects
of high comorbidity were significantly greater than the
product of their disorder-specific odds ratios and con-
sistent across disorder types. Associations of sociodemo-
graphic variables with SED were generally nonsignifi-
cant after controlling for disorder type and number.
Conclusions: The high estimated 12-month preva-
lence of DSM-IV disorders among US adolescents is largely
due to mild cases. The significant between-disorder dif-
ferences in risk of SED and the significant effect of high
comorbidity have important public health implications
for targeting interventions.

EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEYS CON-
sistently find that more than
one-fourth of all US chil-
dren and adolescents meet
criteria for 1 or more re-
cent DSM-IV mental disorders.1,2 This pro-
portion is so high that it raises questions
about the clinical significance of DSM-IV
criteria3 and about estimates of the mag-
nitude of unmet need for treatment.4 Con-
sistent with these questions, research has
shown that, as with adults,5 prevalence es-
timates of child and adolescent mental dis-
orders decrease substantially when spe-
cial impairment requirements are imposed
in making diagnoses.6 Nonetheless, pre-
cise data on the population severity dis-
tributions of child and adolescent mental
disorders are lacking.
This report presents data on severity
distributions for DSM-IV mental disor-
ders among the adolescents who partici-
pated in the US National Comorbidity Sur-
vey Replication Adolescent Supplement

(NCS-A).7 To our knowledge, the NCS-A is the first sur-
vey in the United States to assess a wide range of DSM-IV
disorders in a national sample using fully structured di-
agnostic interviews. We distinguish DSM-IV disorders that
do vs do not qualify for the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration definition of serious emo-
tional disturbance (SED),8 focusing on disorder-
specific distributions and sociodemographic correlates.
Previous research6,9 has estimated that 4% to 13% of US
adolescents meet 12-month criteria for SED, although
none of the previous studies of SED was based on a na-
tional sample using a fully structured diagnostic inter-
view. Previous NCS-A reports described the sample de-
sign,7,10 measurements,11 and validity of diagnostic
assessments7,10-12 along with lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV
disorders.13 A companion article2 in this issue docu-
ments that the disorders assessed in the NCS-A are highly
prevalent and persistent throughout adolescence.
METHODS
SAMPLE
The companion article2 in this issue describes the sample in
detail. In brief, adolescents (aged 13-17) were interviewed from
February 5, 2001, through January 31, 2004, in parallel house-
hold (n=904; 86.8% response rate) and school (n=9244; 82.6%
response rate) samples.7,10 The high percentage (72.0%) of non-
participating initially selected schools in the school sample was
replaced with matched replacement schools that were shown
in a methodologic study to yield prevalence data comparable
with those obtained in the household sample from students in
nonparticipating schools.10 One parent-surrogate of each par-
ticipating adolescent was asked to complete a self-admin-
istered questionnaire about the adolescent's developmental his-
tory and mental health (82.5% conditional response rate in the
household and 83.7% in the school sample). This report fo-
cuses on the 6483 adolescent-parent pairs with complete data.
Incomplete parent data were taken into consideration by weight-
ing procedures discussed elsewhere.7,10
Parental written informed consent and adolescent assent were
obtained before completing the surveys. Each respondent was
given $50 for participation. The recruitment consent proce-
dures were approved by the human subjects committees of both
Harvard Medical School and the University of Michigan. Weights
were used for within-household probability of selection and de-
viation from census population sociodemographic or geo-
graphic distributions, and the household and school samples
were then merged with adjustments for differential design ef-
fects.7,10
MEASURES
Diagnostic Assessment
As described in more detail in the companion article,2 adoles-
cents were administered the fully structured Composite Inter-
national Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)14 modified to simplify lan-
guage and use examples relevant to adolescents.11 The 15 DSM-IV
disorders that were assessed included mood disorders, anxi-
ety disorders, behavior disorders, eating disorders, and sub-
stance disorders. There were no other exclusionary diagnoses.
The DSM-IV distress and impairment criteria and organic ex-
clusion rules were used in making diagnoses. Hierarchy rules
were used with the exceptions of oppositional-defiant disor-
der with or without conduct disorder and substance abuse with
or without dependence. Briefer parent questionnaires as-
sessed disorders for which parent reports have previously been
shown to play a large part in diagnosis: behavior disorders15
and depression and dysthymia.16 As described in more detail
in the companion article,2 an NCS-A clinical reappraisal study
documented good concordance between diagnoses based on the
CIDI and diagnoses based on blinded clinical reappraisal in-
terviews.12 Parent and adolescent reports in the CIDI were com-
bined at the symptom level using an "or" rule (except in the
case of attention-deficit disorder for which only parent re-
ports were used for evidence of low validity of adolescent re-
ports) because results showed that this optimized concor-
dance with blinded clinical diagnoses.
Disorder Severity
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra-
tion defines SED as "a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emo-
tional disorder of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic crite-
ria specified within DSM-III-R," and "that resulted in functional
impairment which substantially interferes with or limits the
child's role or functioning in family, school, or community ac-
tivities."8(p29425) This definition was operationalized in the NCS-A
clinical reappraisal study by defining respondents with 1 or more
12-month DSM-IV Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizo-
phrenia for School-Age Children disorders as serious (SED) cases
if they scored 50 or less on the Children's Global Assessment
Scale (CGAS).17 A CGAS score of 50 or less can be obtained
either by having moderate impairment in functioning in most
areas of living (eg, fears and anxieties that lead to gross avoid-
ance behavior, episodes of aggression, or antisocial behavior)
or severe impairment in at least 1 area (eg, suicidal preoccu-
pation and ruminations or frequent anxiety attacks). Respon-
dents who were not classified as having an SED were classified
as moderate cases if they had CGAS scores of 51 through 60
(variable functioning, with sporadic difficulties in several but
not all areas of living) and mild cases otherwise.
Although the CIDI adolescent survey and parent question-
naire included many measures of impairment, they could not
be used to construct CGAS scores directly because the latter
are based on clinical ratings. However, we were able to use these
survey measures to generate a close approximation of CGAS.
This was done using regression-based imputation, a standard
approach for establishing individual-level estimates of miss-
ing data in large-scale surveys in which information on impor-
tant variables is missing for some cases.18 In this approach, data
available in the survey that are known from some other data
set (in this case, the NCS-A clinical reappraisal sample) to pre-
dict the missing variable are used to generate a prediction equa-
tion for that variable in the other data set. The coefficients from
that prediction equation are then used in the main survey to
generate predicted values of the missing variable. When the pre-
dictors are strongly related to the missing variable, as was the
case in the NCS-A impairment variables predicting CGAS scores
in the NCS-A clinical reappraisal sample, quite accurate indi-
vidual-level measures of the missing variable can be generated
in this way.
Cross-validated stepwise regression analysis performed in
the NCS-A clinical reappraisal sample using information about
12-month DSM-IV disorder prevalence and severity was used
to predict clinical ratings of SED. (Detailed results are avail-
able on request from the corresponding author.) The area un-
der the receiver operating characteristic curve, a measure of con-
cordance that is fairly insensitive to prevalence,19 showed that
the estimate of SED based on the prediction equation had strong
individual-level concordance with clinical ratings in compari-

son with both moderate or mild (0.85) and mild (0.82) disor-
ders. On the basis of these results, the coefficients in the pre-
diction equation were used to estimate whether each respondent
in the larger NCS-A sample met criteria for serious, moderate,
or mild 12-month disorder. These imputed scores were then
used as outcomes in a series of logistic regression analyses per-
formed in the total NCS-A sample to study the substantive pre-
dictors of SED. To build in information about imputation in-
accuracy to significance tests, the multiple imputation20 method
was used to adjust estimates of standard errors.
Sociodemographic
Variables
Sociodemographic variables examined as predictors of SED in-
clude age, sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other), parental educational level
(less than high school, high school, some college, or college
graduate), family income (low [defined as no more than 1.5
times the official federal poverty line], low-average [1.5-3 times
the poverty line], high-average [3-6 times the poverty line], or
high [6 times the poverty line]), number of siblings, birth
order, number of biological parents living with the adoles-
cent, urbanicity (census metropolitan areas, nonmetropolitan
urban counties, and rural counties), and census region (North-
east, Midwest, South, or West).
ANALYSIS METHODS
The distribution of disorder severity was examined for each 12-
month DSM-IV/CIDI disorder using cross-tabulations. Multi-
variate regression models were then used to predict log-odds
of SED among respondents with disorders from information
about the type and number of disorders. This analysis was per-
formed only in the subsample of respondents with a 12-
month DSM-IV/CIDI disorder because the focus was on the pre-
dictors of severity among respondents with disorders. Both
additive and nonadditive models were considered, and the best-
fitting model was selected using the Bayesian information cri-
terion.21 The regression coefficients and standard errors from
the best-fitting model were exponentiated to produce odds ra-
tios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Population-attributable risk propor-
tions (PARPs) were calculated to estimate the proportion of se-
rious cases associated with each disorder that would not have
occurred in the absence of a given predictor disorder or set of
disorders under the model if the regression coefficients repre-
sented causal effects of the predictor disorders. The simula-
tions were produced by generating a predicted probability of
each value on the severity distribution twice for each respon-
dent from the best-fitting model: the first time using all model
coefficients and the second time setting to zero the coeffi-
cients associated with the predictor disorder(s) of interest. Popu-
lation-attributable risk proportion was defined as 1-R, where
R represents the ratio of the mean predicted probability in the
second specification divided by the mean predicted probabil-
ity in the first specification. So, for example, if the mean pre-
dicted probability decreases by 30% after deleting a given set
of predictor disorders, PARP would be defined as 0.30.
As the NCS-A data are both clustered and weighted, the de-
sign-based method of jackknife repeated replications based on
the 42 NCS-A sampling strata was used to produce standard
errors of logistic regression coefficients. The coefficients and
standard errors were exponentiated to produce ORs and 95%
CIs. The significance of predictor sets was evaluated using Wald
F tests based on design-adjusted coefficient variance-
covariance matrices. Statistical significance was consistently
evaluated using 2-sided tests with an  level of .05.
RESULTS
PREVALENCE AND SEVERITY OF 12-MONTH SED
The estimated prevalence (SE) of 12-month SED is 8.0%
(1.3%) among NCS-A respondents with complete ado-
lescent-parent data. Given that the estimated 12-month
prevalence of any disorder is 42.6% (1.2%), then 18.8%
(8.0%÷42.6%) of respondents with a disorder meet cri-
teria for SED (Table 1). Much higher proportions of cases
are rated either mild (58.2%) or moderate (22.9%). The
highest proportions rated serious are associated with con-
duct disorder (59.8%) and oppositional-defiant disor-

der (43.8%). Adolescents who meet criteria for 3 or more
12-month disorders are significantly more likely to be
rated serious (43.1%) than those with 2 disorders (12.1%)
or 1 disorder (8.5%) (F2,39
=17.7; P.001). Indeed, al-
though respondents with 3 or more disorders make up
less than one-third (29.0%) of people with 12-month dis-
orders, they constitute nearly two-thirds (63.5%) of those
with SED.
MULTIVARIATE ASSOCIATIONS OF DISORDER
TYPE AND NUMBER WITH SED
The best-fitting model to predict SED among respon-
dents with 1 or more 12-month disorders includes 14
dummy predictor variables for type of disorder (com-
pared with the omitted category of separation anxiety dis-
order) plus summary measures from exactly 2 to 4 or more
distress disorders (ie, generalized anxiety disorder, post-
traumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder, ma-
jor depression, or dysthymia) or behavior disorders. (De-
tailed results of model-fitting are available on request.)
The type-of-disorder coefficients are significant as a set
(F13, 28
=52.9; P.001), indicating that disorder types dif-
fer in risk of SED (Table 2). By far the highest OR is
associated with conduct disorder (18.4), followed by de-
pression (4.5) and panic disorder (3.9).

considered global interactions between number and type

aBased on a model that includes predictors for 14 of the 15 types of disorders (compared with the omitted category of separation anxiety disorder); counts of
2, 3, and 4 or more distress or behavior disorders; and controls for independent sociodemographic variables (ie, age at interview, sex, and race/ethnicity). See
Table 2 in the companion article2 in this issue for information on 12-month prevalence of disorders. By independent sociodemographic variables we mean the
subset of sociodemographic variables that could not plausibly be caused by the respondent's SED. This was the best-fitting model from a wide variety of models
compared using the Bayesian information criterion as the measure of model fit. Model selection was not sensitive to the criterion used because other criteria
examined also selected this as the best-fitting model. The 14 disorder-specific ORs differ significantly among themselves (F13,29
= 52.9; P  .001), whereas the 3
number-of-disorders coefficients are significant as a set (F3,39
= 3.4; P = .03). Asterisks indicate OR is significant using 2-sided tests with an  level of .05.
bThe PARP is the proportion of cases of SED predicted under the model to be due to each of the disorders considered here. See the "Analysis Methods"
subsection in the "Methods" section for a description of the simulation method used to calculate PARP. The PARP estimates do not sum to 100% because PARP is
calculated by deleting 1 disorder or class of disorders from the model at a time, resulting in the effects of comorbidity being included in each of the estimates.

eWith or without agoraphobia.
fSeparation anxiety disorder is the contrast category, with an implicit OR of 1.0.
gEating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating behavior.
hWith or without dependence.
iNo predictor variable for having exactly 1 disorder was included in the model because this would have been collinear with the coefficients associated with the
individual disorders. The disorder-specific coefficients consequently can be interpreted as effects of pure disorders (ie, disorders that occur to respondents who
have exactly 1 disorder), whereas the coefficients associated with numbers of disorders can be interpreted as deviations from the ORs associated with the
products of these disorder-specific effects among respondents with more than 1 disorder.

of disorders, are also significant as a set (F3,39
=3.4; P=.03)
because of a strongly elevated OR associated with hav-
ing 4 or more disorders (6.1).
This elevated OR means that incremental increases in
ORs associated with high comorbidity are greater than
the product of their disorder-specific ORs. The dra-
matic increase in risk of SED among adolescents with 4
or more disorders can be seen graphically by comparing
the observed distribution with the predicted probabili-
ties of this outcome among respondents with 1, 2, 3, and
4 or more disorders in the additive and interactive mod-
els. The Figure shows clearly that the interactive model
is much more consistent with the observed data than is
the additive model.
The fact that the interactive model with a single term
for 4 or more disorders fits the observed data better than
a model that allowed for a separate interaction between
numberandeachofthe15separatetypesofdisordermeans
that the interactive effect of number of disorders is fairly
consistent across the range of disorder types considered
here. That is, the multiplier of the 4-way interaction co-
efficientovertheexpectedvaluebasedonanadditivemodel
is relatively constant for all the 4-way interactions in the
data. Further exploratory analysis found no evidence of
differential importance of particular disorders in the 292
distinct 4-way interactions observed among disorders in
the sample. (Detailed results are available on request.)
POPULATION-ATTRIBUTABLE
RISK PROPORTIONS
Calculation of PARPs shows that much higher propor-
tions of SED are due to behavior disorders (54.5%) than
to mood (31.4%), anxiety (10.9%), or substance (1.9%)
disorders (Table 2). The PARP components across all dis-
orders sum to more than 100% because the calculation
of PARP is made by deleting a single disorder at a time,
which means that the effects of comorbidity are counted
multiple times. The disorders with the highest PARPs are
conduct disorder (35.9%), major depression (30.0%), op-
positional-defiant disorder (15.6%), specific phobia
(9.8%), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(8.4%). The high PARP for conduct disorder occurs de-
spite a relatively low prevalence (5.4%) because of the
high OR of conduct disorder predicting SED (18.4). The
high PARP for depression, in comparison, is due to the
conjunction of a high prevalence (13.3%) with a high OR
(4.5). The lower, but nonetheless substantial, PARPs as-
sociated with oppositional-defiant and attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorders are due to intermediate preva-
lence (8.3%-6.3%) and moderately elevated ORs (2.5-
3.1), whereas the high PARP associated with specific
phobia is due to high prevalence (16.3%) in conjunc-
tion with a modestly elevated OR (1.6). Eating disor-
ders are the only behavior disorders without signifi-
cantly elevated ORs, raising the question whether eating
disorders should be thought of as behavior disorders.
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CORRELATES
Sociodemographic variables are significant overall pre-
dictors of SED among respondents with 12-month dis-
orders (F25,14
=250.3; P.001) (Table 3). Relative odds
in the multivariate model are elevated among respon-
dents who are age 16 (1.5 compared with ages 13-14),
whose parents are high school graduates or had some
post­high school education (1.5-1.6 compared with col-
lege graduates), and who live with neither or only 1 bio-
logical parent (5.2-1.9, respectively, compared with those
living with both parents). Serious emotional distur-
bance is significantly less prevalent among non-
Hispanicblacks(0.6comparedwithnon-Hispanicwhites).
No other significant associations exist in the multivari-
ate model between any of the sociodemographic vari-
ables considered here and SED. Further analyses found
that bivariate associations do not differ markedly from
the multivariate associations reported here. (Detailed re-
sults are available on request.)
Sociodemographic variables also predict SED when we
control for type and number of disorders (F25,14
=119.4;
P.001), although the only individually significant so-
ciodemographic factor is being non-Hispanic black (0.8
compared with non-Hispanic whites). We found no sig-
nificant interactions between type and number of disor-
ders and sociodemographic variables. (Detailed results
are available on request.)
COMMENT
Three important sampling limitations are noteworthy: that
the school-level response rate was quite low, that the in-
dividual-level response rate was relatively low, and that
the sample excluded adolescents not enrolled in school,
the homeless, and non-English speakers. Methodologic
analyses reported elsewhere10 reduce concern about the
first limitation because no evidence of bias due to school
replacement was found. However, the finding in previ-
ous methodologic studies that nonrespondents have rates
of mental illness higher than those of respondents im-
plies that the second limitation most likely led preva-

aBased on a multivariate model that includes all the sociodemographic correlates as predictors of SED estimated in the subsample of respondents with 1 or
more 12-month disorders. The model with controls also includes as predictors the variables in the best-fitting model of type and number of disorders in Table 2.
See Table 1 for the distribution of the sociodemographic predictor variables. Asterisks indicate OR is significant using 2-sided tests with an  level of .05.
bEducational level was coded at the higher of the 2 levels when parents differed in levels of education.
cFor classification of family income, see the "Sociodemographic Variables" subsubsection in the "Measures" subsection in the "Methods" section.
dAlthough respondents with no siblings are coded 0 on all 3 number of siblings dummy variables, the category of having 0 siblings is identical to the category
of being an only child in the birth order variable. As a result, the coefficients in the number of siblings variable (2 or 3 siblings) are contrasted with the deleted
category of having 1 sibling.

estimates of disorder-specific associations with SED.22
The third limitation reduces the generalizability of our
findings.
Two other noteworthy limitations involve measure-
ment. First, diagnoses were based on fully structured ado-
lescent lay interviews and parent self-administered ques-
tionnaires, the latter assessing only a subset of diagnoses.
Second, imputation was used to define disorder sever-
ity. Concern about the first limitation is somewhat re-
duced by the good concordance of survey diagnoses with
blinded clinical reappraisal diagnoses,12 although sur-
vey prevalence estimates of simple phobia and opposi-
tional-defiant disorder are substantially higher than clini-
cal estimates. The second limitation is likely to have
introduced imprecision but not bias into the prevalence
estimate of SED, but it could have introduced bias into
estimates of the associations of specific disorders with
SED to the extent that we predicted SED associated with
some disorders better than SED associated with other dis-
orders.23
In the context of these limitations, the finding that the
high overall 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV/CIDI dis-
orders in the NCS-A is due largely to mild cases (58.2%)
is consistent with previous studies of children24 and
adults.25 Serious emotional disturbance is found among
8.0% of all adolescents (18.8%  42.6%), an estimate in
the middle of the range of previous prevalence esti-
mates.9,24,26 The finding that behavior disorders are as-
sociated with the highest risk of SED (3 of the 5 highest
PARPs) is consistent with data from a number of previ-
ous studies.24,26,27 The finding that depression and panic
disorder are also associated with an elevated risk of SED
is consistent with evidence from previous studies of both
children24 and adults.5
The finding of only 8.0% of 12-month disorders meet-
ing criteria for SED is not a reflection of the overdiag-
nosis of 12-month disorder in the CIDI. Indeed, as noted
earlier, our clinical reappraisal study showed clearly that
the CIDI does not substantially overdiagnose DSM-IV dis-
orders.12 It is quite a different matter to ask whether these
results suggest that the current DSM-IV system overdi-
agnoses, a position taken by a number of commenta-
tors.28,29 However, this is an issue well beyond the scope
of this report. A related issue is whether these results im-
ply that only a small proportion of youths with a DSM-IV
disorder needs treatment. Again, this is an issue that goes
beyond the scope of this article. However, a case might
be made for the appropriateness of nonintensive treat-
ment for even the mildest of cases (eg, short-term be-
havioral treatment of specific phobias). Furthermore, mild
adolescent disorders are powerful predictors of serious
adult disorders.30
The finding of a strong positive interaction involving
highcomorbidity(4disorders)predictingSEDisbroadly
consistent with evidence in previous studies that comor-
bidity is associated with high severity.31-33 The existence
of this interaction in conjunction with evidence from the
NCS-A as well as other studies34-36 that a substantial pro-
portion of adolescents have high comorbidity raises the
question whether the parcellation of symptom clusters
into many different disorders in DSM-IV is correct. How-
ever, this issue far exceeds the scope of this article. A more
tractable issue is that the interaction has important im-
plications for intervention targeting. In particular, if the
primary goal of intervention is to treat the bulk of youths
with current serious disorders, our results suggest that
the focus should be on disorders with the highest PARPs,
which include a trio of 3 behavior disorders (conduct dis-
order, oppositional-defiant disorder, and attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder) and depression, with a special em-
phasis on multimorbidity37 (ie, 4 disorders). However,
if cost-effectiveness is also an intervention goal, we have
to consider that previous research has found treatment
effectiveness to be lower among patients with certain,38
although not all,39 comorbidities. The rational response
to these complexities is far from obvious because we are
aware of no data to evaluate the relative effectiveness of
intervening early with pure cases to prevent the onset of
comorbidity vs targeting cases that are already comor-
bid as a focus of special attention. Some consideration
of the timing and content of comorbidity is needed to op-
timize the value of outreach efforts from a public health
perspective.
We found few sociodemographic correlates of SED
among respondents with 12-month disorders. How-
ever, in the earlier companion article in this issue2 we
documented significant sociodemographic correlates of
12-month prevalence of individual disorders consistent
with those found in previous studies. This means that
sociodemographic variables, while systematically corre-
lated with the presence vs absence of disorders, are for
the most part not systematically related to severity of dis-
orders among people with 12-month disorders. The stron-
gest sociodemographic correlate of severity of 12-
month disorders is not living with both biological parents.
However, this association becomes nonsignificant when
we control for type and number of disorders, suggesting
that type and number of disorders mediate the associa-
tion between living with biological parents and SED. Fur-
ther analysis (results available on request) showed that
the high prevalence of behavior disorders among ado-
lescents not living with their biological parents explains
the gross predictive effect of this sociodemographic vari-
able. Race/ethnicity is the only sociodemographic vari-
able that remained significantly related to severity after
controlling for type of disorder, with non-Hispanic blacks
having significantly lower odds of SED than non-
Hispanic whites with the same profile of disorders. This
finding might be thought of as inconsistent with the re-
sults of the National Health Interview Survey, which re-
ported higher rates of SED among non-Hispanic black
and Hispanic youths than non-Hispanic whites,40 but the
comparison is inappropriate because we focused in this
report on predicting severity among adolescents with dis-
orders rather than among all adolescents. The seeming
inconsistency of our failure to find strong socioeco-
nomic predictors of SED with previous studies26 can be
understood in the same way, as the juxtaposition of these
results can be interpreted as meaning that the associa-
tions of sociodemographic variables with SED are due to
more basic associations with specific disorders. Serious
emotional disturbance, according to this interpretation,
is much more a function of multivariate disorder pro-
files than sociodemographic predispositions, with high

comorbidity playing an especially critical role. Finally,
whether the bulk of youths with SED are the unlucky few
who happen to have 4 or more separate disorders or those
who have an as-yet undefined single disorder that is poorly
characterized in the current DSM-IV system is an issue
that, although beyond the scope of this investigation, re-
quires close examination in future studies.
