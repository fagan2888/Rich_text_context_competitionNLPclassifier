Oftentimes, women in abusive relationships display extreme
strength and resilience. However, the stereotypical image
associated with abused women is one of passivity, where
women experience psychological dysfunction as the vio-
lence escalates (Rothenberg, 2003; Stark, 2007; Walker,
1979). Previous research has identified the ways in which
women in abusive relationships attempt to establish auton-
omy and seek help (Abraham, 2005; Gondolf & Fisher, 1988;
Rajah, 2007; Stark, 2007). Yet, the narrative most often asso-
ciated with intimate partner violence is one of passivity.
Victims, who resist the abuse and seek out help from agen-
cies, may face hurdles accessing services, as they do not
coincide with the notion of a "typical victim." The intimate
partner violence story should be retold from the perspective
of the woman who talks and/or demonstrates strength and
resistance in a situation labeled intimate partner violence.
Yet, when retelling the intimate partner violence story it is
also important to consider the multiple aspects of the wom-
an's life. Though intimate partner violence results from the
structural inequalities between genders, gender oppression is
just one form of oppression women experience. A woman's
race, gender, religion, ethnicity, and/or sexual orientation can
influence the resistance strategies available to her. A wom-
an's resistance strategies may also be affected if she is in the
process of leaving her abuser or if she still is in a relationship
with him. The goal of this paper is to retell the intimate part-
ner violence story and identify structural reforms that are
consistent with the experience of intimate partner violence
survivors.
Dynamics Underlying Intimate Partner
Violence
More than 90% of individuals who experience intimate part-
ner violence are female, making it a gender-based crime
(Roberts & Roberts, 2005). Even though intimate partner
violence is a gender-based crime, the dynamics of abusive
relationships differ from couple to couple. This is best cap-
tured by the gender symmetry and asymmetry debate. Some
couples involve men and women who are both violent, but
are not afraid of each other. Johnson (1995) calls this com-
mon couple or situational couple violence, because it is an
argument between equals that escalates into violence.
Common couple violence reflects gender symmetry in vio-
lence because there are equal numbers of males and females
who physically assault their partner during an argument. This
type of violence in intimate relationships is typically found
in large-scale national surveys on violence in relationships
(Dobash & Dobash, 2004; Johnson, 1995). Common couple
violence may be a momentary response to a frustration, not a
continuous systematic effort to control one's partner. Though
common couple violence challenges the conception that

Women's Resistance Strategies in
Abusive Relationships: An Alternative
Framework
Brittany E. Hayes1
Abstract
Though abused women are often depicted in the media as passive, women in abusive relationships often resist their partner's
abuse. However, the experience of an abused woman will depend on her position in the social structure. First, an overview of
resistance in abusive relationship is presented followed by a series of resistance strategies often used. The goal of this paper
is to retell the intimate partner violence story and identify structural reforms that are consistent with the experience of
intimate partner violence survivors. The response to intimate partner violence should move beyond criminal justice sanctions
by involving the community.

abusers are always males, it does not represent how the patri-
archal structure of society impacts men's use of violence
against women. For this reason, the current paper will focus
on male violence against female victims. In spite of the focus
of this paper on male to female intimate partner violence,
anyone can be a victim of intimate partner violence, regard-
less of their gender and/or sexual orientation.
Many women from shelter surveys report their partner
engages in a "campaign of terror" and does not just commit
isolated acts of violence. Johnson (1995) refers to this type of
abuse as intimate terrorism, while Stark (2007) terms it coer-
cive control, though both terms capture how patriarchy
allows abusive males maintain power and control in relation-
ships. Coercive control goes beyond an argument between
equals that escalates into a physical altercation. Coercive
control captures the immediate and the more all-encompass-
ing aspects of abusive behavior. Coercion focuses on the
present and includes physical violence and threats by the
abuser. Coercion is used so that the abused partner engages
in a particular action. Control is not limited to a single
moment in time and involves the continued deprivation and
exploitation of the woman for her abuser's benefit. Taken
together, Stark argues coercion and control interact to entrap
the woman in the abusive relationship.
Even though Johnson (1995) and Stark (2007) use differ-
ent terms, intimate terrorism and coercive control are about
the man's power and control over his intimate partner.
Though physical violence is the focus on many intimate part-
ner violence surveys (e.g., Conflict Tactic Scale), physical
violence may only be used by an abuser on rare occasions or
it might not be used at all (Bancroft, 2002; Stark, 2007).
Abusive men can engage in a wide range of controlling
behaviors, without resorting to physical violence, to main-
tain power over their partner and deprive their partner of cer-
tain freedoms. These controlling behaviors include but are
not limited to intimidation, isolation, threats, constant super-
vision, and manipulation.
Women in abusive relationships often report that their
partner's controlling behavior is worse than the actual physi-
cal abuse (Bancroft, 2002; Stark, 2007). Oftentimes, the
abuser does not have to engage in physical violence because
the woman knows not to challenge him just by the way he
looks at her (Ferraro, 2006). Controlling behaviors can have
this sort of effect on the woman because control focuses on
what her partner deprives her of as opposed to what he actu-
ally does against her when he engages in physical violence
(Stark, 2007).
The types of controlling behavior a woman experiences
can also be influenced by her race, socioeconomic status,
immigration status, and/or nationality (Bograd, 2005). For
instance, abusive men whose partner is an immigrant can use
her unfamiliarity with the United States legal system as a
control tactic, so that he is not held criminally accountable
for his abusive behavior (Ferraro, 2006). He can threaten the
woman that she will be arrested if she calls the police or that
the police will not believe her. This tactic may not be as suc-
cessful for an abusive man whose partner is familiar with the
criminal justice system or aware of mandatory arrest laws for
domestic violence. The woman's response to her partner's
abuse is shaped by the controlling behaviors he is able to
engage in against her, which can be based on her multiple
interconnected locations in the social structure. Nevertheless,
abusive men are able to engage in this constellation of behav-
iors because of the structural inequalities between genders
and other social systems in society that privilege men.
Stark (2007) expands on Johnson's (1995) concept of inti-
mate terrorism by focusing on how the patriarchal nature of
society allows abusive men to take part in these controlling
behaviors. The patriarchal nature of society gives men the
ability to monitor and control their partner's behavior
because men are the advantaged gender compared with
women (Anderson & Hill Collins, 2007; Dobash & Dobash,
2004; Stark, 2007). Women in abusive relationships may not
just have to resist physical violence; they may also have to
resist the power and control their abusive partner maintains
in the relationship.
Autonomy and Resistance in Abusive
Relationships
Stark (2007) argues that coercive control is the reaction some
men have to women's autonomy and resistance. Coercive
control gives the abuser power and subordinates the wom-
an's position. When women are not autonomous or equal
partners, men benefit because they are able to have authority
in the home. Control develops to squash the woman's auton-
omy. The woman's resistance may then be the catalyst for
her partner's control. Therefore, to identify resistance strate-
gies that are safe for the woman, one must keep in mind that
the woman's agency and resistance may fuel her abuser's
control.
Researchers have called into question the view that
women in abusive relationships are passive by highlighting
the help-seeking behaviors of these women (Gondolf &
Fisher, 1988; Hollenshead, Dai, Ragsdale, Massey, & Scott,
2006; Ingram, 2007). Gondolf and Fisher (1988) were the
first researchers to challenge the stereotypical image of pas-
sivity and learned helplessness associated with abused
women. Their survivor theory argues that women are not
passive but actively seek out help while in an abusive rela-
tionship. However, the institutions from which the woman
seeks out help oftentimes do not meet her needs. The institu-
tions that provide services are patriarchally structured and
therefore do not consider women's unique experiences
(Ferraro, 2006; Rothenberg, 2003). This makes it difficult, if
not impossible, for her to become autonomous and leave her
abuser if the institutions designed to help her do not provide
the services intended (Gondolf & Fisher, 1988).
Hayes 3
Gondolf and Fisher (1988) also directly challenge
Walker's (1979) concept of learned helplessness. By charac-
terizing women as intimate partner violence survivors, rather
than victims, Gondolf and Fisher highlight that women's
fruitless attempts to end the relationship is a misguided
approach. Instead, the survivor theory calls attention to the
ingenious ways women try to cope with escalating abuse.
Gondolf and Fisher's survivor theory laid the groundwork
for challenging Walker's cycle of violence and battered
women syndrome to realistically consider the experiences of
women in abusive relationships.
As researchers moved beyond the stereotypical view of
abused women as helpless, the nuances of intimate partner
violence became clearer. Originally, Gondolf and Fisher
(1988) focused on the help-seeking behaviors of women as
they experienced increasing violence. However, researchers
began to notice that women in abusive relationships are also
subjected to a range of controlling behaviors (Dobash &
Dobash, 2004; Johnson, 1995; Stark & Flitcraft, 1996). The
influence of these controlling behaviors on the dynamics of
intimate partner violence and the options available to women
became apparent. As the woman's abusive partner controls
multiple aspects of her life and is not just violent during iso-
lated incidents, she becomes entrapped. Therefore, research-
ers had to account for the ways in which women continue to
resist their partner's ongoing control as opposed to solely
resisting physical violence in isolated incidents.
Women in abusive relationships are able to retain a sense
of self by entering into what Stark (2007) calls safety zones,
which begin as concrete objects and move to abstract
thoughts as the abusive partner's control becomes all encom-
passing. Rajah (2007) expands on this idea of abstract safety
zones by arguing women in abusive relationships may
engage in covert resistant actions as opposed to overt actions.
Stark's abstract safety zones, which include storing away
personal objects or thinking about something else during an
abusive incident, are examples of a covert action that occurs
without the abusive partner knowing about it (Rajah, 2007).
Nevertheless, covert and overt resistance still allow the
woman to experience a sense of accomplishment. The
woman learns what covert and overt actions she can engage
in based on the history of the relationship.
Over time, many women in abusive relationships learn
what their partner does and does not like. Women often use
their partner's likes and dislikes to discern what will lead him
to engage in abusive behavior (Ferraro, 2006). In turn,
women can use this information to know how much they can
"push the envelope" (Rajah, 2007, p. 206). For example, a
woman may openly challenge her abuser's behavior when
she believes he is in a good mood. However, the woman may
be more covert about her resistance if she believes the direct
challenge will further fuel her abuser's behavior. These find-
ings show how a woman's decision to resist and if she will
overtly resist is shaped not only by her partner's behavior but
also by the relationship's history.
Similar to controlling behaviors abusers engage in, resis-
tance strategies and the resources that are available may dif-
fer depending on the women's location in the social structure
(Rajah, 2007). All of these characteristics (e.g., race, gender,
social class, immigration status, and/or sexual orientation)
are part of an integrated system of power in which one group
is at an advantage compared with another group (Anderson
& Hill Collins, 2007). In turn, the woman's position in the
social structure may determine what resistance strategies are
available to her.
For instance, the same resources that are available to
middle-class women may not be available to poor women.
Class experiences may also be shaped by race. Though a
middle-class woman who is resisting her abuser may be able
to connect with more services, if she is African American it
is possible she will continue to experience segregation and
racism in spite of her middle-class status (Anderson & Hill
Collins, 2007). The impact of class and race can be seen in
the findings of Potter (2008) and Richie (1996). Potter found
that abused African American women viewed themselves as
strong and saw their resistance as a source of empowerment.
However, Richie found that African American women felt
entrapped because of their gender, race, and social class.
Though Potter and Richie researched African American
women, Potter's sample was a mixture of working and
middle-class women who were not incarcerated while
Richie's sample was mostly poor African American incarcer-
ated women. The different findings between women of the
same race highlight that factors beyond race can impact the
resistance strategies available to certain women, such as
social class and/or prior criminal record.
For women of ethnic minorities, Sokoloff (2008) argues
that Western cultures tend to concentrate on what the Western
cultures believe are the negative aspects of an ethnicity. Yet,
Yoshioka and Choi (2005) argue that we should look into the
woman's culture for ways to respond to intimate partner vio-
lence. Many strengths of certain cultures are overlooked
when in fact these strengths can be used by women as a resis-
tance strategy (Sokoloff, 2008). As will be discussed, small
cultural communities may be able to use shaming as a way to
hold the abuser accountable. Though certain aspects of a cul-
ture may be a viable resistance strategy for some women, it
may be unavailable because of how the advantaged ethnicity
or race has constructed a particular race or ethnicity.
Therefore, to understand the resistance strategies avail-
able to a woman, one must consider the intersectionality
between race, class, gender, and/or ethnicity. It is important
to remember that these four characteristics are not the only
attributes of the woman that impact her experience. For
instance, the woman's sexual orientation or religion may also
play a role. As one considers the resistance strategies avail-
able to a woman, it is important to keep in mind the systems
of power that influence the options available to her.
Nonetheless, every woman will have her own resistance
strategies based on the controlling behaviors her partner does
4 SAGE Open
and does not engage in. Depending on the degrees of threat
of physical violence in the relationship, some women may
have lower thresholds in which they achieve a sense of
accomplishment (Rajah, 2007). Though strategies may differ
depending on her partner's abuse or her location in the social
structure, the end goal of every strategy remains the same.
A woman's resistance of an abusive partner is meant to pro-
vide her with a sense of autonomy, or accomplishment, in
hopes of changing, or even leaving, the relationship. While,
Rajah (2007) and Stark (2007) identify why women may
engage in these resistance strategies, Abraham (2005) pro-
vides a framework for identifying the different strategies of
resistance.
Resistance Strategies
Abraham (2005) argues, similar to Gondolf and Fisher
(1988), women engage in certain behaviors throughout abu-
sive relationships to show they are not passive and/or help-
less. While some of these behaviors may seem obvious, the
identification and availability of resistance strategies will
depend on the abuser's level of control, the women's indi-
vidual characteristics and her position in the social structure.
One of the personal strategies to resist an abusive partner is
hitting back (Abraham, 2005). However, hitting back can be
very dangerous because it is an overt form of resistance
(Abraham, 2005; Rajah, 2007). Moreover, the abusive male
may be able to physically overpower the woman when she
physically resists. Nevertheless, some women still engage in
physical resistance, which challenges the notion of passivity
in intimate partner violence victims.
Women in abusive relationships may physically resist for
a multitude of reasons and it is therefore important to con-
sider the underlying motivation. Johnson (2006) expanded
his framework to consider the context in which men and
women use violence in relationships. Violent resistance is
when the woman is physically violent but not controlling. A
woman may engage in violence, but it is usually in response
to her abusive partner's intimate terrorism (Johnson, 2006).
According to Johnson (2006) in a very small number of
cases, called mutual violent control, both the man and woman
are violent and controlling. Therefore, when a woman
engages in physical resistance one must not only look at who
the aggressor is, but also consider who has the power and
control in the relationship. The woman's violent resistance
may be a response to her partner's coercive control or it may
be a part of her own violent and controlling behavior against
her partner.
Another resistance strategy is when a woman contem-
plates and/or attempts suicide. The woman may believe that
death is the only way she can escape the abuse (Abraham,
2005). Ferraro (2006) also found that many women consider
suicide as a way to stop the abuse before they murder their
abusive partner. Abraham (2005) argues suicide ideation
by abused women represents the extreme isolation and
depression they experience. The ideation also highlights the
loss of hope many women in abusive relationships undergo.
Suicide may be the only form of resistance the woman is able
to engage in because her partner controls everything else.
The only aspect of her life she may be able to control is
whether to take her own life or not.
In line with Gondolf and Fisher (1988), Abraham (2005)
identifies accessing formal and/or informal help as forms of
resistance. These are outward resistance strategies because
the woman goes outside the relationship to assert her refusal
to accept her abuser's behavior. Family and friends, both
informal sources of help, can then express their disapproval
of the abuser's behavior. When family and friends intervene
on the woman's behalf, it is meant to show she has options
outside of the relationship (Abraham, 2005). Nevertheless, it
is important to keep in mind the abuser may use family and/
or friends to further manipulate and control the woman,
thereby limiting the help an abused woman can receive
(Hayes, 2012).
Again, culture, race, religion, and ethnicity must be con-
sidered because these social structures may influence the
informal sources of help available to the woman. Cultural or
religious communities can play an important role by sham-
ing the abusive male (Sokoloff, 2008). When the woman
notifies and involves the community, the community can
begin to hold him accountable. The batterer must change his
abusive ways to be accepted back into the community, a pro-
cess Braithwaite (1989) refers to as reintegrative shaming.
This may be more effective than imprisoning the abuser
because reintegrative shaming has those who are important
to the abuser holding him accountable. When family and
friends become aware of the abuse, they can challenge his
abusive mentality while a period of incarceration may not
allow for this ongoing process of accountability. If the family
and/or friends are being used to further the abuse, the process
of reintegration is then not available, further shaping the
resistance strategies available to the woman.
The criminal justice system encompasses formal sources
of help, such as the police and courts. Though there are man-
datory arrest laws for domestic violence and no-drop prose-
cution that can be life-saving, formal sources of help can
create impediments to women's resistance strategies
(Menjivar & Salcido, 2002). The problematic response of the
criminal justice system to intimate partner violence has been
documented and includes women's arrest for intimate part-
ner violence, failure to arrest the male abuser, dual arrest,
lack of response from the police or the woman's own depor-
tation (Bui, 2004; Buzawa & Buzawa, 2003; Incite!, 2005).
Many of the South Asian women in Abraham's (2005) study
did not contact the police for help because of the possible
repercussions of involving the criminal justice system, like
her own arrest or deportation if she is an immigrant. The
woman's fear can stem from a number of reasons such as her
abuser's lies about the criminal justice system, her unfamil-
iarity with the system or her immigration status (Bui, 2004;
Hayes 5
Ferraro, 2006; Sokoloff, 2008). Therefore, the formal strate-
gies (e.g., mandatory arrest, no-drop prosecution) that are
promoted and relied on so heavily may be one of the least
likely ways a woman tries to resist her abusive partner.
It is not just immigrant women who are hesitant to involve
the criminal justice system when they experience intimate
partner violence. Individuals of different races, ethnicities,
sexual orientations, or classes who experience violence in
relationships, but who also diverge from the White middle-
class stereotypical abused woman, may have a difficult time
resisting their abuser through formal sources (Bograd, 2005).
Formal sources of help may deem these individuals unwor-
thy of services or deny that intimate partner violence occurs
in these populations (Dasgupta, 2005). Moreover, African
Americans and minority groups are critical of formal sources
of help because of the institutional racism within the criminal
justice system. Institutional racism is seen as a component of
the structure of society in which the institution is designed to
advantage some groups over others (Anderson & Hill
Collins, 2007). In the criminal justice system, White indi-
viduals are advantaged over minorities. Many abused women
of color may not want to involve the criminal justice system,
if they are involved in the movement against institutional
racism.
Furthermore, the incident-based focus of the criminal jus-
tice system is misleading in cases of intimate partner vio-
lence. The focus on incidents classifies individuals as either
an offender or a victim without understanding the power and
control in the relationship or the social structural forces that
perpetuate intimate partner violence (Ferraro, 2006).
Understanding that a woman's violent assault may be the
result of the culmination of an abuser's threats, intimida-
tions, and physical abuse presents a different picture from a
fight between two equals that erupts into a physical alterca-
tion (Johnson, 2006). Formal sources of help that focus on
incidents do not capture the complexity of intimate partner
violence. Moving beyond isolated incidents may also allow
for the consideration of how multiple oppressions can impact
the woman. It is only by considering the ongoing nature of
control and how the social structure affects intimate partner
violence that one can understand how a woman resists over
the course of a relationship.
Resistance Strategies for Safety and
Separation
Some women may not be able to separate from their abuser
for a multitude of reasons. She may be financially dependent
on her abuser or they may have children in common. For
some women, the end goal may be safety, not separation
(Yoshioka & Choi, 2005). Therefore, the resistance strategies
she is able to engage in will be influenced by if she is able to
leave her abusive partner. Though the resistance strategies a
woman engages in throughout the relationship in the name of
safety are important, there is another point in the relationship
in which the woman's resistance plays a vital role.
Resistant acts can prepare the woman to separate from her
partner or be used by the woman as she begins to end the
relationship. Separation, which encompasses when the
woman wants to end, is ending, and when she finally ends
the relationship, can be conceptualized as more of a process
than an event (DeKeseredy & Schwartz, 2009). When one
conceptualizes separation as a continuum as opposed to a
single moment in time, there are important implications for
the experiences of intimate partner violence survivors. A
continuum of separation expands the resistance strategies a
woman can engage in. It acknowledges the multiple points in
time when the woman asserts her independence and resists
her abusive partner as opposed to the incident-based model
of the criminal justice system. A separation continuum more
accurately represents the experience of intimate partner vio-
lence survivors.
As the couple separates, the woman may engage in a
range of autonomous behaviors that directly challenge her
partner's control. Some of these behaviors include finding a
home, getting a job, filing for custody of the children or
obtaining a restraining order against her abuser. Each of
these behaviors may go against one part of the woman's life
the man has control over. They also will not occur at the
exact same moment in time but will occur through a process
of establishing independence. By viewing separation as a
continuum, one can see the ongoing nature of separation.
It is clear that separation is an important juncture in abu-
sive relationships. However, separation is a dangerous time
for abused women and their children because they are at an
increased risk of violence and femicide (Fleury, Sullivan, &
Bybee, 2000; O'Sullivan, 2002; Stark, 2007). Because sepa-
ration is a challenge to an abuser's control, he may increase
his abusive behaviors to regain the control he is losing over
his partner's behavior (Bancroft, 2002; Campbell, Glass,
Sharps, Laughon, & Bloom, 2007). As the woman resists and
continues to assert her autonomy through the process of sep-
aration, each resistant act can increase the possibility of
retaliatory violence by her abuser. It is always important to
keep in mind the potential dangers associated with resistance
strategies and how these dangers may be escalated during the
process of separation. Nonetheless, it is this process of sepa-
ration that is critical when reframing and retelling the story
of intimate partner violence.
How to Retell the Intimate Partner
Violence Story
How should the stories of intimate partner violence survivors
be told so that they more accurately reflect the experience of
women? Many scholars argue that we need to reconceptual-
ize intimate partner violence to include an increased focus on
controlling behaviors and move beyond isolated acts of
6 SAGE Open
physical violence (Johnson, 1995; Polletta, 2009; Stark,
2007). Yet, reconceptualizing intimate partner violence theo-
retically in academia will not bring about the lasting changes
that impact intimate partner violence survivors. Public policy
changes need to be introduced to make survivors' lives safer.
The issue must be moved onto the policy agenda, with stories
being just one way to do so (Stone, 2002). By retelling the
story from the women's perspectives of strength and auton-
omy over the course of time, the story of intimate partner
violence that incorporates coercive control can get on the
policy agenda.
Polletta (2009) argues the story associated with Walker's
(1979) battered women syndrome and the one that dominates
the intimate partner violence field today is one of tragedy. It
does not present the woman as a survivor, but as someone
who kills her abuser when victimization has taken over her
rationality (Polletta, 2009). In contrast, Polletta (2009)
argues for the rebirth story, in which the woman has a
moment when she realizes that she wants to live. The deci-
sion to live leads the woman to engage in resistance strate-
gies that begin to challenge her abuser's control and/or
violence. Researchers have identified the occurrence of this
moment for intimate partner violence victims and such
events have been given attention in the crisis intervention
literature (Campbell, Rose, Kub, & Nedd, 1998; Eisikovits,
Buchbinder, & Mor, 1998; Granvold, 2005; Roberts, 2005).
By changing the story associated with intimate partner vio-
lence from one of tragedy to one of rebirth, the focus shifts to
what the woman does to assert her autonomy and resist her
abuser.
Polletta's (2009) version of the rebirth story focuses on a
singlemomentintime.SimilartoDeKeseredyandSchwartz's
(2009) separation definition, it may be more appropriate for
the rebirth story to incorporate the process of separation and
change rather than focusing solely on an event. As noted,
separating from an abusive partner occurs over a period of
time and usually does not happen overnight. By highlighting
the moment the woman decides she wants to live without
fear and/or leave and exploring the process that ensues, the
dynamics of the abusive relationship become apparent. One
will be able to see how the woman's abusive partner contin-
ues to be controlling on separation and how she resists this
behavior to assert her autonomy.
For instance, on separation, an abuser may begin to use
the children or family members as tools to control the woman
(Bancroft, 2002; Bancroft & Silverman, 2002; DeKeseredy
& Schwartz, 2009; Hayes, 2012; Stark, 2007). As the father
begins using family and friends to manipulate the woman,
she will have to continue to challenge his control though they
are no longer romantically involved. Throughout this process
the woman is asserting her autonomy, which is the basis of
the rebirth story. By expanding the rebirth story from a
moment to a process, one is able to see how an abusive part-
ner can continue to control the woman once she decides she
wants to live a life without abuse.
The rebirth story has implications for women who use
violence in intimate relationships. Instead of focusing on the
violent incident, the rebirth story emphasizes the woman's
struggle against her partner's control. Polletta (2009) points
out that by focusing on the woman's decision to live in a
single moment, the audience is able to identify with her. By
having the audience identify with the woman, it is hoped that
she will not be viewed as a violent aggressor even if she
resorts to physical violence as a way to resist her abuser.
Instead, the audience's identification with the woman is
meant to have them sympathize with her choices and recog-
nize how her options were constrained because of the part-
ner's continued control during the process of separation.
Though there is the possibility that some outsiders will iden-
tify the woman as a violent aggressor if she engages in physi-
cal violence, the rebirth story's focus on rationality is
designed to have outsiders identify with the woman's limited
options.
Strategies for Change Beyond Retelling
the Intimate Partner Violence Story
Nevertheless, the rebirth story does not fully capture the
dynamics of intimate partner violence. By focusing on a sin-
gle woman and how she escapes an abusive relationship, the
rebirth story suggests it is up to the woman to escape the
abusive relationship (Stark, 2009). Therefore, the story of
strength and resistance needs to incorporate the societal
structures that reinforce patriarchal norms and perpetuate
intimate partner violence, moving toward an ecological
model that considers how factors at different levels interact
(Carlson, 1984; Lischick, 2007).
The experience of intimate partner violence is not the
same for every survivor (Bograd, 2005). The rebirth story
needs to take into account the multiple forms of oppression
many intimate partner violence survivors experience. When
the woman is a part of disadvantaged group(s), advantaged
groups may not believe or identify with her rebirth story.
This has already occurred with the battered women syn-
drome, which created a separation between advantaged and
disadvantaged women. The battered women syndrome rein-
forces notions of unrealistic passivity typically associated
with White middle-class women (Rothenberg, 2003).
Women who depart from this ideal of passivity are less
likely to successfully use the battered women's syndrome
during a trial. Thus, the battered women syndrome's focus
on White middle-class disadvantaged women who were not
seen as conforming to notions of passivity and helplessness
(Allard, 2005; Ferraro, 2003). The rebirth story must then
incorporate other oppressions in the woman's life that can
affect her experience. For example, if the woman is African
American, she may have to overcome obstacles associated
with her race. It may be further complicated if she lives in
poverty, which often overlaps with race (Sudbury, 2004).
All of these oppressions intersect so that the woman does
Hayes 7
not experience gender oppression in isolation from these
other oppressions.
Though the rebirth story focuses on an individual woman,
it is important to consider how structural forces impact the
woman's experience and the options available to her
(Carlson, 1984; Lischick, 2007). Structural reforms must
also occur so that the focus is not just on changing the indi-
vidual (Sokoloff, 2008). For instance, it has been argued that
the increase in women's poverty is partly due to globaliza-
tion (Sudbury, 2004). One must consider the larger picture of
how globalization has moved jobs outside of the United
States, making it more difficult for women to have enough
money to sustain a family on their own. While changing the
story associated with intimate partner violence is important,
it will not provide women with jobs they need to support
their children if they leave their abuser. The rebirth story can
bring to light the social structural changes needed to improve
options for women attempting to end an abusive relationship
by showing how individual women struggle. The story can
then argue that society must provide practical options to
assist women who are trying to end abusive relationships and
assert autonomy.
Community accountability, or community-based responses,
should be incorporated in the rebirth story as a way to end
violence against women. The model involves not only the
government and criminal justice system, but also clergy,
social service providers, media, and employers (National
Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence, n.d.). It may be a
viable response to intimate partner violence, especially for
those groups that do not want to rely solely on the criminal
justice system. Instead of focusing on criminalization and
incarceration, the community accountability model has com-
munities work together to tackle the structural forces that
perpetuate intimate partner violence and entrap women in
abusive relationships (Incite!, 2005).
Violence against women does not occur in a vacuum, but
occurs in the context of a socially structured system of poli-
tics, class, race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. To combat
violence against women, Smith (2005) argues strategies
must be directed at not only gender inequality but also rac-
ism, class oppression, and the overreliance on prisons. If we
only address intimate partner violence without considering
the institutional racism in the criminal justice system, many
people will not get the help they need. Intimate partner vio-
lence survivors' lack of faith in the criminal justice system
further highlights that the movement must move beyond
criminalization. It is not to say that the criminalization of
intimate partner violence and state policies have not saved
the lives of women. They have, but there are also many
women who have suffered the adverse effects of these
policies.
If one considers the multiple oppressions women face, it
becomes evident that the resources available (e.g., domestic
violence services, formal sources of help) are not appropriate
for some women (Smith, 2005). Smith (2005) argues that the
answer is not to make these programs culturally competent
but to have actual women who have experienced intimate
partner violence to be a part of the movement to "end (italics
in original) violence against women of color" (p. 418). The
movement to combat intimate partner violence should also
work in tandem with the movement to end state violence
(Smith, 2005).
How can a movement possibly address both intimate part-
ner violence and state violence? Smith (2005) offers an array
of strategies, but notes that advocates should focus on ending
violence against women, not providing programs. Though
culturally competent programs are an important part of ser-
vices, services address the violence once it has already
occurred (Sokoloff, 2008). Again, it is vital that the move-
ment addresses the structural conditions, such as patriarchal
institutions and the capitalist economy, that perpetuate vio-
lence against women and entrap women in abusive relation-
ships (Ferraro, 2006). This is because intimate partner
violence is not a single issue but a part of larger issues affect-
ing the community (Sokoloff, 2008).
Moreover, the criminalization of intimate partner vio-
lence diverts community's attention away from creating
ways to respond to the violence that occurs in the community
(Incite!, 2005). "Tough on crime" policies do not allow for
the development of community responses that could effec-
tively hold abusive men accountable. Instead, "tough on
crime" policies focus on the retributive aspect of punishment
as opposed to the rehabilitation aspect. Community account-
ability models and the rebirth story can begin to question
patriarchal norms that are also deconstructed in batterer
intervention programs (Bancroft, 2002). Community-based
programs should not only involve the criminal justice sys-
tem, but should involve men holding abusive men in the
community accountable (DeKeseredy & Schwartz, 2009;
Douglas, Bathrick, & Perry, 2008; Incite!, 2005).
Opportunity theory, and the policy implications associ-
ated with it, has been applied to a number of criminal justice
problems (Clarke, 1997). Yet, it has not been systematically
applied to intimate partner violence research, though the iso-
lation process fits within the routine activity framework,
where the offender converges in space and time with suitable
target in the absence of a capable guardian (Cohen & Felson,
1979; Lanier & Maume, 2009; Stark, 2007). Isolating the
victim decreases risk to the offender by limiting capable
guardianship and surveillance (Clarke, 1997). Creating prac-
tical solutions that increase risk and decrease rewards by
implementing guardianship may be a starting point for
designing effective intimate partner violence policies.
Another way to reframe intimate partner violence, as part
of the rebirth story, is by challenging some of the commonly
used words in the field. Many women who are abused by
their partner do not want to be labeled or do not see them-
selves as a battered women or victim (Ferraro, 2006). In line
with Gondolf and Fisher (1988), it would be better to find
more appropriate terms, like survivors. The term survivor
8 SAGE Open
more accurately represents their experience and does not
have the negative connotations associated with the "passive
victim."
Individuals working with intimate partner violence survi-
vors must adopt new terminologies. Smith (2005) calls atten-
tion to the fact many individuals who work in domestic
violence programs see the women as "clients." Advocates
and service providers should see these women not only as
survivors, but also as potential activists and organizers
(Incite!, 2005; Smith, 2005). By returning to the grassroots
nature of the domestic violence movement, Incite! (2005)
argues social justice movements will be able to work together
to develop communities. By developing communities, we
can move from an individualized approach to combating
intimate partner violence to one in which men are held
accountable by the community (DeKeseredy & Schwartz,
2009; Douglas et al., 2008).
Presently used terms, like domestic violence and physical
abuse, may not reflect the lived experience of many intimate
partner violence survivors whose partner is controlling. In
addition, separation abuse can be a large part of the woman's
experience long after the couple is no longer together.
Therefore, the term domestic violence is misleading in these
circumstances because the couple is no longer cohabitating.
Domestic violence can also refer to violence between indi-
viduals who live in the same household, such as brothers and
sisters or parents and children. Intimate partner violence may
be a more appropriate term to use to reflect violence that
occurs between intimates, either during a relationship or
after the couple has separated.
Conclusion
Women in abusive relationships resist their batterer in a
number of ways. However, the story associated with intimate
partner violence is one that often depicts the woman as a pas-
sive and helpless victim. By retelling the story in a way that
highlights women's resistance and strength, changes can be
made in the response to intimate partner violence. By depict-
ing the rebirth story as a process in which the woman asserts
her autonomy as her partner continues to control her, it is
hoped she will no longer be seen as a woman seeking
revenge. Instead, her partner's control comes to the forefront
and the woman's resistance to his behavior is highlighted.
The rebirth story will not be enough though and there is a
need to reform the social structures that oppress women.
Women do not solely experience gender inequality. The
oppression women experience because of their gender inter-
sects with various other systems of oppression. It is crucial
that the intimate partner violence rebirth story accurately
reflects the lived experiences of women and call attention to
the structural and cultural constraints of women in abusive
relationships.

Author Biography
Brittany E. Hayes is a PhD student in the Criminal Justice Program
at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the Graduate Center, City
University of New York. Her research focuses on intimate partner
violence, specifically controlling behavior that involves third par-
ties during the process of separation. She also studies the impact of
macro and micro level factors on deviant attitudes and behaviors.
