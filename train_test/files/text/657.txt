Physical Activity and Its Correlates Among Urban
Primary Care Patients Aged 55 Years or Older
Daniel O. Clark
Indiana University Center for Aging Research and Regenstrief Institute for Health Care, Indianapolis.
Objectives. Physical inactivity is a leading cause of death and disability, but very little is known about physical ac-
tivity and its determinants among socially disadvantaged and medically vulnerable adults. The purpose of this study
was to assess physical activity and its correlates, including measures of physical activity knowledge, perceived barri-
ers, and self-efficacy, among socioeconomically disadvantaged older adults.
Methods. A stratified random sample of 1,088 patients aged 55 years or older was selected from an urban primary care
center serving a predominantly low-income population. Of the 1,088 patients sampled, 771 (71%) completed an inter-
viewer-administered questionnaire.
Results. A physical activity instrument, developed specifically for the population being studied, showed an average
of 65 minutes of physical activity per week. Scores on a true-false knowledge quiz were no better than expected by
chance, and over two thirds reported symptom and perceived environmental barriers to physical activity. Lower self-
efficacy and greater symptom and motivational barriers were found to be associated with less physical activity.
Discussion. Given the prevalence of inactivity, knowledge deficits, and perceived barriers to physical activity,
population-specific interventions may be required to improve rates of physical activity among socially disadvantaged
and medically vulnerable adults.
IT has been estimated that more than 250,000 adults die
each year as a result of physical inactivity (Powell &
Blair, 1994). Consequently, physical inactivity is one of the
leading causes of death among adults in the United States
(McGinnis & Foege, 1993). Physical inactivity is a leading
cause of both death and disability among older adults
(Buchner, 1997), and physical activity or exercise has been
the most common intervention for the prevention or man-
agement of disability (Jette et al., 1996; King, Haskell,
Taylor, Kraemer, & DeBusk, 1991).
Health care provider referral and counseling for physical
activity is highly recommended (U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force, 1996), but older adults' compliance with physi-
cal activity recommendations is low (Shah, Maly, Frank,
Hirsch, & Reuben, 1997) and perceived barriers to greater
compliance may be significant (Clark, in press). To effec-
tively promote physical activity among all adults, we will
need to develop measures and improve understanding of
physical activity and its determinants within vulnerable
populations (Fletcher et al., 1996; NIH Consensus Devel-
opment Panel, 1996; Pate et al., 1995; Premen, 1996). To
date, adults with lower education, little income, and poor
health have rarely been included in physical activity stud-
ies. Yet, these are the persons suffering the most in terms of
chronic disease and impairment (Clark, Mungai, Stump, &
Wolinsky, 1997).
Theoretical models suggest that adequate physical activity
knowledge and self-efficacy, and recognition and successful
management of perceived barriers all affect the likelihood of
adoption and maintenance of regular physical activity (An-
dersen, Blair, Cheskin, & Bartlett, 1997; Clark, 1995; Mar-
cus & Owen, 1992; McAuley, Lox, & Duncan, 1993; Sallis,
Hovell, & Hofstetter, 1992). Self-efficacy is a pivotal con-
cept of social cognitive theory and represents the evaluations
people make of their performance ability in a particular do-
main and the likely outcomes of that performance (Bandura,
1986). Outcome expectations fall under the model of self-
efficacy and represent evaluations people make of the out-
comes that will result from the behavior. The information
persons draw on to assess their performance ability and
likely outcomes may be based on previous experiences, ob-
servation of others, or verbal persuasion (Strecher, McEvoy,
Becker, & Rosenstock, 1986). In addition, an individual's in-
formation or knowledge base may operate in conjunction
with perceived social and physical resources or barriers to
affect self-efficacy assessments and, ultimately, behavior
(Rosenstock, Strecher, & Becker, 1988).
The Regenstrief Physical Activity and Health Survey
(RPAHS) was designed to assess physical activity knowl-
edge, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and behavior among
a vulnerable population of older adults. Data on physical ac-
tivity behavior and its correlates were gathered from per-
sons aged 55 years or older who receive care from an urban
primary care center that serves a predominantly low-income
population. After assessing the appropriateness of two exist-
ing physical activity instruments, this article presents the
measures developed specifically for the RPAHS sample.
Because gender and age differences in social norms and
health are likely to affect physical activity behavior, self-
efficacy, knowledge, and perceived barriers, all physical ac-
S41

tivity measures are explored by age and gender. Finally, a
multivariable, hierarchical model of the association between
physical activity and theoretically relevant blocks of inde-
pendent variables is estimated. In the hierarchical model, so-
ciodemographic characteristics are followed by measures of
knowledge and perceived barriers (including current health
status), which are followed by self-efficacy measures.
METHODS
The RPAHS consisted of a survey development phase,
which included the conduct of focus groups, and a survey ad-
ministration phase. Accordingly, the methods of the study are
presented in two parts. First, the focus group sample selection
and script are presented, and then the survey sample selection
and instruments are presented. The presentation of analyses
addresses the procedures used in the evaluation of the focus
group data, the psychometric testing of the survey instru-
ments, and the cross-sectional analyses of the survey data.
Focus Group Sample
Details of the focus group sample selection, script, and
results are published elsewhere (Clark, in press). Names
were randomly selected from the Regenstrief Medical
Records System (RMRS), which contains data on all pa-
tients seen at any of seven primary care centers located
around Indianapolis (McDonald, Tierney, Overhage, Mar-
tin, & Wilson, 1992). Individuals were phoned until 8 to 10
persons in each of four race by gender groups had agreed to
attend a focus group session. Generally, it was necessary to
phone 20 individuals from each group to arrive at 8 to 10
individuals who attended the session. The exception to this
rule was White men. Eight White men agreed to attend, but
just 3 individuals showed up for the session.
The script was the same at each of the four sessions. The
script began by asking participants to list some physical ac-
tivities that come to mind. Examples were given as a probe
when necessary. After a list was compiled and additional
activities were not forthcoming, participants were asked
which activities they perform most often, and how often
they perform these activities. The participants were then
asked to name activities that come to mind when they hear
the term exercise.
With an exercise list completed, participants were told to
imagine they were required to exercise at least 3 times a
week for 30 minutes each session. They were then asked to
choose one exercise activity to meet this requirement. Each
participant was then asked what led them to choose that
particular activity. They were then asked to consider the
factors that would make it difficult for them to perform the
activity or, alternatively, factors that would make it easier
for them to perform the activity.
Survey Sample
Respondents to the RPAHS came from a stratified ran-
dom sample that was taken from the RMRS. Community-
dwelling patients who had at least one scheduled visit to the
Wishard Memorial Hospital outpatient general medicine
practice in the 12 months preceding the list generation, had
a valid address or phone number, and who were at least 55
years of age were eligible. There were approximately 5,000
eligible subjects. The sample list was stratified by age (55
to 69 and 70 and older), gender, and race (African Ameri-
can, White). One hundred forty patients were randomly se-
lected from each of the 8 possible strata, except the older
White male strata. There were only 108 White men in the
70 and older age group; all of these men were selected.
Thus, a total of 1,088 patients were selected.
The 1,088 sampled patients were approached over an 8-
month period as they came in to the clinic for scheduled ap-
pointments. A face-to-face interview was conducted in the
clinic, or a time for a telephone interview was arranged. Pa-
tients who did not have a scheduled appointment during the
8-month period received a telephone interview without ini-
tial contact in the clinic. The Short Portable Mental Status
Questionnaire (Pfeiffer, 1975) was used to screen patients
for cognitive impairment.
We were unable to establish contact with 174 (16%) pa-
tients and another 115 (10%) patients refused. Fifteen patients
failed the cognitive screen or had a speech or hearing impair-
ment with no proxy available, and 13 patients did not com-
plete the interview. Thus, 771 (71%) completed a face-to-face
or phone interview. Twenty-nine percent of these interviews
were in person and the remaining interviews were over the
phone. There were 42 (5%) proxy interviews. The data from
proxy interviews have been excluded from Tables 3 and 4,
which included responses to questions about physical activity
self-efficacy, knowledge, and perceived barriers.
Bivariate analyses comparing those interviewed (n = 111)
to those not interviewed (n = 317) on each of the variables
shown in Table 1 indicated that men were less likely to be in-
terviewed than women (p < .05). The response rate among
women was 82% (n = 458), but 59% among men (n = 313).
Men were less likely to have an operating telephone and were
less likely to show up for scheduled clinic appointments.
Table 1 presents a comparison of selected characteristics
of the RPAHS sample to the 1995 Current Population Survey
(CPS) respondents who were 55 years of age or older and to
respondents of the 1984 National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) Supplement on Aging, all of whom were 55 years of
age or older. As can be seen, the respondents to the RPAHS
were significantly poorer, less educated, and of poorer health.
Survey Measures
The survey generally lasted about 20 minutes. One
African American woman and one White woman inter-
viewed patients over an 8-month period (November 1996
through June 1997) for the baseline survey. Formal inter-
rater reliability was considered too burdensome for respon-
dents, but no statistically significant differences across inter-
viewers were found on any measure. To organize the
discussion of measures, we have grouped them into four
theoretically derived categories: (1) sociodemographic char-
acteristics; (2) knowledge and perceived barriers (including
health and chronic disease); (3) self-efficacy; and (4) physi-
cal activity.
Sociodemographic characteristics.--Sociodemographic
measures were relatively standard and included age, race,
gender, and years of formal education. To asses income, re-
spondents were asked whether their household income was

Knowledge and perceived barriers.--The physical activ-
ity knowledge and perceived barriers questions were devel-
oped specifically for this survey and population. Knowl-
edge was measured with a 6-item facts-on-exercise quiz.
Responses were agree, disagree, and not sure. Scores are
reported as the number correct out of six. The six quiz
statements were "as people get older they should exercise
less," "if you can talk while exercising, you aren't exercis-
ing hard enough," "regular exercise can make you feel less
tired," "people with high blood pressure should not exer-
cise," "a slow walk is as good as a brisk walk," and "your
heart does not have to beat faster than normal for exercise
to make your heart and lungs stronger."
To determine perceived barriers to physical activity, we
asked respondents, "Do any of the following reasons keep
you from walking or exercising more than you currently
do?" We then presented a list of potential barriers identified
through focus groups and an open-ended question during
survey pilot testing. Respondents answered yes or no to the
following potential barriers: fear of crime, poor weather, no
or poor sidewalks, getting out and having no place to sit
down, not enough will power, lack of interest, not enough
time, pain, swelling, fear of chest pain, no energy, and fear
of shortness of breath.
In addition to symptoms reported as specific barriers to
physical activity, general health and chronic disease indica-
tors may represent perceived barriers or resources for phys-
ical activity. Chronic disease indicators were based on the
RMRS data, whereas general health status questions were
incorporated into the survey. Persons were determined to
have a particular disease if it had been diagnosed, marked
on the patient problem list, or treated through prescribed
medications. Hypertension was additionally determined to
exist if persons had systolic values of greater than 140 or
diastolic values of greater than 90. The survey included a
question of perceived health, and questions about mobility.
Perceived health was measured with a 5-point response set
(excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor), but recoded to
fair or poor versus all other for analyses. Like the perceived
health question, the mobility questions have been fre-
quently used in nationally representative surveys of older
adults and shown to perform adequately (Guralnik et al.,
1993). There were two items; one asked about difficulty
walking one block and the other asked about difficulty
climbing one flight of stairs. Responses were no difficulty, a
little, somewhat, or very difficult, and unable to do because
of a health or disability problem.
Self-efficacy.--Self-efficacy consists of two components;
efficacy expectations and outcome expectations. There were
three questions to determine efficacy expectations (i.e., per-
formance confidence) and three to determine outcome ex-
pectations (i.e., outcome confidence). The efficacy expecta-
tions questions were each framed in the same way, but the
referenced activity varied in type and/or frequency. Re-
sponse categories were not at all sure, a little sure, some-
what sure, and very sure, and were scored 0, 1,2, and 3, re-
spectively. Thus, the range for the efficacy and outcome
expectations scores was 0 (not at all sure) to 9 (very sure).
An example of an efficacy expectations item is "how sure
are you that you could sit in a chair and exercise your arms
and legs for 20 minutes at least 3 times a week." The other
two questions asked about brisk walking for 10 minutes
every day of the week and brisk walking for 30 minutes 3
times a week. The outcome expectations questions fol-
lowed immediately after each efficacy expectations ques-
tion and asked subjects how sure they were that the previ-
ously described activity and frequency (e.g., 10 minutes of
brisk walking every day) would improve their health. Re-
sponse categories were the same as those for the efficacy
expectations questions. These activities and frequencies
were chosen in an attempt to represent a range of physical
activity difficulty and frequency relevant to this population.
Approximately 9% of respondents were unable to charac-
terize their level of self-efficacy on at least one outcome or
S44 CLARK
efficacy expectations item. These persons were coded as "a
little sure" for the multivariable models (Table 4). Those
models were run with and without these imputed cases, and
the results of those models did not differ significantly from
what is presented in Table 4.
Physical activity.--Exercise has been defined as a subset
of physical activities that are planned, structured, and repet-
itive for the purpose of physical fitness, whereas physical
activity is more broadly defined as bodily movement of
skeletal muscles (NIH Consensus Development Panel,
1996). Focus groups indicated that many respondents
would be very broad in their classification of physical ac-
tivity, often expanding it to include all activity, physical or
not. Thus, activities were specifically identified for the re-
spondents on the survey.
In the assessment of physical activity, patients were
asked whether they ever climb stairs and, if so, how many
flights of stairs they climb on a normal day. Respondents
were also asked whether they ever walk as far as one block
and, if so, how often they took such walks during a normal
week and how many minutes a normal walk lasted. They
were also asked whether their legs got tired, their hearts
beat faster, or their breathing got heavier on a normal walk.
Respondents were also asked whether they did any phys-
ical activities other than walking that were exertional (i.e.,
causing their legs to get tired, their heart to beat faster or
their breathing to get heavier). If they responded yes, they
were asked how often they engaged in such activity and
how long the activity normally lasted. The dependent vari-
able for the multivariate analyses was minutes of physical
activity per week. Total minutes of walking, whether exer-
tional, and total minutes of other exertional activity were
combined to arrive at a single measure of total minutes of
physical activity per week. It is important to note that stair
climbing was not included in the composition of total min-
utes of physical activity.
Analyses
In what follows, we present the results of the focus group
sessions, the psychometric properties of the new survey
measures, and the results of cross-sectional analyses of the
survey data. Each focus group session was audiotaped and a
research assistant took notes during the session. The facilita-
tor then listened to the audiotape and wrote out a transcript.
The transcript was reviewed and compared to transcripts of
other sessions. All sessions followed the same script, and a
table of responses following the script was generated to
compare the responses across groups (see Clark, in press).
The assessment of psychometric characteristics consisted of
exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency, and test-
retest reliability. Exploratory factor analysis was performed
on the self-efficacy and outcome expectations items, which
were expected to form two dimensions, and with perceived
barriers to physical activity to identify clustering. Internal
consistency of the two self-efficacy dimensions was as-
sessed using Cronbach's alpha. Test-retest reliability was
performed for the physical activity measures on 50 subjects.
Results were assessed using the intraclass correlation coeffi-
cient (Streiner & Norman, 1995).
Following the presentation of focus group and psychomet-
ric results, physical activity behavior and physical activity
self-efficacy, knowledge, and perceived barriers are pre-
sented for the sample as a whole, two age groups (i.e., ages
55 to 69 and 70 and older), and men and women. We explore
age and gender differences using t tests. We then estimate
correlates of minutes of physical activity per week. Total
minutes of physical activity per week was highly skewed and
was recoded into four categories for the multivariable, hier-
archical analysis. Ordinary least squares regression was used
because assumptions were satisfied with minutes categorized
as described previously, and the percent of variance associ-
ated with each of three separate blocks of variables could be
determined. The potential correlates of minutes of physical
activity per week were incorporated sequentially in three
blocks following the model presented earlier; (1) sociodemo-
graphic characteristics; (2) knowledge and perceived barriers
(including health); and (3) self-efficacy. Only respondents
who reported they were able to walk as far as one block were
included in the multivariable analysis.
RESULTS
Focus Groups
The range of physical activities listed varied somewhat
across the race and gender groups, but the three most com-
mon activities were consistently housecleaning, yardwork,
and walking. There was no variability across the groups in
terms of the activity most preferred; walking was the most
preferred and performed activity. Walking was also defined
as exercise, and was the most commonly preferred exer-
cise activity.
Many perceived barriers were noted and these are all pre-
sented with the survey data. The most frequently mentioned
and most significant barriers seemed to be pain (knee pain,
back pain, and hip pain), shortness of breath, and fear of
chest pain. The men seemed to focus more on shortness of
breath, and women more on pain as a barrier. Weather, cold
or hot, was noted as an important perceived barrier, and the
quality of sidewalks was frequently mentioned.
Psychometric Assessments
As noted, self-efficacy consists of evaluations of confi-
dence in one's performance ability and confidence in out-
comes. There were three questions intended to measure each.
Factor analysis of the six items revealed two dimensions that
explained 70% of the variance in responses to the items. The
factor loadings were all over 0.50 and the expected items
loaded together. The interfactor correlation was 0.39. The
Cronbach's alpha coefficients were 0.71 for the self-efficacy
items and 0.81 for the outcome expectations items.
Exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors that ex-
plained 50% of the variance in responses to the perceived
barriers. Minimum factor loadings within the three factors
were all over 0.50. The three factors were labeled environ-
mental, motivational, and symptom. Interfactor correlations
were 0.13 to 0.27. The four perceived environmental barri-
ers were crime, weather, no or poor sidewalks, and having
no place to sit down. Motivational barriers were not enough
will power, lack of interest, and not enough time. Symptom
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND OLDER ADULTS S45
barriers consisted of pain, swelling, fear of chest pain, no
energy, and fear of shortness of breath. These categories of
perceived barriers are not presented as a representation of
underlying factors. It does not seem appropriate, for exam-
ple, to assume that there is one underlying environment af-
fecting physical activity. Rather, the barriers are presented
in the environmental, symptom, and motivation clusters to
better organize the presentation of data.
Two existing physical activity instruments were assessed.
The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and the
Yale Physical Activity Scale (YPAS) have been shown to
have reasonable validity (Dipietro, Caspersen, Ostfeld, &
Nadel, 1993; Schuit, Schouten, Westerterp, & Saris, 1997;
Washburn, Smith, Jette, & Janney, 1993). Both, however,
were developed on relatively healthy, active, and well-edu-
cated subjects. The types of activities described in the PASE,
and particularly the YPAS, are very rare and even unknown in
the population studied here. The PASE is reasonably short (10
to 15 minutes), but the YPAS is very detailed and often takes
longer than 30 minutes. Most importantly, the vast majority of
our respondents were at the floor of the PASE, which assesses
physical activity in terms of hours per day rather than minutes
per day. Among 30 respondents who were administered the
PASE in pilot testing, there was little variability. Twenty-three
of the 30 respondents were at the floor of the walking assess-
ment, and just 4 of the 30 respondents reported any leisure
time physical activity other than walking.
Accordingly, the RPAHS physical activity instrument
was intended to capture average minutes of walking and
other physical activities that involved some perception of
exertion. The number of flights of stairs climbed per day
was also captured. We assessed two-week test-retest relia-
bility of physical activity survey questions on 50 subjects.
The intraclass correlation coefficient for number of stairs
climbed per day was 0.73. Total minutes of physical activ-
ity per week, excluding stair climbing, had an intraclass
correlation coefficient of 0.59.
Cross-Sectional Analyses
Physical activity behavior.--A breakdown of daily stair
climbing, weekly walking, weekly brisk walking, and other
brisk physical activities is shown in Table 2. "Brisk" was
defined as activity that produced tired legs, or increased
heart rate or breathing. Differences across the age and gen-
der groups are also shown.
The last section of Table 2 shows total weekly physical
activity excluding stair climbing. Two thirds of the sample
was found to have reported some weekly physical activity,
and the average total number of minutes of physical activity
for those persons was 97. The 55 to 69 age group was more
likely to report some weekly activity and achieved more
minutes on average than the 70 and older age group. Simi-
larly, men were more likely to report any activity than
women and completed more minutes when they were active.
Self-efficacy.--For each of the two self-efficacy dimen-
sions, higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy. Table 3
presents the results for the sample as a whole, and by age
group and gender. The self-efficacy scores indicate that re-
spondents were a little to somewhat confident of their abil-
ity to perform the activities and durations (i.e., efficacy ex-
pectations), and somewhat to very confident that the activi-
ties and durations would improve their health (i.e., outcome
expectations). Women had significantly poorer efficacy ex-
pectations, and the older age group had significantly poorer
outcome expectations.
Knowledge and perceived barriers.--Table 3 presents in-
formation on physical activity knowledge and perceived
barriers among the RPAHS sample respondents.
On average respondents answered fewer than three of the
six facts about exercise questions correctly, and scores were

somewhat lower for the older age group. Similarly, the
older age group was less likely to report that their physician
had mentioned or discussed physical activity.
Perceived barriers to physical activity were very preva-
lent. Two thirds reported that physical symptoms kept them
from exercising more often. Pain was reported among 50%,
and fear of chest pain (21%) or shortness of breath (29%)
were also common (not shown). The vast majority per-
ceived environmental barriers; 75% noted weather as a bar-
rier and crime was a concern for 50% (not shown). Motiva-
tion was a barrier for about one half of the respondents, but
just 12% reported time as a barrier (not shown).
Multivariate Analysis
In bivariable analyses not shown, all of the physical ac-
tivity knowledge, perceived barrier, and self-efficacy ques-
tions of Table 3 were found to be significantly associated
with weekly physical activity. The model of Table 4 pre-
sents hierarchical, multivariable associations between the
sociodemographic, knowledge, perceived barriers (includ-
ing health and chronic disease), and self-efficacy measures
of Tables 1 and 3 with minutes of weekly physical activity.
Total minutes of physical activity was skewed, so it was
categorized as 0 (51%), 1 to 20 (7%), 21 to 59 (22%), and
60 or more (20%) minutes for these analyses. The same re-
sults were found with the third and fourth categories col-
lapsed to one category, and with the third and fourth cate-
gories expanded to four categories rather than two.
Looking across the models of Table 4, it can be seen that
each block of variables added approximately 6% to the vari-
ance accounted for in minutes of physical activity. The final
model accounted for 17% of the variance. Older age was as-
sociated with slightly less physical activity, and that associa-
tion did not change with the incorporation of additional
blocks of variables, including health and chronic disease. Fe-
male gender, fair or poor health, and symptom barriers were
all associated with less physical activity, and the effect of
each was somewhat reduced with the incorporation of self-
efficacy measures. The association of motivation barriers was
not reduced with the incorporation of self-efficacy. The asso-
ciation of efficacy expectations was highly significant, but the
association of outcome expectations was not.
DISCUSSION
The Department of Health and Human Services (1996)
has recommended a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate
physical activity per week. Just 10% of the RPAHS respon-
dents reported 150 minutes per week. The average weekly
number of minutes of total physical activity was 79 in the
younger age group, whereas the 70 and older age group av-
eraged just 48 minutes of total physical activity per week
(obtained by multiplying the percent active by the mean
number of minutes of activity; not shown). Women aver-
aged 57 minutes of total physical activity per week,
whereas men averaged 78. Efficacy expectations were
higher among men and outcome expectations were higher
in the older age group. Scores on the facts-on-exercise quiz
suggest that important information about exercise and
physical activity may be lacking within this population.
Perceived barriers were very prevalent in all groups.

PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND OLDER ADULTS S47
A theoretical model where perceived barriers and knowl-
edge affect self-efficacy, which in turn affects physical activ-
ity, was only partially supported in a cross-sectional multi-
variable, hierarchical analysis. The associations of perceived
health and symptom barriers were somewhat reduced with the
incorporation of self-efficacy into the model, but the associa-
tion of motivational barriers was not. The facts-on-exercise
quiz score was not associated with physical activity. The
strongest correlates of weekly physical activity that are po-
tentially modifiable were motivation barriers and efficacy ex-
pectations. In some contexts, living status and perceived
health might also be modifiable. The final model accounted
for just 17% of the variance in physical activity, but other re-
ports have accounted for just 12 to 15% with similar mea-
sures (e.g., Sallis et al., 1992). Clearly, work remains to be
done in the theory and measurement of physical activity.
The reliability of the physical activity questions devel-
oped for the RPAHS study will require more investigation.
The test-retest reliability was just 0.59 for minutes of physi-
cal activity per week. The PASE had a test-retest reliability
of 0.75 (Washburn et al., 1993). A measure based on min-
utes of physical activity, however, is likely to be less reli-
able than a measure based on hours of physical activity. As
we found in our pilot test of the PASE, there was consider-
ably less variability in hours of physical activity than in
minutes of physical activity. An individual might state that
he or she never walks more than one hour per day, but may
walk 10 minutes one day and 30 minutes the next. It is also
important to note that we do not know the extent of short-
term fluctuations in physical activity.
Our data suggest that public health campaigns to increase
knowledge of physical activity and its importance have not
reached this most vulnerable population. Although primary
care centers are a site for access to such populations, it may
not be practical to rely on providers to increase physical ac-
tivity knowledge and behavior. The relatively numerous per-
ceived barriers to physical activity found among RPAHS re-
spondents and the complexity of self-efficacy suggest that
efforts far beyond a quick screen for and endorsement of
physical activity will be necessary among those who most
need physical activity education and assistance. Like physi-
cal activity measures, existing physical activity promotional
materials available to providers were not developed with the
inclusion of patients most in need of physical activity pro-
motion (e.g., Long et al., 1996; Marcus et al., 1997). And,
our models suggest that greater knowledge and outcome ex-
pectations are not associated with physical activity. This is
consistent with intervention studies that have found educa-
tion to be necessary but insufficient for changing physical
activity behavior (Dishman & Buckworth, 1996).
Socially and medically vulnerable patients will have to be
included in research and promotion if the public health bene-
fits of physical activity are to be fully realized. The greatest
gains in public health via physical activity will come when
persons who are sedentary adopt moderate-intensity physical
activity (Powell & Blair, 1994). The public health costs of
physical inactivity are substantial. Resources, research, orga-
nization, and training will be required to make professionals
and communities effective in physical activity promotion.
Whether such efforts can be done in a cost-effective manner
will need to be addressed. At present there are no studies
available to estimate the costs and few to estimate the out-
comes of physical activity counseling and promotion.
Further work will be needed to validate the findings of
this study. Few have attempted to survey physical activity
knowledge and behavior in disadvantaged populations, and
we have found that existing instruments are inappropriate
for these populations. This leaves our conclusions open for
question; we developed new measures specifically for this
population and have only been able to partially assess their
reliability and validity. We did not capture data on physical
activities such as gardening and housework, which have
been used as examples of moderate exercise in recent litera-
ture. Focus groups indicated that these activities are rela-
tively limited in this population and there is debate about
whether such activities hold health benefits, particularly if
there is no perception of exertion. Further work is needed to
determine the frequency and benefit of these activities.
The physical activity data contained in the RPAHS survey
are based on self-reports of primary care patients of one pri-
mary care site. Their reports are not representative of those
of older urban primary care patients in general. It must be
kept in mind that all of the physical activity data are self-
reports. It is not typical that White men are underrepresented
in research, but they may in fact by underrepresented in
these data. The focus group was smallest and the survey
sample was smallest among White men, particularly in the
older age group. In addition, with cross-sectional data we
are only able to identify associations between variables and
have relied on theoretical models to direct our conclusions.
Even with these limitations, these data are valuable in that
they provide a first look at the physical activity behaviors,
self-efficacy, knowledge, and perceived barriers of a group
that is difficult to access but has an urgent need for in-
creased physical activity. Given the limited physical activity
found in this survey of disadvantaged older adults, further
efforts to understand behaviors of this population would
seem to be a very important research topic.
