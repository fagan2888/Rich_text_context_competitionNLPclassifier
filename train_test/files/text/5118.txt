Abstract
The perceived speed of a ring of equally spaced dots moving around a circular path appears faster
as the number of dots increases (Ho & Anstis, 2013, Best Illusion of the Year contest). We
measured this ``spinner'' effect with radial sinusoidal gratings, using a 2AFC procedure where
participants selected the faster one between two briefly presented gratings of different spatial
frequencies (SFs) rotating at various angular speeds. Compared with the reference stimulus with
4 c/rev (0.64 c/rad), participants consistently overestimated the angular speed for test stimuli of
higher radial SFs but underestimated that for a test stimulus of lower radial SFs. The spinner effect
increased in magnitude but saturated rapidly as the test radial SF increased. Similar effects were
observed with translating linear sinusoidal gratings of different SFs. Our results support the idea
that human speed perception is biased by temporal frequency, which physically goes up as SF
increases when the speed is held constant. Hence, the more dots or lines, the greater the
perceived speed when they are moving coherently in a defined area.

Introduction
Visual motion provides us with vital information about the environment necessary for our
daily survival. The ability to perceive the speed and direction of external moving objects
enables us to act on the objects or to navigate through the environment safely without being
harmed. While detection of motion and identification of direction have been studied

extensively by psychophysicists, physiologists, and computational neuroscientists, our
knowledge of speed perception is rather limited in terms of its phenomenology and
underlying mechanisms (e.g., see a review by Nishida, 2011). One possible factor limiting
our understanding of speed perception and vision in general is the inverse projection problem
(Palmer, 1999). This problem arises because an infinite number of distal environmental
objects with different shapes and sizes seen in the three-dimensional (3D) world can cast
the same two-dimensional (2D) optical image onto the retina, introducing ambiguities
difficult to solve. A moving distal environmental object further extends the inverse
projection problem into the time domain and possibly introduces more uncertainty and
inaccuracy for the visual system in processing visual motion information. Since the claims
that the human visual system analyses complex visual images by their spatial frequency (SF)
content like a Fourier analyzer (Campbell & Robson, 1968; Sachs, Nachmias, & Robson,
1971), researchers have been using sinusoidal gratings extensively to study human vision. The
speed of a moving stimulus used in researches is consequently expressed in terms of its spatial
and temporal frequencies, and is susceptible to biases from other stimulus properties such as
its luminance contrast (Thompson, Brooks, & Hammett, 2006; Thompson, 1982) and colour
(Cavanagh, Tyler, & Favreau, 1984).
A counterintuitive bias in speed perception was recently demonstrated by Ho and Anstis
(2013) in the 2013 Best Illusion of the Year contest. They later redesigned it as ``the spinner
illusion'' using simpler disk elements, as shown in Figure 1 (see also Appendix Movie 1). The
four yellow dots on the left and the eight yellow dots on the right were both set to revolve at
the same rate, yet all observers consistently reported seeing the dots on the right as rotating
faster than those on the left. In the demonstration video, the number of dots on the right
increases from 4 to 8 and then 12, with the rotation seeming faster with each increase.
The spinner illusion is interesting because there is no obvious reason in physics why
increasing the number of dots should increase their apparent speed, assuming that all the
dots are clearly visible. Ho and Anstis (2013) originally suggested that the greater retinal blur
caused by more dots might make them look faster. While it is known that motion streaks can
enhance motion perception (Apthorp et al., 2013; Geisler, 1999), their influence on speed

physical speed (top), but the perceived speed appears to be faster with eight dots than with four dots

perception has not been established. We therefore measured the spinner effect with sine wave
grating stimuli that are smooth and less susceptible to smearing.
An alternative account would treat this illusion as a partial failure to compute speed from
the temporal frequency (TF) and SF of the stimulus. While local speed is obtained by local
TF divided by SF in theory, this computation might be performed only in an approximate
way. It has been reported that perceived speed of translating one-dimensional (1D) sinusoidal
gratings depends on their SF. Campbell and Maffei (1981) studied rotating 1D gratings and
found that their perceived speed followed an inverted-U function of spatial frequency.
Diener, Wist, Dichgans, and Brandt (1976) reported increased perceived speed at higher
SFs measured by magnitude estimation, a finding that was later echoed by Chen, Bedell,
and Frishman (1998) using a 2AFC procedure. Smith and Edger (1990) showed opposite
results that both perceived speed and TF decreased as the SF increased, but they pointed out
that the results may depend on the range of SFs used.
In the spinner illusion (Figure 1), SF along the circular path of motion increases as the
number, and thus density, of dots increases. Possibly this illusion directly reflects the
spatiotemporal characteristics of the visual system as described earlier. If so, one extreme
possibility would be that speed judgments of rotating stimuli are made on the basis of local
TF, ignoring the SF. Or they might be made as a compromise between the speed and TF of a
rotating stimulus. The results in the literature are not conclusive. One problem is that it is not
straightforward to apply results from the linear gratings to the configuration of a rotating
spinner illusion. We first need to confirm that simple sinusoidal patterns give similar illusions,
and then to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of the illusion parametrically.
We therefore investigated the effect of SF on the spinner illusion in radial gratings
(Figure 2). First, we confirmed that the spinner illusion occurs with simple radial
sinusoidal gratings for nai¨ve participants (Experiment 1). Sinusoidal modulation is also
effective in minimizing the effect of blur, as image blur does not yield motion streaks but
only reduces the effective contrast. Second, we examined whether the illusion depends more
on speed itself or TF, by taking more detailed measurements from trained participants
(Experiment 2). Finally, we confirmed that a similar illusion occurs for translational
motion of one-dimensional gratings (Experiment 3). We will then discuss the cause of this
illusion in terms of general spatiotemporal integration.
Experiment 1
The point of subjective equality (PSE) in perceived speed for two simultaneously presented
rotating radial sinusoidal gratings of different radial spatial frequencies (RSFs) was assessed
psychophysically using a method of constant stimuli. Specifically, the rotating speed of the
matching stimulus (RSF of 4 c/rev: cycle per revolution1) was varied randomly between trials
and was compared with that of the test stimulus (RSF of either 8, 10, or 12 c/rev; used
uniquely in separate experimental blocks) that was kept constant at 0.33 rev/s, in order to
obtain psychometric functions for the estimation of their PSEs. We expected the resulting
PSE to be higher than the veridical speed of the test stimuli (0.33 rev/s) if the spinner effect
occurred.
Methods
Participants. Eight psychology undergraduate students (6 females and 2 males, aged 19­22)
in Kyoto University participated to fulfill partial requirement of a course. They were nai¨ve
Ashida et al. 3
as to the specific purpose of the experiment, although they had seen a demonstration
of the spinner illusion prior to the experiment. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
Apparatus and stimuli. Stimuli were generated and presented by using PsychToolBox 3
(Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997) on MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).
They were presented on one of the three monitors: two 24-inch (BenQ XL2411) and
a 23-inch (Mitsubishi RDT233WX) LCD with 1920 Â 1080 resolution and 60 Hz refresh
rate, driven by PCs running Microsoft Windows 7. Participants rested their heads
comfortably on a chin rest during experiment with a viewing distance at 50 cm. The
mean luminance was 40 cd/m2 for one BenQ and 100 cd/m2 for the others. The
luminance profile of each screen was measured and was linearized using a photometer
(Minolta LM1).
The basic stimulus configuration is shown in Figure 2 (see also Appendix Movie 2). Two
radial gratings, each presented inside a ring-shaped window subtending a visual angle of 8.8,
were centered 5.5 laterally on each side of the central red fixation mark. The width of the
rings was 2.2. The two yoked stimuli always appeared and disappeared on the screen
simultaneously. They had a sluggish temporal envelope: Their luminance contrast was
increased linearly from 0% to 50% in 0.25 s and stayed at 50% for 0.5 s, and then
decreased linearly back to 0% in 0.25 s. The two stimuli rotated in the same direction in
each trial, and both directions were tested within each block of trials.
The RSF for the matching stimulus was 4 c/rev (0.64 c/rad), while the RSF of the test
stimulus was picked from three preset values of 8, 12, or 16 c/rev (1.27, 1.91, and 2.55 c/rad)
and stayed constant within each block of trials.
Figure 2. The basic stimulus configuration. Left: matching stimulus of 4 c/rev, Right: test stimulus of 12 c/rev
as an example. Both stimuli rotated in the same direction. The test and matching sides as well as their yoked
direction of rotation were randomized and balanced across trials. In Experiment 1: a ¼ 2.2, b ¼ 8.8, and
c ¼ 5.5. In Experiments 2 and 3: a ¼ 2.75, b ¼ 11.0, and c ¼ 6.9.
4 i-Perception
The speed for the test stimulus was fixed at 0.33 rev/s (2.09 rad/s) and the speed for the
matching stimulus was picked randomly from seven preset values between 0.17 and 0.67 rev/s
(1.05­4.19 rad/s).
Procedure
The method of constant stimuli was used to present a yoked test-matching stimulus pair on
each trial. The participants judged whether the radial grating inside the left or the right
annulus window appeared faster in a 2AFC procedure and responded by pressing one of
two designated computer keys.
Trials were organized in blocks by the three test RSFs. One block consisted of 28 trials
(7 manipulated speeds Â 2 sides Â 2 rotation directions), and each block was repeated four
times in a pseudorandom order, resulting in 16 measurements per manipulated matching
speed. The computer programme randomized the manipulated speed variations, direction of
stimulus-pair rotation, and the presentation sides of test-matching stimuli.
Results and Discussion
Probit analysis (Finney, 1971; with the scripts by Johnson, Dahlgren, Siegfried, & Ellis, 2013)
was used to estimate each participant's PSE in perceived speed for each test RSF. The results
were collapsed across presentation sides of stimuli and their rotation directions. Figure 3(a)
shows the averaged psychometric functions from all participants, and Figure 3(b) shows
estimated PSE values for all test-matching paired stimuli. It is evident from the data that

matching speed (b) are all consistent with speed overestimation for higher RSFs.

the speed of the matching stimulus needed to be turned up beyond the test speed of 0.33 rev/s
to match the perceived speeds of the test stimuli. In other words, the speed of a higher RSF
test stimulus was consistently overestimated by the participants, which agreed with the
original spinner illusion observation.
Specifically, the participants required the 4 c/rev matching stimulus to rotate 32% to 36%
faster than the actual speed of the high-RSF test stimuli in order to match the perceived
speeds. There was no significant difference in the matched speeds among the test stimuli of 8,
12, and 16 c/rev, F(2,14) ¼ 0.334, p ¼ 0.721 by repeated-measure ANOVA.
The speed overestimation of the test stimuli (>30%) here is similar to the report of 33%
for 8 versus 16 dot condition of the original spinner illusion (Anstis & Ho, 2014). It is,
however, not consistent that our data from Experiment 1 did not reveal differences among
the three high-RSF tests. A possible factor might be compression of perceived speed in a
higher RSF range; tiny differences for higher RSFs may be buried in noise under the ceiling
effect.
We therefore ran an auxiliary experiment with a different speed manipulation in a mirrored
fashion where the speeds of the higher RSF stimuli (8, 12, 16 c/rev) were manipulated
to match the apparent speed of the 4 c/rev reference stimulus. The reference speed used
here was the same as the test speed in the main experiment (0.33 rev/s ¼ 2.09 rad/s).
We used the same set of apparatus, but used PsychoPy (Peirce, 2007) for
stimulus generation and experimental control. The manipulated speed for the test
stimulus was picked randomly from seven preset values between 0.17 and 0.47 rev/s
(1.05­2.96 rad/s). Nine different nai¨ve participants (2 females and 7 male psychology
students, aged 19­22) participated to fulfill partial requirement of a course. Their results
are shown in Figure 3(b) by open symbols. Similar to the findings from the main
experiment, no significant difference in the estimated PSE values was observed among the 8,
12, and 16 c/rev test stimuli, F(2,16) ¼ 1.063, p ¼ .369 by repeated-measure ANOVA.
Participants required the speed of higher RSF test stimuli to be decreased to 72% to 76%
of the actual 4 c/rev reference stimulus speed to perceptually match the perceived rotational
speed of the yoked stimulus pair. By taking the reciprocals of these PSE values, the
result corresponded to a speed overestimation of higher RSF stimuli by 31% to 39%, an
observed spinner effect which is quantitatively consistent with the main results of 33% to
36% obtained in the main experiment. Thus, the results here mirrored those of the main
experiment, indicating that the flat results among the test RSFs is not an artefact of the
ceiling effect.
We then reasoned that the insignificant differences observed could possibly be due to a
high level of internal noise from our nai¨ve participants, lack of regression precision due to
rough sampling of test speeds, or possible dependence of the effects upon the test speed. In
Experiment 2, we therefore further assessed the spinner effect more extensively using trained
participants with a staircase method while adopting a wider range of test RSFs in
combination with multiple test speeds as manipulated variables.
Experiment 2
Participants
One of the authors and two psychophysically trained participants were tested (one female and
two males, aged 22­47). The two participants other than the author were nai¨ve as to the
specific purpose of this experiment, and were paid for their time at the university standard
rate. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
6 i-Perception
Apparatus and Stimuli
The stimuli were generated by using PsychoPy 1.82 (Peirce, 2007), running on an Apple
MacBook Pro 15, and were presented on a 19-inch CRT (EIZO T761) with 1024 Â 768
resolution and 75 Hz refresh rate. The screen was viewed from the distance of 45 cm with
the aid of a chin rest. Luminance profile of the screen was measured and linearized with a
photometer (Photo Research PR-655).
The basic stimulus configuration was the same as in Experiment 1 but 25% larger in size;
the ring-shaped windows subtended 11, with the annulus subtending 2.75 in width
(Figure 2). These two stimulus windows were centered laterally at an eccentricity of 6.9
on both sides of the central fixation mark. The time course of stimulus presentation was
the same, too: linear increase for 0.25 s, staying at 50% for 0.5 s, and linear decrease to zero
for 0.25 s.
The RSF of the matching stimulus used here was again 4 c/rev (0.64 c/rad) as used in
Experiment 1. Five test SFs were used: 2, 8, 12, 16, and 20 c/rev (0.32, 1.27, 1.91, 2.55,
3.18 c/rad) in combination with three test speeds: 0.17, 0.33, and 0.50 rev/s (1.05, 2.09, and
3.14 rad/s).
Procedure
Participants were given the same 2AFC discrimination task as described in Experiment 1,
judging the faster stimulus. All participants were tested with 15 different test stimulus
conditions (i.e., the five test RSFs Â three test speeds as stated earlier) to complete this
experiment. A staircase method (1-up and 1-down) with smaller preset step sizes was used
for capturing more precise changes in participants' responses around the PSE for each test
stimulus.
Each condition was tested in separate blocks of randomly interleaved double staircases
(one staircase for one direction of motion). Each staircase was terminated after 28 trials
(i.e., 56 trials per run with double staircases). Each block was repeated three times,
bringing a grand total of 168 trials per stimulus condition.
Results
Responses were pooled for each test stimulus condition within individual participant. The
perceived matched speed (PSE) for each test stimulus condition was estimated with 95%
confidence intervals using probit analysis (Finney, 1971; Johnson et al., 2013).
Figure 4 shows the results for all three participants. Matched speeds (PSEs) of the
matching stimulus to the test stimuli are plotted as a function of RSF for each participant
in separate panels. Since the 4 c/rev stimulus was used as the matching stimulus, we assumed
the veridical speed to be its perceived speed for each test speed level (marked by larger
symbols in Figure 4). The results look very similar across all three participants. Most of
the test stimuli of 8 c/rev RSF or greater required the matching speed to be set above the
corresponding actual test speed, demonstrating overestimated perceived speed of higher RSF
test stimuli as found in Experiment 1. On the other hand, the matching speeds for the 2 c/rev
test stimulus all fell below their veridical speed lines, revealing an underestimation of
perceived speed for the lower RSF stimulus.
All the PSE curves fell within an area between the constant-TF and veridical test speed
lines, and tended toward horizontal as the RSF of the test stimuli increased. These data reveal
Ashida et al. 7
that the participants made a compromise between the actual speed and the TF of the moving
stimuli in making their speed judgments on the revolving stimuli. The response functions are
also very similar in trend across the three tested speed levels for all tested RSFs, with PSE
values increasing as the RSF and the test speed increase. To compare the results across test
speeds, each participant's PSE data are normalized with the test speeds (i.e., divided by
corresponding test speed) and replotted in a log-log scale as presented in Figure 5(a). Note
that this normalized plot shows quadratic trends for all three test speeds; log-quadratic
functions were fitted well to the averaged data across participants (r2 > .99). The three
curves nearly superimposed on each other except for the one obtained at the lowest test
speed (0.17 rev/s), where PSEs for the lowest and highest RSFs were much lower than
those for the faster test speeds. It is also noticed from the other two fitted curves that
participants' overestimation on perceived speeds for the higher RSF test stimuli started to
level off at 8 c/rev. There are only subtle differences in speed overestimation among the
stimuli of 8 to 16 c/rev, confirming our earlier finding in Experiment 1. We also noticed
that the results from the three participants were quantitatively consistent except for data
points at either end of RSFs examined.
Furthermore, from Figure 5(a), we see that perceived speed on the 2 c/rev stimulus lies
much closer to the oblique TF line than the horizontal line, a characteristic that is opposite
for the higher RSF stimuli. This means that speed perception is more heavily weighted by TF
at low RSFs but more by the actual stimulus speed at high RSFs. To quantify such changes in
weighing on speed perception by the TF characteristics of a revolving stimulus, we evaluated
the contribution of TF by the following equation that can account for the matched speed as a
weighted sum of the constant-TF speed and the stimulus' actual angular speed:

where m is the matched speed for a revolving stimulus, b is the TF-bias weighing factor, STF
is
the constant-TF speed at each spatial frequency, and S is the veridical stimulus speed. TF
would have no effect with b ¼ 0 and the strongest effect with b ¼ 1. Figure 5(b) shows b (solid
lines) and 1 À b (dotted lines) as a function of the RSF, which were obtained by solving this
equation for the averaged results in Figure 5(a) as m for each test speed. This plot reveals that
the TF weighting on speed perception falls almost linearly in a log scale as the RSF of a
stimulus increases. Even though the speed overestimation effect increases for stimuli of higher
RSFs, the effect of TF on speed perception is actually stronger for stimuli of lower RSFs.
This plot also indicates that the effect of TF is larger for a slower speed at the lowest RSF
tested; the reason is not clear, but it could be an artefact of showing very thick stripes in
narrow rings.
The curves may be subject to change by the choice of the matching stimulus. An auxiliary
experiment performed by S1, however, suggested that such a nonlinear effect, if any, might
not be substantial at least for our stimulus set; the speed of the 8 c/rev stimulus was matched
to that of the 16 c/rev stimulus by the same procedure, and the speed of 16 c/rev stimulus was
overestimated by 9.2% with the 95% confidence interval from 5.9% to 12.5%. The data from
S1 in Figure 4 increased by 11.5% from 8 c/rev to 16 c/rev, which falls within this confidence
interval.
In short, the spinner effect is observed with radial sinusoidal stimuli. Perceived speed
of a test stimulus does increase with the RSF of the stimulus, weighted concomitantly
by an increasing TF. But the magnitude of the spinner effect reaches a plateau relatively
quickly at higher RSFs, indicating that the bias toward TF is actually smaller for
higher RSFs. Therefore, possible difference among 8 to 16 c/rev stimuli could be

speeds.
Experiment 3
If the spinner illusion reflects a genuine SF dependent speed overestimation, it may not be
specific to rotational motion. We can actually experience an analogous speed illusion in the
demonstration movie with translating linear gratings (Appendix Movie 3), as also predicted
from previous reports (Chen et al., 1998; Diener et al., 1976). In Experiment 3, we therefore
assessed if analogous characteristics of the spinner illusion would be found in drifting vertical
sine wave gratings. The SFs of the 1D gratings used here were roughly matched to the SF of
the radial stimuli in Experiment 2.
Methods
Participants. The same three participants as in Experiment 2 were tested.
Apparatus and stimuli. The apparatus was the same as in Experiment 2, also controlled with
PsychoPy 1.82 (Peirce, 2007). The layout of the paired matching-test stimulus was similar to
that used in Experiment 2. Here, two 1D vertical sinusoidal grating of different SFs, always
drifting in the same direction, were presented inside two separate, 11 diameter circular
windows on both sides of the central fixation point. Their maximum luminance contrast
was 50%, presented to participants using the same trapezoidal time envelope as before.
The SFs were approximately matched to those of the radial gratings as follows;
luminances were modulated horizontally in the frequencies of 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 cycles per
the circumference of the middle point of the ring in Experiment 2 (i.e., along the circle of
8.25 diameter), resulting in 0.08, 0.15, 0.31, 0.46, and 0.62 c/deg, respectively. The SF of the
matching stimulus was 0.15 c/deg, and that of the test stimulus was one of the other four SFs.
A single standard speed of 8.64 deg/s (corresponding to 0.33 rev/s ¼ 2.09 rad/s of the radial
grating at the middle radius of the ring) was tested.
Procedure. The task and the design was the same as in Experiment 2; each test SF was tested
separately in a double-random-staircase run of 28 trials for each direction, and each run was
repeated three times in a random order.
Results
Probit analysis (Finney, 1971; Johnson et al., 2013) was used to estimate the matched speed at
95% confidence intervals. Figure 6(a) shows the matched speed as a function of the test SF.
Again, the PSE values fell between the area bounded by speed with constant TF and the
veridical base speed of the test stimuli as shown in Figure 5(a), indicating overestimations and
underestimations of perceived speed in higher and lower test SFs, respectively, when
compared with the 0.15 c/deg matching stimulus.
Corresponding data from Experiment 2 were converted in the way as described in the
Apparatus and Stimuli section and were plotted together in Figure 6(a). The pattern of results
is very similar to that of the radial stimuli, as the fitted log-quadratic function (r2 > .99) is
comparable to the adapted curve from Figure 5(a). While the overestimation was somewhat
larger for the linear gratings, this difference is surprisingly small, given many possible
confounds such as imperfect matching of SFs, different stimulus windows, or larger SF

artefacts at the stimulus edges of linear gratings, which are inevitable for the different kinds of
stimuli. This result suggests that the spinner illusion is a consequence of general speed
computation from spatiotemporal frequencies, rather than manifestation of some
idiosyncratic rotation-specific effects.
Figure 6(b) depicts the TF weighting on perceived speeds of drifting gratings in the same
way as in Figure 5(b) but as a function of linear SF. The data for the corresponding condition
in Experiment 2 with radial gratings (standard speed of 0.33 rev/s) are adapted from
Figure 5(b) and are plotted along in this figure. The decline of TF weighting is very
similar for the two types of stimuli. The small difference in the slopes may be due to
several factors as noted earlier.
We should also note that the shape of the curve is similar to that of speed matching by
Jogan and Stocker (2015; their Figure 5(b), test stimuli of A­D), although they did not
discuss this ``single-channel'' response in detail, because their focus was on integration of
such responses in compound SF stimuli.
General Discussion
The spinner illusion demonstrates that perceived speed is affected by the number of dots even
when they move at a constant speed. We have confirmed that this effect generalizes to radial
and linear forms of sinusoidal gratings. The spinner illusion therefore is considered to reflect
a general speed overestimation for high SFs that has been reported in the literature. The effect
of motion blur, if any, is not a necessary condition.

The spinner illusion as a TF bias in spatiotemporal integration
As the spinner illusion occurs in a very similar way for radial and linear gratings, the effect is
consistent with a number of studies that showed higher perceived speed for higher SFs with
linear gratings (Brooks, Morris, & Thompson, 2011; Campbell & Maffei, 1981; Chen et al.,
1998; Diener et al., 1976; McKee & Silverman, 1986). The asymptotic curve in our Figure 6(a)
parallels with Figure 6 in McKee & Silverman (1986) and Figure 3 of Brooks et al. (2011).
Smith and Edgar showed opposite results of speed underestimation for high SFs, but as
they discussed (1990, p. 1473), their results are not necessarily in conflict because they used
higher range of SFs (0.5­2 c/deg) than ours (0.08­0.68 c/deg) and Diener et al.'s (0.01­
0.07 c/deg); the overall SF tuning might be inverted U-shaped as observed in Campbell
and Maffei (1981).
Taken together, these results support a bias toward TF in the spinner illusion, as Anstis
and Ho (2014) proposed. TF should increase along with increasing SF in order to keep the
speed constant, and this higher TF could bias speed coding. Although we can make speed and
TF judgments independently (Smith & Edgar, 1990, p. 1469), nai¨ve judgments may be
erroneously contaminated by the TF. This, however, does not seem to explain our
compelling perception of speed difference in the spinner illusion demonstrations. Also, the
results were consistent across nai¨ve and trained participants in our experiments. The TF bias
therefore could be an innate property in speed perception.
It is conceived that the visual system initially takes separate measures in space and time
(i.e., SF and TF), and then integrates these measures into the metric of speed at the level
of V1 complex cells to the area MT/V5 both in macaques (Priebe, Cassanello, &
Lisberger, 2003; Priebe, Lisberger, & Movshon, 2006) and also in humans (Lingnau,
Ashida, Wall, & Smith, 2009). Integration across space and time is then required for
perceiving global pattern of linear or circular motion (e.g., Morrone, Burr, & Vaina,
1995). While the TF bias may arise at any of these stages, the results of similar spinner
effects on circular and translating motions might suggest that it occurs before the stage of
global integration.
The exact mechanism of the TF bias in speed perception is yet to be investigated, but our
results of stronger TF bias for lower SFs might be explained by hypothetical receptive fields
that are not large enough for the low-SF stimuli. The nominal SF of our stimuli extends
down to 0.08 c/deg, that is, 12.5 deg/c. This is larger than the human population receptive
field sizes, measured by using fMRI, in most visual areas including putative human MT and
MST up to the eccentricity of 10 in the periphery (Amano, Wandell, & Dumoulin, 2009).
Appendix Movie 4 shows a hypothetical receptive field that covers less than one cycle of a
low-SF drifting grating, which is therefore seen as mostly flickering with very little motion
signal. On the other hand, the same receptive field can register several moving bars of a high-
SF grating, so the direction of motion is now unambiguous--and also looks fast. This simple
model explains both the basic spinner effect, that fine bars appear to move faster than coarse
bars, and also the fact that speed judgments of coarse moving bars are more strongly
weighted by TF than by actual velocity.
Note that the illusion could be understood in accordance with the gradient-based models
of motion detection (e.g., Anstis, 1967, 1990; Johnston, McOwan, & Buxton, 1992; Marr &
Ullman, 1981). In the case of sinusoidal modulation, because d/dt[sin(ft)] ¼ fcos(ft),
maximum temporal gradient is proportional to TF. Speed perception could be understood
as biased toward temporal gradient instead of TF.

Ecological Interpretations
For periodic grating patterns, SF (or RSF) is a reciprocal of the size of each bar. The spinner
effect therefore parallels the classic report of Brown (1931) that ``other things being equal
larger figures are phenomenally slower'' (p. 222). It is, however, not fully understood why
speed perception depends on size. A possible account could refer to speed constancy across
distances; as an object comes closer, the retinal size and speed increase when the physical
speed is constant. While Brown (1931) argued that constancy of velocity (i.e., speed) is not
fully deducible from size constancy, Rock, Hill, and Fineman (1968) concluded that size
constancy and speed constancy are indeed related, from the results of experiments without
visible frames of references.
The rotating spinner illusion is not readily explained by speed constancy because
RSF does not change across distances. On the other hand, the two-dimensional SF
components along the x-y coordinates do change with distance for both linear or radial
gratings, while TF remains constant. TF is therefore a more invariant measure than SF
across distances, which may be one reason for more dependence on TF in speed
computations.
Other possible explanations might refer to the statistical tendency that lower SFs are likely
more stable than higher SFs in the scene. This is related to the hypothesis of Bayesian prior
for slow motion (Jogan & Stocker, 2015; Vintch & Gardner, 2014; Weiss, Simoncelli, &
Adelson, 2002), reflecting the fact that the world is mostly stable while smaller objects can
move around, although this might not always hold (Hammett, Champion, Thompson,
Morland, 2007).
Limitations
There remains a question: Why does the speed appear to get faster steadily whenever the
number of discs increase in the original spinner illusion, while the perceived speed saturated
rapidly in our experiments? A potential cause for the discrepancy might be the high-SF
harmonic components in the dot stimuli, as Brooks et al. (2011) showed that a complex
grating of 1f þ 2f SF components yielded less asymptotic curves of speed overestimation
for higher SFs than a simple grating. Smith and Edgar (1991) also revealed nonlinear ways
of combining element speeds in various complex gratings, but how this is related to the
spinner illusion remains open for further investigation. Another factor could be the retinal
blur due to sharp edges that might add to the effect, as Ho and Anstis (2013) originally
postulated.
The physical contrast was always held constant at 50% in our experiments, and there
could have been a confound of perceived contrast across SFs, since perceived speed depends
on contrast (Thompson, 1982). We do not, however, consider that this effect is crucial in our
case, because the effect of contrast is less clear for high-contrast stimuli. While Stone
and Thompson (1992) showed that the effect does not saturate up to 70% contrast, Smith
and Edgar (1990) informally noted that the perceived speed was independent of contrast
above 10%.
Another remaining question is the generality of the spinner effect for second-order stimuli
that cannot be computed from spatial and temporal frequencies, which is currently under
investigation by one of the authors (A. H.).
