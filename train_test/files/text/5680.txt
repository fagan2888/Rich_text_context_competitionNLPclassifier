Introduction
We are researchers in managing people in the workplace.
With this article, we wish to study a concept that is dear to
the field of entrepreneurship--autonomy--and present it
from a management perspective with a personalist approach.
Most entrepreneurs share a wish to be autonomous and to
control their environment. A number of research projects
suggest that autonomy is an important entrepreneurial moti-
vation (Van Gelderen, 2010). Alstete (2008) has shown that
business people value independence and freedom. This con-
firms the need for autonomy and independence described by
Kets de Vries (1977). Several years later, this same author
explored the need for control experienced by entrepreneurs.
This need can be linked to the fears of being at the mercy of
others (Kets de Vries, 1985). Nelson (2004) supported this
idea when he says that entrepreneurs do not like to be con-
trolled. The need for control is reflected in the concept of
locus of control. According to Rotter (1966), an individual's
locus of control can be either internal or external. While the
internal locus of control refers to an individual who believes
that events in his or her life are caused by factors that can be
controlled, the external locus of control refers to an indi-
vidual who attributes the cause of events to others, the envi-
ronment, destiny, or chance. Even if empirical data have not
been able to strongly authenticate the links between the
internal locus of control and the entrepreneur, these links
exist regardless (Janssen & Surlemont, 2009). Lumpkin and
Dess (1996) clarified what they mean by autonomy:
"Autonomy refers to the independent action of an individual
or a team in bringing forth an idea or a vision and carrying it
through to completion" (p. 140). For Lumpkin, Cogliser,
and Schneider (2009), autonomy is an important component
of an entrepreneurial orientation (EO). A high level of
autonomy within EO has "show[n]a significantly higher
level of performance than those with a lower level of EO"
(Lee & Lim, 2009, p. 12). Autonomy is one of the factors
that may be present when a firm engages in new entry
(Covin & Wales, 2012).
Van Gelderen and Jansen (2006) described the etymology
of the word "autonomy." It comes from two words: self
(autos) and rule or law (nomos). According to these authors,
there is a broad consensus that "autonomy means that indi-
viduals make their own choice independent of others" (Van
Gelderen & Jansen, 2006, p. 6). Autonomy is one of "the
qualities regularly attributed to the entrepreneurial personal-
ity" (Kets de Vries, 1996, p. 857). Autonomy is essential for
the process to take advantage of a company's existing
strengths; it may help develop new ventures or improve busi-
ness practices. Autonomy is necessary to cultivate and
develop entrepreneurial initiatives. Lumpkin and Dess
(1996) defined autonomy as "the independent action of an
individual or a team in bringing forth an idea or a vision and
carrying it through to completion" (p. 140).

The Support to an Entrepreneur:
From Autonomy to Dependence
Marie-Noëlle Albert1 and Marie-Michèle Couture1
Abstract
Entrepreneurs are often associated with autonomy, but one of the coauthors, the sole owner of a microbusiness, had a
different experience. Based on this, we used an autobiographical narrative method in a constructivist paradigm to explore
this phenomenon that is autonomy. The coauthor's different experience developed the idea that difficulties lived by an
entrepreneur can transform autonomy into dependence. This negative complex process is grounded on a request for help
by the entrepreneur and the dissymmetric relation between the person who needs help and the support. This kind of
relationship promotes a loss of the entrepreneur's capacities. A non-co-construction of solution (by the entrepreneur and
the support) is not only less productive, but could also develop a very negative process. This finding is important to better
understand support to entrepreneurs.

Based on Kanfer (1990, 1994), Van Gelderen and Jansen
(2006) distinguished two kinds of motives for autonomy:
distal and proximal. The proximal motive for autonomy is
associated with task characteristics, the sources of motiva-
tion being located in the work itself. As autonomy is a deci-
sional freedom, distal motives are often present in those
wishing to start a business for themselves: to avoid a boss or
restriction, to act in a self-endorsed and self-congruent man-
ner, and to be in charge are three distal motives.
Instead of Covin and Slevin's (1991) model that focuses
on the role of entrepreneurship as firm behavior (Lumpkin &
Dess, 1996), this article places the emphasis on the entrepre-
neur as a person.
It is true that business people are often associated with
autonomy and freedom or with the need to control their des-
tiny. But this was not completely the case for one of the coau-
thors of this article, the sole owner of a microbusiness.
However, the coauthor's experience does not seem to be so
different from that of other entrepreneurs after all. Narratives
by entrepreneurs abound because entrepreneurs are generally
inclined to sharing their experiences and are happy to be the
subject of discussion (McKenzie, 2007). Most of these narra-
tives involve heroes who have succeeded. This article will
present a narrative describing an entrepreneur grappling with
difficulties. The entrepreneur had a project that she knew
must be changed, resulting in her no longer feeling free and
autonomous. The goal of our work was to examine this entre-
preneur's transformation process, from her state of mind at
the beginning of her project to the feeling of being depen-
dent. In this article, we wish to understand how supporting
entrepreneurs may lead to a decrease in their autonomy and
an increase in their dependence. First, we explain the meth-
odology used: an autobiographical narrative method. Second,
we present autobiographical narratives and related work: the
birth of an idea and the need to review the project.
Method
Research in social sciences increasingly uses narratives and
biographical methods (Haynes, 2006). Historically, these
methods can be traced back all the way to the ancient Greeks
(Gould, 2006), but they are not currently used in manage-
ment studies. For example, Boje and Tyler (2008) and
Haynes (2006, 2011) used auto-ethnographies while intro-
spection is emerging in consumer research (Gould, 2012).
Different kinds of similar approaches exist under different
names: autobiography, auto-ethnography, introspection,
personal narratives, narratives of the self, personal experi-
ence narratives, self-stories, first-person accounts, personal
essays, auto-observations, personal ethnography, and reflex-
ive ethnography, among others. Researchers do not agree on
the limitations of each of these categories (Ellis and Bochner,
2003). With all these reflexive methods, researchers seek to
make sense of personal experiences as opposed to existing
research.
The use of autobiographical methods could be perceived
as "insufficiently rigorous, theoretical, and analytical" (Ellis,
Adams, & Bochner, 2010, p. 11) for scientific standards.
"Self-study researchers have also exhibited the need to wres-
tle with the question of the validity of their studies" (Feldman,
2003, p. 26). Even if these methods seem to have no scien-
tific content (in a positivist way; Hackley, 2007; Holbrooks,
1995; Rod, 2011), it is more important to be relevant with
regard to the epistemological paradigm that has been chosen.
For this reason and to help legitimize it, this kind of method
has to be developed in a nonpositivist paradigm. In the para-
digm of pragmatic constructivism, research legitimizes
knowledge by internal and external reflexive work. In this
case, knowledge is not found in the narrative, but is built
from it.
The paradigm of pragmatic constructivism is based on
radical constructivism as conceptualized by von Glasersfeld
(2001), Vico, as well as James and Piaget (Avenier, 2010). In
this epistemological paradigm, knowledge neither claims to
reflect an ontological reality (for nobody could rationally
prove its existence) nor does it reveal its characteristics when
this reality exists. This constructivism is not so extreme that
it rejects the notion of essence entirely (Grint, 1998). In this
paradigm, while knowledge is being constructed, there is no
distinction between the inquirer and the phenomenon being
inquired into. They simply cannot be distinguished because
what results from the observer's viewpoint (an explicit or
implicit theoretical hypothesis) is that which influences
observations. Pragmatic constructivism considers that truth
is meaningless because of the way knowledge is built from
human representations to give meaning to situations in which
they are involved. Therefore, producing knowledge does not
mean having a true representation of reality, but rather pos-
sessing ways and means to understand life.
Besides, in a constructivist epistemological framework,
the status of knowledge is openly acknowledged as a plau-
sible hypothesis. This relies on the notion of generic knowl-
edge as introduced by the pragmatist philosopher Dewey.
Generic knowledge involves knowledge about various kinds
of things (Dewey, 1938), rather than knowledge about statis-
tical regularities (Prasada, 2000). Generic knowledge has the
particularity that, to be utilized in a specific setting, it needs
to be re-contextualized according to the idiosyncratic cir-
cumstances of the setting in question.
Reflexive work is what researchers do when they behave
as reflexive practitioners of scientific research. It consists of
tracking what seems self-evident and digging into the
implicit assumptions made and the deep meaning of the
notions that are used or newly introduced. The researcher
often uses a large body of academic literature to understand
local knowledge, not to seem scientific but to stand back and
understand it differently. As the word validation has a strong
connotation in a scientific context, that of having resisted all
the hypothesis testing performed hitherto, following Weick
(1979), we prefer to use the term legitimization to refer to
Albert and Couture 3
the process by which some kind of validity is assigned to the
knowledge that is built. Legitimization is not absolute, but
context and goal-dependent. When researchers want to use
autobiographical research methods and produce legitimized
knowledge within the paradigm of pragmatic constructiv-
ism, they have to produce reflexive work. Autobiography is
therefore an abductive process (Minowa, Visconti, &
Maclaran, 2012), that is to say, a constant back and forth
between empirical information and the theories and con-
cepts used to understand this process (Avenier, 2010). From
our viewpoint, this means that an autobiographical narrative
is not in and of itself scientific knowledge, but helps in its
construction.
Some Guidelines Could Help to
Legitimize Knowledge That
Stems From Autobiography
On Writing Narrative
·
· "Autobiographical self-studies should ring true and
enable connection" (Bullough & Pinnegar, 2001, p. 16).
·
· "Self-studies should promote insight and interpreta-
tion" (Bullough & Pinnegar, 2001, p. 16).
·
· "Quality autobiographical self-studies attend care-
fully to persons in context or setting" (Bullough &
Pinnegar, 2001, p. 18).
·
· "Autobiographical self-study research must engage
history forthrightly and the author must take an honest
stand" (Bullough & Pinnegar, 2001, p. 16).
It is essential that the reader believe the narrative that it
seems realistic. This is called verisimilitude (Ellis, 2004). At
first, an autobiographical narrative is written in a completely
naive way, without trying to understand, at the time of its
writing, what happened and why. Narrators simply talk about
what they experienced and how they lived it, like talking
about their day when they get home from work or recounting
their holidays to a friend. To provide specific context, practi-
tioners/researchers must modify, rework, deconstruct, and
reconstruct their narrative, until it is as exact and rigorous a
reflection of their story as possible, just like it was lived. In
other words, the text must be crystal clear to any reader. In
contrast to a literary autobiography, narrators must stay away
from intrigue, mystery, and poetry. The narrative serves as
empirical material for scientific research; it is not about enter-
tainment, even though we may want it to be pleasant to read.
On Reflexive Work
·
· "Authentic voice is a necessary but not sufficient con-
dition for the scholarly standing of biographical self-
study" (Patton, 2002, p. 571).
·
· "Powerful autobiographical self-studies portray char-
acter development and include dramatic action:
Something genuine is at stake in the story" (Bullough
& Pinnegar, 2001, p. 17).
·
· "Interpretations made of self-study data should not
only reveal but also interrogate the relationships, con-
tradictions, and limits of the views presented"
(Bullough & Pinnegar, 2001, pp. 19-20).
Within the paradigm of pragmatic constructivism, it is
essential to carry out reflexive work to ensure the scientific
character of a study (Avenier, 2010). This is based on elab-
orated knowledge and the cognitive process involved in
the development of this knowledge. Because this work is
deliberate, it consists of questioning the real meaning hid-
den behind the notions elaborated or mobilized, putting
them in theoretical and practical perspectives, articulating
them in the currently accepted knowledge, and proceeding
to their deconstruction-reconstruction (Avenier & Schmitt,
2005).
In a continuous process, the narrative approach helps us
understand the emergence of a phenomenon by identifying
the key moments that caused it, rather than by discerning the
conditions that made its emergence necessary. The events
were explained by the story that made them what they are
(Becker, 1998). Practitioners/researchers use this opportu-
nity to revisit their narrative several times to find and develop
what was at first implicit or unconscious. With this kind of
research, we seek to learn "how" we know rather than con-
firm "what" we know, which is in line with approaches pro-
posed by Yanow (2006), Shehata (2006), Schön (1993), and
Wallendorf and Brucks (1993).
Research must be part of a distancing process, aiming to
differentiate facts from perceptions. This process supposes
the explicitness of main elements on which this kind of work
is based. To accomplish their autobiographical work,
researchers must compare and contrast personal experience
against existing research (Ellis et al., 2010). They develop
personal narratives with diversified and heterogeneous sci-
entific literature and theoretical frameworks from different
academic disciplines. In other words, the inquirer could
decontextualize knowledge through the systematic study of
multiple comparisons (Charmaz, 2003; Glaser & Strauss,
1967). Conscious that their interpretation of lived events can
never be verified, practitioners/researchers have to appre-
hend these events from diverse viewpoints. These new
understandings trigger a reflection process, requiring the
writing of the other elements of the story that have emerged.
This new material must also be put to the test, and so on until
saturation.
On the Production of Generic Knowledge
·
· "The autobiographical self-study researcher has an
ineluctable obligation to seek to improve the learning
situation not only for the self but for the other"
(Bullough & Pinnegar, 2001, p. 17).
4 SAGE Open
·
· "Quality autobiographical self-studies offer fresh per-
spectives on established truths" (Bullough & Pinnegar,
2001, p. 18).
Even if the narrative is personal, it has to resonate with
readers; what is sought is neither the elaboration of singular
stories nor a "self-therapy" exercise. The purpose of setting
words to the researcher's experience (local knowledge), with
hindsight and rigor, is the elaboration of actionable knowl-
edge by practitioners (generic knowledge), in other words, of
establishing heuristic benchmarks for actions (Avenier,
2010).
This method, where the researcher and the practitioner are
one, like any other involving a reflexive practitioner, pro-
vides access to information that would not be revealed
through questions or observations in other more "traditional"
methods. The meaning given to knowledge gained through
experience can be innovating or challenge other studies
(Ellis et al., 2010). Prasada (2000) and Carlson and Pelletier
(1995) pointed out that generic knowledge expresses proper-
ties that are considered essential to characterize the studied
phenomenon, even if in pragmatic constructivism generic
knowledge is not invalidated by the existence of what might
be considered a counterexample. However, when using bio-
graphical methods in research, we must also consider that
there are undoubtedly limits to our knowledge of the past,
due to subjectivity, and even authors who are the protago-
nists of their own story can reach these limits (Filion &
Akizawa, 2012). While trying to be as sincere as possible,
everything is not related or even relatable.
The generic knowledge presented in this article makes
sense to other entrepreneurs and those who support them. We
presented this knowledge to several people and they could
relate to it. Even if this is based only on the experiences of
one coauthor, we can still construct not only local knowledge
but also generic knowledge.
Autobiographical Narrative and
Related Reflective Work
The autobiographical narrative and the reflective work are
presented in chronological order to make them easier to read.
The narrative is divided into two parts: the birth of an idea
and the need to review the project. Each piece of narrative is
italicized and followed by the related work.
The Birth of an Idea
Almost 20 years ago, my grandfather, who did not know how
to read or write, passed away without having left us his
"salted onions" recipe. What a calamity! It was one of the
family's favorite condiments. After several years of suffering,
without this much enjoyed condiment, I at last found an uncle
who had the recipe and was willing to give it to me.
Wonderful! Life could now go back to normal.
After having eaten my fill of this much enjoyed condiment
for a good while, I thought to myself that this palace "jewel"
deserved to be known by all and shared like the Good News!
Once I had talked a little about this idea to those around me,
I realized that this would not be easy: the product was com-
pletely unknown; its name meant "unhealthy"; the neces-
sary investments could be significant; the market for this
type of condiment has been mostly taken over by Heinz and
others like it, and so on. In spite of all this, I made the recipe
and, taking my courage in both hands, presented it to an
organization for economic development. Following the
interview, I did not receive any news, not a phone call, not a
word, not any advice, not even a procedure to follow . . . I
was disappointed. I must point out here that, just like prob-
ably a good many potential entrepreneurs, I felt insecure,
about my idea and the means to turn it into reality. Being
supported seemed essential for me to get my project off the
ground.
Seven or eight years later, my career was at a dead end. I
had worked about 5 years at a job at which I was not suc-
cessful and for which I was paid solely on commission. I had
to find something else, but my personal circumstances made
it necessary for me to stay in Rimouski, even though my com-
petences would have been better suited to a big city. In the
meantime, I had almost finished an undergraduate degree in
Business Management. I felt more confident in presenting a
business proposal to those involved. I enjoyed cooking, so I
wanted to go back to my idea of the "salted onions" recipe.
But as I felt I had appeared completely crazy during my first
attempt, this time I wanted to take more precautions.
If my family had almost lost its favorite recipe, there were
likely other families in the same situation. The idea of "sav-
ing" this heritage seemed interesting to me. I presented a
preliminary project to an organization responsible for the
economic development of my region. (Obviously, if I had
been lucky, this whole story would have been completely dif-
ferent.) The response I received left me puzzled: "Your proj-
ect is too big. You should think about doing it step by step.
Your kind of business is usually done on a very small scale.
You build your clientele little by little." On a small scale?
Yes, you make more than what you would normally at home,
then sell what is left over to people in your area who are
interested in the product, and so on. This is how your clientele
will grow. Once you have enough customers, then you can think
about building a company.
But I did not want a lucrative hobby! I wanted my own
business to earn a living! Considered stubborn, I went over
my project once more to make it "work" within the criteria
of the development organization. Instead of a "large fac-
tory" to preserve culinary traditions, I would make a very
small local workshop, with products on sale locally.
Once more, I presented my project and was told that "our
organization is not involved in retail businesses." How could
Albert and Couture 5
I be small and big? No problem! I knew that I was able to
finance the project with personal loans as it was, so I decided
to risk it all.
At the beginning, the project did not fulfill the require-
ments of eligibility established by agencies that provide tech-
nical assistance and funding, and it was too small for
financial institutions. No problem! I decided to start out with
a personal loan. The real-estate market in my location did
not have any commercial space that met my needs, but never
mind, I resigned myself to renting a space that was too big
and too expensive, and poorly situated. I would work harder
and that was it.
Block and Wagner (2010) noted a difference with respect
to motivation when starting a business. The project initiator
(the entrepreneur) is either attracted to entrepreneurship, to
the opportunities it offers, or brought to the project through
necessity. These kinds of entrepreneurships are tied to aspi-
rations, motivations, and factors that influence human behav-
ior (Acs, 2006; Hessels, Gelderen, & Thurik, 2008; Johnson
& Darnell, 1976). For Hessels et al. (2008), there are three
types of motivation to start a business: pull or push motives,
cost-benefit motives, depth-psychological motives (need for
achievement, the need for power). Opportunity entrepreneur-
ship depends on "pull" factors, that is, whether business
start-ups generate material advantages or not, such as auton-
omy, independence, freedom, money, challenges, social sta-
tus, or even recognition (Carter, Gartner, Shaver, &
Gatewood, 2003; Kolvereid, 1996). Necessity entrepreneur-
ship depends on "push" factors, that is, when development
results from the project initiator being in an adverse situa-
tion, such as unemployment, layoff, or the threat of losing
one's job (Thurik, Carree, van Stel, & Audretsch, 2008).
Despite innovations in the product and concept, the project
our article focuses on emerged from a dead end on the labor
market, making this a case of necessity entrepreneurship.
However, necessity and opportunity can be said to mesh and
meld in this project. Dawson and Henley (2012) addressed
the conceptual ambiguities linked to the pull and push factors
categorization. They distinguish external push factors (lack
of alternative opportunities and resources, as well as redun-
dancy), external pull factors (resources, market opportuni-
ties,andinnovation),internalpushfactors(jobdissatisfaction,
as well as family and financial constraints), and internal pull
factors (financial resources, autonomy, challenges, and per-
ceived self-efficacy). The entrepreneur felt free to carry out
her project at that time: She interpreted the opportunity the
project offered as a way of meeting her needs (necessity).
She believed in her project. She had both pull and push,
internal and external, motivations. But in this case pull moti-
vation was not based on business attractiveness as it is usu-
ally viewed (autonomy, independence, freedom, money,
challenges, social status, or even recognition); it was based
on the will to develop an interesting project.
The coauthor/entrepreneur's initial project was what
motivated her to start a business. Of course, she would have
liked to make enough money to live on, but the main purpose
of her project was to produce, sell, and promote traditional
recipes, not to make money per se.
In this study, the entrepreneur's representations of her aspi-
rations, skills, and resources, and of the possibilities offered by
her environment created a space in which she could plan her
business project (Bruyat & Julien, 2001). The project was con-
sequently unique and personal as it was the product of a single
individual at a certain point in time. The space was clearly
defined by that person's representations, which were real only
to her and reflected her personal view of her environment.
This strengthened the specific and unique character of the
project that would be developed in this realm of possibilities.
The entrepreneur sought to give meaning to the present by
projecting on it a potential future.Thus, taking action depended
on a perfect balance between the player (our entrepreneur),
what attracted her, and the right moment (Fayolle, Basso, &
Tornikoski, 2011).Aproject initiator's environment is the goal
and the means (Bruyat & Julien, 2001).
Located between the trigger and completion, the commit-
ment stage in Fayolle et al.'s (2011) entrepreneurial commit-
ment theory underlines a certain unrealistic optimism (UO)
described by Coelho (2010). UO refers to an underestimation
of the likelihood of experiencing negative events and to an
overestimation of the probability of experiencing positive
events (Weinstein & Klein, 1996, p. 2), that is, a mismatch
between subjective and objective probabilities. Hence, UO
implies that the mean forecast errors are significantly differ-
ent from zero.
Most people believe they have above-average abilities
and have above-average chances of attaining a better future
than others. However, this egocentric bias does not appear
only when people compare themselves with others, but also
in absolute terms. As commitment develops throughout the
project, the entrepreneur considers no obstacle as being too
great to overcome. Escalating commitment (Staw, 1976)
leads to irreversibility. Creating is perceived as preferable to
any other project of change and resistance to change can be
overcome (Fayolle et al., 2011). We can therefore ask if UO
(Coelho, 2010) is inevitable or essential for business project
initiators. Even if autonomy was not a motivating factor for
our coauthor in becoming an entrepreneur, it helped her to
take control of her situation and start her business.
Need to Review the Project
After operating for about a year, the business was not getting
off the ground enough to break even, and I believed I was at
the end of my financial resources. Once more I appealed to
the Local Development Centre, which, this time, agreed to
help me. The person responsible for my application was able
to get me a small loan for young entrepreneurs and intro-
duced me to another organization that agreed to pay for a
marketing consultant. At last, I received financing from a
government bank and a micro-credit organization.
6 SAGE Open
After all this preparation, what still remained was the
impression that the consultant lacked creativity. Yes, he had
brought in a new idea, but without any link to the primary
goal of the business or to my own aspirations. This left me
with a very strong feeling of being abandoned by the consul-
tant because he didn't accompany me in the implementation
of his solution (i.e., including a restaurant space reserved for
soups and sandwiches at the front of the store, for a better use
of the space itself). This technical assistant/consultant did not
move beyond the theoretical level, then he "disappeared,"
and the financial partners agreed to provide only the resources
necessary to the survival of the business, not the resources
essential for the implementation of the whole plan.
Still, the business survived another year, at which time it
became increasingly obvious that its chances of success were
very slim. And here we go again! I started over once more:
consulting, planning, and giving up before the implementa-
tion of the project. In fact, there was no implementation fol-
lowing the second consultation. I did not think I had the
resources or the means necessary to make it work.
From that moment, while continuing to kick over the
traces, to rant, to get angry, and to fight for this project, I
was sad. Reapplying for help was not an easy task. I had to
get to be convinced that I could be myself there. I needed
support, knowledge, competent support from someone else.
But I had the impression of being left on my own, of being
robbed of my project. This was more challenging than it
seemed, more than simply accepting help from the consultant
and following the advice given. I had to take into account all of
my constraints. In fact, I didn't ask "what to do" or "how to do
it" anymore. I asked for support in helping me reach my goal.
My enthusiasm, ambition, or dreams no longer had a place. It
waslikeamountainofrubblethatsuddenlyfellonme.Although
I was strong and autonomous and I wanted to stay free in body
and mind, at this point I had to accept that I couldn't do any-
thing more by myself for this project. I felt small and fragile. I
no longer had any choices. I was overwhelmed by everything .
. . I didn't know what to do anymore.
Still, it seemed like I remained confident because, over
time, I successfully convinced myself that I could still avoid
the worst. The consultant's ideas resurfaced: Transforming
my business into a "fondue" restaurant. I said farewell to the
original project that I cherished, and presented this new
project to financial partners, who accepted it without ques-
tioning where it might lead.
And indeed, it was too little, too late, may be too far above
my expectations. My responsibilities turned into shackles,
and after 18 months I had to close shop. I was in very bad
shape, physically, morally, and financially.
Epilogue: This experience certainly left marks, when
everything was said and done. After a major surgery, a long
period of rest, and a career change, I am now in perfect
health, but I don't love cooking as much as before!
Waele, Morval, and Sheitoyan (1993) defined the appro-
priation process as the continuous flow of appropriation by
people, which contributes (through the learning and aware-
ness stages) to building reference points that enable people to
find their place in the organization where they work. One of
the flaws of the appropriation process may be the interpreta-
tion of information based on prior mental schemas while
blocking new data. People then deprive themselves of useful
lessons and become attached to outdated and unsuitable
behaviors, which likely lead to failure (Waele et al., 1993).
The entrepreneur in this case could not accept advice from
the consultants because they did not correspond to her initial
project with which she had such strong emotional ties.
Consulting changed the entrepreneur's goal, which was a
major motivation to start her business. The consultant modi-
fied the project (from the production of traditional recipes to a
restaurant). This transformation discouraged the entrepreneur.
The new project was too distant from her original project. This
created a discomfort that led her to close her business. Advice
can be good or bad, but if it restricts entrepreneurs'autonomy,
such advice can cause trouble. Shahidi (2012) explained that
some entrepreneurs should refuse to be supported because
they need independence, freedom, and the appropriation of
their own creation. In our story, the consultant did not show
her how, given her resources, she could implement the recom-
mendations. Because of this, she did not manage to detach
herself from her prior schemas. From her point of view, the
information was not realistic and her projects did not seem to
be part of any plausible future. She may have felt as if she was
getting double-speak from the consultant. He gave her advice
with solutions that took into consideration neither her project
nor her means, despite the fact that the project was her first
motive to start her business. This kind of behavior displayed
by consultants can inhibit awareness and curiosity (Waele et al.,
1993). In our case, the consultant refused to get involved in the
implementation of the project, using as reason that he did not
want to hinder the entrepreneur's autonomy. These contradic-
tions can make the appropriation process difficult and foster a
sense of malaise (Waele et al., 1993).
This can be perceived as a paradox. Autonomy is very
important for entrepreneurs. It helps them turn their projects
into reality. Seeking support may put the entrepreneur in a
weak position, which may increase the perception of their
need for help. This perceived weakness may in turn decrease
the entrepreneur's autonomy. There is an unequal relation-
ship between the consultant and the entrepreneur. This sup-
port, even if well intended could create a perception of
vulnerability where the entrepreneur is concerned. Seeking
help may decrease self-esteem. There may be a social stigma
attached to seeking professional help, that is, the fear that
people may judge a person negatively if he or she seeks help
(Vogel, Wade, Wester, Larson, & Hackler, 2007). This fear
about others'perception was interiorized by our entrepreneur
and influenced her behavior, as Mead (1934/1974) expressed
with his generalized "other" that may foster a feeling of
incompetence. When consultants propose their own solu-
tions they risk hindering entrepreneurs'autonomy. With their
Albert and Couture 7
advice, consultants apply informal pressure, whether inten-
tionally or not. In our case, the coauthor/entrepreneur felt
forced to follow her consultant's advice, although it was not
a formal obligation. Even if she did not like it, she thought
that she had to do what the consultant suggested. This infor-
mal power seemed to hinder the entrepreneur's autonomy.
Bauman and Döring (2011) distinguished the condition of
autonomy from the capacity for autonomy.
Being autonomous presupposes that a person has several
capacities, most prominently capacities for self-reflection and
rationality (rational self-control). But merely having these
capacities does not guarantee that a person is autonomous
because other persons or the social environment she lives in
might prevent her from effectively exercising them. (Bauman &
Döring, 2011, p. 736)
Lee and Lim (2009) measured autonomy with three items:
"I always complete everything I initiate. I am always posi-
tive about problems arising in my life, and solve them on my
own. Even if I fail many times, I will keep on trying until I
succeed on this business" (p. 9). If we use this type of mea-
sure, our coauthor/entrepreneur could be considered as being
autonomous. She maintained autonomous capacities, but in
this context, she was not fully autonomous. According to
St Jean and Audet (2012), mentors have to adopt a maieutic
style rather than a directive style. In this case, the mentored
retain their autonomy. "A situation that threatens persons'
self-view, the view others have of them, and/or the quality of
their relationships and interpersonal exchanges, may dimin-
ish their sense of self-esteem and self-efficacy" (Pierce,
Baldwin, & Lydon, 1997, p. 29). "Self-belief does not neces-
sarily ensure success, but self-disbelief assuredly spawns
failure" (Bandura, 1997, p. 77). Self-doubt prevents the
skillful use of skills already established. If self-efficacy is
lacking, people tend to behave ineffectually, even though
they know what to do (Bandura, 1997).
Such a situation may lead to dependence and incapacity to
act. Support may therefore incapacitate a person and have
the opposite effect than intended. Support meant to increase
efficiency often supposes an equal relationship between the
entrepreneur and the person offering support, where solu-
tions can be co-constructed. Co-construction does not lead to
a perception of inferiority and takes into account what is very
important to the entrepreneur (in our case, her project).
Williams (1995) focuses on the importance of the need and
the wish to have a reciprocal relationship between support
and recipient. Figure 1 shows how seeking help, feeling
weak, and influencing autonomy can interact and induce
dependence and loss of the entrepreneur's capacities.
Conclusion
The purpose of this article was to examine the transformation
process of a specific entrepreneur, from autonomy to per-
ceived dependence. We explained how support may decrease
autonomy and develop dependence in entrepreneurs. An
unequal relationship between an entrepreneur who needs
help and a support person who gives advice may have a very
negative impact on entrepreneurs (and their business).
Coaches and mentors should work toward the co-construc-
tion of solutions (the entrepreneur and the support person) to
be more productive and avoid a possibly very negative pro-
cess. However, entrepreneurs who face difficulties and need
help can easily get support from consultants who hand out
ready-made solutions, although this may indeed lead to fur-
ther difficulties.
