Mortality Attributable to Cholestatic Liver Disease in
the United States
Flavia D. Mendes,1 W. Ray Kim,2 Rachel Pedersen,3 Terry Therneau,3 and Keith D. Lindor2
In the past 2 decades, important advances have been made in the treatment of cholestatic
liver diseases, including primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis
(PSC). Whether these new therapies have had demonstrable impact on mortality on a
population-wide scale has not been evaluated. This study describes the age-specific and
sex-specific mortality rates from PBC and PSC in the United States between 1980 and 1998,
based on the Multiple Cause of Death files. Age-specific and sex- specific mortality rates from
PBC and PSC were calculated. The multivariable Poisson model was used to evaluate
temporal changes in mortality rates. In 1998, the total age-adjusted and sex-adjusted PBC-
related mortality rate was 0.24 per 100,000, and the age-adjusted and sex-adjusted PSC-
related mortality rate was 0.23 per 100,000. During the observation period, PBC-related
mortality significantly decreased over time in women younger than 65 years, and in men of
all age groups, whereas in older women this number increased over time. PSC-related
mortality remained essentially stable, except in men 65 years of age or older. Conclusion:
Since the early 1980s, significant changes in mortality from PBC have occurred. The most
noticeable change was an increase in the age of death, which indicates prolongation of
survival. These changes may be attributable to liver transplantation or ursodeoxycholic acid.
In contrast, mortality from PSC remained largely unchanged, highlighting the need for more
effective therapeutic strategies. (HEPATOLOGY 2008;47:1241-1247.)
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary scleros-
ing cholangitis (PSC) are chronic cholestatic disor-
ders of the liver. PBC is characterized histologically
by portal inflammation and immune-mediated destruc-
tion of the intrahepatic bile ducts and serologically by the
presence of antimitochondrial antibodies.1 PSC is charac-
terized by progressive destruction of intrahepatic and ex-
trahepatic bile ducts.2
PBC is a disease that affects primarily women, in a 9:1
ratio. The median age of diagnosis is 50 years (range,
20-90 years).1,3 In the first population-based study in the
United States, Kim et al.4 reported an incidence of PBC of
2.7 per 100,000 person-years and a prevalence of 40.2 per
100,000 persons. Based on these data, it was estimated
that there would be 47,000 prevalent cases of PBC in the
US white population and that approximately 3,500 new
cases would be diagnosed each year.4 The overall median
survival ranges between 10 and 15 years, with disease
progression being more likely in patients with symptom-
atic disease, even though asymptomatic patients still have
a lower overall median survival compared with an age-
matched and sex-matched healthy population.1,3 In a
study by Prince et al.,5 only one-third of the deaths in
asymptomatic patients with PBC were liver related. Sev-
eral reports demonstrate an increased risk of hepatocellu-
lar carcinoma in patients with PBC; however, the crude
frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma is still low at 0.7%
to 3.6% (5.9%-11.1% in patients with advanced PBC).6-8
Although the incidence of PBC in the United States
has not changed for the past 20 years,4 at least 2 therapeu-
tic modalities have been shown to be effective in treating
patients with PBC. These include orthotopic liver trans-
plantation (OLT) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).
Liver transplantation, shown to improve survival of pa-
tients with end-stage liver disease from PBC,9 has been
used widely in PBC patients since the mid-1980s. UDCA

therapy slows disease progression and reduces the need for
liver transplantation in patients with PBC.10 It was ap-
proved in the United States for PBC in 1997, although its
effectiveness had been reported in the literature as early as
1991.11 With these significant advances in the treatment
of PBC, improvement in survival of patients with PBC is
expected. However, such impact on PBC-related mortal-
ity has not been evaluated on a population-wide scale.
PSC affects men more commonly than women, and
the median age of diagnosis is approximately 40 years.
The median survival is 12 years from diagnosis. Its asso-
ciation with inflammatory bowel disease is well known.2
In a US population-based study, the estimated overall
age-adjusted and sex- adjusted incidence of PSC was 0.90
per 100,000 person-years (1.25 in men and 0.54 in
women), and the prevalence was 13.6 per 100,000 (20.9
men and 6.3 women). In this study, the estimated 10-year
survival of patients with PSC was 65%, compared with an
expected survival of 94%.12 Cholangiocarcinoma is the
most feared complication and occurs in 7%-15% of pa-
tients with PSC, with an annual incidence of 0.5% to 1%.
Liver transplantation has achieved overall excellent
outcomes, including long-term survival and improve-
ment in quality of life in patients with advanced PSC.13
However, PSC tends to recur in the allograft, which
sometimes leads to graft failure, retransplantation, or
death.14 Furthermore, no medical treatment has been
shown effective in slowing disease progression or time to
liver transplantation in patients with PSC.15 In practice,
however, UDCA may be being used off label, although its
efficacy in patients with PSC has not been demonstrat-
ed.16
In this study, we used detailed death certificate data to
describe the age-specific mortality rates from PBC and
PSC in the United States between the years of 1980 and
1998 and to evaluate their time trends. The comparison
between PBC and PSC provides helpful insight into the
impact of advances in therapy for these diseases over time.
Patients and Methods
Data Source. Data on mortality were obtained from
the Multiple Cause of Death files, which comprise all
death certificates issued in the United States (approxi-
mately 2 million annually). Data on all calendar years
between 1980 and 1998 were obtained from the National
Center for Health Statistics (Hyattsville, MD). Available
data elements included age (in 5-year increments), sex,
race (white, African, and other), and place of birth and
death, and all listed (immediate, contributing, and under-
lying) causes of death on the death certificate.
The timeframe of analysis (1980-1998) was chosen
because the diagnostic coding system used for the data was
consistent during the period; the coding system was
changed to the International Classification of Diseases
10th version (ICD-10) in 1999.
Case Ascertainment. The Multiple Causes of Death
files used the International Classification of Diseases 9th
version (ICD-9) for diagnostic coding. Death records
with a PBC diagnosis was identified with the code 5716
(biliary cirrhosis), whereas the code 5761 (sclerosing
cholangitis) was used for PSC deaths. We considered a
death PBC-related or PSC-related if either diagnosis was
listed as the "underlying" or "immediate" cause of death
or "underlying/immediate" cause of death was cirrhosis,
portal hypertension and its complications (esophageal
varices, ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic coma),
hepatocellular carcinoma/cholangiocarcinoma, acute
liver failure, or unspecified disorder of liver, and PBC or
PSC was also listed as a contributing cause of death.
Records in which PBC or PSC was listed but the imme-
diate or underlying cause of death was not liver related
were thought to represent deaths in which PBC or PSC
was incidental and did not contribute to the death.
Data Analysis. Data from the Multiple Cause of
Death file were analyzed using SAS version 8.2 (SAS In-
stitute Inc., Cary, NC). Mortality rates, namely incidence
rates of deaths, attributable to PBC or PSC were calcu-
lated, considering the entire population of the United
States to be at risk. Denominator age-specific, sex-spe-
cific, and race-specific person-years were based on the
2000 census. For the estimation of data variability, we
assumed that, given a fixed number of person-years, the
number of cases would follow a Poisson distribution,
which allowed the estimation of standard errors and the
calculation of 95% confidence intervals for the mortality
rates. Because there were only a small number of dece-
dents of nonwhite race, all races were combined in the
estimation of mortality rates and subsequent analyses.
Also, only those deaths in which the age was 20 years or
older were included in the analysis.
The impact of age, sex, and calendar year was examined
using the generalized linear model assuming a Poisson
error structure. In the Poisson analysis modeling, both
PBC-related death and PSC-related death, the natural log
of the national population for a given age/sex combina-
tion was used as an offset. Thus, all models are age-ad-
justed and sex-adjusted to the national population.
Interactions among these variables were examined to de-
fine whether there were differences in the temporal trend
in incidence rates of PBC-related and PSC-related death
across sex.

Results
Deaths of PBC and PSC. A total of 11,860 records
of potential PBC-related deaths were found in the Multi-
ple Cause of Death file, but only 7,913 (67%) met our
definition of PBC-related death and were included in the
analysis. Of those, 6,414 (81.1%) were women, and
1,499 (18.9%) were men. The mean age at death was 65.6
(13.9) years. Most were of white race (93.7%). African-
Americans accounted for 4.5%; others, which included
Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, and Alaskan, for
1.7% (Table 1).
A total of 23,985 records of potential PSC-related
deaths were found in the Multiple Cause of Death file,
but only 8,081(34%) met our definition of PSC-related
death and were included in the analysis. Of those, 4,159
(51.5%) were men, and 3,922 (48.5%) were women. The
mean age at death was 68.8 (16.2). Most were of white
race (88.4%), African-Americans accounted for 8.4%,
and others, which included Asian, Pacific Islander, Native
American, and Alaskan, for 3.2% (Table 1).
The total age-adjusted PBC-related mortality in 1998
was 0.241 per 100,000. As expected, PBC mortality was
much higher in women (0.365 per 100,000) than in men
(0.082 per 100,000). In contrast, mortality attributable to
PSC was higher in men (0.271 per 100,000) than in
women (0.186 per 100,000), with the sex difference being
much less dramatic with PSC than with PBC. The total
age-adjusted PSC-related mortality in 1998 was 0.226 per
100,000.
Time Trends in PBC-Related and PSC-Related
Mortality. Figure 1 illustrates age-specific mortality for
women and men for representative calendar years (1980,
1986, 1992, and 1998). In general, mortality from PBC
increased with age in both sexes. In women, PBC mortal-
ity in the 1980s had a bimodal pattern, with a first peak in
the late 50s and early 60s and the second rise in the 70s.
Into the 1990s, the first peak disappeared, giving rise to a
pattern of uniform increase with age. PBC mortality in
men did not show a consistent pattern, in part because of
the fewer number of deaths. Figure 2 displays the same
information for PSC mortality. Mortality attributable to
PSC also increased with age. There did not seem to be any
longitudinal pattern to PSC mortality in men or women.
Trend in mortality is further analyzed in Figs. 3 and 4,
which show mortality rates by calendar year. Figure 3
demonstrates that in women between 40 and 64 years of
age, death attributable to PBC decreased from 0.4 per
100,000 in 1980 to 0.2 per 100,000 in 1998. In contrast,
in women in the older age group (65 years), the rate
increased over time from 0.93 per 100,000 in 1980 to
1.48 per 100,000 in 1998. In the youngest age group, the

low mortality rate makes it difficult to appreciate a trend
graphically; however, the Poisson model also showed a
decrease over time (see later discussion). In men 40 to 64
years of age, the PBC death rate decreased from 0.1 per
100,000 in 1980 to 0.03 per 100,000 in 1998. Mortality
rates also decreased in men of the other age groups.
With regard to PSC, Fig. 4 shows that the death rate in
men older than 65 years of age decreased over time from
1.5 per 100,000 in 1980 to 0.93 per 100,000 in 1998. In
men of the other age groups, PSC mortality did not
change over time. In women, there was no discernible
trend in PSC mortality.
These findings were formally examined in Poisson re-
gression models, shown in Tables 2 (PBC) and 3 (PSC).
The mortality rate ratio (MRR) calculation showed that
PBC mortality in women increased with age. For exam-
ple, PBC mortality in women older than 65 years was
1.77 times higher than that in women aged 40 to 64 years
(1.77  1/MRR, MRR  0.56), and 41.7 times higher
than that in women aged 20 to 39 years (41.7  1/MRR,
MRR  0.024). With regard to a time trend, in women
older than 65 years of age, each decade in calendar year
was associated with a 29% increase in PBC mortality,
whereas in younger women, the mortality rate decreased
by approximately half (MRR  0.53). In men, as in
women, PBC mortality increased with age. PBC mortal-
ity in men showed a significant reduction over time, re-
gardless of their age, although the decrease was more
pronounced in the 40 to 64 and 20 to 39 age groups
(MRR  0.42 and 0.48, respectively) than in the older
counterpart (MRR  0.78).
Mortality attributable to PSC also increased signifi-
cantly with age in both men and women. Overall, there
was much less noticeable calendar year effect in PSC mor-
tality. The model did show that the PSC mortality de-
creased significantly in women between 40 and 64 years of
age and men older than 65 years. However, the effect size
was small (0.85 for the former and 0.90 for the latter).
Discussion
Several epidemiological factors may contribute to
changes in mortality rates of a given disease. First, if the
disease incidence changes, morbidity and mortality sec-
ondary to the disease will be affected accordingly. In the
case of PBC and PSC, there is no firm evidence that their
incidence has changed over time.4,12 Second, if there is a
shift in disease severity affecting the case fatality rate, mor-
tality rates in the population may change, even if the
incidence remains the same. Third, similarly, if there is
effective treatment that alters survival of patients, it may
alter mortality rates. In the case of cholestatic liver dis-
eases, therapeutic modalities that may have affected mor-
tality rates on the population level include liver
transplantation and UDCA.
Liver transplantation has been widely used since the
mid-1980s, and it has been shown to be an effective treat-
ment for end-stage liver disease caused by both PBC and
PSC, with excellent outcomes reported. Survival after
liver transplantation for PBC are on the order of 85%-
90% and 70%-80% after 1 and 5 years,17 respectively,
and for PSC, reported 1-year and 5-year survival rates are
as high as 94% and 86%, respectively.18
UDCA has been shown in randomized controlled tri-
als to delay disease progression and to improve survival
free of liver transplantation in patients with PBC, espe-
cially for those started on treatment while early-stage dis-
ease is present.10,19-24 UDCA also has been actively
studied for the treatment of PSC; however, no effect on
delaying disease progression or the need for liver trans-
plantation has been shown,25 and further studies are on-

going, looking at the effects of high-dose UDCA in these
patients.
Because the incidence of PBC in the United States has
remained stable for the past 20 years,4 the trend observed
in PBC-related mortality suggests that there was a bene-
ficial effect of both OLT and UDCA. The mortality
change observed in the mid-1980s is probably attribut-
able to the more widespread use of liver transplantation.
The stronger effect noted in younger women may be ex-
plained by the fact that younger patients are more likely to
undergo liver transplantation. One may speculate that the
increased mortality observed in older women could rep-
resent an effect of UDCA on delaying disease progression;
however, because disease progresses at an older age, these
patients may be less likely to benefit from liver transplan-
tation. However, UDCA's effect might be more readily
determined in a future study that looks at similar rates in
the decade after its approval and more widespread use
(1999-2009).
Interpretation of data on PSC is more difficult than
that for PBC. In spite of the significant P-values in the
Poisson models, inspection of Figs. 3 and 4 shows that the
curves for PSC are largely flat over time. The less pro-
nounced time trend on PSC-related mortality may repre-
sent the lack of medical treatment that is able to impact on
disease progression. Another possible explanation is the
fact that the death certificate data for sclerosing cholangi-
tis include an unknown proportion of non-PSC cases.
Potential scenarios of secondary sclerosing cholangitis
that may be included in the data are cases of bile duct
complications after surgery of the gallbladder or bile ducts
and those of cholangiocarcinoma occurring in non-PSC
patients. Because of the rapid adoption of laparoscopic
surgery during the 1980s and 1990s, there may have been

an increased incidence of secondary sclerosing cholangi-
tis, which may in part explain the high proportion of
PSC-related deaths in women, not in keeping with the
male preponderance of the disease. Mortality from those
patients may have obscured a reduction in mortality in
patients with PSC, for example, secondary to OLT. Con-
versely, cholangiocarcinoma occurring in older patients
without PSC may have been erroneously classified as PSC
in the past, which may occur less frequently as diagnostic
accuracy improves over time. This may have produced a
trend in the reduction of mortality in the older age group.
One may note a noticeable discrepancy between the
estimated number of incident cases (for example, 3,500
new PBC cases per year among white Americans4) versus
the number of deaths reported here (for example, 470
PBC deaths per year on average). There may be several
explanations for this gap between the incidence and mor-
tality for PBC and PSC. First, there are patients with
asymptomatic disease that remains undiagnosed at the
time of death. The frequency with which this occurs may
not be estimated based on currently available data. Sec-
ond, it is well known that even patients with symptomatic
PBC do not die of liver-related causes. According to
Prince et al.,5 31% and 57% of deaths in PBC patients are
liver related in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients,
respectively. In the current data, 7,913 of 11,860 deaths
(67%) in subjects with a PBC diagnosis were determined
to be liver related. Clearly, not all patients with PBC die of
it, and death certificates of decedents who had PBC but
did not die of it may lack the PBC diagnosis. Third, the
Olmsted County population from which the estimates for
PBC and PSC incidence was derived was predominantly
of Scandinavian descent, the geographic area with the
highest reported incidence of PBC.26 Finally, the death
certificate data entail inaccuracies, and relevant deaths
may have been omitted or misclassified.27 As pointed out
earlier, this bias is likely greater for PSC deaths. In sum-
mary, the impression that the death rate for PBC/PSC
appears to be only a fraction of their estimated incidence
is likely a result of several factors, including lack of diag-
nosis, deaths of causes unrelated to their liver disease, and
geographic heterogeneity of the US population. It is likely
that there is some underestimation in our data (that is,
death certificate diagnosis) of the true mortality of liver-
related causes with diagnosed PBC and PSC. The magni-
tude of this underestimation remains unknown, and it
represents the main limitation of this study. However, it
must be pointed out that the main focus of the study is the
time trend in mortality, not necessarily the absolute num-
ber of deaths. Thus, as long as this underestimation re-
mains consistent over time, we believe that our
observation about the trend is valid.
The trend in the population-wide outcome of PBC
and PSC observed in this study was recently corroborated

by a study by Lee et al.,28 in which all patients who were
registered or who underwent transplantation in the
United States between 1995 and 2006 were analyzed.
Their data are in support of this study in 2 ways. First,
similar to our observation, there was a statistically signif-
icant decrease in the number of patients wait-listed for
PBC over time, whereas no such trend was seen with PSC.
Second, the average number of patients wait-listed for
PBC and PSC in the United States was 368 and 465 per
year, respectively. These numbers are similar to the num-
ber of deaths observed in this study, which indicate that
our death certificate data are unlikely to be inaccurate by
a large measure.
In conclusion, over a nearly 2-decade period, signifi-
cant changes in mortality were observed, the most pro-
nounced of which was the decreased mortality observed in
younger women (65 years old) with PBC. We postulate
that these trends are attributable to advances in the treat-
ment of cholestatic liver diseases with the advent of OLT
and UDCA for the treatment of PBC. In contrast, the
increased mortality in older women with PBC points to
the fact that those treatment modalities are not curative.
Mortality trends in PSC in general are less discernible,
which may indicate lack of effective treatment options for
patients with PSC.
