Introduction
Production outsourcing networks and vertically integrated
firms account for two important forms of organizing produc-
tion. The former have acquired increasing importance in
some developed countries'industry and are currently spread-
ing to developing countries (EIM & IKEI, 2009; Kakabadse
& Kakabadse, 2002).
The literature has emphasized the possible advantages
accruing to subcontractors who participate in production
outsourcing networks (e.g., transfers of technology;
Amesse, Dragoste, Nollet, & Ponce, 2001; Innocenti &
Labory, 2004; Lehtinen, 1999; Morris & Imrie, 1993;
Podolny & Page, 1998). A review of the literature con-
cludes that "the vast majority of the evidence analysed is
overall extremely positive about the value of business-to-
business networks and their impact on the innovation pro-
cess" (Pittaway, Robertson, Munir, Denyer, & Neely, 2004,
p. 158). It has also been claimed that, in some industries,
networks yield greater economic welfare than vertical inte-
gration as contractors may share the capacity of different
suppliers, promoting savings of overall investment costs
(Kranton & Minehart, 2000). These research findings may
have contributed to the existence of what Grandori (1999)
calls "a general widespread pro-network bias" among aca-
demics, international organizations, and policy makers (p. 2).
Policies have encouraged subcontracting in countries such
as Italy, Ireland, Korea, Malaysia, and the United States
(Negrelli 2004; Podolny & Page, 1998; United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], 2001).
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization
(UNIDO, 2003) has promoted subcontracting partnerships
to help small and medium-sized subcontractors in develop-
ing countries and economies in transition.
However, it is difficult to assess whether engagement in
production outsourcing networks also accrues some advan-
tages to contractors (outsourcers or clients). With some
exceptions (see, for instance, Bengtsson, 2008), systematic

Is the Pro-Network Bias Justified?
Outsourcers, Small Batch Production, and
Advanced Manufacturing Technology
Rafael Pardo1 and Ruth Rama2
Abstract
The academic literature, policy makers, and international organizations often emphasize the value of networks that, allegedly,
may contribute to subcontractor upgrading, innovation, and economic welfare. By contrast, it is difficult to assess whether
engagement in production outsourcing networks also accrues some advantages to outsourcers (contractors). To research
differences between these organizations and vertically integrated organizations, we analyzed a sample of 1,031 industrial
plants, statistically representative of firms with more than 50 employees in Spain's manufacturing industry. We used t-tests,
nonparametric tests, and chi-square tests, and hypotheses were tested for three subsets of companies, classified by the R&D
intensity of the industry. In each set of industries, subcontracting is systematically associated with small batch production.
By contrast, vertically integrated plants are more inclined to use mass production. In every type of industry, subcontracting
is a form of governance especially efficient for the diffusion of new technology. Plants that subcontract production are more
likely than integrated plants to adopt advanced manufacturing technology, whatever the R&D intensity of the industry. We
conclude that outsourcers seem better prepared than vertically integrated organizations to meet customers' requirements
but employment of subcontracting do not lower necessarily their technology needs--a widespread "pro-network" argument.

research into the differences between companies engaged in
production networks, that is outsourcers, and nonoutsourc-
ers, remains scarce.
An important issue is whether outsourcers are more likely
than nonoutsourcers to adopt advanced technology. One rea-
son why companies outsource production appears to be, after
all, to avoid investment in expensive equipment (Berggren &
Bengtsson, 2004; De Propris, 2001). So far, the debate on
this subject has left a practical question unanswered: Is sub-
contracting superior to other forms of corporate governance
in promoting the adoption of new manufacturing technology
in the industry? Furthermore, output flexibility, a trait the lit-
erature often associates with production networks, has rarely
been studied in its general dimension. The alleged shift
toward flexible production has largely been analyzed within
local production systems (Becattini, 2002; De Propris, 2001;
Paniccia, 1998; Storper & Harrison, 1991). Given the
increasing popularity of offshoring and extraregional pro-
duction networks (Hagedoorn, 1994; Hätönen & Eriksson,
2009; Holl & Rama, 2009; Mol, van Tulder, & Beije, 2005;
Razzolini & Vannoni, 2011; Sturgeon, 2002), it would be
useful to understand more clearly whether firms that choose
vertical disintegration have more chances to improve their
output flexibility, whatever their partner's location. Lack of
consensus on such questions is partly due to insufficient
large-scale analyses.
While the empirical literature in this field has provided
important analyses, it has been mainly concerned with case
studies, rarely offering systematic evidence. The few large-
scale studies on subcontracting are often at the industry (not
at the industrial plant) level (see, for instance, Díaz-Mora,
2008; Mol, 2005). There is still a considerable dearth of sta-
tistical analyses to complement such research and provide a
broader picture of the phenomenon. Second, most of the
models of industries that rely on external economies have
been built on examples taken from Japan, Italy, and Germany
and have concentrated on specific sectors, such as automo-
biles, within these countries (Sturgeon, 2002). Analyses of
national industries (and sectors) other than those tradition-
ally studied by previous researchers may help to draw a more
accurate picture of the so-called new paradigm for industrial
organization.
To summarize, more research supported by large represen-
tative samples and standardized measurements is necessary to
overcome the limitations of previous studies confined to cer-
tain countries, regional samples, and a limited selection of
industries. A better understanding of these aspects may con-
tribute to the formulation of informed industrial policies.
To study differences between outsourcers and nonout-
sourcers, we analyze data taken from a plant-level survey of
Spanish industrial firms conducted in 2003. We compare
these industrial plants to understand better if those that prefer
disintegration are (a) better prepared to customize produc-
tion and (b) have a potential to adopt new manufacturing
technology. We also try to understand (c) if subcontracting
enables industrial plants to reduce their equipment require-
ments, compared with vertically integrated plants. The total
sample included 1,031 industrial plants (hereafter, plants).
Given size, sector, and geographic location, our sample is
representative of Spain's manufacturing plants with more
than 50 employees. In 2007, following Germany, France, and
Italy, Spain hosted the largest subcontracting industry in the
EU-15, in terms of turnover associated with manufacturing
subcontractor activity (EIM & IKEI, 2009), hence the inter-
est in analyzing the Spanish case.
The section "Theoretical Background and Hypotheses"
provides a review of the literature and proposes our hypoth-
eses. The section "Data" describes the data used in the
empirical analysis. The "Results" section tests for differ-
ences between outsourcers (production networks) and non-
outsourcers. The section "Discussion" discusses the results
and the section "Conclusion" offers some conclusions.
Theoretical Background and
Hypotheses
There is no standard definition of outsourcing (hereafter, we
use the terms outsourcing and subcontracting). Most authors,
however, stress that subcontracting differs from mere market
transactions of readymade parts/components in that products
supplied by subcontractors (suppliers) are based on specifi-
cations (quality, design, etc.) issued by the outsourcer (client
or contractor; Andersen, 1999; Bala Subrahmanyan, 2008;
Díaz-Mora, 2008; Gilley & Rasheed, 2000).
We define production outsourcing as an arrangement in
which a company (the outsourcer) requests from another
independent firm (the subcontractor) the supply of an input
or of parts and components; these must be manufactured
according to the outsourcer's specifications. We focus only
on subcontracting that involves legally distinct industrial
establishments (not within-company subcontracting), and
on outsourcing of tangible materials and components (not of
services). The term outsourcing has also been used in a pur-
chasing perspective in trade studies, international business
(IB) studies, and part of the management literature (Rama &
Holl, 2013). This perspective sees outsourcing as trade in
parts, components, and tasks deriving from the fragmenta-
tion of (national or international) production, whatever rela-
tionships exist between the buyer and the supplier.
"Outsourcing" practices analyzed by this line of research
often consist of the purchase of a noncustomized input
through a spot market transaction (Spencer, 2005). In this
sense, obviously, all companies "outsource" some produc-
tion. However, we adhere here to the organizations and busi-
ness alliances literature, and define outsourcing as an
arrangement that involves collaboration between the con-
tractor and the subcontractor. In this sense, not all firms (or
plants) are outsourcers.
According to Kranton and Minehart (2000), in a market
where manufacturers and suppliers have no relationship,
Pardo and Rama 3
only standardized inputs are marketed; at the same time, ver-
tically integrated manufacturers obtain their specialized
inputs from their own plants. In practice, firms outsource
some activities and integrate others. Moreover, a firm may
produce in-house and buy (or subcontract) the same product
(Parmigiani, 2007). Companies or plants may seek collabo-
ration along different stages of the value chain (vertical sub-
contracting) or in the same stage in an industry to expand
their product mix (horizontal subcontracting). In practice,
they often combine both arrangements.
Research into outsourcing stems from various roots, such
as organizational theory and network theory (Hätönen &
Eriksson, 2009; Ritter & Gemünden, 2003). Academics may
use terms such as subcontracting networks or production
networks for contracting out relationships involving collabo-
ration. However, it should be stressed that subcontracting
networks are only a specific case of networks (Sacchetti &
Sudgen, 2003).
Though many types of flexibility definitions have been
recognized in the literature (see, for instance, De Propris,
2001; Morroni, 1991; Parthasarthy & Sethi, 1992; Vokurka
& O'Leary-Kelly, 2000), we focus here on output flexibility
and, more specifically, on the ability of the plant to produce
small batches and customized items. In the literature, pro-
duction processes centered on small batch production, niche
markets, and customization are often defined as flexible pro-
duction systems. For Parthasarthy and Sethi (1992), compet-
ing in a market based on product mix or customization is an
important aspect of scope flexibility. According to von
Tunzelmann (1995) "flexibility comes from the alleged abil-
ity to redesign products very rapidly in response to perceived
market forces" (p. 263). Other authors see the ability to
change quickly between products as one form of manufactur-
ing flexibility (Upton, 1995). Naturally, these definitions are
related.
Some studies associate the mass production of standard-
ized goods (hereafter, mass production) channeled to large
homogeneous markets with vertically integrated firms, and
small batch production with production networks (Bessant &
Haywood, 1988; De Propris, 2001; Larsson, 1999). However,
this thesis has mainly been tested for local production net-
works (Becattini, 2002; De Propris, 2001; Paniccia, 1998;
Storper & Harrison, 1991); hence, the criticism of those who
claim that flexible production phenomena are likely to be
confined to specific regional locations (Coffey & Bailly,
1991). Though geographic proximity can certainly facilitate
networking, case studies suggest that firms can also seek
flexibility through subcontracting relationships with spa-
tially decentralized suppliers (see, for instance, Echeverri-
Carroll, 1996; Lane & Probert, 2005).
We hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Outsourcers are more likely than non-
outsourcers to engage in small batch production.
We investigate if this applies also to outsourcers who
mainly subcontract production in foreign countries (interna-
tional outsourcing). This thesis has rarely been put to test
with large-scale samples of a national manufacturing indus-
try. This is a contribution of our article.
Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT) enables
manufacturing plants to switch cheaply from one task to
another and produce small batches of customized items.
Zammuto and O'Connor (1992) define AMT as "a family of
technologies that include computer-assisted design and engi-
neering systems, materials resource planning systems, auto-
mated materials handling systems, robotics, computer
numerically controlled machines, flexible manufacturing
systems, and computer-integrated manufacturing systems"
(p. 701). For a list of AMT analyzed in this article, see
Appendix A.
While some authors see a positive association between
outsourcing practices and the use of AMT, others suggest the
relationship is negative. The latter statement is justified
because firms may allegedly reduce their investment require-
ments by outsourcing production (see, for instance, Berggren
& Bengtsson, 2004; Ghisi & Martinelli, 2006; Gilley &
Rasheed, 2000; Havnes & Senneseth, 2001; Hertz, 1992;
Pittaway et al., 2004). Network theory and the industrial dis-
trict literature often consider subcontracting arrangements to
be a solution to firms' problems, such as resource scarcity
(see, for instance, Berggren & Bengtsson, 2004; Ghisi &
Martinelli, 2006; Havnes & Senneseth, 2001; Hertz, 1992).
Insufficient capital is one such resource shortage, and, via
subcontracting, runs the argument, companies are able to
quickly increase their output without incurring additional
capital investment. The management literature also consid-
ers that outsourcers may be able "to take advantage of emerg-
ing technology without investing significant amounts of
capital in that technology" (Gilley & Rasheed, 2000, p. 766).
This would increase the technology-related flexibility of
firms, especially when production technology changes
quickly or when technological changes are difficult to pre-
dict (Gilley & Rasheed, 2000).
This point of view has received some empirical support.
Subcontracting seems to have allowed French small and
medium sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in the engineer-
ing industry to avoid investment in up-to-date machine tools
and, often, reduce capacity (Lorenz, 2000). In a period of
slow growth and uncertain markets (in the early 1980s), this
author claims, it would have been impossible for these small
contractors to amortize investments. They were able to do so,
he argues, because subcontractors could aggregate the
demand of several clients. A similar argument is defended
by Sturgeon (2002) concerning the U.S. high-tech industry.
In outsourcing of modules, he claims, suppliers rather than
outsourcers (client firms) play a leading technological role,
an arrangement that may reduce outsourcers' needs for
manufacturing technology. According to this author, these
4 SAGE Open
contractors may be able to increase volume without install-
ing additional in-house equipment, as "turn-keys" suppliers
can offer external economies of scope. From the French and
the U.S. studies, it might be deduced that contractors (out-
sourcers) may have less need for manufacturing assets than
nonoutsourcers of the same sector.
By contrast, other academics believe that information and
communication technology (ICT), an important element of
AMT, is contributing to a shift from the old integrated firm
toward production networks (see, for instance, Acemoglu,
Ahion, Griffith, & Zilibotti, 2007). The literature on business
networks suggests that ICT is an important ingredient in inter-
firm relationships (Grandori & Soda, 1995). Milgrom and
Roberts (1990) argue that adopters of AMT tend to interrelate
closely with their suppliers. This stream of literature offers
two principal explanations for why firms presumably com-
bine participation in production networks and the utilization
of AMT. First, ICT facilitates interfirm linkages by reducing
coordination costs. Rapid and reliable communication on a
day-to-day basis is crucial to ensure continuous coordination
between outsourcers and their suppliers (Giunta & Trivieri,
2007; Larsson, 1999). Second, advanced manufacturing and
design technology (another type of AMT) may facilitate vari-
ety-based production by reducing design and manufacturing
costs. As stated, previous research suggests that outsourcers
are likely to specialize in customized production.
However, the empirical evidence on the possible associa-
tion between production networks and company use of AMT
is inconclusive. One study finds that the fragmentation of
production is slowing down the spread of ICT among Italian
SMEs (Giunta & Trivieri, 2007). Milgrom and Roberts
(1990) offer a convincing account of why outsourcers use
AMT, but do not supply empirical evidence to support their
theory. As Bocquet, Brossard, and Sabatier (2007) note, most
previous studies have confined such analysis to computers
and automation tools. Other studies, by contrast, have
focused exclusively on ICT and find associations only in cer-
tain cases (e.g., in high-performing companies; Bocquet
et al., 2007; Whittington, Pettigrew, Peck, Fenton, & Conyon,
1999). It is difficult to determine from previous research
whether subcontracting is associated with AMT in general.
Klein (2005) contends that, in analyses of contractual rela-
tionships and integrated firms, alternate hypotheses should
be tested as, in this field, rival explanations are quite
common.
Therefore, we put to test two alternate hypotheses:
Hypothesis 2a (H2a): Outsourcers are more likely to uti-
lize AMT in the industrial plant.
Hypothesis 2b (H2b): Outsourcers are less likely to use
AMT in the industrial plant.
We test for association rather than for causality between
these factors. The principal body of organization theory
assumes that decisions concerning organizational form and
technology are simultaneously adopted by the firm (Madhok,
1996; Milgrom & Roberts, 1990; Williamson, 1991). In line
with other empirical studies in the field (Whittington et al.,
1999), we adhere to this theory, which implies association
rather than causality between company adoption ofAMT and
engagement in production networks. A contribution of our
article is that we analyze the relationships between subcon-
tracting and a complete series of different types of AMT (not
exclusively ICT) in companies operating in three different
industrial classes.
As stated, previous research has argued that AMT may
facilitate variety-based production by reducing design and
manufacturing costs at the plant level. This view suggests
that the reasons why outsourcers adopt AMT are to be sought
in their production strategy, that is, production of small
batches and customized items. The question left unanswered,
however, is whether it is the type of production (rather than
the type of organization) that is associated with the plant
adoption of AMT. To our knowledge, previous literature has
not tackled this question.
A review of the operations management literature finds
that although conventional wisdom has it that use of AMT is
related to manufacturing flexibility (including new designs,
range of products, and volume flexibility), the results of
empirical studies are in fact counterintuitive (Vokurka &
O'Leary-Kelly, 2000). These studies "are almost unanimous
that AMT was not associated with an increase in manufactur-
ing flexibility and, in some cases, was found to be associated
with a decrease in flexibility" (p. 492). A possible reason for
the findings, these authors claim, is the unavailability of
managerial skills required to implement AMT at the plant
level.
We argue that engagement in production networks may
boost certain managerial skills that facilitate the adoption of
AMT. When a firm acquires new generation technology it
needs to possess in-house capabilities to cooperate and nego-
tiate with suppliers of capital goods and systems (Flowers,
2007). The adoption ofAMT requires complementary invest-
ments and learning, such as reskilling of the workforce; com-
pared with standard machines, AMT technology implies
higher costs of adoption, rather than lower ones (Hall, 2005).
Moreover, as noted by Meccheri and Morroni (2010), "out-
sourcing entails the development of internal capabilities to
bargain" (p. 81). In our view, outsourcers may be better pre-
pared to face the sunk costs involved in successful AMT
adoption. They are more likely than nonoutsourcers to have
developed such in-house capabilities, given their experience
in managing partnerships and their greater propensity to
undertake R&D (Mol, 2005).
Therefore, we propose the following:
Hypothesis 3 (H3): The implementation of small batch
and customized item production tends to be signifi-
cantly associated with the adoption of AMT only in
outsourcers (not in nonoutsourcers).
Pardo and Rama 5
Data
The Survey
A review of the literature on manufacturing flexibility and
AMT adoption strongly advises to use the industrial plant
as a unit of analysis in empirical analyses (Vokurka &
O'Leary-Kelly, 2000). The data used in the following anal-
ysis were obtained from a plant-level survey targeting
plants in Spain's manufacturing industry and conducted in
2003. To establish the dimension of the population of plants
in terms of sector, region, and size, we used the information
contained in the Central Directory of Enterprises (DIRCE),
compiled by the National Institute of Statistics. To select
the sample, the distribution of plants indicated by the
DIRCE was taken into account. Regions are the 17 Spanish
Autonomous Communities; including peninsular Spain, the
Canary Islands, and the Balearic Islands. Sectors were
defined according to the CNAE classification (National
Classification of Economic Activities), similar to the
European NACE rev1, and include all the Spanish manu-
facturing industry (26 industries). We selected companies
for analysis from the Dun & Bradstreet Spain list. Before
fieldwork started, the initial list was depurated: 312 plants
had less than 50 employees because they had reduced their
working force after the publication of their data and 216
displayed unreliable contact information. 2,209 plants were
contacted and the obtained response rate was 47%, giving a
final sample of 1,031 plants. A comparison of the initial list
and the final sample found no statistically significant dif-
ference between respondents and nonrespondents in terms
of industry or region.
The sampled units are statistically representative of the
universe of plants with more than 50 employees in the
Spanish manufacturing industry.1 According to EUROSTAT
classification (European-Commission, 2008), these are
medium-sized and large plants. Other studies on manufactur-
ing contractors also select for analysis plants that employ
more than 50 people (Bengtsson, 2008; Gilley & Rasheed,
2000). The sampling process was made by quotas resulting
from the intersection of plant size (50-99 employees, 100-
499, and more than 500) and regions, and by plant size and
industries. For a confidence level of 95.5%, the sampling
error is ±2.8%. The survey does not suffer from significant
item nonresponse.
59% of the sample plants belong to a stand-alone firm that
owns no other plant and 41% to a firm that owns at least
another plant (though not necessarily located in Spain). We
were unable to determine the name of the parent company in
7% of the cases. Therefore, in a small number of cases we
might have collected data from different plants of the same
parent. This may be a problem only if plants within a com-
pany have adopted a similar strategy. However, studies that
involved multiple plants within a company have shown that
manufacturing flexibility is not uniform across plants (Upton,
1995). Moreover, in our sample, the share of incompletely
identified plants is small and given that the total sample size
is very large, even in the unlikely worst case scenario of all
nonfully identified cases pertaining to the same parent com-
pany and, at the same time, all of them adopting a unique
strategy, the general results would be quite robust. Therefore,
we believe this circumstance does not pose a serious
difficulty.
Most outsourcers subcontract parts and components or
phases of production (vertical subcontracting). Only 17.5%
of outsourcers declared, on a 1 to 5 Likert-type scale, that
they always subcontract the manufacturing of final products,
which may involve horizontal and vertical subcontracting.
57.7% of the outsourcers declared they never subcontracted
finished products and the rest used this arrangement only
sporadically. The evidence also suggests that networks of
subcontracting are complex as plants may combine several
types of arrangements. For instance, 83.4% of the outsourc-
ers combined subcontracting of parts and components (verti-
cal subcontracting) with some subcontracting of final
products that, as stated, may involve vertical and horizontal
subcontracting.
A pretest of the questionnaire was conducted and all the
principal problems encountered (mainly, ambiguities and
poor understanding of some questions) were fixed before
launching the general fieldwork. At the plant level, in the
large majority of cases we interviewed Directors of
Production and personal interviews lasted on average
approximately 1 hr. In a minority of cases, the interviewee
was somebody designated by the Director of Production. In
a few cases, after the interview was conducted, the more
senior official was subsequently contacted to complete
missing responses on some of the questions. Though the
informant's position in the plant may generate informant
bias, this risk is reduced when researchers use a structured
interview (Vokurka & O'Leary-Kelly, 2000), as was the
case here.
Patterns of technology adoption, the propensity to out-
source production, and the need for flexibility appear to vary
from one sector to another (Acemoglu et al., 2007; Díaz-
Mora, 2008; Morroni, 1991; von Tunzelmann, 1995).
Therefore, in our statistical analyses, we control for sector's
differences. We classified the 26 manufacturing industries in
which the plants operate into three groups according to the
R&D intensity (average R&D/turnover) of the industry. In
doing so, we used the Organization for Economic
Co-Operation and Development (OECD) classification,
which establishes the following cutoff points for average
R&D/turnover: 0.9%, 3%, and 5%. For instance, in indus-
tries classified as having low R&D intensity, their average
R&D/turnover is below 0.9%. We consequently divided the
sample into three subsets, namely plants operating in (a) low
R&D intensity industries2; (b) medium-low R&D intensity
industries3; and (c) medium-high4 and high5 R&D intensity
industries. We took into account the sector of the plant, which
is not necessarily the main sector of the parent company. Our
6 SAGE Open
hypotheses are explored using data for the full sample of
plants and for each of the three subsets.
The variables (Appendix A) were selected on the basis of
the previous discussion. The ORGANIZATION variable has
two categories, outsourcers (i.e., firms that outsourced some
production in the last 3 years) and nonoutsourcers.
The Sample
Of the firms sampled, 41.8% operate in low R&D inten-
sity industries, 31.0% in medium-low intensity indus-
tries, and 27.2% in medium-high and high intensity
industries. Outsourcers account for 64.6% of the sampled
firms and nonoutsourcers for 34.9%. The percentage of
outsourcers rises from 58% of the total number of firms
that operate in low R&D intensity industries, to 67% in
medium-low R&D intensity industries, and to 74% in
medium-high and high R&D intensity industries (Table
1A). Companies that outsource some production to sub-
contracting suppliers are an important feature of Spain's
manufacturing industry.
We use four variables to analyze outsourcing practices:
ORGANIZATION, INTENSITY, BREADTH, and
LOCATION (for definitions of the variables, see Appendix A).
As in other studies on production subcontracting (for reviews
of the literature, see Klein, 2005; Rama & Holl, 2013), we ana-
lyze the organization of plants by using a binary variable
obtained through an explicit question about the use of outsourc-
ing. ORGANIZATION has, then, two categories: outsourcers
and nonoutsourcers. In some of the tests, this binary variable is
complemented by two ordinal variables that measure, respec-
tively, the depth (intensity) and breath (scope) of subcontract-
ing. As in other studies (see, for instance, Bala Subrahmanyan,
2008; Giunta & Trivieri, 2007; Mol, 2005), the intensity of sub-
contracting (INTENSITY) is measured by the share of out-
sourced components and parts in total production. The variable
reflects the extent to which the company relied on external sub-
contractors for the creation of production (Table 1B). 81.8% of
the sampled outsourcers report that outsourced components
and parts amount to less than 25% of production value and
18.2%, which we call heavy outsourcers, report that they
account for 25% or more. The selection of the cutpoint (25% of
total production) was made in accordance with the few pub-
lished statistics and estimations on subcontracting in the
Spanish manufacturing industry (Cámaras de Comercio, 2008;
Cambra de Comerç de Barcelona, 2008). When outsourced
items amount to a larger part of total production, the firm relies
more heavily on subcontracting. By the same token, when sub-
contractors are fully responsible for the manufacturing of com-
ponents and parts, from design to production, we consider that
the breadth of subcontracting is broader and the client relies to
a greater extent on subcontractors for production (BREATH;
Table 1C). In all, 67% of outsourcers indicated that their sub-
contractors were fully responsible for manufacturing of com-
ponents and parts. We expect that relationships predicted in H1
and H2a will be stronger in plants that depend more on subcon-
tracting to generate production.
Finally, 92% of the sampled outsourcers had subcon-
tracted production mainly in Spain and 8% mainly elsewhere
(LOCATION; Table 1D).
Research Method
We start by analyzing certain factors, which, according to
economic theory, may influence company decisions con-
cerning technology adoption (Hall, 2005; Karshenas &
Stoneman, 1995). A large plant or a plant that controls a large
share of the market may have more financial resources to
invest in new manufacturing technology (as opposed to a
small plant or a plant that controls a small share of its princi-
pal market). In countries that are not at the forefront of tech-
nological development, a foreign affiliate or a joint venture
may be better informed about new manufacturing technol-
ogy than domestic firms. Therefore, we study the association
between our variable of interest, ORGANIZATION, and
SIZE, OWNWERSHIP, and MARKET (definitions in
Appendix A) to test for differences between outsourcers and
nonoutsourcers. We also analyze the age of their respective
equipment (AGE) to understand better the possible differ-
ences between outsourcers and nonoutsourcers concerning
their use of manufacturing technology.
Second, we test for differences between outsourcers and
nonoutsourcers (ORGANIZATION) through the use of non-
parametric tests, t-tests and chi-square tests. Our first step
consists of studying their differences with regard to small
batch production (PRODUCTION). In doing so, we put to
test H1. Then, we analyze their differences concerning the
use of AMT by analyzing pairwise complementarities (see
definitions of AMT variables in Appendix A). In doing so,
we put to test H2a and H2b. We also test whether the rela-
tionships predicted in H1 and H2a are stronger in outsourc-
ers that depend more on outsourcing of production than in
the full sample of outsourcers. As stated, we control for the
industry context in which individual factors interact.
Finally, we examine the interaction between a strategy
focused on small batch production and the utilization of
AMT separately in outsourcers and nonoutsourcers. In doing
so, we put to test H3.
Our analysis is of an exploratory nature as we do not
explicitly model firms' decisions. As noted by Ring (1999),
firms have actually engaged in collaboration "in ways that
confound theoretical predictions", hence the need for bot-
tom-up empirical analysis (p. 237).
Results
Factors Influencing Technology Adoption
We start by studying certain aspects that may influence the
plant decision to adopt new technology (see SIZE,
Pardo and Rama 7
OWNERSHIP, and MARKET in Appendix A). Differences
between outsourcers and nonoutsourcers concerning size,
ownership, and market characteristics are not statistically
significant (Table 2A and Table 2B). These key variables are
not likely to account for differences between outsourcers and
nonoutsourcers concerning technology adoption.
We also analyze their possible differences concerning the
age of the manufacturing equipment (Table 2C). A multivari-
ate test (Pillai's trace test) also demonstrates that the average
age (AGE) of the respective equipment used by outsourcers
and nonoutsourcers is similar (F = .084; p = .969). When we
take into account the type of industry in which companies

ers in this respect is confirmed (F = .573; p = .752).
Comparing Types of Production
The PRODUCTION variable (Appendix A) proxies the pro-
duction strategies used by the plants. The plants surveyed
were asked to indicate which of the following statements
best described their activities: the manufacture of (a) small
batches of a great variety of products and custom-made prod-
ucts; (b) large batches of technically homogeneous products
and products in a continuous flow system. The first statement
approximates small batch and customized production and the
second, mass production.
We present now the results of the statistical analyses per-
formed to test H1. Outsourcers tend to manufacture custom-
made products or in small batches (Table 3). Nonoutsourcers,
conversely, are more likely to produce large batches. H1 is
supported. We inquire now whether plants intensively
engaged in outsourcing tend, with more reason, to produce
principally small batch and customized items (column 2,
Table 3). We find that 37% of nonoutsourcers mainly produce
small batches and customized items, versus 53% of outsourc-
ers and, more specifically, 66% of heavy outsourcers, that is,
plants in which outsourced parts and components account for
25% of total production. Results are robust to changes in the
three sets of industries, classified by R&D intensity.
Calculating the odds ratio, we find that the probability of
companies engaging principally in small batch and custom-
ized production is twice as high for outsourcers and 3.4 times
higher for heavy outsourcers (compared with nonoutsourc-
ers). The more heavily the plant relies on subcontracting, the
more it tends to mainly produce small batch and customized
items. This finding is confirmed for each of the three subsets
of firms, and results are statistically significant. H1 is
confirmed.
We test now whether the physical location of subcontrac-
tors affect such findings (see LOCATION in Appendix A).
Differences between companies that mainly subcontract
abroad (international outsourcing) and companies that
mainly subcontract within Spain are not statistically signifi-
cant (Fisher's Exact test =.706; N = 649; df = 1; exact p =
.244). We conclude that outsourcers are more likely than
nonoutsourcers to engage in small batch and customized pro-
duction, and that all types of production networks tend to be
engaged in such a strategy, whatever the partner location.
Table 3 also shows that nonoutsourcers manufacturing stan-
dardized goods and outsourcers providing customized items
still coexist in every sector of Spain's manufacturing industry.
The empirical evidence certainly suggests that production
networks are substantially associated with strategies related
to the customization of production and fragmented markets.
However, coincidence between the organization model (out-
sourcers vs. nonoutsourcers) and type of production (cus-
tomized production vs. mass production) is not complete. In
our sample, 47.3% of outsourcers (and 33.3% of heavy out-
sourcers) are principally committed to mass production and,
conversely, 36.8% of nonoutsourcers customize their output
or provide small batches of products.
Comparing Patterns of AMT Adoption
To test H2a and H2b, we compare the number of categories
of technologies used by outsourcers and nonoutsourcers.
Previous research suggests that firms tend to combine the
usage of various types of AMT (Colombo & Mosconi, 1995;
Milgrom & Roberts, 1990). Moreover, Kotha and Swamidass
(2000) advise researchers to consider AMT as a multidimen-
sional construct. Therefore, we investigate how many such
categories of technologies are utilized by the average out-
sourcer and the average nonoutsourcer. Definitions of the
variables used in the analysis are to be found under the head-
ing "Advanced manufacturing technology," which includes

three subgroups (Appendix A). The surveyed plants were
asked eight questions regarding the usage of different types
of AMT. We defined such multiple response variables as a
multiple response set, which we treated in exactly the same
fashion as a normal continuous variable ($ATM). We then
studiedtheassociationbetween$ATMandORGANIZATION.
Outsourcers, compared with nonoutsourcers, use a greater
variety of AMT, a result confirmed for each of the three sub-
sets of companies (Table 4). This finding is confirmed, "a
fortiori," when we examine heavy outsourcers (INTENSITY
in Appendix A). On average, they use four different catego-
ries of technologies, while nonoutsourcers use only 2.8
(Table 4). This result is confirmed for plants in every group
of Spain's manufacturing industries. Furthermore, outsourc-
ers who were likely to devolve full responsibility to suppliers
(BREATH in Appendix A) used a greater variety of AMT
(four, on average) than outsourcers who just subcontracted
some isolated phase (3.6); according to a t-test, this differ-
ence was statistically significant (t = 2.772, df = 645; p =
.06). The outsourcers that, in principle, relied most on sub-
contracting tended to use the broadest range of AMT.
We also tested for differences between outsourcers and
nonoutsourcers concerning the plant-level utilization of each
individual category of technology. Outsourcers were more
likely to utilize design and engineering technology, manufac-
turing technology, and communication and control technol-
ogy (definitions in Appendix A); in most cases, chi-square
tests indicated positive associations for each of the three sub-
sets of companies (Appendix B). To summarize, outsourcers
are significantly more likely to use AMT. Therefore, H2a is
supported and H2b is rejected.
Output Flexibility and AMT Adoption
We turn our attention now to the interaction between
PRODUCTION and $AMT, but we perform the test sepa-
rately for outsourcers and nonoutsourcers to understand the
possible role of organization. As stated, certain proportion of
nonoutsourcers also tends to produce small batch and custom-
ized items (Table 3); the test allows us to learn whether they
are likely to use AMT. A chi-square test and a Bonferroni test
show that $AMT (the multiresponse set described previously)

and PRODUCTION are associated in the case of outsourcers,
2(3) = 18.093; p < .05, but not for nonoutsourcers, 2(3) =
3.621; p = .891. The results are similar when we confine the
analysis to manufacturing technology, that is, NC/CNC,
FMC/FMS, and lasers, 2(3) = 10.216, p = .01, and 2(3) =
3.410, p = .333, for outsourcers and nonoutsourcers, respec-
tively. Therefore, H3 is supported.
To summarize, the implementation of a strategy based in
production of small batch and customized items is signifi-
cantly associated with the use of AMT in outsourcers (not in
nonoutsourcers). This finding is a contribution of our
article.
Discussion
Production networks are an important feature of Spain's
manufacturing industry. The percentage of outsourcers
(nearly 65% of sampled plants) is high but in accordance
with previous data on subcontracting in Spain (Díaz-Mora,
2008; EIM & IKEI, 2009). However, a comparison of our
data with those of a previous study suggests an increase of
subcontracting practices in the Spanish manufacturing indus-
try (Holl, 2008). Perspective for the figure is provided by
studies on other countries. Around 50% of French manufac-
turing companies with more than 50 employees outsource
some production (Greenan & Mairesse, 2001); a similar per-
centage of outsourcers is reported among Swedish engineer-
ing firms (Bengtsson, 2008). Reasons for differences in the
extent of subcontracting in different countries are still an
open question in the literature, though some authors point to
the possible influence of cultural and institutional factors
(Lazonick & West, 1998; Love & Roper, 2004).
Production networks are substantially associated with
production of small batches and customized items as pre-
dicted by previous studies mainly based on regional evidence
(Becattini, 2002; De Propris, 2001; Paniccia, 1998). Our
results suggest that outsourcers, whatever the location of
their subcontracting partners, are better prepared to produce
small batch and customized items than nonoutsourcers.
Therefore, a contribution of our analysis is a geographic
extension of previous results concerning the association
between subcontracting relationships, and small batch and
customized item production in local settings.
We also found that the expected relationship between the
type of organization and the type of production was stronger
for outsourcers that depended more on outsourcing than for
the full sample of outsourcers.
Subcontracting is associated with the adoption of each of
the three kinds of AMT studied here: design and engineering
technology, manufacturing technology, and communications
and control technology.Acontribution of our study is the anal-
ysis of such associations for different types of AMT (not only
ICT). The number of AMT adopted by a firm may also reveal
its ability to meet customers' requirements (Petroni, 2000).
Our results disprove the argument that firms necessarily
reduce their investment requirements by outsourcing produc-
tion (see, for instance, Berggren & Bengtsson, 2004; Ghisi &
Martinelli, 2006; Gilley & Rasheed, 2000; Havnes &
Senneseth, 2001; Hertz, 1992). In our sample, outsourcers'
investments tend to be similar to those of nonoutsourcers
with regard to the age of equipment while their need to invest
in-house in varied technology seems to be higher, as they
tend to use more categories of AMT. Moreover, the outsourc-
ers that were more reliant on subcontracting relationships
were likely to use a broader range of AMT equipment.
Production networks are forms of organization in which
important resources specific to the relationship among busi-
ness partners are shared (Ménard, 2009). We propose that the
nature of linkages and national context may play a role in the
distribution of such resources between outsourcing partners.
This may explain the divergence of our results with some
studies on high-tech industries in France and the United
States (Lorenz, 2000; Sturgeon, 2002). Popular in automo-
bile, defense, and telecommunication equipment industries,
subcontracting of modules is implemented through systems
integration implying relationships quite similar to arm's
length linkages. By contrast, analyses of outsourcers based
in the manufacturing industries of France, Germany, and
Italy, where subcontracting mainly involves subcontracting
of parts and components (rather than modules), suggest that
these firms keep a range of manufacturing assets "in house,"
to collaborate with suppliers (Brusco, 1999; Herrigel, 2004;
Innocenti & Labory, 2004). Similar to those of the European
studies previously discussed, our results also support
Bengtsson's (2008), who concludes that subcontracting
should not be regarded as an alternative to development of
internal manufacturing capability.
In our sample, the implementation of small batch and cus-
tomized item production tends to be significantly associated
with the adoption of AMT only in outsourcers (not in non-
outsourcers). Though some nonoutsourcers produced mainly
small batch and customized items, they were unlikely to uti-
lize the specific equipment that might facilitate such a pro-
duction. Therefore, organization seems to play a crucial role
in AMT adoption. The empirical evidence suggests that the
implementation of small batch and customized item produc-
tion does not per se lead to the adoption of AMT; outsourcers
may acquire, through their relationship with suppliers, some
networking and technical capabilities that facilitate AMT
adoption.
Conclusion
We analyzed data taken from a plant-level survey of 1,031
Spanish manufacturing industrial plants to understand better
whether a "pro-network bias" might be justified. In doing so,
we compared outsourcers and nonoutsourcers concerning
output flexibility and technology adoption.
Pardo and Rama 11
Outsourcers seem better prepared than nonoutsourcers to
produce small batches and customized items, an important
consideration when the plant competes in volatile or unpre-
dictable markets, the plant needs to produce frequent small
deliveries, or the product variety demanded by the customer
is high. However, subcontracting of production do not lower
necessarily their technology needs--a widespread "pro-
network" argument. Policies implying that the use of net-
working may always allow outsourcers to obtain resources
such as equipment are likely to fail as this is not a reality in
all countries. Our result is also important for prospective
entrepreneurs: networking, "per se," is not likely to allow
access to new technology.
In every type of industry, subcontracting is a form of gov-
ernance especially efficient for the diffusion of new technol-
ogy. This finding supports the idea that outsourcers are likely
to display a technology-driven strategy (Madhok, 2002;
Teece & Pisano, 1994) and seems to confirm the interest of
"pro-network" industrial policies.
The adoption of new manufacturing technology in con-
tractors very often triggers changes in suppliers' assets and
capabilities (Afuah, 2001). A contractor that uses ICT may
put pressure on its subcontractors to also adopt this technol-
ogy to facilitate coordination, thus promoting the spread of
ICT in the industry (Giunta & Trivieri, 2007). If this is true,
our results may imply that outsourcing practices could dis-
play a potential for the modernization of the industry.
Our results suggest that outsourcers may acquire, through
their relationship with suppliers, some networking and tech-
nical capabilities that facilitate AMT adoption. This is an
important consideration in some markets as, according to the
operations management literature, fit between a strategy
based on product variety and use of AMT leads to superior
performance (Kotha & Swamidass, 2000).
Our results are also relevant for academic researchers. In
contrast to earlier studies that studied only some aspects of
AMT, we were able to cover a substantial range of technolo-
gies. Moreover, the adoption of a multidimensional approach
has enabled us to study the relationship with organization in
greater detail. The implication for future studies is that AMT
needs to be studied in its varied forms. Second, our results
suggest that theoretical models (see, for instance, Atamtürk
& Hochbaum, 2001; Kranton & Minehart, 2000) that bal-
ance the trade-offs between acquiring capacity and subcon-
tracting are not necessarily applicable to all national
industries.
In spite of the possible advantages of outsourcers, the
generalized shift toward new forms of production organiza-
tion predicted by some authors (Acemoglu et al., 2007;
Lamoreaux, Raff, & Temin, 2003; Sturgeon, 2002) has not
occurred in Spain's manufacturing industry at the beginning
of the 21st century, although the networked firm certainly
seems to be an emerging governance formula there, espe-
cially in R&D-intensive industries. Our data support the the-
sis (Gilley & Rasheed, 2000; Morroni, 2009) that
organizational forms may be heterogeneous within national
industries. The persistence of "old" forms of governance
suggests that other aspects than those studied here also need
to be compared. This will be the object of future research. A
methodological limitation of our study is the cross-sectional
nature of the data. As noted by Afuah (2001), in an age of
rapid technological change, firm boundaries evolve.
Longitudinal studies of subcontracting are an important ave-
nue for future research.

Notes
1. In Spain, smaller companies are unlikely to engage in produc-
tion outsourcing as outsourcers (Díaz-Mora, 2008)
2. Includes wood, pulp, paper, and printing; food, beverages, and
tobacco; and textiles, leather, and footwear.
3. Includes building and repairing of ships, rubber and plastics,
coke and refined petroleum, other nonmetallic mineral prod-
ucts, and basic metals and manufactured metal products.
4. Includes electrical machinery, motor vehicles, chemicals
(excluding pharmaceuticals), railroad equipment, and machin-
ery and equipment.
5. Includes aircraft and spacecraft; pharmaceuticals; office and
computing machines; radio, TV, and communications equip-
ment; medical, precision, and optical instruments. While the
Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development
(OECD) classification has four categories, here the Medium-
High and High R&D intensity classes were collapsed to avoid
thin cells in cross-tabulations.
