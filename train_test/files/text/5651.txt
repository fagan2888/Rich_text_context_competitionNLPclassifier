Article
The hidden curriculum is a global phenomenon of signifi-
cance to educators around the world because school text-
books play a crucial role in shaping students' worldviews of
female and male roles in their respective societies. The
author of this article applied a qualitative case study research
method (Yin, 2009) to the first book of the New Crown series,
which was examined for gender bias--the depiction of
women in subordinate roles or engaged in stereotypical
activities. A previous study on Japanese English language
textbooks (ELTs) conducted by Otlowski (2003) emphasized
that "a number of textbooks, and especially textbooks pub-
lished in Japan fail to represent accurately the substantial
role women . . . play in the make up and workforce of mod-
ern societies" (p. 7). The task of reform is very challenging,
and differs according to national and cultural circumstances.
The overarching task is one that entails changing the cultural
definition of masculinity to include equality with and respect
for females. The explicit purpose of this article is therefore to
explore the following question: Has subliminal gender bias
been eliminated from Japanese ELTs? This case study finds
for a negative response to this question, and verifies earlier
research on this issue in the Japanese context.
New Crown, first published in 2002, is currently on its
fourth edition (2014). The focus of this article is placed upon
the first book (in a series of three) which provides extensive
examples of gender bias, and concurs with prior research on
this issue in the Japanese context. The New Crown series is
designed for junior high school students (seventh-ninth
grades) who typically utilize one book for each academic
year. An extensive team of writers contributed to the series
published by the Sanseido Company Ltd. As one would
expect, the language level is basic. The conversations are
short (typically four lines), and the grammar is highly struc-
tured for repetition. The most recent statistics made available
by the Collaborative Reference Database of the National
Diet Library (2008) show New Crown to comprise nearly a
quarter of ELTs being used in Japanese public schools at that
time (21.6%).
United Nations Criteria
Based on the United Nation's Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (adopted
1979), and the Beijing Platform for Action (adopted 1995),
textbooks promote gender equality if they meet the follow-
ing criteria: (a) females are protagonists, (b) females and
males are not described according to a stereotypical sexual

A Qualitative Analytic Case Study of
Subliminal Gender Bias in Japanese ELTs
Ian Clark1
Abstract
Bias is communicated via the "hidden curriculum"--the vehicle for the unspoken academic, social, and cultural messages
that are communicated to students while they are in school. Revealing the hidden curriculum in English language textbooks
(ELTs) entails an analytical and holistic approach to the content of the text and images appearing in school textbooks by
connecting corresponding examples of subliminal bias which may be many pages apart. This article reviews existing Japanese
and international literature on the gender bias created by the hidden curriculum before going on to present a Japanese
case study of an ELT in widespread use in Japanese public junior high schools. It was found that while males and females
are represented equally in terms of quantity, there exists a remarkable subliminal gender bias that affects young learners'
worldviews of female and male roles in society.

division of labor, (c) ways of living free of conventional
ideas of femininity and masculinity are described positively,
(d) topics encourage students to think about sexual discrimi-
nation and gender equality, (e) topics encourage students to
reconsider various issues close to them from a gender per-
spective, and (f) topics encourage students to think about
female's human rights as a global issue. In the case study of
New Crown, it will be seen that the textbook fails to deliver
on any of the above criteria. A system of education is a prod-
uct of collective thought, reinforcing and reflecting the social
and cultural context of specific nations.
Politics and History: The Japanese
Context
It is in this context of stereotyping at Japanese schools that
Skelton (1997) asked the question "do current conceptions of
curricula reflect and anticipate the challenge of living in a
world which is rapidly changing and becoming ever more
complex?" (p. 177). This is a question of some extreme rel-
evance to Japan facing a very uncertain future, both socially
and therefore economically, due to its aging population and
difficulty in recruiting and retaining women into a declining
labor pool. In response to these issues in 2013, Prime Minister
Abe announced a surprising move away from earlier conser-
vative policies (i.e., females should remain at home and raise
children) toward a policy called "womenomics." This policy
aims not only at increasing the number of women in employ-
ment but also, and more radically, at increasing the number
of women in management roles--currently only 6.6% in
3,873 companies (Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare
Pamphlet, 2014). In all, 42.5% of Japanese women have
some post-secondary education--among the most educated
in the world--yet only 67.5% are gainfully employed, part-
time work included (Auslin, 2015). Even then, many are in
temporary employment until marriage and leave work to
have children as indicated by a sharp drop in the employment
rate among women aged between 35 and 39 (Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD],
2012). The Meiji Yasuda Institute for Life and Wellness
(2014) conducted a survey (n = 3,616) finding that 73% of
female respondents left work after marriage or childbirth,
only 14.7% continued to work after marriage, and only
13.6% returned to work when their child reached middle-
school age (an age deemed fit by many Japanese mothers).
This may be traced back through Japan's complex history
to the notion of "Good Wife, Wise Mother" (Fukaya, 1988).
This social policy originated during the Meiji period (1868-
1912) and became increasingly institutionalized in the early
1920s. The emergence of the nuclear family in Japan meant
that by the 1920s, the modern gender division of labor that
assigned work to men and domestic duties to women began to
be reflected and driven by a rapid growth in the number
of "practical" middle schools for girls. The term practical
referred to home economics (e.g., housekeeping and sewing),
and by 1925, the number of students enrolled in girls' middle
schools had exceeded the number in co-educational middle
schools, and continued to rise (National Institute of
Educational Policy Research [NIER], 2014).
Rigid family roles and relationships have therefore been
the "backbone" of Japanese society. However, this perspec-
tive began to change due to Japan's aging population, delayed
marriages, and a fallen birthrate, which has fallen below the
level needed for replacement (Rebick & Takenaka, 2009). In
response, provision should be made in public school ELTs
(and more generally) for young learners to understand the
economic impact that female participation may have. In
2010, a Goldman Sachs report estimated that if women in
Japan were employed at the same rate as men (about 80%),
economic output would grow by up to 15%. This was cor-
roborated by a 2014 article in The Economist that stated rais-
ing female labor participation to the level of males could add
eight million people to Japan's shrinking workforce (pre-
dicted to decline by 40% by 2050), and again predicted a
potential increase in GDP by as much as 15%. It seems
unlikely that these targets will be met unless Japan's Ministry
of Education (MEXT) addresses Skelton's question to be
found at the beginning of this section.
Theoretical Perspectives on the Hidden
Curriculum
The hidden curriculum is that set of implicit messages relating to
knowledge, values, norms of behaviour and attitudes that
learners experience in and through educational processes . . . and
each learner mediates the message in her/his own way. (Skelton,
1997, p. 188)
There are various perspectives on the hidden curriculum.
First, the functionalist perspective, as seen in the founda-
tional work of Parsons (1959), focuses on schools as vehicles
through which students learn the social norms, values, and
skills they require to function and contribute to the existing
society (Giroux, 1983). This is a positive account which pos-
tulates the need for social control to ensure social success. It
is this macroscopic perspective that Japanese policy adheres
to most closely, hence the reproduction of stereotypical gen-
der roles in New Crown Book 1. Second is the liberal per-
spective. Liberalists take a microscopic view by examining
the internal structures and processes of schooling as opposed
to how schools exercise control to create and maintain the
social and cultural status quo. It considers the hidden curric-
ulum to be those practices of school life that take on an
appearance of accepted normality through their daily pro-
duction and reproduction. Many liberal critiques of school-
ing set out to expose those unquestioned and therefore
"hidden" aspects of school life such as school rules and
codes of discipline, learning organization (e.g., streaming
and mixed ability), and teacher­student relationships/inter-
actions. They seek to make explicit the assumptions on
Clark 3
which everyday practices come to light and describe the pro-
cess of how these practices are created and maintained in
classrooms. For example, Hargreaves (1967) found that once
streamed into their respective ability levels, students allo-
cated to lower streams assumed the learning identities of stu-
dents of lower ability.
A third perspective is the critical perspective. The key
problem for critical research is a critical-Marxist analysis of
the hidden curriculum to address how schooling functions to
reproduce various inequalities in society (Bowles & Gintis,
1976). It "recognises that `official' or formal curriculum
statements of schools support notions to those hidden or
unintended consequences of schooling which lead to social
injustice" (Skelton, 1997, p. 181). There is a body of founda-
tional work from the critical perspective by feminist research-
ers that demonstrates that schools, despite assumptions to the
contrary, do not support outcome equity and therefore create
social asymmetry. In a feminist critique of reality, the norms,
values, expectations, and practices of schools reproduce
patriarchal relations in society (McDonald, 1980; Spender &
Spender, 1980). Furthermore, contributions by researchers
such as Apple (1986) reveal the "hidden curriculum" of
schooling as a middle-class, male-dominated phenomenon,
which consequently leads to inequality and injustice in
society.
The final, and most abstract perspective, is that of the
post-structuralists. Although post-structuralism (as seen in
the work of Foucault) grew from structuralist perspectives,
it rejects the use of sweeping totalizing theories--those
ideas which set-up monolithic opposing forces, for exam-
ple, Marxism versus capitalism. For post-structural philos-
ophers, social power is multifarious and multi-located.
Thus, the power behind social reproduction through the
hidden curriculum cannot be reduced to a conspiratorial
group or entity such as "class interests," "the state," or a
"patriarchy." Naturally then, critical theorists, of the third
perspective stated earlier, would critique post-structuralists
for under-emphasizing the role of asymmetrical power rela-
tions. Foucault (1981), however, does acknowledge the
overt and covert influence of power and knowledge over
individuals. Institutions, such as schools, direct power and
knowledge to facilitate the imposition of disciplinary prac-
tices that reduce individuals to passive recipients. Post-
structuralists see power as being circulated through
discourse. In recent years, it has been recognized and
emphasized that mutual and equal classroom interactions
are at the core of learning and, depending on the learning
environment (Clark, 2014), can either facilitate or frustrate
"good learning" (Clark, 2011; Toussaint-Clark & Clark,
2008). The post-structuralist view is therefore the most
removed from the functionalist perspective paralleled by
Japanese policy on education because it emphasizes the
examination of the democratic values of equality and repre-
sentation, and advocates for viewpoints that challenge the
status quo (Clark, 2011). The unfortunate consequence is
that there are very few active researchers who take a post-
structuralist approach to curricula at Japan universities or
policy bureaus. A rare exception is Professor Masahiro
Arimoto of the Graduate School of Education at Tohoku
University (see Arimoto, Clark, Yamamoto, & Shinkawa,
2015). It is worth noting that a perspective inherently con-
tains internal differences (sub-perspectives) that overlap or
complement each other to some degree. To conclude, while
delineating perspectives conveys central ideas, it remains
an exercise in reductionism which oversimplifies social
reality. The key point therefore is to not become a "slave"
to any particular perspective on the hidden curriculum.
Comparative Studies
Inequity in International Contexts
A significant body of research which focuses on ELTs has
been produced by various nations around the world. For
example, a recent Iranian analysis found that only 18% of
females were portrayed in occupational roles, whereas for
males, this was 82% (Gharhavi & Mousavi, 2012). In a
Greek ELT, only 13.6% of women were portrayed as paid
workers compared with 53% of men (Deiyanni-Kouimtzi,
1992). A Jordanian study (Hamdan, 2010) found that males
were shown to be the major element in the labor force in
society, filling 79% of the occupational roles. This finding is
paralleled by a Malaysian study (Kumarid, 2002), which
found males were engaged in a greater variety of occupations
and the active participants in many outdoor activities. In con-
trast, females were limited to a small range of occupations
and engaged in passive indoor activities. Similarly, in
Pakistan, a study (Mattu & Hussain, 2003) emphasized that
textbook publishers are "resistant to women's rights and
believe in the status quo" (p. 91). The study noted that girls
are portrayed as unobtrusive, while boys are curious, active,
and ready to take the initiative.
Even in nations with a national commitment to gender
equity, there are no guarantees. For example, in Sweden,
Holmqvist and Gjörup (2006) found that most occupations
that were held by men and women were described without
an occupation or with a stereotypical one. Such problems
do not necessarily recede with the passage of time. For
example, Lee (2006) analyzed ELTs in Hong Kong across a
period of some 30 years, and reported that there had been
no discernible improvement across this time. This finding
is well supported by the bias and inequality found in the
Japanese context.
Inequity in Japanese Contexts
There is a long historical background for gender inequity
in Japanese ELTs that foregrounds the existence of a "hid-
den curriculum" in the textbooks of today (Kato, 2002;
Lee, 2014; Otlowski, 2003; Sano, Iida, & Hardy, 2001;
4 SAGE Open
Sakita, 1995). Some 15 years ago, Sano et al. (2001) gave
a presentation on a range of Japanese junior high school
ELTs (including New Crown) at which they presented vari-
ous characteristics of bias. These characteristics included
the empowerment of males as deciders and choosers, that
remarks made by males had more substance, and chapter
themes focused on male characters. Similarly, Otlowski
(2003) found that women were portrayed as homemakers
and mothers, a bias reinforced by a general lack of women
in the workplace. Women were seen to participate in and
oversee domestic duties such as laundry, shopping, and
food preparation. In contrast, situations outside the home
were the domain of male characters. Otlowski's study par-
allels an earlier Japanese study by Sakita (1995) which
found that males were depicted as mountaineer, sailor,
colonel, priest, and carpenter. Females filled occupations
such as student, maid, actress, ballet dancer, and mother.
Topics on gender (e.g., women's movements and female
protagonists) were (and still are) a rare inclusion in
Japanese textbooks, "and only three women--Marie Curie,
Mother Teresa, and Helen Keller--appeared frequently"
(Kato, 2002). In a recent study of Japanese textbooks con-
ducted by Lee (2014), it was found that "general dispari-
ties in the forms of female invisibility, male firstness and
stereotypical images are still prevalent in the textbooks
examined" (p. 1).
The findings of Sakita (1995), Sano et al. (2001), and
Otlowski (2003) were published many years ago. These
background studies indicate that the Japanese education min-
istry's mission to propagate gender equality through educa-
tion has not been put into practice by textbook writers and
publishers. As Lee (2006) noted, one should not be surprised
that gender inequity exists even when considering that the
fourth edition of the New Crown series was published as
recently as 2014. The textbook under review contains numer-
ous examples of thematic bias, specifically themes of silence,
compliance, subordination and the social status, occupa-
tional roles, and activities in general of women vis-à-vis
those of males.
Qualitative Analysis
The previous section presents a number of international and
Japanese-based studies which found that females are under-
represented in ELTs. However, this was not found to be true
in the case of New Crown Book 1. There are 315 illustrations
of males and 303 of females (3.9% more males). However, it
is worth noting that some pages do feature males only, while
this is never the case for females. For example, there are 11
male images on page 80 and 23 on page 105, yet there are no
females. The closest corresponding page is page 81 where
only two of the 12 images are of males. In general, it is not
the quantity of males and females that creates bias; it is the
qualitative aspects of their lives as they enact their respective
social worlds in words and pictures. They are seen to engage
in differing activities, which present them in ways suggest-
ing biased social categorizations.
The Front Cover
"Male firstness" (Lee, 2014) begins on the front cover. The
cover presents an illustration of a boy and girl in a country-
side setting. The male is the dominant figure, large, and in
the foreground. He is dynamic and active, riding his bicycle
at high speed as indicated by his hair flying behind him. He
is waving his hat in the air. We may also imagine that the boy
is shouting to his female friend who stands in the distance as
a shadowy and silent figure. His female counterpart is stand-
ing still, and there is no suggestion of movement or speech.
She is waiting for him in the shade, a distant, passive,
and obscure figure. The cover may be found at http://www.

rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=4385701881&pf_rd_m=AN1VRQ
ENFRJN5&pf_rd_r=0T95AE9S8BHWWDMMM0SD
While the first book of the series is the focus of this case
study, the front cover of New Crown Book 2 exhibits similar
favoritism toward males. In that case, a boy and girl are in a
hot air balloon soaring over the countryside. The boy is
empowered by the possession of a telescope so that he may
see further and with greater clarity.
Sport and Leisure
Sports can be used to present males and females differently.
For example, an illustration of an aggressive looking male
baseball player with his bat raised is paired with one of a girl
in her school uniform smiling benignly. In basketball, there
is a sense of non-stop action and the potential for bodily con-
tact. Baseball uses a hard bat and requires the players to hit
hard and slide aggressively. Tennis, on the contrary, is per-
ceived as a relatively gentle game more suitable for less
powerful females. Consequently, basketball and baseball are
represented in the textbook as almost exclusively male activ-
ities. There are 12 illustrations of males playing baseball and
12 for basketball, whereas there is only one female baseball
player and two female basketball players. For tennis, there
are 15 female images and only three male tennis players.
There is a chapter themed around wheelchair basketball, a
choice of sport that suggests an overtly male theme. However,
the writers/publishers do appear to have made some effort to
redress the male versus female inequality in terms of relative
quantity. Page 82 features 12 illustrations, of which 10 are of
females. Yet, even in a chapter devoted to basketball, none of
the images on this page portray females as basketball play-
ers. While girls are never illustrated as basketball players,
there is a photograph of four female players on the final page
of the chapter; however, this is counterbalanced by four illus-
trations of males on the same page, one of which is a game
official.
Clark 5
Employment and Social Activities
The social and economic supremacy of males is clearly evi-
dent on pages 14 and 15. Of the 19 illustrations, only 5 are
girls. So, while the overall number of appearances in the text-
book is quite balanced, there is a very clear imbalance on
these pages devoted to occupations and activities. The pages
feature males engaged in adventurous, superior, or "cool"
roles: astronaut, doctor, administrator, vet, father, and pop
singer. Males are also depicted as engaged in various activi-
ties that reinforce positive aspects of maleness: (a) opening a
box in a way that suggests curiosity and risk-taking, (b) play-
ing with a yo-yo skillfully and dynamically, (c) eating lunch
with a large confident grin, (d) a boy with his mouth wide
open in an exaggerated manner suggesting great confidence,
and (e) one of the main male characters writing his name on
the classroom board, a further indication of the academic
hierarchy in schools. In contrast, of the five girls, none are
shown to be economically productive. Instead, they are shown
to be (a) looking pretty while silently drinking juice, (b) hold-
ing up a plate of food that we must assume she has prepared,
and (c) asking a question, which can only suggest a gap in her
knowledge. We know she is asking a question and not answer-
ing one because of the large question mark in the picture. The
corresponding image appears on page 121. Here, a boy has
his hand raised to answer a question. We understand he knows
the answer because the (male) teacher is pointing at him to
elicit it from him; (d) taking direction, albeit from an older
female. The fifth illustration is of a girl, simply standing there
and doing nothing at all; the very example of passivity. There
are two small illustrations of a woman in a laboratory coat
(p. 54), but rather ironically, it serves to remind the reader of
the remarkable paucity of such images. Another female is
shown as working at a museum. She is on reception, her sole
purpose to receive and support others. Predictably, the uni-
formed authority figure of the town (a police officer) is male.
Female Passivity
It has been found that girls are often depicted exhibiting
"healthy" behaviors typical for girls and not boys. They are
"silent, compliant, gentle, helpful, neat and polite" (Irby &
Brown, 2011, p. 22). Irby and Brown (2011) emphasized that
"the lessons of the hidden curriculum teach girls to value
silence and compliance, to view those qualities as a virtue"
(p. 244). This is reflected in the composition of the New
Crown textbook under review here.
Much of what happens in the textbook occurs at an imagi-
nary school. Several pages into the textbook (pp. 6-7), the
reader is presented with a plan view of the town in which the
school is located as a double page feature. The main charac-
ters are depicted, as are other uncredited characters, all of
whom are engaged in various activities around the town.
Boys are more active: running, riding bicycles, and walking
dogs. The theme of female silence and reception is first
encountered in this section of the textbook. A girl sits quietly
at an ice-cream stall whereas her male companion speaks, his
mouth wide. While there is only one instance of female
silence on this page, it indicates why it is necessary to avoid
a reductionist approach. Illustrations that reinforce the theme
of silent girls listening to "chatty" boys recur throughout the
textbook. For example, on page 70, a boy speaks as a girl
listensandtakesnotes.ThisisconsonantwiththeFoucauldian
perspective on "hidden curriculum": Boys are seen to have
ownership (power) over the text (knowledge) rather than
sharing it. They have preferential access, holding the books
and pointing to them while the girls stand passively at their
side. In terms of numbers, there are precisely no instances of
females taking a dominant discursive role unless they are
performing stereotypical domestic duties. When taken col-
lectively (as a whole), the images (illustrations and photo-
graphs) and discourse reveal asymmetrical power relations.
Two of the girls in the town are demonstrating compliance
as they walk across a pedestrian crossings obediently. The
corresponding male image is of a handicapped boy in a
wheelchair. These forms of subliminal bias are difficult to
discern unless one takes a holistic approach, but when taken
together, individual images create a whole image that rein-
forces girls for compliance and suggests that less able boys
behave in the same way as girls.
There are a number of illustrations that depict girls as pas-
sive recipients and boys as the dominant interlocutor during
male­female interactions.
Even though the conversations in the text are very short,
there are clear examples of the female characters taking a sub-
ordinate or caretaker role. On page 21, a girl compliments her
male friend's prowess ("You're good Ken.") at basketball
before going on to ask him "Are you thirsty?" This question is
reinforced through repetition further down the page by a dif-
ferent girl.Another example of a girl in a caretaker role is to be
found on page 62 as she organizes the school bags of her male
friends. A further example of girls supporting boys occurs on
page 102. The girl provides the boy with the information he
requires to make his decision on what they will do ("I see.
Then today let's take a bus"), and the conversation ends.
Aconversation on page 23 opens with the girl apologizing
to the boy without any particular reason or context for doing
so ("Oh, I'm sorry"). She appears to be apologizing for being
there at all. This is an example of those "healthy" behaviors
that "ideal" (female) students should exhibit. That is, she is
submissive and polite. Girls in the textbook are faced with an
unfavorable discourse gradient in other ways:
Boy: I have a cat.
Girl: Really?
Boy: The cat is white.
Girl: Oh. (p. 125)
6 SAGE Open
The girl, while responsive, is monosyllabic and receptive.
This is also one of two examples of male ownership on this
page without corresponding female examples.
There is a subliminal gender bias toward girls for linguis-
tic competence (Emma: "I study Japanese before class." p. 74)
and against girls for the traditional male-dominated subject
area of math. The same character (Emma) asks a male friend
for help with her mathematics homework:
Emma: Can you help me with tomorrow's math homework?
(p. 90)
Both aspects conform to the widely held belief that girls
are expected to be less capable than boys at mathematics,
but more linguistically able than male students. However,
there is no explicit suggestion that Emma is actually good
at Japanese here, only that she gets up early to study it.
However, we know that she cannot do math and that her
male counterpart can.
Females as Domestic Technicians
There is a general expectation that Japanese women will leave
employment to organize and manage the household. In the
case of the textbook, this is reflected in both words and pic-
tures. On page 44, a boy and a girl are at the supermarket:
Emma: I have a shopping bag.
Ken: Good.
Even in this brief exchange, we see the female has orga-
nized for one of her primary functions--shopping--and we
see the male reinforce her positively for that behavior. In the
background of the same picture, two adult females are shop-
ping in their roles as "good wives," one of which is with a
small child performing her role as the "wise mother." As
stated earlier, this is a social role of traditional cultural sig-
nificance in Japan (Fukaya, 1988). The "healthy" female
roles of shopping and food preparation are reinforced in the
textbook. For example,
"How much is the blouse?"
"It's 2000 yen." (p. 141)
"Where is Mom?" (capital M in the original text).
"She's in the kitchen." (p. 142)
There are more vignettes that depict females as domestic
managers who make cookies and go shopping (p. 107).
In this world, the domestic and social roles and behav-
iors are clearly demarked. In a further obvious example, a
picture of a man dressed as a chef is paired with one of a
woman dressed as a housewife. She is portrayed so stereo-
typically that she actually appears to be wearing her apron
as her uniform (p. 124). Such images offer proof that male
cooks are engaged in more important bread-winning roles
outside the home while females are subordinated to the
domestic domain.
Even when males are shown to be actively involved in
domestic work, it is the female who assumes some level of
control:
Wait. Don't wash the dishes.
Please use this paper. (p. 48)
In a different illustration (p. 104), a boy assists his mother
in the kitchen. His mother is in control at the stove, reinforc-
ing the stereotype that she has dominion over the kitchen as
the "good wife" and over her child as the "wise mother."
Conclusion
The findings of this case study confirm those of the earlier
Japanese and international studies introduced in the litera-
ture review of this article. It is of course perfectly acceptable
to depict men as adventurous, confident, knowledgeable,
and dynamic if textbooks then include corresponding images
and conversations that elevate females to an equal status,
and promote their learning identities beyond that of compli-
ant caretaker. Unfortunately, the corresponding female
vignettes are either absent or, where present, operate to
exaggerate bias. There are very few positive accounts of
boys taking some measure of domestic responsibility pre-
sented as singular instances of dishwashing and room clean-
ing. There is also one illustration of a girl taking out the
rubbish. It is a rather ambiguous image as it may be seen as
a foray into those duties typically performed by males, or as
another domestic duty which females should take care to
perform. There are other such examples; however, they are
notably infrequent instances that provide only cosmetic
attention to gender equality.
Despite the important role for working women, this case
study revealed a "hidden curriculum" that communicates
overt and subliminal gender bias, missing the opportunity to
prepare young learners for a more economically viable future
founded on equitable social and economic participation.
When analyzed holistically, bias accumulates to form a per-
vasive counterproductive theme of social and economic
inequality between females and males. In this particular case
study, which concurs with prior research on ELTs and gender
bias, it is apparent that despite MEXT's stated intention of
equality through education, Japanese ELT writers and pub-
lishers have fallen short of the United Nations criteria for
gender equity, and those of the industrialized global commu-
nity. What changes can be made to construct a learning
environment that ensures outcome equity, and employment

opportunity based on ability rather than gender? First, teach-
ers need to be made aware of their tendencies toward gender
bias. Next, they need to be provided with in-service pro-
grams which help them acquire strategies that combat ineq-
uitable teaching styles. Finally, and as this article highlights,
efforts need to be made to remove gender bias from educa-
tional materials. Teachers need to be aware of the gender bias
embedded in educational materials and texts and need to take
steps to combat this bias. An innovative approach is to plan
classes that use biased texts to help students identify the gen-
der bias inside them, and facilitate critical discussions about
why that bias exists. Bailey (1992) identified six attributes
that need to be considered when delivering a gender-equita-
ble curriculum: classroom materials need to be (a) inclusive,
(b) accurate, (c) affirmative, (d) representative, (e) inte-
grated, and (f) weave together the experiences, needs, and
interests of both males and females. McCormick (1995)
echoed the findings of this analytic case study by emphasiz-
ing that
we need to look at the stories we are telling our students and
children. Far too many of our classroom examples, storybooks,
and texts describe a world in which boys and men are bright,
curious, brave, inventive, and powerful, but girls and women are
silent, passive, and invisible.
