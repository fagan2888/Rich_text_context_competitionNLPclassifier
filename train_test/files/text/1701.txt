High-fructose corn syrup: is this what's for dinner?1­3
Kiyah J Duffey and Barry M Popkin
ABSTRACT
Background: Research on trends in consumption of added sugar
and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in the United States has largely
focused on calorically sweetened beverages and ignored other
sources.
Objective: We aimed to examine US consumption of added sugar
and HFCS to determine long-term trends in availability and intake
from beverages and foods.
Design: We used 2 estimation techniques and data from the Nation-
wide Food Consumption Surveys (1965 and 1977), Continuing Sur-
vey of Food Intake by Individuals (1989­1991), and the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1999­2000, 2001­
2002, and 2003­2004) to examine trends in HFCS and added sugar
both overall and within certain food and beverage groups.
Results: Availability and consumption of HFCS and added sugar
increased over time until a slight decline between 2000 and 2004. By
2004, HFCS provided roughly 8% of total energy intake compared
with total added sugar of 377 kcal  person1  d1, accounting for
17% of total energy intake. Although food and beverage trends were
similar, soft drinks and fruit drinks provided the most HFCS (158
and 40 kcal  person1  d1 in 2004, respectively). Moreover,
among the top 20% of individuals, 896 kcal  person1  d1 of
addedsugarwasconsumedcomparedwith505kcal  person1  d1
of HFCS. Among consumers, sweetened tea and desserts also rep-
resented major contributors of calories from added sugar (100
kcal  person1  d1).
Conclusion: Although increased intake of calories from HFCS is
important to examine, the health effect of overall trends in added
caloric sweeteners should not be overlooked. Am J Clin Nutr

INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, extensive research has focused on un-
derstanding both the trends and the consequences of the large
increases in caloric sweeteners consumed in the United States.
Much of the research has focused on the beverage sector, where
several excellent meta-analyses have examined the effects of
calorically sweetened beverage drink intake on energy intake,
weight gain, and diabetes (1­3). Extensive research has docu-
mented both the large amounts of added caloric sweeteners in the
diet and the large increases in the consumption of these sweet-
eners over the past 2 decades (4­9). High-fructose corn syrup
(HFCS) has been used increasingly as a replacement for other
caloric sweeteners, first in beverages, and more recently, as a
replacement for sugar in thousands of other processed and pack-
aged foods (10). A causal link between increased consumption of
HFCS and obesity has been hypothesized (10), and although
animal research (11­14) and a small number of human studies
(15, 16) support this hypothesis, Bray et al note (10) that exten-
sive human research on this topic is limited and deserves further
attention.
HFCS is interesting for many reasons. At equal caloric value,
HFCS is both sweeter and less expensive than other added sweet-
eners. Thus, food and beverage manufacturers were able to in-
crease the sweetness of their products for a fraction of the price.
The overall result has been an increase in the intensity of the
sweetness of soft drinks and other caloric beverages (10, 17).
There is some potential for disagreement on this point, but only
indirect evidence exists (18).
In part, the shift from using sucrose to HFCS was encouraged
by extensive government subsidies of corn farmers, with a ma-
jority of US farm policies focused on promoting increased pro-
duction of inexpensive corn. One study showed that as a result of
such subsidies, the consumer price of corn (and its byproducts)
remained 25­30% below cost (of production) between 1997
and 2005 (19). For beverage manufacturers, in particular, lower
sweetener costs allowed increased serving sizes (which would be
only marginally more expensive for the consumer), thus freeing
money for marketing campaigns (20). Although far less studied,
similar trends have likely occurred in other food sectors. How-
ever, HFCS should not be studied independently of the context of
trends in total caloric sweetener consumption. With rising corn
prices and a farm bill proposing to remove some of the corn
subsidies, it is possible that HFCS prices will begin to rise con-
siderably. Were this to occur, it may result in the substitution of
another caloric sweetener for HFCS, resulting in continued con-
sumption of sweetened, refined carbohydrates in the United
States.
This study focuses on updating our understanding of the con-
sumption of both HFCS and other added caloric sweeteners.
Essentially, these added sugars are found in thousands of food
items consumed in the United States and globally (21, 22). Un-
like prior studies, the present study expands the efforts of previ-
ous researchers to estimate added sugars and HFCS consumption

reflects the contribution of these energy sources to the US diet.
METHODS
Availability of HFCS
Given the absence of direct measures of HFCS consumption,
food disappearance data provide the best indirect estimate of
HFCS availability in the US. We used data from the US Depart-
ment of Agriculture's (USDA's) Economic Research Service
Food Availability Databases (23) to examine the availability of
total sugars and HFCS. Measures of total caloric sweetener and
HFCS availability were taken directly from this data. Using mea-
sures of total HFCS availability in pounds per person per day, we
further calculated the proportion of HFCS that is HFCS-42 ver-
sus HFCS-55. These 2 formulations of HFCS refer to the per-
centage of the sweetener that is fructose, ie, HFCS-42 has 42%
fructose and 58% glucose. HFCS-55 has sweetness equivalent to
sucrose and is used in many carbonated soft drinks, particularly
intheUnitedStates.HFCS-42issomewhatlesssweetandisused
in many fruit-flavored noncarbonated beverages, baked goods,
and other products. All results account for production and import
and are adjusted for loss, waste, and spoilage. Data were avail-
able from 1970 through 2004 (23).
Foods containing HFCS
Comprehensive information on foods and beverages contain-
ing HFCS is not readily available and must be pieced together
fromvarioussources.ItisclearthatHFCSaccountsforalmostall
added caloric sweeteners used by manufacturers of soft drinks
and fruit drinks as well as other specialty calorically sweetened
beverages (24, 25). In addition, HFCS can be found in numerous
processed foods, including canned foods (eg, soups, fruits), ce-
reals and baked goods, desserts, sweetened and flavored dairy
products (eg, yogurt, condiments, and jellies), candies, and many
fast food items. Most of the information on availability comes
from lists compiled by individuals who have examined ingredi-
ents of foods in their homes or from organizations concerned
with HFCS-related food allergies (26­28). Direct measurements
of the HFCS composition of foods are not available from man-
ufacturers or publicly available food-composition tables. For the
purposes of this article, foods that had either added sugar or
fructose were considered to potentially contain HFCS.
Estimating HFCS and added sugar in foods
We obtained direct estimates of added sugar by using the
USDA food-composition table and its recipe and servings files.
The recipe and servings files provide a direct measure of added
sugar in each food. Because direct estimates of HFCS are not
available, and because the existing literature on this topic is
scarce, we elected to estimate the HFCS content in foods and
beverages by using 2 different techniques referred to as the NDS
and Glinsmann methods. These are discussed in detail below.
NDS method
This method uses measured total fructose and added sugar
from the University of Minnesota's Nutrition Coordinating Cen-
ter (NCC) Nutrient Database System (NDS) sugars file and mea-
sures of added sugar from the USDA food-composition table.
The USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory is the primary source of
nutrient values and nutrient composition within the NDS. How-
ever, these values are supplemented by food manufacturers' in-
formation and data that are available in the scientific literature
(29). Using data from NDS was the only way we could obtain
direct measures of fructose for sample foods. For all foods and
beverages, except soda and fruit drinks (for which HFCS was
assumed to be 100% of added sugar), we used a 3-step process to
estimate HFCS. The steps were as follows:
1) Calculation of the proportion of added sugar that is
fructose
Using added sugar and fructose values provided for 988 foods
in the NDS sugars database, we determined the proportion of
added sugar that is fructose (Pf
)[r] by dividing fructose (g/100 g
food) by added sugar (g/100 g food). This calculation was carried
out for each food code individually.
2) Estimation of the amount of added sugar that is HFCS
We found direct matches between NDS and USDA food codes
for roughly 50% of the data. For these foods, the Pf
was multi-
pliedbytheamountofaddedsugarineachfoodasreportedbythe
USDA. This resulted in an estimate of the gram amount of HFCS
per food code. This value was then multiplied by the amount of
added sugar per food reported for a total estimate of HFCS by
food for each respondent. For example, "fruit flavored juice
drinks" had 13.575 g fructose/100 g drink and 37.078 g total
added sugar/100 g drink. The estimated proportion of added
sugar that was fructose [Pf
 (13.575/37.078)  100  36.6%)
was multiplied by the amount of "fruit flavored juice drinks"
reported consumed by each respondent.
For food codes where no direct match between NDS and
USDA was possible, we multiplied the mean proportion of fruc-
tose (Pf
)[r] assigned to each food codes' larger food group (de-
scribed in detail below) by the amount of added sugar in each
food as reported by the USDA.
3) Generation of measure of HFCS by food group
HFCS consumption was calculated for each food and summed
across food groups. Data are presented by food group across
time.
Glinsmann method
In 1986, a task force for the Food and Drug Administration
produced estimates of intake of natural and added sugars, includ-
ingHFCS,sucrose,andothercornsweeteners(30).Usingdataon
HFCS and added sugar availability (by food group), Glinsmann
et al created category-wide estimates of the proportion of added
sweetener that is HFCS. For example, of the 1684.24 million kg
(3713.12 million lbs) of added sweetener available to the bakery
and cereal industry in 1984, 278.00 million kg (612.87 million
lbs, or 16.5%) was HFCS. Thus, a factor of 0.165 was multiplied
by the amount of added sugar in the "grains" food group to obtain
an estimate of HFCS. As with the previous method, 100% of
added sugar in soda and fruit drinks was assumed to be HFCS.
Within food groups, we generated estimates of HFCS by apply-
ing these factors to the amount of added sugar reported in the
USDA food-composition table and summed intake by food
group.
Although we present results from both methods for compari-
son, the results reported here are based on the Glinsmann method

of estimation. This method was selected for several reasons.
First, unlike the NDS method, the proportions estimated by
Glinsmann et al had been successfully implemented in at least
one previous study of HFCS consumption (10). Secondly, NCC
data were not intended, nor established, for application to the
USDA survey data, and used a different set of food identifiers.
Additionally, the NCC data use the NDB foods, which were
divided differently from the USDA survey foods, which further
complicated the matching process. This meant that matching
with the USDA survey data was poor, resulting in a 50% match
rate. For the remaining 50% of foods, food group means were
applied. This may have resulted in a "washing out" of our HFCS
estimates.Furthermore,thetotalfructosevalueprovidedbyNDS
required assumptions (not based on scientific literature) about
the proportion of added sugar that is HFCS versus some other
form of fructose sweetener.
Estimated timing of HFCS use in the food supply
Precise information on the introduction of HFCS as an added
sweetener into the food supply was not available. Various
sources cited the early 1980s as the years when Coca-Cola and
Pepsi introduced the reformulation of their beverages to include
HFCS (20, 31), at which point HFCS was the sole added sweet-
ener in these beverages. For nonbeverage categories, there is
evidence of HFCS use started in the late 1980s. However, infor-
mation that would allow for accurate estimates of the amount
usedwasnotavailableuntilthelastperiod,1999­2004.Forthese
years, adequate evidence shows that HFCS was used much more
widely in the general food supply. Thus, we applied the mean
proportion of fructose (Pf
) for each food group's added sugar for
this period only.
Food group creation
Foods were initially grouped by using the University of North
Carolina (UNC) food-grouping system (32), which places foods
and beverages into nutrient-based subgroups on the basis of their
fat and fiber contents. However, these food groups varied widely
with respect to added sugar values. Because these groups would
ultimately be used to provide estimates of the fructose proportion
for foods that did not have a direct match between NDS and
USDA, the original food groups were modified. Fat and fiber
distinctions were removed, and foods were regrouped according
toaddedsugar.Forexample,thelow,medium,andhigh-fatdairy
UNCfoodgroupswereseparatedintodairynosugaradded,dairy
low sugar added (below the mean for grams of added sugar), and
dairy high sugar added (at or above the mean for grams of added
sugar). Finally, the beverage groups, which were combined with
all other food groups in the original UNC food grouping system
(ie, low-fat milk was grouped with low-fat dairy products, such
as cottage cheese), were redefined and categorized in accordance
with the Beverage Guidance Panel (33). For the examination of
trends, the sugar groups were combined (ie, no sugar, low sugar,
and high sugar desserts presented as desserts).
Consumption data
We used data from the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey
[NFCS 1965­1966 (n  13 549) and 1977­1978 (n  29 553)],
the Continuing Survey of Food Intake in Individuals [CSFII
1989­1991 (n  14 689)] and the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey [NHANES 1999­2004 (n  25 482)] to
examine trends in estimated HFCS consumption. Dietary intake
data from NCFS 1965­1966 were collected by using a single,
interviewer-administered 24-h recall. Data from NCFS 1977­
1978 and CSFII 1989­1991 were collected over 3 consecutive
days by use of a single interviewer-administered 24-h recall
followed by a 2-d self-administered diet record. Information on
all foods and beverages consumed, regardless of location, was
recorded. We used only the first day's 24-h recall to maintain
consistencyindatacollectionmethodsbetweenthesestudyyears
(ie, 1965­1991).
Beginning with NHANES 1999­2000, a validated (34), semi-
automated(fullyautomatedin2002),multiple-passmethodofan
interviewer-administered 24-h dietary collection was intro-
duced. This 5-step computer-assisted dietary recall instrument
has been cited as an improvement over previous methods for
collecting dietary recall information because it includes multiple
probes for potentially forgotten foods and beverages and asks
about preparation methods and specifics about each eating oc-
casion (35). For NHANES 2003­2004, 2 d of data were col-
lected: the first day of intake was collected by using the computer
assisted, in-person interviewer-administered 24-h recall, and the
second days' intake was collected by using a telephone-
administered(computer-assisted)survey.Becauseofdifferences
in data collection methods, only the first day of intake was used.
Analyses were completed by using SAS (v.9.1.3; SAS Insti-
tute Inc, Cary, NC) and Stata (v.9.2; Stata Corp LP, College
Station, TX). We weighted means to be nationally representa-
tive, and adjusted the standard errors to account for the stratified
and clustered sample design. Data are presented as means per
yearforAmericansaged2yandolder,withsignificancesettothe
  0.01 level. Trends for Americans aged 2­18 y versus 19 y
and older did not differ; thus, results for all ages are combined.
RESULTS
Availability of HFCS in our food supply
When it was initially introduced in the 1970s, HFCS repre-
sented 1% of all caloric sweeteners available for consumption
in the United States. Replacement of sugar and other sweeteners
with HFCS increased rapidly in the 1980s, however, and by 2004
HFCS (of any kind) represented 42% of all caloric sweeteners
(Table 1; 23, 36). Initially, HFCS-42 was the only HFCS

component, but by the early 1980s, HFCS-55 became the major
source and represented 59.5% of HFCS used in 2004, down just
slightly from its peak use in 2000 (61.9%). Although these data
are useful for studying trends, they likely overestimate actual
intake.Furthermore,itisimportanttorealizethatalthoughHFCS
represents roughly 40% of the per capita caloric sweetener con-
sumed in the United States, this proportion is significantly
greater in selected foods and beverages.
Trends in HFCS availability
Data on the availability of HFCS, free fructose, and total fruc-
tose are shown in Figure 1 (37). These data were compiled by the
USDA Economic Research Service; the HFCS data are those
from Table 1. Total fructose is defined as the sum of free fructose
plus fructose contained in the disaccharide sucrose (assumed to
be50%).FreefructoseisdefinedasthemonosaccharideinHFCS
plus other small amounts found in honey (assumed to be 38.5%),
for example. Total fructose has changed relatively little over the
past 34 y compared with the change in HFCS availability. Since
1970, total fructose availability has increased nearly 18%, from
45.7 to 53.7 g per capita per day, whereas HFCS availability
increased from 0.5 to 52.4 g per capita per day over the same time
period. Availability of both total and HFCS appear to be slightly
declining since 2000, although the continued direction of the
trend is difficult to predict.
Consumption of total added sugar and HFCS
Between 1977 and 2000, consumption of added sugar in-
creased until a slight decline between 2000 and 2004 (Table 2).
Added sugar accounted for 17% of total energy intake in 2004,
up from 15% in 1965 (down from a high of 18% in 2000).
Between 1965 and 1977, there was a significant decline in the
intakeofaddedsugar,butsince1977therehasbeenastatistically
significant increase (compared with the previous year) in total
added sugar and added sugar as a percentage of total carbohy-
drates consumed. By 2004, added sugar represented almost 32%
of carbohydrates for Americans aged 2 y and older.
Between 1989 and 2000, total caloric intake from HFCS
jumped dramatically, from 77 kcal per person per day to 189 kcal
per person per day (Table 2). At its peak in 2000, HFCS repre-
sented 9% of total energy intake and 16.5% of total carbohydrate
consumption among Americans. Between 2000 and 2004, there
wasasmall(10kcalperpersonperday),althoughnotstatistically
significant, decline in the estimated caloric intake from HFCS.
Despitethisslightdecline,HFCSstillaccountedfor8.3%oftotal
energy intake and 15.7% of total carbohydrates consumed in
2004.
These trends were similar between age groups (Figure 2).
Calories from added sugar decreased from 1965 to 1991, but then
increased significantly between 1991 and 2000. The greatest
changes were observed among those aged 2­18 y and 19­39 y:
declines of 49 and 52 kcal per person per day, respectively, with
a subsequent increase of 164 and 217 kcal per person per day,
respectively. At each time point, these age groups have had the
greatest caloric intake from added sugar. By 2004, intake of
added sugar had leveled off or had begun to decline slightly.
Consumption of HFCS increased considerably between 1991
and 2000, with the largest change (172 kcal per person per day)
among 19- to 39-y-olds. Americans aged 2­5 and 60 y had the
lowest increase in consumption. HFCS intake in these 2 age
groups remained stable from 2000 to 2004, whereas there was a
slight decline over this same period in the 2­18 and 19­39 y old
age groups.
Added sugar and HFCS from beverages
Nearly all beverages, save vegetable juice, unsweetened cof-
fee, unsweetened tea, and water (data for these beverages are not
shown), were estimated to contain at least some amount of
HFCS.Forallbeverages,therewasatrendofincreasedpercapita
caloric consumption from HFCS between 1989­1991 and 2004.

By far, fruit drinks and soft drinks accounted for the greatest
caloric intake of HFCS, providing 40 kcal per person per day and
158 kcal per person per day, respectively (Figure 3). These
values represent an increase of 18 kcal from fruit drinks and 82
kcal from soft drinks over a 15-y period. As a percentage of total
energy, soda represented nearly 7% of per capita energy intake
and 13% of energy from carbohydrates among Americans aged
2 y and older. Increases in other beverages also occurred, al-
though these beverages accounted for a smaller proportion of
calories. For example, in 1989­1991, HFCS from sports drinks
provided 1 kcal per person per day; this figure increased to 3
kcal in 2004 (Figure 4). Nearly 10 kcal of HFCS was consumed
from sweetened tea in 2004, up 6 kcal from 1989­1991 values.
There was a trend of increased caloric intake from added sugar
obtained from beverages between 1989 and 2004. Aside from the
obvious contributors--soda and fruit drinks--many additional
beverages provided a sizeable number of calories from added
sugar (Figure 4). Sweetened tea, for example, was estimated to
provide roughly 14 kcal per person per day in 2004, an increase
of 7 calories since 1989. Sports drinks, which also accounted for
roughly 3 calories of HFCS in 2004, accounted for 4.5 calories of
added sugar, up 4.4 calories from 1977. High-fat milk (including
chocolate milk) accounted for an additional 5 kcal per person per
day. In 2004, alcohol and sweetened coffee were estimated to
account for an additional 3 kcal per person per day collectively
(data not shown).

Added sugar and HFCS from foods
We assume that HFCS was introduced into food manufacturing
in the early to mid 1990s. Thus, we estimated HFCS consumption
from foods starting with the NHANES 1999­2000 survey. Certain
food groups showed the largest differences in estimated HFCS by
useofthe2estimationtechniques.Acomparisonoftheestimatesfor
these food groups is shown in Figure 5.
In general, the contribution of HFCS to caloric intake from
variousfoodgroupsremainedrelativelystablebetween2000and
2004. However, compared with the caloric contribution of HFCS
from soda and fruit drinks, foods provided considerably fewer
calories from HFCS overall. Desserts (including pudding, cakes,
cookies, and pies) provided the greatest percentage of total en-
ergy (1%) and percentage of carbohydrates (3%) each year
(Figure3).TotalcaloriesfromHFCSindessertsdeclinedslightly
between 2000 and 2002, but then increased to 29 kcal per person
per day by 2004. By far, desserts provided the largest source of
calories from HFCS; almost 94% more calories compared with
the next highest food groups, ready-to-eat cereals and breads
(including bread, bagels, tortillas, biscuits, and muffins), which
accounted for roughly 2 kcal per person per day of HFCS each in
2004 (Figure 5). Certain fast food groups (ie, hamburgers and
cheeseburgers) also provided a small number of calories of
HFCS (Figure 4), although this accounted for an insignificant

proportion of total energy intake in all 3 y (1% of total energy
intake).
Although HFCS does not appear to contribute meaningful
amounts to per capita caloric intake from many foods, added
sugar is estimated to provide considerably more calories. Within
food groups, the overall trends in added sugar consumption are
not as clear as the trends within beverage groups. For example,
the per capita daily caloric intake of added sugar from snacks
increased from 1965 to 2000 (2.3 kcal per person per day) but
then decreased slightly to 2 kcal per person per day in 2004
(Figure 4). Similar trends were observed for cereal (Figure 4),
salad dressing (data not shown), and dairy food groups (data not
shown). There was an increase in calories of added sugar from
these foods between 1965 and 2000 (2002 for dairy), followed by
a leveling off or slight decrease by 2004.
Desserts (Figure 3) provided significantly more calories
from added sugar compared with any other food group, al-
though trends were not consistent: per capita daily calories
decreased by 36 calories from 1965 to 1991 (not shown),
increased by 20 calories to 74 calories between 1991 and
2000, and decreased again by 7 calories in 2004. Similar
cyclical trends were observed for breads (Figure 4). Interest-
ingly, breads accounted for considerably more calories of
added sugar in 1965 than did cereals, but by 2004, these 2 food
groups contributed equally to per capita energy intake from
added sugar. Overall, however, foods accounted for 1% of
total energy and 1% of total carbohydrates, save cereal,
breads, and desserts, which accounted for between 1% (ce-
real) and 6% (desserts) of total carbohydrates in 2004.
Estimates among consumers
Amongconsumers,caloricintakefromaddedsugarandHFCS
amongthetopfoodsandbeverageswasconsiderablygreaterthan

small (10%) percentage of persons reported consuming sweet-
ened tea, sweetened tea provided an estimated 134 kcal per con-
sumer per day compared with an estimated per capita amount of
14 kcal per person per day from added sugar (95 kcal per con-
sumer per day versus 10 kcal per capita per day from HFCS).
Likewise, 24% of cereal consumers obtained 40 more calories
(53versus13)fromaddedsugarthanthepercapitaestimates,and
for the 46% of reported soda consumers, there was a 98% in-
crease in energy from added sugar (as HFCS). Per capita and per
consumer estimates did not differ greatly for breads.
Distribution of added sugar is important
There were important differences in calories from added sugar
among those in the top 20% of the caloric distribution (Table 4).
In 1965, the highest quintile consumed an average 640 more kcal
per person per day from added sugar than the lowest quintile.
This discrepancy had increased to 840 kcal per person per day in
2004. Between 1965 and 2004, calories of added sugar from
beverages increased by 158% within the top quintile (393 kcal
per person per day difference from 1965 to 2004) of the distri-
bution, but calories of added sugar decreased by 28% (163 kcal
per person per day difference from 1965 to 2004) from foods.
With respect to beverages, persons in the lowest quintile (Q1)
of the population consumed zero calories of added sugar, and
although the bottom 60% of the distribution (Q1 to Q3) increased
caloric intake from added calories, persons in the upper 2 quin-
tiles (Q4 and Q5) appeared to be driving the overall trends (Table
4). Similar differences between the highest and lowest quintiles
were observed within foods; however, persons at the lowest end
(Q1) of the distribution obtained some calories from added sugar
(20 kcal per person per day in 2004). Between 1965 and 2004, the
trend in for consumption of added sugar from foods all quintiles
appeared to be decreasing (Table 4).
Total caloric intake from HFCS increased almost 100% to 505
kcal per person per day between 1989­1991 and 2004 among the
top 20% of the population. Similarly to added sugar, the overall
trends were driven by the top quintiles: persons in the top 60% of
the population increased caloric intake from HFCS, whereas
those in the bottom 40% decreased caloric intake from HFCS
slightly between 1989­1991 and 2003­2004. Beverages pro-
vided 450 calories of HFCS to persons in the top 20% of the
population and zero calories to those in the lowest 20%. Every-
one consumed at least some calories of HFCS from foods (3
versus 122 kcal; data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Consumption of added sugar, generally, and HFCS, specifi-
cally, has been hypothesized as a contributing factor to the rising
rates of obesity observed over the past few decades. Mechanis-
tically, this hypothesis is based on differences in the rates of
digestion and absorption between fructose and glucose (38­41)
and the observation that increased consumption of sugar-
sweetened beverages is associated with weight gain over time
(15, 42­44). These topics are beyond the scope of this article, but
are addressed elsewhere in this supplement. The purpose of this
article was to examine the trends and patterns in HFCS and added
sugar consumption in both beverages and foods.
We report that daily per capita intake of calories from HFCS
and added sugar has followed a general upward trend since the
mid-1960s. Despite a drop in sugar consumption between 1965
and 1977, added sugar accounted for 17% of total daily energy
intake and 32% of total carbohydrate intake among Americans
aged 2 y and older. These values represented an increase of 31%
(from the lowest value in 1977) and 23% (from the lowest value
in 1991), respectively. The trend in HFCS consumption has been
steadier; between 1991 and 2000 there was a 120% increase in
calories from HFCS, and since 2000, calories from HFCS have
remained relatively stable. These values represented 8.5% of
totalenergyand15.9%ofcarbohydratesin2004--anincreaseof
67% and 57%, respectively, from estimated intake in 1989.
Ourresultsareconsistentwiththosereportedelsewherebyour
research team. In a study examining worldwide shifts in added
sugar availability and consumption, Popkin and Nielsen (45)
reported an increase from 235 calories from added sugar in 1977
to 318 calories from added sugar in 1996. Similar trends in the
number of calories from added sweetener by food group were
also reported. Using the same Glinsmann method as reported
here, Bray et al (10) examined HFCS consumption between 1977
and 1998 for a select set of food groups, namely soft drinks, fruit
drinks, and desserts. As reported in our article, Bray et al found
ageneralincreasingtrendinaddedsugarandHFCSconsumption
from the 3 food sources they examined. The present study ex-
panded on these results by estimating HFCS contribution to
caloric intake from numerous additional food sources over a
longer time period.
The patterns we have observed are also consistent with recent
literature on trends in the location and types of foods being

consumed. Between 1977 and 1996, salty snacks, pizza, and
sugar-sweetened beverages showed the largest increases in con-
sumption among all age groups, but the largest changes were
observed in the younger (2­18 and 19­39 y) age groups (46).
Location of energy consumption is also shifting, with energy
from fast food places and restaurants replacing energy consumed
at home (46). Furthermore, people reported that foods that can be
easily obtained from these food sources (eg, hamburgers and
cheeseburgers) were almost exclusively consumed away from
home, which suggests that the types of foods prepared at home
have shifted (46).
Our study shows that calories from added sugar and HFCS
from similar types of foods (eg, hamburgers, snacks, sodas) has
continued to rise, or at least has reached a plateau, since 1996.

Many of these foods, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages,
account for a greater percentage of total energy intake in 2004
than they did even 20 or 30 y ago. Furthermore, because foods
and beverages are typically not consumed independently of one
another, contribution of any food or beverage to an individuals'
total daily energy intake is potentially much larger.
Our article has several limitations. First, because of the lack of
available data, the amount of HFCS in foods had to be estimated.
Because little work has been done to estimate HFCS intake, we
used 2 different estimation methods--one based on availability
(Glinsmann method) and one on measured fructose (NCC
method) in foods. For some key food groups, these methods
resulted in significantly different estimates (eg, the desserts food
group). These differences are likely the result of differences
between the 2 estimation techniques, each of which required
acceptance of certain assumptions.
With respect to the NCC (measured fructose) method, a direct
measure of fructose was not available for all foods reportedly
consumed in the USDA database; linkage codes between NCC
and USDA data were available for only 1000 foods. For foods
for which no direct link was possible, we applied an average
fructose value (based on the food group to which that particular
food was assigned), that likely resulted in a misestimation of
fructose,andHFCS,formanyfoods.However,itisimpossibleto
predictthedirectionofthismisestimationforanyindividualfood
or beverage item. To reduce misestimation, we grouped foods
according to their added sugar content. However, within some
food groups, a large range of added sugar and fructose would
result in a dilution of average values within a food group. Addi-
tionally, for some foods from NHANES 2003­2004, direct mea-
sures of added sugar were not available. For these foods, we
applied sugar values from the closest matching 8-digit USDA
food code from the previous time point (NHANES 2001­2002).
When there were no comparable foods in previous USDA files
(eg, Propel Fitness water; Gatorade, Chicago, IL), we used nu-
tritional information provided by the manufacturers and calcu-
lated added sugar values from this information. Our estimates of
HFCS consumption using the Glinsmann Method are based on
availability of data from the mid-1980s; they are likely to under-
represent HFCS availability within these sectors today.
Second, our data are limited by differential collection methods
between exams and differential time spans over which data were
collected. The first 3 exam periods (1965, 1977, and 1989­1991)
covered a span of 15 y, whereas the last 3 periods (1999­2000,
20001­2002, and 2003­2004) covered just 5 y, which may not
have been long enough to observe sensitive changes in consump-
tion patterns. To create more comparable time spans between
studies, we combined the NHANES data into a single survey and
reexamined trends. Although the trends in added sugar were
slightly clearer with use of the combined surveys, HFCS could
not be estimated (recall that HFCS was not widely used in food
products until the late 1990s). Thus, we elected to keep each
NHANES survey separate. Some of the differences in observed
consumption may also have been due to changes in data collec-
tion methods. In 2000, the automated multiple pass method was
used for dietary collection. This tool is designed with internal
prompts to help decrease the incidence of underreporting,
thereby increasing the accuracy of data collection. Although this
may result in an increase in reporting frequency of foods and
beverages, it is unlikely to account for the large changes reported
here.
In general, the availability and consumption of HFCS and
added sugar has increased over the past 3 decades. We report that
the types of foods and beverages contributing to daily energy
intake from HFCS have shifted over the past several decades:
desserts accounted for roughly 4% of total energy intake in 1965.

6.8%oftotalenergyintakeinthesameyear.Althoughsweetened
beverages,suchassodaandfruitdrinks,currentlyaccountforthe
largest proportion of energy from HFCS, we report that other
beverages (sports drinks) and foods (desserts, breads, and ready-
to-eat cereals) are also contributing considerable amounts of per
capita energy intake. These are foods that are often consumed as
snacks rather than meals (37, 46), so ultimately, it seems that
HFCS(andotheraddedsugar)isnotwhat'sfordinner,it'swhat's
in addition to dinner. (Other articles in this supplement to the
Journal include references 47­50.)
We thank Phil Bardsley for his persistence, patience, and programmatic
skillsandwithoutwhomthisarticlecouldnothavebeenrealized;JohnHimes
and the entire University of Minnesota Nutrient Data System team for pro-
viding the measured fructose and added sugar values for foods in the NDS;
Frances Dancy for her administrative assistance; and Tom Swasy for graph-
ical support.
The authors' responsibilities were as follows--BMP and KJD: organized
the study concept and design and participated in data acquisition, interpre-
tation of results, and in preparation of the manuscript; KJD, in collaboration
with PB, and under the guidance of BMP: conducted statistical analysis.
None of the authors had any conflicts of interest to report.
