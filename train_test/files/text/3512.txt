To achieve academic success, learners often need to seek
help from appropriate resources. Help seeking is an impor-
tant self-regulatory learning strategy associated with moti-
vation and academic achievement. Help seeking refers to
strategic self-regulatory behaviors that learners use to
obtain information from formal and informal sources to
adapt and acquire knowledge and skills (Hsu, 2005;
Karabenick, 2003; Karabenick, 2013; Karabenick & Berger,
2013; Karabenick & Dembo, 2011). According to Schunk
and Usher (2013), self-regulated learning refers to "the
process whereby learners systematically organize and
direct their thoughts, feelings, and actions to attain their
goals" (pp. 1-2). Seeking appropriate help when it is needed
has been considered to be a strong indicator of individual
differences within human agency while pursuing goals. In
education, help seeking has been associated with motiva-
tion, self-regulation, goal orientation, and self-efficacy
(Butler, 1998; Hsu, 2005; Karabenick, 2003; Ryan &
Pintrich, 1997; White, 2011). Learners, who seek help
while disregarding threat to self-esteem, tend to be highly
successful and adapt better to their environment than learn-
ers who avoid seeking help (Karabenick & Knapp, 1991).
Help seeking practices, motivational beliefs, and the use
of learning strategies are important predictors of teacher can-
didate retention. There is growing support for requiring
teacher candidates to take and pass state-level examinations
to advance in their teacher candidacy. As a result, high stakes
testing has secured its place as a critical gate to teacher edu-
cation and certification (Cochran-Smith & Zeichner, 2005).
As early as the sophomore year, an aspiring teacher can be
denied access to a teacher education program due to failure
of a state exam, a restriction which limits access to the field
for many potential candidates (Hsu, 2005). In some states,
teacher education programs base admission on whether
teacher candidates can pass an examination, which measures
the basic skills acquired during high school. In New York
State, the LiberalArts and Science Test (LAST) is the current
assessment, while in 45 other states, the Praxis I is required
(Mitchell, Robinson, Plake, & Knowles, 2001).
While academic deficits are often addressed through
remedial programs and workshops, teacher education pro-
grams would benefit from early awareness of self-regulatory
behaviors evidenced by incoming students. Exploration of
these areas of development, linkage to constructs prominent
in the study of self-regulation, academic motivation, and

Not All Avoidance Help Seekers Are
Created Equal: Individual Differences in
Adaptive and Executive Help Seeking
Marie C. White1 and Héfer Bembenutty2
Abstract
This study examined 86 teacher candidates' use of help seeking strategies and beliefs for preparing to pass a state certification
examination. Using cluster analysis, we identified three different kinds of help seekers among the participants. One of the
clusters represented teacher candidates for whom help seeking was an important and adaptive self-regulatory strategy and
essential to their successful academic performance. The other two clusters represented the group of teacher candidates
who had help-avoidance tendencies, but they were different in that for one group, seeking help implied inadequate use and
maladaptive self-regulatory strategies while for the other, coping and adaptive self-regulatory strategies were utilized to ask
for help when needed. The results revealed that students' tendencies for help seeking vary according to their teacher's self-
efficacy beliefs, and use of self-regulatory strategies, such as delay of gratification. These findings suggested that help seeking
is indeed a self-regulatory learning strategy used by learners to pursue valuable academic goals, and that differences do exist
in approaches to help avoidance.

strategy use can help teacher educators determine the degree
to which specific areas of development impact success in
teacher education programs for individual students.
Today, little is known about teacher candidates' behavior
and beliefs to seek help when needed to pass a required state
exam. It would be important to learn teacher candidates' ten-
dencies to seek help whether it is to master test materials, to
obtain instrumental benefits, or simply if they approach or
avoid seeking help when in need of assistance. If teacher
candidates have tendencies to avoid help seeking when suc-
cessful performance is in jeopardy, it would be important to
know what they actually do to succeed in passing a signifi-
cant state teaching examination. Specifically, it is essential to
uncover whether, in spite of exhibiting help seeking avoid-
ance tendencies, teacher candidates eventually seek help to
master the materials or to receive assistance only to obtain a
passing score pass without mastering the content.
Consequently, the aim of the study was to examine teacher
candidates' help seeking tendencies while preparing to take
the LAST. The social cognitive theory of self-regulation of
learning serves as the theoretical framework to delineate
understanding the role of help seeking as an individual dif-
ference in academic achievement among teacher candidates.
Theoretical Background
Humans are distinctly able to engage in self-regulation of
their actions, motivations, behaviors, and beliefs, and to iden-
tify and use self-directed learning strategies while pursuing
short- and long-term goals (Bandura, 1997). Throughout his-
tory and across cultures, self-regulation of behavior has been
assumed to increase learning and performance (Zimmerman
& Schunk, 2011). Recent research has provided strong sup-
port for the importance of self-regulation as a catalyst for
human agency and self-direction (Bembenutty, Cleary, &
Kitsantas, 2013). The development of self-regulation begins
in the home with guidance and modeling from primary care-
takers, and from family and community members (Bandura,
1997). The development of self-regulation continues with a
paramount importance when children enter school. It is at this
developmental level that teachers have an important role to
serve as mentors and models of self-regulation to scaffold
learners during challenging times when seeking help is
needed (DiBenedetto & White, 2013).
Self-regulation involves key meta-cognitive, motiva-
tional, and behavioral subprocesses, such as time manage-
ment, organizing, rehearsing, and coding information,
attending to and concentrating on instruction, establishing a
productive work environment, and using social sources
effectively (Zimmerman, 1998). Students' academic effec-
tiveness depends on their use of these self-regulatory pro-
cesses and their motivational beliefs regarding the
effectiveness of those processes. In school settings, help
seeking is an important self-regulatory strategy (Karabenick,
2013; Karabenick & Dembo, 2011). An essential feature of
all self-regulatory approaches is a recursive feedback loop.
This feedback loop provides the learner with information
about his or her task performance that can be used to make
adjustments (Zimmerman, 2008). This cyclical process
enables self-regulated students to metacognitive monitor the
effectiveness of their learning strategies and make adaptive
changes that lead to academic success.
To better understand the interrelation of these self-
regulatory processes, Zimmerman (2000) proposed a model
involving three cyclical phases, which includes help seeking
in the performance phase. Help seeking was not viewed as a
lack of self-regulation, but rather as a social strategy for
gaining needed assistance from an appropriate source
(Newman, 2008). According to Zimmerman, self-regulated
learning strategies are not limited to asocial forms of educa-
tion but can include social forms of learning, such as seeking
guidance from peers, coaches, and teachers.
Theory and research have positioned help seeking as an
important social self-regulatory strategy related to self-
regulatory processes among teacher candidates (Bembenutty,
2006; White, 2011). Help seeking has been listed among the
most important strategies that can contribute to university
student success (Karabenick & Dembo, 2011). Unfortunately,
students who are in most need of assistance are often the
least likely to seek it for a variety of reasons. This is espe-
cially true of college students aspiring to be teachers, who
often wait until it is too late to use available resources to pass
state certification exams (Tellez, 1992). When confronted
with the reality of high stakes testing, these students often
give up their dream to become teachers rather than admit
their need for social support (Orlich & Gifford, 2006). This
decision has a significant impact on the number of teachers
who enter the classroom.
According the Newman (2008), the self decides when it is
time for input from an outside source. This decision to act
shows a willingness to depend on others. Socially, self-regu-
lated students find selective help seeking to be a useful strat-
egy when they encounter obstacles in their learning process.
Students who are low in overall self-regulation are reluctant
to ask for assistance. By contrast, students who are high in
self-regulation take the initiative to do schoolwork without
prompting and continue their efforts until a task is com-
pleted. When necessary, they will selectively and actively
seek enough input to complete the task successfully. They
show initiative and persistence on learning tasks, confidence,
and resourcefulness in overcoming problems, and are self-
reactive to task performance outcomes (Zimmerman, 2008).
According to Karabenick (2013), the history of help seek-
ing as a self-regulated strategy has four major developments.
In Phase 1, the contribution of Nelson-Le Gall and Nadler
reflect the conception that help seeking was important to pro-
vide assistance for learners to progress on their own while
pursuing academic tasks. Within Phase 2, Zimmerman
(2008) provided empirical evidence that help seeking was a
strategy used by self-regulated learners. Through Phase 3,
White and Bembenutty 3
studies assessing the person and contextual motivational
influences under the achievement goal theory revealed that
help seeking was associated with learner's classroom experi-
ences (e.g., Butler, 2008; Karabenick & Dembo, 2011;
Newman, 2008). During Phase 4, it was revealed that com-
puter-mediated communications and intelligent learning sys-
tems serve as important tools used by student to seek help.
Help seeking can be conceptualized as a process of sev-
eral stages during which learners set goals, make decisions,
and adapt their approaches according to the cognitive, affec-
tive-emotional, contextual, and social competencies and
resources available to them (Karabenick & Berger, 2013;
Karabenick & Dembo, 2011). According to Karabenick's
model of help seeking (Karabenick & Berger, 2013;
Karabenick & Dembo, 2011), students first determine
whether there is a problem (Stage 1) and whether help is
needed (Stage 2) before deciding whether to seek help (Stage
3). If they make the decision to seek help, then they need to
determine the type of help they will seek (Stage 4) and from
whom they will seek help (Stage 5). Once the potential
sources of help are identified, which could be from a teacher,
a peer, or from a technology learning context, they solicit
help (Stage 6) and obtain help (Stage 7) before processing
the help received (Stage 8). This progression does not neces-
sarily occur in this particular order. At each of these stages,
learners engage in one or more self-regulatory processes. To
illustrate, in Stage 1, learners set goals and objectives to
monitor performance. In Stage 2, they engage in task analy-
sis while in Stage 4, learners need to decide on the type of
help they will seek. In Stage 8, they engage in error
analysis.
At different developmental phases, specific types of
help have been identified. Nelson-Le Gall (1985) is widely
credited with changing educators'perspective on help seek-
ing from an act which reflected immaturity, passivity, and
incompetence to one of maturity, proactivity, and compe-
tence. Building on foundational research by Fisher, Nadler,
and DePaulo (1983), Nelson-Le Gall focused on the stu-
dents' goals for seeking assistance, rather than the act itself.
She (Nelson-Le Gall, 1985) defined help seeking as a gen-
eral problem-solving strategy that allows learners to cope
with academic difficulties by gaining the assistance of oth-
ers. She drew a distinction between two forms of help seek-
ing, instrumental (adaptive) and executive (nonadaptive),
based on a learner's goals. Therefore, intentions often
determine how and why learners ask for help. Adaptive
help seeking occurs when the help requested is limited to
the amount and type of assistance needed for the student to
solve the problem independently. In contrast, executive
help seeking occurs when the requested help intends for
someone else to solve the problem. Avoidance of help seek-
ing focuses on situations when a student requires but
chooses to not seek help. Perceived benefits of help seeking
are students' beliefs about the positive outcomes of seeking
help on a task.
Research conducted by Hwang and Vrongistinos (2002)
indicated a strong relationship between frequent uses of self-
regulated learning strategies and high academic performance
among teacher candidates. This study found that future
teachers varied in their use of strategies and that strategy use
distinguished high and low performing students.
Unfortunately, not all teacher candidates have the opportu-
nity to develop self-regulation, and as a result do not engage
in productive work habits.
Research has shown help-avoidant college students are
more anxious and perform more poorly than adaptive help
seekers. Students who feel threatened by adverse conse-
quences of help seeking report across educational settings
are classified as executive help seekers (Karabenick, 2003).
Karabenick (2003) compared college students' help seeking
behavior with that of younger students. He measured strate-
gic and nonstrategic help seeking behaviors in large college
classes where support services are not easily accessed. The
results of his study showed similarities in help seeking
behaviors of learners from K-12 when compared with col-
lege students (Karabenick, 2003). Karabenick also assessed
college students' levels of help seeking threat, their inten-
tions to seek help, help seeking goals, preferred resources,
class-related motivation, and their use of learning strategies.
Using a cluster analysis, he found four clusters that could be
described as strategic-adaptive help seekers, formal help
seekers, help seeking avoidant students, and expedient help
seekers.
Relationships also exist between help seeking and self-
efficacy beliefs, self-regulation, intrinsic motivation, and
delay of gratification among teacher candidates (Bembenutty,
2006). Self-efficacy for learning is individuals' beliefs about
their capability of performing a particular task (Bandura,
1997). Teachers'self-efficacy refers to teachers'beliefs about
the capability to have a positive effect on the learning of their
students. Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk Hoy (2001)
observed, "teachers' sense of efficacy is an idea that neither
researchers nor practitioners can afford to ignore" (p. 803). A
sense of efficacy can help teacher candidates' to sustain
motivation, engage in self-regulation, and sustain a mastery
goal orientation rather than an avoidance goal orientation.
Thus, it is expected that teacher candidates' self-efficacy
beliefs would be associated with their motivational beliefs
and self-regulation of learning. Another important compo-
nent of self-regulation is intrinsic motivation, which refers to
a learner's engagement and enjoyment in a task for the sake
of learning (Sansone & Harackiewicz, 2000). Teacher candi-
dates' are expected to display intrinsic interest in academic
tasks associated with their teaching programs as they have
willingly chosen that path as their future career. Thus, it is
expected that intrinsic interest will be associated with teacher
candidates' goal orientations.
Academic delay of gratification is associated with the
self-regulatory strategy of help seeking (Bembenutty &
Karabenick, 1998). Bembenutty and Karabenick (1998)
4 SAGE Open
defined academic delay of gratification as learners' inten-
tions to postpone immediate available rewards to obtain
larger rewards temporally distant. Delay of gratification is
important for self-regulation of learning because, for exam-
ple, alternatives to academic goals are attractive, in part,
because they offer immediate gratification, in contrast to
rewards for academic goals (e.g., grades, degrees) that are
temporally remote. Delay of gratification is associated with
students' use of learning strategies such as help seeking
(Bembenutty, 2006; Bembenutty & Karabenick, 1998).
Bembenutty (2006) examined the associations between pre-
service teachers' help seeking tendencies, homework beliefs
and behavior, and their willingness to engage in academic
delay of gratification. The results indicated that preservice
teachers who have a positive attitude toward help seeking are
those who report high homework self-efficacy beliefs and
high homework intrinsic interest. Teacher candidates with a
positive attitude toward help seeking are those who reported
high willingness to delay gratification.
Over the last several years, research in help seeking
among teacher candidates suggests that help seeking is an
important self-regulatory strategy among teachers and
among teacher candidates while studying to take important
examinations (Bembenutty, 2006; Butler, 1998; White,
2011). For instance, White (2011) assessed the help seeking
behaviors of preservice teachers who were at risk of failure
of state certification examinations. The participants were
preservice teachers drawn from a small private college in
New York. The Preservice Teacher Help seeking Scale
(PTHSS; White, 2011) was administered to preservice teach-
ers who were preparing for the first of three state certifica-
tion exams.
In spite of the benefits of help seeking for learners, often,
help seeking has been described as an uncomfortable and
embarrassing act that requires a degree of courage (Flynn &
Lake, 2008; Shapiro, 1983). Researchers agree that despite
the instrumentality of help seeking, the costs cannot be mini-
mized (DePaulo & Fisher, 1980; Karabenick & Knapp,
1991). There exists a significant amount of research concern-
ing why students are reluctant to seek help, even when they
recognize it is needed and readily available (Newman, 2008).
Ryan and Pintrich (1997) investigated the role of motivation
and attitudes in adolescents'help seeking in math class. They
concluded that students who were unsure of themselves--
cognitively or socially--were more likely to feel threatened
when asking their peers for help. Ryan, Gheen, and Midgley
(1998) assessed the context of the classroom to investigate
individual and classroom influences on adolescents and
reported the avoidance of help seeking. They found students
were able to improve help seeking behaviors when their
teachers provided socioemotional nurturing. Thus, there is
evidence of widespread help avoidance and help abuse
(overuse of nonadaptive help) from students who need assis-
tance the most (Aleven & Koedinger, 2000).
Present Study
This study assessed the different help seeking tendencies of
teacher candidates enrolled. Of particular interest is teacher
candidates' use of avoidance, adaptive, and executive help
seeking strategies to master the content of a state certifica-
tion exam. Instructors' ratings of students' help seeking ten-
dencies were also examined in the study. The following
research questions guided the study:
Research Question 1: What are the associations between
LAST scores, teacher self-efficacy beliefs, self-
efficacy beliefs, delay of gratification, self-regulation,
intrinsic motivation, and help seeking tendencies?
Research Question 2: What clusters, based on the under-
lying structure of their help seeking preferences, could
differentiate teacher candidates' help seeking tenden-
cies and how are these clusters differentiated based on
the candidates' self-regulatory practices, motivational
beliefs, and academic performance?
Research Question 3: Will differences on pre-LAST
scores, candidates' self-regulatory practices, motiva-
tional beliefs, and academic performance, separately
account for unique variance on post-LAST scores?
Method
Participants and Procedure
Participants in the study were 86 teacher candidates drawn
from a small private college in an urban setting (31 males
and 55 females), which enroll predominantly minority stu-
dents who were junior and senior intending to teach in ele-
mentary schools. The college maintains a liberal admissions
policy, giving students from diverse populations an opportu-
nity to enter higher education. Teacher candidates were
invited to participate in the study by an instructor. After sub-
mitting signed informed consent forms, teacher candidates
were given a series of assessments to complete in the class-
room during LAST exam preparation.
Measures
Teacher Candidates' Reported Help Seeking.This scale has
four subscales. Adaptive Help Seeking: Teacher candidates
reported their adaptive help seeking from their instructors
(an example item is, "When I ask for help with assignments
pertaining to this class project, I prefer to be given hints or
clues rather than the answer," M = 6.70; SD = 1.9;  = .89)
and from their peers (an example item is, "When I ask a peer
for help with my work, I don't want my peer to give away the
whole answer," M = 6.80; SD = 1.35;  = .87; White, 2011).
Executive Help Seeking: Teacher candidates reported execu-
tive help seeking tendencies from their instructors (an exam-
ple item is, "When I ask the instructor for help with
White and Bembenutty 5
assignments pertaining to this class project, I prefer the
instructor do the work for me rather than explain to me how
to do it," M = 1.99; SD = 1.53;  = .92) and from their peers
(an example item is, "When I ask a peer for help with my
work, I don't want my peer to give away the whole answer,"
M = 1.89; SD = 1.61;  = .97; White, 2011). Avoidance Help
Seeking: Teacher candidates reported executive help seeking
tendencies from their instructors (an example item is, "If I
need help to solve a problem, I prefer to skip it rather than to
ask for help," M = 2.55; SD = 1.54;  = .94; White, 2011).
Perceived Benefits of Help Seeking: Teacher candidates
reported executive help seeking tendencies from their
instructors (an example item is, "I like to ask for help about
my test preparation because it helps me understand the mate-
rial better," M = 5.83; SD = 1.81;  = .94; White, 2011).
Instructor's Rating of Teacher Candidates' Help seeking Strate-
gies. This assessment contains four different subscales repre-
senting eleven instructor's perception of the teacher
candidates: (a) Adaptive Help Seeking (an example item is,
"When this teacher candidate asks for help, he or she only
wants as much help as is necessary to complete the work
independently," M = 6.22; SD = 1.77;  = .99); (b) Executive
Help Seeking From Their Instructor (an example item is,
"When this teacher candidate asks for help with items similar
to those on the LAST, he or she prefers to be given the answer
rather than an explanation of how to do the work indepen-
dently," M = 1.85; SD = 1.65;  = .99); (c) avoidance help
seeking from the instructor (an example item is, "This teacher
candidate does not ask questions regarding the LAST, even if
he or she does not understand the items," M = 2.11; SD =
2.03;  = .99); and (d) benefits of help seeking from their
instructor (an example item is, "When this teacher candidate
is struggling with course-related material, he or she shows
the benefits from help received," M = 6.02; SD = 2.12;  =
.99; White, 2011).
LAST (Pre and Post). The LAST is taken by teacher candidates
who aspire to enroll in a New York State­approved teacher
education programs. Items on this test were adapted from a
state standardized test for teacher candidates' licensure. The
scores on a practice LAST were obtained at the first (M =
191.19; SD = 35.59) and last (M = 202.84; SD = 41.46) ses-
sions of a series of workshops dedicated to prepare the can-
didates for the test.
Self-Efficacy for Learning.The Self-Efficacy for Learning
Scale (Bembenutty, 2010) was used to assess self-efficacy
for learning (an example item is, "I am sure that I can learn
all the material to pass the LAST," M = 5.86; SD = 1.05;  =
.80).
Self-Efficacy for Teaching.The Teachers' Sense of Efficacy
Scale (Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk Hoy, 2001) was used
to assess teacher candidates' self-efficacy beliefs (an
example item is, "How much can you do to get through to the
most difficult teacher candidates?" M = 7.05; SD = 1.18;  =
.87).
Intrinsic Motivation for Learning.The Intrinsic Motivation
Scale (Bembenutty, 2010) was used to assess intrinsic moti-
vation (an example item is, "I enjoy studying for the LAST,"
M = 3.80; SD = 1.34;  = .85).
Self-Regulation for Learning. The Self-Regulation for Learning
Scale (Bembenutty, 2010) was used to assess self-regulation
for learning (an example item is, "How often do you keep a
record about how well you are doing in preparation for the
LAST?" M = 3.70; SD = 1.48;  = .93).
Academic Delay of Gratification.Teacher candidates reported
their willingness to delay gratification on the Academic
Delay of Gratification Scales (Bembenutty & Karabenick,
1998). Teacher candidates chose between an immediate
available reward and a reward that is temporarily distant
(e.g., "Going to a party now" or "Staying home to study for
a test tomorrow so I can get good grade"; M = 3.25; SD = .54;
 = .74).
Homework Distraction.Teacher candidates reported their
level of distraction in preparation for the LAST test with two
items (an example item is, "How many hours per week are
you spending watching television every day?" M = 1.91; SD
= 1.33;  = .64; Bembenutty, 2010).
Results
Objective 1: Intercorrelations Between the
Variables
Table 1 displays the correlations between the variables. As
expected, Pre-LAST and Post-LAST were highly correlated
(r = .73). Teacher candidates' reported adaptive help seeking
from instructors and peers were highly correlated (r = .81);
thus, we merged both variables resulting in a single variable
of adaptive help seeking. Executive help seeking from
instructors and peers were also highly correlated (r = .82);
thus, we merged both variables to create a single index of
executive help seeking. The instructors'rating of teacher can-
didates' adaptive help seeking and benefits were also highly
correlated (r = .85). Thus, instructors' rating of benefits of
help seeking was not used in further analysis. Similarly, the
instructors'rating of teacher candidates'avoidance and exec-
utive help seeking were also highly correlated (r = .79).
Thus, instructors' rating of avoidance was not used in further
analysis.
Pre- and Post-LAST scores were significantly related (r
= .73). Pre- and Post-LAST scores were inversely related
to executive and avoidance help seeking, respectively.
Teacher self-efficacy was positively related to teacher

positively related to self-efficacy for learning (r = 28),

seeking (r = -.28). Self-efficacy was positively related to
intrinsic motivation (r = .45), self-regulation (r = .44), and
benefit for seeking help (r = .29).
Objective 2: Cluster and Discriminant Analysis
To classify teacher candidates' based on their help seeking
tendencies and follow the cluster analysis on help seeking by
Karabenick (2003), four clusters were expected using the
teacher candidates' four self-reported indexes of help seek-
ing. A K-means cluster analysis generated a noninterpretable
four-cluster solution; however, a three-cluster solution was
highly interpretable. This analysis produced an estimate of
within-subjects similarity and dissimilarity according to the
teacher candidates' reported help seeking strategies.
Cluster 1 (labeled avoidance-executive help seekers) con-
sisted of teacher candidates with a moderate avoidance and
executive help seeking tendencies. Cluster 2 (labeled adap-
tive help seekers) consisted of teacher candidates with a high
adaptive and benefits of help seeking tendencies but have
low executive and avoidance help seeking tendencies.
Cluster 3 (labeled avoidance-adaptive help seekers) con-
sisted of teacher candidates moderate in avoidance and ben-
efits, low in executive, but high in adaptive help seeking
(which is confirmed with a MANOVA, see Table 2). Using
Wilks' statistic, there was a significant effect of cluster on
teacher candidates' reported use of help seeking strategies, 
= .089, F = 46.30, p < .001; 
p
2 = .70.
The MANOVA was followed by a series of ANOVAs, one
per dependent variable (see Table 3) and by the Benferroni's
significant differences to test group comparisons. The
MANOVA compared the differences among the clusters in
teacher candidates' LAST performances, motivational
beliefs, self-regulation strategies, and teachers' rating of
their help seeking strategies. An examination of mean differ-
ences among the clusters indicated that there were mean dif-
ferences among the three clusters on teacher self-efficacy.
Cluster 2 reported higher teacher self-efficacy beliefs than
Cluster 1, which suggests that teacher candidates who seek
help for the sake of learning are also those who have higher
teacher self-efficacy beliefs (see Figure 1).
Teacher candidates (Cluster 3) who moderately avoid
seeking help but engage in high adaptive help seeking
reported higher willingness to delay gratification than the
teacher candidates (Cluster 1) with moderate avoidance but
who do seek help primarily to just get answers. Teacher can-
didates with high preference for using adaptive help seeking
strategies (Clusters 2 and 3) reported higher self-efficacy for
learning and consider help seeking more beneficial than
avoidance-executive teacher candidates who seek help only
to get answers (Cluster 1). Using Wilks' statistic, there was a
significant effect of cluster on teacher candidates' reported
use of help seeking strategies,  = .066, F = 10.65, p < .001;

p
2 = .74.
To confirm the cluster solutions, the MANOVA was fol-
lowed up with discriminant analysis, which revealed two dis-
criminant functions. Overall, 96.5% of the teacher candidates
were correctly classified and the correlations between help
seeking and the discriminant functions are consistent with
the MANOVA's findings (see Table 4). The discriminant
functions plot is displayed in Figure 2.
Objective 3: Regression Analysis Predicting Post-
LAST Scores
We examined whether differences on variables assessed in
the study separately accounted for unique variance on post-
LAST scores, even after controlling for the effects of each
other using hierarchical regression (entered in four steps).
Gender was included in the analysis to control for its effects.
Tables 5 and 6 display the results of the final model with
four steps. In Step 4, gender was a significant and positive
predictor of post-LAST scores ( = .20, p = .011), which

suggests that female teacher candidates (male coded 0,
female coded 1) obtained higher post-LAST scores than
males did (see Table 7). As expected, pre-LAST predicted
post-LAST ( = .74, p = .001). Self-regulation was a positive
predictor of post-LAST scores ( = .15, p = .073).
With regard to the teacher candidates'self-reported use of
help seeking strategies, executive help seeking was a nega-
tive predictor of post-LAST scores ( = -.12, p = .010),
whereas avoidance help seeking ( = .15, p = .070) and ben-
efits of help seeking ( = .18, p = .044) were positive predic-
tors. The final model accounted for 71% of the variance on
the outcome. The instructor's rating of the teacher candi-
dates' use of help seeking strategies and all variations of
interaction terms were eliminated from the final model
because they did not account for unique variance on post-
LAST scores.
Discussion
A major concern for those who instruct future teachers is
whether teacher candidates will develop the necessary self-
regulatory skills during their training at a level which results
in meeting individual states' requirements for certification.
One of those important self-regulatory skills is an ability to
seek help when it is needed. The results of this study are
consistent with Karabenick's (2003) self-regulatory view of
help seeking and the perspective that links strategic factors in
self-regulated learning with help seeking. Help seeking is an
adaptive strategy for coping with difficulty; however, teacher
candidates often refrain from asking for help to avoid the
perception of weakness or incompetence.

Figure 2. Mean differences of three-cluster solutions.
In this study, we identify three different kinds of help
seekers among the participants. Each of the three groups is
unique in the way it approaches help avoidance. Cluster 1
represents the group of teacher candidates who have help-
avoidance tendencies and to whom seeking help implies
inadequacy. Consistent with Karabenick's (2003) findings,
these teacher candidates would rather fail than be judged as
less capable by instructors and peers; they engage in execu-
tive rather than in adaptive help seeking. Cluster 2 represents
teacher candidates for whom help seeking is an important
and adaptive self-regulatory strategy and essential to their
successful academic performance. Cluster 3 represents the
group of teacher candidates who have help seeking avoid-
ance tendencies, experience similar stress and anxiety
regarding asking for help as their counterparts in Cluster 1,
yet are able to use coping and adaptive strategies to ask for
help when needed.
Retention in teacher education programs is often threat-
ened by failure of the initial assessment of basic skills
(Cochran-Smith & Zeichner, 2005; Hsu, 2005), which is
often attributed to poor high school preparation. To increase
retention in teacher education programs, identifying

differences in the help avoidance behaviors may provide a
way to recognize teacher candidates who are not likely to
take advantage of opportunities provided to increase their
likelihood of success in passing teacher certification exams
(Hsu, 2005; White, 2011). The strength of this study rests in
the findings that the help seeking goals of these three groups
of help seekers are not equal: Teacher candidates with avoid-
ance tendencies could determine to deal with their anxiety
and feeling of threats by engaging in adaptive or executive
self-seeking behavior.
This study has several limitations. The sample size is
small and causation cannot be derived from this correlational
study. Experimental research should be conducted in which
the different help seeking tendencies are controlled under
restricted settings to rule out potential factors unexamined in
this study such as the level of anxiety of the teacher candi-
dates, classroom characteristics, and the dispositions of the
teacher candidates and their instructors.
Important educational implications are derived from the
results of this study. Teacher education providers are chal-
lenged to make significant adjustments to the way they pre-
pare teacher candidates for certification. New policies dictate
the way teachers are educated, evaluated, and trained before
and after taking charge of a classroom. In addition, there are
higher expectations of the individual teacher candidate's
White and Bembenutty 11
impact on student learning during the years of preparation
and clinical training. The demands made on teacher candi-
dates have escalated (Darling-Hammond & McLaughlin,
2011); therefore, teacher preparation programs must find a
way to assist those who might become overwhelmed with the
process. Including training in self-regulatory strategies such
as goal setting, help seeking, self-monitoring, and delaying
gratification can provide teacher candidates with tools that
can improve performance and raise self-efficacy.
Teacher candidates, who display patterns of help avoid-
ance that have been observed in children and traditional col-
lege students, are at risk of dropping out of teacher education
programs. One can also suggest that candidates who do com-
plete the program and display help-avoidance tendencies
will contribute to the costly high attrition rate of new teach-
ers. Although the number of teacher candidates in the cluster
of avoidance-executive help seeking is limited, it is not with-
out concern because some of these teacher candidates are
members of the pool from which future teachers are drawn.
The "help seeking dilemma" is instilled in early socialization
practices which reflect norms which are cultural and primar-
ilyWestern (Karabenick & Berger, 2013;Volet & Karabenick,
2006). Educators who train teacher candidates to become
successful classroom teachers should work toward dispelling
the stigmas associated with help seeking at the earliest
opportunity. Often, when a learner weighs the costs and ben-
efits of seeking help, the consequences of revealing weak-
ness puts at risk the appearance of competence and can result
in the choice to avoid any appearance of incompetence. In
some cases, delaying gratification can be linked to help
avoidance; the learner's desire to appear competent can be
associated with maintaining social status. In addition, the
results of the study should encourage teacher educators to
model and promote the effective uses of the self-regulatory
strategy of seeking and obtaining assistance, specifically for
students who could be isolated and persisting toward aca-
demic failure.
Closer attention should be paid to the teacher candidates
who avoid asking for help as a means toward masking failure.
When we examine motivational factors which result in avoid-
ing seeking help, consideration should be given to the signifi-
cance of the social cost to the teacher candidates who admits
to struggling with different aspects of their training. In this
way, teacher preparation programs can identify those candi-
dates who will struggle alone rather than join a study group,
meet with instructors, or take advantage of the resources read-
ily available to contribute to their success in the program.
In summary, this study supported the notion that learners'
individual differences for help seeking vary according to
their goal orientations, self-efficacy beliefs, and use of self-
regulatory strategies, such as their willingness to postpone
immediately available rewards to pursue long-term aca-
demic outcomes. These findings suggest that help seeking is
indeed a self-regulatory learning strategy used by learners to
pursue important and valuable academic and social goals.
Furthermore, consistent with the work of Mischel (1996),
these findings placed delay of gratification as an important
individual difference associated with academic achieve-
ment. Consistent with Bandura (1997), self-efficacy is
revealed in this study as having a direct association with
academic performance and as an important human agency
for seeking help. These findings call attention to the fact that
when seeking help, learners have different goals. With
regard to help seeking avoidance, all goals are not created
equal. Some learners with help seeking avoidance tenden-
cies choose to cope with a perceived threat to their self-
esteem and anxiety by seeking help primarily to get answers
without an understanding, whereas other teacher candidates
choose to seek help to get knowledge and skills.
