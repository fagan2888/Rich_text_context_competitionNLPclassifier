Are Americans Feeling Less Healthy? The Puzzle of Trends in Self-rated Health

Initially submitted January 9, 2009; accepted for publication May 6, 2009.
Although self-rated health is proposed for use in public health monitoring, previous reports on US levels and
trends in self-rated health have shown ambiguous results. This study presents a comprehensive comparative
analysis of responses to a common self-rated health question in 4 national surveys from 1971 to 2007: the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, National Health Interview
Survey, and Current Population Survey. In addition to variation in the levels of self-rated health across surveys,
striking discrepancies in time trends were observed. Whereas data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System demonstrate that Americans were increasingly likely to report ``fair'' or ``poor'' health over the last decade,
those from the Current Population Survey indicate the opposite trend. Subgroup analyses revealed that the great-
est inconsistencies were among young respondents, Hispanics, and those without a high school education. Trends
in ``fair'' or ``poor'' ratings were more inconsistent than trends in ``excellent'' ratings. The observed discrepancies
elude simple explanations but suggest that self-rated health may be unsuitable for monitoring changes in pop-
ulation health over time. Analyses of socioeconomic disparities that use self-rated health may be particularly
vulnerable to comparability problems, as inconsistencies are most pronounced among the lowest education group.
More work is urgently needed on robust and comparable approaches to tracking population health.

Measures of health status are widely used in clinical trials
and studies on quality of care (1, 2). There is also increasing
interest in using health status measures to track changes in
population health and health service needs and to monitor
progress toward broad goals for the health of communities
and nations (3­5). Interest in tracking population health
extends to comparisons across countries and measurement
of disparities within countries (6­10). Further, population
health measures capturing nonfatal outcomes are essential
to understanding how well public health and medical care
systems are performing (11, 12).
Global measures of self-rated health, based on responses
to a single survey question, have been proposed as reliable
and valid measures of population health (13­15) and rec-
ommended for use in health monitoring by the US Centers
for Disease Control, the World Health Organization, and the
European Commission (4, 13, 16). The most commonly
used survey item asks people to characterize their health
as ``excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.'' The resulting
categorical responses are often dichotomized as ``fair'' or
``poor'' versus all other categories (7, 17­19). A recent
Institute of Medicine report included the percentage of
adults reporting ``fair'' or ``poor'' health among the set of
8 indicators recommended for tracking the progress
of health in the United States (20).
At the individual level, self-rated health based on a single
item has been found to be a strong predictor of health-care
utilization, functional ability, and subsequent mortality,
even after controlling for other measured indicators of
health status and socioeconomic variables (21­26). Based
on the strength of these associations, self-rated health has
been used extensively in policy analyses as an overall

measure of health outcomes (27­30). Despite its appeal as
a simple measure with consistent predictive power in cohort
studies, however, existing evidence on trends in self-rated
health in the United States--where time series are available
from multiple survey programs--points to inconsistent pop-
ulation-level patterns across data sources and studies. Zack
et al. (31) analyzed self-rated health responses from the Be-
havioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and found worsen-
ing trends from 1993 to 2001. Analyses of trends in the
National Health Interview Survey (32), on the other hand,
indicate that self-rated health has remained relatively stable.
Such discrepant findings based on responses to the same item
in different nationally representative surveys raise questions
about thevalidity ofinferences about population health based
on self-rated health.
To further understand the potential use of self-rated health
for population-level monitoring, we present a comprehen-
sive analysis of levels and trends in self-rated health re-
sponses in 4 separate nationally representative US surveys.
In particular, we focus on characterizing discrepancies be-
tween surveys, comparing discrepancies in self-rated health
with those in other types of questions, analyzing differences
in specific subgroups, and considering possible explanations
for inconsistencies across surveys.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data sources
We compared responses to a common survey item on
self-rated health in 4 national US health surveys from
1971 to 2007: the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES), Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil-
lance System (BRFSS), National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS), and Current Population Survey (CPS). Table 1
provides a summary of the key characteristics of each
survey.
NHANES comprises a series of cross-sectional surveys of
the civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 2 months
or older (33). NHANES includes an in-person interview and
a subsequent examination component, with both physical
and laboratory measurements. The first 3 rounds were con-
ducted at various intervals since 1970. Beginning in 1999,
NHANES became a continuous survey with data released
every 2 years.
BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional telephone survey
started in 1984 (34). Currently, the survey is conducted by
health departments in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia by using a random-digit dialing method to obtain
a state-representative sample of the civilian, noninstitution-
alized population aged 18 years or more. The state samples
can be combined to form a nationally representative sample.
NHIS is an annual cross-sectional household interview
survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population,
implemented since 1957 (35). The survey instrument is
updated approximately every decade, with the last signifi-
cant revision occurring in 1997. The current survey consists
of a core questionnaire and supplementary material that may
change each year.
CPS is a monthly nationally representative survey regard-
ing the US labor force, including the noninstitutionalized
population aged 16 years or more (36). The survey is con-
ducted through both personal and telephone interviews,
independently in each state. In the survey design, members
of a household are interviewed for 4 months, left out of the
sample the next 8 months, and interviewed again for the
following 4 months. We restrict our analysis to the March
supplement, which includes self-rated health.
Although NHIS and CPS elicit information on all house-
hold members from a single household respondent, we in-
cluded only self-reports in our analyses. An anomaly in the
1998 CPS data set--the household respondent indicator is
blank for 92% of the sample--makes it impossible to dis-
tinguish self-reports from proxy responses, so we have

excluded these data from our analysis. Self-reports and
proxy responses in CPS show minimal differences in levels
and trends in all other years (Web Figure 1). (This is the first
of 3 supplementary figures; each is referred to as ``Web
figure'' in the text and is posted on the Journal's website,
http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/.)
Health measures
In each survey, analyses were based on responses to the
question, ``Would you say your health in general is excellent,
very good, good, fair, or poor?'' (The wording was re-
arranged slightly in BRFSS, as, ``Would you say that in gen-
eral your health is. . ..'') Respondents who answered ``don't
know/not sure'' or refused to answer were excluded from the
analysis (these respondents constituted less than 1% of the
overall survey samples in every year and every survey).
Initial analyses were based on dichotomizing self-rated
health responses as ``fair'' or ``poor'' versus all other cate-
gories, following common practice (7, 17­19). In further
analyses, we compared this approach with a range of
alternatives.
For comparison, we also examined responses to other
questions common to the different surveys, including self-
reported diabetes and body mass index computed from self-
reported weight and height.
Age-standardized measures were computed on the basis
of the 2000 US population by 5-year age intervals from 20
years to 70 years or older.
Statistical methods
Sample weights were applied in each data set to account
for unequal probabilities of selection, nonresponse, and non-
coverage. The provided weights included ratio adjustments
to match population distributions by age, sex, and race/
ethnicity in each survey, except in some state samples from
BRFSS, which matched only on age and sex. Variance
estimation was undertaken by using Taylor-series lineariza-
tion methods to account for complex survey designs includ-
ing clustering, stratification, and unequal weights (37). For
CPS, which does not include variables on stratification and
clusters in the public-release data set, we developed syn-
thetic design variables following the approach of Joliffe
(38), based on resorting the data and assigning consecutive
observations to synthetic clusters in a way that approximates
the design effects in the actual CPS sample. Following
Joliffe, we used cluster sizes of 4 housing units and sorted
by household income to induce intracluster correlation
in self-rated health, based on the underlying association
between income and health.
For each survey year, we computed confidence intervals
around age-standardized proportions using different
response categories. We examined patterns by sex and by
3 broad age groups: 20­49 years, 50­64 years, and 65 years
or older. We also examined differences by race/ethnicity and
educational level. Race/ethnicity was categorized as non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other.
Education was categorized as less than high school, high
school, and more than high school.
To assess trends over the last decade overall and by sex,
age, race, and education, we fit logistic regression models
relating the probability of ``fair'' or ``poor'' self-ratings to
calendar year over the period 1998­2007. We did not fit
models to NHANES, as data are available only for 2-year
periods starting in 1999­2000. We excluded CPS data from
1998 because self-reports could not be distinguished from
proxy responses in that year, as noted above. Separate mod-
els were fit for each subgroup within each survey. Analo-
gous logistic regression models were fit to the probability of
reporting ``excellent'' health.
All statistical analyses were undertaken by using Stata
Release 10/SE (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
In 2007, the age-standardized proportion of respondents
reporting fair or poor health ranged from 12.0% (95% con-
fidence interval (CI): 11.3, 12.7) in NHIS to 16.4% (95% CI:
15.9, 16.8) in BRFSS for males and from 13.5% (95% CI:
12.9, 14.1) in NHIS to 16.9% (95% CI: 16.6, 17.2) in
BRFSS for females. NHANES estimates in 2005­2006
(the most recent available) were similar to those in BRFSS,
but with greater uncertainty.
Trends in age-standardized probabilities of reporting fair
or poor health are plotted in Figure 1. BRFSS shows increases
of 15% among women and 22% among men in reports of fair
or poor health over the period 1993­2007. NHIS, on the other
hand, shows reductions in fair/poor health from 1982 to 1990,
followed by slight increases for the next 2­3 years. Since
1993, changes in NHIS have been relatively modest, except
for a sharp drop in 1997 coinciding with a major redesign of
the survey, which preserved the exact wording but relocated
the self-rated health question within the survey.
NHANES shows declines in fair/poor ratings from the
first round of the survey (1971­1975) through the third
round (1988­1994) in both sexes. In men, trends since
1999­2000 have been marked by rising reports of fair/poor
health through 2003­2004, followed by a reversal of this
pattern in 2005­2006; patterns for women have oscillated
since 1999­2000. Finally, CPS indicates mostly steady
reductions in fair/poor ratings for males since 1999 and flat
trends for females over this period.
In order to consider whether differences among the sur-
veys may apply more generally to other self-reported health-
related items, we compared these results with trends in other
variables. For example, Figure 2 presents results from NHIS,
BRFSS, and NHANES for females on age-standardized
proportions reporting diabetes, which are much more con-
cordant than self-ratings of health. Results are similar for
men (not shown). Figure 2 also presents a comparison of
body mass index computed from self-reported weight and
height. Although the levels and trends are similar in NHIS
and BRFSS, estimates from NHANES are higher, by roughly
the same increment in each year of comparison. Thus, in
contrast to self-reported diabetes, self-reported body mass
index appears subject to some systematic variation across
surveys. Unlike self-rated health, however, the trend across
surveys appears largely consistent despite variation in esti-
mated levels.
Trends in Self-rated Health 345
Am J Epidemiol 2009;170:343­351
Analyses by age, race, and education
Disaggregation by age, race/ethnicity, and education
reveals more subtle patterns (Figure 3). In the youngest
age group, CPS and NHIS show the lowest fractions of
respondents reporting fair or poor health. Conversely, in
the oldest age group, the fraction reporting fair or poor
health is highest in CPS. Overall, the sharpest divergence
in trends across surveys appears in ages 20­49 years, with
the proportion reporting fair/poor health in 2007 around
50% higher in BRFSS compared with NHIS or CPS, in
contrast to relatively modest differences in 1993. In older
age groups, differences in levels are smaller across surveys,
in relative terms, but variation in time trends remains.
Disaggregating by race and ethnicity, we observe the
smallest inconsistencies among non-Hispanic African
Americans and the largest among Hispanics. For Hispanic
respondents, discrepancies among surveys have widened
over time, with a nearly 2-fold difference in proportions
reporting fair or poor health in NHIS versus BRFSS in
2007, compared with roughly equal proportions in the
early 1990s. Levels and trends in the 4 surveys among
non-Hispanic whites are moderately discrepant.
Disaggregating by educational level, the greatest discrep-
ancies appear among those respondents without a high
school diploma. The magnitudes of cross-survey differences
in levels and trends between those with a high school
diploma and those with at least some college are similar.
Although the poststratification weighting procedures in
CPS, NHANES, and NHIS accounted for age, sex, and race/
ethnicity, adjustment for race was incorporated in some states
but not others in BRFSS (all states adjusted for age and sex).
Education was not factored into the weights for any of the
surveys. In our sample on self-rated health, we find some
differences across surveys in the sample composition by
raceand education (WebFigure2). Changesinthesevariables,
however, are modest and gradual over the period of analysis,
and cross-survey differences remain fairly constant over
time, which suggests that discrepancies in self-rated health
trends are not explained bydifferences in sample composition.
Alternative coding schemes for categorical self-ratings
of health
Although researchers typically dichotomize self-rated
health as ``fair'' or ``poor'' versus all other responses, we
considered whether alternative approaches may yield more
consistent results. Figure 4 shows trends in the 4 surveys
since 1998 based on 4 different dichotomous coding
schemes. (Web Figure 3 also presents trends in the average

self-rated score, coding ``excellent'' as 5, ``very good'' as 4,
and so on, which indicate similar discrepancies across sur-
veys as for ``fair/poor'' ratings.) The ordering of the differ-
ent surveys in terms of the age-standardized responses is
largely preserved across the different choices of dichoto-
mous indicator, with NHIS producing the most favorable
ratings, followed by CPS, BRFSS, and NHANES; the ex-
ception is the indicator of ``poor'' self-ratings, for which
CPS is least favorable. Figure 4 suggests visually that the
proportion of respondents rating themselves as ``excellent''
may yield more consistent trends across surveys than the
standard choice of ``fair/poor.'' This possibility is evaluated
formally in the statistical models described below.
Estimated time trends, 1998­2007
For the 3 surveys with annual reporting (CPS, NHIS,
BRFSS), we modeled time trends from 1998 to 2007 using
logistic regression of self-rated health (with either ``excel-
lent'' or ``fair/poor'' ratings as the dependent variable) as
a function of calendar year. Separate models were fit for each
survey, by subgroup. The estimated odds ratios for calendar
year in the regressions were translated into average annual
rates of change in the odds of reporting either ``excellent'' or
``fair/poor'' health. For example, an odds ratio of 1.02 on year
implies an average annual rate of change of (1.02 À 1.00) 3
100 ¼ 2%. Figure 5 summarizes the regression results.
Overall, and in both men and women, the regressions
confirm the observation that trends in ``excellent'' ratings
are more consistent across surveys than trends in ``fair/
poor'' ratings. In men, CPS shows significant declines in
the proportion of fair/poor ratings, in contrast to the signif-
icant increases seen in BRFSS, whereas declines in excel-
lent ratings are seen in all surveys, albeit at varying rates.
Across age groups, significant differences appear in fair/
poor ratings from the 2 younger age groups, while excellent
ratings are less discrepant across surveys overall. Consider-
ing differences across race and ethnic groups, using either
dichotomous measure, we found that the greatest discrep-
ancies in trends appear among Hispanic respondents, espe-
cially in fair/poor responses. Finally, comparisons across
education groups indicate that, for those respondents who
have completed at least high school, trends are unambigu-
ously worse: More people report ``fair/poor'' health at the
same time that fewer people report ``excellent'' health. On
the other hand, trends among those without a high school
diploma offer the most ambiguous conclusions in any of
the subgroup analyses: In terms of both the fair/poor and
excellent responses, CPS points to a strong, significant
favorable trend, whereas BRFSS shows a strong, significant
unfavorable trend in this group.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we undertook a comprehensive comparative
analysis of self-rated health in 4 nationally representative
US surveys and observed widely discrepant results overall.

Trends in Self-rated Health 347

In addition to variation across surveys in self-rated health
levels, we also noted striking inconsistencies in trends.
Whereas BRFSS finds that Americans were increasingly
likely to report ``fair'' or ``poor'' health over the last decade,
CPS indicates the opposite trend. Unpacking these discrep-
ancies through subgroup analyses reveals the greatest incon-
sistencies in trends among younger respondents, Hispanics,
and those without a high school education. Our results also
challenge the standard practice of focusing on the percent-
age of respondents with self-ratings of ``fair'' or ``poor,'' as
this indicator appears prone to greater cross-survey discrep-
ancies than other indicators constructed from the same
survey responses, such as the proportion with ``excellent''
self-ratings.
Wide variations in levels and trends in self-rated health
measured in nationally representative surveys using the
same survey item demand an explanation. There are at least
3 possibilities. First, despite national sample frames and
application of sample weights, the aggregated results from
some surveys may not adequately reflect the national aver-
age. For example, concerns have been raised in the past
about possible noncoverage and nonresponse bias in tele-
phone surveys such as the BRFSS. Recent work, however,
has indicated that the bias produced by nonresponse in ran-
dom-digit telephone surveys is probably modest (39, 40).
Although we observed some differences in the demographic
composition of the weighted samples in the 4 surveys, these
differences were stable over time and therefore cannot
explain divergent time trends in self-rated health. Moreover,
the consistent trends across surveys observed in other mea-
sures, such as diabetes prevalence, mirror a previous finding
of consistent cross-sectional estimates in NHIS and BRFSS
for 13 of the 14 different health measures examined--with
self-rated health being the notable exception (41).
Second, the differences in results across survey plat-
forms may signify a survey mode effect particular to
self-rated health. The potential importance of different
modes of administration has been noted previously for
other specific types of questions, and indeed we observe
significant differences across surveys in reported body
mass index levels. In order to attribute divergent time
trends across the survey platforms to mode effects for
self-rated health, however, the mode effects need to be
acting differentially over time. In contrast to the body mass
index example of parallel time trends across surveys,
responses on self-rated health are evidently growing more
discrepant over time. We are not aware of any existing
studies that account for mode-item effects that change over
time in such divergent manners.
A third possibility is that there may be framing and
ordering effects in the different questionnaires that interact
with attributes of the respondents, so that biases across plat-
forms are shifting. It is difficult to construct more precise
hypotheses regarding the nature of the individual and pop-
ulation attributes that would progressively change framing
and ordering effects over time. The major shift in NHIS
responses in 1997, accompanying a relocation of the self-
rated health item within the overall structure of the inter-
view, indicates that ordering effects for the self-rated health
item can be large. Cross-survey differences in the steady
changes in responses over time would require a more subtle
form of framing or ordering effect. These effects might
derive, for example, from some changing cultural or linguis-
tic attributes of individual respondents. The widening incon-
sistencies in trends among Hispanic respondents offer some
evidence in favor of the potential importance of cultural or
linguistic factors, but more definitive conclusions await
further qualitative and quantitative investigation.

Comparing trends by educational level, we find that dis-
crepancies across surveys are most pronounced among
respondents without a high school diploma. This finding
has potentially profound implications for analyses of socio-
economic disparities in health that rely on self-rated health
responses. Trends in CPS show improvements among lower-
educated respondents at the same time that self-ratings are
worsening among more educated respondents--which has
the net effect overall of reducing disparities across educa-
tion groups. In contrast, BRFSS shows the sharpest declines
in health among the least educated group, which implies
a widening gap across socioeconomic strata.
Although our analysis of existing survey programs cannot
provide a clear indication of the causes of incomparabilities
across surveys and over time, it nevertheless offers an im-
portant reminder that, at the present time, substantial cau-
tion is warranted in using self-rated health to monitor trends
in population health. One concrete suggestion that emerges
from our study is to reconsider the standard approach of
dichotomizing self-rated health as ``fair/poor'' versus other
responses. Although some recent studies have examined the
continuity of self-rated health and found evidence of sym-
metry in responses at the positive and negative ends of the
scale (42, 43), our study indicates that trends in self-reported
excellent health appear less prone to inconsistencies across
surveys than trends in self-reported fair/poor health. This
finding challenges the prevailing approach to using this vari-
able in empirical studies in public health, epidemiology, and
medical sociology.
Given the importance of tracking nonfatal health out-
comes at the population level, what are the available options
for refining these tools for future use? Two main avenues
have been pursued to date. First, there has been a steady
evolution of more detailed instruments that either ask mul-
tiple questions about general health (44, 45) or ask about
more specific domains of health or symptoms (46­48).
Population-level data for these instruments are not yet avail-
able for long periods of time or from multiple sources in the
same country to test if they suffer from similar problems.
Recent efforts to understand relations across various
multiitem health measurement scales have characterized
differences across instruments in cross-sectional analyses
(49­51), but extension of these analyses to compare time
trends requires further longitudinal study. Second, strategies
such as anchoring vignettes (52, 53) have been proposed
recently to enhance the comparability of self-reported sur-
vey responses in health and other areas. It is not yet known
whether such strategies can successfully remedy the bulk of
comparability problems across settings or over time.
The epidemiologic transition has advanced far enough
(54­56) that, for most countries, critical questions regarding
the population's health encompass not only how long people
live but also their experience of health while they are alive.
Although self-rated health continues to appeal as a health

measure that contributes unique information on individuals'
perceptions of their own health and has strong predictive
power for future outcomes, our study suggests that self-rated
health may not be suitable for tracking changes in popula-
tion health over time. In seeking to identify efficient mea-
surement strategies for this latter purpose, more
development work on new robust and comparable
approaches is urgently needed.
