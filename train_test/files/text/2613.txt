to the Common Cold

Background: Sleep quality is thought to be an impor-
tant predictor of immunity and, in turn, susceptibility to
the common cold. This article examines whether sleep
duration and efficiency in the weeks preceding viral ex-
posure are associated with cold susceptibility.
Methods: A total of 153 healthy men and women (age
range, 21-55 years) volunteered to participate in the study.
For 14 consecutive days, they reported their sleep dura-
tion and sleep efficiency (percentage of time in bed ac-
tually asleep) for the previous night and whether they
felt rested. Average scores for each sleep variable were
calculated over the 14-day baseline. Subsequently, par-
ticipants were quarantined, administered nasal drops con-
taining a rhinovirus, and monitored for the develop-
ment of a clinical cold (infection in the presence of
objective signs of illness) on the day before and for 5 days
after exposure.
Results: Therewasagradedassociationwithaveragesleep
duration: participants with less than 7 hours of sleep were
2.94 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-7.30) more
likely to develop a cold than those with 8 hours or more
of sleep. The association with sleep efficiency was also
graded:participantswithlessthan92%efficiencywere5.50
times (95% CI, 2.08-14.48) more likely to develop a cold
than those with 98% or more efficiency. These relation-
ships could not be explained by differences in prechal-
lenge virus-specific antibody titers, demographics, sea-
son of the year, body mass, socioeconomic status,
psychological variables, or health practices. The percent-
age of days feeling rested was not associated with colds.
Conclusion: Poorer sleep efficiency and shorter sleep du-
ration in the weeks preceding exposure to a rhinovirus
were associated with lower resistance to illness.

IT IS COMMONLY THOUGHT THAT
poor sleep increases our suscep-
tibilitytothecommoncold.How-
ever, there is little direct evidence
for this assertion. Experimental
studies have demonstrated that sleep dep-
rivation results in poorer immune func-
tion, such as reduced natural killer cell ac-
tivity,suppressedinterleukin-2production,
and increased levels of circulating proin-
flammatory cytokines.1-3 Sleep depriva-
tion has also been found to attenuate an-
tibody response to both hepatitis A4 and
influenza immunizations.5 The only di-
rect evidence that sleep habits are associ-
ated with cold susceptibility derives from
a secondary analysis of data from a rhino-
virus(RV)-challengestudyinwhichasingle

METHODS
DESIGN
During the prechallenge baseline period, we assessed virus-
specific neutralizing antibody titers, demographics, and height
and weight in healthy volunteers. We also interviewed the vol-
unteers about their sleep quality during the previous night on
14 consecutive days. Other interview and questionnaire data col-
lected during the prechallenge baseline included health prac-
tices and psychological factors. The participants were then quar-
antined in separate rooms, exposed to RV-39, and monitored for
5 days to assess infection and signs and symptoms of illness.
PARTICIPANTS
The data were collected between 2000 and 2004. The study in-
cluded 78 men and 75 women (age range, 21-55 years; mean
[SD] age, 37.06 [8.95] years) who responded to advertise-
ments, were judged to be in good health, and had no missing
data (2 participants were excluded because of missing data) on
relevant variables. They were studied in 6 groups and received
$800 for their participation. The study received institutional
review board approval, and informed consent was obtained from
each participant.
EXPERIMENTAL PLAN
The temporal sequence of events for a study trial is presented
below.

v Check blood sample for preexisting antibody to virus
v Demographics
v Height and weight
v Perceived social status
14 Daily interviews (beginning 20-23 days before viral
exposure)

v Check blood sample for antibody to virus
The volunteers underwent medical screenings and were ex-
cluded if they had a history of nasal surgery or any chronic dis-
order (eg, asthma, cardiovascular disorders, or sleep apnea);
had abnormal findings on urinalysis, complete blood cell count,
or determination of blood enzyme levels; were pregnant or cur-
rently lactating; were positive for human immunodeficiency vi-
rus; or were taking medication regularly (including sleep medi-
cation). They were also excluded if they had been hospitalized
for psychiatric problems during the last 5 years or were cur-
rently taking medications for psychiatric problems. To maxi-
mize the infection rate, we also assessed specific levels of se-
rum antibody to the challenge virus and excluded the
participants with titers higher than 4. Demographics, weight,
height, and perceived social status were also measured at screen-
ing, while sleep, health practices, and other psychological mea-
sures were assessed within the 23-day period just before the
viral challenge.
During the first 24 hours of quarantine (prechallenge), the
volunteersunderwentanasalexaminationandnasallavage.Base-
line symptoms, nasal mucociliary clearance, and nasal mucus
production were also measured. None of the volunteers re-
ported cold signs or symptoms, and no viral pathogen was iso-
lated from any of the obtained nasal lavage samples. The par-
ticipants were then given nasal drops containing 125 times the
dose of RV-39 needed to infect 50% of tissue cultures exposed
to the virus. On each day of quarantine, they recorded their
respiratory symptoms and were assessed for nasal mucociliary
clearance and nasal mucus production, and nasal lavage samples
were collected for virus culture. Approximately 28 days after
the challenge, blood samples were collected for serologic test-
ing. The investigators were blinded to all measures.
SLEEP MEASURES
The participants were interviewed by phone on 14 consecu-
tive evenings, with the first interview occurring 20 to 23 days
before viral exposure. They were asked the following ques-
tions based on key items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality In-
dex and the Pittsburgh Sleep Diary7,8: What time did you lie
down to go to sleep last night? What time did you get out of
bed this morning? How many minutes of sleep did you lose
between the time you lay down to go to sleep (interviewer stated
actual time) and the time you got out of bed (interviewer stated
actual time) because you had difficulty falling asleep or you woke
up and could not get back to sleep? Did you spend any time in
bed between lying down to go to sleep (interviewer stated ac-
tual time) and getting out of bed (interviewer stated actual time)
intentionally awake (eg, reading or watching television)? If yes,
for how many minutes? Did you feel rested from your sleep
when you awoke this morning (yes or no)?
The sleep scores were calculated for each of the 14 inter-
view days. Sleep duration was scored as the number of hours
slept (from the time the participant lay down to go to sleep un-
til the time he or she got out of bed minus the minutes of sleep
lost minus the minutes he or she was intentionally awake), and
sleep efficiency was scored as sleep duration divided by time
in bed (from the time the participant lay down until the time
he or she got out of bed).7 We then averaged across the 14 days
(at least 8 days of complete data were required; mean [SD] num-
ber of days, 13.44 [1.31]) to create the average sleep duration,
the average sleep efficiency, and the percentage of days that the
participant felt rested.
CONTROL VARIABLES
We controlled for viral immunity as assessed by the prechal-
lenge antibody titer; age; body mass index2; race; income; edu-
cation; sex; season of exposure (ie, spring, summer, autumn,
or winter); psychological variables previously found to be as-
sociated with risk for colds, including perceived social status,
perceived stress, positive emotional style, extraversion, and
agreeableness9-11; smoking rate; alcohol consumption; and ex-
ercise. The participants described their primary racial or eth-
nic group by choosing from the following 6 categories: (1) white,
Caucasian; (2) black, African American; (3) Native American,
Eskimo, Aleut; (4) Asian or Pacific Islander; (5) Hispanic, La-
tino; or (6) other. For analysis, the racial or ethnic groups were

dummy coded, with all but whites (n=81) and blacks (n=59)
collapsed into a single "other" category (n=13). Income was
assessed by the question, "Which category best describes your
yearly household income before taxes?" There were 13 catego-
ries ranging from "less than $5,000" to "$150,000 or more."
Income was defined as the median income of the identified cat-
egory. Income scores were log (base-10) transformed to nor-
malize the distribution.
Education was assessed by the question, "What is the high-
est grade or year of school you have completed?" There were
18 categories ranging from "no formal education" to "doctoral
degree." The participants were assigned a number of years of
education based on their response (eg, high school, 12 years;
associate's degree, 14 years; and PhD, 20 years).
At each of the 14 daily baseline interviews, we assessed health
practices during the last 24 hours. For exercise, participants
were asked, "Did you exercise long enough to work up a sweat
or get your heart thumping?" "If yes, "For how many minutes
did you exercise?" For smoking, "Did you smoke any tobacco
product?" If yes, "How many cigarettes, cigars, bowls of to-
bacco?" For alcohol consumption, "Did you consume any al-
coholic drinks?" If yes, "How many (a glass of wine, a 12 ounce
beer, or a shot of hard liquor each equal 1 drink)?" Scores for
each behavior were computed as the arithmetic mean across
the 14 days.
Psychological variables that were assessed by question-
naire included a 10-item measure of the perceptions of stress
in the participant's life12; the perceived socioeconomic rank as
assessed by the participants placing themselves on a 9-rung lad-
der in terms of where they stand in their country on income,
education, and occupation9; and extraversion and agreeable-
ness using the modified 5-item versions of the subscales from
Goldberg's13 "Big Five." Positive emotional style was assessed
as the extent to which respondents reported feeling happy, calm,
full of pep, lively, and cheerful during each of the 14 interview
days, averaged across days.11
VIRAL CULTURES AND ANTIBODY RESPONSE
Virus-specific neutralizing antibody titers were measured in se-
rum samples collected before and approximately 28 days after
virus exposure14; the results were expressed as reciprocals of the
final dilution of serum. Daily nasal lavage samples were frozen
at -80°C and later cultured for RV using standard techniques.14
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS
On each quarantine day, the participants rated the severity (dur-
ing the previous 24 hours) of each of 8 illness symptoms (nasal
congestion,sneezing,runnynose,earache,sinuspain,sorethroat,
cough, and chest congestion) on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very
severe).15 Dailymucusproductionwasassessedbycollectingused
tissues in sealed plastic bags.16 The bags were weighed, and the
weight of the tissues and bags was subtracted. Nasal mucocili-
ary clearance function was assessed as the time required for the
dye that was administered into the anterior area of the nose to
reach the nasopharnyx.16 Baseline-adjusted daily scores for each
measure were calculated by subtracting the appropriate base-
line score from each postexposure daily score. Negative ad-
justed scores were reassigned a value of 0. Total adjusted scores
for symptoms, mucus weight, and nasal clearance were calcu-
lated by summing the respective adjusted daily scores over the
postchallenge quarantine days.
The participants were considered to have a clinical cold if
they were both infected and met illness criteria. Infection was
defined as the recovery of the challenge virus on any of the
postchallenge days or a 4-fold or greater increase in the virus-
specific serum neutralizing antibody titer (preexposure to 28
days postexposure).16 We used an objective illness criterion in
the primary analyses that required a total adjusted mucus weight
of 10 g or more or a total adjusted nasal clearance time of 35
minutes or more.6 By this criterion, the mean (SD) total ad-
justed subjective symptom score was 36.07 (22.36) for partici-
pants with clinical colds compared with 11.52 (13.47) for those
without colds (t151
=-8.48; P.001). We also reported analy-
ses using an illness criterion based on subject self-report. This
modified Jackson criterion requires a total adjusted symptom
score of 6 or more in addition to the participants either report-
ing having a cold or reporting rhinorrhea on 3 or more days of
the 5-day period.14
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Body mass index, total symptom, mucus weight, and nasal clear-
ance scores were logged (base 10) to normalize each distribu-
tion. Logistic regression was used to predict colds (1, yes; 0,
no), and multiple linear regression was used to predict con-
tinuous markers of objective illness and total subjective symp-
tom scores. Sleep measures were treated as continuous vari-
ables, and we reported regression coefficients as well as their
standard errors and probability levels. To help clarify the na-
ture of the relationships and to provide a clearer estimate of
effect sizes, we also fit regression equations using categorical
measures of sleep (tertiles) and reported odds ratios (ORs) and
95% confidence intervals (CIs). In the primary analyses, we re-
ported the association of sleep habits and both objective and
subjective cold criteria, but the remaining analyses focused on
the objectively determined outcome.
RESULTS
RATES OF INFECTION AND COLDS
Of the 153 subjects, 135 (88.2%) were infected; 54 (35.3%)
developed a cold defined as infection and the objective cold
criterion; and 66 (43.1%) developed a cold defined as in-
fection and the subjective (Jackson) criterion.
SLEEP SCORES
The mean (SD) average sleep scores were 7.45 (1.33)
hours for duration, 94% (0.06) for efficiency, and 77%
(0.22) for the percentage of nights the participants felt
rested. The average sleep scores were only moderately
intercorrelated: r=0.37 for efficiency and duration; r=0.22
for efficiency and percentage of nights rested; and r=0.29
for duration and percentage of nights rested (all P val-
ues .01). Approximate tertiles for duration were as fol-
lows: low, less than 7 hours of sleep (n=58); middle, 7
to 8 hours of sleep (n=52); and high, 8 or more hours of
sleep (n=43). For efficiency, they were low, less than 92%
(n=48); middle, 92% through 98% (n=53); and high,
more than 98% (n=52).
BASELINE SLEEP AND COLD SUSCEPTIBILITY
Because of their traditional associations with cold suscep-
tibility, we included age and viral-specific antibody titers
as controls in all the primary analyses. We then con-
ducted a series of analyses, each entering 1 of the 16 sepa-
rate control variables. By trimming the number of covar-

iates,wereducedriskof"overfitting"themodel17;however,
including all covariates in a single model yielded the same
conclusions.
When sleep habits were treated as continuous vari-
ables, and age and antibody titers were entered as con-
trols, both shorter sleep duration and lower sleep effi-
ciency were associated with increased risk for the
development of a cold by both objective (B=-0.39 [SE,
0.15], P.02 for duration; and B=-8.93 [SE, 2.97],
P.003forefficiency)andsubjective(B=-0.36[SE,0.15],
P.02 for duration; and B=-12.33 [SE, 3.35], P.001
for efficiency) criteria. The percentage of nights that the
participants felt rested was unrelated to either cold crite-
rion (P.17).
Using tertiles of the sleep variables to predict objec-
tively defined colds illustrates that the relationships be-
tween sleep variables and colds were graded for both du-
ration (for low, OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.18-7.30; for middle,
OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.63-4.19; and for high, 1 [refer-
ence]) and efficiency (for low, OR, 5.50, 95% CI, 2.08-
14.48; for middle, OR, 3.94; 95% CI, 1.50-10.37; and for
high, 1 [reference]) (Figure).
Todeterminewhethersleepdurationandefficiencywere
independent predictors, we entered both into the same
equation predicting the objective cold criterion. Sleep ef-
ficiency (B=-7.34 [SE, 3.14], P.02) but not duration
(B=-0.27 [SE, 0.16], P.10) remained a significant pre-
dictor, suggesting that there was an overlap between the
2predictorsandthatsleepefficiencyaccountedforagreater
part of the effect.
It is common to consider sleep efficiencies of 85% or
less as abnormal. Only 8.5% of our sample fell below this
norm. To provide a risk estimate based on this common
cutoff, we compared the participants with sleep efficien-
cies of 85% or less (n=13) with the remaining participants
(dummycoded).Thosewithefficienciesof85%orlesswere
at a substantially increased risk of getting a cold relative to
the rest of the sample (OR, 5.37; 95% CI, 1.51-19.1).
In a second set of regressions, each analysis con-
tained a single control variable along with either sleep
duration or sleep efficiency (32 analyses). In all cases,
the sleep variables' associations with colds remained sig-
nificant (lowest P.03), indicating that the sleep ef-
fects were independent of all of the controls. Finally, in
models including all 16 control variables, both duration
(=-0.39 [SE, 0.18], P.03) and efficiency (=-6.93
[SE, 3.37], P.04) remained independent predictors.
BASELINE SLEEP AND INDIVIDUAL SIGNS
AND SYMPTOMS OF ILLNESS
In additional analyses, we used individual signs and symp-
toms as the outcomes instead of clinical illness. After age
and antibody titer were controlled for, poor sleep effi-
ciency (=-1.11 [SE=0.42], P.01) but not reduced
sleep duration (P.11) was associated with increased mu-
cus weight. Neither efficiency nor duration predicted the
average increase in nasal clearance time (P values .54).
Sleep efficiency (=-1.51 [SE=0.40], P.001) but not
sleep duration (P.11) was associated with the total
symptom score.
COMMENT
Poorer sleep efficiency and shorter sleep duration as as-
sessed by self-report over a 2-week period in the 23 days
before exposure to an RV were associated with in-
creased probability of developing a cold. Both associa-
tions were graded. They were also robust in the face of
16 control variables: prechallenge viral-specific anti-
body titers, age, body mass index, race, income, educa-
tion, sex, season of exposure, psychological factors (per-
ceived stress, perceived social status, positive emotional
style, extraversion, and agreeableness), and health prac-
tices (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical ac-
tivity). Associations of sleep duration and sleep effi-
ciency overlapped, with efficiency being the primary and
independent predictor. Interestingly, while measures es-
timating when a participant was sleeping (duration and
efficiency) were predictive, the more evaluative sleep mea-
sure--feeling rested--was not.
Much of what we know about sleep and health de-
rives from prospective cohort studies that have used 1
or 2 retrospective questions to assess habitual sleep du-
ration. These studies suggest that the lowest morbidity
(coronary heart disease) and mortality generally occur
among persons who report sleeping approximately 7 to
8 hours a night.18,19 Our findings on risk for the com-
mon cold suggest that there is a substantial risk associ-
ated with getting less than 7 hours of sleep per night. How-
ever, unlike some of the mortality studies,18,19 we found
that increases in sleep duration above 8 hours are asso-
ciated with better (rather than poorer) health. One ex-
planation for elevated mortality among long sleepers is
that longer-duration sleep is merely a symptom of de-
pression, itself a risk factor for mortality. Our partici-
pants were screened for psychiatric disorders; there-
fore, depression is not likely to be at play here. Another
issue is that our sample was relatively young (mean age,
37 years; maximum age, 55 years) and healthy, while evi-
dence for longer sleep being detrimental derives from
samples that have included a large segment of older adults,
many of whom have chronic illnesses.

The data were quite consistent across outcome mea-
sures, with the exception of nasal clearance function. The
reason for this anomaly is not clear, although we found
surprisingly little variability (as compared with mucus
weights or symptoms) in the day-to-day measures of na-
sal clearance, suggesting a potential insensitivity of this
measure.
What mechanisms might link sleep to cold suscepti-
bility? When the components of clinical illness (infec-
tion and signs or symptoms) were examined separately,
sleep efficiency but not sleep duration was associated with
signs and symptoms of illness. However, neither was as-
sociated with infection (data not reported). This study
was designed to maximize the infection rate (partici-
pants selected for low antibody levels) and was not pow-
ered to fairly test whether sleep is associated with infec-
tion (88% were infected). Consequently, no conclusions
about the role of sleep in infection can be made from this
null effect. However, the evidence is consistent with in-
creased clinical illness among individuals with poorer
sleep being attributable to symptom expression. A pos-
sible explanation for this finding is that sleep distur-
bance influences the regulation of proinflammatory cy-
tokines, histamines, and other symptom mediators that
are released in response to infection.1
The relative ease of assessing self-reported sleep makes
these findings particularly useful to physicians and pa-
tients,givingthemanapproximateindicatoronwhichthey
can act. Studies of both 17- to 30-year-olds and 32- to 59-
year-olds have found that about two-thirds report sleep-
ing 7 to 8 hours a night and approximately three-fourths
report 7 hours or more of sleep.20,21 Similar to the mortal-
ity studies,18,19,22 the data reported herein support the ar-
gument that 7 to 8 hours of sleep is a reasonable target.
However, they also suggest that even a minimal habitual
sleep disturbance (sleep losses of 2%-8%, 10-38 minutes
for an 8-hour sleeper) is associated with 3.9 times the risk
of developing a cold.
Evidence from actigraphy studies suggests that self-
reported sleep slightly underestimates both duration and
total number of nocturnal wakenings.23-25 Therefore, we
may want to be cautious about the exactness of self-
reportedestimatesofsleepdurationandefficiencyandtreat
them as broad relative indicators. However, the actigra-
phy studies suggesting self-report bias were conducted in
persons with sleep disorders and other psychiatric and
physical problems.23-25 Self-report biases are likely less
marked in healthy samples with less disturbed sleep. More-
over, if there are actually biases in self-reports of dura-
tion and efficiency, these same biases would enter into pa-
tients' attempts to meet specific sleep targets and hence
have little significance for clinical intervention. Finally,
since existing suggestions about what constitutes health-
promoting sleep are based on studies of self-reported sleep
habits, our data can be more readily compared with ear-
lier evidence on other morbidities and mortality.
That viral-challenge trials results are applicable to natu-
ral colds is supported by concordant evidence of these
trials, with epidemiologic data and by the close fit be-
tween symptom timing and severity patterns and those
found in epidemiologic studies.10,26 Generalization of re-
sults using RV-39 to those using other cold viruses is pro-
vided by challenge studies showing that associations hold
across multiple upper respiratory viruses,10,11 including
an earlier study of sleep efficiency and colds.6
In sum, according to our study results, measures of
sleep predicted susceptibility to the development of a cold.
Although both shorter sleep duration and lower sleep ef-
ficiency were associated with risk for illness, duration did
not predict independently of efficiency, which was a stron-
ger overall correlate of illness. Although the prospective
design does not allow causal inference, it does eliminate
reverse causation as an explanation. Because of the pro-
spective design and the controls for multiple confound-
ing factors, these results strongly suggest the possibility
of sleep playing a causal role in cold susceptibility. More-
over, the use of a maximally reliable multiple day assess-
ment of sleep habits increases our confidence in the find-
ings of this study.
