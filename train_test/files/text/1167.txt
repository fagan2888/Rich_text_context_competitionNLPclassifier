Where Are The Missing
Elders? The Decline In
Nursing Home Use, 1985
And 1995
Despite an aging population, the nation's nursing homes have
not seen an expected surge in residents.
by Christine E. Bishop
ABSTRACT: Findings from the 1995 National Nursing Home Survey suggest
that elderly Americans are reducing their use of nursing home care. The num-
bers reflect a change in the role of the nursing home, as defined in this survey.
By 1995 nursing facilities were increasingly focusing on patients with greater
disability and postacute care needs. Preferred alternatives, most notably home-
delivered care and assisted living, were likely filling the gap left by declining
nursing home use. Better population-based studies are needed to track emerg-
ing trends and ascertain whether elders with disabilities are receiving the care
they need. Such data could inform development of better public and private
financing strategies for long-term care.
The nursing home is a key provider of long-term care for
elderly persons with functional disabilities. However, the
1995 National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS) showed a de-
cline in the rate of nursing home use for elderly Americans. Falling
prevalence of disability may have been responsible for some of that
decline, but shifts to other types of care, notably home-delivered
care and assisted living, were likely more important in filling the gap
left by declining nursing home use.
These findings provide an opportunity to consider the demo-
graphic and policy forces that are reducing the prominence of the
nursing home sector. These trends appear to have supported the
natural evolution of a long-term care continuum. Ongoing data col-
lection across the breadth of the continuum would reveal whether
elders who would have been in nursing homes in 1985 (the "missing
elders") are receiving care in other settings or are going without
needed services. Such data could alert policymakers to the impacts
of new policies and trends and could inform the development of

Changes In Nursing Home Use
The NNHS, periodically conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS), gathers information from a sample of
providers stratified by bed size, certification status, ownership, and
location variables. Sample persons are randomly selected from a list
of residents in each facility on the survey date.1 Because the survey
has been conducted on the same basis at several points in time, it is
used to track trends in the provision of nursing home care. Statistics
for 1995 that were not available in published sources were computed
by the author using the NNHS public-use file for nursing home
residents age sixty-five and older at the time of the survey. Compari-
sons for 1985 are from published NNHS statistics.2
Population. A comparison of the 1985 and 1995 NNHS resident
samples suggests some unexpected shifts in the way elders are using
the nursing home. First, the proportion of persons age sixty-five and
older staying overnight in a nursing facility on the survey date fell
since 1985 from 46.2 to 42.4 per thousand elderly, an 8.2 percent
decline in only ten years.3 If 1985 rates of use by age and sex were
applied to the 1995 elderly population, almost a quarter of a million
more elders would have been in nursing facilities on the survey date.
This decline was most striking (more than twenty per thousand) for
the oldest old (Exhibit 1). This portion of the elderly population, the
most rapidly growing segment, still makes up more than half of the
total elderly nursing home population (Exhibit 2).

For the first time 1995 NNHS statistics show that African Ameri-
can elderly have a higher rate of nursing home use than whites do,
reversing past disparities (Exhibit 3). The rates of use per thousand
elderly have grown since 1985 for all three age subcategories of
African Americans, while those for whites have fallen. The number
of oldest old African Americans has been growing more rapidly than

the number of similar-aged whites. If these trends continue, the
racial composition of the nursing home resident population will
approach that of the general elderly population.
Payers. Medicare was listed as the payer for 13 percent of resi-
dents in 1995, up from 2 percent in 1985. The proportion reporting
Medicaid as their primary payer also grew, from 49 percent to 56
percent. At the same time, the proportion of patients who pay for
their care with private funds declined from 44 percent (576,000
persons) in 1985 to 28 percent (about 405,000 persons) in 1995
(Exhibit 4).4
Length-of-stay. Although the NNHS is a survey of current resi-
dents and cannot provide information on completed stays, the data
suggest that average length-of-stay has fallen: The median time that
surveyed patients had been in the nursing home decreased from 611
days in 1985 to 553 days in 1995. Further, a higher proportion of 1995
residents had been in the nursing home less than six months.
Where Are The Missing Elders?
Five emerging trends might be responsible for the observed de-
cline in nursing home use.

Is the prevalence of disability declining? If the prevalence of
disability among the elderly were falling, we would expect fewer
elders to seek nursing home care. The National Long-Term Care
Survey (NLTCS), which includes both community-resident and in-
stitutionalized elders in its sample frame, indeed found that disabil-
ity declined substantially between 1984 and 1994. By 1994 the pro-
portion of elders experiencing at least one difficulty in performing
an instrumental or physical activity of daily living (ADL) had fallen
to 21.3 percent. Almost half of the 3.6-percentage-point decline in
the age-standardized rate of disability occurred between 1989 and
1994.5 However, this promising trend cannot account for the full
drop in rates of nursing home use.
Are nursing homes serving high-need patients at the expense
of lower-need elders? The role of the nursing facility (as identified
in the NNHS) is changing. Persons who were in a nursing home on
the survey date in 1995 were slightly more likely to have specific
disabilities than were their counterparts in 1985. Disability of nurs-
ing home residents can increase while disability rates in the popula-
tion fall (or remain constant) only if nursing homes are being more
selective and serving a more-disabled segment of the population.
Evidence of this changing role is suggested by NNHS staffing data:
Nursing facilities offered more hours of care per patient day in 1995
than they did in 1985. Nursing home residents' higher disability level
suggests that some less-disabled elders who would have been in a
nursing home in 1985 resided elsewhere in 1995. This underscores
the question: Are the missing elders with (lower levels of) disabili-
ties receiving services, and if so, where?
Has limited capacity kept elders out of nursing homes? In the
absence of sufficient nursing home beds, elders with disabilities
might have been stranded in community residences, unable to get
access to needed care. In fact, the supply of nursing facility care, as
identified by the NNHS sample frame, has not kept pace with the
growth of the elderly population. To accommodate the age-specific
rates of use observed in 1985 (at 1985 occupancy rates), it would
have been necessary to add 271,000 beds to the nation's supply of
nursing facility beds, an increase of 17 percent. Between 1985 and
1995 only 147,000 beds were added to the nursing home supply
encompassed by the NNHS sample frame--an increase of 9 per-
cent--and many of these were in hospital-based facilities.
Furthermore, in 1995 many more nursing home beds were filled
by a group of patients who were barely in evidence in 1985: those
receiving Medicare-financed postacute care. The absolute increase
in the number of Medicare patients observed in nursing facility beds
on the survey date was ninefold, from about 20,000 in 1985 to

178,000 in 1995.6 Many Medicare-funded patients using nursing
home care are not permanent nursing home residents; they will
return to the community after a relatively short postacute stay. If we
measure bed capacity excluding the beds taken up by Medicare
patients in both years, we find a decrease of 11,000 beds in nursing
facility bed supply available for non-Medicare residents, a reduction
of about 1 percent in total bed supply. In effect, all of the decade's
increase in nursing facility capacity was being devoted to the bur-
geoning Medicare skilled nursing facility (SNF) population.
However, the decline in effective capacity of nursing facilities did
not appear to be constraining use. In the aggregate, the occupancy
rate of nursing home beds has been falling, from 92 percent in 1985
to 87 percent in 1995. On the survey date in 1995 there were 222,000
empty nursing beds--90,000 more than in 1985. Some of these
empty beds are a natural adjunct to the increase in short-stay use:
Medicare-oriented nursing facilities have unpredictable admissions
and high turnover per bed and are almost guaranteed to have more
empty beds than do facilities of similar size serving long-stay pa-
tients and admitting new residents from community waiting lists.
But, taken at face value, the empty beds observed on the survey date
would have been sufficient to serve a great many of the "missing
elders." Lack of capacity was not forcing elders to remain in other
settings.
Can more care at home account for lower use rates? By 1995
more elders with disabilities were receiving health and personal care
at home than ever before, and this shift might account for the decline
in nursing home use rates. Medicare home health use grew phe-
nomenally after a clarification of eligibility criteria in 1989.7 In 1995,
9.6 percent of all aged Medicare beneficiaries used Medicare home
health care, up from 5.3 percent in 1985.8 Over that period the
number of visits per user shot up, from twenty-five to eighty. Elders
with disabilities as well as medical needs can receive Medicare-paid
supportive care from home health aides once they qualify. The clari-
fied regulations made it possible for some beneficiaries to receive
very long and even indefinite home health episodes. Medicare bene-
ficiaries receiving more than 150 visits formed a small proportion of
home health users, but they numbered approximately 400,000 in
1994--outnumbering our "missing elders."9 Less in the national
spotlight, Medicaid-funded home-delivered services increased at
rates comparable to Medicare home health services over the same
period, as Medicaid waiver programs were developed to counteract
Medicaid's bias toward institutional care. At least some of these
long-stay home health patients might have entered a nursing facility
if public sources had not supported their care.

As we consider the possibility that formal, paid home care may
have filled 1995 care gaps for some persons who would have been
nursing facility residents in 1985, it is important to remember the
crisis that has not happened: Despite unfavorable demographic
trends, informal, unpaid support continues to sustain care for older
persons living at home.10 In fact, recent tabulations of the 1994
NLTCS found that family and friends provided more hours of care to
older persons with disabilities than was the case in previous years.11
Are more elders living in settings that are neither homes nor
nursing homes? Some elders with disabilities who would have re-
sided in nursing homes in 1985 may have sought other care settings
in 1995, but lack of data makes this very difficult to assess.12 The U.S.
census classifies persons as residing either in households or in group
quarters, which include both institutions (most notably nursing
facilities) and other noninstitutional group quarters, such as room-
ing or boarding houses, group foster care, or board-and-care homes.13
Alternatives to nursing home care are found in all of these residen-
tial arrangements but are enumerated only infrequently, in the de-
cennial census. The census classifies both small board-and-care ar-
rangements and apartments in assisted-living facilities as
households, not institutions.14 Long-term institutions for persons
with psychiatric and developmental disabilities are shrinking even
as their populations are living longer. The growing population of
aging veterans has special access to some types of long-stay institu-
tions and group quarters and may prefer them to conventional nurs-
ing homes. Because the census does not ask about disability of resi-
dents or amount of care provided in any of these settings, it is not
possible to say whether the "missing elders" have found quasi-insti-
tutional arrangements that are meeting their needs.15
However, a living arrangement that falls within the census's
"household" category may be growing most rapidly beyond the pur-
view of institutional surveys such as the NNHS. Assisted living,
independent housing that provides access to disability care, has
been hailed as a "new paradigm" for elders with disabilities.16 Be-
cause the market for such housing is aimed at elders who can pay for
their care, growth in this market segment may explain the NNHS
finding noted above: the decline in the absolute number of elders
paying privately for nursing home care between the 1985 and 1995
survey dates. It is difficult to estimate how many older persons are
"Despite unfavorable demographic trends, informal, unpaid
support continues to sustain care for older persons living at home."

living in these arrangements. Apartment-style housing designed for
the elderly, even when accompanied by group dining and access to
personal care, is included in the housing stock by census definition.
Thus, residents of assisted-living facilities, independent living units
in continuing-care retirement communities, and supportive elderly
housing are considered members of households and are not counted
as living in group quarters. In the absence of clear definitions of new
residential arrangements, only surveys that ask about disability and
care provision can capture trends in these special residences.17
Implications For Policy
By 1995 developments in the Medicare postacute care benefit and
trends in the private long-term care market were perhaps beginning
to accomplish what long-standing Medicaid cost containment ef-
forts had not: They were reducing the preeminence of the nursing
home in the long-term care continuum. However, the policy devel-
opments and secular trends responsible for a changing nursing
home role are not necessarily permanent. New developments may
reinforce or reverse the positive trend observed for 1995.
Most notably, policies set in motion by the Balanced Budget Act
(BBA) of 1997 are unsettling the nursing home industry and other
long-term and postacute care providers. The BBA's Interim Payment
System (IPS) for Medicare home health services is reducing access
to home-delivered care, especially for beneficiaries with very long
stays. At the same time, changes in Medicare and Medicaid nursing
facility payment policy enacted in the BBA are likely to reduce the
flow of public resources to nursing homes, just as demand from
private patients also is declining. State initiatives that combine
Medicare and Medicaid funding streams for dual eligibles are likely
to lead to still different patterns of use for nursing home and home-
delivered services. Also, more elders are using their own resources to
express their preferences for noninstitutional care: Assisted living is
growing, and more people are buying private long-term care insur-
ance that covers care at home as well as in institutions. These devel-
opments are likely to lead to further "downsizing" of the nursing
home sector relative to the elderly population. As private and Medi-
care patients leave the nursing home market, Medicaid programs
may have to pay more to preserve adequate access for persons in the
greatest need of institutional long-term care.
As emerging BBA effects suggest, public policies and market
trends can have unforeseen effects on long-term care utilization
patterns. These changes, especially those that increase unmet need,
can occur "off the radar screen" of established surveys. Data collec-
tion comparable to the NNHS for noninstitutional residences that

serve elders would enable surveillance of the assisted-living sector
and similar future innovations. Comparable data for home health
providers could track some providers' responses to BBA policy
changes. In the end, however, we need population-based surveys
with sound identification of care environments. Statistics centered
on persons with disabilities and their care, rather than on particular
traditional sites of care, can track how well disability needs are
being met--for example, for Medicare home health recipients
served by agencies unable to survive under the IPS, or for beneficiar-
ies likely to have had very long or intensive home health stays prior
to BBA payment changes. Public and private initiatives in the fi-
nancing of long-term care then would have a better opportunity to
fill gaps and continue the positive developments of the past decade.

spurred by higher payment rates and by state policies encouraging "Medicare
maximization," and hospitals added or acquired SNF units. Most importantly,
beginning in 1988 clarification of eligibility rules for SNF care opened Medi-
care payment to patients with a wider range of postacute needs, for longer
stays. See Medicare and the American Health Care System: Report to the Congress

12. The increasing use of other residential care settings in itself undercuts the
validity of the NNHS as an information source. The decline in use observed in
the 1995 NNHS may be an illusion generated by shifting definitions of the
nursing home. In comparison with the 1985 survey, the 1995 NNHS sample
frame, based as always on state facility lists, encompassed fewer facilities that
provided low levels of care. Brenda Spillman, Center for Cost and Financing
Studies, Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, personal communica-
tion, May 1998. Because of the way the survey was conducted, we may be
observing fewer Americans in institutions that states call nursing homes, while
lower-level institutions previously included in the nursing home sector are
being given new names and appearing in new places.
13. The sample frame of a more frequent survey, the Current Population Survey
(CPS), includes only persons in households. Although residents of assisted-
living apartments are included, they are not identified as such. The CPS does
not include persons living in institutions and other group quarters, both pos-
sible residences for elders in need of long-term care.
