Business Leaders' Views On American Health Care
by Joel C. Cantor, Nancy L. Barrand, Randolph A. Desonia,
Alan B. Cohen, and Jeffrey C. Merrill
The reliance on employer-sponsored insurance to finance health care
places American business at the center of the debate over how to reform
the U.S. health care system. At issue is the level of responsibility that the
private sector should assume for the health care needs of workers and
their families, and the costs associated with providing such benefits.
Unlike in most other industrialized countries, employer-sponsored health
insurance in the United States has served as the main alternative to the
development of national health insurance for the entire population.
Several forces, such as continuing health care cost inflation, an increas-
ingly constrained and complex system of provider reimbursement, the
impending burden of retiree coverage, and concerns about how rising
health benefits costs may undermine international competitiveness, are
leading American business to take a closer look at what changes should
be made in health care financing and delivery.
Employer-sponsored insurance is the principal mechanism for financ-
ing health care in this country. Ninety-two percent of full-time employees
in medium-sized and large firms and 66 percent of all Americans rely on
employer-sponsored insurance as their primary source ofhealth coverage.1
Employers spent $176.8 billion in 1989 to provide health care benefits
to active and retired employees and their dependents, accounting for 29.3
percent of national health spending.2
As a benefit of employment, health care has become one of the most
contentious issues in recent labor negotiations.3 Workers are concerned
with maintaining or expanding their coverage, while employers seek
relief from the relentless cost inflation that has made health benefits the
fastest-rising component of employee compensation.4 Nowhere has this
tension been more apparent than in the recent debate over employers'
obligations to fund retiree health benefits, the future costs of which are

estimated to exceed some companies' total assets.5 Despite numerous cost
containment efforts on the part of employers, in 1989 alone, premium
increases averaged 20 percent.6 Spending by employers for health benefits
has exceeded 50 percent of pretax corporate profits since 1982.7
While there may not yet be consensus on how best to address these
problems, business could be a determining factor in creating the political
will to proceed. To date, several surveys have been conducted to gauge
the position of business on health care issues.8 None, however, has
succeeded in reaching a large, representative sample of major corporate
executives. Yet it is precisely those business executives who are most likely
to be influential in the debate over health care reform. In this DataWatch,
we report findings from a survey of the chief executives of the nation's
largest corporations. The confidential survey, conducted in late 1990 by
the Gallup Organization on behalf of The Robert Wood Johnson Foun-
dation, aimed to elicit business executives' views on the need for change
in the health care system, the directions that such changes should take,
and the role that business should play in the health care system.
Survey methods. Chief executives of the 1,000 firms on the Fortune
500 service and industrial lists were invited to participate in a fifteen-
minute telephone interview between 5 July and 17 December 1990.9 In
advance of telephone contact, a letter of invitation was sent, accompa-
nied by the endorsement of four prominent corporate executives. Indi-
viduals with the title of chief executive officer (CEO) were approached
for a confidential interview, and, if CEOs were unavailable (some com-
panies do not use the CEO title), only individuals with the titles of
president or chairman of the board were accepted. After extensive efforts
to obtain responses during the twenty-three-week field period, an abbre-
viated questionnaire was mailed to the CEOs of companies that did not
respond to the telephone survey. A total of 330 telephone interviews and
54 mail questionnaires were completed, yielding a response rate of 38.7
percent. This represents the largest number of interviews of CEOs,
presidents, or chairmen of the board from Fortune 500 companies ever
completed on health care issues. Furthermore, respondents are highly
representative of those on the Fortune 500 service and industrial lists.10
The Need For Change In The Health Care System
Respondents were asked which of three statements best reflected their
overall view of the U.S. health care system: (1) "only minor changes are
needed;" (2) "fundamental changes are needed;" or (3) "we need to
completely rebuild it."11 Ninety-one percent of the top executives sur-
veyed expressed the view that fundamental changes or complete rebuild-

ing of the system is needed (Exhibit 1). The motivation for change may
be found in the executives' assessments of problems in the health care
system. System costs were cited most frequently, although concerns about
access to care also figured prominently. Sixty-two percent of respondents
mentioned cost concerns first when asked in an open-ended question to
identify the most important problems in the health care system; 24
percent also mentioned concerns about access.
This motivation for change may also be spurred by the executives'
concerns about the effects of health care costs on their own companies.
Thirty-five percent rated health care costs as a "top concern" compared
to other costs of doing business for their company. Nearly 60 percent rated
health care costs as a "major concern," and only 7 percent as "minor" or
not a concern at all. The proportion of respondents ranking health care
costs as a "top concern" did not vary significantly by number of employees
in the company. However, those executives reporting more than 10
percent of their company's payroll going for health benefits (134 respon-
dents) were twice as likely to rate the cost of those benefits as a "top
concern" than were those whose companies spent less than 5 percent.
Most executives expressed pessimism about their companies' prospects
for controlling health care costs. Only 12.7 percent predicted that their
company would be able to bring costs "mostly under control" over the
next year or two. When asked whether the solution to the problem of
rising health care costs could be achieved by each employer working on
its own, three-fourths said no. Furthermore, over half agreed that health
care costs cannot be controlled without some form of government inter-
vention. This is noteworthy given that, over the past ten years, many
large employers have elected to self-insure and to negotiate directly with
providers in an attempt to insulate themselves from cost shifting and
regulatory controls in the insurance market. More than 80 percent of the
firms surveyed reported being wholly or partly self-insured.

The Direction For Change
Executives reporting the need for fundamental changes or complete
rebuilding of the health care system were nearly twice as likely as those
advocating only minor changes to believe that government intervention
is needed to control costs. Those who saw the need to completely rebuild
were also three times more likely to have expressed interest in alternatives
to the current employer-based insurance system. One-fourth of all respon-
dents agreed that the current employer-based system should be replaced,
and among those who would completely rebuild the system, more than
two-thirds would replace it entirely.
Specific government actions. To discern in greater detail the direction
in which respondents felt that public policy should go, we asked them
about ten specific government actions (Exhibit 2). For each action, they
were asked whether government should "act now," "consider for the
future," or "not consider within the foreseeable future." For four of the
interventions, three-quarters or more of the executives supported imme-

diate government action or consideration for the future. Three other
government interventions received majority support ("act now" or "con-
sider..."), while three interventions did not receive majority support.
Perhaps because of the traditional free-market orientation of business,
many of the government interventions involving direct regulation of the
health care industry received relatively little support. However, when we
examined executives' perceptions of necessary measures to control costs,
some preferences for various government regulations emerged. Among
executives who support government intervention to control costs, most
indicated that government should implement or consider the following
reforms: medical standards, a single set of reimbursement rules for all
payers, and regulation of payment to hospitals and doctors. Less supported
by all respondents were government controls over physical capacity of
the health care system and numbers of medical and surgical specialists.
Those actions most commonly proposed to increase access to health
care--tax incentives for small businesses, expansion of public programs,
mandated employer-based coverage, and universal public health insur-
ance--received mixed support. For example, more than three-quarters of
the executives supported expansion of existing public programs. At least
two out of three respondents would give high priority to people that
experience catastrophic medical expenses, are denied coverage because
of poor health, or cannot afford available coverage. In contrast, only half
of the respondents would give high priority for government help to the
unemployed, and fewer than one-third would place high priority on help
for employees of businesses that do not provide coverage.
Support for systemwide reform was also strongly associated with per-
ceptions about cost control. Executives who believe that government
intervention is needed to control costs were more likely to support
options involving major restructuring of the health care system. The more
fundamental the restructuring, the greater was this differential in support.
The differential was greatest for universal public health insurance, which
received support from only 9 percent of executives who reported that
companies can control costs on their own, compared to half of executives
who reported that government help is needed. Among the ninety-three
executives who supported the most fundamental change--replacing the
employer-based insurance system--more than 80 percent supported a
single reimbursement system for all payers, and an equal proportion
supported universal public health insurance.
The role of business. Various scenarios for changing the U.S. health
care system promote different roles for the public and private sectors.
Regardless of the extent or type of government action endorsed, respon-
dents supported some level of continued private-sector responsibility for

health care coverage of their workers (Exhibit 3). A large majority would
continue company responsibility for basic hospital care, A smaller major-
ity saw companies as responsible for substance abuse and mental health
benefits. On the other hand, a majority endorsed government or shared
responsibility for catastrophic and long-term care. Even many of the
executives supporting systemwide reform believed companies should
retain some responsibility for their employees' health care costs. For
example, among executives responding that government should "act
now" to implement universal public health insurance, 45.8 percent would
still have companies take responsibility for basic hospital coverage.
Also, regardless of the direction change might take, executives
endorsed greater individual cost sharing and continued experimentation
with ways to organize efficient medical care delivery. Nearly three-fourths
reported that the out-of-pocket expense paid by individuals for their
health care is too little. In addition, approximately half felt that replacing
fee-for-service medical practice with managed care delivery entities that
take responsibility for their enrollees would lead to better cost control.
Implications For The National Debate
This survey of 384 top executives of the nation's largest companies--
employing ten million individuals--reveals a nascent political will
among business leaders to proceed with major changes in the health care
system. Pressure from rising costs of providing health care coverage to
their workers may be the single most important factor stimulating execu-
tives' current high level of interest in system reform. The extent of change

endorsed by executives reflects their views of what will be needed to bring
system costs under control. Thus, the 203 executives who supported
government intervention to control costs are the strongest proponents
not only of regulatory solutions, but also of fundamental system reforms
as dramatic as replacement of the current system of employer-based
insurance. The unrelenting inflation in health care costs is likely to
further induce business leaders to support major reforms. This trend is
already evident in the comparison of 1985 and 1990 surveys of business
executives conducted by William M. Mercer, Inc. The proportion of
respondents in those surveys who strongly agreed that the United States
"is facing a health care crisis" rose from 30 to 54 percent over that period.12
The executives surveyed here were willing to consider a wide range of
specific government actions to change the health care system. They also
advocated continuing some company responsibility for workers' basic
health care coverage. This may indicate their wish to redefine the role of
business within the context of a more complementary public/private
system of health care coverage. The comparatively stronger support for
an all-payer reimbursement system than for direct regulation of the health
care industry or for a public-only insurance system may further underscore
that a more acceptable and viable solution is a partnership of business
and government rather than one imposed by the public sector.
The national debate over the future of the health care system, thus far,
has proceeded without consensus. Large businesses, as major stakeholders
in the outcome of this debate, will play a key role in determining the
direction that change will take. Half of the business leaders are undertak-
ing executive-level efforts to determine where their company stands on
national health policy issues. The findings of this survey illustrate both a
sense of urgency and a willingness among major employers to pursue
fundamental reform of our nation's health care system. As costs continue
to escalate, the pressure for change will grow.
