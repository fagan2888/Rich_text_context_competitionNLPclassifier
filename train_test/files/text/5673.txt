Introduction
Prescription opioid drug abuse has received unprecedented
clinical, research, and public policy attention in the past
decade, as it is the fastest growing drug problem in the
United States and a significant problem worldwide (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2012a). In the
United States, over 5000 new individuals begin misusing
prescription opioids and more than 100 die from opioid-
related overdose every day (Bohnert et al., 2011).
Furthermore, drug overdose is now the leading cause of
injury deaths among US adults, with those resulting from
opioid overdose exceeding the death rates from all other
illicit drugs combined (Chen et al., 2014). The CDC has
declared opioid abuse and diversion a public health crisis of
epidemic proportions (CDC, 2011). There are many estab-
lished definitions used to describe problematic opioid (and
other substance) use including abuse, dependence, addic-
tion, disorder, misuse, and non-medical or extra-medical
use. The authors refer to the National Institute on Drug
Abuse (NIDA) definition when discussing opioid abuse in
this article. NIDA defines prescription opioid drug abuse as
any "non-medical use" or use different than the exact regi-
men in which it was prescribed (e.g. in higher doses or
increased frequency, using opioid medications that were
not prescribed to you) or for reasons other than why it was
prescribed (e.g. to get high, to self-medicate psychiatric
symptoms) (Alford and Livingston, 2013).
Individuals with chronic pain compose a large popula-
tion at considerable risk of abusing prescription opioids
given the likelihood that they would be prescribed this class
of medication for pain management. More than 80
percent
of all physician consults in the United States are pain related,
and nearly one-third of all Americans suffer from chronic
pain (Bresler, 1979; Institute of Medicine (IOM), 2011;
Salovey, 1992). Data from the CDC suggest that
approximately 40percent of the over 100million individuals

Abstract
Prescription opioid drug abuse has reached epidemic proportions. Individuals with chronic pain represent a large
population at considerable risk of abusing opioids. The Opioid Abuse Risk Screener was developed as a comprehensive
self-administered measure of potential risk that includes a wide range of critical elements noted in the literature to be
relevant to opioid risk. The creation, refinement, and preliminary modeling of the item pool, establishment of preliminary
concurrent validity, and the determination of the factor structure are presented. The initial development and validation
of the Opioid Abuse Risk Screener shows promise for effective risk stratification.

in the United States with chronic pain will actively seek
medical help for pain symptoms, and although prevalence
rates may vary across population and clinic settings, as
many as 20percent of these people will become addicted to
opioid analgesics during treatment (CDC, 2012a). Each
year, insurers pay more than 72.5
billion dollars to cover
direct healthcare costs necessitated by the abuse of prescrip-
tion opioids (CDC, 2012b; White et al., 2005). Adding to
this the estimated 53
billion in economic costs, the total
annual societal burden is conservatively at US$125
billion
(CDC, 2012b). These figures do not take into account the
many individual, interpersonal, and relational costs often
associated with prescription opioid abuse.
In an effort to mitigate the opioid crisis, the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) now mandates compliance to
the strict standards of their risk evaluation and mitigation
strategy (REMS) for opioid analgesics, which requires
comprehensive screening and documentation of assessment
(U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 2012). The
American Pain Society (APS) and American Academy of
Pain Medicine (AAPM) have developed evidence-based
practice guidelines for opioid therapy (Chou et al., 2009a,
2009b, 2009c). The first major recommendation of the
APS/AAPM guidelines is for careful patient selection and
risk stratification (Chou et al., 2009b). These guidelines, as
well as those developed by the US Department of Veterans
Affairs/Department of Defense (Department of Veterans
Affairs and Department of Defense (VA/DoD), 2010) and
by other countries, highlight the need for comprehensive
screening and suggest that proper patient selection can min-
imize potential risks and increase potential benefits of opi-
oid analgesics in the treatment of chronic pain (Graziotti
and Goucke, 1997; Jovey et al., 2003; Kalso et al., 2003;
Society, 2010; VA/DoD, 2010).
Appropriate and effective screening and risk stratifica-
tion as part of a comprehensive evaluation can help to
lower the rates of opioid abuse, overdose, and death by
providing useful risk information. This can further aid in
reduced incidence of inaccurate or missed diagnoses, pro-
vide evidence to support appropriate monitoring, and
reduce rates of doctor shopping and diversion.
Comprehensive screening and risk stratification are asso-
ciated with decreased costs for patients, providers, and
insurers as those prescribing are able to make increasingly
well-informed decisions when treatment-planning regard-
ing what to prescribe and how to best monitor patients for
safety based on individual risk profiles.
Despite FDA requirements, practice guidelines, and
staggering prevalence rates of abuse and overdose, many
practitioners are not formally screening for risk, either at
the time of initial evaluation and prescribing nor at follow-
up visits or are screening patients solely depending on
their "gut" or instinct about risk level (Michna et al., 2007;
Wasan et al., 2005). In addition, it is suggested that many
physicians prescribing opioid pain medications have very
little training in aberrant drug-related behavior and sub-
stance abuse; thus, they may have limitations in their abil-
ity to effectively and accurately assess risk (Chou et al.,
2009a, 2009b, 2009c; Graziotti and Goucke, 1997; Jovey
et al., 2003; Kalso et al., 2003; Sehgal et al., 2012; Wasan
et al., 2005). Research suggests even the best trained pre-
scribers are not always successful in accurately screening
for risk (Wasan et al., 2005) and all too often patients are
being prescribed opioids without their prescriber having a
clear and well-informed idea of their level of risk of abuse
(Sehgal et al., 2012). For example, Wasan et al. (2007)
found that prescribers estimated only 13.9percent of their
patients demonstrate aberrant behaviors (ABs), yet 50per-
cent of those prescribed opioids had positive urine toxicol-
ogy screens for illicit drugs and 8.7percent had no opioids
in their urine at all. There is a clear need for improved
screening that provides comprehensive and accurate evi-
dence of opioid risk stratification, especially as many
insurance companies are recommending that risk assess-
ments be given to provide evidence for a coverage deter-
mination of medical necessity for urine drug screening
(Owen et al., 2012).
There are several validated measures designed to assess
risk of misusing opioids including the Opioid Risk Tool
(ORT; Webster and Webster, 2005), Attitudes and
Behaviors Questionnaire (Passik et al., 2000), and the
Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain­
Revised (SOAPP-R; Butler et al., 2008, 2009). These
measures provide useful information and insights into
potential risk of abuse, yet are relatively limited in scope
regarding biopsychosocial risk including psychiatric vari-
ables and history of AB. Furthermore, there is concern that
some measures may overestimate risk (Moore et al., 2009)
and although it is likely better to over-estimate rather than
under-estimate risk in these circumstances, this potential
overestimation translates directly to the pain management
options an individual may be given and may limit opioid
medications that provide effective reductions in pain. Of
important note, the authors do not believe that any assess-
ment measure should, in and of itself, be used to determine
pain management options or to deny opioid medications.
Rather risk assessments should be used in tandem with a
clinical assessment, review of medical records, and other
available collateral information to develop a well-informed
and comprehensive patient profile.
Strong evidence connects a variety of psychiatric and
biopsychosocial variables to increase the risk of opioid
abuse in individuals with chronic pain (Alford and
Livingston, 2013; Ballantyne and Mao, 2003; Edlund et al.,
2007; Richardson et al., 2012; Seal et al., 2012; Sehgal
et al., 2012; Sullivan et al., 2006); yet, to date, no assess-
ments have been developed to adequately evaluate these
often co-occurring and sometimes mutually exacerbating
factors. In order to address the limitations with current risk
screeners, the Opioid Abuse Risk Screener (OARS) was
Henrie-Barrus et al. 3
developed as a comprehensive self-administered measure
of opioid abuse that includes a wide range of critical ele-
ments noted in the literature to be relevant to opioid risk
(e.g. depressive and anxiety symptoms, exposure to trauma/
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, history of
abuse/neglect, history of substance abuse, tobacco use, and
impulsivity). As noted above, the OARS is not intended to
assess and stratify risk of developing substance use disor-
der based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders­Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria specifically, but
rather to assess risk of opioid abuse more broadly including
self-medication of psychiatric symptoms, diversion and
other AB, and recreational use. These behaviors can, of
course, lead to the development of a substance use disorder,
as defined by the DSM-5, if left untreated.
The OARS is a brief, yet comprehensive screening
measure grounded in the evidence regarding risk factors for
opioid abuse that meets and surpasses clinical practice
guidelines for effective risk stratification. This article
describes the creation of the OARS in three steps: (1) the
creation, refinement, and preliminary modeling of the item
pool to an anonymous sample; (2) testing the refined items
in a new sample, establishing preliminary concurrent valid-
ity by comparing the measure to a validated opioid risk
measure; and (3) testing a revised item set and determining
the factor structure in a larger, clinical sample. Each step is
presented followed by a brief discussion of areas for future
development and research. All studies presented in this arti-
cle were conducted with the approval of the University of
Utah Institutional Review Board.
Methods
Study 1: item development
Expert consensus group.A group of clinical professionals
experienced in working with pain patients consulted with
the authors throughout item development and the other
stages of study described in this article. The group com-
prised eight psychologists, five physicians, two master-
level mental health counselors, and two advance practice
registered nurse (APRN) practitioners.
Construct and item development. The authors first performed
a review of the pain and substance abuse literature, and
existing risk assessment measures, including the SOAPP-R
(Butler et al., 2008, 2009) and ORT (Webster and Webster,
2005). This review identified several prospective content
domains likely to increase the risk of opioid abuse (i.e. sub-
stance use history, depression, and anxiety). These con-
structs were presented to the consensus group, which was
asked to provide feedback on the clinical relevance of each
domain, and to identify any spurious or missing constructs.
The resulting domains are noted in Table 1.
An initial item pool was generated consisting of 230
items, positively oriented to one of the six accepted content
domains. Many redundant items were included to identify
the strongest items for each domain (i.e. "I have abused
drugs or alcohol" and "My drug or alcohol use has caused
me problems in the past"). The consensus group, who
accepted, rejected, or requested revisions to item content,
then iteratively refined the items, leaving a pool of 162
items deemed "content valid." The group was also asked to
theoretically load each item onto the factor they perceived
was best being measured by the item. In all, 26 items that,
by group consensus, could not be theoretically loaded onto
a single factor or were thought to load on multiple factors
were omitted. Additionally, five volunteer patients with
chronic, non-cancer pain (aged 28­51
years; three males
and two females) were asked to identify items that were
unclear, confusing, or difficult to endorse. These 31 items
were removed, leaving 105 prospective items total.
Reducing the item count. Data were gathered from 142 fully
anonymous volunteers at a pain clinic in Utah, and statisti-
cal analyses were performed to reduce spurious and con-
founding items, and to add some additional evidence
supporting the content validity established by the consen-
sus group. First, items were purged based on reliability and
corrected item-total correlation analyses. A confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA) was then conducted separately for
each of the content domains, using the "majority rules"
item-to-factor assignments obtained from the consensus
group. Since the items were rated on a 4-point Likert-type

scale, the default maximum likelihood (ML) estimator,
which assumes continuous data conforming to a multivari-
ate normal distribution, could not be used (Brown, 2015;
Edwards et al., 2012). Instead, categorical assumptions
using WLSMV adjusted estimation was applied as in
Muthen (2009). Items with unacceptably high modification
indices (MIs) or low loadings were removed and the CFA
was repeated. The results of the six, single factor, CFAs are
presented alongside the representative content domains
established by the consensus group in Table 1.
The results of these analyses were provided to the same
panel of experts who recommended several revisions (e.g.
word choice, number of items) and supported the notion
that the remaining items were still content valid to the
defined constructs. Minor wording revisions were made to
6 items and 38 were omitted before continuing data collec-
tion. Data for 61 items were then gathered from 289 fully
anonymous volunteers at a multi-site pain clinic in Utah.
Poorly functioning items were removed following classical
item analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA), from
which evidence of either one or two factors was obtained.
CFA was then conducted to test both the one-factor (1A)
and the two-factor model (1B); the results of these analyses
are presented in Table 2. Neither model yielded robust fit
statistics; however, with CFI
=
.927 (trending close to .95,
the gold standard), the two-factor model (with emotional
and psychological items loading on one factor, and behav-
ioral items loading on the other) emerged as the stronger of
the two. After removing items with high poor factor load-
ings or large correlated errors, 38 items were retained.
Study 2: preliminary modeling and validity
Participants.Data were gathered from a sample of 267
adults who presented for consultation at one of several
outpatient, community-based pain clinics in Utah, Idaho,
and Nevada that included the OARS items in standard
preliminary screening paperwork. In all, 249 patients
with no missing data were included in analysis, while 18
incomplete records were omitted. The completing and
non-completing populations appear similar: 55 versus
50
percent were females, 53 versus 55
percent were
unemployed, 63 versus 61percent were married or part-
nered, 85 versus 95
percent were White, and 50 versus
44
percent reported currently taking opioid analgesics
for pain.
Methods. As in Study 1, EFAand CFAwere each conducted
on the full sample, and WLSMV rather than ML estimation
was applied. EFA again showed strong support for one or
two factors and identified six items that did not load
strongly on any factor or that loaded very strongly on mul-
tiple factors. The consensus group reviewed these items
and determined that they were either redundant or not criti-
cal. A CFA was performed on 32 items, testing multiple
alternate models of factor structure: a two-factor conge-
neric model (2A) in which the items were specified to load
on two separate first-order factors; a one-factor model (2B);
and a hierarchical model in which each of the two first-
order factors in 2A were specified to load on an underlying
second-order factor (2C).
Preliminary evaluation of convergent and discriminant
validity was performed on model 2A, which demonstrated
the best fit, using the recommendations of Fornell and
Larcker (1981) and Hair et al. (2006). Convergence is indi-
cated by the degree to which the average of the squared
loadings (R2) exceeds .50 for a given factor. Discriminant
validity is evidenced when the average R2 for each factor
exceeds the squared correlation between factors. A prelimi-
nary test of concurrent validity was performed by comparing
the degree to which raw scores obtained from each of the
factors in model 2A were correlated with each other and
with raw scores from the SOAPP-R. Although the authors
feel the SOAPP-R is limited in biopsychosocial comprehen-
sive assessment, this measure was selected as the comparator
given its wide spread use as a measure of risk of opioid
abuse and related ABs, and the scientific evidence support-
ing its validity and reliability.

Results
Model 2A: two first-order factors.Model 2A postulates
that 16 of the 32 retained items load separately on each of
two first-order factors, as identified in the EFA. Based on
item content, the authors and the consensus group labeled
the factors "emotional lability" (EL) and "AB." Table 3
compares the standardized factor loadings and R2 values for
each item in models 2A and 2B. All items had acceptable
factor loadings, and 28 items had strong loadings (>7.0).
The average R2 values were .579 and .569 for the EL and
AB factors, respectively. The overall fit of this model (and
others) is summarized in Table 2. Acceptable fit is indicated
by a CFI of .908 and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) of .958
although RMSEA appears to be undesirably high (.128)
based on the range of .05­.08 suggested by Browne et al.
(1993). All parameter estimates were significant, and MI
>10.0 were limited to four potential cross-loadings between
10.1 and 17.4 and three minor correlated error terms rang-
ing from 12.91 to 24.11.
A relatively high association between factors was
observed. The correlation between the two factors in 2A
was estimated to be .765. Squaring the correlation indicates
that 58percent of the variance in one of these two factors
is explained by variability in the other factor. Finally,
Cronbach's alpha () was found to be .932 for factor EL
and .895 for factor AB. Together, the 32 items demonstrate
acceptable internal reliability and validity (=.88; sensitiv-
ity=.81; specificity=.68).
Model 2B: one first-order factor. Comparing the item-by-item
loadings in Table 3 reveals that each item has a lower loading
on model 2B than 2A, smaller R2 values, higher chi-square (a
measure of misfit), lower CFI and TLI, and higher RMSEA.
The one-factor model does not fit the data better than 2A.

Model 2C: a hierarchical model. Given the degree of corre-
lation between factors in 2A, it was reasonable to determine
whether a hierarchical model specifying a single second-
order factor would account for the estimated correlation
between two first-order factors. However, 2C was unidenti-
fied unless the loadings of each of the two first-order fac-
tors were constrained to be equal. Under this constraint,
the fit statistics were identical to those of model 2A--see
discussions by Brown (2006) and MacCallum et al. (1993).
Model 2C will not be presented in further detail.
Preliminary evidence of concurrent validity. The correla-
tion between the raw scores of the model 2A EL and AB
scales was .615 while the correlation of the SOAPP-R to
EL and AB was .635 and .591, respectively. Squaring val-
ues and interpreting the resultant coefficients of determi-
nation indicate that 40.3percent of the variance in the EL
factor and 34.9percent of the AB factor are shared with or
explained by the variance in the SOAPP-R. It is important
to note that the factors of model 2A were not hypothesized
to correlate perfectly with the SOAPP-R as the OARS
assesses a broader range of psychiatric variables as well
as AB and impulsivity. Both measures are designed to
assess a person's risk of opioid abuse, but by evaluating
somewhat different constructs. For this reason, it is rea-
sonable to expect the variability that is shared between
the SOAPP-R and the EL or AB factor to be less than the
unshared variability. The percentages reported above pro-
vide nascent evidence that the OARS two-factor model
measures something similar to the SOAPP-R while also
exhibiting distinguishing characteristics that imply the
OARS is not identical to the SOAPP-R.
Study 3: factor structure replication
Following Study 2, the authors again consulted with the
consensus group to discuss results and review items for
content validity after the iterative reduction in item count.
The group recommended revisions to the traumatic stress
items due to concern about assessing general stress (i.e. in
Study 1: "I sometimes have upsetting dreams about events
from my past") rather than traumatic stress (i.e. revised in
Study 2: "I have nightmares about a past traumatic event").
Items were also added at the request of the consensus
group to address suicidal ideation (i.e. "I have been think-
ing about ending my life") and impulsivity (i.e. "I do
things without thinking about the consequences" and "I
do not plan activities carefully").
Participants.Data were gathered from a sample of 1821
adults who presented for consultation at one of the 14 out-
patient community-based pain clinics in various locations
throughout the United States. Patients were randomly
divided into two subsamples (S1, n=911; S2, n=910)
stratified by pain clinic. The authors received only
completed records and do not have information about the
population that may not have completed the assessment.
In this sample, 52.1
percent of subjects were female,
47.4
percent were male, and .5
percent identified as nei-
ther male nor female. Patients ranged from 18 to 87years
of age with a mean age of 46.48years. A total of 48.2per-
cent of the patients were unemployed, 40.4percent were
smokers, and 12.2
percent reported participating in sub-
stance abuse treatment in the past.
Methods.To avoid capitalizing on chance patterns in the
data, EFA was conducted on a different sample than the
CFA as encouraged by Floyd and Widaman (1995) and
Henson and Roberts (2006). An EFA, as described in Study
1 and Study 2, was conducted on sample S1.
A CFA was conducted on sample S2 to test several mod-
els that may explain the results of the EFA: model 3A com-
prised of five first-order factors, models 3B and 3C
representing the inter-correlations among the five first-order
factors using one and two second-order factors, respectively,
and model 3D, a bifactor model including a general factor
that directly influences each of the 28 items as well as
domain-specific "group factors" that each account for addi-
tional common variance shared by a cluster of similar items.
Because models 3A, 3B, and 3C are nested within the
bifactor model (3D), the adjusted chi-square difference test
was used to formally test each of the three models one at a
time against the bifactor solution (Muthen, 2009). Finally, as
Cronbach's alpha is not appropriate for estimating the relia-
bility of scores based on a higher-order or bifactor model
(Brunner et al., 2012), two extensions of McDonald's (1985,
1999) () omega, omegahierarchical
(H
), and omegasubscale
(S
), were used (Reise, 2012; Reise et al., 2013; Zinbarg
et al., 2006). Correcting for the multidimensionality in the
general factor of a bifactor model, H
indicates the propor-
tion of the total variance due solely to the general factor
(Brunner et al., 2012; Gignac, 2015; Reise, 2012). One can
use S
to estimate the internal consistency reliability of each
specific factor in a bifactor model independently of all the
other factors or subscales (Gignac, 2015; Reise, 2012).
Finally, the explained common variance (ECV) ratio was
used to quantify the degree of unidimensionality in bifactor
data as per Reise (2012) (Figure 1).
Results.Contrary to previous results, the parallel analysis
and eigenvalues strongly supported five or six factors. How-
ever, the sixth factor comprises solely of redundant test items
added to this latest round of data collection, and these items
loaded nearly as strongly on one factor in the five-factor
model. The resulting factors were generally aligned with the
original target constructs (depression, anxiety, traumatic
stress, substance use history, and behavioral risk factors).
Models 3A: five first-order factors. Model 3A (comprises
five first-order factors) allowed the correlations between the
Henrie-Barrus et al. 7
five factors to be freely estimated, but it did not allow for any
correlated residuals. Good relative model-data fit (CFI=.959
and TLI
=
.954) and reasonably good absolute model-data
fit (RMSEA=.070 and weighted root mean square residual
WRMR
=1.830) were found (see Table 2 for summary).
The factors are all positively correlated with the correlations
ranging in magnitude from .523 to .846 (Table 4).
Models 3B and 3C: five first-order factors loading on one (3B)
or two (3C) second-order factors.The results summarized
Figure 1. Path diagrams for models 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D.
8 Health Psychology Open 
in Table 2 indicate reasonably good relative fit for model
3B (CFI=.958 and TLI=.954) and 3C (CFI=.950 and
TLI=.945). Similarly, reasonably good absolute model-data
fit was found for 3B (RMSEA=.071 and WRMR=1.894)
and 3C (RMSEA=.077 and WRMR=2.056).
Model 3D: bifactor model with a general factor and five
domain-specific factors.The value of H
is .897 indicating
that approximately 89
percent of the variance in the total
scores computed from the 28 items is due to the general
factor. The values of S
range from .128 to .462, but four of
the five specific factors have a value less than .230. These
findings indicate that the proportion of the variance con-
tributed by each of the specific factors themselves is rela-
tively small. The sum of the squared standardized loadings
on the general factor is 12.421, and the sum of the squared
standardized loadings on the five domain-specific factors is
17.151; the ECV ratio is 12.421/(12.421+5.213), or .704.
Estimated factor loadings obtained from the bifactor model
for the general factor and each of the domain-specific fac-
tors are reported in Table 5. All of the unstandardized factor
loadings were statistically significant.
Preliminary suggestions for scoring. Given that the bifactor
model fits the data better than the other tested models, and
the fact that the general factor tends to be dominant relative
to the specific factors, a single, composite score should be
reported for each examinee, comprised of the unit-weighted
sum of responses to all 28 items. If the response anchors are
coded 0­3, the range of possible scores will be 0­84. The
score obtained by an individual respondent can be inter-
preted as a measure of his or her risk of opioid abuse; the
higher the score, the greater the risk. However, it is impor-
tant to note that until further study compares these 28 items
to other measures (both behavioral, as in the SOAPP-R,
and biological, as in urine drug tests), this assumption will
not be confirmed. After controlling for the general factor,
the loadings on the specific factors are generally small.
Consequently, the omega values for the specific factors are
generally low as shown in Table 6. Therefore, the items do
not provide sufficient information to strongly support the
reporting of sub-scores for each specific factor. Future data
collection and analysis will refine scoring algorithms.
Discussion
Effective and predictive risk stratification screening is vital
for anyone being considered for opioid pain management
given the significant abuse liability and related negative
consequences, up to and including opioid-related overdose
and death. Although there are validated measures currently
available, which do provide useful information and demon-
strate predictive validity (e.g. Butler et al., 2009), they do
not deliver a comprehensive assessment of multiple biopsy-
chosocial risk factors of opioid abuse. The OARS was
developed in response to the need for careful and compre-
hensive assessment for opioid risk stratification and was
created based on constructs shown in the literature to be
most relevant to substance abuse broadly, and opioid abuse
specifically.
The models
An iterative process has arrived at a measure consisting of
28 items. Since the 28 items were intended to assess differ-
ent facets of a single over-arching construct (the constructs
related to risk of opioid abuse initially derived), these mod-
erate-to-high correlations in 3Aare not surprising. However,
the size of these between-factor correlations indicates the
possibility that a hierarchical model would account for
these relationships among the factors and better fit the data.
Next, we explored models that provided a different way
to explain the inter-correlations among the five first-order
factors, with one (3B) or two (3C) second-order factors.
The second-order factor is assumed to directly influence
two or more first-order factors, but have no influence on the
items specifically. It is assumed that the influence of the
second-order factors on the various items is mediated
through the first-order factors.
Initial development procedures of the OARS demon-
strate preliminary, yet promising internal validity of a
bifactor model (3D). As above, the value of H
was just
below 90
percent indicating that vast majority of variance
in the total scores computed from the 28 items is due to the
general factor. Reise (2012) indicates that "Generally
speaking, the higher the ECV, the `stronger' the general
factor relative to the group (i.e. specific) factors and thus,
the more confidence a researcher has in applying a unidi-
mensional measurement model to multidimensional data"
(p. 687).
Higher CFI/TLI and lower RMSEA/WRMR for the
bifactor relative to the other models support the inference
that the bifactor model is a better fit for the data than the
other three models. These results (presented in Table 7)
indicate that the bifactor solution produces a statistically
significant decrement in the chi-square measure of misfit
compared to each of the other three models. In other words,
each of the three rival models fits significantly worse than
the bifactor model.

Comparison of models in Study 2 and Study 3
There are notable similarities and differences in the models
described in Study 2 and Study 3. The selected model in
Study 2 specified emotional and behavioral items on two
separate first-order factors, and although a bifactor model
with five specific factors was identified in Study 3, the results
are not as divergent as it may seem. Model 3B was com-
prised of five first-order factors overlaying two second-order
factors (one emotional and the other behavioral). A potential

explanation of this is that the larger sample size and slightly
modified item content in Study 3 may have provided higher
"resolution" data, allowing each construct to be more easily
differentiated from the shared variance, causing a shift from
two first-order factors to five in both EFA and CFA. Yet
despite that increased granularity, the higher level function-
ing of these constructs has remained relatively stable
throughout all three studies presented above with EB andAB
continuing to emerge as strong conceptual frameworks upon
which to base an understanding of risk of opioid abuse.
10 Health Psychology Open 
Many of the factors that contribute to opioid risk overlap
with one another outside of the context of this specific instru-
ment (i.e. psychiatric conditions such as depression and
PTSD are highly comorbid with substance use disorders), so
inter-correlated factors and high cross-loadings are not sur-
prising. Construct-relevant multidimensionality (Morin
et al., 2015) may explain this result as well as the similarities
observed between models 2A and 3B. The risk factors for
opioid abuse do not occur in a vacuum and are not unitary
constructs, but are a collection of highly correlated, highly
comorbid, and often mutually exacerbating symptoms that
contribute to opioid risk (Morin et al., 2015).
Limitations
This work has some limitations that must be addressed.
Although the final sample size is large, the majority of
patients used for this validation study presented for care at
outpatient community pain clinics across Utah, Idaho, and
Nevada. It will be valuable to seek a more diverse sample
in terms of pain populations as well as geographical loca-
tion to improve generalizability of results. Additionally,
this study only evaluates an adult population. Given the
prevalence rates of opioid abuse among teens, it will be
important to evaluate the OARS' effectiveness at determin-
ing risk in a younger population.
Unfortunately, information about the race, marital sta-
tus, and current use of opioid analgesics for pain were not
available to the authors for Study 3. Additionally, it is not
known how many subjects did not complete the OARS as a
part of Study 3, because the investigators were only pro-
vided with data from subjects who completed the full
assessment and there may be unique characteristics about
the population who did not complete the measure. Finally,
the investigators were not able to obtain additional meas-
ures in Study 3, as in Study 2, so it is neither possible to
evaluate convergent validity from the data in Study 3, nor
to evaluate the generalizability of the preliminary evidence
of validity in Study 2 to the results of Study 3. However,
preliminary convergent validity with the SOAPP-R was
established using an earlier iteration of the OARS. These
determinations of criterion and predictive validity will need
to be firmly established in future research.
To further provide support of the instruments validity,
it will be helpful to compare patient responses on similar
constructs across measures and to engage in a more con-
trolled study, perhaps including the results of a structured
interview and other assessment further exploring personal
and familial psychiatric and substance abuse history,
comorbid medical conditions, history of ABs including
legal involvement, coping skills for managing both physi-
cal and emotional pain and distress, and so on.
Ongoing and future research endeavors will elicit evi-
dence of convergent and predictive validity, and will
include analysis of specificity and sensitivity when com-
paring OARS results to biological factors like urine drug
tests, to reports from the Department of Professional
Licensing (DOPL) Controlled Substance Database, and to
other measures including but not limited to the SOAPP-R.
Future research should continue to evaluate the external
validity of this instrument, comparing it to other relevant
data types (e.g. self- and clinician-administered mood and
symptom scales) and other measures of abuse risk level.
Additionally, the OARS will be evaluated for use with
other pain populations (e.g. acute pain, geriatric popula-
tions, etc.). Given the many reasons people may seek pre-
scription opioids and may be motivated to exaggerate or
otherwise misreport their symptoms and experiences, it
will be valuable to develop a brief malingering, desirability,
and consistency-in-reporting add-on component to help
identify potential drug-seeking individuals and non-illicit
inadequate reporting by patients. Finally, it will be impor-
tant to examine the utility of the OARS across treatment as
a safety and compliance monitoring measure. It may be
useful to adapt the measure to be more appropriate as an
effective measure for monitoring.
Appropriate and effective risk screening can help to
lower the rates of opioid abuse, overdose, and death, reduce
incidence of inaccurate or missed diagnoses, and doctor
shopping, and decrease costs for patients, providers, and
insurers by providing additional information concerning
patient's backgrounds and potential risk factors (Chou
et al., 2009a, 2009b). The OARS was developed as a com-
prehensive measure to assess a variety of elements shown
by the literature to be predictive of increased risk of abuse,
and meets a demand for effective risk stratification in the
face of the significant public health crisis that is prescrip-
tion opioid. The OARS is a promising tool in opioid risk
management that could be used to improve patient out-
comes and reduce risk of opioid abuse.
