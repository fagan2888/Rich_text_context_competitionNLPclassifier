Abstract
Background: Medical and psychiatric comorbidities are commonly comorbid with diabetes. Race and ethnicity
may, however, modify the link between medical and psychiatric comorbidities in individuals with diabetes. In this
study we compared Non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, and Caribbean Blacks with diabetes for the association
between number of comorbid medical conditions and lifetime and 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD) in
individuals with diabetes.
Methods: Data came from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), 2001­2003. We included 603 patients with
diabetes (75 non-Hispanic Whites, 396 African Americans, and 131 Caribbean Blacks). Number of comorbid medical
conditions was the independent variable, lifetime and 12-month MDD were dependent variables, and age, gender,
education, marital status, employment, and body mass index were covariates. Race- and ethnic- specific logistic
regressions were used to determine race and ethnic differences in the associations between number of chronic
medical conditions and lifetime and 12-month MDD, while the effect of all covariates were controlled.
Results: Number of chronic medical conditions was positively associated with lifetime MDD among non-Hispanic
Whites (OR = 1.719, 95 % CI = 1.018 ­ 2.902) and African Americans (OR = 1.235, 95 % CI = 1.056­ 1.445) but not
Caribbean Blacks (P > .05). Number of chronic medical conditions was also associated with 12-month MDD among
non-Hispanic Whites (OR = 1.757, 95 % CI = 1.119 ­ 2.759) and African Americans (OR = 1.381, 95 % CI = 1.175 - 1.623)
but not Caribbean Blacks (P > .05).
Conclusions: This study shows race- and ethnic- differences in the association between number of medical
comorbidities and MDD among patients with diabetes. These findings invite researchers to study the mechanisms
behind race- and ethnic- differences in vulnerability and resilience to the mental health effects of chronic medical
conditions.
Introduction
With a trend which is increasing in many countries [1],
diabetes currently affects about 350 million people world-
wide [2]. With 465 billion dollars direct medical cost, dia-
betes is responsible for about 10 % of total healthcare
expenditures in the United States [1].
Possibly due to its complications [3, 4] and also its ef-
fects on activities of daily living and well-being and social
life [5­9], individuals with diabetes are at higher risk of de-
pression [10, 11]. The prevalence rate of depression is
three-times higher in people with type 1 diabetes and
nearly twice as high in people with type 2 diabetes com-
pared to controls [12]. Up to 75 % of adults with diabetes
have at least one comorbid medical conditions [13]. High
rates of depression and comorbid medical conditions are
an essential aspect of diabetes, emphasizing the need for
collaborative care for patients with diabetes [14].

Screening, diagnosis, and treatment of comorbid med-
ical and psychiatric conditions - defined as coexisting
chronic diseases [11]- should be considered as an essential
part of patient care, quality assurance, and evaluation of
response to treatment [15]. As most patients with index
medical diseases such as diabetes also suffer from comor-
bid health conditions [15], studying the influence of co-
morbid conditions on health outcomes helps health care
providers to better plan the follow up of patients' health
[16, 17].
Number of chronic medical conditions is one of the
commonly used measures of comorbidity in epidemio-
logical and community-based studies [18­21]. In this ap-
proach, comorbidity is measured based on number, not
type, of medical conditions [22­28]. Studies have shown
that number of comorbid conditions is associated with
low well-being [29­33], functional status, health related
quality of life [34], and higher disability [34] and mortality
[35]. Patients with diabetes and comorbid conditions are
at higher risk of insulin resistance [13, 36]. Unfortunately,
the existing literature on the link between co-morbidity
and health and well-being [37­51] does not provide infor-
mation on this association among patients with diabetes.
Very few studies have tested if race and ethnicity interfere
with the effects of medical comorbidities on the mental
health of individuals with diabetes or other index diseases.
Race and ethnicity determine social class and life experi-
ences, personalities, identities, values, exposures, resources
and assets. In this view, even if separate effects of risk and
resilience factors are similar across groups, their additive
and multiplicative effects may be different across subgroups
[52­60]. This can be in part due to differential overlap of
risk and protective factors, or different distribution of con-
founders and mediators. Race and ethnicity shape human's
identity, life experience, values, social power, and access to
individual and environmental assets and resources that in
turn determine distribution, vulnerability, and resilience of
individuals to risk and protective factors [18, 56]. In this
view, race and ethnicity operate as contextual factors that
modify resilience and vulnerability to the separate, additive,
and multiplicative effects of risk and protective factors.
As race and ethnicity have shown to moderate the link
between medical and psychiatric conditions [18, 52­60]
and in response to the gap of knowledge on race and ethnic
differences in the associations between medical and psychi-
atric comorbidities among patients with diabetes, the
current study compared non-Hispanic Whites, African
Americans, and Caribbean Blacks with diabetes for the as-
sociation between number of medical comorbidities and
lifetime and 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD).
Methods
The current study used a cross sectional design. We bor-
rowed data from the National Survey of American Life
(NSAL), 2001­2003. The NSAL has been conducted as
a part of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology
Surveys (CPES). The study was funded by the National
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).
Ethics
The study protocol received approval by the Institutional
Review Board of the University of Michigan. Participants
received monetary compensation. Data was kept fully con-
fidential, and all data were collected, restored, and ana-
lyzed in an anonymous fashion. All participants provided
written consent.
Participants
The NSAL methodology, including sampling, process, and
interviewer training, has been described elsewhere [61­63].
The NSAL used a national household probability sample of
adults (18 years and older). African Americans were resi-
dents of large cities, other urban areas, or rural areas.
Caribbean Blacks were sampled from large cities.
Race and ethnicity
African-American individuals were identified as Blacks
who did not identify any ancestral tie in the Caribbean.
Caribbean Blacks were composed of Blacks who self-
identified as being of Caribbean ancestry. The non-
Hispanic White population included all Caucasian adults
except for those who reported Hispanic ancestry [64].
Enrollment to the NSAL
The NSAL survey population included US adults (age 18
and older) who were African Americans, Caribbean Blacks
or Whites and resided in households located in the coter-
minous 48 states. The NSAL sample was restricted to
adults who were able to complete the interview in English.
Institutionalized individuals (e.g. including those in
prisons, jails, nursing homes, and long-term medical or
dependent care setting) were excluded [64].
Sampling
The NSAL applied a multi-stage sampling design. The
`core' sample for the NSAL was a national area probability
sample from which African Americans and Whites were
sampled. The sampling also included a special supplemen-
tal sample of households in areas of high Caribbean Black
residential density. The design of the NSAL Core sample
closely resembled the National Survey of Black Ameri-
cans, 1979­80, which was designed to be optimal for
drawing the African-American sample. The NSAL na-
tional area probability sample was selected independently
of other CPES samples [64].

Interview
All interviews were conducted in English. For 86 % of the
respondents, data was collected through face-to-face
computer-assisted interviews. Telephone interviews were
used for collection of data of the remaining 14 % of the
participants. Interviews lasted 140 min on average. Re-
sponse rate was 72.3 % overall. The response rate was
70.7 % for African Americans, 77.7 % for Caribbean
Blacks, and 69.7 % for non-Hispanic Whites.
Measures
Socio-demographic characteristics
Demographic (age and gender) and socio-economic
(marital status, and geographic region of the country)
characteristics were control variables in this study.
Marital status was operationalized as a three level cat-
egorical variable (Divorced/Separated/Widowed, Never
Married, and Married) while country of origin was a four
level variable (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West).
Number of comorbid medical comorbidities
Number of comorbid medical conditions was measured
using self-reported history of doctor-diagnosed chronic
medical conditions, from 13 medical conditions that
could occur in addition to diabetes. Respondents were
asked about the following conditions: Arthritis/rheuma-
tism, peptic ulcers, cancer, hypertension, chronic liver
disease, chronic kidney disease, stroke, asthma, other
chronic lung diseases, atherosclerosis, sickle cell disease,
heart disease and glaucoma. Self-reported history of
doctor-diagnosed chronic medical conditions has been
shown to be accurate [65].
Outcomes
A modified version of the World Mental Health (WHO)
Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was
used to measure lifetime and 12-month MDD. The CIDI
is a fully structured diagnostic interview that is designed
to measure a wide range of DSM-IV based non-psychotic
mental disorders. The CIDI has been used in the World
Mental Health project [66]. The CIDI is used by trained
lay interviewers to generate diagnoses of lifetime and re-
cent DSM-IV-TR / ICD-10 disorders [67]. Clinical re-
appraisal studies have documented high concordance of
CIDI diagnoses with diagnoses made by psychiatrists [68,
69]. Investigation of area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) has found excellent concord-
ance between CIDI and the Structured Clinical Interview
for DSM-IV diagnoses of MDD. Additionally, the preva-
lence differences between CIDI and Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) are non-significant at the
optimal CIDI diagnostic thresholds. Thus, CIDI operating
characteristics are equivalent for MDE to those of the best
alternative screening scales [70]. CIDI is also known to
provide valid findings for Blacks and their ethnic groups
[71­73].
Statistical analysis
To consider the NSAL's multi-stage sample design, we
used Stata 13.0 for data analysis. For all our analyses, we
applied weights due to strata, clusters, and non-response.
As a result, results are nationally representative. We used
sub-population survey command for all our analyses.
Race/ethnic- specific logistic regressions were applied for
data analysis. We used number of comorbid medical con-
ditions as the independent variable, demographic and
socio-demographics as controls, and lifetime and 12-
month MDD as outcomes. Adjusted Odds Ratios (OR)
and 95 % Confidence Intervals (CI) were reported. P-
values less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
Most NSAL participants in all ethnic groups were be-
tween 30 and 44 years of age. Almost half of NSAL partic-
ipants in each ethnic group were women. While most
non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans were born
inside the US, most Caribbean Blacks were born outside
the US. Although most non-Hispanic Whites and African
Americans lived in the South, the Northeast represented
most Caribbean Blacks (Table 1).
In summary, number of medical comorbidities was posi-
tively associated with lifetime MDD among non-Hispanic
Whites (OR = 1.719, 95 % CI = 1.018 ­ 2.902) and African
Americans (OR = 1.235, 95 % CI = 1.056­ 1.445) but not
Caribbean Blacks (P > .05) with diabetes (Table 2). Number
of medical comorbidities was associated with 12-month
MDD among non-Hispanic Whites (OR = 1.757, 95 % CI
= 1.119 ­ 2.759) and African Americans (OR = 1.381, 95 %
CI = 1.175 ­ 1.623) but not Caribbean Blacks (P > .05) with
diabetes (Table 3).
Discussion
The present study documented racial and ethnic varia-
tions in the association between number of medical co-
morbidities and MDD among individuals with diabetes.
Our findings suggest that number of medical comorbidi-
ties is associated with higher odds of lifetime and 12-
month MDD among non-Hispanic Whites and African
Americans, but not Caribbean Blacks with diabetes. Al-
though there is a well-established literature on the effect
of medical comorbidities in diabetes and other index med-
ical conditions [74, 75], very little is known about race and
ethnic differences in these links [18, 52, 60].
Our finding regarding the positive association between
number of medical comorbidities and MDD among non-
Hispanic White and African American individuals with
diabetes is in line with the findings from previous studies
Lankarani and Assari Journal of Diabetes & Metabolic Disorders (2015) 14:56 Page 3 of 8
[51, 76]. There are also studies not showing any effects
for comorbidities on patients' outcomes [77, 78]. We
also could not show an association between number of
medical comorbidities and MDD among Caribbean
Black individuals with diabetes. The remaining ques-
tion is what psychosocial factors explain race and eth-
nic differences in the link between medical and mental
health.
Some researchers believe that the effect of somatic co-
morbidity on well-being and health is independent of
type of comorbidity, index disease, outcome, and popu-
lation. Although medical comorbidities worsen a wide
range of objective and subjective outcomes [19], our
study suggests that these effects may vary across popula-
tions. Thus, although health care providers should take a
holistic approach to the subjective well-being of patients
with any index disease such as diabetes [19], such inter-
ventions can also benefit from tailoring based on race
and ethnicity.
Medical comorbidities are rules rather than exceptions
[19]. As comorbidities influence multiple aspects of
subjective health, health care providers should pay spe-
cial attention to the existing physical and mental comor-
bidities; such a comprehensive approach may improve
physical and mental well-being of patients [51]. Physi-
cians and other health care providers who deliver care
to patients with diabetes should evaluate patients for
other comorbid medical and mental conditions includ-
ing MDD, however, the screening and management pro-
tocols that are tailored based on race and ethnicity may
be superior in efficacy. In all groups, however, regardless
of race and ethnicity, early detection and treatment of
comorbid conditions should be considered as a univer-
sal goal.
Although it is not only the index medical condition
but also comorbid conditions that impose risk to the
well-being of patients, health care providers have a ten-
dency to exclusively focus on the index disease. Any
medical decision for a patient with diabetes should be
made while taking into account all medical and psychi-
atric comorbid conditions. Unfortunately, less has been
discussed about the importance of incorporating medical
and psychiatric comorbidities in the process of care for
racial and ethnic minority patients with chronic medical
conditions such as diabetes [79, 80].
Comorbidity affects prognosis of medical conditions,
and diabetes is not an exception [81­85]. Primary health
care providers and also specialists should always be en-
couraged to consider all chronic medical and mental
comorbidities in the process of decision-makings re-
garding treatment choices [79, 80, 86]. The current
study provides a better understanding of racial and
ethnic differences in the effect of comorbid medical
conditions on MDD of patients with diabetes, and this
information will hopefully help with the medical
decision-making related to the care of patients with
diabetes [87].
Before any final conclusion, all limitations of the
current study should be discussed. Due to the cross sec-
tional nature of our study, causal association is implaus-
ible. The results do not suggest whether MDD is a risk
factor for multiple comorbid conditions, or comorbid
medical conditions cause MDD. The study did not sam-
ple U.S. residents who were not able to undergo an
interview in English. Type of chronic comorbid condi-
tions was not entered into the analysis, as well. This is
particularly important because various chronic medical
conditions may have different psychological correlates
[88]. In addition, diabetes and also comorbid medical
conditions were measured using self-reported data,
which is subjected to measurement error (recall bias).
Furthermore, the result of our study is generalizable to
the community sample of adults with diabetes, not ne-
cessarily to a clinical sample of patients with diabetes.
Finally, it was also unknown if comorbid conditions such

as heart disease or stroke were complications of diabetes
or not. Future research should differentiate between
medical comorbidities (such as hypertension, which are
independent of the diabetes diagnosis) and medical com-
plications associated with diabetes (e.g. micro-vascular
or macro-vascular complications) which are secondary
to diabetes. Due to the above limitations, the results
should be interpreted with caution. More research is
needed to better understand race and ethnic differences
in the role of medical comorbidities in shaping psycho-
logical well-being of patients with diabetes and other
conditions [18, 52, 60, 89, 90].
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that among individuals with diabetes,
race and ethnicity moderate the association between num-
ber of medical comorbidities and MDD. This information
may help a wide range of health care providers such as en-
docrinologists, internists, psychiatrists and family physi-
cians who are involved in providing health care for
individuals with diabetes. Patients with diabetes should be
screened for multiple comorbid medical conditions and
MDD, regardless of their race and ethnicity, however, mul-
tiple comorbid medical conditions and MDD tend to clus-
ter more strongly among non-Hispanic White and African
