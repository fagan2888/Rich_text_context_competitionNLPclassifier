Summary
In order to identify novel genetic variants that influence plasma lipid concentrations, we performed a genome-wide
association study (GWAS) comprised of 411 children under 18 years of age, ascertained at St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital, all of whom were of European, African, or Mexican descent. Promising associations (p < 10-5) were subsequently
examined in 1040 additional youths and 3508 adults from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), a diverse population-based study. Three genotype­phenotype associations replicated in NHANES III
youths and three associated in NHANES III adults at p < 0.05; however, no single association was significant in both youths
and adults. The most significant association (p = 0.009) in NHANES III youths was between low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) and intronic rs2429917 among participants of African descent. Given the known age dependency
of lipid levels, we also tested for gene­age interactions in NHANES III participants across all ages. We identified a
significant (p = 0.024) age-dependent association between SGSM2 rs2429917 and LDL-C. This finding illustrates the
utility of using children to discover novel variants associated with complex phenotypes and the importance of considering
age-dependent genetic effects in association studies of lipid levels.

Introduction
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified
many common genetic variants that contribute to normal
variation in lipid traits. The largest GWAS meta-analysis to
date, containing greater than 100,000 individuals of European
descent, identified 95 loci that were independently asso-
ciated with total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) (Teslovich et al., 2010).
Combined, these loci explained only 25­30% of the
genetic variance, leaving a majority of the genetic variance
unexplained.
Some have argued that the "missing heritability" observed
for most complex human traits is due, in part, to unidentified
genetic and nongenetic modifiers (McCarthy & Hirschhorn,

2008). Very few GWAS have tested for and identified genetic
modifiers as the statistical methods and approaches have yet
to be developed that will fully exploit these data (Cordell,
2009; Thomas, 2010). Also, few GWAS have collected the
data necessary to test for modifiers, particularly environmental
exposures that modify genetic associations.
Age, a potential modifier of the lipid trait distribution due
to genetics, has been relatively unexplored. It is known that
children and adolescents have different lipid distributions
compared with adults (Hickman et al., 1998; Jolliffe &
Janssen, 2006). Indeed, the National Cholesterol and Educa-
tion Program (NCEP) provides a set of lipid and lipoprotein
guidelines specific for children and adolescents (Expert Panel
Blood Cholesterol Levels Child Adolesc, 1992). Furthermore,
the increase in the means and variances of most lipid param-
eters as humans age has been well established (Reilly et al.,
1990; Ericsson et al., 1991; Heller et al., 1993; Boomsma
et al., 1996; Snieder et al., 1997). How much of that age
dependency is due to increases in environmental or genetic
variance, or both, is still left to be determined. Preliminary

studies of complex traits such as body mass index (BMI)
and systolic blood pressure suggest that, over time, while
the contribution of genes to a phenotype remains relatively
constant, environmental exposures are thought to increase
the phenotypic variance (Brown et al., 2003). Thus, the
accumulation effects of environmental exposures (i.e., diet,
exercise, or smoking) may increase the phenotypic variance
of complex traits such as BMI and lipids over time, making
it more difficult to detect genotype­phenotype associations.
All GWAS studies of the lipid traits (HDL-C, LDL-C,
and TG) have been performed in adults (>18 years of age)
(Hindorff et al., 2010), a population exposed to environmen-
tal factors that influence lipid trait distributions for at least two
decades. While these GWAS have been successful in identi-
fying genetic variants associated with lipid traits, we propose
that the study of younger participants such as children will
identify additional variants masked by the age dependency
well documented for these traits. To identify these novel vari-
ants associated with HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG levels, we per-
formed a GWAS in 411 children of European, African, or
Mexican descent ascertained at St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital followed by replication in an additional dataset of
youths from the Third National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (n = 1040; NHANES III). Replicated genetic
variants were formally tested for an interaction with age in
the larger NHANES III dataset with adults (n = 3508). Gene
discovery in children followed by testing for interactions in
adults has identified one lipid trait-associated locus potentially
modified by age and represents a modest step toward identify-
ing the full genetic architecture of the lipid trait distributions
in human populations.
Materials and Methods
Subjects in the discovery GWAS were drawn from the To-
tal Therapy Study XV, a prospective study of children un-
dergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL),
initiated in 2000 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
to investigate outcomes of a new treatment approach (Pui
et al., 2009). From June 2000 to October 2007, a total
of 501 newly diagnosed patients aged 1­18 years were en-
rolled in the study, 411 of whom were evaluable for both
serum lipids and genome-wide genotyping. Race/ethnicity
was inferred using germ-line genotypes as previously de-
scribed (Yang et al., 2009) based on genotype-based hier-
archical clustering of patients and using data from the In-
ternational HapMap cell lines [n = 90 Utah residents with
Northern and Western European ancestry from the Cen-
tre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain collection (CEU)
(European); 90 Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI); 30 Han
Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB); and 30 Japanese in Tokyo,
Japan (JPT) (Asians)] as references. Patients exhibiting >90%
European, African, or Asian ancestries were classified as
White, Black, or Asian, respectively; "Hispanic" status was
inferred for those patients who were self-declared Hispanics
who also had less than 90% of European, African, and Asian
ancestries. The remaining patients were labeled as "other" and
were not included in this analysis. Serum levels of HDL, LDL,
and TG were measured directly using standard enzymatic
techniques (Roche Diagnostics, IN) as described in Kawedia
et al. (2011). All lipid measurements were taken on consoli-
dation day 15 of treatment (at least 4 weeks from the last dose
of glucocorticoid or asparaginase) and were nonfasting.
Participants in the St. Jude study were genotyped with ei-
ther the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K and 100K or 6.0 array.
Only common SNPs genotyped across both platforms were
considered for analysis. SNPs were excluded from the analysis
based on genotyping call rates per SNP (98%) and minor
allele frequency (0.01). From a total of 532,546 SNPs geno-
typed, 420,005 (79%) passed quality control thresholds. Tests
of association between each genetic variant assuming an ad-
ditive genetic model and natural log-transformed lipid trait
were implemented in PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) using lin-
ear regression, stratified by race/ethnicity.
Ascertainment of the NHANES III and method of DNA
collection have been previously described (Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, 1994). Briefly, NHANES III is a
cross-sectional survey that was conducted from 1988 to 1994
by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention. Like all
the NHANES, NHANES III is a complex survey design that
oversampled minorities (non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican
Americans), the young, and the elderly. Blood samples were
obtained at a central location known as the Mobile Exami-
nation Center (MEC). Serum TC, TG, and HDL cholesterol
were measured using standard enzymatic methods and LDL
cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald equation, with
missing values assigned for samples with TG levels greater
than 400 mg/dL (Center for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, 1996). Beginning with phase 2 of NHANES III, DNA
samples were collected from study participants aged 12 years
and older. Race/ethnicity was self-identified as non-Hispanic
White, non-Hispanic Black, Mexican American, or other.
All NHANES III procedures were approved by the CDC
Ethics Review Board and written informed consent was ob-
tained from all participants. The present study was approved
by the CDC Ethics Review Board. Because the study inves-
tigators did not have access to personal identifiers, this study
was considered nonhuman subjects research by the Vanderbilt
University Institutional Review Board.
A total of 65 SNPs were carried forward for replication
in NHANES III and were targeted for genotyping using
Sequenom's iPLEX Gold assay on the MassARRAY platform
(San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions

(www.sequenom.com). One SNP, rs4811011, failed assay
design and was subsequently genotyped using Applied
Biosystem's TaqMan (Foster City, CA). A total of 57 SNPs
were genotyped successfully (genotyping call rate >95%);
however, five SNPs failed blinded duplicates quality control
measures as required by CDC and were excluded from further
analyses. The remaining SNPs were tested for deviations
from Hardy­Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) within each
racial/ethnic group and all had HWE p-values >0.01 in at
least two populations, as required by CDC. All genotype
data reported here were deposited into the NHANES III
Genetic database and are available for secondary analysis
through CDC.
Genotype­phenotype tests of associations for the 52 SNPs
and the three natural log-transformed lipid traits were per-
formed in SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) using
linear regression, assuming an additive genetic model, and
unweighted for selection and nonresponse biases. Single-SNP
analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity, adjusted for age and
sex and, for the adult cohort (>18 years), were limited to fast-
ing individuals not on lipid-lowering medications. Tests for
interactions between age and genotype were also considered
in these regression models, excluding the adjustment for age.
Replication and interaction associations were deemed signif-
icantly significant at p < 0.05. Data were accessed remotely
from the CDC's Research Data Center (RDC) in Hyattsville,
Maryland using Analytic Data Research by Email (ANDRE).
Differences in lipid levels between the St. Jude and
NHANES III cohort and between genotype groups were
tested in STATA 10 using a standard two-sample t-test with
unequal variances. Manhattan plots were produced using code

Results
Study Population Characteristics
Across all three racial/ethnic subpopulations, St. Jude children
with ALL had consistently lower mean LDL-C, and higher
mean HDL-C and mean TG compared to NHANES III
youths (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1). The means of
some lipid levels (HDL-C in Whites and Hispanics LDL-C in
Whites and Hispanics) were statistically significantly different
between the two studies of children, with differences in means
of up to 18.8 mg/dL (Table 1: Supplementary Table S1).
These differences in lipid levels are most likely related to the
older mean age and/or the larger percentage of females in
NHANES III youths compared with St. Jude children rather
than health status, as none of the medications used during the
consolidation stage of therapy for ALL are known to affect
lipid levels, per se.
When comparing the two NHANES III replication
datasets, not surprisingly (Expert Panel Blood Cholesterol
Levels Child Adolesc, 1992; Hickman et al., 1998; Snieder
et al., 1999; Jolliffe & Janssen, 2006), adults had different lipid
profiles compared to youths with statistically higher mean
LDL-C and TG levels across all subpopulations (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table S2). Mean HDL-C levels were signifi-
cantly higher in White adults and significantly lower in His-
panic adults compared to youths, although the differences
were small (2.3 and 1.7 mg/dL, respectively).
Discovery GWAS Results
To identify novel common variants associated with HDL-
C, LDL-C, and TG levels in children, we performed a
genome-wide association screen in all three subpopulations
of the St. Jude cohort. No SNP surpassed genome-wide sta-
tistical significance (p < 5 × 10-7) (Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium, 2007) for any of the analyses; how-
ever, four SNPs approached that threshold and were sig-
nificantly associated at p < 1 × 10-6 (Fig. 1 and Sup-
plementary Table S3). In Whites, two SNPs (intergenic
rs4742455 and USH2A rs17026635) were associated with
transformed HDL-C (p = 5.18 × 10-6 and p = 6.33 ×
10-6, respectively). In Hispanics, intergenic rs7790255 and
GBAS/MRPS17 rs15892 were associated with transformed
TG (p = 2.38 × 10-6 and p = 9.42 × 10-6, respectively).

Age Modifies Lipid Genetics
The latter two SNPs are in very high linkage disequilib-
rium (LD; r2 = 0.91) in the Hispanic subpopulation and
therefore likely represent the same association. Across all three
lipid traits and all three racial/ethnic groups, 65 associations
were significantly associated at p < 1 × 10-5 and carried
forward for replication in NHANES III youths.
Replication in NHANES III Youths and Adults
Next, we tested if the novel associations observed in the dis-
covery GWAS would replicate in an independent study of
children. For the replication study, a total of 1040 youths
(12­18 years of age) in NHANES III were genotyped for
65 SNPs, 52 of which passed assay design and quality control
measures (see Methods and Materials). Three of the 52 asso-
ciations replicated at p < 0.05 in NHANES youths (Table 2).
Two SNPs, SGSM2 rs2429917 and intergenic rs12190789,
were associated with transformed LDL-C at p = 0.009 and
p = 0.047, respectively, and CD96 rs16858329 was associated
with transformed TG at p = 0.048. All three of the significant
associations were in Blacks and the directions of effects were
concordant with those of the discovery cohort, although they
were of smaller magnitude.
We also conducted a second replication study in a large
cohort of fasting adults (>18 years of age) in NHANES III
to determine if associations initially discovered in children
would generalize to adults. Despite the considerable increase
in sample size, none of the three associations that replicated
in NHANES youths were also associated in NHANES adults
(Table 2). There were, however, three significant asso-
ciations in NHANES adults that were not replicated in
NHANES youths (TG and intergenic rs6477578 in Whites,
LDL and FRMD3 rs10868008 in Hispanics, and LDL and
FRMD3 rs1140077 in Hispanics; Table 2). The former
association was the most significant at p = 0.006, yet the
direction of effect was in the opposing direction compared
with the GWAS discovery study of St. Jude children.
The latter two associations most likely represent the same
association as rs10868008 and rs114007 are in complete LD
(r2 = 1.00) in our discovery GWAS among Hispanic samples.
Age as a Potential Modifier
As mentioned previously and shown in Table 1 and Sup-
plementary Table S2, mean HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG levels
differ significantly between adults and children/youths. Given
that three associations were discovered and replicated in
children but failed to generalize to adults, we explored the hy-
pothesis that genetic associations observed for the lipid traits
are modified by age. After testing for SNP-age interactions,
we observed a significant interaction (p = 0.024) between
age and SGSM2 rs2429917 with transformed LDL-C in
Blacks.
Up until about the fourth decade of life, participants ho-
mozygous for the major allele of rs2429917 (C, frequency =
0.96) had consistently lower LDL-C levels compared to CT
heterozygotes (Table 3) with the largest significant difference
in the 12­21 age group (mean difference = 17.25 mg/dL, p =
0.002). Any trend in mean differences is harder to detect later
in life due to smaller sample sizes for participants with the CT
genotype (n ranges from 0 to 7; Table 3). However, we did
note that participants with the CC genotype had significantly
lower mean LDL-C (mean difference = 24.14 mg/dL, p =
0.016) in the older 72­81 age group, a reverse of what we
observed in the 12- to 21-year-olds. These results lead us to
speculate that early in life (and possibly much later in life)
one's LDL-C concentration is dependent, in some small part,
on one's genotype at the rs2429917 locus.

Discussion
The aim of this study was to discover novel variants as-
sociated with lipid levels in children and to test if those
associations were also significant in adults. We performed a
GWAS of children undergoing treatment for ALL ascertained
at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and attempted repli-
cation in an independent population of youths and adults
from NHANES III. Three of the 52 lipid-genotype associa-
tions tested in NHANES III children replicated at p < 0.05,
including intronic SGSM2 rs2429917 at p = 0.009. However,
these associations did not generalize to NHANES III adults.
We also identified a genotype × age interaction with SGSM2
rs2429917 for transformed LDL-C in Blacks, supporting a
genetic basis for the differences observed in lipid levels in
children compared to older individuals.
Age, as a modifier of genetic association studies, has only
recently been highlighted in the literature. In one study of
the 100K data of the longitudinal Framingham Heart Study,
Lasky-Su et al. (2008) describe an age-dependent associa-
tion between ROBO1 and obesity where the association was
stronger among the pediatric cohorts compared with adult
cohorts. Although Lasky-Su et al. do not speculate on the
mechanism behind the age-dependent interaction, it is inter-
esting to note that heritability estimates for obesity in children
tend to be higher (Haworth et al., 2008) compared with es-
timates in adults (Brown et al., 2003). Somewhat consistent
with these observations in obesity are the observations of her-
itability estimates for the lipid traits. That is, some studies have
found that heritability of select lipid levels tends to decrease
with age (Heller et al., 1993; Beekman et al., 2002). However,
the review by Snieder et al. (1999) concluded that heritabil-
ity estimates for HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG remain relatively
stable with age.
While the magnitude of the genetic influence on lipid
metabolism may not change with age, the importance of dif-
ferent genes may. In other words, different genes may be ex-
pressed in childhood and adolescence compared to adulthood.
In regards to lipid metabolism, longitudinal twin studies sup-
port this possibility (Williams & Wijesiri, 1993; Friedlander
et al., 1997; Nance et al., 1998), and an extended parent-twin
study determined that different genes are expressed in ado-
lescence compared to adulthood (Snieder et al., 1997). It is
also possible that the same genes function throughout life, but
are expressed at different levels depending on the decade of
life. Supporting this latter hypothesis is the observation that
younger patients heterozygous for ABCA1 mutations that
cause Tangier disease have significantly higher HDL-C levels
than older patients heterozygous for ABCA1 mutations (Clee
et al., 2000). There is evidence that normal ABCA1 function
increases over time (Clee et al., 2000), which suggests that
pronounced HDL-C deficiency between age groups may be
highlighting the inability of heterozygotes to increase their
ABCA1 activity with increasing age.
Given the proposed and observed differences between
children and adults for these traits, we purposefully per-
formed a discovery study in children as this subset may
allow for discovery of novel genes associated with lipid levels
compared with previously published GWAS from adults.
The most promising novel candidate as a result of this study
is rs2429917, located in the intron of SGSM2, or small G
protein signaling modulator 2. SGSM2 is ubiquitously ex-
pressed in various tissues, including the liver, and as the name
implies, acts as a modulator of G-protein signaling through
its interaction with a subfamily of RAS proteins (Yang et al.,
2007). Proteins involved in G protein-mediated signal trans-
duction are associated with a number of cellular mechanisms,
including differentiation and proliferation. It is also important
to note that rs2429917 is located in a fairly gene-dense region
of chromosome 17, including SMG6, SRR, TSR1, MNT,
and METTL16, all within 100 kb flanking SGSM2. Based

on their biological functions, none of these neighboring
genes are compelling candidates for association with lipid
metabolism. However, SMG6 is an intriguing candidate given
its essential association with telomerase activity (Reichenbach
et al., 2003; Snow et al., 2003) and, thereby, aging. Deletion
of Est1p (the S. cervisiae homolog to human SMG6) in yeast
leads to ever-shorter telomeres over time despite functional
telomerase activity (Lundblad & Szostak, 1989). Telomere
shortening occurs in all mitotic tissues (excluding germline
tissue) as humans age and has been shown to contribute to
mortality in many age-related diseases, including heart disease
(Cawthon et al., 2003). Although these findings require
further study, it is interesting to speculate that these data may
point to the involvement of previously unsuspected pathways
contributing to lipid metabolism.
This study had several limitations, including that the dis-
covery GWAS was underpowered due to its small sample size.
Even with our largest population (n = 282 in Whites), and
an allele frequency of 5%, we had 80% power to detect only
large effect sizes (R2 > 11%) at genome-wide significance.
The majority of published lipid GWAS-identified variants
have small effect sizes and explain only a small percentage
of the variance of lipid traits in the population (Manolio,
2009; Teslovich et al., 2010). However, to our knowledge,
no GWAS has been performed on children with lipid lev-
els; therefore, it is unknown whether the effect size and/or
the significance of these well-known variants remain constant
over a lifetime.
Another limitation is that the discovery cohort consisted
of children undergoing treatment for ALL. Although med-
ications administered for treatment of ALL are not known
to affect lipid levels, side effects (such as loss of appetite or
nausea) of these medications may cause nutritional differences
that affect lipid levels. While this possibility was not directly
measured and, therefore, cannot be completely ruled out, we
observed that the children in the St. Jude cohort maintained
healthy appetites (data not shown).
Despite the small discovery sample size, we were able
to detect nominally significant associations, of which three
replicated at p < 0.05 in an independent dataset. Further-
more, examination of genetic variation known to influence
lipids in European-descent populations demonstrates that
true associations can be detected in spite of the low power of
the study. That is, of the 26 established lipid-associated SNPs
in 23 genes (including CETP, LPL, GCKR, APOB, etc.;
Table S4), we detected seven associations with p-values 0.05.
As an example, rs328 is a nonsynonymous SNP in LPL and
has been shown to have a reproducible effect (19 mg/dL in
one study) (Kathiresan et al., 2008) on lowering TG. In our
GWAS of children, rs1741102, a proxy for rs328 (r2 = 1 in
HapMap CEU), was associated at p = 0.02 with  = -0.17,
corresponding to -21.3 mg/dL, which is consistent in both
the previously reported magnitude and direction of effect.
A benefit of using NHANES III data is that it allows for
genetic studies in a large, diverse population with a wide
age range. However, it is a cross-sectional study. Since our
data suggest that there may be age-specific genetic influences,
longitudinal data are necessary to derive further conclusions
and to replicate this interaction.
Postmortem studies on young adults and children have
shown that atherosclerosis starts early in life (Expert Panel
Blood Cholesterol Levels Child Adolesc, 1992), even though
clinical symptoms usually do not manifest until decades later.
The potential temporal nature of factors, both genetic and
nongenetic, which contributes to cardiovascular disease, is
important for better understanding of the etiology of the
disease. While it is often assumed in genotype­phenotype as-
sociation studies that genetic effects are stable over a lifetime,
the possibility of important age-effects should not be ignored
when studying the genetics of lipid metabolism.
