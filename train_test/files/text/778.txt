Physicians' Views Of
Formularies: Implications For
Medicare Drug Benefit Design
Doctors' opinions on formularies tend to vary with the amount of their
practice revenues that comes from capitation.
by Bruce E. Landon, James D. Reschovsky, and David Blumenthal
ABSTRACT: As Congress considers introducing a drug benefit for Medicare, it will more
than likely adopt a program that uses a formulary. We examined data from the Community
Tracking Study Physicians Survey, a large, nationally representative study of physicians, to
learn about physicians' views of formularies. Our results suggest that several aspects of for-
mularies are associated with physicians' positive views about them. Policymakers should
consider imposing limits on the number of competing Medicare formularies operating in a
particular area, promoting the adoption and use of information technology, and incorporat-
ing financial incentives for physicians to adhere to formularies.
Evidence suggests that lack of drug coverage is an extremely
important issue for elderly Americans, particularly for the projected 27­35
percent of Medicare beneficiaries who lack any drug coverage.1 Nine out of
ten beneficiaries fill at least one prescription per year, and average annual
out-of-pocket spending was $884 in 2001. In 1999 those without drug coverage
spent almost twice as much out of pocket on prescription drugs as those with cov-
erage spent, although their total spending was 45 percent less.2 Those without in-
surance coverage have also been shown to fill fewer prescriptions and to spend a
high percentage of their disposable income on pharmaceuticals. Consequently,
many seniors are not filling prescriptions or are skipping doses to help soften the
economic impact and extend their prescriptions.3
As Congress considers introducing a Medicare drug benefit, it will more than
likely adopt a program that uses a formulary to help control costs and use. Al-
though they differ greatly in their reliance on the private sector, bills passed by
both the House and the Senate, as well as other bills proposed by Democrats and

Republicans, included provisions for the use of formularies.
In their most simplistic form, formularies are lists of drugs that are preferred by
a health plan, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), or employer. Formularies are
commonplace in the commercially insured population and typically tied to a set of
administrative or financial mechanisms that are designed to promote adherence to
the formulary by physicians and patients.4 These mechanisms typically include re-
stricting access to certain drugs, selecting preferred drugs, requiring preapproval,
or classifying drugs into different tiers, so that consumers are responsible for in-
creasing copayments for more expensive therapeutically equivalent medications
or ones for which the coverage plan could not negotiate discounts. Closed formu-
laries restrict coverage to drugs on the formulary, while open formularies cover
nonformulary drugs but often with higher consumer payments.
Because of such restrictions, many are concerned that drug formularies could
be harmful to vulnerable seniors.5 In addition, formularies introduce an additional
layer of complexity that could be difficult for the vulnerable elderly to negotiate.
For instance, some patients might not know when they could request an alterna-
tive drug if faced with a higher-tier copayment.
One voice missing in the debate about formularies is that of physicians. En-
acting a Medicare drug benefit that incorporates formularies will greatly expand
physicians' exposure to them. Nearly two-thirds of physicians obtain one-fourth
or more of their practice revenue from Medicare.6 Although a majority of Medicare
patients have drug coverage from a previous employer, a Medigap policy, or a
Medicare+Choice (M+C) health plan, a sizable minority has no such coverage.
Consequently, the use of formularies for Medicare beneficiaries as a whole is likely
to be lower than for other privately or publicly insured patients.
There are few systematic data on physicians' views of formularies. To fill this
gap, we used data from the Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physicians Survey
to inform this issue. We had three primary questions. First, how prevalent are for-
mularies, and what types of physicians have the greatest exposure to them? Sec-
ond, how might a Medicare drug benefit that includes formularies increase physi-
cians' exposure to them? Third, what are physicians' views on the usefulness of
formularies, and what factors influence these assessments? We conclude by draw-
ing lessons for the implementation of a Medicare prescription drug benefit that
uses formularies.
n Data source. The data for this study are from the third round of the CTS Phy-
sician Survey, a nationally representative telephone survey of 12,406 direct patient
care physicians, conducted between August 2000 and November 2001 for the Cen-
ter for Studying Health System Change. The survey sample, the largest in recent his-
tory, was designed to be representative of direct patient care physicians in the conti-
nental United States, as well as in selected communities or sites.7 The overall survey
response rate was 59 percent. All analyses are weighted to account for survey design
and survey nonresponse.

n Key variables. The survey asked physicians about the percentage of their pa-
tients who have drug coverage with formularies. Nine percent were unable to an-
swer this. These cases were imputed using a weighted sequential, hot-deck proce-
dure. Other key variables on attitudes toward formularies and use of relevant
information technology had very low item nonresponse, well below 1 percent.
Study Findings
n Exposure to formularies. Overall, physicians reported that an average of 57
percent of their patients had insurance coverage that included the use of formular-
ies, and more than two-thirds reported that half or more of their patients had such
coverage (Exhibit 1). Only 2 percent of physicians reported having no patients sub-
ject to formularies.
Exposure to formularies declined as the age of the physician rose and was
greater for female physicians than for male physicians. The proportion of patients
covered by formularies was higher for primary care physicians, particularly pedia-
tricians, as compared with specialists. Physicians in medical school­ and hospi-
tal-based practices had slightly higher percentages of patients with formularies
than those in groups and solo or two-physician practices. Physicians practicing in
group or staff-model health maintenance organizations (HMOs) on average re-
ported that 87 percent of their patients had formulary coverage, far higher than
physicians in all other practice settings.
Involvement with managed care. Not surprisingly, exposure to patients with formu-
laries is positively associated with the physician's exposure to managed care. To
analyze this relationship, we divided the sample of physicians into thirds, based
on the percentage of their practice's revenue from managed care. Those with the
highest managed care involvement reported that 71 percent of their patients had
formularies, compared with 45 percent of those with the lowest involvement (Ex-
hibit 1). We similarly divided the sample into three groups according to the per-
centage of practice revenue that is capitated. This shows a similar positive rela-
tionship with involvement with formularies, although not as strong.
FormulariesandMedicare. Physicians whose practices receive a majority of revenue
from Medicare reported that 50.7 percent of their patients have formularies, com-
pared with 62.1 percent for those physicians with less than 25 percent of practice
revenue from Medicare (p < .01). This suggests that a Medicare drug benefit is
likely to greatly expand physicians' exposure to formularies. Medical and surgical
specialists as well as physicians with low managed care involvement would be
most affected by a Medicare drug benefit that involves formularies. These physi-
cians are more likely to have both low exposure to formularies and a large depend-
ence on revenue from Medicare.
n Formularies' effect on medical care. Overall, nearly half of all physicians in-
dicated that they thought formularies had a negative effect on the quality and effi-
ciency of medical care (Exhibit 2). In contrast, only 13.4 percent thought that formu-

laries had a positive effect. These ratings varied considerably with both physicians'
personal characteristics and the characteristics of their practices. We also con-
ducted multivariate analyses of the likelihood of giving a positive or negative assess-
ment of formularies. The multivariate results closely mirrored the trends evident in
the bivariate results, so we do not report them here.8
Personal characteristics and medical specialty. Somewhat surprisingly, physicians age
fifty-five and older were more likely than those younger than age forty-five to give
positive ratings. In addition, physicians in various specialties had differing atti-
tudes toward formularies. Medical and surgical specialists were more likely than
other physicians to have neutral attitudes toward formularies. In contrast, inter-
nists and those in general or family practice were least likely to be neutral and
most likely to express both positive and negative feelings. Graduates of foreign
medical schools were much more likely than U.S. medical graduates to rate formu-
laries positively.
Practice setting. Practice setting was strongly related to ratings of formularies.
Just 12.4 percent of physicians in solo or two-physician practices and 8.9 percent
in group practices rated formularies as positive, compared with 39 percent of phy-
sicians practicing in group/staff-model HMOs. Because the latter typically deal
with patients from only their own health plan, they usually have only one formu-
lary to deal with, and it is often fully integrated into their office systems. These
patterns were mirrored for those rating the effect of formularies as negative.
Practice exposure to managed care. As in Exhibit 1, we assessed physicians' exposure
to managed care along several dimensions. Regardless of the measure, as managed
care exposure rises, the percentage of physicians who have neutral views about
formularies declines. With the exception of the number of managed care con-
tracts, which might indicate how burdensome dealing with multiple formulary
requirements is, greater exposure to managed care is generally associated with a
greater likelihood that a physician will express positive views about formularies.
For instance, 19 percent of physicians in practices with high exposure to capita-
tion expressed positive views about formularies, compared with only 11 percent
among those with low exposure. We should also note, however, that in
multivariable models controlling for both managed care exposure and the propor-
tion of practice revenue that was capitated, the degree of capitation appeared to
be more strongly related to positive views about formularies.9 The number of man-
aged care contracts a physician's practice has (which is presumably correlated
with the number of formularies the physician must deal with) is associated with
negative feelings toward formularies. Those with more than ten contracts were
significantly more likely than those with none were to view formularies negatively

Effect of information technologies. The relationship between number of contracts
and physicians' attitudes toward formularies suggests that the burden associated
with dealing with multiple formulary requirements is an important factor influ-
encing these attitudes. Information technology could be used to alleviate these
burdens. We found that physicians' use of information technology to write pre-
scriptions and check formulary information is strongly associated with how those
physicians rate formularies. Although each type of technology independently
serves to move physicians' attitudes in the positive direction, the use of both tech-
nologies together appears to be synergistic. Ten percent of physicians who do not
use either technology expressed positive attitudes toward formularies, compared
with almost 30 percent of physicians who use both technologies.
Conclusions And Policy Implications
As Congress considers a variety of proposals for implementing pharmaceutical
coverage for Medicare, it is likely that formularies will be a crucial aspect of most
approaches.10 Given this likelihood, it will be important for policymakers to con-
sider physicians' views on formularies and the aspects of practice that make these
views more positive. Nearly half of all physicians reported that formularies nega-
tively affect the quality and efficiency of care. Although we cannot dissect the ex-
tent to which this is attributable to the impact on quality versus the impact on ef-
ficiency, our analyses suggest that the increased hassle factor and resultant effects
on efficiency are major concerns to many physicians.
Insurers do not specifically compensate physicians for checking formulary lists,
writing prescriptions, or fielding calls from pharmacists when prescriptions do
not conform with formulary requirements. Recent cuts in physician payment
rates might have increased the problems Medicare beneficiaries face in accessing
physician care.11 This raises the question of whether new formulary requirements
would further burden physicians who serve Medicare beneficiaries, potentially
making them less likely to accept new Medicare patients or serve current ones.
n Need for information technology. Physicians who lack information technol-
ogy that can alleviate these hassles and those who are likely to have to deal with a
large number of different formularies are more likely to have negative attitudes
about formularies. These results suggest that policies to promote the adoption and
use of information technology for both prescription writing and formulary informa-
tion should be an important component of any new benefit package; its positive ef-
fects could extend beyond Medicare.
These features might include common specifications to facilitate linkages with
pharmacies and facilitating the electronic retrieval of formulary information. Phy-
sicians thus would spend less time trying to identify "covered" medications
among multiple formularies. These technologies, particularly those used for pre-
scription writing, could have the additional benefit of improving patient safety by

checking for drug interactions, assuring proper dosing, improving record keeping,
and diminishing problems with the interpretation of handwriting.12
n Pros and cons of multiple formularies. How managed care affects attitudes
toward formularies is more complicated. Physicians with the highest number of
managed care contracts tended to be less likely to view formularies positively, prob-
ably because of the inherent complexities of dealing with multiple coverage and for-
mulary arrangements. Consequently, policymakers might want to consider adopt-
ing policies that limit the number of PBMs, and implicitly formularies, that operate
in a particular geographic area. These actions, however, would have uncertain ef-
fects on any cost savings derived from the use of formularies. In addition, it would be
important to maintain several choices so that beneficiaries could find a plan that
covers most of the drugs they are taking.
n A role for financial incentives? Physicians with higher proportions of
capitated managed care revenue have more positive views. Although we cannot dis-
cern whether this finding is related to the types of physicians that choose to practice
in capitated arrangements, it suggests that when economic incentives favor the use
of formularies, physicians view them more positively. However, additional research
is needed to assess how risk-sharing arrangements or financial incentives might af-
fect Medicare beneficiaries' access to care. Appropriate financial incentives might
assure physicians' willingness to treat Medicare beneficiaries, although such incen-
tives need to be risk-adjusted for patients' severity of illness so as to avoid problems
specifically with access for the sickest beneficiaries. Lastly, when more patients have
coverage that includes formularies, physicians appear to have a more positive view of
formularies, perhaps because they gain experience in dealing with them.
n Study limitations. Our study results must be interpreted in light of several
limitations. Because of the nature of our survey, we were not able to distinguish be-
tween different types of formularies or ask physicians about detailed characteristics
of formularies such as prior authorization policies, inclusiveness, or the number and
magnitude of copayment tiers. We also could not ask the extent to which physicians
had dedicated support staff or systems in their offices to help deal with multiple for-
mularies. While we do not believe these limitations affect our main conclusions,
variability in these areas could also affect physicians' views of formularies.
As congress considers various str ategies for implementing a
pharmaceutical benefit for Medicare, it should consider adopting policies
that are associated with positive views about formularies by physicians.
This points to limits on the number of different Medicare formularies that exist in
a particular area, new policies to promote the adoption and use of information
technology for obtaining information and writing prescriptions, and possibly in-
corporating financial incentives for physicians or their parent organizations to ad-
here to formularies.
