Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
validity of BMI based on self-reported data by comparison
with technician-measured BMI and biomarkers of adiposity.
Research Methods and Procedures: We analyzed data
from 10,639 National Health and Nutrition Education Study
III participants 20 years of age to compare BMI calculated
from self-reported weight and height with BMI from tech-
nician-measured values and body fatness estimated from
bioelectrical impedance analysis in relation to systolic blood
pressure, fasting blood levels of glucose, high-density li-
poprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, and
leptin.
Results: BMI based on self-reported data (25.07 kg/m2) was
lower than BMI based on technician measurements (25.52
kg/m2) because of underreporting weight (0.56 kg; 95%
confidence interval, 0.71, 0.41) and overreporting
height (0.76 cm; 95% confidence interval, 0.64, 0.88). How-
ever, the correlations between self-reported and measured
BMI values were very high (0.95 for whites, 0.93 for blacks,
and 0.90 for Mexican Americans). In terms of biomarkers,
self-reported and measured BMI values were equally cor-
related with fasting blood glucose (r  0.43), high-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol (r  0.53), and systolic blood
pressure (r  0.54). Similar correlations were observed for
both measures of BMI with plasma concentrations of tri-
glycerides and leptin. These correlations did not differ ap-
preciably by age, sex, ethnicity, or obesity status. Correla-
tions for percentage body fat estimated through bioelectrical
impedance analysis with these biomarkers were similar to
those for BMI.
Discussion: The accuracy of self-reported BMI is sufficient
for epidemiological studies using disease biomarkers, al-
though inappropriate for precise measures of obesity prev-
alence.

Introduction
Many large epidemiological studies depend on self-re-
ported weight and height as surrogates for technician mea-
surements (1,2). Self-reported measures are more feasible to
collect for large population samples, less burdensome for
the study participants, and entail fewer costs than values
obtained by clinical measurements of height and weight.
Although there are many practical advantages of using
self-reported data, adiposity values calculated from these
measures, such as BMI, may be subject to inaccuracies
because of random and systematic errors, which in turn
affect the validity of the measures (3). For this reason, it is
important to quantify the degree to which self-reported
values agree with clinical measurements and whether these
participant-provided responses are sufficiently accurate to
be used in epidemiological studies.
More than two decades ago, Stunkard and Albaum (4)
reported a high accuracy of self-reported weights across
different ages and sexes. Also, Stewart (3) studied more
than 3000 subjects 14 to 61 years of age and found that
self-reported values are valid and reliable indicators of
measured weight and height, a finding that was confirmed
by subsequent studies (5­11). This work has expanded from

weight and height to BMI and to racial/ethnic subgroups
through larger, nationally representative U.S. studies (6,10).
Data from the Health and Nutrition Education Study III
(NHANES III)1 has shown that there is an increasing prev-
alence of obesity in the United States (12), and this dataset
has been used to assess the validity of classification of
overweight and obesity through the use of self-reported
weight and height by ethnicity, sex, and age (6,7,10). Gil-
lum et al. (10) found a substantial underestimation of the
prevalence of obesity based on self-reported height and
weight in women and Mexican-American men.
We have found no studies that compared the correlations
of biomarkers of disease with BMI based on self-reports and
technician measurements. While traditional anthropometric
measures such as weight and BMI are often used in epide-
miological studies, measures such as bioelectrical imped-
ance analysis (BIA) are used with increasing frequency to
better distinguish between fat and lean tissue (13,14). The
aim of this study is to assess the validity of BMI based on
self-reports in a nationally representative sample of U.S.
adults (NHANES III) by 1) comparison with BMI based on
technician measurements and 2) comparison of correlations
for BMI based on self-reports, BMI based on technician
measurements, and percent body fat (PBF) based on BIA
with disease biomarkers.
Research Methods and Procedures
NHANES III
The NHANES III study was conducted between 1988 and
1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This study was
designed to provide a nationally representative sample of
the U.S. population (2 months of age) and to collect
information on the health status of U.S. civilian noninstitu-
tionalized populations. NHANES III sample design reflects
a stratified multistage probability design that included over-
sampling of Mexican-American and black populations. This
was done to produce statistically reliable health estimates
for the two largest ethnic minority groups in the United
States. The sampling method was similar to those used in
previous Health and Nutrition Surveys, and details of the
sampling methods and methodological information have
been previously published (15,16).
NHANES III consisted of a survey and clinical exami-
nation. All participants were interviewed at home (N 
39,695), with 85.6% (n  33,994) invited to participate in
the clinical examination portion; 31,311 of those invited
received a clinical examination. The exam was performed in
a mobile examination center for all who were able and at
home for those who were unable to attend the mobile
examination center.
Measurements
Weight and height were measured by two methods: self-
reported and clinically examined. Self-reported measures
included in the at home survey, and clinical measurements
were collected at the clinical examination. Respondents
were asked, "How much do you weigh without clothes and
shoes," and "How tall are you without shoes" (15). These
self-reported values were recorded in inch and pound units
and converted to metric units. Subsequently, trained health
technicians measured the weight and height of those partic-
ipants who attended the clinical examination, as described
previously (15). Height was measured to the nearest milli-
meter using a fixed stadiometer. Body weight was measured
in kilograms (to the second decimal place) by a self-zeroing
digital weight scale for adults dressed in underpants, a
disposable paper gown, paper pants, and foam slippers. A
Toledo 2181 self-zeroing digital weight scale (Toledo
Scale, Columbus, OH) was used at the mobile examination
center, and a SECA Integra Model 815 Scale (SECA, Ru-
mily, France) was used for the home examination. Both
scales were standardized (15). Measured values refer to
weight and height measured by a physician during the
clinical examination.
For the first time in a NHANES study, bioelectrical
impedance resistance measures were also taken during the
clinical examination. To obtain PBF through BIA, patients
were instructed to lie on their backs while electrodes were
placed on their wrists and ankles. These electrodes delivered
a low-level alternating current (1 mA) measured at dis-
tinct frequencies between 5 KHz and 1 MHz (15). PBF from
BIA was used as a measure of body fat composition that
may not be captured through BMI measures. PBF was
calculated using prediction equations (14). First fat-free
mass (FFM) was calculated through the Deurenberg predic-
tion equation (17):
FFM  0.672  104 Ht2 (m)/BIA  3.1 Sex  3.9
(where M  1, F  0)
Total body fat (TBF) was defined as the difference between
weight and FFM. Finally, PBF was calculated as the ratio of
TBF to weight (kg).
PBF  (Wt  FFM)/Wt  TBF/Wt
Those participating in the survey portion of NHANES III
were not told that they might be weighed and measured later
during the clinical examination. Blinding the participants to
the fact that they would later be clinically measured helps
ensure that the self-reported measures will be more similar
to self-reported weight and height collected in epidemiolog-

ical studies. The time lapse between the survey and clinical
measurements at the mobile examination center was 4
weeks (15).
Continuous measures of BMI were calculated by dividing
weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. Measured
BMI was calculated using the weight and height recorded in
the physician's examination portion of the survey. The term
measured BMI is used here to describe BMI calculated
using measured weight and height. Self-reported BMI was
calculated from the previously mentioned questions, which
were part of the household survey; self-reported BMI will
be used to describe BMI calculated by self-reported weight
and height.
Fasting blood levels of glucose (FBG), triglycerides
(TGs), blood levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol
(HDLC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), C-reactive protein
(CRP), and leptin (LEP) were measured in blood collected
during the clinical examination (18).
Analytic Sample
All subjects in this analysis were participants in
NHANES III. Of the 31,311 individuals 2 months of age
who participated in the clinical examination, 10,639 met the
inclusion criteria. For this analysis, we first excluded all
participants who were 20 years old (14,281 participants).
Of the adult population, we also excluded those with re-
ported diabetes or diabetes treatment (1437 participants),
and, in addition, any of the remaining participants who used
antihypertensive medication or cholesterol-lowering treat-
ments (4162 participants). These treatments and diseases
could confound the examined associations and complicate
interpretation of the results. Finally, participants who were
missing self-reported or measured height or weight (792
participants) were excluded from this analysis, so that each
patient would have at least one self-reported measure of
BMI and one anthropometric measure. In addition, women
who were pregnant and participants with pacemakers were
excluded to ensure the accuracy of the BIA resistance data.
Sample sizes varied for the biological markers because of
missing values, with all analyses containing 10,000 par-
ticipants except for the analysis involving LEP (n  4203).
After all exclusions, 5239 men and 5400 women were
included in the full analysis; 4940 men and 5080 women in
the analysis for FBG; 4952 men and 5087 women for TG;
4929 men and 5078 women for HDL; 4973 men and 5122
women for SBP; 4932 men and 5074 women for CRP; and
2007 men and 2196 women for LEP. Of the participants
12 years of age, 17,726 patients had BIA resistance mea-
sures, of which we analyzed 9481 who met our inclusion
criteria.
Statistical Analysis
This study analyzed NHANES III data with SAS (version
8; Statistical Analysis System, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC)
software (19) to incorporate the sampling weights consistent
with the sample design of NHANES III. This was done to
compensate for the unequal probability of selection caused
by the complex, multistage design of the survey, adjustment
for noncoverage and nonresponse, and oversampling of
subgroups. SUDAAN was used to calculate estimates and
SE by taking into account the sampling weights and sample

design. Statistical sampling weights for the total mobile
examination center or the home clinically examined sam-
ples were used, when appropriate.
The error in self-reported weight was calculated as the
difference between self-reported and measured weight. Dif-
ferences were also calculated for height and BMI, for which
we calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Error in
self-reported weight, height, and BMI was calculated for
groups differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and age.
Adults were categorized by sex (male or female), age
group (60 or 60 years of age at interview), and BMI
category (25, 25 to 29.9, or 30 kg/m2). Means and SE
were calculated for self-reported and measured weight,
height, and BMI, as well as biological measures. Age was
categorized as 60 or 60 years to be consistent with
previous published papers that suggested an effect of age on
the validity of self-reported weight, height, and BMI (12).
BMI was categorized using the established World Health
Organization cut-points (20). Tables were stratified by age,
race/ethnicity, and sex.
To further study the association between self-reported
and measured BMI, we constructed a Bland-Altman plot
(21) of the differences in measured and self-reported BMI
vs. the average of these two values.
Outcome variables with skewed distributions, such as
self-reported weight and height, measured weight and
height, FBG, TG, HDL, SBP, CRP, and LEP were log-
transformed for the analyses. Adjusted multiple Pearson's
correlations were used to measure the correlation between
log-transformed self-reported variables and log-transformed
measured variables, as well as log-transformed biological

measures adjusted for potential confounders. These adjust-
ments took into account age, sex, and race/ethnicity varia-
tion in the previously listed categories. In the stratified
analyses, we adjusted for all confounders excluding the
stratification factor. We chose to use estimates that were
adjusted for potential confounders to evaluate the validity of
self-reported BMI because key sociodemographic variables
such as age, sex, and ethnicity are typically adjusted in an
epidemiological study of adiposity measures and health
outcomes. Also included in these models were categorical
alcohol consumption in the past year (four groups depen-
dent on the quartiles of frequency and quantity) and current
smoking status (current smoker or current nonsmoker). All
presented p values are two-sided.
Results
Population Characteristics
Table 1 shows the summary statistics for the anthropo-
metric measurements and biological markers of disease by
sex, race/ethnicity, and age group. Compared with men,
women had lower FBG and SBP but higher HDL and LEP.
Most notably, TG was higher in the Mexican-American men
than other groups and higher for participants 60 years of
age than for younger participants. Similar summary statis-
tics were found among subgroups by sex, race/ethnicity, and
age (Table 1).

group, are presented in Table 2. All correlation coefficients
describing the relationship between self-reported and mea-
sured weight were 0.92 or greater. There was greater vari-
ation in the correlations for height than for weight by sex,
race/ethnicity, and age, with the lowest correlations for
Mexican-American men 60 years (r  0.83) and Mexi-
can-American women 60 years (r  0.73). BMI calcu-
lated by self-reported variables was highly correlated with
that calculated by measured variables in the white (r 
0.95), black (r  0.93), and Mexican-American (r  0.90)
populations. Among the subgroups by age and sex, all
correlation coefficients for measured and self-reported BMI
were between 0.87 and 0.95.
Table 3 presents differences between measured and self-
reported weight and height. BMI based on self-reported data
(25.07 kg/m2) was lower than BMI based on technician
measurements (25.52 kg/m2) because of underreporting
weight (0.56 kg; 95% CI, 0.71, 0.41) and overreport-
ing height (0.76 cm; 95% CI, 0.64, 0.88). Women underre-
ported weight on average of 1.47 kg (95% CI, 1.66,
1.27), and the group of women with the highest BMI
(4.48 kg; 95% CI, 5.13, 3.84) had the largest differ-
ences in self-reported and measured weight. Height was

overreported by varying amounts in all subgroups. On av-
erage, men overreported their height to a greater degree than
women (1.16 vs. 0.37 cm). Differences in the two measures
of height were greater in the highest BMI group and in those
60 years (2.65 cm; 95% CI, 2.48, 2.83). The largest error
in BMI occurred in Mexican-American women whose mea-
sured BMI was 30 kg/m2 (2.25 kg/m2; 95% CI, 2.56,
1.94).
Figure 1 shows a Bland-Altman plot for measured and
self-reported BMI. Overall, the difference between mea-
sured and self-reported BMI was small, but it slightly in-
creased with increasing average values of these two BMI
measures. This shows a greater tendency for self-reported
BMI to underestimate true BMI with increasing adiposity.

were seen between the biomarkers and self-reported and
measured BMI. For all biological measures, the correlations
associated with BIA were either similar to or lower than
either BMI correlation value; in the case of SBP, the dif-
ference was substantial (Table 4). For the total population,
correlations between self-reported BMI and FBG (r 
0.43), HDL (r  0.53), and SBP (r  0.54) were not
different from those with measured BMI, whereas correla-
tions with TG and CRP were slightly lower for self-reported
BMI (Table 4). In contrast, the correlations between BIA
measures and disease biomarkers were substantially lower
than those for measured BMI. This difference existed in
all subgroups except for those 60 years old, for whom
the correlation between BIA and CRP was similar to those
with measured BMI (r  0.26). Similar correlations be-
tween self-reported and measured BMI with biomarkers
were also observed within different measured BMI catego-
ries (Table 5).
Discussion
Epidemiological studies have evolved in the past decades
since the Stunkard and Albaum publication (4). With the
increasing use of biomarkers of obesity-related disorders in
studies, understanding the use of self-reported anthropomet-
ric measures is important. This analysis of NHANES III
data indicates that self-reported and technician-measured
height and weight are highly correlated. We observed un-
derreporting of weight and overreporting of height, causing
a slight underestimation of BMI. This was most pronounced
in subgroups such as Mexican Americans and older partic-
ipants. Correlations of self-reported and measured BMI
with obesity-related biomarkers were similar not only to
each other, but also to those between BIA measures and
biomarkers. Although the correlations for self-reported BMI
and biomarkers, such as CRP and TG, were slightly lower
than for technician measured BMI, these differences do not
seem to be of a magnitude that is clinically significant. Both
measures showed a moderate to strong positive association
between adiposity and the studied biomarkers, and research-
ers would have drawn similar conclusions regardless of
which measure of BMI was used. The latter result agrees
with a previous analysis of the NHANES III data that found
BIA-estimated body fat was not superior to measured BMI
in predicting obesity-related markers (22).
Previous reports of NHANES datasets have found a
strong relation between self-reported and measured weight,
height, and BMI (6,8,10). Similar to Gillum et al. (10), we
found that self-reported BMI was under-reported in women
and Mexican Americans as a consequence of overreporting
height and underreporting weight (10). Variability in the
correlations was seen in different ethnic/racial groups. Also,
weight and BMI discrepancies were associated with age
group and measured BMI, as was noted by Kuczmarski et
al. (7) and Villanueva (6). Although many other studies
have examined the differences between self-reported and
measured values of weight (3­9,11,23), no other studies
have examined the correlation of self-reported anthropomet-
ric measures and disease biomarkers in nationally represen-
tative populations.
NHANES III is a large cross-sectional study of the U.S.
population designed for nationally representative samples
from the U.S., and results have been widely published. In
our analysis, the population includes men and women of
diverse ages and racial/ethnic backgrounds. Self-reported

measures of weight and height were taken in close proxim-
ity to the measured values but were obtained without the
participants knowing they would subsequently be mea-
sured. Therefore, the self-reported values are similar to what
would be obtained in an epidemiological study with only
self-reported measures. Different biological measures
known to be predictive of obesity-related disorders were
used to examine the overall use of different anthropometric
measures. The blood levels of biomarkers such as FBG,
TGs, and HDLC, as well as SBP, reflect levels of adiposity
(24), which makes these variables useful to compare the
performance of different anthropometric measures (25).
This study suggests that self-reported BMI can provide
sufficiently accurate information in epidemiological studies
in which the primary outcomes are disease biomarkers or
obesity-related diseases. PBF calculated through BIA was
not superior to BMI as a predictor of biological markers
known to be associated with adiposity and risk for obesity-
related diseases. Although we found self-reported BMI to
be highly correlated with measured BMI, some underesti-
mation of true BMI occurs when BMI is based on self-
reports. We therefore conclude that in most epidemiological
studies of adiposity-related conditions, using self-reported
BMI will produce minimal bias for the measure of associ-
ation, although it can lead to some underestimation of the
population prevalence of obesity.
