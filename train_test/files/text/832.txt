The purpose of this study is to examine alternative pathways to laborforce exit among older men. Based on the life
course perspective, we distinguish between crisp exits from the labor force, which are characterized as being
unidirectional, and blurred transition patterns, which include repeated exits, entrances, and unemployment spells.
Using longitudinal datafrom the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation, we find that one-quarter of the
sample of men aged 55 to 74 at first interview experienced at least one transition in laborforce status over a 28-month
observation period. Fewer than half of these can be characterized as crisp exitsfrom the laborforce. Our multivariate
analysis suggests that blurred transition patterns are likely part of an effort to maintain economic status in later life.
ALIFE COURSE approach to late-life work behavior
prompts us to consider the diversity of pathways out of
the labor force (Elder, 1985). Conventionally, a single,
unreversed, and unambiguous exit from the labor force is
cited as the normative pathway for relinquishment of the
worker role. Based on this assumption, much extant research
focuses on the timing of retirement as a discrete event.
Recent research illustrates clearly that these conventional
understandings characterize the experience of only a seg-
ment of the older population. For many individuals, the
retirement process is more consistent with the idea of a
"blurred" transition, in that the pathway out of the world of
work may span months or even years, may include repeated
moves in and out of the workforce, and may even include
periods during which the roles of worker and retiree are held
simultaneously. In shaping a strategy for analysis, such a
conceptualization directs our attention away from focusing
strictly on events and transitions, toward an examination of
sequences of behavior. Recent research on labor force re-
entry has documented one aspect of this sequence but ex-
cludes other key components.
We estimate the extent to which "crisp" exit patterns are
typical of older men, and examine the alternative patterns
evident in the life histories of individuals approaching the
end of their work lives. Sources of this divergent patterning
are then examined. Due to well-documented gender differ-
ences in work behavior throughout the life course (Moen and
Smith, 1986), only men are examined to avoid the confound-
ing effects associated with the different processes underlying
labor force decision-making among men and women. Based
on our analyses, we suggest that blurred transitions may be
strategic: the result of status maintenance efforts on the part
of many older men. These behaviors are most characteristic
of those who are approaching old age with limited economic
resources.
Late-Life Labor Supply and Transition Behavior
Labor force behavior in later life has substantial implica-
tions for economic well-being (Pampel and Hardy, 1994) as
well as for status maintenance (Calasanti and Bonanno,
1992), and earnings remain an important source of income
among those over 65 (Treas and Torrecilha, 1995). In
response to the recognized importance of labor supply for
overall well-being, a considerable volume of sociological
and economic research has accumulated in an effort to
understand the mechanisms underlying continued labor
force attachment. Some of this literature has been based on
insights offered by the life course perspective.
The life course perspective. -- Elder (1985, p. 31) iden-
tifies trajectory and transition as "central themes" in the
study of the life course. Trajectories, or pathways as they are
sometimes called, occur over an extended period of time and
are composed of a sequence of events or transitions in state.
A work trajectory, for example, is composed of a sequence
of work transitions which may include employment, unem-
ployment, and nonparticipation over adult life. Events are
interdependent throughout the life course both within and
across trajectories. Early work experiences shape work be-
havior in later life, and components of different "careers"
are linked. For example, work transitions may be linked to
changes in marital or parental roles. An essential goal of the
life course approach is to examine and understand diversity
in the character of pathways, as well as of their component
events and sequences.
Consistent with the life course approach, many research-
ers now view retirement as a process rather than a single
event or status. The status of "retiree" is not inevitable;
moreover, when entered it is not necessarily an absorbing
state. For example, Parnes and Sommers (1994) show that a
sizable minority of men work past age 70 and occasionally
S4

past age 80. Further, late-life work transitions frequently
include repeated work exits and reentry (Beck, 1985; Hay-
ward, Grady, and McLaughlin, 1988; Hayward, Hardy, and
Liu, 1994; Treas and Torrecilha, 1995) as well as episodes
of partial retirement, or shifts to part-time work. In short,
labor force withdrawal patterns in later life are substantially
more complex than previously recognized (e.g., Anderson,
Burkhauser, and Butler, 1984; Fuchs, 1982; Gustman and
Steinmeier, 1984; Honig and Hanoch, 1985; Quinn,
Burkhauser, and Myers, 1990; Ruhm, 1990). Despite this
recognition of retirement as process rather than event, the
research literature continues to focus on work-related
events, albeit increasingly examining a complex array of
outcomes beyond labor force exit.
Two elements of life course transitions have received the
most extensive attention: (a) the timing of critical events; and
(b) the extent to which linked transitions, or sequences, can
be considered orderly or disorderly in character. Studies of
the early stages of the adult life course have explored the
implications of early as opposed to late or on-time marriage,
as well as the degree to which linked transitions such as
school-leaving, marriage, and parenthood follow a predicta-
ble, normative order. With reference to late-life work behav-
ior, an interest in the timing of labor force exit or retirement
has generated a considerable body of literature documenting
the secular decline in age at retirement as well as the growing
diversity in this timing. The overall level of order in the
retirement process has received less attention, in part be-
cause a clear conceptual understanding of what currently
characterizes an "orderly" work-ending is lacking. Orderly
transitions imply that certain norms and values regarding the
timing and sequencing of linked roles underlie behavior; yet
in the case of retirement, these norms have been changing
rapidly in recent decades (Laczko, 1989; Schuller, 1989).
As an alternative conceptualization, orderly transitions may
imply some concurrence between behavior and the individ-
ual's plans or expectations. Following this logic, Ekerdt,
Vinick, and Bosse (1989) find that although a large share of
their study participants retired close to the time planned,
about one-third failed to meet their expectations (or, alterna-
tively, failed to accurately predict timing), indicating a
substantial degree of "disorder" in the retirement process.
Crisp vs blurred patterns of laborforce exit. -- Rindfuss
(1991) notes that events for which a precise time point can be
denned marking the end of all components of the first role
and the beginning of the second, such as births or deaths,
may be considered "crisp" transitions. In contrast,
"blurred" transitions are characterized by a gradual role
transition, or a period of time when the two roles are
overlapping. For example, Rindfuss suggests that many
young adults experience a transition from singlehood to
married that has been blurred by cohabitation. In the case of
late-life work behavior, a clean break from employment via
a single, final labor force exit would reflect a crisp transition.
A blurred transition is characterized by repeated labor force
exits and entrances or the combination of retirement and
work. Although a close examination of blurred transitions as
such has not yet occurred in the literature on late-life labor
force behavior, Pampel and Hardy (1994) cite the "blur-
ring" of work and retirement among those who partially
retire, and others refer to the growing "ambiguity" of late-
life labor force experience (Schuller, 1989).
Inasmuch as blurred transitions measured explicitly as
sequences or patterns of events are seldom examined, we
have little evidence regarding their significance (Rindfuss,
1991). Although Rindfuss (1991, p. 505) notes that "the
extent to which transitions are crisp or blurred probably has
important effects on subsequent stages of the life course,"
extant literature provides little direction for anticipating
these effects at any point in the life course. Abbott (1995;
Abbott and Hrycak, 1990) suggests that the antecedents of
divergent patterns also may be important, and cautions
against an exclusive emphasis on discrete and often presum-
ably "normative" transition patterns (e.g., a crisp exit to
retirement). Following this logic, we expect that an exit
embedded within a more complex pattern of change may be
different from the unidirectional, crisp exit conventionally
known as retirement, and that the antecedents of blurred
transitions may differ from those of crisp transitions.
Antecedents of a blurred transition. -- For direction in
anticipating the antecedents of blurred work transitions in
later life, we turn to the literature on status attainment and
maintenance in later life (e.g., Henretta and Campbell,
1976; Pampel and Hardy, 1994). This literature suggests that
disadvantage is reproduced throughout the life course such
that individuals with marginal economic resources at midlife
typically enter old age in similar circumstances. Rather than
becoming either leveled or exacerbated with increasing age,
status differences appear by and large to to be maintained in
later life. Pampel and Hardy (1994) note that, as in earlier
stages of the life course, labor force behavior may be an
important vehicle whereby status is negotiated in old age.
Thus, work behavior in later life may reflect underlying
inequalities among members of the older population (Cala-
santi and Bonanno, 1992; Hayward and Grady, 1990).
Following these arguments, patterns of labor force activity
in later life may be seen as extensions of behavior earlier in
the life course, as well as a response to threats to economic
well-being.
This view is consistent with a preponderance of research
evidence on late-life labor supply in general, particularly
research on low-wage populations and on reentry following
retirement. For example, in her evaluation of work behavior
among older African Americans, Gibson (1987) notes that
worker and nonworker statuses often are confounded in that
many persons report being out of the labor force yet not
retired -- a labor force category she terms the "unretired-
retired." Gibson argues that this hybrid status arises due to
several conditions common among low-wage populations,
including a lack of distinction between unstable work pat-
terns in youth and old age, and a recognition that one must
continue to work from time to time even beyond retirement
age. One behavioral outcome of being "unretired-retired" is
a sequence of work and nonwork consistent with our descrip-
tion of a "blurred" transition. Applied to lower status
populations in general, this argument clearly suggests that
"hybrid" statuses as well as "blurred" transitions may be a
result of prior work patterns and limited economic resources.
S6 MUTCHLER ET AL.
Studies focusing on transitions back into the labor force
following retirement also support this hypothesis. Calasanti
and Bonanno (1992) find that many individuals reenter the
work force in an apparent struggle to maintain their preretire-
ment status or, at least, an acceptable standard of living.
Ruhm (1990) also suggests that reentry is linked to status
maintenance, finding that those ineligible for a pension are
more likely to cycle back into the work force.
Following these insights, our primary hypothesis is that
economic resources -- specifically, lack of pension and low
level of nonwage income -- are key factors dissuading
older men from crisp exits and permanent retirement, to-
ward more blurred transition patterns. That is, limited
nonwork resources are expected to be associated with a
higher probability of experiencing a blurred labor force
exit. Our emphasis on economic and status maintenance
arguments is consistent with the bulk of the research litera-
ture suggesting that these considerations play a dominant
role in labor supply decisions among older men (e.g.,
Fields and Mitchell, 1984). An accurate assessment of this
hypothesis requires that we take into consideration addi-
tional processes shaping blurred transitions, however. In-
cluded among these alternatives are (a) the residual effects
of unstable work patterns over the life course; (b) the
obstacles to working posed by poor health; and (c) the
desire to maintain some attachment to the worker role.
As argued by Gibson (1987), repeated work transitions in
later life may be the result of similar patterns occurring
earlier in the life course. We therefore expect that low levels
of work experience earlier in life may carry over into old
age, resulting in a pattern of blurred transitions. Many
observers note the growing importance of health and disabil-
ity on work patterns (Hayward and Grady, 1990; Smith,
1985). Insofar as poor health serves as a barrier to work, it is
expected to be associated with nonwork and crisp exits as
opposed to working. Among men who feel a strong norma-
tive obligation to work, or those with only moderate disabili-
ties, health problems may result in blurred transition pat-
terns. Finally, a segment of older men, particularly those
with careers that are intrinsically satisfying, may avoid
nonwork well into the retirement years. Older men with a
strong preference for work or attachment to the work role,
proxied here by occupation (Hayward and Grady, 1990;
Hayward, Hardy, and Grady, 1989) and education (Parnes
and Sommers, 1994), may also display blurred exits from
the labor force. For these men, blurred transitions reflect the
continued lure of the work role even in the absence of signifi-
cant economic need.
A life course approach to late-life labor force behavior
suggests that several alternative pathways to labor force exit
likely occur among the older population. Inasmuch as transi-
tions in work status are costly in terms of wages, leisure,
investment, and training or other costs, it can be assumed
that most decisions will reflect fairly stable commitments to
a given status. However, as documented here, some individ-
uals display patterns of behavior that represent repeated,
short-term forays into and out of the labor force, often
accompanied by spells of unemployment. Our goal in the
ensuing analysis is to estimate the extent to which such
blurred transitions occur, and to establish key differences in
the behavioral antecedents of this patterning as opposed to
crisp transition patterns and nontransitional work statuses.
METHOD
Methodological implications of the life course approach.
-- The life course approach suggests that analytical attention
must be directed to both events and sequences or patterns.
Although some investigations have focused on sequences
per se (Hogan 1978; Moen, 1985), empirical investigations
using the life course approach frequently focus on discrete
events, some of which conform to Rindfuss's (1991) defini-
tion of a "crisp" transition and some of which are misclas-
sified as such (Abbott, 1995). For example, a common
approach in the literature on late-life work behavior involves
estimating transitions based on pairs of observations one or
two years apart, with interim statuses ignored, not observed,
or assumed to be inconsequential. More complex patterns of
change, involving multiple transitions occurring over re-
peated observations, have not been effectively summarized.
Several writers (Abbott, 1995; Mayer and Tuma, 1990;
Rindfuss, 1991) point out that the development of dynamic
techniques such as hazards models or event history models,
while providing a wealth of critical information about transi-
tions which are in fact crisp, have supported this emphasis
on events, despite the theoretical arguments focusing also on
sequences.
The practical significance of this emphasis for the problem
at hand is central to our understanding of the diversity of
transition patterns. Insofar as work transitions in later life are
of the "crisp" variety, event history-type models provide an
accurate depiction of behavior. However, for the segment of
the population that displays blurred patterns of transitions,
event history-type models may be misleading. The argument
that a labor force exit (or entry, for that matter) takes its
meaning not in isolation as a change in status, but rather
within a particular context of other exits (entries) preceding
and following that event prompts us to consider blurred
transitions as patterns rather than as isolated events. In
making this critical distinction between blurred and crisp
transitions, we are unable to make use of dynamic modeling
techniques that have been successful in the examination of
discrete events. This is the result both of the fact that
dynamic techniques for blurred transitions are not yet well
developed, and of limitations of the data set used here. The
resultant loss of information on state duration is deemed a
necessary trade-off in our effort to learn more about the
patterns anticipated here.
The data. -- We use data from the 1984 panel of the
Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP; for a
detailed description of these data, see Kasprzyk et al.,
1987). The SIPP provides national coverage, relatively large
sample size, and a wide range of relevant variables. Respon-
dent data on labor force behavior as well as demographic
characteristics, economic resources, and household and
family composition are obtained at 4-month intervals. Dur-
ing the third wave of interviews, retrospective information
on work history and contemporaneous indicators of health
are acquired; during the fourth wave of interviews, informa-
PATHWAYS TO LABOR FORCE EXIT S7
tion describing pension eligibility is recorded. The focus of
our analysis is the labor force data recorded at each of the
first eight interviews, describing behavior of the respondent
over the month prior to interview.
Our analysis focuses on White and Black men aged 55 to
74 at first interview, who report having had at least 6 months
of continuous work history at some time during their lives.
Our sample excludes men who have had a life-long disability
and/or who lack any appreciable work attachment. Age 55 is
widely regarded as the normative lower limit of the transition
to retirement period (DeViney and O'Rand, 1988), and few
men over age 74 are working or considering work. More-
over, we exclude men who are neither White nor Black due
to the small number of respondents reporting other races.
The sample is further restricted to individuals who did not
leave the sample prior to the end of the survey. Attrition rates
and patterns of premature exit in the SIPP are similar to those
in other national longitudinal surveys (Citro and Kalton,
1993).
Assessing blurred transition behavior. -- Our measure-
ment strategy is designed to distinguish among those who
display crisp versus blurred labor force transition patterns.
Contrasts are further developed with those who report no
transitions in labor force status over the observation period,
being either continuously working or nonworking. We de-
velop a categorical measure that summarizes behavior over a
period of time. As noted by Moen (1985), this focus is
consistent with the life course approach in its emphasis on
patterns of attachment and on continuities and discontinui-
ties in labor supply, as opposed to likelihood of employment
at a particular point in time. The key indicators of work
behavior assessed here include employment status and un-
employment experience. Our outcome measure identifies
meaningful transitions across these statuses and summarizes
them over eight observations in the SIPP, spanning 28
months. We first classify respondents at each observation
according to whether they are working, unemployed, or not
working during the month preceding interview. In summa-
rizing these behaviors over the eight observations, the poten-
tial for a very large and intractable number of unique re-
sponse patterns exists. In our initial examinations of the
data, we discovered that many of the theoretically possible
patterns do not emerge in the data. In addition, a substantial
share of the observed patterns reflects minor differences in
timing as opposed to sequence (e.g., exiting work in the
third as opposed to the fifth wave). The patterns reflecting
unique yet meaningful sequences are portrayed in Table 1.
Response patterns A and B reflect nontransitional statuses
and, taken together, capture the activity of about three-
quarters of the sample. Pattern A represents the group of
respondents who report working in all waves of the survey.
About a third of the weighted sample displays this pattern.
Our decision to assign individuals who report being unem-
ployed during a single wave to the continuously employed
category (Pattern A) is designed to avoid including with the
transitional groups those who report single, short-term un-
stable events (about 5.5% of Pattern A). Men who move
between full-time and part-time work over the course of the
survey, but reported no other changes in work status, are
also included in Pattern A. Pattern B includes those in a
continuous nonworking status during the survey: this pattern
captures 41 percent of the sample.
Pattern C is termed "crisp exit" because a single exit
from the labor force, representing 10 percent of the sample,
is observed. This pattern is one that researchers and lay
persons alike perceive as normative and traditional. The final
pattern (D) includes respondents who report two or more
transitions between labor force participation and nonpartici-
pation, two or more spells of unemployment, or a combina-
tion of spells of unemployment, labor force exit, and/or re-
entry, and makes up our blurred transition category. Individ-
uals observed making a single reentry to the workforce are
also included in this category. Although in preliminary
analyses reentrants were retained as a distinct response
pattern, this category included only 1.4 percent of the
sample, fewer than 50 cases, making detailed analysis inad-
visable. Moreover, logistic regression models indicate mini-
mal differences in the antecedents of reentry and other
transition patterns making up Pattern D.
Fifteen percent of the sample respondents are included in
this category; inflating the sample data to population levels,
this represents over two million men in this age group. These
results show that blurred transition patterns are common
among older men, at least as common as crisp exits. Addi-
tional analysis of the blurred category reveals that about two-
thirds reported two or more transitions in and out of the labor
force. More than half of these respondents experienced some
unemployment, and nearly 60 percent reported some part-
time work, although most were predominantly employed
full-time during their work episodes. Due to the censored
nature of these data (ending after 28 months of observation),
we cannot know how many of those reentering would subse-
quently re-exit or, indeed, how many experiencing a crisp
exit during the observation period may have subsequently re-
entered. Our "uncensored" cases (those exiting during the
second wave and reentering prior to the end of study) re-
entered about six months following exit, on average, sug-
gesting that some share of the single exit group would have
returned had the study period continued. As noted by Hay-
ward, Hardy, and Liu (1994), reentry following exit occurs
quickly, if at all. Moreover, about half of the men observed

entering the labor force during this observation period subse-
quently re-exited. Based on a description of these patterns,
and consistent with Gibson's observations, we argue that
many reentries are of short duration and represent blurred
patterns of exit rather than a recommitment to the work role.
Due to the relatively short 28-month window of observa-
tion, our estimate of the rate of blurred transitions for this
group is somewhat conservative. While it is unlikely that the
continuously nonparticipating men would reenter the
workforce, it is probable that some of the men continuously
working during our observation period will experience
blurred exits and, as noted, some share of the crisp exit
group may have been initiating or ending a blurred pattern
not observed here. These patterns are therefore not as dis-
tinct as would be afforded by a data set with a longer panel
length. However, the repeated, closely spaced observations
offered by the SIPP are essential to a test of our hypotheses,
and the conservative nature of these estimates should be kept
in mind as we discuss the results of the analysis.
Independent variables. -- The key antecedents of transi-
tion patterns examined here are the economic constraints to
nonwork posed by low levels of nonwage income and lack of
pension. We assess pension eligibility by reports of receipt
of private pension income or future eligibility for receipt if
the individual should stop working. Nonwork income is
assessed by combining all nonwage income of the respon-
dent and his spouse, if married, plus the wife's earnings, if
any are reported, for the 4 months prior to interview. In other
words, this indicator includes all income of the individual or
couple less the respondent's own earnings (see Parnes and
Sommers [1994] for a similar measurement strategy). Al-
though taking partner's income into account is essential for
providing an estimate of a person's actual standard of living,
this strategy likely overstates the standard of living among
married persons as compared to single persons. Therefore,
married persons' joint income is deflated by 0.8, yielding an
estimate of family nonwage income that takes into account
economies of scale associated with marriage as well as the
extra costs and resources of additional members. Our mea-
sure of income underestimates the nonwork income of those
respondents who are still working and not receiving transfer
income, such as pensions or Social Security, to which they
might be entitled if they were to stop working. Pames and
Sommers (1994) suggest that the extent to which this endo-
geneity is a problem may be assessed by estimating the
multivariate coefficients while excluding income from the
model. We consider this issue further in the Results section.
As noted above, likely alternatives to this effect include
(a) the residual effects of unstable work patterns over the life
course; (b) the obstacles to working posed by poor health;
and (c) the desire to maintain some attachment to the worker
role. To assess unstable work patterns we start with the self-
reported number of years during which the respondent
worked at least half of the year, the only measure of work
experience available in the SIPP. These self-reported years
of experience reflect differences in work attachment due to a
variety of factors, including educational activities and age-
graded and cohort variations in work patterns as well as gaps
or discontinuities in work attachment. Our final measure
identifies those falling into the bottom quintile of experi-
ence, adjusted for education and age. This measure is not
significantly associated with self-reported levels of retire-
ment, suggesting that it is not simply a proxy for early
withdrawal from the labor force. Moreover, pension eligibil-
ity is significantly less common among the low-experience
group, suggesting that this group is marginal in terms of
work attachments.
Health is based on respondent rating, using a 5-point scale
ranging from excellent (1) to poor (5). Self-reported health is
obtained in the third wave of the SIPP, or about one year into
the interview cycle. Some observers suggest that self-reports
of this kind reflect a desirability bias whereby those who are
not working justify this status through real or fictive reports
of poor health. Alternative measures, such as reports of bed
days or visits to health care professionals, suffer from
response biases as well (see Bound, 1991, for discussion).
We use this measure with appropriate caution.
Preference for work is a difficult concept to measure with
the best of data, and the SIPP includes no attitudinal infor-
mation that might directly assess attachment to the work
role. We proxy preferences using a combination of educa-
tional attainment and occupation. In addition to capturing
"taste" for work, education provides an indirect measure of
expected wage rate, work skills, and wealth (Parnes and
Sommers, 1994). After exploring many different transfor-
mations of educational attainment, we determined that the
best model fit was provided by a simple continuous measure
of years of formal education. For occupation, a categorical
measure contrasts those reporting professional or managerial
occupations with all others. We reason that these occupa-
tions may be more linked to one's sense of identity as well as
offering more intrinsic rewards and fewer physical demands.
We assign occupation based on our best assessment of career
job, which takes into consideration current labor force sta-
tus, pension receipt, and tenure in current or most recent job.
Several other variables have been discussed in the litera-
ture as important in conditioning labor supply decisions,
including respondent's age, self-employment status (Blau,
1987; Hurd, 1993), marital status ( Henretta and O'Rand,
1983; Henretta, O'Rand, and Chan, 1993; Szinovacz,
1989), and race (Burr et al., 1996; Hayward, Friedman, and
Chen, 1996; Welch, 1990). Age and race are assessed at first
interview. Self-employment status is based on current or
most recent job. Marital status is based on presence of a
spouse and her labor force status. In preliminary analyses,
presence of dependent children in the household was also
included in the model as a control for possible ongoing
demand for wage income (Hardy, 1982; Hausman and Wise,
1985). It is excluded in the present analysis due to lack of
contribution to statistical fit of the model.
RESULTS
We begin our analysis by exploring the association be-
tween the patterns of work behavior and age. Inasmuch as
the age dependence of labor supply is well-established
(Peracchi and Welch, 1994), the extent to which age deter-
mines the patterns of change addressed here is an important
question. Cumulative percentage distributions of these labor
force patterns by single years of age at initial interview are

displayed in Figure 1. Because the labor force patterns
depicted here summarize behavior over a 2-year period, and
age is reported at the beginning of these 2 years, this graph
indicates patterns of change by initial age. For example,
roughly 68 percent of those age 55 at initial interview
reported continuous labor force participation throughout this
2-year period. In contrast, only about 15 percent of those age
65 at first interview experienced continuous participation.
This figure shows that the majority of all age groups report
no transitions in work status, either working at all observa-
tions or reporting no work during this time period, although
the balance between participation and nonparticipation shifts
with initial age. Among the youngest respondents, nearly 80
percent are in the same labor force status across each inter-
view, about 70 percent working and 10 percent reporting no
work. Around 85 percent of the oldest members of the study
display unchanging patterns of behavior, and the vast major-
ity of these are nonworkers throughout the observation
period. The crisp exit pattern is most commonly observed
among men younger than age 65. Blurred transition patterns
are not unique to any particular age group, but are somewhat
more common for men aged 60 to 67 at first interview.
Beyond the age of 68, blurred transitions are uncommon,
indicating that labor force exit and the status of nonworker
are more permanent among the oldest men.
Table 2 includes descriptions of the bivariate associations
among the key independent variables and the four labor force
activity patterns developed for this analysis. Although these
results are not discussed here, we note that most of the
variables have statistically significant bivariate associations
with the work behavior patterns.
Multivariate results. -- To estimate our multivariate
models, we use multinomial logistic regression techniques
(Maddala, 1983). Our categorical measure of work behavior
is regressed on the key independent variables as well as the
control variables (see Table 3). Models including interac-
tions with age and with other independent variables were
tested but are not presented here due to consistently weak
contributions to model fit; relevant exceptions to this gener-
alization are discussed below.
Our primary hypothesis is that limited economic resources
outside of one's own earned income, assessed here by
pension availability and nonwage income, are associated
with blurred transitions as opposed to crisp exits and perma-
nent nonwork. Substantial support for this hypothesis is
provided in Table 3. Holding constant those measures
reflecting alternative processes that may shape blurred tran-
sitions, such as low work experience, men who report
receiving or being eligible for pension income are signifi-
cantly more likely to experience a crisp exit as opposed to a
blurred transition over the course of the observation period.
Interaction terms of pension with age (not shown) suggest
that the effect of pension eligibility declines with age. Men

with higher nonwage incomes are also significantly more
likely to be nonworkers than to experience a blurred transi-
tion pattern.
These results suggest that older men may supplement
limited nonwage income and lack of a pension by retaining
some attachment to the labor force. Individuals with limited
economic resources are significantly less likely than their
better-off counterparts to display smooth and unreversed
exits from the labor force. Phrased differently, low levels of
nonwage income appear to prompt some older men to
display continued attachments to the workforce, albeit in
sporadic patterns. The finding that nonwage income is nega-
tively associated with continuous work as opposed to blurred
transition patterns may indicate that the most economically
insecure individuals are unable to reduce their work commit-
ment, and instead work consistently without sporadic exits.
Note, however, that level of nonwork income may be parti-
ally endogenous with work status in that continuous workers
may not yet be receiving the full amount of Social Security
and pension income for which they may be eligible. We
cannot completely resolve this problem using the SIPP data.
However, excluding the income variable from the otherwise
full model yields similar results (see Parnes and Sommers
[1994] for a similar strategy). As an additional check, an
estimate of nonwork income based on income at final inter-
view is substituted for the initial estimate reported in Table
3. Results based on income at the final observation point are
similar to those reported here, with the notable exception
that nonwork income becomes positive and significant for

the crisp exit contrast, and pension eligibility loses signifi-
cance. The crisp exit group of men comprises those for
whom nonwork income estimated after labor force exit
occurs (end of survey) would be a substantially better esti-
mate of income in the absence of work. Taken together, we
are confident that economic shortfalls prompt some men to
experience multiple, short-term forays into and out of the
labor force and that this process is central to the experience
of blurred transition patterns.
PATHWAYS TO LABOR FORCE EXIT Sll
The alternative processes posed above receive mixed sup-
port. Gibson (1987) and others suggest that multiple transi-
tions in work status may simply be a reflection of work
patterns established earlier in the life course. Our evaluation
of this possibility suggests that men reporting very low levels
of work experience are significantly more likely to display
blurred transition patterns than to work continuously. Experi-
ence levels do not distinguish between crisp and blurred
transition patterns, however, and those with low experience
are less likely to display blurred transitions than to be out of
the labor force for the entire observation period. We conclude
that unstable patterns of work earlier in the life course are not
consistently associated with blurred transitions in later life.
Not surprisingly, strong health effects are evident. Poor
health appears to form a powerful barrier to working even
sporadically. Those in poorer health are significantly more
likely to report no work for the entire observation period,
and to display a crisp exit from the labor force. Although
poorer health is associated with blurred transition patterns in
contrast to continuous work, additional analysis (not re-
ported here) shows that those in the poorest health are more
likely to display a crisp exit or no work at all.
The final alternative to the economic argument is that some
men have a strong preference for work and may avoid
nonwork. Insofar as preference can be proxied by educational
level and professional or managerial occupation, we find only
limited support for this explanation. Although the coefficients
for occupation are signed in the predicted direction, none
approach statistical significance. More highly educated men
are more likely to work continuously than to display a blurred
transition pattern, but none of the other education contrasts
are significant. (In additional analyses not shown here, higher
education is also significantly associated with working con-
tinuously vs nonwork, but has no effect on the likelihood of a
crisp exit vs working continuously.)
The remainder of Table 3 includes the coefficients for the
control variables, which will be discussed only briefly. Self-
employed men are significantly less likely to report no work
and are more likely to report continuous work. In terms of
marital status, the coordination of work behavior between
spouses is observed, and an avoidance of the blurred transi-
tion pattern by men with nonworking wives. Race has no
significant effect on any contrast. Age shows a predictable
association in that men move away from work participation
as they age. The inclusion of two spline factors in the model
illustrates that, as indicated in Figure 1, blurred transitions
are particularly common among men in their early to mid-
60s. The last column in Table 3 shows that the likelihood of a
crisp versus blurred transition increases with age, flattens
between age 62 and 65, and increases again after age 65.
This suggests that the blurred patterns discussed here may be
particularly common among men who have initiated a retire-
ment process in their mid-to-late 60s.
DISCUSSION
Current literature on late-life labor force behavior docu-
ments a growing diversity in patterns of work participation
among older men. Consistent with a life course approach, this
study develops estimates of the extent to which patterns of
change in late-life work behavior represent "crisp" exits
from the work role as opposed to "blurred" pathways to
labor force exit. Our research shows that blurred transitions,
defined here as repeated transitions between nonwork, work,
and unemployment, are relatively common among older men:
among the 25 percent of the sample experiencing at least one
significant work transition event, we find that fewer than half
of the transitions are crisp exits from the labor force.
The multivariate analysis shows that many older men
experience blurred transition patterns as part of a strategy to
maintain economic status in later life. Nonwage income and
pension availability are most consistently associated with
the likelihood of displaying blurred transition patterns.
Availability of a pension appears to precipitate a crisp exit
from the work role. In contrast, those with neither a pension
nor adequate nonwage resources of other kinds retain an
attachment to the work role, albeit some on a sporadic
basis. Alternative hypotheses regarding blurred exit pat-
terns received equivocal support. Sporadic work experi-
ences in the past, assessed by a cumulative measure of
experience, are associated with blurred transition patterns
as well as nonwork, but do not distinguish between crisp
and blurred exits. Poor health is a very important part of the
model, but primarily distinguishes between those who are
not working or who display a crisp exit, and those who
retain either a continuous or sporadic attachment to the
work role. Preference for continued work, although only
assessed here using proxies of education and occupation,
appears to have little impact.
The relatively high rates of blurred exit for this sample of
older men suggest that for many men, no single event
characterizes the transition to retirement. This finding sup-
ports the call for more attention directed toward patterns of
behavior and the process of labor force exit as opposed to
cross-sectional statuses or single transitions. A core of older
individuals cycling in and out of the labor force, while
possibly meeting many needs for short-term work assign-
ments, also represents substantial turnover costs for some
organizations. The implications of this behavior for individ-
ual economic well-being, as well as for the labor force as a
whole, require continued examination.
We conclude that the high rates of blurred transitions
reported here present a challenge both to the traditional
image of the older worker, and to emerging understandings
of reentry and partial retirement. We acknowledge, how-
ever, that patterns observed in the future may represent
important variations on those reported here. The 1983/85
time period under study here followed a period of unusually
high unemployment, during which many older men may
have experienced spells of discouragement, other nonwork,
and threats to their employment that could have had residual
impacts over the subsequent few years. We anticipate that
blurred transition patterns will be increasingly common.
Herz (1995) notes that the rate of working among older
pensioners has risen consistently over the last decade, and
concludes that increasing opportunities posed by the grow-
ing service economy and increasing part-time job opportuni-
ties likely play a role in this increase. These structural
changes in the economy will be important in shaping transi-
tion patterns. Recently implemented and proposed changes
in the social security system, including the increasing age at

which full benefits may be received, penalties for early
retirement, and earnings exemption amounts will also have
an impact. Additional research examining alternative time
periods is necessary to establish the roles of macroeconomic
factors, industrial shifts, and policy innovation on the diver-
sity of pathways to labor force exit.
