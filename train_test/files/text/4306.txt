Introduction
It is clear ­ from family and epidemiological studies ­ that
hypertension arises from a complex interplay between
genetic and environmental lifestyle exposure and body
weight.1,2 Associated adiposity has been recognized to be
controlled by several genes, with a heritability ranging
from 25 to 40%.3,4
The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1)
gene polymorphism is reported to be associated with hyper-
tension, cardiovascular diseases, left ventricle hypertrophy,
myocardial infarction and diabetes.5,6 The ACE enzyme is a
chloride and zinc-dependent dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase
ubiquitously existing in mammalian species. As a bioactive
component of the renin­angiotensin system (RAS) and
kallikrein­kinin system (KKS), it plays a significant role in
blood pressure regulation. It acts by hydrolyzing angioten-
sin I into a potent vasopressor peptide ­ angiotensin II ­
and also by deactivating the vasodepressor peptide
bradykinin.7 The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of
the ACE gene was characterized by the presence or absence
of a 278-bp Alu repetitive sequence in intron 16. This
polymorphism accounts for a large proportion of serum
ACE activity, with the DD genotype having the highest and
the II genotype having the lowest ACE activity.8
Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is one of three
isoforms of nitric oxide synthase that exhibit homology of
sequence and function.9 Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized
from L-arginine by a family of three enzymes, which are
constitutive enzymes that produce low levels of basal NO
production in a calcium-dependent fashion.10,11 NO from

Abstract
Background: Hypertension has a multifactorial background based on genetic and environmental interactive factors.
Objectives:We aimed to test for the association of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS) gene polymorphisms with hypertension.
Subjects and methods: Participants included 120 Saudi patients with hypertension and 250 normal healthy controls. For all
participants, DNA was processed for characterization of ACE I/D and eNOS E298D gene polymorphisms.
Results: Hypertensive cases showed a significantly higher frequency of the ACE mutant D allele carriage (98.3% vs. 92.4%,
p = 0.028, OR = 4.8). Cases with hypertension associated with diabetes and obesity showed 100% mutant D allele
carriage. Regarding the eNOS E298D polymorphism, the frequency of the mutant D allele carriage was only observed
to be higher among cases with hypertension associated with diabetes and obesity, in comparison with controls, yet not
reaching statistical significance (41.2% vs. 34%, p > 0.05).
Conclusions: There is increased frequency of ACE and eNOS mutant allele carriage among Saudi patients affected with
hypertension, particularly if accompanied by obesity and diabetes.

the endothelium is considered an important atheroprotec-
tive mediator, as defects in generation of NO are associated
with an increase in cardiovascular risk factors.12 Multiple
gene polymorphisms related to eNOS have been reported,13
but a common polymorphism exists in nucleotide 894 G-T
that results in the conversion of glutamate to aspartate for
codon 298 (E298D). The Asp298 or D variant has been
shown to be associated with a shorter half-life of eNOS in
endothelial cell culture, as the result of increased enzymatic
cleavage.14 In addition, clinical studies have demonstrated
that vascular responsiveness is altered in subjects with this
variant, as patients with Asp298 have an increased vaso-
constrictive response to phenylephrine consistent with
decreased NOS activity;15 therefore, it has been implicated
as a risk factor for both hypertension14,16 and coronary
disease.17,18
Hypertension is a well-known prevalent disorder among
the Saudi population, especially in Qassim Region which is
a tribal region characteristically having high consanguinity
rates plus relatively high aggregation rates for familial dis-
eases such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes.19,20 In
spite of this fact, to date few data have been published con-
cerning the genetic background of Saudi subjects in terms
of their susceptibility to hypertension.
This study was planned in order to check for the associa-
tion of ACE I/D and eNOS E298D genetic polymorphisms
with hypertension among affected Saudi subjects.
Subjects and methods
As a pilot study ahead of a future wide-scale genetic analy-
sis of Saudi patients with hypertension, a convenient sam-
ple of 120 affected subjects were included in this study.
These were 80 males and 40 females with an age mean ±SD
of 50.93 ± 15.43 years. They were known to have long-
standing hypertension, i.e. with systolic blood pressure
(SBP) between 140 and 200 mmHg, or diastolic blood pres-
sure (DBP) between 90 and 120 mmHg. Their minimum
duration of hypertension is 1 year, confirmed during at least
two visits to the outpatient clinic of Buraydah Central
Hospital, Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. Of these patients,
24.1% had a positive family history of hypertension, 32.4%
had positive parental consanguinity, 12.8 % were smokers,
84.6% were obese, and 46.2% had diabetes. For compari-
son, 250 normal healthy unrelated subjects (142 males and
108 females) with an age mean and SD of 47.65 ± 11.15
years were taken from the same locality as controls.
Obesity was diagnosed on the basis of the most com-
monly used definitions, established by the World Health
Organization (WHO) in 1997 and published in 2000, that
defines the body mass index (BMI) of obesity as being 30
or greater.21 Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed on the basis of
blood sugar during fasting (12­14 h) being higher than 126
mg/dl on at least two occasions, or with symptoms of
hyperglycemia and a casual (random) plasma glucose
higher than 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l).22 Informed consent
was obtained from all participants, as well as ethical
approval from the local Ethics and Scientific Committees.
DNA extraction and amplification
The isolation of genomic DNA was done on a MagNA Pure
LCinstrument(RocheMolecularBiochemicals,Mannheim,
Germany), using the manufacturer's standard protocol.
Oligonucleotide primers and fluorescence-labeled hybridi-
zation probes were designed for amplification and
sequence-specific detection of the corresponding polymor-
phism (TIB MolBiol; Berlin, Germany). The master mix-
ture contained 2 l of a 10× mixture of Light Cycler
Fast-Start DNA master hybridization probes (Roche
Diagnostics), 5 mM MgCl2
, 1 M MTHFR primers includ-
ing 0.075 M of specific primers, and 0.2 M of hybridiza-
tion probes. Fluorescence curves were analyzed with the
LightCycler software (version 3.5.3). Automated calcula-
tion of crossing points was done by the second-derivative
maximum method. The fluorescence of each capillary was
measured at wavelengths of 640 and 705 nm (dual-color
option). Each run contained positive control, wild type
(WT), mutant type (MT), heterozygous type (HT) and one
negative control (blank reagent and water). Each result was
confirmed by the specific peak in the corresponding melt-
ing curve.
Statistical analysis
Allelic and genotypic frequencies were compared and sta-
tistically analyzed using the Fisher's exact test and odds
ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Conformity of genotype distributions with Hardy­Weinberg
(HW) equilibrium was evaluated by chi-square analysis.
For all tests, a p-value < 0.05 was considered to be statisti-
cally significant.
Results
Total cases of hypertension showed a significantly higher
frequency of mutant D allele carriage (DD and DI) of the
ACE gene (98.3% vs. 92.4%, p = 0.028), being approxi-
mately four times more prone to having hypertension (OR
= 4.8, 95% CI = 1.1­21.2). In addition, cases showed sig-
nificantly lower frequency of the wild type II genotype
(1.7 vs. 7.6%). Interestingly, cases with hypertension, dia-
betes, and obesity showed 100% mutant D allele carriage
that gave a just near-significant association (p = 0.052)
(Table 1).
Regarding the eNOS E298D polymorphism (Table 2),
the frequency of mutant eNOS D allele carriage was only
observed to be higher than controls among cases with
hypertension associated with diabetes and obesity, yet not
reaching statistical significance (41.2% vs. 34%, p = 0.34).
350 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 14(4)
All other subgroups showed a non-significant difference of
frequencies related to eNOS E298D gene polymorphism
compared with controls.
Interestingly, testing for the association of hyperten-
sion with combined genotypes of the two polymorphisms
revealed only a significant association with ACE D allele
carriage (data not shown). Comparing case subgroups in
terms of risk factors such as gender, age, smoking, con-
sanguinity and family history showed a non-significant
difference related to all studied genotypes and alleles
(Table 3).
Discussion
This study showed that Saudi patients with hypertension,
particularly when associated with obesity and diabetes, had
significantly higher frequency of the mutant ACE D allele
carriage rate than controls, with a significantly higher fre-
quency of the heterozygous polymorphism ID. Interestingly,
the ACE DD genotype frequency in Qassim region (51.7%)
was higher than reported in other Mediterranean and Asian
countries such as Egypt (48.9%),23 Turkey (27.5%),24
France (30.6%),25 Japan (29.03%)26 and Korea (25%).27 On

the other hand, hypertensive cases associated with obesity
and cases with hypertension alone showed higher frequen-
cies of the mutant D allele carriage than controls, but this
was statistically non-significant (p > 0.05).
These findings are in agreement with those of Kim, who
noted that there was a trend towards association of the ACE
I/D polymorphism with hypertension but not with obesity
among Korean women.28 Also, Park et al. found that the D
allele is associated with an increased level of ACE in
Korean hypertensive adolescents.29 Niu et al. reported that
the interactive haplotypes of genes determining the RAS,
including the ACE genes, were associated with hyperten-
sion among the Fangshan Chinese population.30 Similar
studies among different populations have provided strong
evidence for the association of the ACE I/D genotype in
hypertensive cases with type 2 diabetic subjects without
obesity, such as those done in Tunsian,31 Malaysian32 and
Chinese33 subjects. Conversely, many studies have pointed
out that DD genotypes failed to show an association with
hypertension, such as those done among Chinese,33 Punjabi
Pakistanis,34 a rural Indian population of Haryana35 and in
the western Black Sea region of Turkey.36 Similarly, no
association was found regarding the ACE I/D polymor-
phism among cases with hypertension and diabetes as
reported among Iranians,37 French,38 Japanese39 and Slovak
populations.40
It has been speculated that ACE and the components of
the RAS are expressed in adipose tissue and therefore might
be associated with obesity. Wacker et al. indicated that the
ACE I/D polymorphism may be differentially associated
with obesity depending on multiple factors.41 However,
Cooper et al. pointed out that the I/D polymorphism of the
ACE gene was associated with variation in the levels of
ACE, but inconsistently with BMI. Therefore, the investi-
gators suggested that obesity may alter the levels of ACE
and angiotensinogen, and provide a potential pathway
through which obesity leads to elevation of blood pres-
sure.42 In this respect, Kramer et al. examined the associa-
tion between obesity and 13 ACE gene polymorphisms,
including the I/D polymorphism, and found no polymor-
phism consistently over-transmitted from parents to obese
offspring among blacks living in Ibadan, Nigeria; Spanish
Town, Jamaica; and Chicago.43
Regarding the eNOS E298D polymorphism, the fre-
quency of mutant D allele carriage was only observed to be
higher in cases of hypertension associated with diabetes
and obesity as compared with controls, yet was statisti-
cally non-significant. These results do not support the
hypothesis that the E298D eNOS polymorphism contrib-
utes to the genetic susceptibility to hypertension with or
without obesity and diabetes among Saudi subjects.
Similarly, many studies have pointed out that the E298D
eNOS polymorphism failed to show an association in
hypertension among different populations, for instance, in
a population-based cohort of Caucasians,44 in Anglo-Celtic
whites,45 in Japanese46 and in Pakistani populations.47 In
addition, a meta-analysis by Zintzaras et al. has confirmed
no association of the E298D eNOS polymorphism with
either hypertension status or blood pressure levels in other
populations.48 Conversely, there are studies showing a pos-
itive association of E298D eNOS with hypertension in
Caucasians,16 Japanese,49 Koreans,50 Chinese51 and in
male Asian Indians.52 Such controversial associations
might lead us to believe that final conclusions are limited
by diverse factors challenging human geneticists involved
in multifactorial disease research. It is relevant to recog-
nize that disease prevalence is a consequence of the inter-
section of the genetic variation that represents a population
with different environmental exposures. Each population
is expected to have a different distribution of relative gen-
otype frequencies and a different constellation of possible
environmental histories.53
In this respect, to clarify the significance of this gene
polymorphism, we recommend a large-scale prospective
cohort study to more accurately judge associations of the
polymorphism with hypertension. Future research should
preferentially focus on gene­environment interactions as
well as haplotype analyses.
In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the possible
association of ACE I/D (but not the eNOS E298D) gene
polymorphism with hypertension in a Saudi population
from Qassim Region. This polymorphism can be used as
marker for the susceptibility to hypertension among
affected families, who can be counseled to avoid other
interactive environmental risk factors.
