OBJECTIVE: The contribution of genetic variants to body mass index (BMI) during adolescence across multiethnic samples is largely
unknown. We selected genetic loci associated with BMI or obesity in European-descent samples and examined them in a
multiethnic adolescent sample.
DESIGN AND SAMPLE: In 5103 European American (EA), 1748 African American (AfA), 1304 Hispanic American (HA) and 439 Asian
American (AsA) participants of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health; ages 12­21 years, 47.5% male),
we assessed the association between 41 established obesity-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with BMI using
additive genetic models, stratified by race/ethnicity, and in a pooled meta-analysis sample. We also compared the magnitude of
effect for BMI­SNP associations in EA and AfA adolescents to comparable effect estimates from 11 861 EA and AfA adults in the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (ages 45­64 years, 43.2% male).
RESULTS: Thirty-five of 41 BMI­SNP associations were directionally consistent with published studies in European populations, 18
achieved nominal significance (Po0.05; effect sizes from 0.19 to 0.71 kg mÀ 2 increase in BMI per effect allele), while 4 (FTO,
TMEM18, TFAP2B, MC4R) remained significant after Bonferroni correction (Po0.0015). Of 41 BMI­SNP associations in AfA, HA and
AsA adolescents, nine, three and five, respectively, were directionally consistent and nominally significant. In the pooled meta-
analysis, 36 of 41 effect estimates were directionally consistent and 21 of 36 were nominally significant. In EA adolescents, BMI
effect estimates were larger (Po0.05) for variants near TMEM18, PTER and MC4R and smaller for variants near MTIF3 and NRXN3
compared with EA adults.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that obesity susceptibility loci may have a comparatively stronger role during adolescence
than during adulthood, with variation across race/ethnic subpopulation.

INTRODUCTION
Adolescence is a period of high risk for weight gain1,2 Adolescent
obesity is highly predictive of adult-onset obesity and severe
obesity (body mass index (BMI) X40 kg mÀ 2), particularly in
minority populations.3­5 In the past 5 years, genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have identified nearly 40 common
genetic loci associated with BMI and obesity in European middle-
aged adults.6­9 Studies in children have replicated some of these
associations.8,10­13 Few studies examined these associations in
adolescents and fewer have compared the magnitudes of effect
during different phases of the life course. A few longitudinal
studies of specific genetic variants have shown stronger genetic
association during adolescence,14­16 and notable decline
before14,15 and following adolescence.15,16 Another study sug-
gested larger effect sizes for variants in/near TMEM18, SEC16B,
KCTD15 and BNDF in European children and adolescents
compared with adults.12
Recent GWAS in non-European ancestry populations have
identified additional loci.17­20 Targeted genotyping studies of
selected variants have been undertaken in African Americans
(AfA),20,21 Hispanic Americans (HAs),22 and several ethnically
diverse populations.23 However, these studies have been limited
in scope of variants tested and have had relatively small sample
sizes. The contribution of genetic loci for BMI on body mass during
adolescence across different ancestral populations remains largely
unknown.
To study the contributions during adolescence of BMI single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in European adult
populations, we used nationally representative data from the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health)
aged 12­21 years. First, we tested the Add Health European-
American adolescent sample for replication of published results
from adults of European descent. Second, we examined consis-
tency of directions of effect and significance in non-Hispanic

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Add Health
Participants. Add Health is a nationally representative cohort of
adolescents (1994­95, n ¼ 20 745, aged 11­20 years, mean age 15.9 years)
drawn from a probability sample of 80 US high schools and 52 US middle
schools, representative of US schools in 1994­95 with respect to region,
urban setting, school size, school type and race or ethnic background.
Wave II (1996, n ¼ 14 738, aged 12­21 years, mean age 16.5 years) included
by design Wave I adolescents still of school-age, including those currently
in high school and high school drop outs. Oversampled subgroups include
related and non-related adolescents sharing a Wave I household (n ¼ 5524
Wave I respondents living in 2639 households),24 and several race/ethnic
subpopulations, including Chinese, Cubans, Puerto Ricans and Filipinos.
Wave III (2001­2002, n ¼ 15 197, aged 18­27 years, mean age 22.3 years)
and Wave IV (2008­2009, n ¼ 15 701, aged 23­32 years, mean age 28.9
years) followed all Wave I respondents, regardless of Wave II participation.
The most recent data collection (Wave IV) included follow-up interviews
from 15 701 respondents drawn from 19 962 of the original 20 745 Wave I
respondents. Survey procedures have been described elsewhere25­27 and
were approved by the Institutional Review Board, University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Race/ethnicity. Genetic markers used to determine ancestry were
unavailable. As a proxy for ancestry, we used a race/ethnicity variable
constructed using survey data on ancestral background and family
relationship status from participants and their parents (that is, country of
origin, length of time in the US, ancestry and adoption). We use a four-
category race/ethnicity classification: EA, AfA, HA and AsA, with control
variables for subpopulation ancestry: Cuban, Puerto Rican, Central/South
American, Mexican, Other Hispanic, Chinese, Filipino and Other Asian. In
addition, we classified Hispanic and Asian individuals as non-US born (first
generation immigrants), and US born (2nd or 3rd generation immigrants),
given differences in BMI by immigrant status.28,29
Literature-based SNPs
We initially selected 68 SNPs associated with BMI and waist circumference
from the Genome-wide Investigation of ANThropometric measures (GIANT)
consortium and other studies in European adults for genotyping.6­8,30,31
We assessed redundancy using the pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD)
among these 68 SNPs within a multiethnic HapMap reference panel (CEU,
YRI and CHB populations, excluding SNPs with a pairwise r240.80),
reducing the number of SNPs to be genotyped to 42 spanning 39 loci. We
included two SNPs at three loci (near MC4R, SEC16B and SH2B1) to capture
variation in LD for Asian and African genetic structure around these loci. Of
these 42 SNPs, 38 have been associated (Po5 Â 10À 8) with BMI,6­8,11,17,19
and 4 have been associated with obesity.9
Genotyping. DNA was isolated from Wave IV saliva samples at the
Institute of Behavioral Genetics in Boulder, Colorado using the BuccalAmp
DNA extraction kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI, USA), quantified by PicoGreen
fluorescence and visualized on standard agarose gels. DNA quality was
assessed and genotyping performed at the Biospeciman Processing Core
and Mammalian Genotyping Core (University of North Carolina, Chapel
Hill) using TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and
standard protocols using the ABI Prism 7900-HT Sequence Detection
System. Genotypes were called using SDS 2.2.2. Based on 277 duplicate
sample pairs, the overall discordance rate across SNPs was 0.3%. Further
assessment of quality control was performed using PLINK 1.07. The
genotype call rate was 497.8% in each of the four race/ethnic groups. One
SNP (rs2922763) inconsistent with Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium (Po0.001)
was excluded, resulting in a 41 SNPs investigated in the analyses. Another
two SNPs were excluded in specific race/ethnic groups: rs867559 (HA) and
rs4712652 (AfA).
Outcome measure: BMI. Weight and height were measured during in-
home surveys using standardized procedures. BMI (kilograms per meter
squared) was calculated using measured height and weight assessed at
Waves II or III when participants were 12­21 years, with priority for Wave II
(n ¼ 14 646) unless the individual was only measured at Wave III (n ¼ 785).
Self-reported height and weight were substituted for those refusing
measurement and/or weighing more than the scale capacity (n ¼ 81), with
sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of the substitution.
Using age- and sex-specific International obesity task force (IOTF) centile
curves for individuals up to 18 years of age of age we classified overweight
(BMI 25.0­29.9 kg mÀ 2 equivalent) and obesity (BMI X30 kg mÀ 2 equiva-
lent),20 and the adult cut points (BMI 25.0­29.9 kg mÀ 2; BMI X30 kg mÀ 2 )
for individuals 18­21 years of age.21 As the BMI distributions within each
race/ethnic group were slightly right skewed, natural-log transformed and
inverse-normally transformed BMI were examined in sensitivity analyses,
which indicated no differences in magnitude of effects. For simplicity,
findings are reported for BMI in kg mÀ 2.
Analytic sample. Of the 20 745 Wave I respondents, 15 701 (76%) were
interviewed at Wave IV and 12 234 provided saliva with consent for
banking and use in genetic studies. DNA was successfully extracted from
12 066 samples. Successful genotypes were obtained for at least 80% of
the SNPs in 11 488 samples. Only individuals aged 12­21 years at either
Waves II or III were eligible for this study. Among the 9129 eligible
adolescents, we excluded the following participants: the twin with the
fewest genotyped loci within a monozygotic twin pair (twin zygosity
determined by matching 11 molecular genetic markers24,32 or by full
agreement of self-report measures, n ¼ 139); individuals of `other' race
(n ¼ 69), native American (n ¼ 57), pregnant (n ¼ 110) or disabled (n ¼ 47);
and those with missing data for geographic region of residence (n ¼ 67),
BMI (n ¼ 2), current smoking (n ¼ 1), or race/ethnicity (n ¼ 43). Our final
sample consisted of 8594 adolescents (5103 EA, 1748 AfA, 1304 HA and
439 AsA) with complete data (Figure 1).
Statistical analysis. BMI­SNP association tests in Add Health were
conducted using Stata software, version 12.1 (Stata Corp., College Station,
TX, USA). All analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity, and results for BMI­
SNP associations within each race/ethnic groups were combined and
analyzed using pooled meta-analyses. We assumed an additive genetic
model and used multivariable linear mixed models to regress each SNP on
BMI, adjusting for age, sex, current smoking (at least one cigarette/day for
30 days), geographic region of residence and an indicator for self-reported
(n ¼ 81) versus measured height and weight, and models for AfA included
indicator variables for oversampling based on education level. In a
sensitivity analysis, we ran all models without the participants with self-
reported heights and weights (n ¼ 81) and found no difference in the
magnitude and direction of estimated effects (see Supplementary Table 2).
Hispanic and Asian models included indicator variables for subpopulation:
Cuban, Puerto Rican, Central/South American, Mexican, other Hispanic,
Chinese, Filipino and other Asian and for immigrant status: non-US born
(first generation), and US born (2nd or 3rd generation). In all models,
sample clustering and familial relatedness were accounted for using
separate random effects for school and family. Effect estimates were
combined and meta-analyzed in METAL software using the inverse s.e.
weighted approach.33 For each SNP association, we evaluated
heterogeneity between race/ethnic groups using Cochran's Q. We
considered evidence for heterogeneity when the w2 P-value o0.10 or
I2 index 450.34,35
To assess generalization of results with published findings, we counted
the number of SNPs with consistent direction of effect relative to
published results from European populations by race/ethnicity and in
the race/ethnic pooled sample. One-tailed P-values are reported based on
a binomial draw with null expectation P ¼ 0.5 (random direction of effect
compared with published result). We defined generalization as SNPs that
were nominally significant (Po0.05) and directionally consistent with
published results.

(http://hydra.usc.edu/gxe/) and assumed additive coding, an independent

populations from 0.05 to 0.4 kg mÀ 2 (Supplementary Figures 1a­d).
Effect size comparisons
To compare the magnitude of the SNP and BMI effects in the EA Add
Health adolescents with middle-aged adults, we used data available for EA
participants of the ARIC Study. We chose the ARIC study for comparisons
despite the availability of very large comparative consortia (for example,
GIANT), as these studies present findings using inverse-normally trans-
formed BMI, which is standardized and ranked and thus cannot be back-
transformed to BMI units.36 Furthermore, the ARIC sample may be less
heterogeneous than the GIANT consortia, which recruited across Europe
and the United States, in the setting of both case­control and prospective
data collection, as well as spanning the last 50 years, during rapid changes
in the obesogenic environment. In contrast, the ARIC sample is a US
sample that was initially measured within 6 years of our own sample (1989
versus 1995­1996), thus minimizing the potential impact of cohort effects.
The other race/ethnic groups were not compared mainly because of lack of
power and potentially lower LD among these groups for the SNPs selected.
ARIC
Participants. The ARIC Study is a prospective cohort study of cardio-
vascular disease risk in four US communities.37 Between 1987 and 1989,
11 478 EA men and women aged 45­64 years were recruited from Forsyth
County, North Carolina; suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Washing-
ton County, Maryland. The ARIC Study protocol was approved by the
institutional review board of each participating university and written
informed consent was obtained.
Genetic data. ARIC participants were genotyped using the Affymetrix
Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and the IBC chip array (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). Genotypes were excluded because of call rate
o90%, MAF (minor allele frequency) o1%, Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium
deviation o10À 6, and genotype frequency different (Po10À 6) from prior
genotyped samples. Imputation to B2.5 million autosomal SNPs identified
in HapMap Phase II CEU samples was performed using MACH v1.0.16. After
filtering on SNPs with MAF X1%, call rate X95%, and Hardy­Weinberg
equilibrium-PX10À 5, 669 450 SNPs (79.5%) were used in the imputation.
For the 41 SNPs used in the current study, 30 SNPs were imputed and 11
were genotyped.
Analytic sample. Participants with genetic information were included,
n ¼ 9713. Of 9713, exclusions were made for scans from one problem plate
of unintentional duplicates (n ¼ 7), discordance between phenotypic sex
and X-chromosome analysis (n ¼ 30), race discrepancy, (n ¼ 4), genetic
outliers based on average identity by state statistics (n ¼ 16) and principal
components analysis using EIGENSTRAT (n ¼ 245), and suspected

RESULTS
The Add Health adolescents were on average 16.4 years of age
(ages 12­21 years, 47.5% male) and had a mean BMI of
23.4 kg mÀ 2 (Table 1), ranging from 22.6 kg mÀ 2 in AsA to
24.2 kg mÀ 2 in AfA. Obesity ranged from 10.9% in AsA to 17.8%
in AfA.
BMI­SNP associations
EA adolescents. In the Add Health EA adolescents, we observed
35 of 41 BMI­SNP effect estimates that were directionally
consistent with published studies in European-descent adults
(Figure 2, Table 2, and Supplementary Table 1), which is greater
than expected, n ¼ 21.5, by chance (binomial test, P ¼ 2.04E-06).
The six SNPs that were not directionally consistent included
rs2444217 (near ADCY9), rs1424233 (near MAF), rs4771122 (near
MTIF3), rs10146997 (near NRXN3), rs4929949 (near RPL27A) and
rs1077393 (near NCR3). Eighteen of the 35 directionally consistent
SNP­BMI associations achieved nominal significance (effect sizes
of 0.22­0.71 kg mÀ 2 BMI units per effect allele), four of these 18
(rs9939609 (near FTO), rs571312 (near MC4R), rs6548238 (near
TMEM18) and rs987237 (near TFAP2B)), remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction (Po0.002; effect sizes
0.46­0.70 kg mÀ 2), 17 of the 18 nominally significant SNPs were
previously reported to be associated with BMI and one (near PTER)
with obesity in European adults.
AfA, HA and AsA adolescents. We observed directionally consis-
tent effect estimates in AfA (25 SNPs), HA (30 SNPs) and AsA (24
SNPs) adolescents relative to published results from European-
descent populations, with greater than expected number of
nominally significant SNP associations in AfA (eight), marginal
significance in AsA (five), but not HA (three) based on a binomial

draw at Po0.05 (Figure 2, Table 2, and Supplementary Table 1).
Of the associations that did not generalize in the AfA, HA and AsA
populations, none had sufficient power (80%) to detect the
previously reported effect sizes. Of note, 10 SNPs were direction-
ally consistent across all four race/ethnic groups, with 9 previously
reported to be associated with BMI (Table 2, Supplementary
Table 1). Two of the BMI-associated SNPs, rs206936 (near NUDT3)
and rs13107325 (near SLC39A8), were directionally inconsistent in
AfA, HA and AsA adolescents.
Meta-analysis of BMI­SNP associations. In the weighted meta-
analyzed sample of all adolescents, 36 SNPs were directionally
consistent with the published literature for BMI and obesity; of
these, 21 were nominally significant, and 8 remained significant
after Bonferroni correction (Po0.002). (Supplementary Table 1).
Yet we had power to detect literature reported effect sizes6,7 in
only three of these SNPs, rs9939609 (near FTO), rs6548238 (near
TMEM18) and rs571312 (near MC4R). The majority of these 21 SNPs
were selected for their association with BMI, the one notable
exception being rs10508503 (near PTER), which was selected
based on association with obesity. Heterogeneity of effect
estimates (at w2 P-value o0.1 and I2 value 450) across race/
ethnic groups was observed for four of the nominally significant
SNPs (near FTO, MC4R, MCP2K5, GPRC5B).
Comparison of BMI­SNP associations in adolescents and adults. In
EA adolescents, effect estimates were compared with EA ARIC
participants (Supplementary Table 3), who were on average aged
53.4 years. ARIC adults had a mean BMI of 27.1 kg mÀ 2 with 22.5%
prevalence of obesity.
In 41 comparisons of BMI­SNP point estimates in EA Add Health
adolescents versus ARIC adults, rs6548238 (near TMEM18),
rs571312 (near MC4R) and rs10508503 (near PTER), had larger
effect sizes in adolescents than adults at Po0.05 (Supplementary
Table 4, Figure 3). Four SNPs, rs887912 (near FANCL), rs1514175
(near TNNI3K), rs713586 (near POMC) and rs9939609 (near FTO),
showed a trend (Po0.1) for larger effect sizes in adolescents
compared with adults, but none showed a trend for larger effect

DISCUSSION
Although GWAS have identified several common genetic loci
associated with BMI in European-descent, middle-aged adults6­8
the extent to which findings generalize to other lifecycle periods
and other racial/ethnic groups is just beginning to be explored.
Using ancestrally diverse, national data on adolescents, we
evaluated 41 established BMI and obesity SNPs from European-
descent adult studies to assess replication in EA adolescents, to
measure generalization across EA, AfA, HA and AsA, and to
compare effect estimates for EA adolescents to middle-aged
adults. We observed evidence for generalization across all groups,
especially in EA and AfA, which had the largest sample sizes. These
data provide evidence for larger effect sizes in both EA
adolescents compared with adults. In general, the observed
effect estimates were larger, up to 3­5 times larger, indicating a
stronger estimated effect on BMI in EA adolescents compared with
middle-aged EA adults.
Generalization in EA adolescents
We observed 35 directionally consistent associations relative to
published results in European-descent samples, of which 18
achieved nominal statistical significance (Po0.05). Only one of the
four obesity SNPs achieved nominal significance. Most GWAS SNPs
for BMI-related traits have replicated in EA adult populations.6­8,30
Other periods in the life course have not been routinely
interrogated, though studies in children have replicated findings
for several of these same loci.8,10­15,38,39
Generalization across ancestrally diverse populations
In the meta-analyzed sample, we observed 21 of 41 nominally
significant BMI­SNP associations, and 36 of 41 that were
directionally consistent with published studies. Similarity in the
genetic architecture of BMI across race-ethnic groups is of interest.
Several of the loci are thought to have a role in the central nervous
system, speficially with weight regulation. Of the 10 SNPs that
were directionally consistent across all four race/ethnic groups,
five are located near the genes NEGR1, MTCH2, SH2B1, MC4R and
TMEM18 that are highly expressed in the brain. SH2B1 is implicated
in leptin signaling,40 and disruption of MC4R and SH2B1 in mice
results in hyperphagia and obesity.41­43 NEGR1 is thought to affect
neuronal outgrowth in the developing brain.44 The SNP in NPC1
(rs1805081) is a nonsynonymous variant and may have
implications for cholesterol trafficking in the central nervous
system.45
In contrast, some findings were inconsistent across race/ethnic
strata, likely due to insufficient power but also possibly due to
differences in LD. For example, variants in FTO have been
extensively studied,11,14,22,30,38,46­48 and different SNPs have
been highlighted, with rs1861867 most strongly associated in
European-descent populations and rs8057044 in African descent
populations.38 These SNPs exhibit low LD (o0.3) with each other
in both the CEU and YRI HapMap Phase II populations and may
exhibit LD with an unidentified causal variant. We tested one FTO
variant (rs9939609) and found directional consistency with BMI in
EA (P ¼ 4.16 Â 10À 12) and HA (not significant). No effect was
detected in the AfA sample, likely because of differences in LD, nor
in the AsA sample (although other Asian studies have confirmed
the FTO­BMI association17­19 using the same SNP or one in high
LD), likely because of the very small sample size. Therefore,
additional SNPs are needed to further characterize these
associations across race/ethnicity groups.
Effect size differences in adolescents versus adults
Our observation of comparatively stronger estimated genetic
effects in adolescents than adults (Figure 3, Supplementary
Tables 4) is supported by the literature. A study of the association
between FTO and MC4R gene variants with body size in EAs from
birth to age 53 years showed evidence for variation of effects that
increased between birth and age 20, and then weakened during
adulthood.15 A study of genetic susceptibility to obesity in
European children, aged 9 years, and adolescents, aged 15
years, found effect sizes for BMI that were 1.4­2.8-fold higher in
children/adolescents compared with adults for variants in/near
TMEM18, SEC16B and KCTD15, but two-fold lower for the variant
in/near BNDF.12 A meta-analysis comparison of BMI and obesity-
related SNPs in children/adolescents versus adults in European
cohorts demonstrated a larger, though not statistically significant,
effect on BMI for five loci, including SEC16B, TMEM18, GNPDA2,
MC4R and KCTD15; our study also identified significantly larger
effect sizes for BMI in EA adolescents compared with EA adults for
the SNPs near TMEM18 and MC4R.
Variants near MTIF3 and NRXN3 had larger effect sizes in EA
adults compared with adolescents. The reasons for larger effect
sizes during adolescence are unclear, however, we note that the
adolescent MTIF3 and NRXN3 associations in EA were directionally
inconsistent and non-significant. Other possible limitations
include the relatively narrow age range marked by post-pubertal
growth and body composition changes in Add Health, whereas
the ARIC sample spanned almost 20 years (age 45­64 years), a
comparatively stable period of weight change. Cohort differences
between the two samples, such as the decade during which data

were collected, may have contributed to observed differences. The
ARIC adults matured before the obesity epidemic, whereas the
Add Health cohort matured in a comparatively more obesogenic
environment and may have experienced differential contributions
of genetic influences on weight. Over time, and with age, the
obesogenic environment may have a comparatively stronger
influence on body weight than genetic factors. Finally, the Add
Health sample is nationally representative, while the ARIC adults
originated from four communities, which may have resulted in
greater environmental homogeneity relative to Add Health. Other
differences between Add Health and ARIC, including unmeasured
environmental contexts, might influence BMI. These differences
highlight the importance of replicating our findings in age diverse
cohorts collected and analyzed with consistent sampling designs
and methodology.
While our study capitalizes on an ancestrally diverse nationally
representative cohort measured during a unique period of the
lifecycle, there are study limitations. First, the lack of adult
established obesity loci in all racial/ethnic groups is a limitation,
particularly in the HA. Second, we were underpowered to detect
effects for many of the subpopulations, particularly for the HA and
AsA adolescents. Third, there may have been important limitations
to our effect size comparisons, including contextual and sample
size differences between the Add Health and ARIC samples.
Fourth, Add Health spans the period from post-puberty through
young adulthood (only 6% of the girls had not attained menarche
at measurement). However, most of the children were post
pubertal, and therefore weight changes likely reflect changes in
fat mass, Of greater relevance, however, is the fact that recent
studies suggest pleiotropic effects for several loci associated with
menarche and BMI.49 Without knowing which phenotype was
influenced first by the genetic loci, we might diminish a true
association on BMI by adjusting for menarche, thus we did not
adjust for it.
Despite these limitations, our findings begin to fill a gap in the
literature on the high risk period between adolescence and young
adulthood and in racially/ethnically diverse samples. At the same
time, these estimates can be used in future meta-analyses in these
understudied race/ethnic groups. At present, our study is the only
of its kind in this age group. Using these unique data, we find that
many of the genetic variants known to be associated with BMI in
European-descent adults have relatively larger effects during the
adolescent period, with variation across race/ethnicity.
