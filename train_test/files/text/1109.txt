Abstract
FIELD, ALISON E., PARUL ANEJA, AND BERNARD
ROSNER. The validity of self-reported weight change
among adolescents and young adults. Obesity. 2007;15:
2357­2364.
Objective: To assess the association of weight change based
on serial self-reported vs. measured weights.
Research Methods and Procedures: Two thousand two
hundred eighty-four male and 2476 female participants in
the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health who
provided information on weight at Waves II and III and
were at least 16 years of age were studied. Linear regression
was used to assess predictors of the discrepancy between
weight change based on self-reported vs. measured weights.
Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of self-
report correctly classifying participants in terms of weight
change category.
Results: Self-reported weight was slightly lower than mea-
sured weight at Waves II and III, but weight change based
on self-reported weights underestimated true weight change
by only 2.1 (female participants) to 2.8 (male participants)
pounds. Overweight and obese female participants were
consistent in their under-reporting of their weight more than
their leaner peers; thus, the discrepancy between weight
change from Wave II to Wave III based on serial self-
reports vs. measured weights was significantly smaller
among the obese female vs. healthy-weight female partici-
pants (0.3- vs. 2.3-pound underestimation, p  0.05).
Among the male participants, the same pattern was evident.
African-American ethnicity, Hispanic ethnicity, the level of
physical activity, the hours per week watching television,
and weight change efforts were not related to the discrep-
ancy between weight change based on self-reported vs.
measured weights.
Discussion: The discrepancy between weight change based
on self-report vs. measured weights was minor and not
related to race, weight change efforts, activity, or inactivity,
thus suggesting that much of the error is random.
Key words: weight change, gender, adolescents
Introduction
Although self-reported BMI, weight change, and BMI
change have been used to predict the development of nu-
merous chronic diseases, such as type II diabetes (1,5­8),
stroke (1,9), breast cancer (4,10,11), lung cancer (12), and
hypertension (8,13), there has been some concern that self-
reports are biased estimates and that, as a result, self-
reported weight and BMI underestimate their true values.
The validity of self-reported weight and height have been
investigated in both adult populations (14­17) and adoles-
cent and young adult populations (18,19). Many of these
studies have observed a high correlation between measured
and self-reported weight (17­19). Thus, there is ample
evidence that self-reported weight and height information is
not perfect, but it is more than adequate for conducting
epidemiological research using weight or BMI as a predic-
tor of health outcomes. There is conflicting evidence about
the accuracy of classifying participants in terms of weight
status based on self-reported weight and height. In the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III
study, the use of self-reported weight and height resulted in
the correct classification of weight status in 94% of 1657
adolescents (18). In addition, in the Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Add Health),1 Goodman et al. observed
that 9.7% of youth were obese based on measured weight

and height, which was slightly greater than the 8.1% prev-
alence based on self-report. Overall, only 3.8% of the youth
were misclassified as obese using self-reported BMI (19).
However, others have observed that the prevalence of over-
weight and obesity are underestimated when self-reports are
used instead of measured weight and height (20,21). Thus,
overall, it appears that weight status based on self-report
somewhat underestimates the true prevalence. Therefore, it
is more appropriate to use self-reported height and weight as
a predictor of an outcome rather than as an estimate of
population prevalence.
Although there have been a variety of studies assessing
the validity of self-reported weight, height, and weight
status, we are unaware of studies assessing the validity of
weight change based on self-report vs. measured informa-
tion. Weight change is a predictor in many analyses of
chronic disease endpoints and is increasingly a common
outcome in studies assessing possible protective factors to
prevent obesity. Therefore, understanding the validity of
weight change is of paramount importance. To ascertain the
validity of self-reported weight change based on self-re-
ported information, we analyzed data from Add Health, a
prospective study sampled to be representative of students
in grades 7 through 12 in the United States at Wave I
(1995). The present investigation was limited to participants
who were at least 16 years of age because most of the
female participants and many of the male participants would
have achieved their peak height by that age. Investigating
changes in weight, weight status, or BMI change at earlier
ages would be complicated because the results would need
to take into account height change and accuracy of self-
reported height change, hence the decision to restrict the
sample to Add Health participants who were at least 16
years of age, among whom we could focus exclusively on
weight change.
Research Methods and Procedures
Sample
In 1994 to 1995, a sample of 20,745 students from 80
high schools and 52 middle schools in the U.S., which were
selected with unequal probability of selection, completed an
in-home questionnaire (Wave I). The Add Health study
design incorporated systematic sampling methods and im-
plicit stratification to ensure that the sample was represen-
tative of U.S. schools with respect to region of country,
urbanicity, school size, school type, and ethnicity. Approx-
imately 1 year later, 14,738 of the school-age adolescents
(including school drop-outs) completed another in-home
questionnaire and were measured and weighed (Wave II).
From April 2001 through August 2002, 15,197 of the orig-
inal Wave I participants completed an in-home interview
and were measured and weighed (Wave III).
Measures
Age, weight, and height were assessed on each of the
three waves of data collection. Race was assessed at base-
line. If participants indicated that they were of Hispanic or
Latino origin, they were coded as Hispanic regardless of
whether they indicated they were white, African-American,
Asian, Native American, or other race. Among the remain-
ing participants, those who indicated that they were black or
African-American, regardless of whether they indicated any
other race, were classified as African-American. Among the
remaining participants, those who indicated that they were
Asian, regardless of whether they also indicated that they
were Native American, other race, or white, were classified
as Asian. The remaining participants were classified as
being other race if they indicated that they were Native
American or other race. Participants were classified as white
if they indicated that they were white and no other race.
Household income and level of parental education were
assessed at Wave I. Response to the question on level of
parental education ranged from "never attended school" to
"professional training beyond a 4-year college or univer-
sity."
At Wave I, weight and height were self-reported, whereas
at Waves II and III, in addition to self-report, weights and
heights were measured. Due to the lack of measured weights
and heights at Wave I, only information from Waves II and
III were used in the analysis. We calculated BMI (weight in
kilograms/height in meters squared) at Waves II and III
using self-reported weight and height information and mea-
sured weight and height. In addition, we calculated weight,
height, and BMI change based on self-reported information
at Waves II and III. The same three variables were calcu-
lated based on measured weights and heights at Waves II
and III. In addition, discrepancy scores (self-reported
weight or weight change minus measured weight or weight
change) were calculated: discrepancy between self-reported
and measured weight at Wave II, discrepancy between
self-reported and measured weight at Wave III, discrepancy
between self-reported and measured BMI at Wave II, dis-
crepancy between self-reported and measured BMI at Wave
III, and discrepancy between self-reported and measured
weight change between Waves II and III. To assess whether
difference in accuracy of self-reported weight change varied
by weight status, measured weight and height at Wave II
were used to create indicators for being overweight or obese
based on the International Obesity Task Force cut-off points
(22), which are age- and gender-specific.
Using information on weight from Waves II and III,
participants were classified as weight maintainers, weight
gainers, or weight losers according to self-report and mea-
sured information. Two different sets of weight change
variables were created. One set, created separately for self-
reported and measured weight information, was based on
changes of at least 10 pounds. Participants who gained at
Self-Reported Weight Change, Field, Aneja, and Rosner

least 10 pounds between Waves II and III were classified as
gainers, whereas those who lost 10 pounds were classified
as weight losers. The participants who remained within 10
pounds were classified as weight maintainers. The other set
of weight change variables were based on changes of at
least 5% of their weight at Wave II. Participants who gained
at least 5% of their Wave II weight between Waves II and
III were classified as gainers, whereas those who lost 5%
were classified as weight losers. The participants who re-
mained within 5% were classified as weight maintainers.
At Wave II, weight control efforts were assessed. Partic-
ipants were asked, "Are you trying to lose weight, gain
weight, stay the same weight, or not trying to do anything
about your weight?" Using that question, participants were
classified as trying to gain, trying to lose, trying to maintain,
or not trying to do anything.
Physical activity was assessed with three questions at
Wave II: "During the past week, how many times did you
play an active sport, such as baseball, softball, basketball,
soccer, swimming, or football?", "During the past week,
how many times did you go roller-blading, roller-skating,
skate-boarding, or bicycling?", and "During the past week,
how many times did you do exercise, such as jogging,
walking, karate, jumping rope, gymnastics, or dancing?" A
summary score of the mean times per week that the partic-
ipant engaged in physical activity at Wave II was computed
from these three questions.
Physical inactivity was assessed with three questions at
Wave II: "How many hours per week do you watch televi-
sion?", "How many hours per week do you watch videos?",
and "How many hours per week do you play video or
computer games?" Because the categories are not mutually
exclusive, in the analysis, we restricted inactivity to hours
per week of television viewing. In secondary analyses, the
sum of the three inactivity items was used to estimate total
hours of inactivity.
Sample for Analysis
Participants who did not have information on race (n 
2), did not complete both Waves II and III of data collection
(n  6234), were missing self-reported or measured infor-
mation on weight or height at either wave (368 male and
643 female participants), were outliers on weight (defined
as weighing 30 or 600 pounds) or height (defined as
height  3 or 9 feet) (32 male and 10 female participants),
or BMI (defined as BMI 12 or 60; 3 male and 1 female
participants) at either wave, had lost more than 1 inch in
height between Waves II and III according to both self-
report and measured height (112 male and 156 female
participants), had lost more than 1 inch on measured but not
self-reported height (449 male and 602 female participants),
had lost more than 1 inch on self-reported but not measured
height (97 male and 145 female participants), or were out-
liers in terms of BMI change (defined as being above the
99.7th percentile) on measured (26 male and 27 female
participants) and self report (14 male and 14 female partic-
ipants) were excluded from the analysis, thus leaving 3991
male and 4138 female participants who were 12 to 21 years
of age in 1996 to 1997 (Wave II) for analysis. Most female
and many male participants would have achieved close to
their peak height by age 16, but those who grew more than
1 inch between Waves II and III were excluded from the
sample. After excluding participants younger than 16 (1707
male and 1658 female participants), 2284 male and 2476
female participants remained for analysis. There were minor
differences between the sample for analysis and the sample
excluded due to being outliers or missing data. For example,
there was a slightly lower percentage of female participants
in the sample for analysis (53%) than in the outlier (55%)
sample. The difference was smaller between the sample for
analysis and sample missing information at Wave II (52%
female participants). Household income was only slightly
higher among the sample included in the analysis (mean 
$49,300) than among those excluded (mean  $43,700)
despite the analysis sample being at least 16 years of age.
The sample for analysis was 36.9% Hispanic or African-
American, which was similar to the prevalence of 37.5% in
the sample excluded. However, the sample retained in the
analysis contained a greater proportion of Hispanics and
fewer African-Americans than the excluded sample.
Analysis
All analyses were stratified by gender and conducted with
SAS 8.2 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Although
it is strongly recommended that Add Health be analyzed
with software that takes the sample weights and clustering
into account, weights were not used in the analysis because
the focus was on internal comparisons rather than estimat-
ing population prevalence rates and measures of association
that could be extrapolated to a larger population. However,
to assess whether the results were robust, the analysis was
rerun using sample weights to account for the stratified
sampling strategy and clustering. Linear regression models
were used to assess predictors of the discrepancy between
self-reported and measured weight change (self-reported
value minus measured value). Logistic regression models
were used to assess predictors of self-reported weights
correctly classifying participants in terms of their weight
change (weight gainers, weight losers, and weight maintain-
ers). All p values are two-sided, with p  0.05 considered
statistically significant.
Results
At Wave II, according to measured anthropometry, the
mean weight among the boys was 164.0 pounds, and the
mean weight among the girls was 136.1 pounds (Table 1).
Among the boys, the mean weight according to self-report
Self-Reported Weight Change, Field, Aneja, and Rosner

was an average of 0.5 pounds higher than the mean based on
measured weight, whereas among the girls, the mean based
on self-report was 1.6 pounds lower than measured
weight. During the approximately 5-year period between
Waves II and III, 64% of the participants gained 10
pounds. Among the male participants, there was a mean
gain of 21.9 pounds, and among the female participants,
there was a mean gain of 17.5 pounds. Less than 10% of
participants lost weight, and less than one-third maintained
their weight.
At Wave III, both the male and female participants
slightly under-reported their weight. Male participants un-
der-reported their weight by an average of 2.3 pounds, and
female participants under-reported by 3.6 pounds. Due to
this slight under-reporting, weight change based on self-
reported weights at Waves II and III slightly underestimated
weight change based on measured weights, by 2.1 to 2.8
pounds among the female and male participants, respec-
tively (Table 1). There was a small gender difference in
under-reporting of weight change based on self-report vs.
measured weight (mean difference by the genders  0.6
pounds, p  0.06), and the correlation between weight
change based on self-report vs. measured weights was the
same among male and female participants (r  0.8).
Although obese female participants under-reported their
weight more than their healthy-weight female peers, they
consistently under-reported their weight. Therefore, despite
under-reporting their weight by an average of 10 to 11
pounds at Waves II and III, weight change based on self-
report was 0.3 pounds less than weight change based on
measured weights among the obese female participants (Ta-
ble 2). Similarly, overweight female participants under-
reported their weight by 3.6 pounds at Wave II and 5.8
pounds at Wave III, so weight change based on self-report
was underestimated by 2.2 pounds, which was similar to the
underestimation among underweight and healthy-weight fe-
male participants (2.3 pounds). Weight change was under-
estimated significantly less among the obese participants
compared with their healthy-weight peers (p  0.001), but
the difference in underestimation between the obese and
overweight women was not significant. The pattern was
similar among the male participants among whom weight
change was underestimated by 3.1 pounds among the
healthy-weight male participants and by 1.7 to 2.2 pounds
among the overweight and obese men (Table 2). The dis-
crepancy between weight change based on self-reported vs.
measured weights was not associated with known predictors
of weight change: being African-American (male partici-
pants,   1.0, p  0.1; female participants,   0.3, p 
0.5) or Hispanic (male participants,   0.7, p  0.3;
female participants,   0.2, p  0.7), weight change
efforts (male participants,  for trying to lose weight 
0.4, p  0.5 and  for trying to maintain weight  0.6,
p  0.3; female participants,  for trying to lose weight 
0.2, p  0.7 and  for trying to maintain weight  0.4,
p  0.4), activity level (male participants,   0.2 per
hour, p  0.2; female participants,   0.1 per hour, p 
0.6), and time spent watching television (male participants,
  0.1 per hour, p  0.3; female participants,   0.1
per hour, p  0.07). Among the female participants, but not
the male participants, age at Wave II was inversely related
to the discrepancy between weight change based on self-
report and weight change based on measured weights (i.e.,
the discrepancy was greatest for older participants). House-
hold income level was unrelated to the discrepancy between
self-reported and measured weights. However, level of pa-
rental education was positively associated with the discrep-
ancy between self-reported and measured weights among
the male participants (p  0.01) and inversely related
among the female participants (p  0.05).
True weight change was related to the discrepancy be-
tween self-report and measured weight change. Compared
with those who maintained their weight within 5% of their
weight at Wave II, weight change was significantly over-
estimated among those whose Wave III weight was at least
5% higher than their Wave II weight. In contrast, weight
change was significantly underestimated among those
whose weights decreased by at least 5% (data not shown).

The prevalence of weight maintenance was overestimated
by 3% when based on self-reported instead of measured
weights (24.7% based on self-report vs. 21.9% based on
measured weights were classified as remaining within 5%
of their weight at Wave II) (Table 3). Overall, 87% of the
weight gainers and 65% of weight maintainers were cor-
rectly classified by self-report. Twenty-three percent of the
weight maintainers were misclassified as weight gainers
when the classification was made based on self-reported
weights. When weight change status was based on remain-
ing within 10 pounds of baseline weight, 81% of the weight
gainers and 79% of the weight maintainers were correctly
classified. The weighted  statistic was similar when 5%
change [weighted   0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI),
0.55 to 0.60] or 10-pound change (weighed   0.59; 95%
CI, 0.57 to 0.62) was used to define weight change status.
Regardless of the definition of weight change (5% vs.
10-pound change), female participants were more accu-
rately classified as weight maintainers.
Accuracy of weight gain or maintenance based on self-
reported serial weights was not associated with age, activity,
inactivity, trying to lose weight, trying to gain weight, or
trying to maintain weight (Table 4). There was a suggestion
that African-American male participants were more accu-
rately classified as weight gainers than were white male
participants, whereas among the female participants, Asians
were more accurately classified than whites. In addition,
obese male participants were 2 times more likely than their
normal-weight peers to be accurately classified by self-
reported weights as weight gainers [odds ratio (OR)  2.2;
95% CI, 1.2 to 3.8] or maintainers (OR  1.9; 95% CI, 1.0
to 3.5). Among the female participants, overweight partic-
ipants were approximately two times more likely (OR 
1.9; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.2) than their normal-weight peers to be
accurately classified by self-reported weights as weight
maintainers.
Discussion
Among 4760 adolescents and young adults, we observed
that weight change based on serial self-reports of body
weight was a valid estimate of weight change based on
serial measured weights. Overall, weight change based on
self-report underestimated measured weight change by ap-
proximately 2 pounds among both men and women. The
underestimation was lowest among those who were obese or
maintained their weight within 5% of their weight at base-
line. The discrepancy between weight change based on
self-reported vs. measured weights was not related to race/
ethnicity, activity level, or time spent watching television,
three known risk factors for weight gain. Moreover, there
was no evidence that weight control behaviors were asso-
ciated with biased estimates of weight change. Taken to-
gether, these results suggest that the error in weight change
based on self-report is random and, therefore, will bias the

results of analyses assessing associations with self-reported
weight change toward the null.
Our results confirmed those of other validation studies
that have observed that overweight or obese individuals
give more biased estimates of weight than their leaner peers
(3,23­25). We found that at both Waves II and III, obese
participants under-reported their weight more than over-
weight participants, and overweight participants under-re-
ported their weight more than underweight or healthy-
weight participants. However, participants were fairly
consistent in their under-reporting; as a result, weight
change based on self-report was within 2 to 3 pounds of
weight change based on measured weights. The difference
was smallest among obese female participants, the group
who under-reported their weight the most, but in a very
consistent manner.
Classification of participants based on self-reported
weights into weight losers, gainers, and maintainers did
result in a slight underestimation of weight gainers and a
slight overestimation of weight maintainers. However, ac-
curacy of classification was not associated with African-
American or Hispanic ethnicity, physical activity level, time
spent watching television, or weight change efforts, factors
that are thought to be related to weight change. Thus, it
appears that the errors in classifying participants were ran-
dom and would lead to underestimating true associations
with weight change, rather than biasing the results upwards.
Moreover, it would be possible to use the Add Health data
to create measurement error correction models, the results
of which could be applied in analyses using self-reported
weights.
Taken together, the results suggest that self-reported
weight is not a perfect measure, but the errors in estimating
weight change are less than the errors in estimating weight
at one point in time. For large prospective studies with a
geographically diverse sample, measuring the weight and
height of participants is neither logistically nor fiscally
possible. These results suggest that using weight change
based on self-reported weights as a predictor or an outcome in
analyses should introduce very minimal measurement error.
