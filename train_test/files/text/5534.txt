When I first saw the thick red fluid of my menstrual blood, I was
not surprised and I was not afraid. I had never heard of it, I had
not been expecting it, I was twelve years old, but its appearance,
to my young mind, to my body and soul, had the force of a
destiny foretold.
--Kincaid (1996, p. 57)
Some indigenous peoples have viewed menses as a holy time
in which women remain alone for spiritual reasons, including
the receiving of visions, and in Jamaica Kincaid's (1996) The
Autobiography of My Mother, the narrator does experience an
epiphany concerning her future. Nevertheless, in an interview
about the novel, Kincaid said that, culturally, a woman's men-
ses represents a "shame[ful]" event (Garner, 1996, p. 7). In
many tribes, a woman's cycle signals her temporary exile and
categorization as untouchable. In Xuela Richardson's case,
the episodes of exile and alienation last longer. In addition, a
woman's menses indicates her initiation from childhood
into womanhood, with its rigid existence: marrying, having
children, and attending to household duties. In Autobiography,
when the narrator receives her menses, she represents a
15-year-old, first-person narrator from Dominica, who is liv-
ing in the early 20th century and faced with the aforemen-
tioned paradigms concerning women's roles. She discusses
the changes affecting her, both biologically and categorically,
because of her menses. At one point, evaluating the circum-
stances of Lise LaBatte, a defeated woman with whom she
resides, Xuela asks, "To want desperately to marry men, I
have come to see, is not a mistake women make; it is only
that, well, what is left for them to do?" (Kincaid, 1996, p. 64).
The image of a woman involved in menses, an occurrence
signaling her adulthood, represents one of separateness, and
often the narrator presents herself as a silent, solitary figure.

Isolation and Inclusion: The Modulation
of Limited and Plural Points of View in
Jamaica Kincaid's The Autobiography of My
Mother
Tara Hembrough1
Abstract
In Autobiography of My Mother, Jamaica Kincaid utilizes alternating points of view to portray the novel's overarching
narratological, spatio-temporal, and ideological concerns. Kincaid crafts her story's postmodern narrative in interesting ways
by implementing both first-person-singular and first-person-plural points of view as aging protagonist, Xuela Richardson,
reviews her life and tells her complicated, coming-of-age tale involving her ongoing struggle against colonial racism and
the oppression of women. Often, the narrator speaks alone to explore the quest she is undertaking, a journey in which
she receives little help from potential mentors in her colonial island setting, and here Kincaid relies on the singular view.
Alternately, Kincaid switches to the plural view to portray the possibility for camaraderie that Xuela pursues in alliances
with others, namely, women who might serve as potential mother figures but fail. In some instances, the protagonist speaks
together with both family and community members to present their common thoughts regarding their shared sense of
subjugation in Dominica's island setting, yet these acts of co-narration do not bring her the solace she seeks. As the narrator
contemplates her identity, one affected by her mother's death, her father's abandonment of her, her rejection by her
stepmother and stepsister, and her dismissal by teachers and classmates, Xuela attempts to tell her story both alone and with
others. Finally, however, Xuela discovers that any capacity for self-knowledge lies beyond her in an alienating world, and she
remains displaced within Dominica's culture.

Xuela finds herself alone for many reasons. Her mother is
dead, and her father, an inconstant presence, does not care
about her. The protagonist's stepmother calls her a thief and
turns her stepsiblings against her. Moreover, Xuela walks to
school with classmates who, mistrustful of one another, are
not her friends. She sleeps with a man who does not care for
her, becomes pregnant by him, and briefly carries a baby for
his wife, who has no children of her own but wishes to raise
the one she hopes Xuela will provide. As the narrator defines
herself via the first-person-limited view, she finds herself
alone in her struggle for an identity unscripted by colonial,
socioeconomic, or gendered maxims. Still, Xuela searches for
interplay with others. In various instances, she attempts to
relieve her isolation by temporarily uniting herself with mul-
tiple groups--males and females, Africans and Caucasians,
children and adults, family and community members. The
novel purports to be the narrator's mother's autobiography
but represents Xuela's own halting, fictional account of her-
self and community and reflects her "strained, equivocal rela-
tionship to language and the discursive frames it embodies"
(Simon, 2005, p. 31). Kincaid narrates her protagonist's tale
via what Kincaid presents as a mixed genre, reinforcing
Xuela's attempt to dispel the confusion and ambivalence she
experiences in rendering her identity in narrative form.
Kincaid's narrative technique underscores the narrator's
dual stratagems for expressing herself as both a private figure
and group member formulating her subjectivity. Kincaid
mostly implements the first-person-limited-view to depict the
protagonist's remote nature and at other times forays into the
first-person-plural to explore her potential for fellowship. Thus,
Kincaid prevents Xuela's first-person narrative from becoming
too limited by modulating the voice and delving into the first-
person-plural, in some instances, to illustrate the protagonist's
effort to join a collective consciousness. Kincaid's reconfigura-
tion of the limited view represents an expansion of its tradi-
tional use. Xuela, narrating her tale mostly alone, refuses to
succumb to colonial stereotypes. Her entrance into woman-
hood becomes a catalyst to developing a worldview in conflict
with the dominant schema. In undertaking a feminine quest,
Xuela describes her birth, her early removal from home, her
search for mentors beyond her home, which exerts a patriarchal
influence on her, instances of disorientation, and interactions
with and resistance to her colonial world. Through such mile-
stones, the protagonist discovers a new awareness, giving her a
voice and means to tell her own narrative rather than act as a
player in others' tales. Nevertheless, via Kincaid's point of
view, Xuela also calls attention to the manner in which spatio-
temporal and ideological considerations affect storytelling, the
nature of which remains problematic for her.1
Literature Review of Point-of-View
Concerns
Various theorists from the 20th and 21st centuries have culti-
vated or expanded point-of-view theories, especially
concerning the limited view. To plumb the ramifications of
the first-person-limited, which Kincaid foregrounds in her
novel, it is helpful to analyze Henry James's theories.
Disregarding both Romantic and utilitarian compositional
notions, James (1881/1971) insists that the fiction's purpose
is to "attempt to represent life" (p. 389). Realists represent
not only the ordinary and common but also the privately
apprehended and perceived.2 For Realists, writers must gen-
erate distinctive material utilizing narrators with singular
vantage points as opposed to revamping old myths involving
community logic and played out by stock characters.
Through the limited view, narrators disclose their motives
and portray their actions in a manner allowing readers to
draw close to them while avoiding the artificiality of an
intrusive, omniscient narratorial presence. In The Portrait of
a Lady, James (1881/1971) discusses the boundless possi-
bilities for sight via a limited view by invoking the metaphor
of a house. This "house of fiction" offers countless windows
from which one might peer. Characters gazing at the same
tree, for instance, will have "impression[s] distinct from any
other" (p. 52). Because one can conceive of multiple out-
comes for any experience, Realists viewed perception,
morality, and "truth" as relativistic and pluralistic, and James
urged writers to implement a limited view in which narrators
foregrounded their personal realities.3
Today, narrative theorists are focusing on the growing
number of perspectives that authors apply to render narra-
tors' complicated voices, Burkhard Niederhoff (2011, n.p.)
finds, including "intermediate cases, embeddings, transgres-
sions or unusual combinations" of points of view.4 More
recent theorists have also broadened discussions of perspec-
tive by foregrounding the first-person-plural view and add-
ing ideological and spatio-temporal concerns to its
conception. Wayne Booth (1961/1983) proposes that one
must account not only for narrators' positions but also for
their mental landscapes and "privilege" in accessing story
details (pp. 160-163). Similarly, Ansgar Nunning (2001)
argues that narrators' views are linked to their "psychologi-
cal idiosyncrasies, attitudes, [and] norms and values" (p.
213), as opposed to being confined to a rendering of events,
one supposedly devoid of moralizing, as it is for James
(1908/1972), believing that focalizers represent "window[s]"
and "mirror[s]," reflecting the story's action without judg-
ment (p. 249).
Like other contemporary narratologists, Susan Lanser
(1981) finds point-of-view discussions to be complicated.
For Lanser, this is because "[u]nlike such textual elements as
character, plot, or imagery, point of view is essentially a rela-
tionship [between the seer and his or her object] rather than a
concrete entity," which can be difficult to pinpoint (p. 13).
For Lanser, like Booth, a writer's gender, socioeconomic
standing, and values play a part in creating a work's perspec-
tive. Wolf Schmid also recognizes multiple components as
comprising point of view. According to Schmid, in each text,
authors render relationships among point-of-view aspects
Hembrough 3
differently, making conversations about it nebulous
(Niederhoff, 2011, n.p.). Thus, newer theorists question the
old divide between authors and narrators.
Since the Realists, rifts introduced into the limited view,
and especially the first-person-limited, allow characters to
experience potentially inclusionary instances. In some more
recent, postmodern, fictional works, first-person narrators,
telling stories, wish to unify themselves with others, despite
the impossibility for total, sustained communion, and authors
switch between first-person-limited and first-person-plural
views. This "new" type of narration through the first-person-
plural, via the pronoun "we," represents a storytelling devel-
opment, with narrators discovering that they are not the only
ones experiencing social alienation. Post­World War I, when
James was writing, and Modernism had emerged, many indi-
viduals felt separated from cultural standards. But by the
1990s, in a postmodern era, when Kincaid published
Autobiography, differentiation from communal values repre-
sented the norm. Most characters, having become outsiders
together, held an almost mythical nostalgia for the past. This
change in perspective created perforations through which a
narrator could speak with others via the first-personal-plural
in attempted agreement,5 even though utilization of the first-
person-plural has remained sparse, according to Uri Margolin
(1996), because of issues regarding narratorial authority,
because one character must speak for others and access their
thoughts.
The Novel's First-Person-Limited Point
of View
In Autobiography, Kincaid uses the first-person-limited to
illuminate the narrator's solitude, a condition that, tradition-
ally, might have allowed her to reflect upon her circum-
stances as the text's main feature. James recommends using
the first-person-limited to portray narrators' sense of isola-
tion, and in Autobiography, Kincaid implements the first-
person-limited to prompt Xuela to contemplate her own
fractured identity based on age, gender, race, and socioeco-
nomic factors. All first-person narrators are what Booth calls
"unreliable," because they cannot see beyond themselves to
render a so-called objective view of a situation as an omni-
scient or otherwise removed narrator might do (1983, n.p.).
Nonetheless, Xuela is further distinguished as being "unreli-
able" because, in some instances, such as at the novel's
beginning, she narrates from a child's point of view, while,
later, as an adult narrator, she is separated from her earlier
self due to her increasing knowledge.
Bound by colonial confines, Xuela is involved in a "psy-
chological" quest (Caton, 1996, p. 1) to discover her identity.
Kincaid writes about young protagonists exhibiting cogni-
tive awareness (Timothy, 1990) as they begin to understand
their sexuality (Kenney, 1985) and familial ties (Niesen de
Abruna, 1995). These women "gain self-awareness and a
critical understanding of their social and cultural context
through many contradictory relationships with the mother
and the Mother Country: ones of love, rejection, education,
loss, and emulation and disobedience" (Hughes, 1999, p.
14). In Autobiography, Kincaid mostly elects to utilize the
limited view to depict such struggles as part of the narrator's
own silent, incomplete, or painful communications with
mother figures, family and community members, and herself
as she ages.
Because of spatio-temporal restrictions placed on narrat-
ing one's yesteryear, Xuela, fitting Booth's guidelines for the
unreliable narrator, does not recall prior events in the same
manner each time. She likens the experience of evaluating
her memories to standing atop a hole and looking down at a
dollhouse, where, depending on how the light hits, the
scene's aspects change. The first-person-limited supposedly
allows readers to understand at least one main character inti-
mately in a way that omniscient, removed narrators might
not. However, Kincaid demonstrates that, oftentimes, a first-
person narrator's skills of critical analysis fall short: In
Autobiography, the protagonist is unable to explain herself
categorically, fragmenting any summation of her persona. In
either speaking as a child and offering a so-called authentic-
ity and simplicity in her storytelling, or communicating as an
adult with insight and purpose, Xuela cannot provide readers
with any life picture, despite Kincaid's reliance on the lim-
ited view, which Realists believed suitable for this purpose.
As a further impediment to readers' analysis of Xuela's
character, as well as to her own self-understanding, the pro-
tagonist speaks little with others, even though she can some-
times intuit their thoughts and vice versa. The book contains
no dialogue and, thus, no means by which readers might hear
and see Xuela's interactions. Instead, foregrounding a first-
person-limited view, Kincaid filters the narrative through the
protagonist's head to render the novel interior in nature.
Although Xuela often refuses to talk with others, this does
not mean that she does not have a story to tell involving
happy moments and times of emotional deprivation. Early
on, she states,
I spoke to myself because I grew to like the sound of my own
voice . . . I was lonely and wished to see people in whose faces I
could recognize something of myself. Because who was I? My
mother was dead; I had not seen my father in a long time.
(Kincaid, 1996, p. 16)
Beginning as a child, the narrator speaks to herself to for-
mulate her history, even if it is a mythical one, as are all his-
tories, and even if she is unreliable in Booth's terms, as are
all storytellers, Kincaid implies. Nevertheless, the protago-
nist is denied a positive self-concept because her supposed
mother, Xuela Claudette, is dead, her father, Alfred, is apa-
thetic toward her, and her stepfamily disdains her. Moreover,
the protagonist boasts a mixed ethnicity, being half Carib
and, thus, marginalized in a colonial setting.
4 SAGE Open
Xuela attempts to comprehend her "own subjectivity and
capacity for agency" by telling her tale in a manner that cen-
ters and uplifts her position (Sherrard, 1999, p. 127), and
Autobiography represents a "biomythography" or "a reenvi-
sioning of a life experience which reveals multi-layered his-
tories and collective memory" (p. 130). The narrator relies
on history and memory to assemble the tersely rendered sto-
ries that Alfred may have told her, colonial accounts of the
island's people she learns at school, religion-based rhetoric
and folklore, and family and community members' tales to
construct her and her community's experiences. Still, these
artifacts fail to provide Xuela with any holistic, meaningful
account. In addition, because Kincaid relies on the first-per-
son-limited, any information that the narrator amasses as a
peripheral and, thus, unreliable figure, in Booth's terms, is
influenced by her liminal location.
In narrating Autobiography, the protagonist's concern is
understanding her mother's life and Xuela's place in it. Still,
Kincaid selects a first-person-limited view that positions
Xuela as the only character to ruminate on the woman's past,
even though Kincaid might have offered other characters'
accounts of the mother to enlarge readers' comprehension.
Kincaid's book is called the narrator's mother's "autobiogra-
phy," yet, categorically, one must write one's autobiography
oneself. Although Autobiography problematizes genre clas-
sifications, writing about one's own life does allow Caribbean
autobiographers to recognize the "interculturative processes"
affecting their views of their culture, race, and gender
(Paquet, 2002, p. 4), and Sandra Paquet's claim regarding the
benefits of composing an autobiography for Caribbean writ-
ers might be extended to apply to autobiographers-as-narra-
tors, such as Xuela, too. As the girl narrates her mother's
so-called autobiography, she discusses the forces at play,
including colonialism, gender, and socioeconomic station,
involved in constructing her own identity, even if, in post-
modern terms, Kincaid's narrator questions her ability to
know or say anything.
In the novel, Xuela, narrating with an outsider's voice,
adopts a stance toward her audience that lends itself tradition-
ally to the limited view. She muses on her mother's identity,
which the narrator constructs surreptitiously, and discusses it
only via the first-person-limited view, because other charac-
ters do not share or will not admit to having experienced a
similar grief to hers concerning a parent's loss. In reconstruct-
ing her mother's past, Xuela wishes to be cognizant of her
lineage, yet she finds this outcome foreclosed. Her mother
dies when Xuela is born supposedly, and so she never knows
her, and "this loss represents a legacy of loss: in infancy her
mother was abandoned and left at the gates of a convent, and
her father was abandoned in his youth by his father" (West,
2003, p. 6). Just as Xuela's own parents, orphaned or left
behind, must have created visions of their predecessors, she
invents her mother and father. Autobiography represents an
example of how Kincaid's "fiction circles round and round
the troubled concept of motherhood, constantly replaying a
situation of loss, longing, lack, and unanswerable desire"
(Anatol, 2002, p. 938). Because Kincaid implements the first-
person-limited in instances in which the narrator discusses
her mother, Xuela asks herself the same questions concerning
her mother's identity and offers herself the identical answers,
generating little feedback about her background, except from
within her own psyche.6
Sometime after her mother's death, the protagonist goes
to live with Alfred's laundress, Ma Eunice, who also fails to
fill Xuela's mother's place. Oftentimes, African American
writers create mother figures "prominently featured in com-
plex and multiple ways" (Hirsch, 1990, p. 415), and Eunice
represents one such example, as a mother figure without the
capacity to love Xuela or any of her children. Hélène Cixous
(1976, n.p.) describes the presentient communication that a
mother and her baby engage in as ecriture feminine, and in
many societies, the female is linked with language because
women, spending time with children during their formative
years, teach them to speak. Nevertheless, one cannot locate
the paradigm of the instructive, nurturing mother figure in
Autobiography:
[T]he image of the beatific mother encouraging her children to
speak historically did not apply to women of African descent in
the Caribbean. The dominant colonial class portrayed enslaved
women as actively lascivious temptresses, fickle wives, and
apathetic mothers. These women could not reign in a domestic
haven because they were compelled to work for their masters
from sunrise to far past sundown. If their children were not sold
to another plantation, they were typically cared for by others.
(Anatol, 2002, p. 942)
Eunice, presumably a descendent of African slaves, contin-
ues her foremothers' and their masters' patterns by engaging
in domestic labor, including washing others' laundry, for lit-
tle recompense. She considers child-rearing and washing
laundry to be domestic labor tasks of an equal nature. Once
Eunice feeds and clothes the narrator, Eunice seems to
believe that she has met her responsibilities.
In Xuela's early life, Eunice represents a central figure,
but due to the distant, apathetic relationship they share,
Kincaid never implements the first-person-plural view to
ally them in thought or speech, just as the protagonist can
never co-narrate with her mother. Indeed, Xuela does not talk
to anyone until she is 4 years old and then only to ask for
Alfred, a request showing that she only attempts to commu-
nicate with those who might love her. Even when the conse-
quences are severe, such as when Eunice punishes the
narrator for refusing to apologize for breaking Eunice's plate,
Xuela remains silent, barring a verbal dialogue between
female characters. Later, when Eunice takes Xuela to school,
Kincaid utilizes first-person-plural narration to represent the
two walking together (Kincaid, 1996). Still, Kincaid does not
invoke the first-person-plural to allow the characters to chat
about the school. In light of gender and socioeconomic
norms, Eunice probably never received an education, and
Hembrough 5
neither do her children, so there is little common ground for
the females to inhabit.
Nonetheless, the education that Xuela receives provides
her with little benefit, and she does not know why she is
attending school, only to learn European values rendering
her a "subaltern" in colonial terms. As places linked to her
racial background, the narrator studies European history
without having been to Europe and gains little information
about either her island's history or Africa, "that place on the
map, the one . . . that is a configuration of shapes and shades
of yellow" (Kincaid, 1996, p. 50). Xuela is restricted by her
education, as opposed to having her life broadened by it.
In Autobiography, Kincaid is concerned with the narra-
tor's search to identify her own purposes, idiom, and world-
view, while coming to terms with an unresponsive father and
unknown mother (Garner, 1996). Xuela's mother is missing,
but Alfred does not fulfill a guiding role in his daughter's life
either, even though she assumes his intentions toward her to
be compassionate. Because Alfred, "her only living connec-
tion to her mother" (West, 2003, p. 4), allies himself with the
colonizer's patriarchal values, Xuela cannot question him
about his attitudes, which leaves little room for them to speak
together in any potential implementation of the plural view.
"Having no mother and no functional father, Kincaid's enig-
matic heroine has no link to the past and no road to the
future" (p. 4). Unable to formulate cause and effect relation-
ships concerning her existence, the narrator does not grasp
why Alfred leaves her with Eunice.
Later, when Afred believes that a male classmate has
inflicted a wound upon his daughter and that she is defending
the boy by hiding his name, Alfred sends her to Roseau to
live with the family of a business associate, the childless
LaBattes, and she is barred again from interpreting his pur-
poses, which remain unspoken but resemble a financial
transaction. Prevented from accessing her father's mind-set,
Xuela, narrating via Kincaid's limited view, contends that
she has never comprehended what Alfred "wanted" from her,
even though she herself, refusing to explain her injury, also
prevents conversation (Kincaid, 1996, p. 62). In this instance
of the novel's concerns regarding characters' refusal to
speak, Alfred's countenance represents a "mask" that Xuela
finds impossible to read (p. 39). She believes that the mask
that Alfred wears and the jailer's suit that he dons come to
represent his true self, if such a thing as a "self" exists, a
question Kincaid poses. Alfred "has adopted the colonizer's
tastes, his language, his religion, and his values" (Adams,
2006, p. 8), and the father figure in Kincaid's work "is a man
outside the woman's world" (Dutton, 1989, p. 2), someone
incomprehensible to the narrator, even as she herself dons
costumes to "become" a schoolgirl, upper class housewife,
and day laborer in the novel.
Although Kincaid mostly renders Autobiography via the
first-person-limited, in a few scenes involving father and
daughter, Kincaid expands Xuela's purview, and the narra-
tor uses the pronoun "we" to describe their shared actions,
even if she and Alfred do not co-narrate through the first-
person-plural. The first example occurs when Xuela, as a
young child, writes letters to Alfred that she meant for her
mother but never planned to send, which her teacher mails
nonetheless. In this scene, the protagonist uses "we" to nar-
rate her and Alfred's journey back to his home and her new
existence after he rescues her from Eunice's house and the
school. Xuela's reference to her father and herself as "we,"
on the journey to his house, implies that momentarily, she
hopes to connect with Alfred and that, as with Eunice, walk-
ing her to school, the open road represents the only place
that this sense of unity may be forged. Pursuing her quest
journey, the protagonist is not confined in anyone else's
house at the moment, and if this were a typical plot, she
might travel forward into a time where traditional roles no
longer persist. In Autobiography, however, as with the walk
Xuela and Eunice undertake, Kincaid neglects to move from
the first-person-limited to the first-person-plural because in
their colonial setting, the narrator does not perceive her
father's abode as hers, and Alfred's breath "was not the
breath of [her] life" (Kincaid, 1996, p. 24).
Only once in the novel does Xuela attempt to reach out to
Alfred by utilizing the pronoun "we" in her speech.
Nonetheless, Kincaid retains the limited view here, as the
narrator discovers that Alfred's household offers a sense of
animosity. Xuela comments on the "hatred and isolation in
which we all lived" (p. 50), states of being that cause her to
want to leave his residence. Afterward, Alfred sends his
daughter to live with the LaBattes so that she can become a
schoolteacher. As in other instances, the characters do not to
speak in common here, blocking any possibility for shared
verbal discourse. Having developed a sense of "detachment"
(Oczkowicz, 1996, p. 2) from their community and finding
themselves located on the periphery, Kincaid's protagonists
often evaluate other characters' mental states while going
unnoticed themselves (Simmons, 1998, p. 5), as in these pas-
sages concerning Xuela's observations about her father.
In a later instance of Kincaid's reliance on the limited
view, Alfred, via a hired man, sends the narrator a letter,
requesting her to return home from her construction job,
which she took after leaving the LaBattes, and she rejects the
formal language and format her father chooses to compose it.
In response to Xuela's inclusion of Alfred in a shared world-
view, he refuses to register the sense of sequestration that she
describes, or else, in the book's postmodern fashion, the
veneer and the "real" have become one and the same for him.
Throughout the novel, the protagonist has maintained limited
contact with her father. Still, she hoped at various points that
he would love and reveal himself to her. However, Alfred
dies as an old man without the duo having connected.
Although Xuela has reached middle age now, she describes
herself as an orphan. She has lost all opportunities for speak-
ing together with blood family members via Kincaid's plural
view. Nonetheless, within the novel's course, speaking in
unison with a favorable outcome was impossible anyway.
6 SAGE Open
Although Xuela does not experience any belonging with
her biological family, her connection with her stepfamily is
worse, and she remains at cross purposes with members. To
show her separation, the narrator refers to her father's new
wife, another of the novel's failed mother figures, as "the
woman who was not . . . [her] mother" (p. 52). In turn,
Xuela's stepmother claims that the girl represents a thief,
who would steal away the stepchildren's "inheritance" (p.
52), although what legacy that signifies is unknown, because
Alfred demonstrates little affinity for any of the children,
even his son, who mimics him. The stepmother, who Xuela
terms, with remove, as her "father's wife" (p. 32), hates her
in a manner incomprehensible to the narrator and tries to kill
her with a poison-laden necklace. The stepmother, who also
values her son more highly than her blood daughter, ignores
any supposed bonds between women altogether, seeking to
end them, even by death, which would block any dialogue
between stepmother and stepdaughter forever.
At only two points does Kincaid open the narrative to
include the stepmother's possible point of view in conjunction
with Xuela's to allow them to co-narrate, but the result is not
positive regarding their ability to commiserate. One is when
the stepmother, out of duty, teaches Xuela to wash herself, and
the girl utilizes the pronoun "we" to contend that "[w]e would
never love each other" (p. 33). By depicting the women's
shared hatred via the plural view, Kincaid represents them as
dueling antagonists, as much as victims of their milieu, and
limits the amount of sympathy readers might demonstrate for
Xuela as protagonist. She and her stepmother face and often
promote common strictures regarding their gender, race, and
socioeconomic status, which they might discuss otherwise,
because these schemas render them, as women, abject in a
patriarchal regime. Yet, as Xuela claims generally, "To people
like us, despising anything that was most like ourselves was
almost a law of nature" (p. 52). Such scorn as her community
members identify for themselves takes the force of nature's
law, but their mutually felt emotion is generated by colonial
attitudes about race, class, and gender.
Daily, the stepmother, like other characters that fore-
ground their negative interactions, while leaving opportuni-
ties for caring or even ambivalent speech unexplored, tells
her own daughter that she does not love her. For this reason,
Xuela feels sorry for her stepsister, even if the narrator dubs
her "my father's daughter." Still, in portraying the stepsis-
ters' relationship, Kincaid rejects the potential of applying a
plural view to allow them to cospeak about the pain they
have experienced through a lack of parenting. In fact, Xuela
is unable to cospeak in any sustained, mutually beneficial
way with any female character in Autobiography. Instead,
narrating through Kincaid's limited view, the protagonist dif-
ferentiates herself from the girl by commenting on her own
so-called superior position: Xuela does not have to cope with
the same type of betrayal her stepsister faces because the nar-
rator's mother is dead, a situation preventing any discourse
between mother and daughter, for better or worse.
In discussing constructions of perspective, James
(1881/1971) paints an instance of a character's failure to
identify with others that is similar to the one Xuela encoun-
ters with her stepfamily. In James's scenario, the characters
gaze upon the same scene, just as Kincaid's characters look
at Dominica's common scenery. James describes cohorts,
who together watch "the same show, but one seeing more
where the other sees less, one seeing black where the other
sees white, one seeing big where the other sees small" (p. 7).
Although the watchers study the same scene via the same
medium, the panes of glass through which they peer differ
enough for their interpretations of it to be radically opposed.
Likewise, in Autobiography, the stepmother, her daughter,
and Xuela all represent women trapped in a marginalized set-
ting, but they cannot empathize in speech regarding their
shared plight.
While Kincaid implements the limited view to illustrate
the opposition Xuela faces in her relationships with family
and community members and her ongoing sense of alien-
ation from the world, Kincaid also chooses the limited to
depict the isolation that the protagonist intuits is connected to
her life stages, particularly puberty. Xuela finds it difficult to
describe her "changing self" (Kincaid, 1996, p. 58), because,
temporally, she cannot apply any understanding she has of
the past to present circumstances. The narrator's lack of per-
ceived connection between events places her in a state of
limbo--outside childhood's bounds but not inside those of
adulthood. In the novel's beginning, Xuela neither possesses
any aspirations, nor is she presented with any real choices
when she arrives at the LaBatte household, where she
becomes a concubine, to fulfill the couple's wishes, and
schoolgirl, to meet her father's desires. In reaction to these
imposed circumstances, she states, "I did not object, I could
not object, I did not want to object; I did not know how to
object openly" (p. 63). Without options or the possibility of
making decisions, the protagonist, having no voice and no
champion, narrates from Kincaid's limited view. Just as
Xuela has obeyed her father, stepmother, and Eunice, the
narrator never thinks of refusing Lise anything, even being
dispatched as a "gift" to her husband (p. 68). Still, Xuela
never considers herself part of the LaBatte family and, thus,
included in a larger community either. This social rejection
on her part lends itself to Kincaid's imposition of the limited
view in portraying the narrator's continuing sense of
estrangement.
During the day, Xuela attends school, where she remains
quiet because she is female, and at night, she has sexual rela-
tions with Jacques LaBatte, where she is also silent as he puts
his hand over her mouth, and she realizes that her life is in "a
state of upheaval" (p. 73). However, no one wants to hear the
protagonist narrate her story, which is why Kincaid maintains it
in the limited view here. Xuela has no one in whom to confide
or to act as a model for her. She must act both as a child and
woman, and Kincaid relies on the limited view to depict her as
a character with both public and private personas, guises that
Hembrough 7
the protagonist discovers do not coincide with each other.After
losing her virginity, she states, "I was not the same person that
I had been before" (p. 71) and expresses a schism in her self-
concerned with both her changing physicality and experience.
This split makes rendering any "clear," continuous account of
herself difficult, perhaps enough so to prohibit Xuela from
entering into conversations with others via a plural view for
their possible affirmation of her figure in these passages.
As her adult sensibilities emerge, the protagonist decides,
without informing anyone, that she will not follow Lise's
plan involving Xuela's having a baby by Jacques. For the
narrator, having maintained an interior personality via
Kincaid's mostly limited-view narration, this resolve is sim-
ple. A schoolgirl prevented from having a voice, Xuela keeps
her opinions to herself, even as her current mother figure,
Lise, expects her to assume a surrogate's role in birthing a
baby instead of allowing Xuela to be a child. Kincaid writes
in a style that is "spare" and "deceptively simple" (Garner,
1996, pp. 1-2), and this style seems appropriate, especially in
scenes in which Kincaid describes Xuela's adolescent state,
about which she possesses an imperfect understanding. Via
Kincaid's limited view, the protagonist is occupied in narrat-
ing complicated options for herself, even if her evaluation of
them seems opaque in complementing her youthful reason-
ing. It is not until Xuela becomes pregnant, undergoes an
abortion, and faces the possibility of death that she declares,
"I believed then that I would die, and perhaps because I no
longer had a future I began to want one very much" (Kincaid,
1996, p. 82). Here, Kincaid utilizes the limited view to depict
the narrator making resolutions for herself and by herself for
a future in which she remains alone, never locating the com-
munity she seeks. Indeed, it is possible that Xuela becomes
the mother of a daughter never introduced in the book.
Because Kincaid stays in the limited view for the novel's
greater part, Xuela's confusion in navigating her experiences
is heightened. When she first arrives in Roseau, all seems new
and exciting, yet soon, her feelings of glee wane. The pro-
tagonist faces a spatio-temporal divide in narrating her life
circumstances: She has left behind the familiar map of places,
people, and events for shocking ones that leave her some-
times wiser but often numb. Xuela states, "I long now to feel
fresh again, to feel I will never die, but that is not possible. I
can only long for it; I can never be that way again" (p. 62).
Because of the time and space divide, she finds it difficult to
narrate her history, even if she believes it represents one that
women in her community share and, as Kincaid implies,
should have a language for disseminating.As Xuela grows, so
does her world outlook. Nonetheless, because of Kincaid's
limited view, the narrator keeps her revelations to herself, as
do the other voiceless women in their colonial society.
In addition to being set apart from those in her culture for
numerous reasons, Xuela is also inhibited from claiming a
voice and gaining possible self-agency because of her socio-
economic status, a factor pushing her toward her society's
periphery and making the limited view appropriate for her
response. In Eunice's as well as Alfred's houses, and then in
the LaBatte's abode, the girl represents little more than a ser-
vant and perceives her life as being "small and limited" (p.
59), a situation blocking her ability to narrate greater self-
possibilities. At the mission school, she has learned that her
colonial milieu was constructed based on a "history of peo-
ples" with whom she would never interact, namely,
Caucasians (p. 199), and Xuela's ideological and temporal
sense of remove from the subjects she has studied impairs
her potential to narrate from a place in which she might fea-
ture herself in a prominent, valued way within the dominant
paradigms.
Interestingly, in an interview, Kincaid revealed that as a
child, she was also made aware that she should strive to
reach her potential, but her teachers and parents utilized
English standards as success's measurement, and she was not
English (Pupello, 2012, n.p.). In Autobiography, Dominica's
European-based ideology influences Xuela to "feel humili-
ated, humbled, small" (Kincaid, 1996, p. 59), although it is
the people of African descent themselves, including Alfred,
who help to reinforce such continuing values and limit the
options for narratives that can be spun and spoken together
via a plural view.
Feeling confined by local precedents, as well as by the
spaces in which she resides, the narrator argues that Roseau
cannot be "called" a true city given to trade and the intermin-
gling of ideas, a capitol in which "plots are hatched and the
destinies of many are determined"; instead, it represents an
"outpost" (p. 61). Moreover, the countryside also signifies a
"false paradise" that is "beautiful, ugly, humble and proud;
full of life, full of death" (p. 32). Describing the locations
where she is given shelter by different families, Xuela feels
restricted and shaped by her landscape and the shifting lan-
guage available to depict it, and throughout the novel, she
wonders how she can construct an open destiny for herself,
because her locations predetermine it. As with Eunice's bro-
ken plate depicting an English countryside labeled "heaven,"
the protagonist discovers that there is no utopia to be attained,
and that any narrative she creates for herself is either limited
by her gender, socioeconomic status, and race, or is false.
At last, when Xuela finds that she has been unable to
ascertain her identity or life purpose, Kincaid implies in the
novel that with language's failure to signify, all narratives
that the characters render are false, leading to a collapse in
meaning for any narrator or narrators speaking from either a
limited or plural view. By the end, spatially, attempting to
narrate her parents' stories, the protagonist discovers that
what she does not know is like a sea swallowing her (Kincaid,
1996). Similar to the "black room" of history that she per-
ceives as an empty space for those of her culture and race (p.
3), this sea, no different from her island's mountains and
coastlines, represents a desolate, unnavigable landscape
yielding no knowledge to depict.
Because of her early life circumstances, Xuela decides not
to bear children, another context for which Kincaid might
8 SAGE Open
have implemented a first-person-plural view through which
the protagonist could have discussed her and her children's
commonalities, because she "understands that she will never
possess the self-knowledge, connectedness, or inheritances
that parents impart to their children" (West, 2003, p. 7).
Xuela, unable to narrate her past, cannot foresee her future,
especially one involving children. The loss of her mother "has
paralyzed Xuela with the notion that if she should have a
child," the result would be ruinous (Morris, 2002, p. 966).
Besides Lise, no one in the novel demonstrates a definite love
for Xuela, one she believes she must experience to return.
In literature representingAfricanAmerican and Caribbean
women, the mother usually holds the place "of the matri-
arch--a nurturing, long suffering caregiver for whom sacri-
fice is second nature and without whom the child's identity
formation is either traumatized or unforgivably altered"
(Sherrard, 1999, p. 126), and in Autobiography, Xuela, hav-
ing no mother figure assuming a nurturer's role, remains
traumatized. The narrator's rejection "of motherhood is ulti-
mately a refusal of meaning, specifically a refusal of meta-
phor" (Cobham, 2002, p. 869), and in the book, as much as is
possible in postmodern terms, Xuela defines her own land-
scape through Kincaid's limited view to prevent others from
imposing the identity of motherhood upon her, even if she
remains haunted by it.
After committing an abortion and deciding not to become
a mother, the acceptable role for a person of her gender, race,
and status, Xuela retreats to live alone in a hut. There, she
continues to tell her tale while totally removed from others.
Speaking from this minimalized location, the narrator
expounds on why she does not want to be a mother, school-
girl, mistress, or housemaid. She does not want to suffer
silently the fate of women, such as her old friend, who walks
by silently without speaking and has aged dramatically. The
linking of the "postcolonial with woman . . . almost inevita-
bly leads to the simplicities that underlie unthinking celebra-
tions of oppression, elevating the racially female voice into a
metaphor for the `good'" (Suleri, 1995, p. 273), and through-
out the novel, Xuela problematizes the metaphor of the cel-
ebrated mother by depicting how women's available roles
lead to their demoralization.
Abiding in the hut, the girl positions herself as an exile
and outcast by rejecting women's venues, either saintly or
evil as constructed in colonial terms, and taking on the
appearance and labor of a man by purchasing a dead man's
clothes, cutting her hair, and working on a construction site.
Still, living alone as if in a tomb and digging and filling the
same holes at the site, she identifies herself as "not a man,
not a woman, not anything" (Kincaid, 1996, p. 102).
Although Xuela, earning an income for the first time,
expresses a sense of independence as a wage earner, she
finds that the day laborer's existence is not any superior to
prior positions she has held. Rejecting roles associated with
her race for both genders, the protagonist becomes a zombie,
not dead but not alive to any purpose either, certainly not one
of bringing a baby into the world, which someone must
mother and teach to narrate its own tale.
As a result of Xuela's campaign for independence, or per-
haps because all people are alone in postmodern terms, as
Kincaid implies, the girl forms no close relationships, a con-
text leading Kincaid to remain mostly in the limited view for
the novel's course. Later in life, Xuela marries Philip, a
Caucasian doctor resembling her father, a conqueror impos-
ing his mark on the landscape, but, as Kincaid suggests, as
much a pawn of his environment as anyone else. Despite the
narrator's marriage, a sacred bond fusing two people, she
experiences no unity with either Caucasians or males, just as
she has been unable to find female companionship. Once,
Xuela and Philip may cospeak via the first-person-plural
view, or she may be speaking for both of them simply, when,
marrying, they explain that "we were very serious" about
their vows, and that their "union was so palpable, so certain,
we could almost feel it with our hands" (p. 214). Still, despite
the moments in which they share an allied front on their wed-
ding day, Xuela remains separated emotionally from her hus-
band until his death (as well as afterward).
Meanwhile, the narrator does not form any relationships
with those of aboriginal descent either, because the Caribs,
her mother's people with whom she would have liked to have
associated, or so she thinks, have been decimated. The pro-
tagonist identifies her lover, Roland, a poor stevedore, as the
only person about whom she has ever cared but finds that her
liaison with him is fleeting, too. Xuela implements the pro-
noun "we" to describe a time with Roland in which "we were
happy" (p. 166), but readers do not learn much about the
couple's hopes, probably because the two possess no future
to co-narrate, as he is married. Although engaged in a quest,
she "find[s] no community to provide her a meaningful sense
of place and self--the self she ultimately constructs is
defined by loss and isolation" (West, 2003, p. 3). Kincaid
relies on the limited view to render Xuela a solitary being,
discovering that she cannot identify with family members,
women, or even potential children. Interactions with men
and romantic partners of both African and Caucasian descent
fail to provide camaraderie, too.
The Novel's First-Person-Plural Point
of View
Considering her protagonists, Kincaid deemed Xuela "more
godlike" than other heroes she constructed previously
(Ferguson, 1994, p. 187). Consequently, Kincaid's reliance
on the first-person-limited to render the novel in Xuela's
voice, language, and ideological framework seems fitting.
Nevertheless, in various sustained instances, Kincaid keeps
Autobiography from becoming too narrow by interjecting
the first-person-plural as Xuela co-narrates with others,
namely, children and women, sharing her context, even if
they do not forge a collective consciousness. Kincaid's use of
the plural view allows the narrator to reach out to others and
Hembrough 9
attempt to include them in her speech acts, even if these acts
do not provide her with the community she requires.
In the first example of Kincaid's application of the first-
person-plural, as a child, Xuela is united in sentiment and
purpose with her classmates as they walk to school during
the time before Alfred sends her to Roseau. The students'
relationship is not characterized by friendship, however, but
by mistrust and fear. Feeling part of a larger whole represent-
ing the island's native inhabitants, but barred from exploring
any commonalities, the girl states of the group, "We were
never to trust one another . . . [even though] these people
were ourselves, . . . [who] shared a common history of suffer-
ing and humiliation and enslavement and genocide" (Kincaid,
1996, pp. 47-48). Although Xuela and her classmates are at
least partially of African descent, and many of their ancestors
were enslaved, killed, or otherwise exterminated, the class-
mates believe that they do not possess any bond. Their par-
ents, who do not speak in common in the novel either,
reinforce this sentiment of mutual mistrust by telling them
not to befriend one another.
In discussing Xuela's and her classmates' experiences
with their teacher, an African woman, who despises her own
racial and cultural heritage and teaches students to do the
same, Kincaid once again implements the plural view to por-
tray the students' collective assessment of the woman, one
based similarly on a mistrust of someone of their race and
standing. Nevertheless, in this passage, Kincaid also includes
the teacher's voice within the first-person-plural viewpoint
to reveal that the teacher and students hold reciprocating
beliefs concerning their relationship's nature. Full of self-
loathing for her background, the teacher, according to the
girl, "did not love us; we [Xuela and the students] did not
love her; we [the teacher, Xuela, and the students] did not
love one another" (p. 15).
The teacher and children are united in disregard for one
another, yet their strategy for shared representation separates
them and prevents constructive dialogue. Although Xuela's
"story is intensely private, avoiding mention of the island's
political affairs in favor of her thoughts and relationships, it
is imbrued with the history of colonialism and slavery"
(Schultheis, 2001, n.p.), and in this scene, the "facts" of their
collective history, which the narrator and her community
avoid discussing, continue to affect the students' relation-
ships with one another and their teacher. Despite Kincaid's
plural view, no one talks openly and jointly about the island's
history, a situation reinforcing a pattern of the inhabitants'
oppression through their inexpression of themselves.
Within this same time frame, Kincaid utilizes the first-
person-plural to depict Xuela and the children united again in
communicating a tale involving an apparition representing a
nude, dark-skinned female, who, singing, draws one boy to
swim to her in the river and drown. The children's story, told
by numerous witnesses among them, including the narrator,
to both group members and their parents, is rejected by the
adults, who consider their offspring untrustworthy and abject
because of their sharing of mythical tales, with elements fea-
tured in native culture. Later, the children, excepting Xuela,
dismiss the narrative, too, having absorbed the doubt that
their parents exhibit for stories refuting European values and
"truths." Concerning the children's failure to speak and be
heard, despite their having presented a shared outlook via the
first-person-plural view, she states,
Everything about us is held in doubt and we the defeated define
all that is unreal, all that is not human, all that is without love, all
that is without mercy. Our experience cannot be interpreted by
us; we do not know the truth of it. (Kincaid, 1996, p. 37)
Having had their claims denied by their parents, who pro-
hibit the children, including Xuela, from relating the drown-
ing episode again, the children fail to identify and, thus,
comprehend the horror they have witnessed in their friend's
disappearance, and all but the narrator discredit the event, a
result rupturing their collective account. "Caribbean people,
whose lived experience is framed by African-derived ways
of seeing the world, often will disavow their own praxis to
outsiders and to themselves" (Cobham, 2002, p. 869), and in
Autobiography, Kincaid demonstrates how, through the van-
ishing boy's example, in the future, the children's stories
may continue to separate them instead of unit them, despite
Kincaid's plural view here. By blocking speech concerning a
missing community member, the townspeople prohibit his
story's sharing and, thus, its remembrance.
While Kincaid implements the first-person-plural so that
Xuela may attempt to speak with her schoolmates by using a
set of shared colonial values, Kincaid also applies the plural
view in passages involving women, who, like the children,
suffer a similar social subjection in the book. The greatest
example occurs when the protagonist is sharing her days
with Lise, with whom Xuela communicates silently, and who
she understands in a way that she never does with anyone
again. One day, Lise, imparting her life story, teaches the girl
to make coffee for Jacques, with whom Xuela is having sex-
ual relations, and the narrator states,
When we were alone we spoke to each other in French patois,
the language of the captive, the illegitimate; we never spoke of
what we were doing and we never spoke for long; we spoke of
the things in front of us and then we were silent. (Kincaid, 1996,
p. 74)
Lise and Xuela speak alone but together in this passage,
where their words are not captured, and they talk not of
larger socioeconomic circumstances, identities, or ideolo-
gies, as women who could assist each other might, but of
casual topics, perhaps ones not worth exploring to their colo-
nial society at all and, thus, not included in the narrative.
Although the protagonist and Lise never openly discuss the
situation involving their sharing of a man, this passage repre-
sents an instance in which the women, having a common rep-
resentation in their milieu as captives and illegitimate people,
10 SAGE Open
exchange ideas, however slight, as Kincaid foregrounds their
expressions via a plural view.
Later, Xuela and Lise also communicate nonverbally, and
Kincaid implements the plural view again to depict this
exchange, one that their society might not have thought wor-
thy for them to render verbally either. The girl and Lise ana-
lyze each other as friends, contenders, and mother and
daughter, silently, stating, "We sat on two chairs, not facing
each other, speaking without words, exchanging thoughts" (p.
75).Although the novel's focus remains on Xuela throughout,
both women take the spotlight in these instances of shared
conversation narrated through Kincaid's plural view.
A third time in which Kincaid implements the plural view
is to include not only the narrator and Lise but also Jacques in
the narration's collective rendering. Here, all three are
involved in a love triangle about which none speaks verbally
to the group. Underlying tension is created when Xuela
explains that Lise listens to the girl and Jacques having sex
but never mentions the encounters, and neither does anyone
else. With feigned ignorance and even joyful acceptance of
their shared position, Xuela states that, in this scene, they all
know that the rain is falling outside the house, but that "we
never heard it" (p. 76). In this passage, narrated via Kincaid's
plural view, the characters signal that no collective communi-
cation concerning their liaisons occurs, not even in a manner
allowing the mention of something as trivial as the weather.
By refusing to speak and skirting chance meetings in the
same room, the housemates avoid a direct confrontation con-
cerning their tryst, one that might compel them to communi-
cate about their state of affairs verbally. Xuela reveals, "We
were never the three of us together; she saw him in one room,
I saw him in another" (p. 77). Here, Kincaid begins with the
plural view and returns to the limited one, with the protago-
nist noting the characters' location, not their thoughts about
such placements. The trio forgoes the possibility for explor-
ing everyone's desire via a shared point of view, an outcome
preferable for all interests here, at least at the outset, Kincaid
implies. Although Xuela participates in shared speech with
the LaBattes in this scene, they never concern themselves
with her motives or fate.
Henry Louis Gates Jr. states that Kincaid writes about a
"self-contained world" (New York State Writer's Institute,
1999, p. 1), and her implementation of a limited view in the
novel, with some scenes punctured by instances of the first-
person-plural, invokes characters' sense of sequestration.
When Xuela returns to the LaBattes'house after aborting her
child, she finds the couple on the steps, and Kincaid main-
tains the first-person limited as the protagonist describes the
event, because the trio's members hold no shared feelings to
co-narrate. Xuela can comment only on everyone's close
proximity in location by stating, "We stood, the three of us,
in a little triangle, a trinity, not made in heaven, not made in
hell, a wordless trinity" (Kincaid, 1996, p. 93). Kincaid
retains the limited view as the narrator describes the charac-
ters' placement in the island's setting, where they are united
in a religious-like context but find no words to depict their
formation's relevance. The trinity's members fail to speak
together again before Xuela leaves the LaBattes' house once
and for all, where she has experienced her final instance of
participating in the sharing of women's speech via Kincaid's
plural view.
James (1881/1971) describes the house of fiction as hav-
ing windows "of dissimilar shape and size, [that] hang so, all
together, over the human scene" (p. 7). These windows
should allow for more similarity in viewpoint, yet they are
"mere holes in a dead wall" (p. 7), not shared markers.
Likewise, even as Kincaid broadens point-of-view concep-
tions through communities of "we" comprised mostly of
children and women in the novel, this plurality only reveals
members' collective distrust and indicates the type of con-
straints colonialism has placed on the narrator's possible
future encounters with others. Xuela, walking with her
schoolmates and talking to Lise, discards her sense of soli-
tariness via Kincaid's limited impositions of the plural view,
but only for a shared locus of fear and disappointment, a con-
text rendering Xuela's sense of alienation, as well as that of
her fellow citizens, only greater.
This is Autobiography's theme: Once one's identity has
been fractured, stolen, or altered, one's stories become incoher-
ent, implausible, and meaningless, too. The narrator's mother
represents the island's original, mythic culture, which has been
dismantled and denied. Meanwhile, Alfred, with his Scottish
African background, assumes the colonizer's stance toward his
fellow natives but can offer no positive replacement for a cul-
ture that has been eradicated either.7 Narrating alone or with
others, Xuela attempts to understand her story and locate an
empathetic or at least concerned listener, but when she either
reveals her thoughts or shares the ideas and actions of others,
such attempts to widen the narrative on her part to create mean-
ing only portray how narrow the characters' sense of them-
selves and their dimensions, limited by a colonial setting, are.
Conclusion
Autobiography is a Bildungsroman, a coming-of-age story,
but Xuela is hampered in her quest's progress by the genre's
traditional framework because she possesses few role mod-
els for growth and rejects, as a source of enlightenment, edu-
cation's place, which focuses either on the colonizers and
their imposition of Christianity, or island folklore, which fea-
tures stories about nymphs that no one registers. Abandoning
mentors and epistemological frameworks, the narrator cre-
ates her own book of values to conduct her life. She "repre-
sents the existential protagonist who seats herself at the
center of her world, constructing codes of ethics and moral-
ity that originate in her own self-conceived and self-validated
paradigms" (West, 2003, p. 8). Often, Caribbean women are
portrayed as storytellers or lascivious mulattos, "living on
the edges of urban communities belonging to no settled cul-
ture or tradition" (Nasta, 1993, p. 214). However, in Kincaid's
Hembrough 11
novel, Xuela adopts the storyteller's role to confront her cir-
cumstances and question those who have stolen, distorted, or
destroyed the island's culture. Autobiography explores the
"structures of domination, racism, sexism, and class exploi-
tation" and shows the manner in which they "make it practi-
cally impossible for black women to survive if they do not
engage in meaningful resistance" (West, 2003, p. 20), such
as storytelling.
As yet another role, Caribbean women can adopt mother-
hood "as the antidote to paternal power" (Schultheis, 2001,
n.p.). Still, this function, in many cases, "limits female sexu-
ality and identity to procreation, thereby reinscribing the met-
aphor of the family" (n.p.) and is a paradigm Xuela rejects.
The appearance of her menses provides her not only with the
ability to bear children but also with the will to give her life
meaning or mother herself. Repulsed by her island's colonial
standards and the oppression she has endured at family and
community members' hands, as defining act, Xuela commits
an abortion after leaving the LaBattes to reject another's life
and provide her own with opportunities, whatever those
might be. She states, "I had never had a mother, I had just
recently refused to become one, and I knew then that this
refusal would be complete" (Kincaid, 1996, pp. 96-97).
As readers interrogate Xuela's subjectivity, they may
expect that the tension between her sense of solitariness,
depicted by a limited view, and her struggle to empathize
with others, portrayed by the plural view, will result in the
novel's climax as she determines her position. In the end, the
narrator discovers that she must speak alone, because every-
one with whom she has attempted to forge relationships is
dead or forever unavailable. The novel's dramatizes Xuela's
hope for communication and realization that she does not
have a worldview of interest or access to anyone in her
impaired community.
However, at a few points, Kincaid, enlarging Xuela's bound-
aries, transcends both the limited and plural views as the nar-
rator addresses readers directly, as when she states, having
performed her first abortion, "I knew things that you could
only know if you had been through what I had just been
through. I carried my life in my own hands" (p. 83).Although
Xuela wants someone with whom to share her story, the tale
finally becomes one about readers' perception of the story's
subject itself. In Autobiography, Kincaid relies on a limited-
view narration because the protagonist must undertake to
understand and perceive herself. Xuela finds that her life is
"limited" (Kincaid, 1996, p. 59), as is her ability to narrate
her story, even with others' assistance via the plural view.
Yet, the protagonist considers that history has made her peo-
ple "silent" (p. 62), and to remain quiet represents a "self-
punishment" (p. 60) that she cannot endure.

Notes
1. Scholars have examined The Autobiography through gen-
der-based, colonial, politico-economical, epistemological,
idiom-related, and narratological lenses. Within the latter
two categories, Réjouis (2003) describes Xuela's alterna-
tions between French and Creole depending on her agenda,
Simon (2005) explores Kincaid's characters' ambiguous
relationship to language, Adams (2006) discusses how
Kincaid uses allegory and "self-writing" as "counter dis-
courses" to colonial texts, and Schultheis (2001) investi-
gates how Xuela appropriates multiple voices in the novel
as Kincaid disrupts traditional autobiographical forms.
However, no one has investigated fully the novel's point-
of-view considerations.
2. In deciding what to foreground, James warns fellow writers,
"Do not think too much about optimism and pessimism; try
and catch the colour of life itself" (p. 413). Interest for read-
ers lies in unique characters with matchless vantage points.
Indeed, "[h]umanity is immense, and reality has a myriad of
forms" (p. 397).
3. For Norman Friedman (1955), narrators represent a "fixed
center" (p. 108) from which all information is filtered, as if
through a camera lens, a context that Realists believed was
authentic to life. Friedman was writing when Realism repre-
sented the standard literary style, and the communal or omni-
scient voice was implemented infrequently. However, even
before midcentury, some Modernists choose the first-person-
limited to depict characters' isolation.
4. Gérard Genette (1972/1980) distinguishes between the narra-
tor or text's "voice" and the narrative point of view, and argues
for new categories combining them.
5. James (1908/1972) and Friedman (1955) contend that writers
should maintain a consistent point of view, but other authors of
the same era, such as Forster (1927/1990), disagree about such
restrictions.
6. Kincaid herself told an interviewer that she feels isolated from
her mother (Garis, 1990).
7. Similarly, Niesen de Abruna (1999) notes that "alienation from
the mother becomes a metaphor" describing "alienation from
an island culture that has been" usurped by "the imperialist
power of England" (p. 173).
