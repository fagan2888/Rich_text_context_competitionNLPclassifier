Background. Although it has been demonstrated that physical performance measures predict incident disability in
previously nondisabled older persons, the available data have not been fully developed to create usable methods for de-
termining risk profiles in community-dwelling populations. Using several populations and different follow-up periods,
this study replicates previous findings by using the Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly
(EPESE) performance battery and provides equations for the prediction of disability risk according to age, sex, and level
of performance.
Methods. Tests of balance, time to walk 8 ft, and time to rise from a chair 5 times were administered to 4,588 ini-
tially nondisabled persons in the four sites of the EPESE and to 1,946 initially nondisabled persons in the Hispanic
EPESE. Follow-up assessment for activity of daily living (ADL) and mobility-related disability occurred from 1 to 6
years later.
Results. In the EPESE, compared with those with the best performance (EPESE summary performance score of 10­
12), the relative risks of mobility-related disability for those with scores of 4­6 ranged from 2.9 to 4.9 and the relative
risk of disability for those with scores of 7­9 ranged from 1.5 to 2.1, with similar consistent results for ADL disability.
The observed rates of incident disability according to performance level in the Hispanic EPESE agreed closely with
rates predicted from models developed from the EPESE sites. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that gait
speed alone performed almost as well as the full battery in predicting incident disability.
Conclusions. Performance tests of lower extremity function accurately predict disability across diverse populations.
Equations derived from models using both the summary score and the gait speed alone allow for the estimation of risk of
disability in community-dwelling populations and provide valuable information for estimating sample size for clinical
trials of disability prevention.
NCREASINGLY, standardized tests of physical perfor-
mance have been applied in research and geriatric assess-
ment settings. Performance tests have been found to be
strongly associated with multiple measures of health status
and are predictive of important outcomes such as hip fracture,
nursing home admission, and death. It has been generally
agreed that performance measures supplement, rather than re-
place, self-report of disability. Along the theoretical pathway
from disease to disability proposed by Nagi (1) and the Insti-
tute of Medicine (2) and made operational by Verbrugge and
Jette (3), most performance measures can be considered func-
tional limitations. These functional limitations are proximal
on the pathway to disability, which represents the interaction
of performance ability with an individual's environment.
It has also been demonstrated that performance measures
can capture a hierarchy of functioning in persons who are
not disabled and even in those who are high functioning (4,5).
Furthermore, in nondisabled persons performance measures
have been shown to be predictive of the onset of incident
disability (6­9). In research from Project Safety (6) a
threshold effect was observed, whereby risk of future dis-
ability increased substantially below a certain critical level
of performance. In contrast, in the Iowa cohort of the Estab-
lished Populations for Epidemiologic Research in the Eld-
erly (EPESE), a graded effect was seen, with increasing
disability risk at each lower level of performance (9).
One important limitation of the findings from the latter
study was that it was restricted to the Iowa EPESE site, a ru-

ral, all-white cohort. Data have recently become available
that allow for the replication of the study in other EPESE
sites and for the comparison of findings both between sites
and for different lengths of follow-up. This study evaluates
findings across these sets of studies, assesses whether a sim-
ple measure of gait speed has the same predictive value for
disability as the full performance battery used in the initial
EPESE studies (9,10), presents predictive models of risk of
disability and death according to performance level, age, sex,
and number of years of follow-up, and examines how well
these models predict disability in an external, Hispanic pop-
ulation. It is then demonstrated how estimates of disability
outcomes can be used to determine sample size requirements
for clinical trials, information that is critical in planning for
interventions to prevent disability.
METHODS
Study Populations
Data are from the four sites of the EPESE and from the
Hispanic EPESE. The East Boston, Iowa, New Haven (Con-
necticut), and North Carolina sites of the EPESE comprise a
collaborative study of aging initiated by the Epidemiology,
Demography, and Biometry Program of the National Insti-
tute on Aging. After recruitment of representative popula-
tions, baseline interviews were conducted in 1981 and 1982
in East Boston, Iowa, and New Haven and in 1985 and 1986
in North Carolina. Details of the baseline assessments have
been described in detail (11,12). Annual contacts were
made for 6 years and at the sixth follow-up measures of
physical performance were added to the protocol for the
first time. Subsequent to follow-up 6, which is considered
the baseline for these analyses, interviews were performed
at 1 year in Iowa and New Haven, at 4 years in Iowa and
North Carolina, and at 6 years in New Haven. Mortality
subsequent to follow-up 6 was ascertained at all sites through
interviews, obituaries, and linkage with the National Death
Index. No interviews were performed in East Boston after
follow-up 6 and East Boston data contribute to only esti-
mates of baseline distribution of physical performance and
estimates of mortality according to baseline performance.
At follow-up 6, the number of persons not known to have
died totaled 9,974 in all sites and 9,130 (91.5%) were inter-
viewed (East Boston 2,345/2,563; Iowa 2,547/2,711; New
Haven 1,671/1,819; North Carolina 2,567/2,881). Of these,
1,778 (19.5%) were excluded because they were living in
institutions, living at home but needing a proxy respondent
because of cognitive or physical impairment, or living out-
side the area and requiring a telephone interview. Of the re-
maining 7,352 persons interviewed in person in their
homes, 141 (1.9%) refused the performance tests. To select
an initially nondisabled cohort, we excluded persons report-
ing disability in activities of daily living (ADLs) or mobil-
ity-related disability (defined below). To further reduce
disabled persons being misclassified as nondisabled at base-
line, we also excluded those 4% of participants reporting no
disability but having scores of 0 to 3 on the summary per-
formance scale (defined below). A large proportion of these
persons were unable to walk 8 ft or maintain a simple side-
by-side stand, which is incompatible with a report of ability
to walk 0.5 mile and climb stairs. This left 4,588 persons
who were initially classified as nondisabled (East Boston
1,298; Iowa 1,363; New Haven 700; North Carolina 1,227).
At follow-up, interviews to assess disability status were
performed using proxies and in nursing homes if necessary.
Among those not known to have died, follow-up disability
information was missing at 1 year in 3.2% and 3.8% of
those in Iowa and New Haven, respectively, at 4 years in
4.2% and 6.7% of those in Iowa and North Carolina, respec-
tively, and at 6 years in 5.0% of those in New Haven. After
death and loss to follow-up, subsequent information on dis-
ability status was obtained at 1 year on 1,342 persons in
Iowa and 655 persons in New Haven; at 4 years on 1,121
persons in Iowa and 962 persons in North Carolina; and at 6
years on 455 persons in New Haven.
Chronic Conditions at Baseline
We assessed chronic conditions at baseline and each an-
nual interview through follow-up 6 by asking participants if
a physician had told them they had a heart attack, stroke,
cancer, hip fracture, or diabetes. Cancer was considered
present only if the participants also reported spending one
or more nights in the hospital for the cancer. Chronic condi-
tions were considered present if mentioned at baseline or at
any follow-up interview.
Measures of Physical Performance
The physical performance battery used in the EPESE
studies, previously described in detail (9,10), evaluated
lower extremity function by using tests of gait speed, stand-
ing balance, and time to rise from a chair five times. Identi-
cal assessments were done in all sites by specially trained
interviewers, with a training videotape used to optimize
standardization of the procedures across sites. Good to ex-
cellent test­retest reliability of these tests has been demon-
strated (4,13­15). Based on data from over 5,000 persons
from the original three EPESE sites (East Boston, Iowa, and
New Haven), a five-level categorical score was created for
each test, with 0 representing inability to complete the test
and 4 representing the highest level of performance (10).
For tests of standing balance, participants attempted to
maintain the side-by-side, semitandem, and tandem posi-
tions for 10 seconds. Participants were scored 1 if they
could hold a side-by side stand for 10 seconds but were un-
able to hold a semitandem stand for 10 seconds, 2 if they
held a semitandem stand for 10 seconds but were unable to
hold a full tandem stand for more than 2 seconds, 3 if they
held the full tandem stand for 3 to 9 seconds, and 4 if they
held the full tandem stand for 10 seconds.
A usual pace, 8-ft walk was timed from a standing start,
and participants were scored according to quartiles of per-
formance. Time on the faster of two walks was used to de-
fine scores: score of 1:  5.7 seconds ( 0.43 m/s); score of 2:
4.1­5.6 seconds (0.44­0.60 m/s); score of 3: 3.2 to 4.0 sec-
onds (0.61­0.77 m/s); score of 4:  3.1 seconds ( 0.78 m/s).
Participants were asked to fold their arms across their
chest and to stand up once from a chair. If successful they
were asked to stand up and sit down five times as quickly as
possible. Quartiles of performance for the repeat chair
stands were used to define scores as follows: score of 1:
LOWER EXTREMITY FUNCTION AND SUBSEQUENT DISABILITY M223
 16.7 seconds; score of 2: 16.6­13.7 seconds; score of 3:
13.6­11.2 seconds; score of 4:  11.1 seconds.
A summary performance score was created by summation
of the scores for tests of standing balance, gait speed, and ris-
ing from a chair 5 times. This scale has been demonstrated to
have predictive validity in analyses showing a gradient of
risk for mortality, nursing home admission, and incident dis-
ability (7,9,10). The internal consistency of the summary
scale as assessed by Cronbach's alpha was 0.76 (10). The
subjects in this report were nondisabled at baseline and had
summary performance scores ranging from 4 to 12.
In addition to the summary performance score, gait speed
alone was assessed for its relation to incident disability. An
8-ft (2.44 m) walk was used in EPESE because of concern
about limited space in participants' homes. However, for
the assessment of gait speed over a short distance we be-
lieve the 4-m walk is now the distance of choice because it
has been demonstrated to be feasible in the home as well as
in the clinical setting and its longer distance may improve
measurement accuracy. In the Women's Health and Aging
Study it was demonstrated that in small houses and apart-
ments in Baltimore a 4-m walk was possible for 90% of
subjects, with 9% requiring a 3-m walk and 0.8% not hav-
ing space for a 3-m walk (16). Because of the advantage of
using the 4-m walk for both home and clinic gait speed
tests, we converted velocity in the 8-ft walk into estimated
velocity for a 4-m walk in all analyses presented here. This
conversion was accomplished with data from the University
of Kansas Prediction of Elder Performance Study. In that
study, 700 assessments were done in which time was mea-
sured for both an 8-ft and a 4-m walk. Velocity for both
tests was converted to meters per second. The correlation
between velocities was 0.97. Piecewise linear regression
was used to evaluate whether the relationship between 8-ft
walk velocity and 4-m walk velocity was linear. A model
with a single break point and change in slope had a signifi-
cantly better fit than a straight linear model. The break point
that maximized the R2, determined iteratively, was at an 8-ft
gait speed of 1 m/s (R2  0.96). The observed data showed
that, on average, the ratio of 4-m walk velocity to 8-ft walk
velocity (both expressed in meters per second) was 1.065
for 8-ft walk velocity  1.0 m/s and 1.016 for 8-ft walk ve-
locity 1.0 m/s. The following equations were used to con-
vert 8-ft gait speed to 4-m gait speed:
For 8-ft gait speed  1.0 m/s
For 8-ft gait speed 1.0 m/s
When these equations are used, the quartiles used for the
categorization of gait speed when a participant is perform-
ing a 4-m walk would become 1:  0.46 m/s; 2: 0.47­0.64
m/s; 3: 0.65­0.82 m/s; 4:  0.83 m/s.
Disability Status at Follow-up
Disability status at follow-up, based on self-report or
proxy report, used a three-level hierarchical scale (9,17) that
contains a subset of questions from a scale originally devel-
oped by Berkman and colleagues (18). This scale, used to

exclude those with disability at baseline, was used to clas-
sify subjects at follow-up as having no disability, having
mobility-related disability (inability to walk 0.5 mile or
climb stairs without help), or having disability in ADLs
(having mobility-related disability plus the inability to per-
form one or more of the following activities without help
from another person: moving from a bed to a chair, using
the toilet, bathing, and walking across a small room). Be-
cause the baseline performance tests measured lower ex-
tremity function, disability items related to lower extremity
function were used. At each follow-up in all sites less than
2% of persons did not fit the hierarchical pattern, reporting
disability in ADLs but not in mobility-related disability.
These persons were classified as having disability in ADLs.
Hispanic EPESE
Predictive models developed from the original EPESE
sites were evaluated with data from the Hispanic EPESE, a
population-based study of 3,050 community-dwelling Mex-
ican Americans living in five Southwestern states (19). The
baseline assessment, including the same self-report items on
disability and the same performance battery, was completed
in 1993­1994. A follow-up interview was performed 2
years later, in 1995­1996, at which time mortality and dis-
ability data were ascertained (7).
Statistical Analysis
Rates of ADL and mobility disability were calculated ac-
cording to summary performance score for each site and ac-
cording to number of follow-up years. Multiple logistic
models, adjusting for age, sex, and number of chronic con-
ditions, were used to predict the relative risk of disability for
those with summary performance scores of 4­6 and 7­9
compared with the reference group, those with scores of 10­
12. Interactions between performance scores and other vari-
ables in the models were examined but there was no consis-
tency seen across sites or follow-up times for the few
interactions that were significant. Meta-analytic techniques
were used to test for homogeneity for the two sites with
1-year follow-up data and the two sites with 4-year follow-
up data (20).
To compare the relative predictive ability of gait speed
with that of the summary performance score, receiver-oper-
ator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and tested
with AccuROC software (Accumetric Corp., Montreal).
Gait speed was categorized as deciles for these analyses. Ar-
eas under the curves were calculated, and comparison of
these areas was done with the method of Hanley and Mc-
Neil (21,22).
In addition to evaluating relative risk, these data were
used to estimate absolute risk of disability. Risk of disability
was modeled in multiple logistic equations in which age,
sex, and either summary performance score as an ordinal
variable or gait speed as a continuous variable were entered.
Coefficients from these models were used to construct
equations that predict the absolute risk of disability accord-
ing to these variables. Estimated risks predicted from the
models are compared graphically with actual observed risk.
For specific levels of performance, we calculated prediction
of disability risk by entering into the predictive equation
M224 GURALNIK ET AL.
that level of performance and the average age and sex distri-
bution for that level of performance. In the same way, actual
rate of disability after 2 years in the Hispanic EPESE cohort
was compared with predicted risk for each baseline perfor-
mance score after 1 and 4 years by use of the EPESE predic-
tive equations.
Additional data are furnished to make it possible to esti-
mate transitions along all steps in the pathway from encoun-
tering a community-dwelling population, to estimating the
proportion initially disability free, to predicting the rate of
survival and incident disability in survivors. The distribu-
tion of summary performance scores and categories of gait
speed according to age and sex were estimated by being
treated as ordinally scaled dependent variables in polychot-
omous logistic regression models (SAS procedure CAT-
MOD) (23). The estimates calculated from this model for
men and women of specific ages are provided in additional
tables, which also provide information on the proportion ex-
pected to be nondisabled at each performance level. Rather
than being adjusted for chronic disease status, which would
make results for different age and sex subgroups more simi-
lar to each other, the analyses are not adjusted in order to
present each age and sex group's performance distribution
as you would find it in the community. Multiple logistic
models were used to estimate risk of mortality according to
age, sex, and performance, and equations are presented that
predict absolute risk of mortality according to these vari-
ables. Preliminary to these analyses we performed site-spe-
cific analyses for mortality and found that the coefficients
for age, sex, and performance were similar across sites.
Examples illustrate how these findings can be used to es-
timate mortality and disability outcomes for 80-year-old men
and for a mixed cohort selected for a clinical trial.
RESULTS
Lower Extremity Function as a Predictor of Disability
Figure 1 illustrates the proportion of initially nondisabled
persons developing ADL and mobility disability according
to summary performance score, site, and years of follow-up.
For each group there is a decline in risk of disability with in-
creasing performance. There is a higher risk for mobility
disability than for ADL disability, and a higher proportion
of persons become disabled with longer follow-up periods.
There is consistency across sites for the 1-year follow-up re-
sults (Iowa and New Haven) and 4-year follow-up results
(Iowa and North Carolina).
Table 1 shows the adjusted risk of initially nondisabled
participants developing mobility disability at follow up.
Compared with those with a baseline performance score of
9­12, persons with a score of 4­6 had a relative risk ranging
from 2.9 to 4.9, whereas those with a score of 7­9 had a rel-
ative risk ranging from 1.5 to 2.1. Similar consistency in
findings is demonstrated for risk of ADL disability in Table
2. Meta-analysis demonstrated the homogeneity of findings
for ADL and mobility outcomes at 1 year and at 4 years.
Gait Speed Alone Versus the Summary
Performance Score
Of the three components of the summary performance
scale, the steepest gradient of risk for disability has been ob-
served across categories of gait speed (7,9). Because gait
speed is easy to measure and may be done quickly in the
clinical setting, it is useful to evaluate whether measuring
gait speed alone may capture the predictive power of a more
comprehensive battery. To examine this we created ROC
curves for the prediction of ADL and mobility disability,
examining the gait speed component of the summary per-
formance score and the summary performance score itself.
Figure 2 illustrates that the area under all ROC curves is
65% or greater, with all curves significantly different from a
diagonal line that indicates zero predictive ability of the test.
In each case the summary score performs better than the
gait speed. However, for predicting ADL disability at 4
years the two curves are not substantively or significantly
different from each other. For the other three comparisons
the curves do differ significantly from each other but the
difference in area under the curves is not substantial, rang-

performance score, site, and number of years of follow-up (f/u).

ing from 3% to 5%. These findings indicate that gait speed
alone is nearly as good a predictor of disability outcomes as
the full performance battery. Predictive models for disabil-
ity and mortality will thus be presented for both measures.
Predicted and Observed Disability Outcomes
Table 3 combines data from the two sites with 1-year fol-
low-up (Iowa and New Haven) and the two sites with the
4-year follow-up (Iowa and North Carolina) to present
equations that estimate probability of disability. These
equations result from multiple logistic models that adjust
for age and sex. When age, sex, and summary performance
score or gait speed are entered into the equations, an esti-
mate of disability risk can be obtained. To examine how
well these models fit the data and predict observed disabil-
ity risk, the probability of disability associated with specific
summary performance scores and gait velocities was calcu-
lated with the equations in Table 3. Figure 3 illustrates the
predicted risk of disability and the actual risk observed in
the study cohorts. The fit is excellent, with minor deviations
between predicted and observed occurring mainly at the
lower end of performance, where the data are more sparse
than at the upper end.
The predictive accuracy of the equations was further as-
sessed by examination of data from an external source, the
Hispanic EPESE. This cohort had a 2-year follow-up after
the baseline assessment of performance. Figure 4 shows the
observed Hispanic EPESE ADL and mobility disability
rates at 2 years and compares them with predicted rates for
1 and 4 years generated from the equations derived from
EPESE data. The observed rates generally fall within the 1-
and the 4-year predictions. Overall, in the Hispanic EPESE
cohort with no ADL or mobility disability at baseline with a
summary performance score of 4­12 (n  1319), 52 cases
of ADL disability and 211 cases of mobility disability were
observed at 2 years of follow-up. The predictive models
projected that at 1 and 4 years, ADL disability would be
present in 29 and 69 persons and mobility disability would
be present in 181 and 272 persons, respectively.
Characterizing Performance and Predicting Functional
Outcomes in a Community-Dwelling Population
With confirmation that performance measures can accu-
rately predict disability outcomes in groups, it is valuable to
further exploit the rich EPESE database to characterize per-
formance levels and outcomes that can be expected to be
found in a representative population. These descriptive data
and predictive models may then be applied to other popula-
tions. Available EPESE data provide information on the dis-
tributions of the summary performance score and gait speed
in representative older populations, and, according to level
of performance, the proportion of the population that is ex-
pected to be nondisabled when first encountered, the pro-
portion expected to die over time, and, finally, the proportion
that is predicted to become disabled. With data from all four
EPESE sites, Appendix A shows the distribution of the
summary performance score according to age and sex. It
also shows the proportion of persons in each performance
category that is initially nondisabled in ADLs and mobility
and thus at risk of future disability. Appendix B shows sim-

ilar data for gait speed. By using these data one can calcu-
late the proportion of persons of a specific age that have a
gait speed within a certain range who might be candidates
for a specific intervention or clinical trial. It should be noted
that these gait speeds are lower than those measured in
many previous studies of gait speed and aging (24). Most of
those studies, performed in gait laboratories, made measure-
ments after subjects reached their full speed, as opposed to
the home assessment done in the EPESE, in which subjects
were timed from a standing start. Appendix C presents
equations resulting from multiple logistic analyses that pre-
dict probability of death according to age, sex, and perfor-
mance.
Table 4 demonstrates how the data provided here can be
used to characterize a population and predict outcomes over
time. With data from Appendix A, the distribution of the
summary performance score in one-thousand 80-year-old
men is shown in column 2. Further, with data from Appen-
dix A on the proportion of nondisabled persons, column 3
shows the actual number expected to be nondisabled. The
probability of death at 1 year is estimated when age, sex,
and summary performance score are inserted into the first
equation listed in Appendix C. The number of men surviv-
ing at each level of performance score can then be calcu-
lated. The probability of mobility disability is then estimated
when age, sex, and summary performance score are inserted

DISCUSSION
This article reproduces findings from previous studies
that physical performance measures of lower extremity
function predict the onset of disability in those initially re-
porting no disability in ADLs, walking a half mile and
climbing stairs. The performance battery and gait speed
alone were significant predictors of incident disability as
long as 6 years after they were done. The absolute risk of
disability increased with longer follow-up time (Figure 1)
but, irrespective of time to follow-up, there was excellent
consistency among the relative risks comparing the low-
and medium-performance individuals with those with high
performance (Tables 1 and 2). It appears that the predictive
power of the performance measures wanes somewhat at 6
years, as the relative risk for the low- versus the high-per-
formance groups was somewhat lower than for the shorter
follow-ups. However, it is striking that after 6 years the in-
creased risk associated with low performance on this sim-
ple, brief performance battery done by an interviewer in the
participant's home is still of substantial magnitude and is
statistically significant. This is especially impressive con-
sidering the high rate of intervening and catastrophic condi-
tions occurring in persons in their 70s and 80s followed
over a long period of time.
Our findings may be directly compared with the results in
a recent report by Ostir and colleagues on the 2-year follow-
up of the Hispanic EPESE, for which the performance bat-
tery was performed in the same way (7). The relative risk of
mobility-related disability was 4.8 in their low-performance
group and 2.4 in their middle-performance group, compared
with the high-performance group. Relative risks for ADL
disability were 6.2 and 2.0, respectively. These relative
risks are very similar to the estimates shown in Tables 1 and
2 for three EPESE sites with different lengths of follow-up.
It is essential to examine whether the models developed
to test the relationship between performance and incident
disability not only indicate an elevated relative risk but also
accurately predict the actual rate of disability. We first
found that predictions made from the models worked very
well in predicting the observed outcomes in the cohorts
used to develop the models (Figure 3), indicating that the
models fit the data from which they were derived quite well.
The true test of a model's predictive ability, however, is to
test it by using an external data set. This was done with the
Hispanic EPESE. Although we could not make direct pre-
dictions for the 2-year Hispanic EPESE follow-up period, it
was possible to compare these observations with 1- and 4-year
predictions. Considering the differences in the ethnicity of
the cohorts and the regions in which the studies were done,
it was remarkable how well the models predicted the range
of the observed rates of disability in the Hispanic EPESE at
2 years (Figure 4). This evidence supports the validity and
the robustness of these simple measures of performance and
supports their use in developing disability risk estimates for
diverse populations. Analyses within the North Carolina co-
hort also revealed no clear evidence for differences in the
relationship of performance with disability between whites
and African Americans (data not shown).
This research also demonstrated that assessing gait speed
alone is nearly as good as performing the full battery of per-
formance tests in the prediction of incident disability. This
is a valuable finding to support the routine measurement of
gait speed in older persons in the clinical setting, in which it
may be quite useful to have an objective measure of lower
extremity functioning, but in which there may not be time to
perform a full performance battery. Gait speed assessment
may also be an efficient tool as the first step in screening a
large number of older persons to identify and recruit into
clinical trials persons with a specific level of functioning.
The equations presented in this report allow for estimation
of disability and mortality risk in persons who are initially
nondisabled, as determined from the few self-report ques-
tions used here, and for whom a gait speed has been mea-
sured.
The question of whether to abandon the full performance
battery and use gait speed alone in all clinical and research
settings is a difficult one. Certainly the assessment of rising
from a chair and balance give information that may be of
value in understanding the pathway from disease to disabil-
ity (3). Specific diseases and impairments may affect spe-
cific aspects of lower extremity function, which may then
determine the characteristics of an individual's disability.
Furthermore, measuring a specific construct with multiple
measures increases reliability (25), so some measurement
accuracy may be gained by using the full battery. For this
reason, the full battery is likely to be a better instrument in
which to assess change over time. In the Iowa EPESE co-
hort, the summary performance battery had a mean decline
of 1.6 points over 4 years, with 67% of the sample declin-
ing, 17% improving, and 16% remaining unchanged (26).
Validity of the change scores was supported by the findings
that, with adjustment for baseline performance, the sum-
mary performance score declined more in those  80 years
old, having less education, and having coronary heart disease
and chronic lung disease. Furthermore, declines in summary
performance score were sensitive to the presence of depres-

sion at baseline, even after adjustment for baseline perfor-
mance, demographic characteristics, behavioral risk factors,
and chronic disease status.
Ultimately, knowledge gained from observational epide-
miologic studies must be translated into strategies to pre-
vent or reduce disease and disability. The real value of the
findings on performance measures presented here is that
they provide a strategy to target disability prevention inter-
ventions to high-risk groups that can be identified with a
simple screening battery or even just a test of walking speed.
The reference tables here provide the information needed to
estimate the distribution of performance levels that can be
anticipated to be present in the community and the probabil-
ity that persons of a specific age, sex, and performance level
will develop disability. This information allows for the ra-
tional development of estimates of disability risk that will
put the calculation of sample sizes needed for these studies
on a much more empirical footing. It should be noted that
these estimates are for persons living in the community who
are in their usual state of health and are not appropriate for
estimating risk for persons who have acute illnesses or are
just being discharged from the hospital.
The largest benefit for the effort expended in disability
prevention programs may come from intervening not on
those at the best level of functioning but on persons with
lower levels of functioning. Thus, screening a nondisabled
population and recruiting persons with summary perfor-
mance scores ranging from 4 to 9 would yield a population
with a high risk of disability. The higher rate of events in
this population would allow for a reduced sample size com-
pared with intervening on very high functioning individuals.
Furthermore, nondisabled persons who are objectively dem-
onstrated to have reduced performance may be on a pro-
gressively downward trajectory, so their functional abilities
and quality of life could be substantially improved with a
timely and well-focused intervention. This approach can
support future efforts to reduce disability at both an individ-
ual and a public health level.

Sample Sizes in Clinical Trials
The InChianti Study is an observational study of 1,340
persons in the Chianti region of Italy. A subset of nondis-
abled participants will also be invited to participate in a
demonstration project that tests the impact of physical activ-
ity on disability incidence. This limited project is funded for
interventions on 100 persons. The targets of this interven-
tion will be persons with a summary performance score
ranging from 4 to 9, chosen because they are at high risk of
incident disability. Data and predictive equations presented
in this report are used to estimate the distribution of perfor-
mance in this cohort, expected survival, and expected dis-
ability rates. When these results are used, the power of the
study to show a significant intervention effect can be esti-
mated.
Table 1A shows the expected distribution of participants
according to the sample drawn from the local census (col-
umn 2). The distribution of summary performance score at
each age is estimated from Appendix A, and column 3
shows the total number of persons expected to have a sum-
mary score of 4 to 9 by age group. For each specific age,
sex, and summary score level, the proportion of nondisabled
persons is estimated from data in Appendix A, the propor-
tion of surviving persons is estimated from equations in Ap-

LOWER EXTREMITY FUNCTION AND SUBSEQUENT DISABILITY M231
pendix C, and the proportion of persons becoming disabled
in 1 year is estimated from equations in Table 3. This is
done in the same way that the estimates were made for a
specific age and sex in Table 4. Numbers shown in the table
aggregate estimates across summary scores of 4 to 9 for
each age/sex group.
Overall, of 168 men in the cohort who are predicted to
have a summary performance score of 4­9 and survive 1
year, 28 (16.7%) are expected to have mobility disability at
one year. Of 242 surviving women with an initial perfor-
mance score of 4­9, 44 (18.0%) are expected to have mobil-
ity disability at 1 year. The intervention is hypothesized to
reduce disability by half from the 17% expected. For an al-
pha of .05 and a power of 50%, this magnitude of effect
could be demonstrated in a study with over 120 persons in
both the intervention and the control groups (27). Thus this
demonstration project, which is limited to 100 persons, is
substantially underpowered to show a significant effect of
exercise, even with a proposed halving of disability rates.
To reach an acceptable power as a formal clinical trial this
demonstration project would require an increased sample
size.
