Developing a feeling for error:
Practices of monitoring and
modelling air pollution data
Emma Garnett
Abstract
This paper is based on ethnographic research of data practices in a public health project called Weather Health and Air
Pollution. (All names are pseudonyms.) I examine two different kinds of practices that make air pollution data, focusing
on how they relate to particular modes of sensing and articulating air pollution. I begin by describing the interstitial
spaces involved in making measurements of air pollution at monitoring sites and in the running of a computer simulation.
Specifically, I attend to a shared dimension of these practices, the checking of a numerical reading for error. Checking a
measurement for error is routine practice and a fundamental component of making data, yet these are also moments of
interpretation, where the form and meaning of numbers are ambiguous. Through two case studies of modelling and
monitoring data practices, I show that making a `good' (error free) measurement requires developing a feeling for the
instrument­air pollution interaction in terms of the intended functionality of the measurements made. These affective
dimensions of practice are useful analytically, making explicit the interaction of standardised ways of knowing and
embodied skill in stabilising data. I suggest that environmental data practices can be studied through researchers'
materialisation of error, which complicate normative accounts of Big Data and highlight the non-linear and entangled
relations that are at work in the making of stable, accurate data.

Introduction
Air is not a one, it does not offer fixity or community,
but it is no less substantial. The question is whether we
can feel it. (Choy, 2012: 121)
Choy's description of air encompasses its materiality
and immateriality, its multiplicity and fluidity through
which he inquires: how do we feel this amorphous
yet substantial thing? In his chapter entitled `Air's
Substantiations', Choy uses air as a heuristic to capture
the many atmospheric experiences air provides, among
them dust, oxygen, dioxin, smell, particulate matter,
visibility, humidity, heat, and various gases (2012:
127). His subsequent abstraction of air into `atmos-
pheric experiences' involves an interweaving of the mul-
tiple encounters air makes possible, producing what he
calls a `poetics of air'. This conceptualisation of air
enables him to trace the particular and everyday experi-
ences of `honghei' (ambient air) in Hong Kong, along-
side the scientific and technical practices which seek to
measure and scale air as a universal category. These
experiences, he shows, are different ways of feeling air.
I begin with Choy's descriptions of `airy matters'
because he captures both human­material

entanglements with air, and the different sensory scales
and registers at work within these. The story of air is
increasingly described in relation to human activities, as
the result of life-styles in modern industrial societies
(Sloterdijk, 2009: 88). Air pollution is very much a
hybrid thing (Haraway, 1991; Latour, 1999b), under-
stood as the product of human and non-human rela-
tions which have actively changed the material
constitution of air. Data generation has also actively
shaped what constitutes air, and how air is experienced
and engaged with. Occasions of measuring air are pro-
liferating: from government-led monitoring devices to
global scale computer models, and from participatory-
modes of citizen science (Gabrys, 2014) to the collecting
of data through mobile phone apps (e.g., the London
Air iPhone app by the London Air Quality Network),
which make new kinds of relations of air sensible. As
research on urban spaces and `smart cities' have
emphasised, digital data's ability to record different
kinds of sensations and states (Gabrys, 2014; Thrift,
2014; Tironi and Sanchez Criado, 2015), multiply the
ways in which data are now made and used.
Technical devices that sense air and make it measur-
able are also prescriptive, configured by metrics
and methods of measurement and compartmentalised
into different species of particles and gases. Yet, as
social studies of informational practices have shown,
standards and classification have socio-material and
political effects because they effect what will, or will
not, be made visible (Bowker and Star, 1999). The
notion of the `making up' of data (Boellstorff, 2013:
cf. Hacking, 2006) has been used to delineate the mater-
ial and political dimensions of Big Data. Particular
focus has been on transactional and surveillance data
(Beer and Burrows, 2013), personal health data and the
quantified-self movement (Lupton, 2014a, 2014b;
Nafus and Sherman, 2014) and what this means for
empirical sociology (Savage and Burrows, 2009).
These studies pose new questions about the ethics and
politics of Big Data, particularly in terms of how data
are rendered meaningful and functional through every-
day practices of data production, use and analysis.
There have been fewer studies, however, critically
exploring scientific data practices and how these differ-
ent kinds of Big Data are `made up' in order to carry
meaning and have political effects. Environmental data,
in the form of air pollution data, are my specific focus
in this paper. Scientific data of air pollution as part of
other environmental Big Data raise particular kind of
issues. The proliferation of methods to measure and
make data of air pollution may even shift the object
of study and therefore the relationship between
human bodies and their environments. As Mei at al.'s
(2014) research on `sniffing social media' shows, by
using text content from social media posts with
spatiotemporal correlations among cities and days it
is possible to measure and predict air quality in very
different ways. This expansion of what should or can be
monitored is also raised by Ottinger and Zurer (2011),
who point out that introducing monitoring technolo-
gies for communities to measure their exposure
(rather than relying on data generated by local indus-
tries) assumes a benchmark for good/bad air can be set.
The authors suggest that expanding who can measure
air quality will not resolve the politics of air and data.
Indeed, focusing only on the endpoint of data closes
down alternative probings into how standards are
achieved, concerns about air pollution stabilised, and
decisions about what should and can be measured
made. Acknowledging the role of air pollution data as
part of these Big Data practices is vital if we are to
understand the intricate ways in which environmental
data gain scientific and political affordance.
Based on ethnographic fieldwork as member of
a multi-disciplinary public health project called
Weather, Health and Air Pollution (WHAP), in this
paper I examine a key component of making environ-
mental data: sensing error. I will examine the checking
for error in two different data practices of air pollution
­ modelling and monitoring ­ focusing on the devices
involved in these practices, and the material processes
of collecting, capturing and `making present' air pollu-
tion. I focus on modelling and monitoring practices due
to their very different ways of managing `error' (within
WHAP these data were often opposed and contrasted).
The different properties and meanings of modelled and
monitored data meant they also caused tensions for
researchers trying to share and combine these data
across different situated practices. By focusing on how
error was managed, I was able to go on and explore
internal differences within data rather than only exter-
nal differences between data (which researchers already
acknowledged). Starting out with the performative
dimensions and potential of data practices when mean-
ing and value remain uncertain, I pay attention to the
craftwork of articulating error, and therefore the stabi-
lising of numerical measurements as mobile forms.
Embodiment and performance:
Distinguishing data from error
As Gitelman and Jackson write, data are `evolving
assemblages rather than discrete entities', which need
to be understood as `framed and framing' (2013: 5).
Drawing on ethnographic research of environmental
data practices, I found air pollution data were similarly
made through particular framings, both in terms
of their considered geographic and environmental con-
text and their role in national and global modes of gov-
ernance. Error was a way to come to understand how
2 Big Data & Society
data were framed because what counted as error was
shaped by the anticipated material form and discursive
use. Indeed, to publish data on public platforms, in
official documents or in academic journals requires
accounting for `omissions' ­ how error was managed
in data production.
Bowker et al. suggest that the invisible work and
`quiet politics' of knowledge infrastructure are how
values, policies and modes of practice become
embedded in larger informational systems. If we con-
sider air pollution data as part of a wider system of
environmental health governance, then the work of
making and maintaining this system need to be
explored. Accordingly, data infrastructures can also
be performative in enabling, or not, how data are clas-
sified and therefore how air pollution is made visible.
In practice, classification is articulated through visual
platforms, which enable modellers, for example, to
manipulate and `play with' atmospheric structures
and processes on the computer screen (Alac, 2008).
Seeing and responding to changes in a measuring
instrument also result from the cultivating of an intu-
ition for the phenomena being studied. It is this invis-
ible craftwork of scientific practices tied up with the
generation of environmental data which often get
negated through a focus on what data do and how to
analyse Big Data.
Error, I found, was a key part of crafting data and
classifying what counts as data of air pollution. This is
not an issue of determining right from wrong, because,
as Bowker et al. have pointed out, part of what makes a
good classification scheme is the enabling of compar-
ability and prescription, an effective level of complexity.
Thus, it is the craft of the data technician and scientist
to make a judgement about how differentiated to make
the classification (Bowker et al., 1995: 347). This
mutual process of constructing and shaping differences
through classification systems is crucial in our concep-
tualisation of any reality (1995: 346). Moreover, con-
ceptualising classification as performative aligns with
contemporary interests in STS and philosophy of sci-
ence which foreground the material, relational and
ontological dimensions of scientific practice (Barad,
2007; Coopmans et al., 2014; Mol, 2002; Myers,
2015b). Indeed, an interest in the situated and lively
nature of data ­ their socio-material lives (Helgesson,
2010; Leonelli, 2009, 2010; Michael, 2004) ­ has
resulted from a particular emphasis on the embodied
and imaginative work that render data sense-able and
sensible (Myers, 2015a).
In terms of error, it is this sense that the measure-
ment is measuring the unintended that forces research-
ers to understand and materialise error as a form
`other' to that being studied. Further, error is interest-
ing sociologically because it suggests a correction from
normative expectations about `the real'. As Tilly (1996)
has argued, error-correction is also a counter-factual
explanation crucial to understanding social relations
and therefore the duration of, for example, socio-tech-
nical assemblages. By focusing on error in air pollution
data practices alternative `theories of the possible' may
emerge because responses to error are neither instru-
mental nor random; they draw on historically accumu-
lated understandings from culture (1996: 598). This
point has also been developed by Sennett: using the
coupling of resistance and ambiguity in craftwork
(2009: 205). He argues that repairs and responses to
unexpected outcomes are productive for material
knowledge making, and it is at these moments that
imaginations of and competence in coming to know
an object can be expanded.
The different properties of error in modelling and
monitoring problematise the assumption that data are
direct measures of air pollution, and instead highlight
the active ways in which the modification of data and
thereby what constitutes air pollution take place in
everyday environmental knowledge practices.
Reflecting on the conceptual capacities of `error', I sug-
gest, opens up avenues for thinking about and research-
ing the configuring of technical devices, bodily
movements and materials (and their relations) that
remain alternative (Sennett, 2009: 200), whilst remain-
ing very much a part of these environmental data.
Different data practices, shifting
articulations of error
The first case study I am going to describe is an air
pollution monitoring station. The PI (Principal
Investigator) put me in touch with a contact involved
in monitoring air pollution in City 1, and who was also
a member of WHAP's advisory committee. This led to
me attending a routine monitoring site trip, during
which I observed the process of checking monitors
were functioning correctly and recording the perfor-
mance of the monitors as part of wider `quality assur-
ance' processes.
The second case study was a very different kind of
material setting, and focuses on the data practices of
the atmospheric chemists on WHAP who used large-
scale computer models to simulate atmospheric pro-
cesses of air pollution. This involved sharing an office
with two key modellers to observe and participate in
model runs, and was followed up by emails and phone
conversations to explicate these processes further,
allowing me to ask questions and query particular
motions and interpretations of model outputs.
Spending time with the modellers also enabled me to
experience the banality and the everyday-ness of mod-
elling as particular kinds of data practices.

Although these case studies took place in distinct
locations, both modelled and monitored data were cen-
tral to weekly team discussions, during which their dif-
ference and comparability were considered and very
often contested. Following traces and the formation
of objects (Latour, 2005; Latour and Woolgar, 1986)
is an Actor Network Theory inspired approach to the
study of knowledge, which accounts for the agency of
human and non-human forms and relations, and
attends to how these are constituted in and articulated
through socio-material practices. Indeed, it was
through articulated differences by researchers on
WHAP, that I came to appreciate the role error
played in the making of air pollution data. By following
the material practices of data making, I was able to
render visible some of the ways in which particular
data practices were embedded in a wider network of
relations. Tracing these associations was a continual
process because heterogeneous relations are always
shifting, (re)producing and reshuffling all kinds of
actors, including data, scientists and their institutional
arrangements (Latour, 2005; Law and Hassard, 1999).
Case study 1: Monitoring instruments
We start by climbing up the outdoor stairway to the
roof of the school. On top of the roof I see a grey porta-
cabin [. . .] On entering, I am greeted by a set of four
large rectangular boxes stacked on top of each other,
supported by a shelving unit. Inside the boxes are two
tubes, one attached to an outlet in the roof and the
other connecting to four stacked boxes. To the left of
the shelving unit are two gas canisters [which later
I learnt host the different certified gases]. (Fieldnotes
City 1, 25 October 2012)
The monitoring station I discuss here is a `back-
ground'2 monitoring station, which, I was told, had
been used to collect measurement for seventeen years.
The area has four other sites, and this was known as
`number one', which relates to its relatively long his-
tory. Phil, an air monitoring expert, visits the site
every two weeks to test the calibration equipment.
Calibration is a process whereby the measurement
made is compared with another `true' measurement in
order to test it for error. This is one part of a much
more elaborate process of testing collected data for
error. Indeed, monitoring sites are also visited by engin-
eers and auditors, so the site check I attended was one
among many others to ensure `quality data'.
Air pollution is monitored across the UK, initiated
by central government and often carried out by local
councils. Measurements are collected at different moni-
toring sites, and these are organised into different
networks according to the location of the site. For
example, London has one accredited `air quality net-
work' managed by government departments, local
councils, university research groups and environmental
agencies. The pollutants measured at the site I visited
included: ozone (O3
), particulate matter (PM10
), oxides
of nitrogen (NOx
) and sulphur dioxide (SO2
).3 The pur-
pose of these measurement data are stated as twofold,
as providing the public and authorities `real-time'4
information on current air pollution levels, and to
enable short-term and long-term responses to air pol-
lution as a public health concern (DEFRA, 2012a).
Using the data produced at monitoring stations, air
pollution levels are reported in `real time', on a scale
that informs the public of air quality in different areas,
inciting recommendations and actions to protect
health.
Zero air and the calibration test
`Error' is a term used for a numerical reading not con-
sidered as measuring air pollution accurately. However,
error is not always a mistake, although this is
accounted for, but also a scale, an acceptable range of
variability. In this way, error seems to be a part of
measuring, rather than an unanticipated outcome.
There are many different reasons for an erroneous
measurement and the aim of a `calibration test' is to
control and account for some of these. In order to make
a non-erroneous measurement, it is essential that the
instrument used does not influence the measurement
being taken. The main cause of error that calibration
tests for is `the drift' of the instrument from `zero'. Zero
is a term used to denote a baseline from which a meas-
urement can be made, to construct an `unmediated set-
ting'. If the baseline is not zero, then the instrument is
drifting by the difference between the measurement
taken and zero. Drift is, then, a measurement too,
and is a technique that accounts for the margin of
error in a measurement.
Zero air (also referred to as `pure air') is understood
as air with no pollutants in it. Zero air does not exist in
the environment, but has to be actively made using a
scrubber, a device that quite literally scrubs away the
parts of the air that are not being measured. The notion
of pure air was described by Phil, the technician and
researcher who I attended the site check with, as a
standardised external reference material, made on-site
or in a laboratory, and which can be physically intro-
duced into the measurement setting in order to test for
error. Without this fabricated reference point, the
measurement made cannot be stabilised as data. Phil
mediated the standard and the actual measurement in
his manual calibration test, where the standard became
a way to gain purchase on the authenticity of the
4 Big Data & Society
measurement. In this way, pure air was created to pro-
duce a kind of `objective nature' through which error
and measures of air could be made material and `real'.
Each monitor takes an air sample and measures the
concentration of, in our case here, ozone, in the sample
with a sensor. The measurement is the concentration of
ozone in the sample with a metric of one-millionth of a
gram per cubic meter air (mg/m3). The air sample is
drawn into tubes by a pump unit connecting the outside
of the station with the indoor instruments (see
Figure 1). A measurement is made with a UV light
beam that shines through the tube and reacts with the
different chemical components in the air sample. The
tubes are called single reaction cells and are fitted with
pneumatic valves, which enable them to switch between
the zero measure and the sampled ambient air paths.
The measure of ozone is the measure of this reaction in
comparison to the measurement taken made with zero
air. Without this comparative process no measurement
can be made.
The reading is the level of absorption of ozone in the
UV beam, compared with the measurement made of
absorbance of the pollutant in the zero air sample.
Phil explained to me that it is the switching between
these measurements which results in the making of
data of air pollution, where the monitor is:
[. . .] alternately measuring the absorption of the air
path with no ozone present (zero air) and the absorp-
tion in the ambient sample. Gases pass through these
UV beams and absorb some of the transmitted energy,
which appear in the measured absorbance data.
(Fieldnotes, 25 October 2012)
What this explanation shows is the multiple kinds of
measurements being made in the process of working
out the concentration of an air pollutant in an air
sample (considered as ambient air). Indeed, there is
no baseline, as I've detailed, so measurements of air
with the pollutant in and air with no pollutants in are
made and used in order to construct a measure of air
pollution. The purpose of testing this process is to
check whether the monitoring device is measuring air
pollution concentrations accurately, so that the
inaccuracy of the measures can be accounted for in
the final data. What is interesting here is the multiple
measurements made in the process of configuring a
final measure of air pollution.
Seeing error, sensing data
The flux that results from the manual calibration test is
visible. As I sat next to Phil, a series of numbers
appeared very quickly on the small screen at the front
of the monitoring boxes. Indeed, numbers were con-
tinuously shown on the front of the box as air was
constantly pumped through the tube and measured.
(Fieldnotes, 25 October 2012)
Zero air and the calibration gases are measured and
compared and, ideally, the readings on the front of
the monitor should be the same as the measure in the
gas canisters. Looking for this `span and drift' in a
calibration test means waiting for the reaction to take
place and a stable measurement to be made­both of
zero air and the calibration gases.5 Phil has to wait at
least ten minutes in order for the analyser (the name
used to refer to the piece of equipment that makes the
measurement) to stabilise:
As the numbers on the front of the monitor start to
slow down, Phil tells me that the display on the front of
the monitor box is the `zero reading'. Phil types this
into the spreadsheet under the table `data acquisition
response'. (Fieldnotes, 25 October 2012)
Once stabilised, the readings are formally recorded
on a shared spreadsheet, which also operational-
ises the numerical readings in a series of further trans-
formations, `because Excel is also a calculating tool'
(Phil, 25 October 2012). The readings of zero and
that of the calibration gas are compared by a mathem-
atical equation, which then provides a measure
of `error'.
The process of reading and interpreting the sequence
of numbers that stabilises as measurements are, as
explained Phil, contingent on the pollutant being mea-
sured. So, for example, the calibration of ozone
requires checking another nearby monitoring station
to see if it is similar, as ozone is stable over a regional
area. However, particulate matter (pm2.5
and pm10
)

would not generate a stable reading, since particulates
are unstable in space and time:
I asked Phil how he knew what the numbers meant.
He responded by explaining that meaning comes
from `experience [. . .] you need an eye to know
what to look for'. Expanding on this notion of
experience, Phil suggests there is an embodied
aspect of doing this kind of work, through which
someone can develop `a good eye'. (Fieldnotes, 25
October 2012)
The experience of carrying out calibration tests, then,
enables one to `know what to look for', drawing upon
the age old distinction between seeing and knowing
(Lynch and Woolgar, 1990), and exemplifies the sym-
biotic relationship and circulatory nature of seeing and
knowing in practice (see also Latour, 1999a). As Myers
(2014) develops in her account of protein modellers, the
work of seeing and knowing extends beyond vision to
the embodied, kinaesthetic and performative processes
of coming to materialise scientific phenomena. Indeed,
Phil went on to compare his own experience of seeing
and thereby getting `good data' with `non-data ana-
lysers' (specifically individuals employed by local
authorities and inexperienced technicians) as people
who `don't know what to look for', and who have
not developed the necessary craft skills to re-present
phenomena in ways that make data of a high enough
quality.
Cleaning and mobilising air pollution data
Whilst running the calibration test, Phil balanced his
laptop on his knees and opened up the spreadsheet
ready to input the recordings he made. The mainten-
ance of the record of measurements taken and calibra-
tion results was the second major task of visiting the
site, which Phil explicitly referred to as `a record keep-
ing exercise'. The spreadsheet is a table which structures
the measurements, with a list of variables including the
name of the monitoring site, the date, time, temperature
in the cabin, and the calibration results. These records
go straight into a database:
Constant data is the aim and records of calibration
results are kept and put into the database for the time
period [. . .] and you scale it [the data from the monitor]
until the next time someone comes to the site [according
to the calibration results of this visit]. (Fieldnotes,
25 October 2012; technicalities confirmed via email,
30 October 2012)
The calibration results then become attached to the
measurements made by the monitor, so that future
data analysis can draw upon the results to check and
explain the measurements made and make any adjust-
ments required.
The cleaning procedures for air pollution data are
governed by standardised protocols and related thresh-
olds of validity according to UK and EU legislation, so
that the data become further shaped and formatted by
influences from outside the situation of initial capture
(Helgesson, 2010: 61). The cleaning practices are rec-
orded, maintained and sustained and become part of
the history of air pollution monitoring. Indeed, during
the site visit, Phil emphasised the importance of main-
taining the records for `data capture' and the proceed-
ing journey of these captures to their stabilisation as
`ratified data'.
Continuity is also a useful metaphor to think ana-
lytically about this process of getting `good data'. Air
pollution was conceptualised by Phil as something that
is always in emergence and therefore continuous.
However, continuity is difficult to measure in practice
and one of the ways in which continuity was con-
structed was through checking for errors and maintain-
ing the material context of measurement, which
remained identifiable and attached to numerical read-
ings in their journey to becoming data.6 Constructing
continuity by making lots of different kinds of meas-
urements ­ of humidity, of instrument performance, of
date and time ­ enabled the data to become `more real'.
This is a logic which resonates with claims made in
contemporary discourse about Big Data and reality
(Grant, 2012; Shaw, 2014). In the case of air pollution
data, in order to make data continuous and `big', a
series of interferences were required to construct this
sense of `the real'. The way in which data were made
real, however, was specific to the particular pollutant
monitored.
The standardised procedures of reducing and
accounting for error, through which monitored data
became more stable, simultaneously mobilised data
into different practices. For example, the London Air
Quality Network publishes data in `real time' on their
website and these are then classified according to low,
medium or high air pollution levels. In this movement
from measurement practices to the practices that work
with and re-use these data, data become an objectified
form, from which claims can be made and further epi-
stemic inquiries initiated. By providing discrete meas-
urements every 15 seconds, monitoring enables the
potential extension of scientific relations and analytical
patterns of air pollution. This process is a component
of making Big Data and, although not defined as such
by Phil, the checking of error and stabilising of accurate
data is informed by its functionality, as making up
larger data sets for controlling and responding to air
quality and urban environments.

Case study 2: Running a simulation and
checking for error
The modeller states `see, there is an error' pointing to
the computer screen where, after several seconds, a
series of numbers appear. However, I can't see the
error. Following this apparent visualisation of error
the modeller describes how he is going to now seek to
understand this error, explaining that the compilation
of code is tricky because if it is compiled on one com-
puter then it won't necessarily work on another, so by
re-running the model you start to work out where the
error lies and therefore what counts as data.
(Fieldnotes, 28 September 2012)
Modelling involves a different kind of measurement
setting and data practice to monitoring. At the same
time, I found there were strong resonances between
these practices. In modelling, the measurement setting
was built with a computer, and the complexities that
make up environments, such as temperature, weather
conditions and time, were constructed within the
model structure. This approach contrasts with moni-
toring, where the complexities in taking a measure-
ment influence the setting in which a monitor is
initially located. In order, for example, to measure
traffic pollution monitors are placed on `the roadside';
for `ambient air'7 monitors are located away from
traffic to pick up `background air'. Furthermore, the
process of deciding which interactions to study was
the subject of continuing debate among the modellers
and other researchers on WHAP. So, the process of
producing air pollution data was worked out contin-
gently in modelling ­ as a result of particular research
interests and in relation to the aims of the wider pro-
ject ­ rather than as the result of a standardised
system of data collection.
A simulation model is often considered a theoretical
representation of the atmosphere. The assumptions
that underpin the model are described through math-
ematical equations. The combined model, of the wea-
ther and atmosphere, simulates atmospheric relations
in process by reducing chemical processes to a
number of physical laws and by inputting other data
for specific variables that function as parameters for the
running of a simulation. These equations represent an
`exact determination of how the [environmental] system
will evolve through time' (Winsburg, 1999: 5), so that
the actual simulation process is internal to the com-
puter model.
The modellers on WHAP talked about the model as
three dimensional, simulating the fluxes, flows and
transport of air pollution rather than measuring air
pollution at one point in time and space like monitors.8
So, even though the model can simulate a number of
different pollutants, including ozone and particulate
matter, these were considered to be relational and in
process. The different pollutants were referred to by
the modellers as relations in the atmosphere, for exam-
ple, as `nitrogen and sulphur deposition' or `surface
ozone'. This is significant if we are to understand how
modelling transforms a measurement into data, because
how air pollution is configured and imagined in time
and space shapes the stabilisation process.
The policy value of modelling is its ability to produce
data on past, present and future air pollution, which
can be used in environmental governance and policy
making. At the same time, this feedback between data
and use plays out in the making of data. As one senior
modeller explained, which simulations to run is depend-
ent on the pollutants considered as a health risk and
therefore of interest to the policy maker (Elizabeth,
November 2011).
A simulation run
I am sharing an office space with Craig and Tom and
observing their running a simulation. I am surprised to
find a simple and rather ordinary setting, an office very
much like my own, considering the global remit of the
CM-MW model. It seems to be time consuming. I learn
that modelling relies on access to external expertise and
technical resources, specifically, the model interface of
the PC is connected to a super computer, which Craig
can communicate with at his office computer.9 On the
screen are lines of code, and below a box that Craig
begins to type commands for the model into.
(Fieldnotes, 8 November 2012)
The process of working out error in a simulation run
was a key component of the practice of running a simu-
lation, where there was an alteration between the com-
puter screen as interface and the mathematical model
accessed through the computer code. The computer
screen became the material way in which the researcher
engaged with air pollution as a digital abstraction. By
typing out particular commands in the box on the
screen, Craig manipulated the modelled atmosphere
to produce a measurement of an air pollutant.
Communicating with the model through computer
code was an engagement that made the model do
things:
The core model code provided by the model developers
is modified for the specific needs of the project [WHAP]
by manually editing via the keyboard. This human
readable `source code' is then `compiled' via a standard
software tool (compiler) into a set of binary instruc-
tions which can be understood and executed by the
Garnett 7
computer. (Craig, personal correspondence, 19
December 2013)
The next step, compiling, translated the line of code
into a series of actions. Compiling is an action con-
sidered as potentially generating error because how
the code comes together and performs in practice is
uncertain. The line of code was translated by the
model into a series of actions, which then performed
a simulation according to the specific parameters deli-
neated: `to execute the sequence of instructions created
by the compile stage'. The instructions in the code
order the variables of interest (e.g., which pollutant,
meteorological conditions, location) into output files
that are structured and stored under the details of the
simulation run (see Figure 2). The arrangements of the
output data into files results from a successful simula-
tion run. This process of arranging output and input
files and its effect on materialising some output over
others resonates with Bowker et al.'s (1995) arguments
around knowledge infrastructures. It is this work of
structuring and storing data files, of encoding and clas-
sifying modelled outputs, which are made visible in
practice based accounts of data. These organising tech-
niques ultimately influence the informational content
and material form air pollution data take.
Checking for error, configuring air pollution
The arrangements of the output data into files results
from a successful simulation run. However, the major-
ity of runs involve error. Craig's demonstration of a
simulation run showed me what error means in
practice, and how it is visualised on the computer
interface:
Having pressed `run' on the computer interface, we
wait about ten seconds for a series of lines of code,
similar visually to my untrained eye, as the code that
was input into the model. This is because the model
output is also in code. The model presents a result
in the response box above the command box on the
interface that Craig sits in front of. (Fieldnotes,
28 September 2012)
There is error if the code does not produce a `legible
output', appearing as a line of script within which the
error lies and needs to be worked out. The line of script
becomes the object of interest. `De-bugging' is an
exercise in trying to understand the sources of error
by re-examining the different elements of a model
run. Primarily, this involves going back to the typed-
in code commands. Indeed, there are a number of
recognised sources of error in the data. There may be
error in the performance of the code in a compilation;
there may be error in the assumptions within the code,
for example, the approximated measurement by those
who wrote the code not co-ordinating with the approxi-
mation of measurement being produced in the simula-
tion; or `human error' in the process of re-writing the
code for the particular compilation. These different
kinds of sources of error were found, understood and
controlled for through a series of interactions at the
model interface.

8 Big Data & Society
In Craig's account, checking for error seemed to be a
process of getting a sense for the balance of the model
as a good representation of the atmosphere, the code as
the means by which the computer and modeller can
communicate, and the assumptions behind the data
used as inputs into the model. Craig described this act
of generating data an `art', of balancing the different
elements comprising the modelled atmosphere, along-
side an understanding of what kinds of air pollution
relations are of interest to those using the data.10 This
empirical anecdote extends what counts as error
because it is through achieving balance, and the feeling
for work that is required to do this, that `good data' is
made. Here, error free data is neither a classification
nor a scale but an enactment, as Sennett suggests, a
making of new possibilities (2009: 205). In this way,
modelling was not simply a process of getting a good
representation of the atmosphere, but an engagement
that plays with atmospheric relations in ways that
shape how air pollution in the atmosphere came to be
known and performed.
At a different scale, then, the modelled generation of
big, national scale data of air pollution is not unprob-
lematic either. Modelled data of air pollution was also
subject to the effects and affects of mundane, everyday
data practices. Once the modelled outputs were made
legible (but not stabilised data), they were read using
open source software, which is an aid for analysing data
through visualisation as mapped concentrations (see
Figure 3). The mapped outputs were then used to
hone and develop the simulation run in ways which
would make data more accurate. Like in the calibration
test, this shift back to the technical arrangements of the
measurement setting by Craig was where the `tinkering'
(Knorr-Cetina, 1981) took place, so that Craig's
engagement with the atmosphere in the building, run-
ning and re-running of model simulations intervened in
the articulation of air pollution by making particular
atmospheric relations `more visible'. Error was a fun-
damental part of making `good data', a process through
which what counted as good/ bad data shaped how air
pollution was ultimately stabilised and made real.
Discussion: The role of error in
the making of air pollution data
The proliferation of environmental data poses a chan-
ging set of inquiries for those studying scientific prac-
tices and knowledge making. If we are going to study
data practices as a particular way of doing science, then
the ways in which these practices articulate phenomena,
and how researchers sense and enact data in different
ways, need to be explored at the multiple sites where
these transformations take place. The ethnographic
account of air pollution data offered in this paper is
an attempt to consider how data emerge as a result of
one kind of transformation, that of a purification of
data through the working out of error. In doing so,
the affordances embedded in different kinds of data
and how these relate to the scientific and policy
worlds in which they are made and used were explored.
For Phil and Craig, making stable data was achieved
through carefully balancing the context of measure-
ment, the phenomena under study and their ability to
effect and affect air pollution as a research object.
Making data was not unmediated or discrete
(Bowker, 2010), but rather a process that unfolded tem-
porally through interaction between the phenomena in
question, technical objects and other scientific values.
Checking a measurement for error was routine practice,
yet it was also an inherently uncertain and ambiguous
process, which involved practices of feeling for error in
order to both get a sense for, and make sense of, air
pollution as data; a practice that didn't simply repre-
sent, but materialised air pollution as a tangible form.
Model and monitor devices were engaged with in ways
which made visible particular and contingent relations
of air pollution as data.
This process of stabilising accurate and useable data
of air pollution involved sensing for error, where error
became the focus of investigation and the materialised
relation from which air pollution could emerge and

trations (Craig, personal correspondence, 15 January 2015).

take form. I have shown that in monitoring and mod-
elling, what counted as error was shaped by contingent
logics of functionality and framing. In monitoring,
omissions were used to further fabricate and make
accurate the final data. In modelling, error was used
to re-configure the very measurement process, therefore
operating differently to monitoring in its entanglement
within data making rather than the final data.
Developing a feeling for the relational inter-dependen-
cies of making data was both a honing of professional
vision (Goodwin, 1994) and the craftwork of articulat-
ing and managing error. Performance of error was also
influenced by the social and political networks of mod-
elling and monitoring air pollution. For example,
monitored data is used in everyday public health man-
agement, and error is constantly made and taken away
to make data instantly useable and verifiable. In mod-
elling, error is checked for and then taken away by
restructuring the measurement process (a simulation).
Rather than a scale of an acceptable range of error in
data (how far the measurement errs from `the truth'), in
modelling error is an enactment that, as Sennett notes,
involves working with error and thereby reconfiguring
the problem into other terms (2009: 222), generating
new articulations of atmospheric relations and thereby
allowing new kinds of questions to be posed.
Exploring these particular roles and artefacts of
error extends our understanding of the social and pol-
itical lives of data. It is through measuring and account-
ing for error that data's validity was made and
mobilised. I have demonstrated the ways in which
data are always shifting, demanding flexibility and
local ordering (Bowker, 2010; Edwards et al., 2011).
In doing so, I have also pointed out that an important
part of this alignment process is the performance, man-
agement and taking away of error. Thus, starting out
with the premise that data are always situated, material
enactments is productive in coming to understand the
social and political dimensions of data, and the ways in
which data gain social and political validity as Big Data
(Gabrys et al., 2016).
I've shown that the experienced multiplicity and het-
erogeneity involved in stabilising what comes to count
as `real data' are constantly negotiated by those scien-
tists and technicians who craft and `make up' data.
Indeed, it was researchers' articulation of their embo-
died work that also enabled me, as an ethnographer, to
get a feeling for the multiple agencies mobilised in
measurement practices. Like Myers, I have emphasised
the sensory dimensions of feeling for error and the sen-
sibilities which configure these so that they become
sensible and useable data. Error practices mobilise het-
erogeneous elements which give air relations both their
sensitivity ­ ability to respond to intervening practices ­
and their sensibility ­ to endow them with a kind of
responsivity that can be used to make sense of their
worlds (Myers, 2015a). It is these different kinds of
sensing practices and the attentiveness demonstrated
by scientists in my research that are made active in
the accounts of error provided in this paper, and
which highlight how valid data are made accountable
to their relations, thereby becoming valid and `sensible'.
It is through error, then, that we can better understand
the multiple agencies which configure different versions
of air pollution in practice.
As Tilly (1996) and Sennett (2009) both point out,
accounting for errors and ambiguity in everyday prac-
tices is fundamental to the maintenance of social
(and socio-technical) relations and to the extension of
knowledge (embodied, material and informational).
This relationship between error and social and political
networks is of particular significance if we are to under-
stand and trace the expanse and extent of relations
which form the social lives of scientific data, and
indeed Big Data. Starting out with case studies of
data practices of air pollution, I've also problematised
the focus on `data' in discourses of Big Data by fore-
grounding the other kinds of relations which configure
and contain data. I've demonstrated the ways in which
performative work of data making always involves
materialising and accounting for error, a practice vital
for data to carry meaning, circulate freely and mobilise
as informational forms.

Notes
1. WHAP involved researchers from five different UK uni-
versities, and these were largely split across two large cities
in the UK ­ City 1 and 2.
2. Where monitors are placed relates to the character of the
surrounding environment. Monitor locations are then
10 Big Data & Society
classified according to these surroundings. The classifica-
tions `urban background' and `rural background' signify
that the monitor is measuring the lowest levels of air
pollution in that surrounding area. In contrast, `road-
side' denotes a point which is considered as having high
levels of air pollution, but which is not considered as
`representative' of the wider area.
3. The Automatic Urban Rural Network monitoring sta-
tions can also measure carbon monoxide and smaller par-
ticulate matter, pm2.5.
4. `Real-time' is not actually real time in the sense that there
is a delay in the capture of air and the stabilisation of a
measurement.
5. In a manual calibration test this means the certified gases
in the canisters, rather than a sample of ambient air.
6. Sabina Leonelli's (2009) analysis of the journeys of data
and the ways in which data get enrolled in order to make
scientific claims suggests that data remain very much
attached to their site of locution.
7. Ambient air quality refers to the quality of outdoor air in
our surrounding environment, usually at ground level
and away from direct sources of pollution.
8. The simulation model in WHAP was a combined chem-
istry transport model (CM) and meteorological model
(WM). This CM-WM was used to simulate the concen-
tration and movement of air pollutants in the atmo-
sphere, generating three hourly description (by
mathematical equation) of the evolution of the dependent
variables (the parameters and boundary values) of the
model (Project Protocol).
9. Super computers are able to carry out a very high amount
of computation, and are used for working with very large
data sets. The super computer used by the modellers at
the university was based in a research institute close by,
but every year it moves between prestigious scientific
institutions.
10. This kind of balance between the scientific error and the
requirements of particular kinds of data as a result of the
research project point to another potential error.
Although I have not detailed those tensions between sci-
entific requirements of simulation modelling and the
demands of, specifically, epidemiologists on WHAP,
there were continual discussions about how to match the-
oretical correctness with the need for a certain scale of
empirical data.
