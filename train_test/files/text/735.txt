The idea of a long and stable career rewarded by retirement is a fixture of the American social ethos and political
economy. The paradox is that many Americans' careers do not fit this image. Here, we examined how the structure
of the career, as compared to only those circumstances proximate to retirement, is importantfor understanding ca-
reer endings. Based on labor force histories drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men, we ob-
served that the occupational roles held through the mid and late career combine additively to influence retirement
and disability experiences, with different conditions of work coming into play depending on the career stage. Occu-
pational roles in the mid career also have long-term, indirect effects, operating through the onset of health prob-
lems and the adequacy of pension benefits. Although retirement and disability are not hinged to occupational mo-
bility per se, these career endings are sensitive to major discontinuities in the career and work role in terms of
unemployment and laborforce mobility.
TI ^HE idea of a long and stable career rewarded by retire-
X ment is a fixture of the American social ethos and polit-
ical economy. Individuals regard retirement as a right or
natural consequence of a lifetime of work commitment.
Private pension systems, especially guaranteed benefit
plans, reinforce this belief by rewarding employment
tenure. Social Security pension benefits also reward stable
careers, basing benefit levels on earnings from contiguous
quarters of labor force participation. The fact that retire-
ment is regarded as a natural part of the career is due in
part to the mutual advantages that workers, employers, and
the state accrue through lower turnover (and its costs) and
increased productivity by workers.
The paradox is that the work careers of many Americans
do not fit this image. Over their careers, workers frequently
change jobs both within and between firms (e.g., DiPrete &
Krecker, 1991). A significant number of Americans also ex-
perience unemployment at some point in their work lives
(Hachen, 1992; Siegel, 1993). Workers experience both
losses and gains in the circumstances and rewards associ-
ated with their jobs (e.g., Blau & Duncan, 1967; Tolbert,
1982). Although these experiences are age-patterned with
substantially greater mobility occurring early in the career,
mobility remains an important aspect of the career even
among middle-aged and older workers (e.g., Spenner,
1988a; Tolbert, 1982).
This discrepancy between the ideal career and many
Americans' experiences points to the important role the
work career has in producing variation in the timing and
character of the work-to-retirement transition. Here, we in-
vestigate the alternative ways in which work careers poten-
tially influence career endings. Special attention is given to
the trajectories of occupational incumbency and career mo-
bility. As we demonstrate below, career endings are linked
both to the patterning of occupational roles held over the
career and to major discontinuities in the work role. Trajec-
tories indicative of career advancement magnify ties to the
labor force, reducing retirement chances. Conversely, tra-
jectories showing low levels of attainment weaken workers'
bonds to the labor force, increasing retirement chances.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
How careers end and the timing of career endings are a
reflection of the stratification of occupational achievement
(Hayward, Grady, Hardy, & Sommers, 1989; Hayward,
Hardy, & Liu, 1994). Jobs with little autonomy, mundane
work tasks, and high physical demands propel workers out
of the labor force through retirement and disability. The
disruption of the work role through unemployment hastens
the end of the work career. These late-life work circum-
stances index the attractiveness of continued work activity
and the demand for older workers. It is axiomatic, however,
that older workers are rarely "born into" those positions
held late in life. For most workers, these positions are the
outcomes of a lifetime of career achievement. The general
question for this study is whether only the person's current
work circumstances are relevant to predict retirement be-
havior, or whether retirement also is sensitive to earlier ca-
reer experiences and thus patterned by both current and
earlier work circumstances. If the latter is true, then knowl-
edge of the structure of careers is important for understand-
ing retirement.
Although most prior research has focused on contextual-
izing career endings in terms of late-life work circum-
stances, there are both substantive and theoretical reasons
to suspect more far-reaching career effects. For example,
empirical evidence contradicts the commonly held notion
that older workers experience little career mobility. Among
a sample of men aged 55-59 during the 1966-1981 period,
over 20% changed employers and approximately 35%
changed occupations. Of those who changed occupations,
the proportions moving upward and downward in terms of
occupational status were roughly equal (Tolbert, 1982).
This same pattern holds at a highly aggregate level. At least
S91
S92 HAYWARD ETAL
a quarter of older incumbents in 1-digit census occupational
categories moved to other occupations. The volume of
movement ranged from 29% of professionals to 54% of
nonfarm laborers (Parnes & Less, 1985). The key lessons
for this study are that (a) there is considerable variation in
the age-vulnerability of careers, and (b) older workers are
heterogeneous in terms of how they arrived in their occupa-
tional positions. To show that retirement differs by current
occupation is no guarantee that retirement is in fact
prompted by the immediate work environment. The full
consequences of occupational achievement must be sought
by tracing the effects of occupational positions held through-
out the career (Elder & Pavalko, 1993).
Neither prior research nor current theory provides a clear
standard of how to model the effects of a career on retire-
ment behavior. We approach the development of a theoreti-
cal framework with several goals in mind. First, it is impor-
tant to identify the effects of specific qualities of the work
career to understand the mechanisms connecting career
endings with career achievement. Second, given the dynam-
ics of careers, it is important to separate the effects of the
immediate work environment from prior circumstances to
assess whether one or both influences retirement. Third, it
is necessary to consider how occupational positions com-
bine over the career to influence career endings.
These goals are rooted in Spilerman's (1977) definition
of a career. Individuals' career achievements are deter-
mined, in part, by career lines, the properties of which in-
clude entry portals, number of available positions, and
transfer opportunities to better (or worse) jobs or alternative
career lines. These properties are age-patterned, which ac-
counts for the sequence of jobs individuals hold over the
career. These sequences, in turn, determine career trajecto-
ries of job qualities and rewards. Comparisons of job quali-
ties for different points in the career can be used to make
inferences about career advancement or unraveling.
Traditionally, career achievement has been indexed by
sociologists in terms of occupational status. In studying the
consequences of occupational position for individuals,
however, the use of a single global measure such as occupa-
tional status does not lend itself to sorting out the mecha-
nisms by which the achievement of social positions affects
some outcome such as retirement. This study follows the
research tradition of Kohn and Schooler (e.g., 1983) and
adopts the premise that the structural conditions of work
rather than the status assigned to work mediate the effects
of social position on retirement. Phrased in terms of the re-
search problem stated above, retirement is hypothesized to
be an outcome of the career trajectory where the trajectory
references the conditions of work over the career.
The conditions of the work environment are referenced
in terms of structural imperatives (i.e., factors defining the
day-to-day qualities of work activity; Kohn & Schooler,
1983; Spenner, 1988b, p. 72). These imperatives include
(a) occupational self-direction (e.g., the substantive com-
plexity of work, closeness of supervision, and routiniza-
tion); (b) job pressures (e.g., strength demands and environ-
mental conditions); (c) extrinsic rewards and risks (e.g., the
risk of unemployment, employment regulations, and earn-
ings); and (d) position in the organizational structure (e.g.,
ownership, and supervisory status). All four dimensions of
the work environment have been linked to the retirement
process (e.g., Hayward et al., 1989). Retirement rates are
elevated for persons in jobs with low self-direction (e.g.,
jobs with low levels of complexity, authority and high lev-
els of routinization) and considerable job pressures (e.g.,
jobs which are physically and environmentally demanding).
Retirement also is affected by the job's extrinsic rewards
and risks (e.g., generous pension benefits and compulsory
retirement regulations increase retirement rates) and posi-
tion in the organizational structure (e.g., retirement rates are
low among self-employed persons compared to persons
working in larger bureaucratized firms). Retirement is em-
bedded in the organization of work. Here, we amend this
idea by inserting temporal structure into the relationship.
We consider how retirement is embedded in the organiza-
tion of work over the career.
Although little research has examined career effects on
retirement (an important exception is the work of Elder &
Pavalko, 1993), related research suggests that occupational
positions in both mid and late life influence career endings,
with different structural imperatives coming into play de-
pending on the career stage. This body of research suggests,
for example, that imperatives such as substantive complex-
ity and physical and environmental demands have the great-
est effect in the later stages of the career (e.g., Spenner,
1988a), whereas mid career effects accrue from the job's
extrinsic rewards and risks and position in the organiza-
tional structure (e.g., Mutran & Reitzes, 1989; Quinn,
Burkhauser, & Myers, 1990; Ruhm, 1991).
The importance for retirement of structural imperatives
experienced in the late career is based partly on the empiri-
cal observation that some work conditions, especially con-
ditions reflecting the substantive complexity of work and
job pressures, show increased variability in the mid to late
career as workers continue to be sorted (or sort themselves)
into jobs. As variability in substantive complexity occurs
over the career, for example, so do the opportunities for
adult intellectual and personal development (Spenner,
1988a). Substantively complex environments provide older
workers with the opportunities to practice or exercise their
intellectual abilities. Practice in later life generates greater
benefits in terms of maintaining one's level of ability com-
pared to younger ages (i.e., the lack of exercise is more
harmful at older ages). Retirement-aged workers in substan-
tively complex jobs thus are more likely to maintain their
intellectual abilities and interests in their jobs compared to
same aged workers in less complex jobs, accentuating oc-
cupational differences in both the value of older workers to
employers and older workers' own evaluation of work and
non-work alternatives. The strongest effects of substantive
complexity on retirement, therefore, should come from
those jobs held as persons move into the prime retirement
ages. We also expect that the physical and environmental
demands from jobs held late in the career are likely to ele-
vate retirement. Workers' age-related declines in health are
likely to magnify the challenges of these job pressures.
We expect that the structural imperatives of mid career
occupations operate principally through the traditional ex-
planatory factors of retirement: health status and pension
CAREER TRAJECTORIES AND OLDER MEN'S RETIREMENT S93
characteristics. Health is sensitive to working conditions
such as substantive complexity and physical and environ-
mental demands. Occupations lacking complexity or char-
acterized by high levels of job stress have higher rates of
mortality (Moore & Hayward, 1990) and heart disease
(e.g., Karasek, Theorell, & Schwartz, 1988; Karasek,
1990). Greater physical and environmental demands also
elevate the chances of mortality (Behrman, Sickles, &
Taubman, 1990; Moore & Hayward, 1990), musculoskele-
tal disorders and impaired working capacity (Ostlin, 1988),
and heart disease (Johnson, Hall, & Theorell, 1989;
Karasek et al., 1988). The long-term consequences of these
working conditions, then, may be health-mandated career
exits at older ages.
Workers' retirement pensions stem from extrinsic rewards
and risks and the worker's position in the organizational
structure (O'Rand, 1986; O'Rand & MacLean, 1986). Ex-
trinsic rewards and risks include the chances of unemploy-
ment, employment rules and regulations, and earnings. Over
the course of the career, extrinsic rewards and risks give rise
to earnings trajectories and job tenure. Earnings trajectories
influence pension benefit levels, and job tenure governs pri-
vate pension eligibility. Illustrative of positional effects is
the contrast in pension wealth stemming from careers devel-
oped inside and outside large bureaucratic firms. Bureau-
cratic firms are capable of supporting private pension pro-
grams. Self-employed persons, in contrast, bear the brunt of
accumulating private pension wealth through personal sav-
ings and higher Social Security taxes because there is no
employer contribution. This latter factor negatively affects
private pension wealth by constraining discretionary sav-
ings. Self-employment over the major part of the career
therefore is likely to delay retirement.
The dynamic quality of the career makes it important to
consider how career endings are related to trajectories in-
dicative of a bettering or worsening of working conditions
(Elder & Pavalko, 1993). Careers can unravel through job
loss or a worsening of working conditions through down-
ward occupational mobility. Career building can occur via
improvements in working conditions. Career unraveling at
older ages is expected to reduce older workers' preference
for continued work, especially given the availability of re-
tirement options defined by public and private pension sys-
tems. Career building at older ages is expected to have the
opposite effect. Here, an improvement in working condi-
tions is likely to heighten older workers' preference for
continued work, although there are clearly diminishing re-
turns with age.
Occupational moves denoting a worsening of work condi-
tions thus are expected in increased retirement rates, whereas
moves to better working conditions are expected to have the
opposite effect. The greater the magnitude of change in
working conditions, ceteris paribus, the greater the impact on
retirement rates. For example, moves resulting in less self-
direction and greater pressures are expected to increase the
risk of retirement, net of an individual's position, since such
moves potentially signal career unraveling. We also consider
the possibility that events signaling unraveling may influ-
ence retirement indirectly by impairing health status and re-
ducing access to and/or the real value of pensions.
DATA AND VARIABLES
This study is a cohort-based prospective analysis of the
National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of Older Men. The
NLS is a nationally representative sample of men aged
45-59 in 1966 (N = 5,020) interviewed annually or bienni-
ally until 1983. The NLS was designed to map the labor
force experiences of middle-aged men as they entered the
prime retirement ages. The 1966-1983 observation period
spans an important period in retirement research. Although
most of the post-WWII decline in men's labor force partici-
pation rates occurred prior to this period (Hayward, Crim-
mins, & Wray, 1994; Tuma & Sandefur, 1988), the organi-
zation of the retirement transition underwent significant
changes. Retirement rates escalated as did reentry rates,
causing a contraction in the main career and an expansion
of post-retirement labor force activity for both men and
women (Hayward, Crimmins, & Wray, 1994; Hayward,
Grady, & McLaughlin, 1988a, 1988b). These organizational
changes were prompted in part by the liberalization of pub-
lic and private pension plans and the increased respectabil-
ity of retirement in the population (Parnes & Less, 1985),
general conditions that remain part of the fabric of today's
retirement decision making.
On entering this period, 34% of the NLS cohort identi-
fied a white-collar occupation as their longest job (Parnes
& Less, 1985, p. 14). The bulk of the cohort's long-term
employment at this point was concentrated in craft and la-
borer occupations, 24 and 20% respectively, with 13% of
the cohort reporting farm occupations as their longest job.
This latter estimate of farm employment as the longest job
is doubtlessly unique to this cohort compared to more re-
cent cohorts given the long-term historical decline in farm
employment over this century. Very little change occurred
in employment mobility as the cohort moved through the
1970s and into the 1980s despite both economic boom and
bust cycles--as noted above roughly 80% of men aged
55-59 years reported working with the same employer at
the beginning and end of three 5-year intervals spanning the
observation period (Parnes & Less, 1985, p. 18). Somewhat
higher volumes of occupational mobility were reported for
these ages, though occupational stability over a 5-year in-
terval declined only marginally from 63 to 59%. Despite
both improvements and declines in occupational status by
individuals over the observation period, overall levels of oc-
cupational upgrading continued as the cohort entered the
prime retirement years. Particularly evident was the growth
of men working in managerial occupations among white-
collar workers, the heavy decline in farm employment with
the dispersal of workers into other blue-collar jobs, and the
growth of service employment fueled by men leaving oper-
ative and laborer occupations.
The NLS cohort is unique in at least one other important
respect compared to current and future cohorts of persons
facing retirement. During most of the observation period,
relatively few older women had lifelong work careers, and
those women who did were concentrated in a handful of oc-
cupations. The NLS men's retirement decisions, therefore,
are more typically framed in terms of "his" labor market
experiences and rewards rather than some combination of
husbands' and wives' characteristics. Among the more re-
S94 HAYWARD ETAL
cent cohorts of workers approaching retirement, however,
women's greater access to private pensions and a higher
prevalence of lifelong work careers has elevated both the
importance of considering women's retirement in its own
right and the imperative of framing both men's and wom-
en's retirement decisions within the larger context of the
household (e.g., Henretta, O'Rand, & Chan, 1993).
The analysis here rests on the subsample of men ob-
served to be in the labor force at some point during the 17-
year observation period. This restriction allows us to accu-
rately identify the "at risk" population and to establish
covariate values temporally prior to exiting the labor force.
Those men in 1966 not in the labor force and who never
reenter are excluded from this analysis. Histories of labor
force behavior are constructed based on men's movements
out of, and perhaps back into, the labor force over the ob-
servation period. Should individuals exit and then reenter
the labor force, they rejoin the retirement risk set. An indi-
vidual's history ends at the age at which he left the survey
either through death or attrition. The histories are compiled
into an exposure interval file where the interval is one year
in length. All exposure intervals are defined such that indi-
viduals are on average exact age x (e.g., 62.0) at the begin-
ning of an interval, and events (including censoring) are as-
sumed to occur in the middle of the interval. Censoring
refers to individuals in the risk set who leave observation
because of sample attrition or death prior to being observed
to exit the labor force. In all, the subsample generated
41,356 exposure intervals of observation.
The work-to-retirement experiences of workers are de-
fined in terms of changes in labor force status over the 1-
year exposure interval. The NLS allows us to determine the
age at which persons exited the labor force and whether the
exit was mandated by the inability to work (i.e., disability).
Persons employed or looking for work in the survey week
are classified as being "in the labor force." Persons not cur-
rently working and not looking for work are classified as
being "out of the labor force." Disability is based on re-
spondents' reports that they are unable to work for health
reasons. Nondisabled persons out of the labor force are la-
beled heuristically as retired.
The operational definition of retirement is an unsettled
issue (Ekerdt & DeViney, 1990). An alternative approach is
to use self-identification (e.g., do individuals define them-
selves as retired?), although this sometimes confuses labor
supply with a social identity. In addition to labor force exit
and self-identification, other possible criteria include pen-
sion receipt, separation from a career job, and reduced
work effort. Cross-classification on these criteria shows
considerable overlap among men--though no comparable
analyses are available for women (e.g., 75-85% of men are
consistently classified across multiple criteria), and alterna-
tive definitions typically have no effect on the substantive
results (e.g., Diamond & Hausman, 1984; Palmore,
Burchett, Fillenbaum, George, & Wallman, 1985). Multiple
criteria are sometimes used to define retirement status.
However, multiple criteria introduce difficulties in making
inferences about when events happen because criteria need
not share the same temporal paths. Here, our reliance on
labor force status in combination with the inability to work
provides the means to identify the cessation of work. Infor-
mation on part-time work and prior labor force exits are in-
cluded as explanatory covariates to link exiting events with
reduced work effort and labor force mobility.
The total number of retirement and disability events in
our sample is 3,632 and 491, respectively. Because of miss-
ing data, the number of events in the analysis reduces to
3,564 retirements and 462 disability exits. The problems of
missing data are minimized largely by imputing missing
values using a hot deck imputation routine. Procedures are
described in detail in Moore and Hayward (1990). Despite
using an imputation procedure, some missing data still re-
sulted because of an insufficient number of cases with valid
values matching the characteristics of the missing case.
A disproportionate share of retirement and disability
exits are single career ending events. Of all the retirement
events, approximately 74% reference the only retirement
event in a person's life (although substantial numbers of re-
tirees reenter the labor force and perhaps exit through death
or disability); 95% of disability exits reference the only dis-
ability event.
The distinction between retirement and disability as rea-
sons for exiting the labor force is important for several rea-
sons. First, disability explicitly references health-mandated
labor force exits, (i.e., persons report being unable to work
for health-related reasons), and is thus a largely involun-
tary act. Although health status may prompt a person to re-
tire (e.g., Hayward et al., 1989), the retiree, unlike a dis-
abled worker, is nonetheless capable of working. Second,
and related to this first point, different processes govern
these events (e.g., Hayward et al., 1989). A range of fac-
tors influence the retirement decision including occupa-
tion, health status, pension wealth, income, education, and
self-employment. A much narrower set of factors directly
influences disability (e.g., health status and income) with
the occupational position held proximate to disability only
playing a major role indirectly through an individual's
wages (Hayward et al., 1989).
The longitudinal quality of the NLS makes it possible to
characterize career mobility during the later stages of the
career, since information on occupation, unemployment,
and employer changes is collected at each observation
wave. Information about the longest job (e.g., occupation
and tenure) and the first job after the completion of school
also, is available at baseline, providing markers of achieve-
ment spanning the entire career. The NLS contains items
measuring the traditional determinants of retirement such
as financial information, health, pension coverage, and de-
mographic characteristics. Table 1 shows the variables used
in the analysis.
The fourth edition of the Dictionary of Occupational Ti-
tles (DOT) is used to measure the nature of work in the oc-
cupation. The DOT is the major source of information re-
garding the nature of jobs in the U.S. The DOT provides
measures of 46 characteristics on training time, aptitudes,
interests, physical demands, working conditions, industry,
and work performed. Prior work (Hayward & Grady, 1986)
has developed four factors summarizing these characteris-
tics for 1960 detailed occupational codes--the codes used
in the NLS: substantive complexity, physical and environ-

mental demands, social skill requirements, and manipula-
tive skill requirements. The substantive complexity factor
corresponds closely to Spenner's definition of occupational
self-direction. Occupations ranking high on substantive
complexity involve working with data, require extensive
training, and are characterized by abstract, creative, and
nonrepetitive work. The other three factors reference differ-
ent types of job pressures. The manipulative skills factor
represents the extent to which work in an occupation in-
volves working with things and requires aptitudes such as
motor coordination, finger dexterity, and eye-hand-foot co-
ordination. The physical and environmental demands factor
taps strength requirements and usual physical activities
(e.g., stooping, kneeling, climbing) as well as the environ-
mental conditions surrounding the work activity (e.g., tem-
perature, presence of fumes, etc.). The social skills factor
references the extent to which work involves dealing with
people and whether or not it requires the physical capabili-
ties of talking, hearing, and seeing. How the DOT factors
differentiate the quality of work and the work environment
across major occupational groups is shown in Table 2,
which reports the mean values of the scales for 1-digit cen-
sus occupations.
The DOT information is assigned to NLS respondents
based on their 3-digit occupational code. As persons change
occupations over the observation period, new DOT infor-
mation is assigned to reflect the changes in the work en-
vironment. This results in a set of occupational histories
profiling mid and late career changes in the substantive
complexity of work, physical and environmental demands,
social skill requirements, and manipulative skill require-
ments. Because historical information is not available on
the changing nature of work within occupations, we assume
that an occupation's ranking relative to other occupations
on these dimensions does not vary significantly over the ob-
servation period.
Other time-varying measures of the structural imperatives
shown in Table 1 are taken directly from self reports. Mea-
sures of the extrinsic rewards and risks include the number
of prior unemployment spells and labor force exits observed
since baseline, compulsory retirement regulations, predicted
hourly earnings, and pension coverage. A measure of part-

time versus full-time employment (and unemployment) is
included to capture the marginality of older workers' work
attachment. Information is available to measure job tenure
indicating the level of employment stability. We measure po-
sition in the organizational structure using information on
the respondent's class of worker status. This allows us to dis-
criminate between employed persons in the private and gov-
ernment sectors from self-employed workers.
METHOD
Our prior discussion makes clear the importance of spec-
ifying a model that includes indicators of the structural im-
peratives experienced over the career. Career events also are
integral to understanding retirement by virtue of the fact
that events sometimes involve changes in the nature of
work or the interruption of the career through unemploy-
ment and labor force status changes. The model's basic
form is taken from the work of Mare (1990) and Moore and
Hayward (1990). This approach expands the traditional
static notion of occupation to encompass both longest and
latest occupation to distinguish the effects of the current
work environment from older workers' main occupational
work experience. The form of this model also is designed to
control for possible (negative and positive) retirement se-
lection effects. For example, as discussed previously, ef-
fects of the current occupation could potentially be at-
tributed both to the effects of exposure or to some type of
retirement-related selection into the occupation. After ear-
lier socioeconomic statuses are controlled, however, the net
effect of the current occupation is relatively purged from
selectivity effects (Mare, 1990, p. 366).
Here, the longest occupation is measured at baseline,
while the latest occupation is measured from 1966 until the
respondent left observation. Given the number of occupa-
tions individuals potentially hold over the career, our focus
on the longest and latest occupations is necessarily a sim-
plifying strategy. Attention to the longest occupation when
respondents were 45-59, however, has certain conceptual
merits because it taps the notion of the main career occupa-
tion prior to entry into the prime retirement ages.
Our basic analytic model takes the following elementary
form.
Z is a vector of occupational characteristics pertaining to
the person's longest occupation, including indicators of
substantive complexity, physical demands, and environ-
mental conditions. Wit) is a vector of time-dependent occu-
pational characteristics comparable to Z pertaining to the
latest occupation. U(t) is a vector of time-dependent career
event characteristics referencing mobility in and out of the
labor force, unemployment, and employer changes between
1966 and 1983. X(t) is a vector of time-dependent covari-
ates indexing traditional retirement determinants such as
health status and pension coverage. And Y(t) is a vector of
individual measures referencing sociodemographic and
background characteristics, some of which are time depen-
dent. The dependent variable in this model is the (log of
the) risk of a retirement or disability, where the risk refers
to the instantaneous probability of an event occurring at
time t.
The parameters, f$m
and (3n
, represent the main effects of
occupational incumbency over the mid and later portion of
the career on the (log of the) risk of retirement or disability.
If both estimates are statistically significant, support is indi-
cated for the idea that occupational positions in both mid
and late life pattern career endings, net of factors such as
unemployment, prior labor force mobility, and so on. Occu-
pational mobility or the change in occupational environ-
ments is captured through a set of interaction terms, (V The
vector of parameter estimates, po
, further identifies the ef-
fects of career mobility or discontinuity as reflected by un-
employment and movements in and out of the labor force.
Finally, based on the parameter estimates, pJq
, we assess
whether occupational effects change surrounding mobility
events. For example, we test explicitly whether the effect of
occupational environmental conditions changes after a per-
son has already experienced retirement and subsequently
reentered the labor force.
The analysis begins by estimating a reduced form model
including the explanatory variables indexing the characteris-
tics of the longest job and the sociodemographic and family
background characteristics. The reduced form model allows
us to assess the total effect of occupational incumbency in
the longest job (net of the sociodemographic factors). Then,
the vectors referencing current occupational conditions and
career mobility events are included in the model. Finally, the
full model introduces the traditional retirement determi-
nants, health status and pension coverage. Comparisons of
the full model with earlier models provide the means to as-
sess the indirect effects of career structure through the tradi-
tional retirement determinants.
A pseudo continuous-time hazard modeling approach is
used to estimate the models. Hierarchical model tests of al-
ternative baseline hazard functions indicate that a third
order, polynomial function provides the best fit for both the
retirement and disability events.
FINDINGS
To better understand how career structures influence
career endings, we begin by examining the frequency of oc-
CAREER TRAJECTORIES AND OLDER MEN'S RETIREMENT S97
cupational mobility at the end of the career. The row mobil-
ity counts shown in Table 3 are based on person-years of
exposure. The frequencies illustrate that both advancement
and attainment are common features of older men's careers.
On average, 42% of exposure in the late career is spent in
occupations other than the longest occupation (the sum of
the off-diagonal elements divided by total exposure). This
basic pattern holds regardless of whether mobility is con-
strained to only pre-retirement experiences (estimates not
shown) or whether the full span of late life activity is con-
sidered. Occupational mobility is not an infrequent occur-
rence for many older workers. Employment mobility is also
not an unusual occurrence. Prior to exiting the labor force,
approximately 38% of exposure is spent in a different firm
from that reported for the longest job (estimates not
shown). Employment mobility occurs both for those who
remain occupational stable as well as for those changing
occupations, although employer mobility is more strongly
associated with occupational changes (in both directions)
than occupational stability.
The highest rate of occupational retention is among pro-
fessionals (71%), reflecting both the attractiveness of work
and the fact that downward mobility is the only alternative.
The lowest rates of retention are found in the farm and non-
farm laborer occupations (43% and 46%, respectively).
Well over half of the exposure for workers in these occupa-
tions is spent elsewhere before the end of the career. It is
not surprising that most mobile workers do not move very
far, staying within the blue-collar/white-collar boundaries
--a finding similar to Blau and Duncan's (1967) research
on younger workers.
To assess whether occupational origins (i.e., the longest
occupation in 1966) are associated with the occupational
destinations of older workers, we calculated crude ratios of

the observed frequencies to expected ratios based on the
assumption of independence (e.g., Blau & Duncan, 1967).
The ratios are calculated using the information shown in
Table 3. For example, the ratio for retention in professional
occupations is calculated as: (cell frequency/row marginal
frequency)/(column marginal frequency/total frequency)
= (2,781/3,901)/(3,898/42,106) = 7.7. These calculations
were done both for the matrix shown in Table 3 and a pre-
retirement mobility matrix, and the pattern of results was
almost identical (results not shown although the estimates
are available on request). It is not surprising that occupa-
tional inheritance (i.e., the expected ratios in the diagonal of
the matrix exceeded 1.0) was greater than expected for all
of the occupational groups. However, despite the amount of
exposure in the off-diagonal cells, the effects of the longest
occupation on upward and downward mobility were not es-
pecially strong. A total of eight out of ninety off-diagonal
cells (four cells denoting upward mobility and four denot-
ing downward mobility) had a stronger than expected rela-
tionship. Thus, a substantial amount of mobility in the late
career does not appear to be patterned by the longest occu-
pation. Among white-collar workers, downward mobility
was exemplified by professionals moving into managerial
positions, and managers moving into sales occupations.
Men in sales occupations, however, also moved into man-
agerial positions at a relatively high rate. Among blue-collar
workers, upward mobility occurred by laborers moving into
operative and service occupations, and farm laborers mov-
ing into service positions. Farm laborers also moved into la-
borer occupations. Other cases of downward mobility were
farmers moving into farm laborer occupations and opera-
tives moving into laborer occupations.
The frequency of retirement and disability events also is
shown in the occupational cross-classification in Table 3.
One common pattern is that downward mobility is associ-
ated with higher rates of retirement (i.e., number of events
within a cell divided by the exposure within a cell). Less
clear is whether the converse also is true. Upward mobility
is not associated consistently with lower retirement rates. If
anything, upward mobility is associated with slightly higher
retirement rates. While one must be cautious about inferring
too much from these data, the patterns suggest that occupa-
tional mobility, whether upward or downward, increases re-
tirement rates. Occupational stability, except among farm
laborers, extends the overall length of work life.
Disability rates are highest for blue-collar workers com-
pared to white-collar workers. The highest disability rates
are for laborers followed by farm laborers and service
workers. The off-diagonal elements are difficult to evaluate
given the sparse data, but downward mobility seems to be
associated with a higher rate of disability. Examples in-
clude men exiting craft occupations for jobs as operatives
or laborers, and operatives moving to service positions.
The multivariate models provide the explicit tests of the
alternative hypotheses of career structure effects. We focus
first on the results showing how the structural imperatives,
occupational self-direction and job pressures, combine over
the career to affect exiting behavior. As shown in Table 4,
the results for the additive models indicate that these occu-
pational features influence both retirement and disability,
although different features come into play depending on the
career stage. As hypothesized, net of the longest occupa-
tion, the substantive complexity and physical demands of
the current occupation significantly influence the risk of re-
tirement (see Model 3). Men approaching retirement in jobs
allowing little autonomy, whose tasks are relatively boring
and mundane, and who work in physically demanding jobs
have elevated risks of retirement. These same features of
the longest job, however, have no independent effect. These
characteristics of the work environment thus come into play
directly only in jobs held proximate to the retirement event.
More surprising is the finding that persons whose longest
occupation involved significant personal communication
and dealing with people (e.g., teachers, postal clerks, insur-
ance agents, managers, and sales workers) showed lower
rates of retirement net of the characteristics of the current
occupation (see Models 1, 2, and 3). The specific mecha-
nism is ambiguous, although several post hoc explanations
are plausible. These types of occupations, for example, im-
pose few barriers for older workers and may imbue workers
with a general type of human capital providing a range of
opportunities in the late career. Alternatively, these types of
occupations may foster strong work-based social networks
or social capital which increase workers' long-term ties to
the workplace. Both arguments are consistent with the
crude estimates that can be gleaned from Table 3. There,
managerial occupations, which rank very high in social
skill requirements, have very low rates of retirement (crude
rate = .073 compared to the overall crude rate of .086). So,
top, do individuals who work in sales occupations continu-
ously in the late career (crude rate = .061).
Turning to how these structural imperatives affect dis-
ability, the results suggest generally that self-direction re-
duces the chances of a health-mandated exit. Model 1 im-
plies long-term effects; Model 2 implies more immediate
effects. And, when current health status is introduced in
Model 3, changes in the parameter estimate of substantive
complexity illustrate that low levels affect a health-man-
dated exit through health limitations developed on the job.
This finding reinforces a growing body of research linking
autonomy and creativity in the work environment to indi-
viduals' health and functioning (Moore & Hayward, 1990;
Johnson et al., 1989; Karasek, 1990; Karasek, Gardell, &
Lindell, 1987).
Model 1 also suggests that the physical and environmen-
tal demands in the longest occupation elevate the chances
of disability. Indeed, this is the job factor that most com-
monly comes to mind as a precursor of disability. However,
after characteristics of the current occupation and labor
force mobility are controlled, the physical and environmen-
tal demands of the longest job no longer have a significant
effect. The surprise here is the lack of a dominant effect--
either long-term or short-term--of physical and environ-
mental demands on disability.
Although disability is not sensitive to physical and envi-
ronmental demands, manipulative skill requirements in
both the longest and current jobs have substantial effects.
Manipulative skill requirements in the longest occupation
reduce the chances of disability (Models 1, 2, and 3), a re-
sult consistent with a practice or exercise effect where re-

CAREER TRAJECTORIES AND OLDER MEN'S RETIREMENT S101
quirements of manual dexterity and extensive eye-hand-
foot coordination reduce the chances of deteriorating
health. However, once manipulative skill requirements in
the longest job are controlled, these same requirements in
older workers' current occupation have the opposite effect.
They increase rather than decrease the risk of disability (see
Models 2 and 3), suggesting that extensive manipulative
skill requirements of jobs held late in the career have a
"wear and tear" effect on older workers. The results thus
suggest that both a practice effect and a "wear and tear" ef-
fect are operating to influence disability, but the effects
come into play depending on the stage of the career.
The results also demonstrate the importance of the struc-
tural imperatives, extrinsic rewards and risks and position
in the organizational structure, for retirement and disability.
Net of the measures of occupational self-direction and job
pressures, mandatory retirement regulations significantly
increase the chances of retirement. Pension coverage also
influences retirement as does current earnings. The earnings
effect is consistent with earnings' association with pension
benefit levels. Although these effects, in and of themselves,
are not novel, the presence of these effects in combination
with the effects of the other structural imperatives illus-
trates the variety of ways in which the work environment
affects retirement behavior.
A persistent feature of the longest occupation affecting
retirement is the class of worker. Self-employment substan-
tially lowers rates of retirement. This relationship is rela-
tively unaffected when the class of worker of the current
job is controlled. Moreover, there is no net effect of the
class of worker of the current job. This pattern suggests that
self-employment delays retirement not so much as a conse-
quence of individuals' adjustments of their labor supply in
accordance with their health (i.e., an effect that would be
embodied in the class of worker of the current job) but as a
consequence of lower lifetime pension wealth. Unlike
workers who make their careers in the private and govern-
ment sectors, self-employed workers bear the burden of
saving for retirement.
The relative lack of retirement options for self-employed
workers also is evident in their high rates of disability. In
Model 1, self-employment in the longest occupation has
long-term consequences for disability. However, when class
of worker in the current job is controlled, this aspect of the
longest occupation is no longer significant. Controlling for
self-employment in the longest occupation, persons who are
currently self-employed face elevated risks of disability
(Model 2). This is due largely to the higher prevalence of
poor health among these workers (Model 3), suggesting that
self-employment may be a work destination of "last resort"
for some workers. Self-employment, however, does not ap-
pear to "accommodate" the health problems of older workers.
Not shown in Table 4 are the results testing the two sets
of interactions contained in the analytic model. One set of
interactions allowed us to assess whether the effects of the
current occupation differed depending on whether workers
had ever exited the labor force (and reentered). We tested
for this effect and observed that none of the estimates were
statistically significant. The effects of the characteristics of
the current occupation, therefore, do not differ significantly
for persons with continuous work experience compared to
persons whose current occupation references a post-retire-
ment job. A second set of interactions was considered to
test for the effects of occupational mobility on retirement
and disability. In no instance were any of the interactions of
longest and current occupational characteristics statistically
significant, denoting that occupational mobility per se does
not influence retirement behavior.
Although occupational mobility per se affects neither re-
tirement nor disability, other forms of career mobility are
important explanatory factors. Most obvious are the effects
of unemployment over the career and changes in labor
force status. Mobile workers have the highest rates of re-
tirement. A history of unemployment places workers at
greater risk of retirement and the effect increases monotoni-
cally. As the number of unemployment episodes increases,
so too does the risk of retirement. A history of movement in
and out of the labor force also leaves an indelible mark.
Workers who have experienced a labor force exit have a
significantly higher chance of retirement relative to stable
workers (see Model 3). Employment mobility (i.e., in the
form of short job tenure) operates in the opposite manner
on retirement. Retirement is postponed for older workers
with short tenure. With the closure of retirement options
comes higher rates of disability. Short tenure delays retire-
ment primarily through inadequate pension coverage, while
it leads to disability through the onset of health problems
on the job.
CONCLUSIONS
Is the retirement process only a product of the immediate
circumstances prior to retirement, or is it embedded in the
broader context of the career? On balance, the results of
this study support the latter view. The longest occupation
held in the mid career combines with occupational roles
held in the last stages of the career to influence both retire-
ment and disability. As hypothesized, the specific structural
imperatives of occupations affecting retirement and disabil-
ity differ depending on the career stage. Net of the charac-
teristics of one's current position, self-employment and
greater social skill requirements of the longest occupation
lower the chances of retirement. The longest occupation's
manipulative skill requirements and substantive complexity
also influence the retirement process by reducing the
chances of disability. Net of the longest occupation, high
physical demands and low levels of substantive complexity
in late career occupations elevate retirement chances. So
too do mandatory retirement regulations and pension bene-
fits. And, a high level of manipulative skill requirements in-
creases the risk of disability. The combination of effects
demonstrates the importance of characterizing occupational
positions in multidimensional terms and taking into account
the temporal patterning of positions in order to sort out how
career structures influence the retirement process.
We hypothesized that occupational self-direction and job
pressures of jobs held late in the career would influence re-
tirement to a greater extent than these same features of mid
career occupations. This expectation holds for the most
part. We also suggested that if such factors have a long-
term effect that it would operate through the traditional de-
S102 HAYWARD ETAL
terminants of health status and pension characteristics. The
results are consistent with this perspective. The substantive
complexity of the longest occupation, for example, nega-
tively affects disability through the eventual development of
health problems on the job in occupations ranking low on
this scale. As noted above, this same feature in the late ca-
reer reduces the chances of retirement. In the first instance,
substantive complexity (or its absence) gives rise to health
problems that eventually mandate labor force withdrawal.
In the second instance, substantive complexity defines the
relative attractiveness of work and non-work alternatives
factoring into the retirement decision. This structural im-
perative thus combines over the career to influence both
voluntary and involuntary career endings.
The majority of the effects of the longest occupation op-
erate through the onset of health problems. We noted the
effects of physical demands and substantive complexity
above. Manipulative skill requirements in the longest job
have a protective effect, while these same requirements in
occupations held later in the career increase the risk of dis-
ability. The key exception to this pattern is the effect of self-
employment in the longest occupation. Its effect is consis-
tent with the argument that self-employed persons are
disadvantaged in terms of pension wealth, and hence access
to retirement, relative to persons working the private and
government sectors. At the risk of over interpreting the gen-
eral pattern of results, it appears that the long-term effects
of organizational position operate primarily through pen-
sion benefits, whereas the long-term effects of occupational
self-direction and job pressures are felt through the onset of
health problems.
The results provided no support for the idea that retire-
ment is hinged to occupational mobility. However, the
chances of retirement and disability are increased by unem-
ployment and labor force mobility. Retirement and disabil-
ity also are sensitive to employer shifts. Shifts delay the
onset of retirement while increasing the risk of disability.
Mobility between occupations, therefore, does not seem to
carry the same consequences as movements in and out of
work and between jobs. In part, this may reflect differences
in what these events mean in terms of fundamental changes
in the work role. Unemployment and labor force mobility,
for example, both represent major discontinuities in the ca-
reer and work role. Occupational mobility, at least as experi-
enced by this sample, does not signal a similar major change
in the work role. Some support for this idea is provided in
Table 3 where most moves are short distance moves.
At a general level, the results highlight the fact that retire-
ment and disability are not unique labor force behaviors
contingent only on one's circumstances in the late career.
Rather, these career endings are the outcomes of the trajec-
tories of occupational incumbency and labor force mobility.
Knowledge of both aspects of career structure is thus im-
portant for understanding the retirement process. The results
of this study also suggest that knowledge of career struc-
tures is integral to understanding the broader spectrum of
career achievement. Prior research has tended to focus only
on aspects of workers' current work environment for pro-
motion chances, occupational mobility, and wage changes.
Like retirement, however, these aspects of achievement may
be sensitive to the pathways by which workers arrive in
their current positions.
The broader substantive implication of these findings is
that future changes in the work-to-retirement transition will
be sensitive to those changes in career patterns now occur-
ring in American society. Increasingly, researchers and pol-
icy makers are documenting significant changes in career
patterns, especially the increase in employment uncertainty
and the decline in job tenure, brought about by industrial re-
structuring, shifts in consumer demand, and technological
change. These changes undoubtedly will have a ripple effect
on future shifts in retirement patterns. Although the exact
form of these changes is uncertain, the results shown here
indicate the likelihood of growing variability in the work-to-
retirement transition.
Many of the recently observed changes in career patterns,
especially those brought about through economic restructur-
ing, raise the specter of a withering away of traditional con-
tracts, both implied and explicit, linking workers and em-
ployers. How, or if, these contracts are being rewritten is not
yet clear. Simultaneously, the sanctity of Social Security
contract between workers and the state is in doubt. The age
eligibility criteria already have been changed for future co-
horts, and a significant number of younger Americans lack
confidence in the longer term viability of the Social Secu-
rity system.
It is tempting to surmise that retirement is becoming "de-
institutionalized." However, this may not be the case. As
yet, though the character of the traditional social contracts
may be changing, none of the key institutional actors ap-
pears to have abandoned retirement as a reward for a life-
time of work commitment or a means of social control. In-
stead, the diversity of the work-to-retirement transition may
represent a broadening of the institution of retirement. In-
creasingly, the institution is reflective of the assortment of
pathways forged and contested by the key institutional ac-
tors, the state, employers, and workers themselves.
