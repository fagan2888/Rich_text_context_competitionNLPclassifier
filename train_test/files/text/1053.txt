As the population lives longer, is it
living in more or less healthy states?
Manton and Gu (1) tackled this question
in a recent issue of PNAS. Understanding
whether the population is healthier or not
is vitally important to individuals and to
society as a whole. People value longevity
improvements more when the quality of
life of the additional years is high. Living
longer but with severe disability is no-
where near as enjoyable as living longer
with good health. The social consequences
of an aging population also depend on
average health. Disabled people use sig-
nificantly more medical resources than do
nondisabled people. If the elderly popu-
lation is increasingly healthy, the impact of
overall population aging on medical care
needs will be smaller than if the surviving
population is increasingly frail. Further,
policies to encourage additional work ef-
fort among the elderly will only be suc-
cessful if the elderly have the physical
capacity to perform the work. Reduced
disability will not solve the aging problem
for the public sector--medical spending is
increasing too rapidly for that--but it can
ameliorate the magnitude of the problem.
There has been a longstanding debate
concerning whether the elderly are more
or less healthy over time. Demographers
examining the issue in the 1970s con-
cluded that the elderly were increasingly
less healthy (2). The data used were not of
high quality, however, and they afforded
multiple interpretations (3). The National
Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS), first
conducted in 1982, was designed in part to
rectify this difficulty. The NLTCS asks
detailed questions about disability in a
consistent manner over time. It samples
from all of the elderly population, not just
community dwellers. And it now has
nearly 20 years of data from a consistent
questionnaire, asked in 1982, 1984, 1989,
1994, and 1999. In a recent issue of PNAS,
Manton and Gu (1) reported the findings
from the 1999 wave of the NLTCS.
Manton and Gu (1) present clear, over-
whelming evidence that the average
health of the elderly population is improv-
ing. Between 1982 and 1999, the share of
the elderly with severe disabilities, mea-
sured roughly as the ability to function
independently with ease, declined from
26.2% to 19.7%. The cumulative reduc-
tion in disability is 25%, or 1.7% per
year. The importance of this finding is
hard to overstate. The NLTCS data are
designed ideally to look at disability
changes, so these results have particular
credence. They are a major advance in
our knowledge.
Although initially greeted skeptically
(4), the NLTCS results are increasingly
being replicated in other studies, including
the National Health Interview Survey, the
Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey,
and the Survey of Income and Program
Participation (5). The one partial outlier is
the Supplement on
Aging to the Health In-
terview Survey, which
showed a constant dis-
ability rate by one mea-
sure over the 1984 to
1994 period and a de-
cline in disability by an-
other. Overall, the
weight of the evidence
suggests large disability
reductions, as shown in
the NLTCS. This is very welcome news.
Manton and Gu (1) have several other
important findings. First, they show that
the reduction in disability is occurring
increasingly more rapidly over time. Be-
tween 1982 and 1989, disability rates de-
clined by 1.0% per year. The rate of
decline increased to 1.7% per year be-
tween 1989 and 1994, and to 2.7% per year
between 1994 and 1999. Second, Manton
and Gu (1) show that disability is falling
for blacks as well as whites. Over the entire
1982 to 1999 time period, the annual
decline in disability for blacks roughly
equals that for whites, despite the fact that
black disability was increasing in the 1980s
and white disability was falling. Blacks
made up for the lost ground in the 1990s.
The important question raised by these
results is why disability is falling so rapidly.
Manton and Gu (1) provide tantalizing ev-
idence on this question, but do not tackle it
head on. Understanding the cause of re-
duced disability is vital, because it indicates
whether the decline in disability can be
expected to continue into the future or not.
Disability reductions resulting from im-
proved public health measures at the turn of
the 20th century, for example, will not be as
important over the next few decades, when
the elderly population will have been born
substantially after those improvements,
whereas disability reductions resulting from
shifts away from manual labor would be
expected to continue.
The cause of disability decline is multi-
factorial. One clear contributing factor is
improved medical treatments. Many
elderly are disabled by arthritis, which can
be treated with pharmaceuticals (NSAIDs
and, increasingly, COX-2 inhibitors) or, in
the extreme, joint replacement surgery.
Use of these technologies has expanded
over time. Cataract surgery is also increas-
ingly common and
reduces disability as-
sociated with visual
impairment. Manton
and Gu (1) provide
indirect evidence for
the importance of
technological im-
provements for dis-
ability reduction.
They note the coin-
cidence between re-
duced cardiovascular disease mortality
and the implementation of Medicare.
Heart disease is a leading cause of chronic
disability, so this is an important link.
More direct evidence comes from studies
showing the role of specific medications in
reduced hypertension (6), a leading risk
factor for strokes, and from studies show-
ing the spread of cataract surgery to peo-
ple with increasingly less severe visual
impairment (7). Because the NLTCS has
data on Medicare records that are linked
to the survey participants, estimates of the
role of medical technology in improved
health can be conducted.
Behavioral changes are also important
in reduced disability. The one-third de-
cline in cigarettes smoked between 1960
and the late 1990s reduces chronic respi-
ratory damage, heart disease, and strokes.
Reduced fat intake over the same time
period (8) has had similar effects. The
impact of improved diets and reduced
smoking for emphysema, heart disease,
and stroke are likely key contributors in
reduced disability in the past two decades.

Manton and Gu present
clear, overwhelming
evidence that the average
health of the elderly
population is improving.

A third explanation is the spread of
assistive devices for people with health
troubles. Canes and walkers help infirm
elderly stay out of nursing homes; walk-in
showers and grab bars prevent hip frac-
tures and allow those who have had a
fracture to live independently; microwave
ovens make it easier for the frail elderly to
cook; and telephones with larger keypads
enable the visually impaired to communi-
cate. Manton and colleagues (9), in earlier
work with the NLTCS, documented a
large change in use of assistive devices
over time. Increased use of assistive de-
vices has been found in other surveys as
well (10).
Such assistive devices may be particularly
important in reduced nursing home utiliza-
tion. Manton and Gu (1) document the
enormous decline in nursing home resi-
dence between 1982 and 1999, particularly
in the last few years. Although some of this
decline reflects reduced disability overall,
another part reflects the growth of assisted
living facilities that provide many of these
assistive technologies in a more pleasant
environment than a nursing home.
The impact of assistive devices on dis-
ability in the community is more difficult
to ascertain. In the NLTCS, as in other
surveys of disability, people using assistive
devices specifically designed to provide
help with daily functions are counted as
disabled. Thus, providing canes to people
with arthritis would increase disability,
even if walking longer distances had be-
come easier. As a result, the true decline
in disability may be even greater than
Manton and Gu (1) report. The net impact
of assistive device use on disability has yet
to be sorted out.
An additional factor in reduced disability
is improved socioeconomic status. Manton
and Gu (1) highlight a key aspect of this, the
increasing education of the elderly. Manton
and Gu (1) show that more educated indi-
viduals have a disability rate of only about
half as much as less edu-
cated people. Coupled
with the large increase in
the share of elderly with
high school and college
degrees, this finding
helps to explain the de-
cline in disability in re-
cent decades. Indeed,
this trend will continue
for many decades into
the future as education among the elderly
continues to increase.
The important question is why educa-
tion is related to disability. Education can
influence disability in many ways: by al-
lowing greater access to medical care re-
sources, by increasing knowledge about
appropriate health behaviors, and by the
direct impact of mental stimulation on
cognitive functioning. For example, Stern
et al. (11) speculate that educational at-
tainment imparts a reserve that delays the
onset of Alzheimer's disease.
Occupation is closely related to educa-
tion and is a further dimension of socio-
economic status. The current elderly who
worked in blue-collar jobs over their life-
time were exposed to substantially more
dust and fumes than were the elderly who
worked in white-collar jobs. The same is
true for elderly who lived on farms, which
was much more common decades ago than
it is today. Costa (12) shows that the
change in occupational composition ex-
plains a significant part of the long-term
decline in disability in the United States.
Estimates of the impact of occupation
change in recent decades are lacking.
Finally, disability reduction may reflect
a change in the disease environment over
time. Increasing evidence documents that
infectious diseases
encountered early in
life influence health
later in life. The link
between rheumatic
fever and rheumatic
heart disease is par-
ticularly clear (13).
Associations also
have been shown be-
tween heart disease
and typhoid (14), measles (15), and ma-
laria (16). Even prenatal factors such as
maternal malnutrition and lack of ade-
quate weight gain may influence late life
disease (17). Older generations of elderly
were more exposed to these diseases and
conditions as children than were younger
generations, which may partly explain the
change in disability over time.
Little research has tested and compared
these different theories. With the report
on disability decline in the Manton and Gu
(1) paper, the basic facts about disability
change are now complete. The next few
years should turn to research considering
why disability has changed, testing these
and other explanations. Our knowledge of
chronic disability, advanced so clearly by
Manton and Gu (1), should grow even
more rapidly in the years ahead.
