A Note on Drawing
Conclusions in the Study of
Visual Search and the Use
of Slopes in Particular

Abstract
The slope of the set size function as a critical statistic first gained favor in the 1960s due in large
part to the seminal papers on short-term memory search by Saul Sternberg and soon, many
others. In the 1980s, the slope statistic reemerged in much the same role in visual search as
Anne Treisman and again, soon many others brought that research topic into great prominence.
This note offers the historical and current perspective of the present author, who has devoted a
significant portion of his theoretical efforts to this and related topics over the past 50 years.

current perspective, historical perspective, slope of set size, visual search
Within the now established and rather enormous field of visual search, Kristjansson (2015)
argued forcefully in his original i-Perception article against the employment of slopes of set
size functions. Wolfe (2016) responds that he agrees with many of the former author's points
but cautions against ``throwing out the baby with the bath water,'' due to this statistic's
overall utility. Kristjansson replies (this issue) that applying the Townsend and Ashby (1978)
Inverse Efficiency Score to neutralize SAT effects, slope differences remain in his original
experiment. This brief article is in response to the editor's kind invitation to expand and
reinterpret my original review in the form of a theoretical or philosophical or methodological
note. Thus, the present note offers my perspective on these matters.
Although specific questions within this and similar issues can often be answered definitively
by experimental facts, mathematics, or logic, many other questions lie on a continuum
between ``fact'' and what must be judged as personal and debatable philosophy of science.
I believe the following claims partake of some degree at several levels of debate.
(I) Slopes from the Standpoint of the Architecture of Search (usually restricted to parallel
and serial architectures, with the understanding that our use of ``architecture'' does not

necessarily imply immutability): I have maintained for almost 50 years that slopes, or
more generally, increases in response times (RTs) as a function of set size, n, are
primarily an indicant of work load capacity, not architecture. Thus, slopes generally
serve as an ineffectual statistic to test architectures against one another. However, there
is (and always has been) an asymmetry of logic here: Non-zero slopes are readily, and
intuitively, produced by serial as well as limited capacity parallel models, but zero
slopes or slopes associated with unlimited (or super!) capacity parallel models, are
biologically and psychologically incompatible with serial processing.
(II) Doctrines Concerning Slopes: There are several assumptions associated with tying in the
slope statistic with theories of search, as opposed to the slope performing simply as a
descriptive statistic:
(1) Among these, perhaps most relevant to the current discussion and one emphasized
by Kristjansson, is the principle that the slope should be an invariant across certain
experimental manipulations such as response type. Such restriction is a valuable tool
of theory construction--for instance, invariance is one of the most central concepts
at all levels of modern physics. However, the scientist should always be aware of the
extra theoretical baggage attending such an assumption. In the present milieu, this
principle seems most compatible with a highly constricted version of serial
processing. For instance, consider an experiment using Response Type A and
suppose the data are well predicted by a standard serial model (i.e., the processing
times are the same random variable for all items, are stochastically independent and
additive). Now contemplate the parallel class of models that perfectly mimic this
serial model. The invariant search axiom seems quite natural for the standard serial
model when we move to experiments with Response Type B. It may seem far less
cogent that parallel rates are such as to predict that invariance.
(2) With further regard to the theme just above, the conclusion that attentive visual search
is serial has always been unwarranted or at least on shaky ground. The field of short-
term memory search formerly made the same mistake of inferring that approximately
straight line (and non-zero sloped) mean response time set size functions alone imply
seriality (although it is important to mention that, unlike most others, the progenitor,
Saul Sternberg (e.g., 1966), employed additional evidence such as addition of cumulant
statistics, to back up his claims). Again stressing the asymmetric nature of inference
here, flat mean RT set size pop out effects do falsify reasonable serial models.
Additionally, it is not even clear that the huge corpus of memory set size curves in
the literature are always straight lines, but rather better fit as log functions, as was
emphatically demonstrated early on by Swanson & Briggs (1969). Recent evidence
strongly points to early visual processing being unlimited capacity parallel with an
exhaustive processing stopping rule which predicts a curve well approximated as a
logarithmic function (Buetti, Cronin, Madison, Wang, & Lleras, 2016). If set size
curves are not even straight lines, then much of the present-day inference-drawing
based on slopes, seems ill advised. Finally, note that considerably more power in
inference is bestowed when the scientist includes several stopping rules in the same
study (e.g., see Townsend & Ashby, 1983, Chapter 4, Section: The Capacity Issue).
(III) Nulling Out Speed Accuracy Tradeoffs: Processing capacity has always been one of my
major concerns from the very first papers on psychological processing systems (e.g., see
Townsend, 1972, 1974). Of course, when accuracy varies, ever since the seminal works
of psychologists like Wayne Wickelgren and Robert Pachella, we have realized that we
must take into account both errors and speed when assessing capacity. Townsend and
Ashby (1978) deliberate on many aspects of psychological processing systems relating
2 i-Perception 0(0)
to capacity, among them speed accuracy tradeoffs. They propose as a rough and
approximate method of cancelling out speed accuracy tradeoffs, the statistic
(employing Kristjansson's terminology) inverse efficiencies (IES) ¼ Mean RT/
(1ÀMean Error Rate). If the scientist knows the true model (impossible to be sure,
and please observe the inescapable model dependency in this context), then the best way
to null out speed accuracy tradeoffs is to estimate the parameter(s) associated with
efficiency such as the serial or parallel rates of processing of, say, correct and
incorrect information. IES will likely inevitably be a very coarse approximation to
such a statistic. Although I (and I imagine Ashby) very much appreciate application
of IES, more information would be helpful in proving that its use here justifies the
inference concerning slope changes. For instance, if one can show (and this is
potentially achievable) that IES is at least as conservative as, for instance, measuring
the rates of processing in Poisson versions of serial or parallel models (see, e.g.,
Townsend & Ashby, 1983, Chapter 9), then the inference drawn by Kristjansson
gains in credibility. Showing that a particular model provides excellent predictions
and fits and then using the appropriate parameters to cancel out decisional effects
would be even more impressive.
In conclusion, in my opinion, the science of visual search would profit by utilizing the now
substantial battery of experimental procedures that provide quite precise and sturdy
assessment of critical aspects of processing such as architecture, workload capacity,
stopping rule, and independence. Many of these are distribution and parameter free. Then,
such statistics such as slope and more generally the curvature of the mean RT set size
function for various stopping rules can be engaged as dependent variables to study how
various conditions, individual differences (including various pathologies), and experimental
demands affect the underlying processing structure and mechanisms. In addition to a number
of earlier treatments and surveys (available at http://www.indiana.edu/$psymodel/), very up
