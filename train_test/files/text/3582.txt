Sharing Food and Breaking
Boundaries: Reading of Acts
10­11: 18 as a key to Luke's
Ecumenical Agenda in Acts

Abstract
In Acts 10­11: 18, Luke use a set of connected stories about Peter, shared eating, and food to explore issues
of Christian boundaries and the boundaries between Christians. Luke's presentation of the apostolic history
argues for a genuine ecumenism between Jewish and Gentile Christians characterized and enacted through
commensality. Moreover, when this commensality within the Eucharistic pattern of all early Christian
community meals, we see that it has a bearing on how Luke viewed the Christian symposium; while it has
definite implications for Christian Eucharistic sharing/ecumenism today.

In Acts 10­11:18 Luke presents us with a series of meals whose memory he considers of impor-
tance in his vision of a world church:1 one that reaches from Jerusalem out to the ends of the earth.2
Moreover, these meals were recalled by him in such a manner that they were intended to challenge
the already received wisdom of the churches in which his stories were being heard.3 Recalling the
structure and salient points of Luke's narrative allows us to speculate on some of the tensions pre-
sent in early communities, while offering us material for reflection on our own practice which may
have a bearing on certain issues in both missiology and ecumenism.
Peter's meals
The section of Acts with which I am concerned ­ 10: 1­11: 18 ­ is conventionally seen as forming
a unit within a larger set of stories about Peter as a missionary (9: 31­11: 18),4 and this particular
section is usually characterized not in terms of meals but in terms of its final outcome: the
conversion of Cornelius and his household.5 However, instead of reading the story as one about
conversion, or indeed its immediate Sitz im Leben in the churches where Luke was being read,

where it was probably related to the disputes between Jewish-Christians and Gentile-Christians
about keeping the purity laws, one can read it as a story about how food was used in the churches.
The basis for this shift in emphasis is provided in the text itself when at 10: 28, Peter is presented
as declaring that no person is `common' (koinos in the sense of `profane') or unclean on the basis
of his previous vision that no food is common or unclean (10: 14). Luke is, therefore, thinking
simultaneously about food and people. So, reversing the interpretation of the images, we can read
the whole story in terms of food, its consumption, and how the table manners of those who follow
Jesus can be, in this story, a guide to Christian action.
The scene is set in 10: 1­9 when a Roman soldier ­ who is neither a Jew nor a gentile follower
of Jesus ­ is praying at the ninth hour and is told by an angel that because of his righteous human
behaviour (10: 4) his path and that of Simon Peter would encounter one another. This means that
he will be brought within the new covenant community (Lk 22: 20) through an apostle: Peter (Acts
1: 2). The `back-story' complete, Luke now tells the main story beginning with a hungry Peter.
Peter is at the sixth hour praying, and becomes hungry and so wants something cooked for
him and for this he has to wait. Luke just takes it for granted that we understand that when an
apostle wants food there is some sort of provisioning service available to him ­ and we must
recall that Peter is not in his own home but a guest lodging with Simon the tanner in Joppa (Acts
10: 6). However, the guidance offered on how followers of The Way are to receive visiting `apos-
tles and prophets' in the Didache illumines the situation. Normally, the guests are not to stay
more than one or two days (Acts 9: 43 tells us Peter had stayed there some time ­ no doubt due
to his special position as a leader among the apostles), but any apostle or prophet is to be wel-
comed `as if they were the Lord'. Clearly, these guests often asked their hosts to provide them
with food, because the Didache reminds communities that they are to be given just enough food
when they leave to sustain them until their next lodging, and communities are to be suspicious
of those who order a banquet for themselves `in the spirit'.6 It was, therefore, taken for granted
that Peter, an apostle, would be provided with the food he needed while a guest, and indeed that
he had simply to ask for it from their hospitality! It is also clear that other apostles ­ a much
larger group than `the twelve'7 ­ were abusing the customs that we see taken for granted here in
Acts ­ and hence the Didache has to offer warning advice to communities.8 One other point
needs to be noted: this household in which Peter is lodging is a Jewish household (as we should
expect given that this tanner is named `Simon'), and the food that would be provided would be
lawful in accordance with purity and food customs that claimed their basic authority from Lev
11: 2­23 and Deut 14: 3­20. Everything is, in other words, proceeding according to the Torah
and the expected customs: `situation normal'.
While Peter awaits his hosts' provision of food, something happens. Luke wants us to imagine
this as explicitly out of the ordinary for he tells us that Peter fell into an ecstasy (ekstasis) and so
this does not belong to the world of rational discourse or the cultural world of Joppa. A great square
sheet full of impure animals is lowered down before him; and all these animals are offered to Peter
as a divine gift of food. The four-cornered sheet is meant to bring to our minds a table cloth and all
that is akin to a banquet of many meats suitable for a feast,9 and it can be taken as implying the
whole living world as created.10 Peter is to kill and eat, but refuses for he rejects ­ and always has
until this moment in his life ­ that which is common (koinos) and unclean. Now the voice tells him
that God makes all clean, so to call any food `common' is to be untrue to reality ­ even if (we are
to infer) such a statement would be true to the law. Just so that we know this is a serious message
we are then told it happened three times ­ in the narrative world of the early Christians important
moments need to be produced in triplicate.11 But despite the repetition, the significance of the
vision of all this food offered from heaven for his hunger was not immediately apparent to Peter
for, fully awake and back in the world of Joppa, he was `greatly perplexed' (10: 17).
O'Loughlin 29
At this point the three people sent by Cornelius appear outside and Peter is told by the Spirit that
he is to go with them without hesitation ­ but before they went anywhere, Peter (a lodger himself
in Simon's house) `invited them in12 and he received them as guests (exenisen)' (10: 23).13 Peter
the guest has now turned into the host, and is extending a welcome to others. This shift in status to
make Peter the primary agent of what is happening is demanded by the nature of Luke's message:
Peter is taking a decisive step and he is fully responsible for it. But what is this step ­ surely `giving
them lodging' (a common translation) is no more than practical hospitality ­ in our parlance `put-
ting them up for the night' ­ in view of the fact that they have a long journey to Caesarea to make
the next day. It would be quite unreasonable to imagine that a journey of approximately 30 miles
could be embarked on immediately by those who had just come from there.14 But this is far more
than just `finding them a bed'. What is implicit in welcoming them as guests ­ sharing not only the
house space but the table in the house ­ is spelled out a little later: Peter will be criticized for having
dealings with the uncircumcised and for eating with them (11: 3) and will say that at the very
moment he met these messengers that `the Spirit told [him] to go with them and not to make a
distinction between them and us'(11: 12). In effect, in welcoming these messengers as guests Peter
has recognized that one can eat ­ precisely because the Spirit has revealed it ­ with any of God's
creatures because this too has been revealed: no one is common or unclean (10: 28). It is with these
three anonymous messengers ­ two slaves and a pious soldier ­ that Luke imagines The Way mov-
ing beyond the confines of the People of Israel and the boundaries of the Torah. And that boundary
is transgressed in an act of welcoming and table sharing. Thus Peter ­ and so all apostles ­ are
expected to continue the boundary breaking commensality that was an important theme in Luke's
portrayal of Jesus: `This fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them' (Lk 15: 2).15
Two days later, Peter and Cornelius meet in Caesarea, and began to talk. Lest the significance
of what had already happened in Joppa (when Peter entertained the Gentile messengers) and of
what was now happening in Caesarea be lost on his audience, Luke spells out the settled position
of the Jerusalem church explicitly. Peter speaks to the assembled Gentile household ­ a group that
already looks like `a church'16 because they are said to be `in the presence of God' (10: 33) ­ thus:
`You yourselves know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or to visit a Gentile; but God
has shown me that I should not call any common or unclean' (10: 28). Peter is now formally
acknowledging what those who were attentive in the audience have already realized: since he wel-
comed those messengers as guests, Peter has been living in a new cosmos where nothing can be
called common because all is made good by God.
Cornelius then tells his part of the story (10: 30­33) and Peter replies with a `history of salva-
tion'sermon (10: 34­43) such as Luke places in his mouth on several occasions in Acts.17 But there
are two variants. First, previous speeches have been addressed to people of Israel, this is addressed
to the righteous in every nation ­ because he now recognizes that God does not have favourites (10:
35). Second, for the first time the appearance of the risen Jesus contains a reference to the theme of
the post-resurrection meals:18 the witnesses to the resurrection are those who ate and drank with
Jesus then (10: 41). Encountering the risen Lord is a meal-sharing experience ­ which would have
been heard by Luke's audience in terms of their own Eucharistic meal-sharing.19 Moreover, eating
is not simply a matter of nourishment or a matter of law keeping: eating and drinking together
identify people (in this case as specially chosen witnesses; 10: 41), and is a means of establishing
the eschatological community. Sharing food and drink is a serious religious engagement: it can join
Jew with Jew, Jew with Gentile, and the disciple with the Lord.
When Peter had finished his speech, the Holy Spirit fell on the group ­ much to the surprise of
the six Jewish-Christians (11: 12) that had travelled with Peter ­ and so it was evident that `the
Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles' (10: 44­45). Then the household was bap-
tized, and Peter and the other Jewish Christians live as guests in that Gentile household (10: 48).
30 Transformation 32(1)
But such radical action demands a reckoning and so the story now moved back to Jerusalem
(11: 1) where Peter gives an account of what has happened by retelling the vision of the sheet full
of animals offered him as food (11: 5­10). This retelling repeats the message that all is created
clean and so should not be called common (11: 9) and so there is no basis for the objection made
against him that he should not have eaten with the uncircumcised (11: 3). Eating together is seen
as responding to the divine initiative and to establish a bond that is more profound than circumci-
sion: indeed, eating ordinary food ­ for no food is common or unclean ­ together forms the actual
bond of the ecumenical community of the risen Christ.
Trances, Voices, and Angels
One of the most significant features of the whole story is the density of divine interventions ­ in
one form or another ­ that characterize the story. It might be objected that such miraculous ele-
ments are found throughout Acts ­ the ascension of Jesus into the clouds (1: 9), the destruction of
Ananias and Sapphira (5: 6 and 5: 11), the vision of Stephen (7: 55), or Paul's handkerchiefs (19:
12) ­ but not with such connected frequency. Indeed, the web of references to `other worldly', and
the repetition of these references, suggest that Luke wants us to be more aware here than elsewhere
of the `other worldly' nature of the task of the apostles and the churches.
The first `event' is the vision of `an angel of God' ­ as `a man in dazzling clothes' standing
`before him' `in his house' given to the Gentile, Cornelius. This `holy angel' (10: 22) then
speaks to him with his message that God has seen his righteousness. We are told this in Luke's
voice from his perfect knowledge as the all-seeing narrator (10: 3­7); then it is repeated by the
messengers, as a report of an event, for Peter's benefit by the messengers (10: 22); then it is
repeated by Cornelius himself in oratio recta which re-affirms it and shows that he has under-
stood its full import (10: 30­32); and then we hear it a fourth time: when Peter in his own voice
repeats Cornelius's account (11: 13­14), and thus affirms to `his' narrative audience that this
vision has divine credentials. This angelic visitation is thus one of the most attested events in
the whole story of Acts.
The second `event' is the trance and vision of Peter where he hears a voice that comes from
heaven (10: 10­6).20 Having been given the story in Luke's voice as narrator, it is repeated for us,
almost verbatim, as Peter's own experiences (11: 5­10). From the audience's perspective this not
only allows Luke to repeat the key message, but within the logic of the narrative allows him to
present Peter `owning this vision' and so all that is implied in it and all that Peter will infer from it.
Moreover, we the audience have already been given an advantage in understanding in comparison
with the disciples in Jerusalem in that Peter has already narrated this as an action of God in his
speech to Cornelius's household when he said that `but God has shown me that I should not call
anyone common or unclean' (10: 28).
The third `event' is when the Spirit speaks to Peter about the messengers and how he is to react
to them. This is told to us, first, in Luke's voice (10: 19) and then we hear Peter's recollection of
this (11: 12) which makes explicit what is implied in the Spirit's message when it is told to us by
Luke. Through this rhetorical device we do not merely have to take the divine decision on Luke's
authority, but we have Peter openly declaring that the Spirit told him that he was not to make a
distinction between Jew and Gentile. And practically, this meant that he was not to make such a
distinction at table ­ which is the very action that has prompted an accusation against him (11: 3)
and this defence.
The fourth `event' is that `the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard the word' (10: 44). This is
then acknowledged ­ and so repeated ­ as a fact by Peter (10: 47), then recalled in Jerusalem (11:
15); and repeated yet again as part of the overall conclusion of the story (11:17-8). We, the
O'Loughlin 31
audience, can be under no doubt that this whole sequence of events begins with God, and not
with a human situation (contrast Mark 7: 24­30), is made explicit in its significance by prophetic
means, and that it is to be considered significant in memory through its multiple iterations in the
narrative.
So why has Luke used so much repetition? This pattern of repetition allows his audience to hear
the story at three levels. Most simply we have the account of the narrator, Luke, coming directly to
us as a series of connected details set in a temporal sequence over a matter of days that we are
simply expected to appreciate as historical facts. Within this narrator's level, the repetitions are set
merely as recollections, at specific points, of earlier events in the sequence. Then, secondly, we
have the direct testimony of the characters in their own voices as they declare the `other worldly'
acts of which they are witnesses. This is their declaration of the works of God, and on the basis of
their witness we, the audience, are expected to affirm the veracity of the details of the story. The
third level is the act of repetition itself, which takes historical form in the recollection by Peter
when he has returned to Jerusalem, and this is presented as being `read into the record'of the whole
church. Thus the repetition, most significantly in Peter's `orderly [kathexés] account' (11: 4) as we
find it in 11: 5­17, is the formal ecclesial memory of an event of revelation. Once this `orderly
account' is received, it is accepted by the church as the will of God made manifest (11: 18).
Meanwhile, the audience hearing this are expected to realize that they too must acknowledge the
story and hold it as part of their own memory as disciples.
Customary Background
Luke's story presupposes that the issue of how disciples eat with one another is one that he
considers of importance. Apart from what he tells us in the story about hesitations among
Jewish followers of The Way about eating with Gentiles, we have some other hints that throw
light on the story.21 The Didache assumes that Gentiles can become part of The Way of Life,
and also that with regard to food regulations people should do what they are able to do (6: 3),
and so, by implication, everything less than the Torah is to be seen as a concession. As such, it
can be seen as an expression of Jewish Christianity,22 such as we see in Peter at the time he went
into the ecstasy (Acts 10: 14), his somewhat startled companions (10: 45), and, more explicitly,
his Jerusalem accusers (11: 3). That such a customary background as we find in the Didache is
the setting for Luke's story is made more plausible, not only because of the way Peter behaves
in Simon the Tanner's house, as noted above, but also in the fact that Peter is praying at the
sixth hour, while Cornelius is praying at the ninth hour ­ such a pattern is consistent with that
prescribed in Didache 8: 3.23 However, there is a hesitation in the Didache in that it assumes
that only those who are already baptised can join in the meals of the community (9: 5), and it
would be anachronistic to think of these meals as distinct `eucharistic meals' separate from
other community meals.24 Moreover, the boundary between those with whom one could and
could not eat are well patrolled in that the next comment in the Didache is: `Remember what
the Lord has said about this: "do not give to the dogs what is holy"' (9:5).25 This implies a world
of holy and common, clean and unclean, insiders and outsiders.26 This is the precise set of
assumptions among disciples of Jesus such as Peter and his Jerusalem accusers which the story
in Acts 10­11 is meant to undermine as baseless. To many early communities ­ such as those
represented by the Didache ­ eating with outsiders was still problematic, and something that
could only take place after their repentance and baptism. Within the Lukan story we have the
possibility that righteousness and the Spirit are there already, that God shows not partiality, and
that no one is to be called unclean ­ and so, presumably not referred to as a `dog' ­ and so the
final community is established in the act of communal eating.
32 Transformation 32(1)
Contemporary Implications?
One of the most bitter27 divisions in Christianity today also concerns with whom one can eat one
meal in particular: that of the Eucharist. This prohibition on shared eating and drinking does not ­
and this would shock both the formulators of the Didache and Luke ­ concern non-Christians but
those who are Christians (their baptism is not in doubt) but not `with us' in some shape or other.
The usual justification for this refusal to make `others' welcome at `our' table (recall Acts 10: 23)
is that one cannot eat together at the Eucharist as part of a process toward unity, but only after some
juridically-perfect unity has been achieved. This position ­ which de facto then perpetuates senses
of exclusion, reinforces division, and sets a premium on discovering further elements of disagree-
ment ­ is seen as based in the divine nature of the commensality involved, and the detailed ration-
ale to support it varies little whether it emerges from Roman Catholic28 or Orthodox sources.29 But
before proceeding further along this line of thought, there are two preliminary questions needing
attention. First, to what extent can we see a real connection between the meals being mentioned in
Acts and Eucharistic eating (then or now)? If it is the case that the meals inActs a simple an expres-
sion of general hospitality ­ and for all concerned the Eucharist was something distinct ­ then
seeking to any implication from Acts for Eucharistic practice would be little more than drawing a
pious moral, however apposite, rather than arguing a case from relevant precedents. The second
issue is that of the significance of any one historical situation to inform us in another, contemporary
situation. For many, this second issue hardly arises: if the first issue can be answered satisfactorily,
then Scripture qua Scripture can be seen as normative practice; but such an appeal, if made, still
leaves many questions unanswered and so an attempt to sketch another hermeneutic is in order.
So, addressing the first issue, what possible connection has the shared meals described in Acts
with the ritual event in contemporary Christianity variously labelled `the Eucharist', `the Lord's
Supper', `Mass', `Holy Communion', or whatever? Until quite recently ­ the late 1970s ­ such a
question would have had a definite answer: ordinary eating, even though it might be an expression
of fellowship and have a `blessing' at its start, was one thing; the `Lord's Supper' as a deliberate
fulfilment of a dominical command30 was quite another. Ordinary meals were meals, whereas the
Lord's Supper was a theological event utilizing the form of a meal. This interpretation was, in
effect, little more than the retrojection of much later church practice into the earliest period: just as
their meals and a church-based ritual were quite distinct so too was the practice of the earliest
Christians, and evidence that seemed to challenge that neat distinction between community meals
and celebration of the Eucharist such as references to `the Agape' in Jude 12 or the fact that the
blessings over loaf and cup in the Didache were clearly for use at a real meal were either sidelined
as irrelevant31 or deviant.32 However, one of the most radical developments in the study of early
Christian practice in the last few decades has been with regard to their meal practice and its central-
ity in their community life.33 The result of this scholarship ­ and it forms the paradigm within
which this article is written ­ is that we cannot imagine `meals' and `Eucharists' and then think of
them being somehow `combined' or `blended' in early practice,34 but rather must look on such
distinctions as later historical developments. Thus the task is to appreciate the meal practices (in all
their diversity) of the Jesus movement, knowing that this was a significant part of their discipleship
(as witness for example in the number of meal stories about Jesus that they recalled) and something
they held to be distinctive about them as a community (as witness Paul's concerns about the meal
practices in Corinth).35 In these meals the celebrated who they were, they recalled their memo-
ries,36, the heard the kerugma,37 and offered Jesus'blessing of the Father over a loaf of bread which
was broken and shared and over cup of some liquid ­ we have evidence for the use of water as well
as of wine38 ­ which was then shared. It is against such a view that we have to read all the refer-
ences to meals from early Christianity and so the radical distinction between `the Last Supper'
O'Loughlin 33
(itself a later construct which was read in particular accounts) and the other meals of Jesus, the
miraculous feedings, and references to food as in the Bread of Life material in John's gospel ­
about which there was endless debate in other exegesis as to whether it was relevant to the Eucharist
or not ­ disappears. All these memories have to be read in the context of the meal experience of
those who recalled, valued, and transmitted those stories.39 From this perspective, the meals being
discussed ­ and the boundaries they imply ­ in Acts 10 have to be seen as part of his contemporar-
ies' concern with meal-sharing as part of their discipleship. Since it is a legacy of that concern that
produced the specifically ritual meals, with their token sharing of food, that is called the Eucharist,
if early practice has any relevance to the practice of modern Christians, then those meals are
Eucharistically relevant. So now we must turn to the second hermeneutical questions.
To suggest that practices of the early churches are a norma normans for all subsequent Christian
practice ­ despite the fact that this is a claim that most churches have frequently invoked in the past
­ is neither practical (for we cannot recreate the social world of the first centuries) nor theologi-
cally justified (for it would be tantamount to a biblical fundamentalism with all its problems and
faults). On the other hand, given that Christians today continue to read texts such as Acts and to
value them as their precious common memories means that we do not simply consign them to the
past as prologue. In this case I would propose a rather simple hermeneutic: given that we make
sense of our present in retrospection and recollection, we look to the past as a kind of wondrous
`mirror' ­ one where we sometimes find a reflection in concerns and patterns of behaviour and
sometimes we find a distinct lack of reflection. In each case, the action of approaching the mirror
is important in that it allows us to evaluate our own discipleship within our own situation. It could
be that we are acting in virtually the same way as those we read about in the past; and this very lack
of difference is the problem because the external situation has changed; or it could be that we are
struck by the differences and these call us to question again our own assumptions even when we
have set great value on them.40 It is in this latter manner that I suggest that contemporary concerns
about sharing the Eucharistic meal, and the boundaries that are so often applied to its sharing, may
gain insight from looking at an earlier set of concerns about meal sharing (and as we have seen, this
involved what we would call Eucharistic meal-sharing) and boundaries. The earlier practice is not
being presented as `this is what is should be' but rather as posing a set of important questions for
today which have a right to be considered in both theology and practice precisely because these
memories, contained in Acts, are part of the formal memory of churches today in that they hold
them as part of their canon and read them at their gatherings. Hence that memory of meal sharing
and boundaries can be a meaningful part of any contemporary discussion of Eucharistic sharing
and boundaries.
So it is possible look at meal practice in the churches then and today and see how they relate and
reflect one another; and that is the process that beckons us now if the case of Acts 10­11 is seen
within this then ­ now process of reflection. Whatever way one responds to that reflection, it is
always interesting to bring to attention alterative ancient views of matters that concern us espe-
cially when they come from such figures of authority as an evangelist or from a text that is claimed
unambiguously as part of the canon or from a memory that is directly linked to no less a figure than
the apostle Peter. At the very least, to those who hold that their position is unalterable because of
its grounding in tradition, history can provide a counter-indicative fact that undermines any claim
to doctrinal unanimity on a matter! So what do we see in Acts 10­11? Simply this: eating together
at a common table is basic not only to the baptized but to all humans who fear God (10: 2). Eating
together cannot just be seen as celebrating the bonds of the ecumenical ­ in both senses of the term
­ community of the risen Christ, but is part of the process by which this community is bought into
being in the actual historical situations in which disciples find themselves. Moreover, the welcome
to outsiders to come and share our table is part of the invitation that the disciples of The Way offer
34 Transformation 32(1)
to all human beings who seek God and act uprightly. And, as part of our Christian memory, this
story does not claim `apostolic authority'but as Luke relates it with visions and voices: it claims to
be part of a specific revelation of God to the church so that it could fulfil its mission of witnessing
out to the end of the earth (Acts 1: 8 and 13: 47). In sum, it serves as a call to churches that do not
practice inter-Christian commensality to ask themselves whether they need to rethink in the light
of the gospel ­ that is, the revealed good news which we proclaim ­ what is the fuller significance
of Christian sharing at table.41

Notes
 1. It is often pointed out thatActs 9: 31­11: 18 can be seen as a unit of text (indeed a possible source used by
Luke) in that it breaks up the account: 9: 1­30 is picked up again in 11: 19­30 and what intervenes (that
is, 9: 31­11: 18) has been dropped into the narrative by Luke (see Jeremias J (1937) Untersuchungen
zum Quellenproblem der Apostelgeschichte [Investigations into the problem of sources in the Acts of the
Apostles]. Zeitschrift für die Neutestamentliche Wissenschaft und die Kunde der älteren Kirche 36: 205­
221; reprinted in Jeremias J (1966) Abba: Studien zur neutestamentliche Theologie und Zeitgeschichte.
Gottingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, pp. 238­255); however, Acts 10­11: 18 can still be seen as a
distinct unit of text in that it deals with an event which began in Caesarea and the direct consequences of
that event.

 9. See Wolter M (2009) Primitive Christianity as a Feast. In: Tuckett C (ed) Feasts and Festivals. Leuven:
Publisher, pp. 171­182. We must avoid thinking that there was some formal distinction (a retrojection of
later liturgical experience in the churches) between `feasts', `community meals', and specifically `reli-
gious' gatherings for `the Eucharist': the core eucharistic activity ­ blessing the Father for his goodness
in Christ ­ was part of the communities regular gathering to eat, and this feast was seen in continuity with
all the meals of Jesus.
10. The language of Acts 10: 12 echoes Gen 1: 24­30; Luke also appears to be using a rhetorical common-
place in mentioning a) four-footed animals, b) reptiles and c) birds; Paul gives a similar list in Rom 1: 23.
11. See Lk 20: 12; 22: 34 and 61; Mk 14: 41; Mt 26: 44; and Jn 21: 17.
12. The participle eiskalesamenos indicates that Peter is recalled as taking the initiative ­ the messengers are
not `barging in' nor `gate crashing' Simon the tanner's hospitality; we are only told what Peter is doing
and we assume that the messengers are responding to Peter.
13. This is the third person singular, aorist active indicative of xenizó: one cannot make an act deliberately
done any clearer.

14. Luke does not need to tell his audience such details as they all knew the extent that people could travel
in a day. Given that he knows that Joppa and Caesarea are both on the coast, he probably knew (or knew
people who knew) how long it would take to get from one place to another: this knowledge is demon-
strated in the time allowed for Peter to travel north to Caesarea with the messengers. Since this is about
30 miles, and in narrative time they have made it less than a day (21 hours which included a night ­ when
no one travelled except in emergencies) we can assume his audience imagined that the trip was made in
great haste ­ it would take them longer than a day to make the return journey with Peter (10: 23b and
24). As late as 1914, the rule of thumb for the distance that could be marched on a road in one day by fit,
trained, infantry was approximately 15 miles.
15. One can find the theme of Jesus' open commensality throughout Luke's gospel, see Smith DE (1987)
Table Fellowship as a Literary Motif in the Gospel of Luke. Journal of Biblical Literature 106: 613­638;
Smith DE (1989) The Historical Jesus at Table. In: Lull DJ (ed) Society of Biblical Literature: 1989
Seminar Papers. Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press, pp. 466­486; and O'Loughlin T (2013) The Eucharist and
the Meals of Jesus. The Japan Mission Journal 67(1): 3­11.
16. See TrebilcoP (2011) Why Did the Early Christians Call Themselves he ekklesia? New Testament Studies
57: 440­460.
17. Acts 2: 14­40 is the most exemplary of these `history of salvation' speeches.
18. See O'Loughlin T (2009) Another post-resurrection meal, and its implications for the early understand-
ing of the Eucharist. In: Rodgers Z, Daly-Denton M and Fitzpatrick-McKinley A (eds) A Wandering
Galilean: Essays in Honour of Seán Freyne. Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, pp. 485­503.
19. Luke Emmaus story (Lk 24) being his paradigm for the presence of the risen Lord in the churches' meal
sharing.
20. Luke does not present it with the exact form he uses in Lk 3: 32, but the sheet comes from an opened
heaven and then a voice is heard. On such phenomena, see Rowland C (1982) The Open Heaven. New
York, NY: SPCK; and also Boring ME (1992) Prophecy (Early Christian). In: Freedman DN (ed) The
Anchor Bible Dictionary. New York, NY: Publisher, pp. 495­502, see especially 497 and 499­500.
21. This is not to assert that Luke knew the Didache in the form we have it ­ though there is nothing which
renders that either impossible or unlikely ­ but merely to point out that the practices which Luke's story
assumes as `commonplace' in early communities have marked similarities to those evidenced in the
Didache.
22. See Draper JA(2007) The Holy Vine of David Made Known to the Gentiles through God's Servant Jesus:
`Christian Judaism' in the Didache. In: Jackson-McCabe M (ed) Jewish Christianity Reconsidered:
Rethinking Ancient Groups and Texts. Minneapolis, MN: Publisher, pp. 257­283.
23. On this pattern of thrice-daily prayer, see O'Loughlin T (2010) The Didache: A Window on the Earliest
Christians. Grand Rapids, MI: SPCK and Hendrickson, pp. 66­84; that Peter's prayer at the sixth hour
may correspond to the horarium of the Didache was first suggested by K Lake and HJ Cadbury in their
commentary on Acts in Foakes Jackson FJ and Lake K (eds) (1933) The Beginnings of Christianity: Part
1, The Acts of the Apostles. London: Macmillan, pp. 4, 114.
24. See McGowan AB (1997) Naming the feast: The agape and the diversity of early Christian meals.
Studia Patristica 30: 314­318; and McGowan AB (1999) Ascetic Eucharists: Food and Drink in Early
Christian Ritual Meals. Oxford: Oxford University Press.
25. One might point to Mt 7: 6 as `the basis' of the Didache's statement, but this would be to conclude too
hastily ­ all we can say is that the Didache and Mt reflect a common tradition: see Garrow AJP (2004)
The Gospel of Matthew's Dependence on the Didache. London: T. and T. Clark; and, for an alternative
view, see Tuckett CM (2005) The Didache and the Synoptics Once More: A Response to Aaron Milavec.
Journal of Early Christian Studies 13: 509­518 to be read along with Milavec A (2005) A Rejoinder.
Journal of Early Christian Studies 13: 519­523.
26. To see the force of the image of `dogs'one needs to look at this catena of texts: Didache 9: 5; Mk 7: 27­8
with parallel Mt 15: 26­7; Mt 7: 6; Phil 3: 2; and Rev 22: 15 ­ `dogs' are representative of the Gentiles,
those who are wicked, those who are not part of God's first choice, and outsiders.
27. See Lindbeck G (1999) The Eucharist Tastes Bitter in the Divided Church. Spectrum 19: 1­5.

28. Catholic Bishops Conferences of England and Wales, Ireland, and Scotland (1998) One Bread One Body.
London: Catholic Truth Society ­ this is typical of many such statements that reiterate the impossibility
of intercommunion (except in individual and extra-ordinary circumstances) prior to external canonical
union between the Catholic Church and other `ecclesial communities'.
29. See Ware K (1978) Church and Eucharist, Communion and Intercommunion. Sobornost 7: 550­567
­ again this is cited as a typical example of the position of those ancient churches who do not see them-
selves in formal communion with either the Church of Rome or the churches of the Reformation.
30. Lk 22: 19; and 1 Cor 11: 24 and 25.
31. See McGowan AB (1997) Naming the feast: The agape and the diversity of early Christian meals.
Studia Patristica 30: 314­831; and McGowan AB (1999) Ascetic Eucharists: Food and Drink in Early
Christian Ritual Meals. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 21­22; where he notes that in much schol-
arship the agape became a `convenient dumping ground for all the unwanted meal evidence of the first
few centuries'.
32. Gregory Dix, one of the most influential writers on liturgy in English in the 20th century, sidelined the
Didache (and so all other evidence relating to any continuity between ordinary meals and the Eucharist
in a single footnote in his greatest work; Dix G (1948) The Shape of the Liturgy. London: Dacre Press, p.
48, note 2). On the background to why there was such resistance from many churches ­ of all theologi-
cal shades ­ to the notion that the Eucharistic activity of early Christians took place at their ordinary
meal gatherings, see O'Loughlin T (2013) Reactions to the Didache in Early Twentieth-century Britain:
A Dispute over the Relationship of History and Doctrine? In: Brown SJ, Knight F, and Morgan-Guy J
(eds) Religion, Identity and Conflict in Britain: From the Restoration to the Twentieth Century. Essays in
Honour of Keith Robbins. Farnham: Ashgate, pp. 177­194.
33. The literature is too vast to list here but four works from different perspectives illustrate the new
approach: Smith DE and Taussig H (1990) Many Tables: The Eucharist in the New Testament and
Liturgy Today. London: SCM Press; Smith DE (2003) From Symposium to Eucharist: The Banquet in
the Early Christian World. Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press; Witherington III B (2007) Making a Meal
of it: Rethinking the Theology of the Lord's Supper. Waco, TX: Baylor University Press; Bradshaw P
and Johnson ME (2011) The Origins of Feasts, Fasts and Seasons in Early Christianity. London: Alcuin
Club / SPCK.
34. This would be a `theology of development' (designed as a tool of apologetics by systematicians) been
`back engineered' to produce a hypothetical history (a process I would consider invalid as part of an
historian's methodology and confusing when used by theologians); on this method and the obfuscation
it caused in theological debate, see O'Loughlin T (2012) Divisions in Christianity: The Contribution of
`Appeals to Antiquity'. In: Oliver S, Kilby K and O'Loughlin T (eds) Faithful Reading: New Essays in
Theology and Philosophy in Honour of Fergus Kerr OP. London: T. & T. Clark, 221­241.
35. See Hollander HW (2009) The Idea of Fellowship in 1 Corinthians 10: 14­22. New Testament Studies
55: 456­740.
36. This is explored in O'Loughlin T (2012) Mark and the Eucharist. The Pastoral Review 8(3): 49­53.
37. We see this in the way that Luke presents his story of Paul speaking at a meal (`when we met to break the
loaf' [arton]) in Troas in Acts 20: 7­12; on the rendering as `loaf,' see O'Loughlin T (2004) Translating
Panis in a Eucharistic Context: A Problem of Language and Theology. Worship 78: 226­235.
38. See McGowan AB (1999) Ascetic Eucharists: Food and Drink in Early Christian Ritual Meals. Oxford:
Oxford University Press.
39. This continuity is implicit in most contemporary writing on early Christian meal practice, but it is made
explicit in Smith DE (1987) Table Fellowship as a Literary Motif in the Gospel of Luke. Journal of
Biblical Literature 106: 613­616; and Smith DE (1989) The Historical Jesus at Table. In: Lull DJ (ed)

Author biography
Thomas O'Loughlin is Professor of Historical Theology in the University of Nottingham, and his area of
expertise lies in the evolution of Christian self-understanding in the early centuries of Christianity. His next
major book, The Eucharist: Origins and Contemporary Understandings, will appear in November 2014 and
will deal with how early meal practices mutated to become the liturgical ritual of the Eucharist.
