Are we measuring what we want to measure?
Individual consistency in survey response in rural Malawi
Simona Bignami-Van Assche 1
Abstract
This paper uses reinterview data collected by a household survey conducted in rural
Malawi in 2001 to examine the extent of individual consistency in response to questions
about HIV/AIDS and other topics. The nature and implications of individual
inconsistency in survey response are further analyzed by evaluating covariates of
individual consistency, and the implications of inconsistency for univariate and
multivariate estimates. I find that the reinterviewed respondents are overall consistent in
their answers and that, when there are inconsistencies, they do not significantly affect
the conclusions that can be drawn from multivariate analyses of the survey data.

1. Introduction
Since the earliest days of social science research, there has been a methodological
interest in the possible biasing effects of the data collection process, particularly
individual response error and response effects (Note 1). This interest was ultimately
related to the validity concerns that measurement raises in the social sciences, that is,
the degree to which a set of indicators measures the concept it is intended to measure
(Zeller and Carmines 1980: 13-14).
In the 1960s, the increasingly widespread use of the survey interview method for
fertility studies in developing countries highlighted the need to assess the results of
these studies in terms of the reliability and stability of the responses obtained.
Following the pioneer work of Westoff, Potter and Sagi (1961) in the US, reinterview
studies were done on the reliability and stability of questions about knowledge, attitude
and practice of contraception (Poti, Chakraborti and Malaker 1962; Mauldin 1965;
Green 1969; Stoeckel and Choudhury 1969; Coombs 1977) and family planning
(Stycos and Back 1964; Freedman and Takeshita 1969; Muckerjee 1975; Knodel and
Piampiti 1977). These studies shared several conclusions about survey response error in
demographic surveys carried out in developing countries. First, response error varies
according to respondent characteristics, and to the content and psychological nature of
the questions asked. More personal, sensitive questions tend to be less reliable than
questions pertaining to relatively concrete factual matters (Knodel and Piampiti 1977).
Second, although reporting at the aggregate level may appear to be relatively reliable, it
often masks a high level of individual-level inconsistency. There is contradictory
evidence, however, about whether these individual errors are randomly or
systematically distributed (Coombs 1977: 255). Third, response error is high enough for
some variables (even in factual data) to give reasons for concern (Muckerjee 1975: 142;
Knodel and Piampiti 1977: 65). Fourth, response error might be seriously affected by
differences in the willingness of respondents to participate in the survey process and to
answer questions truthfully, and the respondents vary in the tendency to distort their
responses (Stycos and Back 1964). Finally, reports of female respondents on factual
items (such as age, number of pregnancies, number of children ever born) are as stable
as male reports, but reports on behavioral items (such as ideal family size and
contraceptive use) are more stable for males than for females, and reports on attitudinal
items are more stable for females than males (Mukherjee 1975: 140-141).
This spate of studies culminated in the Response Error Project of the World
Fertility Survey (WFS) that, right from the start, placed great emphasis on the need for
assessing non-sampling error in survey data (O'Muircheartaigh 1982:5). The Response
Error Project comprised studies in Peru (O'Muircheartaigh 1984a), Lesotho
(O'Muircheartaigh 1984b), the Dominican Republic and Turkey (Note 2), and used
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 3
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 79
reinterview designs to determine response reliability of key measures, such as children
ever born, birth intervals and ever-use of contraception. The Response Error Project,
and a separate evaluation of the data collected by the WFS in Indonesia (MacDonald,
Simpson and Whitfield 1978), obtained encouraging results on the quality of the WFS
data, most often confirming the conclusions reached by previous analyses on the
reliability of demographic surveys. For this reason, when the Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS) succeeded the WFS and became the most widely used demographic
surveys in developing countries, there were fewer reinterview studies to assess the
reliability and stability of demographic data collected. As it can be seen in Table 1,
the most recent demographic literature contains only sparse attempts in that direction
(Note 3).

The studies shown in Table 1 tend to focus on the reliability and stability of few
survey items, such as ages and dates, number of children ever born and contraceptive
use. This circumstance is particularly relevant for survey questions on HIV/AIDS. Most
of the currently available information on attitudes and behaviors towards HIV/AIDS
and on patterns and trends in HIV/AIDS in developing countries comes from reports in
sample surveys: the DHS, the Behavioral Surveillance Surveys, and the Multiple
Indicator Cluster Surveys (Note 4). The questions asked in these surveys are extremely
sensitive, and thus prone to high response error (Bignami et al., this volume). However,
a thorough examination of the survey literature reveals that the reliability and stability
of questions on HIV/AIDS has never been evaluated. Besides, in the literature little
attention is paid to evaluate the implications of individual inconsistency not only for
univariate distributions and means, but also for multivariate estimates. This might be an
important problem for analyses that use the DHS data or data from similar surveys.
In addition, the studies shown in Table 1 adopt survey designs that differ from the
main survey in both the choice of the interviewers, the respondents, and the length (and
sometimes even wording) of the questionnaire (Note 5). Existing studies on the
reliability and stability of survey data generally use a shortened version of the original
questionnaire in the reinterviews (with few exceptions, e.g. Westoff, Goldman and
Moreno 1990), so that the questions that are repeated are necessarily taken out of the
questionnaire context in which they had been asked originally. Besides, the interviewers
who carry out the reinterviews have normally undergone different selection procedures
than the interviewers employed in the main survey. For example, it is not uncommon
that only the best interviewers (Curtis and Arnold 1994) or the interviewer supervisory
staff (Coombs 1977) are chosen to carry out the reinterviews, so that the general
reliability of the data are likely to be overestimated. Finally, existing studies that have
evaluated response reliability have sometimes been based on specialized samples (e.g.
Muckerjee 1975; Westoff, Goldman and Moreno 1990; Curtis and Arnold 1994), which
reduces the generalizability of the results to the whole sample included in the original
survey.
The 2001 wave of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project collected
reinterview data for a small subsample of respondents in the southern region of Malawi,
because an initial error in drawing the sample for the survey led to the duplication of
some respondents' names on the lists used by the interviewers, so that some
respondents were accidentally selected twice to participate in the survey. This
unplanned selection procedure guaranteed that respondents were reinterviewed under
the exact same survey conditions of the first interview. The reinterview data permit
measuring individual consistency in response to survey questions on HIV/AIDS, as
well as other topics. In addition, it is possible to evaluate the impact of individual
inconsistency in univariate as well as multivariate estimates.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and methods used
for the analysis. The evidence concerning the individual consistency in survey response
of the respondents in the selected sample (with particular focus on questions on
HIV/AIDS) is then presented in Section 3. In Section 4 and 5, respectively, the
covariates and implications of individual inconsistency in survey response are analyzed.
Finally, the results are discussed and a brief conclusion is provided.
2. Data and methods
2.1 Data sources
The data for the analysis come from reinterviews carried out in the context of the
second wave of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP), a
household panel survey that examines the role of social networks in changing attitudes
and behavior regarding family size, family planning, and HIV/AIDS in rural Malawi.
The first round of the MDICP (Malawi 1) was carried out in the summer of 1998, and
interviewed 1541 ever-married women of childbearing age and 1065 husbands of the
currently married women in three Malawi districts: Balaka in South, Mchinji in the
Centre and Rumphi in the North. In the summer of 2001, the second round of the
survey (Malawi 2) followed-up the same respondents (if still eligible), and also
interviewed all their new spouses (Watkins et al., this volume).
The focus of the MDICP questionnaire is on family planning, AIDS and social
networks, with other questions about basic socio-economic information (age, education,
income and wealth), and about women's autonomy, children, contraception and
marriage. Most questions on background characteristics, family planning and attitudes
and behaviors towards HIV/AIDS are modeled on WHS/DHS questions (Note 6). The
questionnaire for Malawi 2 also included a section on sexual partnerships, which was
expected to be a sensitive issue given the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the
country and the emphasis of prevention programs on marital fidelity (Table 2). All
questions are fixed-coded, and there are no open-ended questions asked to the
respondents. The questionnaire was first designed in English, by drawing on qualitative
research (semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and field-testing) that had been
carried out in the research areas to refine the questions' content and wording. The
questionnaire was then translated in the local languages (Yao, Chichewa, and
Tumbuka) from the original English-language model by a group of university-educated
English-speaking supervisors who had first been extensively trained with respect to the
objectives of the project and the meanings of the questions.

a For both males and females, the number of questions in the marriage history section is 31, which can all refer to up to three
spouses. The total number of questions in this section thus might range from 31 (one spouse) to 93 (three spouses).
b In 2001, for both males and females the total number of questions in the family planning section is 33, which includes a subset of
questions (14) that could refer up to four network partners. The total number of questions in this section thus ranges from 33
(one network partner) to 75 (four network partners).
c The total number of questions in the AIDS section is 34, which includes a subset of questions (16) that could refer up to four
network partners. Within this subset of questions, however, 13 questions were not asked if the network partners were the same
as those in the family planning section. The total number of questions for the AIDS section thus ranges from 34 (one network
partner, same as that in the family planning section) to 95 (four network partners, all different from those in the family planning
section).
The interviewers were males and females hired locally, so that they were generally of
the same ethnic group and engaged in the same type of occupation of the respondents
(e.g. farming, small businesses). Before fieldwork started in each region, the
interviewers were given formal training conducted in the local language of the
questionnaires (Chichewa and Yao in the Southern region; Chichewa in the Central
Region; and Tumbuka in the Northern region). Because of these linguistic differences
across the three Malawian regions, the interviewing teams were not the same for the
two rounds or even for the three districts in each round, although some interviewers
participated in more than one district (if they were able to speak more than one
language) and/or in more than one round.
The questionnaires were closely checked for missing responses, first in the field by
supervisors, then by the home office at the end of each day of fieldwork. The data entry
team had been instructed to carry on an additional quality check on the questionnaires
before they were entered in electronic form, and automatic checks for errors had been
built into the data entry program. The multiple checks permitted sending the interviewer
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 3
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 83
back to the respondent if missing or inconsistent answers were discovered at any stage
of the quality-check process and, ultimately, ensured a high quality of the data collected
(Watkins et al., this volume).
2.2 Reinterviews
The primary data for this paper consist of a set of reinterviews carried out between June
10 and July 5, 2001, by administering more than once (Note 7) the same Malawi 2
questionnaire to 96 women and 38 men in Balaka District, the first of the three sites to
be surveyed (Table 3).

*Sample sizes refer to respondents interviewed in Balaka District.
The reinterviews were not planned--rather, they were carried out as a result of one
of the problems that may arise while doing survey research. At the beginning of
fieldwork, a glitch in the software used to draw the sampling frame led to a duplication
of respondents' names on the lists used by the interviewers in Balaka District (Note 8).
As a result, some male respondents were re-interviewed in 11 villages of the 22
sampled, and some female respondents were re-interviewed in 15 villages of the 32
sampled (Note 9). The problem was eventually identified and solved during the initial
weeks of fieldwork (Note 10). Since the reinterviews were unplanned, their study
design was the same as that of the main survey in the choice of the respondents and the
interviewers, and in the length and wording of the questionnaire.
To verify that interviews were carried out with the same person, five identifying
characteristics had to be the same in the main interview and in the reinterview:
respondent's name, father's name, spouse's name, residence and birthplace. On the
basis of these criteria, the reinterviews carried out with 11 women and 11 men were
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 3
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
84 http://www.demographic-research.org
deleted because they appeared, despite the same claimed name, not to be the same
individual.
Background characteristics for respondents interviewed once in the Malawi 2
sample for Balaka District and for the final sample of respondents interviewed twice in
2001 are displayed in Table 4. It can be noticed that male and female reinterviewed
respondents tend to be less educated and poorer (as measured by the possession of a
radio) than the respondents who were interviewed only once. Re-interviewed male
respondents are also slightly older and re-interviewed females slightly younger than
respondents interviewed once. Similar selectivity effects among the reinterviewed
respondents are found by most reinterview studies (e.g. O'Muircheartaigh 1984a,
1984b; Westoff, Goldman and Moreno 1990; Curtis and Arnold 1994; Note 11).
Given the unplanned design of the experiment the reinterview period for the
duplicate interviews varied, being on average 9.7 days for males and 9.2 days for
females (see Table 3). By minimizing the chances for genuine change to occur in
attitudes and in behavioral characteristics between interviews (Note 12), such a short
time interval approximates quite well the "instant replay" of the original survey
conditions, which provides the best indicator of reliability but is rarely possible to
achieve outside the laboratory (Coombs 1977: 218). However, such a short interval
between interviews increases the chance that the respondent (or the interviewer, if the
same) will remember the responses given in the original interview and simply repeat
them in the duplicate interview.
Another consequence of the unplanned design of the reinterview was that the
interviewers were not aware if a certain respondent had already been interviewed,
unless the interviewer was the same in both interviews or the respondents themselves
told the interviewer they had already been interviewed. This happened only in few
cases, however. The interviewer was the same in 9 cases; in only 26 cases did the
respondents explicitly state they had already been interviewed when the interviewer
went to reinterview them (these were generally the more educated and richer
respondents). Interestingly enough, in only one case an interviewer who reinterviewed
the same respondent mentioned the first interview in a comment at the end of the
questionnaire ("The interview was good, as it was a revision for what we did a week
ago", H91003).

2.3 Methods
The analysis of individual consistency in responses for the Malawi 2 reinterview data is
divided in three parts.
First, for all pairs of non-missing responses provided by the reinterviewed
respondents in both the main and the duplicate interview, individual consistency is
estimated by means of an ad hoc scoring system, which assigns "consistency scores" to
each respondent in the following way. The survey items are grouped according to
questionnaire section (Note 13) and, for each section, the maximum consistency score is
set equal to the total number of survey items in that section. From this maximum value,
a "point" is deducted for each inconsistent (Note 14) answer. For each section, the
minimum consistency score that can be achieved is thus zero, if the respondent answers
inconsistently to all survey items in the section. The sum of the score totals within each
section and across all sections gives the individual's total consistency score, and allows
sorting respondents by their level of inconsistency and type of questions. Ultimately,
this scoring system allows assessing individual consistency with reference to the
`whole' survey experience, rather than for isolated questions as it is normally done in
the literature. However, in order to contrast the results of this study with those of other
studies, the percentages of inconsistent respondents for a selected number of
comparable survey items are also calculated.
Then, special attention is devoted to assessing the reliability and stability of
questions about attitudes and behaviors towards HIV/AIDS. In order to do so, I
calculate the crude index of disagreement (Note 15) for a set of ten questions asked in
the Malawi 2 questionnaire, which include three questions asked in DHS surveys.
Finally, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the nature and implications of
individual inconsistencies in survey response, some covariates of individual consistency
(the reinterview period, individual item non-response, and the questions' content) are
analyzed, and the implications of inconsistencies for univariate and multivariate data
analyses are evaluated
3. Are the MDICP respondents consistent in their answers?
3.1 Consistency scores
Descriptive statistics for the consistency scores are presented in Table 5. The minimum
consistency score is slightly lower for males than for females whereas the opposite is
true for the maximum score, thus indicating that males exhibit higher variability in
response than females.

The table shows that overall respondents interviewed twice in 2001 tend to be
fairly consistent in their answers. Across all questionnaire sections, for both men and
women there are no respondents with less than 40% of consistent answers.
Correspondingly, between 60% and 80% of the answers given by the greatest majority
of respondents interviewed twice in 2001 are consistent. Only for questions on
partnerships does the percentage of respondents in the first quintile exceed 10% of the
total number of reinterviewed respondents; and only for questions on HIV/AIDS the
percentage of individuals in the top quintile is close to zero. The lowest consistency is
therefore observed for the most sensitive questions, namely those on partnerships and
on HIV/AIDS.
It can also be seen in Table 6 that the level of individual consistency exhibits
significant differences by gender. Comparing the bottom, intermediate and top score
quintiles, shows that males are less consistent than females in reporting about family
planning, gender and partnerships, but more consistent in reporting about children.
However, when the data in Table 6 are graphed (Figure 1), the pattern of individual
consistency is quite similar for men and women, with the exception of questions on
family planning, children and HIV/AIDS.
To compare individual consistency in rural Malawi with the results of other
studies, Table 7 presents the crude index of disagreement for selected survey items for
Malawi together with those obtained from the WFS reinterview studies in Indonesia,
Peru and Lesotho, and from the DHS reinterview study carried out in Pakistan. The
comparison is limited to women, since the indicated WFS and DHS did not sample
men. The table shows that the percentage of discrepant cases is equivalent in Malawi
and in the other countries considered for family planning variables. Discrepant
responses on ages and dates of birth are fewer in Indonesia and in Malawi than in any
other country, thus suggesting that a low level of female education and literacy in
Malawi is not associated with poor date reporting, as it happens in Pakistan (Curtis and
Arnold 1994: 17). In contrast, reporting of dates of marriage in Malawi is worse only in
Pakistan. This is most likely due to the high marital mobility in Malawi (Reniers, this
volume) as compared to the other countries considered, which is supported by the fact
that the percentage of discrepant cases on current marital status and number of times
married is consistently higher in Malawi than in the other studies. Finally, the reporting
on the number of children ever born tends to be worse in Malawi, although the
reporting on the number of living children is identical in Malawi and in Pakistan. This
suggests that underreporting of dead children might be particularly serious in Malawi.

3.2 Consistency in reporting on HIV/AIDS
The crude index of disagreement for questions on HIV/AIDS is presented in Table 8. It
can first be noticed that individual inconsistency is always higher for females than for
males, with the exception of two questions. However, the pattern of inconsistencies is
similar for both sexes. Questions on the respondent's sources of information about
AIDS (clinic/radio) are the most reliable, with more than 95 per cent of respondents
answering they had heard about AIDS from at least one of these sources. Respondents
are also highly consistent in responding to the question on whether they think a healthy-
looking person can be infected with AIDS. The percentage of inconsistent responses is
highest for questions about the respondent's own chance of being currently infected
with AIDS, or becoming infected in the future. For both sexes, the main cause for the
high inconsistency rate is the shift of "don't know" answers to "no likelihood" or "some
likelihood" answers in the reinterview (not shown). Since there is no evidence that the
interviewers were better trained in the reinterview survey, it is difficult to interpret this
result. The percentage of respondents with discrepant responses on worry about getting
AIDS is also high. The inconsistencies are mostly due to the fact that, in the
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 3
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 91
reinterview, respondents' worry changes towards more extreme categories; those who
were worried a little move towards being not worried at all or worried a lot (not shown).
This trend to extremes parallels that of the question on becoming infected with AIDS in
the future, and it is difficult to interpret since there is no systematic tendency for the
respondents in the aggregate to be more (or less) worried in the reinterview. Finally,
men are more consistent than women in answering whether STDs increase chances of
getting AIDS, and whether it is acceptable to use a condom with the spouse. In Section
5, the implications of these discrepancies for the aggregate distribution of the survey
items considered are discussed.

4. Covariates of individual consistency
To identify covariates of individual consistency net of the bias introduced by the choice
of the relevant individual characteristics to include for the analysis (those reported in
the first interview, rather than in the reinterview), I focus on three variables independent
of the choice of the relevant interview: the reinterview period, individual item non-
response, and the questions' content (if the question asks the respondents to report
about themselves or about third parties).
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 3
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
92 http://www.demographic-research.org
For both males and females, the length of the reinterview period does not seem to
be an important covariate of individual consistency. Indeed, the average consistency
score does not vary much with the length of the reinterview period (Table 9a), and the
individual scores of most reinterviewed respondents fall into the fourth quintile,
regardless of the reinterview period (Table 9b).

Item non-response differs between reinterviewed respondents and respondents
interviewed only once in 2001, although item non-response is overall quite low (less
than 1%, Note 16). Reinterviewed respondents (and, especially, females) give in fact
less complete answers than respondents interviewed only once in 2001 (Table 10).

Note. The percentages illustrate above are standardized for the number of respondents with whom a complete interview was carried
out and the number of questions within each section (or in the whole questionnaire).
On the one hand, this might be due to a genuine difference in non-response, and
thus ultimately be related to the different willingness of respondents to answer the
questions a second time. If this is the case, non-response should be associated with
individual inconsistency. On the other hand, the observed differences in non-response
might be random, or be generated by the different effectiveness of the checking of
questionnaires for errors that was done in the field. In this case, non-response should
show no association with individual consistency. A close analysis reveals that the first
hypothesis is the correct one (Table 11). The greatest percentage of inconsistent
answers (between 20 and 40%) is, in fact, concentrated among respondents with less
than 2% of missing answers in main and/or duplicate interview--these percentage of
missing answers being the highest recorded in the sample (see Table 10). Item non-
response it thus an importance covariate of individual consistency.

In the Malawi 2 questionnaire respondents were asked questions about their best
friends' extramarital relationships, use of family planning and worry about AIDS. In
order to assess if respondents tend to be more consistent in reports about their own
characteristics rather than others' characteristics, I focus on a set of three fixed-coded
questions about extramarital relationships and worry of AIDS that were asked to each
respondent, with the same wording, in reference to themselves and their best married
friends (Note 17).
As can be seen in Table 12, the questions' content is an important covariate of
individual consistency. When reinterviewed, more than 90% of respondents provide the
same answer when questioned whether or not they had an extramarital relationship;
whereas only 60% of females and 32% of males provides the same answer when
questioned whether or not their best married friend had an extramarital relationship. In
addition, more males than females assess consistently their own and their best married
friend's chance of being infected with AIDS; although overall consistency about the
present and future chance of being infected with AIDS is quite low (as discussed
earlier). Lower consistency in reporting about others can be related to the fact that the
"best married" friend identified in the two interviews was different; or to the fact that
the respondents are genuinely uncertain about the AIDS worry of their friends.

5. Implications of individual inconsistency for data analysis
Even if most Malawi 2 reinterviewed respondents are consistent in their answers,
what are the implications of inconsistency for the conclusions that can be drawn from
the data? In order to answer this question, I focus on reporting of selected outcome and
control variables. I begin with univariate comparisons of distributions and means. Then,
I also test whether multivariate regression coefficients are affected by the degree of
consistency in the duplicate interview.
5.1 Comparison of distributions and means for selected outcome and control
variables
For respondent's age, number of children ever born and age at first sex intercourse, the
comparison of reports given in the main and the duplicate interview presented in Figure
2 shows that the difference in the selected characteristics is very symmetrical around
the central peak: this suggests that, if there is misreporting, it is random rather than
systematic (Curtis and Arnold 1994).

In addition, the means of the control variables whose distribution is graphed in
Figure 2 do not differ significantly between the main survey and the reinterview (Table
13). The same consideration applies to the means of all other variables considered in
Table 13 with the exception of some questions on HIV/AIDS, which, for females, differ
significantly between the main interview and the reinterview. These questions are those
for which the percentage of inconsistent responses is highest (see Table 8).

5.2 Effects on multivariate regression coefficients
To test whether multivariate regression coefficients are affected by inconsistency I
conducted a series of BGLW tests, in which the value of an outcome variable in the
main survey was regressed on predetermined control variables for the main survey and
individual inconsistency on the outcome variable considered (Note 18). In other terms,
the test is whether the slope coefficients of the outcome variable and the constant differ
when the value of the outcome variable is reported inconsistently between the main
interview and the reinterview (Note 19). The analysis is limited to women, since the
main aim is to investigate whether the univariate difference in means observed above
(see Table 13) is associated with significant difference in multivariate estimates.

Multivariate probits and OLS regressions for testing impact of inconsistency on
currently using contraceptives, being worried of getting AIDS and the number of
children surviving are displayed in Table 14. It can be noticed that no BGLW test is
significant: individual inconsistency on the outcome variable of interest does not bias
multivariate regression coefficients for the variables considered.
6. Conclusion
There is considerable consistency in the answers of the respondents interviewed twice
in the 2001 Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project: for most of them, between
60% and 80% of their responses are consistent. Consistency shows significant
differences by gender: males are less consistent than females in reporting about family
planning, gender and partnerships, but they are more consistent in reporting about
children.
The level of inconsistencies found in Malawi for family planning variables is
within the same range of that calculated by other reinterview studies in developing
countries. In addition, discrepancies on ages and dates of birth suggest that a low level
of female education and literacy in Malawi is not associated with poor date reporting in
Malawi 2, as it happens in other cases (such as in the Pakistan DHS). However,
inconsistency in reporting of dates of marriage is more serious for Malawi 2 than for
other studies, which is most likely due to higher marital mobility in Malawi.
In the Malawi 2 reinterview data, the lowest consistency is observed for the most
sensitive questions, namely those on HIV/AIDS. The percentage of inconsistent
responses is highest for questions about the respondent's own chance of being currently
infected with AIDS or becoming infected in the future, and the question on
respondent's worry of getting AIDS. Individual inconsistency is always higher for
females than for males, but the pattern of inconsistencies is similar for both sexes.
Several of the AIDS questions were taken from the core questionnaire of the DHS,
which have been asked in many African countries. Although to my knowledge the DHS
has not conducted reinterview studies to evaluate the consistency of these questions, the
results of the present analysis suggest that analysts of AIDS questions in the DHS need
to be cautious in the interpretation of their descriptive results (especially for females).
Clearly, consistency cannot be taken as a guarantee of accuracy (to give answers
that reflect the "true" value of a certain variable), because stereotypical responses and
intentional misstatements could be repeated, and because some individuals who gave
consistent reports may have remembered the answers they gave in the first interview
(Knodel and Piampiti 1977:55). The latter possibility can reasonably be excluded,
however, since the length of the reinterview period is virtually uncorrelated with
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 3
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 101
individual consistency. In the majority of cases, respondents are inconsistent on
questions they are probably genuinely ambivalent or anxious about, or for which they
do not have a firm answer: for example, sensitive questions and reports about
characteristics of others. In addition, only a small percentage of inconsistent individuals
(less than 2%) show also higher item non-response, or a lower willingness to answer the
questions altogether.
An important results of the analysis presented in this paper is that inconsistency
does not affect the conclusions that can be drawn from the survey data, since: (a) the
distribution and means of a number of outcome and control variables do not differ
significantly between the main interview and the reinterview, with the exception of
some questions on HIV/AIDS for which the percentage of discrepant responses is
highest; and (b) even when the means differ, the coefficients estimates for standard
family background variables in regression and probit equations are not biased by
individual inconsistency.

Notes
1. Individual response error is the inaccurate measurement that occurs when a
recorded answer deviates from the `true' value for the individual. Response effects
are represented by anything that causes inaccurate measurement.
2. According to O'Muircheartaigh (1982), a total of 560 and 936 respondents from,
respectively, the Turkish Fertility Study and the Dominican Republic Fertility
Survey were successfully reinterviewed. Country reports on these two reinterview
studies were, however, never published.
3. Some of the recent literature on survey response error in developing countries has
evaluated data accuracy in terms of expected patterns in demographic behaviors.
For example, reports of contraceptive use from contraceptive histories have been
used to recreate estimates of current use from a prior survey and then compared to
the observed data to evaluate accuracy in reporting at the earlier date (Curtis 1995;
Stanton et al. 1997).
4. These surveys (together with the Reproductive Health Surveys and the Sexual
Behavior Surveys) are the main sources of HIV/AIDS indicators for the HIV/AIDS
Survey Indicators Database, implemented by Macro International with support
from USAID and UNICEF (http://www.measuredhs.com/hivdata/start.cfm). The
indicators included are derived from the "UNAIDS National AIDS Programmes:
Guide to Monitoring and Evaluation" (UNAIDS 2000) and include a number of
indicators identified to monitor the goals set at the UN General Assembly Special
Session on HIV/AIDS in 2000.
5. Even when reliability studies are designed to ensure that the fieldwork conditions
resemble those of the main survey (such as in the WFS Response Error Project), in
practice "the basic condition of comparability--the essential survey conditions
being the same for the two interviews" is generally violated (O' Muircheartaigh,
1984b: 11).
6. Various questions on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors towards HIV/AIDS were
first introduced in the 1988 Botswana DHS (Botswana Central Statistical Office
and ORC/Macro 1989) and in the 1988 Zimbabwe DHS (Zimbabwe Central
Statistical Office and ORC/Macro 1989). A set of eight questions on HIV/AIDS
(heard of AIDS; sources of information on HIV/AIDS; what to do to avoid AIDS;
safe sex; healthy-looking person can have AIDS; is AIDS a fatal disease; personal
chances of getting AIDS; changed behavior because of AIDS) was then introduced
as standard in the third phase of the DHS (Institute for Resource
Development/Macro International 1995a, 1995b).

7. In two cases the interview was carried out three times with the same woman. The
two triplets were, however, discarded from the total number of reinterviews for the
purposes of the present analysis.
8. It is difficult to evaluate if the duplication of respondents' names occurred
randomly, since the supervisors did not keep track of the respondents who refused
to be reinterviewed. However, the reinterviewed respondents do not show any
clustering by place of residence, marital status or other identifying characteristics.
In addition, there was likely no systematic bias due to the interviewers: each day
they were given a list of those to interview and, if the respondent refused, they
would have reported that to the survey team.
9. The villages not subject to the duplication problem are excluded when comparisons
are made between those interviewed twice and those interviewed only once.
10. The difficulty in identifying the problem was complicated by the fact that another
research project (not related to the MDICP) was being carried out in the research
area at the same time of Malawi 2, so that when respondents began to declare that
they had already been interviewed it was unclear by which project.
11. It is unclear why some respondents agreed to be reinterviewed in Malawi 2. The
fact that reinterviewed respondents are less educated than the other respondents in
the sample suggests that they were perhaps less confident in refusing the second
interview, or less able to understand that they had already participated in the same
survey. The fact that respondents interviewed twice are poorer than respondents
interviewed once might also indicate that their decision to participate again in the
survey was dictated by the additional gift they were provided for the second
interview.
12. Indeed, one of the main purposes of the MDICP is to measure change in a number
of key variables, so that when interpreting the extent of inconsistency in responses,
it is necessary to consider the influence of any real change that might have taken
place. Of course, some characteristics of respondents (such as year of birth, age at
first marriage, or ethnicity) are fixed and cannot change over time, while others
(such as education or occupation) may change.
13. The grouping by questionnaire's section was chosen because each section refers to
a specific topic and contains a particular type of questions (factual and
attitudinal/behavioral; see Table 2).
14. An answer is coded as inconsistent if the value recorded in the first interview is
different from the value recorded in the second interview, regardless of the
response categories. The individual consistency score is, in fact, not sensitive to
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 3
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
104 http://www.demographic-research.org
different ways of defining inconsistency across questions with different response
categories.
15. The crude index of disagreement measures the percentage of cases with different
responses in the main interview and in the reinterview (Curtis and Arnold 1994: 7).
16. Item non-response for selected questions (such as age, education, age at first
intercourse) falls within the same range of that calculated by the 2000 Malawi
Demographic and Health Survey (National Statistical Office and ORC Macro
2001).
17. For males, these questions were asked with reference to the best male married
friend; for females, they were asked with reference to the best female married
friend.
18. Based on Becketti, Gould, Lillard and Welch (1988). BGLW tests are used in
attrition analysis to test whether the coefficients of the predetermined variables and
the constant differ for those respondents who are subsequently lost to follow-up
versus those who are re-interviewed (Alderman et al. 2001: 103).
19. All the control variables considered are measured consistently for at least 70% of
the respondents.
