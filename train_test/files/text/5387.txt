Introduction
Water and sanitation are important ingredients for sustainable
development. In particular, water is needed for food, energy,
and industrial production (United Nations Water [UN-Water],
2016; World Health Organization [WHO], 2016). Despite the
importance of water to people, it is estimated that by 2050, at
least one in four people, especially in developing countries,
will be affected by infrequent water supply (Marson & Savin,
2015; United Nations Development Programme [UNDP],
2016)--a situation that will potentially undermine people's
health and dignity, and consequently exacerbate the already
precarious economic conditions in those countries.
In recognition of this looming danger, the United Nations
General Assembly in its recently adopted sustainable devel-
opment agenda, known as the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs), correctly sets out to "ensure availability and
sustainable management of water and sanitation for all"
(SDG 6; UNDP, 2015). However, until the much-needed
investments are made in the water sectors of developing
countries, this goal is unlikely to be met. For example, the
UNDP (2015) reports that, until adequate investments are
made in water infrastructure, it will be difficult for water
utilities to ensure universal access to safe and affordable
drinking water for all by 2030.
Water utilities in developing countries are often capital
constrained, and hence, their service provisions as well as
required investment in infrastructure largely depend on cus-
tomers' patronization as reflected in their timely payment of
water bills. If customers default on their payments and/or are
unable to pay their bills in a timely manner, the water utilities
in these countries are more likely to face serious cash flow
problems in maintaining sustainable water services (Sualihu
& Rahman, 2014b). In this backdrop, it is imperative that
water utilities fully appreciate the factors that affect the
patronage behavior of their customers to avoid delayed or
irregular payment of water bills. However, little empirical
research exists in the literature investigating the factors influ-
encing customer decisions when it comes to paying water
bills in time (Mugabi, Kayaga, Smout, & Njiru, 2010). In this
article, we aim to contribute to this strand of the literature by

The Payment Behavior of Water Utility
Customers in the Greater Accra Region
of Ghana: An Empirical Analysis
Mohammed Aminu Sualihu1, M. Arifur Rahman2,
and Zakiya Tofik-Abu3
Abstract
Although water is an essential commodity with virtually no substitute, poor bill payment on the part of water utility customers is
constraining the effort of water utility companies, especially those in developing countries to sustain and expand its provision.
In this backdrop, this article investigates the interrelationship and impact of a set of attitudinal and institutional factors on
the bill payment behavior of water utility customers of Ghana. A conceptual model of payment behavior is developed and
tested using data from a cross-sectional survey of households in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana (GARG) and the billing
records of Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL). Among the constructs considered in the analysis, service quality,
corporate image, and monitoring and control are found to be the major determinants of customer satisfaction toward the
water utility, which in turn, together with the direct influence of monitoring and control measures and transaction time at
bill payment points, explains a significant part of the total variation in water customers' bill payment behavior. We provide
in-depth discussion and policy implications of our findings.

analyzing the influence of a set of attitudinal and institutional
factors on the bill payment behavior of water utility custom-
ers of Ghana, a lower middle-income country.
Following the lead from the service marketing literature,
previous studies (viz., Kayaga, Franceys, & Sansom, 2004)
have tried to understand the effect of different attitudinal vari-
ables such as service value, service quality, corporate image,
and customer satisfaction on customers' loyalty toward water
utility and their bill payment behavior. However, in the con-
text of the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991),
Mugabi et al. (2010) suggest that, in addition to customers'
general attitude toward bill payment, some service issues that
are largely within the control of water utility managers may
also affect their timely bill payment. Therefore, our approach
in this article is more integrated, in the sense that, we study
the effect of some key attitudinal variables and service issues
(which are mainly institutional in nature) simultaneously to
understand the variation in water customers' bill payment
behavior. To this end, we first undertake a review of related
literature to identify a set of important attitudinal and institu-
tional constructs that is not only potentially useful in explain-
ing the actual payment behavior but also quite amenable to
the influence of the water utility. The rationale for these selec-
tion criteria is that, by isolating the factors under its influence,
the water utility would be able to implement more realistic
strategies to promote timely bill payment. Subsequently,
based on the background knowledge from the literature, we
propose and test a conceptual relationship among the factors
considered in the study.
Literature Review
A water utility's failure to collect bills on a timely basis may
result from a range of factors; some of which may be viewed
as entirely under the control of the utility (such as the billing
issues and monitoring and control activities), some only par-
tially under the control of the utility (such as the willingness
of water customers), and some others completely beyond the
control of the utility (such as the social and demographic
profile of the customers). To be consistent with the focus of
the study, this section reviews related literature that helps
identify some factors that a water utility may influence at
least to some meaningful extent.
Customer Satisfaction and Behavioral
Intentions
Customer satisfaction is a consequence of purchase and con-
sumption arising from the buyer's comparison of the rewards
and costs of the purchase in relation to the expected conse-
quences (Bolton & Drew, 1991). Customers are able to tell
whether or not they are satisfied with a product by comparing
the benefits they get from using the product relative to its
costs (Bolton & Drew, 1991). Oliver (1980) notes that cus-
tomer satisfaction or dissatisfaction arises from the difference
between prior expectations and actual performance (Oliver,
1980). Bolton and Drew (1991) argue that expectations, per-
formance appraisals, and disconfirmation are possible deter-
minants of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction, and
conclude that customers' assessments of continuously pro-
vided services, such as water utilities, may depend on only
performance evaluations. Therefore, in the context of this
study, we measure customer satisfaction based on the custom-
ers' evaluation of the performance of the water utility.
In a comprehensive study on the relationship among and
between the major consumer judgmental constructs in the
context of a service industry, Cronin, Brady, and Hult (2000)
show that customer satisfaction is positively associated with
behavioral intentions. The authors' findings are borne out by
the results of several other prior and subsequent studies on
customer satisfaction and various indicators of behavioral
intentions such as customer loyalty, repurchase intention,
and switching behavior (e.g., Andreassen & Lanseng, 1997;
Caruana, 2002; Richard & Zhang, 2012; Srivastava &
Sharma, 2013). Therefore, in the context of a utility com-
pany, it may be argued that the more consumers are satisfied
with service provision, the more likely they are to pay their
bills on time. Sualihu and Rahman (2014b) conclude that
higher customer satisfaction is associated with higher bill
payment. As such, it is hypothesized that customer satisfac-
tion is likely to be positively associated with customers'
behavioral intentions, ceteris paribus.
Service Value and Customer
Satisfaction
In her exploratory study, Zeithaml (1988) suggests that "per-
ceived value is the customer's overall assessment of the util-
ity of a product based on perceptions of what is received and
what is given" (p. 14). If perceived service is comparable
with the concept of perceived product value, then service
value can be considered to involve the trade-off between a
customer's evaluation of the benefits of using a service and
its cost (Bolton & Drew, 1991). Whereas the benefits are
made up of physical attributes, service attributes, and techni-
cal support available from the supplier, the costs are the sac-
rifices the consumer makes when making the purchase
(Kayaga et al., 2004; Ravald & Grönroos, 1996).
Given that service value is crucial for customers in all
successful exchange transactions (Holbrook, 1994), other
things remaining unchanged, customer perception of
improved value in a service encounter is expected to lead to
increased customer satisfaction and more favorable behav-
ioral intentions. In line with this argument, Brand, Cronin,
and Routledge (1997) conclude that there is a positive cor-
relation between service value and customer satisfaction.
Similarly, Cronin et al. (2000) also present evidence of the
role of service value as a causal antecedent of customer sat-
isfaction. In addition, because perceived benefits from using
a service are likely to be influenced by service quality
Sualihu et al. 3
attributes, some studies also emphasize the role of service
value as a mediating variable in the relationship between ser-
vice quality (discussed shortly) and customer satisfaction
(e.g., Bolton & Drew, 1991; Lee, Lee, Lee, Park, & Moon,
2004). Thus, service value is likely to influence customer
satisfaction positively, ceteris paribus.
Service Quality and Customer
Satisfaction
Much of the research on customers' attitude toward services
has focused on perceived service quality (e.g., Dabholkar,
Sheperd, & Thorpe, 2000; Wang & Shieh, 2006). Perceived
quality is seen as a customer's assessment of the overall
excellence or superiority of the service (Zeithaml, 1988).
Accordingly, perceived service quality is the degree to which
a service meets or exceeds customers'expectations. Following
Kayaga et al. (2004), we use a blend of technical quality and
functional quality indices to measure service quality. Whereas
technical quality is what a customer receives in his or her
interaction with the service firm, functional quality describes
how service is delivered to the consumer.
There seems to be a broad consensus emerging in the ser-
vices management literature that service quality is a major
determinant of overall customer satisfaction. Indeed, numer-
ous studies document a significant positive relationship
between these two judgmental constructs in the context of, for
example, the commercial airline industry (Ostrowski,
O'Brien, & Gordon, 1993); a variety of consumer service
firms (Anderson, Fornell, & Lehmann, 1994; Fornell, 1992);
the banking, pest control, dry cleaning, and restaurant ser-
vices (Cronin & Taylor, 1992); the photographic services
(Dabholkar et al., 2000); the professional accounting services
(Hong & Goo, 2004); and the university library services
(Wang & Shieh, 2006). We are not, however, aware of any
study in the context of water utility services that empirically
tests the effect of customers'service quality judgment on out-
come variables such as satisfaction and subsequent behav-
ioral intentions. Therefore, service quality is more likely to
positively influence customer satisfaction, ceteris paribus.
Corporate Image and Customer
Satisfaction
Corporate image is the way an organization is presented to or
perceived by its members and the public (Andreassen &
Lindestad, 1998). Dowling (1986) notes that corporate image
can be aided by the information (communications) provided
by the firm, as well as managerial attitudes and philosophy.
Accordingly, it enables a company to engage more effec-
tively in maintaining and improving the relationship with its
customers, and thereby helps to improve customers' attitude
toward the company. An improved customer attitude is
expected to reflect favorably on customer satisfaction and
behavioral intentions.
Srivastava and Sharma (2013) report a positive associa-
tion between corporate image and customer satisfaction in
the context of Indian telecommunication industry, suggest-
ing that higher corporate image results in a greater customer
satisfaction, which in turn leads to high repurchase intention
and less switching behavior. Similarly, Richard and Zhang
(2012) also report that corporate image has a positive effect
on customer commitment and customer satisfaction in the
New Zealand travel service industry. Thus, in this study, cor-
porate image is likely to positively influence customer satis-
faction, ceteris paribus.
Billing Issues and Payment Behavior
Most utility companies provide bundle of services to their
clients (Grönroos, 1984) and the water utility is no excep-
tion. Hence, issues relating to tariff setting, meter reading,
billing, and payment options form an important part of facili-
tating and support services for water utilities. In an explor-
atory study of five small urban water utilities in Uganda,
Mugabi, Kayaga, and Smout (2007b) identify that bill deliv-
ery, dependability or correctness of meter reading and bills,
clarity of bills, flexibility, and choice in payment options are
among the main factors that customers believe to be the
facilitators of, or barriers to, timely payment of their water
bills. These issues, which we may collectively term as the
billing issues, if not managed properly, may easily add to
customer dissatisfaction and eventually lead to more delayed
payments (or outright nonpayments) and poorer revenue per-
formance for the utility. Chipofya, Hoko, and Gustaff (2009)
argue that utilities do not achieve efficiency in billing because
they do not employ appropriate billing practices. If so, then
one could argue that it is the reason for the abysmal bill pay-
ment on the part of consumers (Sualihu & Rahman, 2014a).
In addition to behavioral and institutional constructs such
as those reviewed in the preceding paragraphs, Mugabi et al.
(2007b) and others (e.g., Kayaga, Calvert, & Sansom, 2003;
Waldron, 2011) argue that some other institutional factors,
namely, transaction time of customers at the bill payment
points and monitoring and control measures on the part of
water utilities, may also play critical independent roles in
determining customers' satisfaction level and their bill pay-
ment behavior. For example, a reduction in the transaction
time at bill collection centers is likely to increase customers'
satisfaction levels and encourage water utility clientele to
pay off their bills on time. Sualihu and Rahman (2014b) find
that a reduction in transaction time at bill collection centers
does not only increase the satisfaction level of customers but
also reduces the number of days it takes utility customers, on
average, to pay off their bills after presentment. Furthermore,
it is also argued that if utility companies step-up their moni-
toring and control roles, they are likely to detect faults such
as metering errors and burst pipes, and fix them on time
(Waldron, 2011). This would not only increase the level of
customer satisfaction toward the water utility but also reduce

the unusual delays in customers' bill payment. Therefore,
transaction time and monitoring and control are more likely
to negatively influence bill payment behavior.
Framework of Analysis
Timely payment of bills can be viewed as a clear manifesta-
tion of patronage intention of water customers. Several
research perspectives suggest customers' behavioral inten-
tion to patronize to be the primary predictor of their actual
patronizing behavior. Many researchers, especially in service
marketing literature, rely on the expectation confirmation
theory (Oliver, 1980) to explain patronizing behavior, and
suggest customer satisfaction as the most important driver of
the customer's favorable behavioral intention (see, for exam-
ple, Cronin et al., 2000). Although this framework contrib-
utes significantly to understanding customers' patronage
behavior, it is clearly based solely on customer's evaluative
judgment on previous service encounters.
The TPB (Ajzen, 1991), however, recognizes that actual
behavior in many contexts may not entirely be dependent
on an individual's volitional behavioral intentions, but may
be influenced by factors that are external to one's volitional
control. Specifically, the theory suggests that customer
behavior is guided by behavioral intention as well as per-
ceived behavioral control, whereas behavioral intention is
jointly determined by customer's attitude toward the behav-
ior, subjective norm (perceived social influences on
intended behavior), and perceived behavioral control (per-
ceived ease or difficulty in carrying out intended behavior).
Clearly, to the extent customer satisfaction helps form the
attitude toward the behavior, the TPB appears consistent
with the expectation confirmation model, but it enriches
consumer behavior analysis with the inclusion of poten-
tially important social influences and perceived behavioral
control. Previous repatronage literature indeed finds that, in
influencing behavioral intention, the attitude toward the
behavior, especially formed through previous consumption
experiences (customer satisfaction) is more relevant and
predominant than the general attitude toward the behavior
(e.g., Kim, 2010; Lai & Chen, 2011).
Although the TPB identifies the role of subjective norm in
determining behavioral intention, some researchers argue
this to be the weakest component of the theory (Armitage &
Conner, 2001). In practical applications, including that in the
analysis of patronage intentions, the connection between
subjective norm and behavioral intention is often quite mixed
(Bagozzi & Dholakia, 2002; Choo, Ahn, & Petrick, 2016). In
contrast, the role of perceived behavioral control appears
overriding in influencing patronage intentions such as the
intention to pay water bills. For instance, although a water
customer has positive attitude and perceived social pressure
to pay bills on time, he or she may find it difficult to carry out
his or her intention due to lack of monitoring and control on
the part of water utility, billing irregularities, or prolonged
transaction time at payment centers. A number of previous
studies have demonstrated that patronage intentions will be
higher when an individual holds greater control over per-
forming patronage behavior (e.g., Hansen, 2008; Liao, Chen,
& Yen, 2007; Mugabi et al., 2010).
In this article, we draw on the essence of both the expec-
tation confirmation theory and the TPB and examine the
effect of Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) custom-
ers' volitional behavioral intention and nonvolitional behav-
ioral control on their bill payment behavior. In keeping with
the literature reviewed in the previous section, relevant pre-
dictor variables having a direct and/or indirect effect on pay-
ment behavior are postulated to be service quality, service
value, corporate image, utility billing, monitoring and con-
trol, transactional time, and customer satisfaction. These
variables are presumed to be associated with each other as
shown in Figure 1.
Sualihu et al. 5
As is evident in Figure 1, customer satisfaction in this
study is conceptualized as an outcome of the influences of
other predictor variables, which in turn is expected to affect
customers' behavioral intentions as reflected in their deci-
sions to pay water bills on time. However, in line with the
TPB, customers' bill payment behavior is not assumed to be
entirely under their volitional control (customer satisfaction)
but is allowed to be influenced (directly and indirectly) by
nonvolitional external institutional factors such as curtailing
the transaction time at bill payment centers and an intensive
monitoring and control mechanism and appropriate billing
system on the part of water utilities.
Research Objectives
Consistent with the conceptual framework of analysis, three
specific objectives guide our study--(a) identifying the prin-
cipal factors that influence customer satisfaction of water
services in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana (GARG), (b)
determining whether endogenously determined customer
satisfaction levels translate into an expedient actual bill pay-
ment behavior, and (c) examining whether, in addition to
their indirect influence through customer satisfaction, insti-
tutional variables such as billing issues, transaction time, and
monitoring and control have a direct effect on customers'bill
payment behavior.
Method
Data Source
A sample of 150 households is obtained from GARG out of
a population of 228,165. The operational areas of the GWCL
in the GARG are divided into three, namely, Accra East,
Accra West, and Tema regions, with customer populations of
84,698, 80,582, and 62,885, respectively. Of the three
regions, the Accra East region is randomly selected, and, the
sample for the study is then obtained from the list of custom-
ers of the Accra East region using a systematic sampling
technique, which is considered very appropriate in a house-
hold survey (Cooper & Schindler, 2003). To do this, we ran-
domly begin with a household from the list of customers and
then systematically sample every 565th (84,698/150) house-
hold from the population of customers (i.e., total list of cus-
tomers) until a sample of 150 households was obtained.
Therefore, in a sense, a two-stage sampling technique is
used. The billing systems of the customers in the region are
computerized, and that makes the sampling process quite
simple and easier to be carried out.
The Questionnaire
A self-developed survey questionnaire is used in the study.
To develop the instrument, a literature review is conducted to
determine the constructs that are necessary to be included in
the instrument. In addition to using the literature review, the
engagement of the personnel of the Customer Service
Directorate (CSD) of the GWCL helps in the design of the
instrument. In a pilot study, the questionnaire is sent out to 60
customers of the GWCL in the GARG. The data obtained
from the pilot study help in assessing the validity and reli-
ability of the instrument before it is used for the main study.
The questionnaire has a total of 46 items divided into seven
sections: The first section contains two questions for transac-
tion time (one item) and monitoring and control (one item).
For example, the questions for transaction time and monitor-
ing and control read like "How long on average does it take
you to pay your bill at payment centers?" and "How many
times on average does the staff of the GWCL visit your
premise and neighborhood?", respectively. The remaining
six sections capture data on quality of service (13 items),
customer satisfaction (10 items), corporate image (five
items), utility billing (five items), and service value (six
items) as well as background information (five items). As we
have indicated in the preceding section on variable construc-
tion, "a 5-point Likert-type scale with classifications from 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) is used to capture
data for the constructs of service quality, customer satisfac-
tion, corporate image, utility billing and service value"
(Sualihu & Rahman, 2014b, p. 483). The composite scores
are then used for the regression analysis.
The reliability of the five scales of Customer Satisfaction
(CS), Service Quality (SQ), Corporate Image (CI), Utility
Billing (UB), and Service Value (SV) is examined using the
Cronbach's coefficient alpha. The results show alpha coeffi-
cients corresponding to these constructs are .761, .811, .855,
.906, and .754, respectively. Notably, these coefficients are all
greater than .7, which is considered good and acceptable
(Sekaran, 2000). The composite scores of these constructs are
used to run the regression analyses. Construct validity of the
scales is established via exploratory factor analysis, and the
dimensions extracted using the principal components method.
Customer satisfaction is grouped into three subdimensions:
one subdimension describing satisfaction toward "billing" and
the other two describing satisfaction toward "service" and
"response." Likewise, three factors are extracted from service
quality construct: one subdimension describing quality toward
"employee behavior" and the remaining two describing qual-
ity related to "service" and "resources." The corporate image
construct yields one factor and is labeled "trust." Utility billing
generates two factors and they are labeled as "monetary" and
"billing." The service value construct yields two factors,
which are labeled as "trust" and "service."
Data Collection Procedure
The data are collected using a survey questionnaire. Of the
150 questionnaires sent out, we got 122 of them back. We
adopted approaches such as sending regular reminders to the
survey participants and providing appropriate assistance to
6 SAGE Open
those respondents who had difficulty in reading and/or
understanding the items on the questionnaire. That resulted
in the relatively higher response rate (81.33%). Our compu-
tation of the dependent variable (mean bill payment period
[MBPP]), which reflects the bill payment behavior, is based
on customers' billing and payment history sourced directly
from the GWCL.
With respect to the respondents' background data, out of
the 122 respondents who answer and return their question-
naires, 44.26% are males whereas 55.74% are females.
Another 65.48% of the respondents claim they are educated,
whereas 34.52% claim they are uneducated.1 Also, 27.05%
of the respondents report they are aged between 18 and 35
years (young adults), whereas 55.74% and 17.21% report
they are aged between 36 and 60 years (adults) and above 60
years (elderly), respectively; 24.60% of the respondents have
an annual income of less than GH¢ 1,000 and 20.50% have
an annual income level of more than GH¢ 5,000.
Ethical Consideration
All social science research involves ethical issues. This is
because research involves collecting data from people and
about people, and their rights and concerns in the research
process must be respected at all times (Sekaran, 2000). Ethical
considerations of confidentiality and voluntary and informed
consent are consciously upheld throughout the research. For
instance, on the issue of the voluntary and informed consent,
letters are given out to the respondents informing them about
the rationale for the research, the roles they are expected to
play and how the information they provide is going to be
used. Questionnaires are then distributed to only those who
agree to participate in the research. Besides, for the sake of
confidentiality, instead of using house numbers to identify
respondents, special codes are given to them to make them
anonymous. Finally, the research is not sponsored by any
funds from the GWCL or its affiliates.
Empirical Specification
In line with the conceptual framework (Figure 1), we esti-
mate the following empirical model so as to appreciate the
nature and extent of the influence of each of the previously
defined constructs on customer satisfaction and how the lat-
ter is reflected in their bill payment behavior.

tomer in the sample, respectively. 
k
and k are the k th
regression parameters of interest, and ui
and vi are the error
terms for Equations 1 and 2, respectively (see Table 1 for
variable construction).
Because CSi
is the dependent variable in Equation 1 and
a predictor in Equation 2, clearly there exists a system of
equations. The problem with such a system of equations is
that the estimation of each equation separately will produce
biased and inconsistent estimates of coefficients if the error
terms across Equations 1 and 2 are correlated. As typical of
many research settings, we consider this possibility to be real
in our case as well. Technically, any construct irrespective of
whether it is identifiable and/or measurable or not, that sys-
tematically affects both CSi and MBPPi and is missing
from the set of variables explicitly considered in the model
will induce correlation between the error terms in Equations
1 and 2. Moreover, the measurement errors associated with
CSi
and MBPPi may also be another source of correlation
between error terms across equations. Therefore, to obtain
consistent estimates, we apply an instrumental variable esti-
mation technique underlying the two-stage least squares
method in this study. In implementing the two-stage least
squares method for our purpose, we follow a three-step pro-
cedure suggested by Shaver (2005)--(a) least squares are
used to estimate Equation 1, (b) predicted values of CSi
from Equation 1 replace CSi
in Equation 2, and (c) least
squares are then used to estimate coefficients of Equation 2.
Empirical Results
We begin by reporting the results of some preliminary analy-
ses of the survey instrument and data. Specifically, before
estimating the empirical specification of our interest, we pro-
vide some relevant descriptive and diagnostic statistics on
the constructs we use in our regression model.
Descriptive Statistics
The descriptive statistics of the data in Table 2 provide infor-
mation about the sample characteristics as captured by mean,
standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, and coef-
ficient of variation (CV) of the variables. The dependent vari-
able in our regression model, MBPP, has a mean value of
approximately 208 days. The MBPP shows a minimum value
of approximately 20 days and a maximum value of 365 days.
Clearly, there is a wide variation of MBPP across customers.
This is supported by a relatively high value of CV of about
49%. Except for TT and MC, all variables show only a reason-
able amount of variation relative to their respective mean val-
ues. The high values of CV for TT (60.91%) and MC (68.11%)
are an indication of very diverse customer experiences in
terms of waiting times at different bill payment points and
monitoring and control activities on the part of the GWCL.
Sualihu et al. 7
Correlations depicting the magnitude and direction and
linear pairwise relationship between the variables under
consideration are provided in Table 3. Consistent with our
conceptual framework, the mediating variable (CS) has
the expected signs with each of the six predictor variables
and, except for MC, they are all significant at 5% level or
better. Similarly, we note that CS and TT correlate with
the dependent variable (MBPP) with expected sign and
the correlation coefficients are at 5% level. Although MC
is found to have an expected negative correlation with
MBPP, the relationship is not significant. The correlation
matrix of Table 3 also helps to examine the issues of mul-
ticollinearity between the predictor variables. If the vari-
ables are highly correlated with the correlation coefficient
being close to 1, then it becomes extremely hard to evalu-
ate the true effects of the predictor variables. Accordingly,
we assess the issue of multicollinearity in Table 4, and
find that, although there is no notable evidence of high
correlation between MC and TT or with other predictors,
there are some traces of rather high and significant corre-
lation coefficients among the other predictor variables.
For instance, SV shows a positive correlation of .723 and
.740 with SQ and CI, respectively.
Based on the high correlations between some of the
variables, for example, SV with SQ and CI, we decide to
investigate the issue further using the variance inflation
factor (VIF), and its inverse referred to as the tolerance, for
each of the predictor variables (see Table 4). Large VIF
values show a high degree of collinearity or multicol-
linearity among the predictor variables used in a regres-
sion analysis (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2014).
Notably, our collinearity diagnostics do not show high VIF
(or tolerance), as the values for the predictor variables are
all below 10 (or 0.10).

This is proxied by MBPP. The metric is calculated by dividing total bills outstanding by
total bills received across two financial years, that is, from January 2010 to December
2011, the resulting figure is then multiplied by 365 days. Finally, we average the yearly
payment periods of each customer for 2010 and 2011 to arrive at the final measure of
MBPP to be used in the study (Sualihu & Rahman, 2014b).

Main Results
We present the findings of estimating the system of equations
comprising regression Equations 1 and 2 in Tables 5 and 6,
respectively. Reported results in Table 5 show that, although
all the predictor variables have an expected sign of the asso-
ciation with CS, only MC, SQ, and CI have a statistically sig-
nificant influence on CS at 1% level or better. Controlling for
the effects of the other variables, the coefficient value on MC
implies that an additional monitoring and control measure
(measured by average number of inspections) reduces the sat-
isfaction level of a typical water customer by 0.338 units.
Likewise, significant SQ and CI coefficients imply that the
CS of a customer increases by 0.258 and 1.029 units for each
unit of increase in the service quality and corporate image
indices, respectively. Absolute values of reported standard-
ized coefficients show that one standard deviation change in
CI results in the highest effect on CS followed by SQ and
MC, respectively. Finally, the results in Table 5 suggest that
the predictor variables collectively explain much of the vari-
ance in the CS (adjusted R2 = 73.0%), the significance of
which is established by the overall test of the goodness of
model fit (F = 93.500, p < .001).
Estimation results of regression Equation 2 are summa-
rized in Table 6. Consistent with the predictions underlying
our conceptual framework, we find that all the variables
except UB (TT, MC, and CS) statistically significantly (at
the 5% alpha level or better) affect customers' MBPP in
expected directions. More specifically, the coefficient value
on TT suggests that, controlling for the effects of the other
predictors, a water customer's MBPP increases by more than
one third of a day (0.334) for an increase in transaction time
by 1 min. Likewise, the coefficient value on MC implies that,
ceteris paribus, each additional inspection of customers'
facilities has the potential to decrease MBPP by approxi-
mately 10 days (10.036). In addition, the MBPP of a water
customer drops by approximately 9 days (9.112) when the
customer satisfaction index increases by one unit. The abso-
lute values of standardized coefficients suggest that one stan-
dard deviation change in CS results in the highest effect on
MBPP, followed by that in MC and TT, respectively. The
adjusted R2 value (70.63%) coupled with a significant over-
all F-test statistic (F = 139.630 at p < .001) suggests that the
variables considered together explain much of the variations
in MBPP of the GWCL customers. Finally, given our con-
ceptual framework, two institutional variables TT and MC
are presumed to have both direct and indirect effects on
MBPP. In contrast, however, our empirical results in Tables
5 and 6 suggest that, whereas MC has both a direct effect and
an indirect effect mediated through CS, the entire effect of
TT on MBPP is of direct nature.
Discussion of Results
The results presented in Tables 5 and 6 show that MC, CI, and
SQ are the major determinants of CS toward the water utility,
which in turn, together with TT and MC, explains a signifi-
cant part of the total variation in water customers' bill pay-
ment behavior. The variables, in order of their direct impact
on customers' MBPP, are CS, MC, and TT, respectively.
The results indicate that, although TT does not have an
influence on CS, it has significant effect on MBPP. Therefore,
the entire effect of TT on MBPP is direct and no part of the
effect works indirectly through its influence on CS. This
finding implies that even though customers may not form a
favorable attitude toward the utility company, a reduction in
TT has the potential to induce customers to pay their bills
early. Unlike TT, however, we find MC variable to have both
a direct and an indirect (through CS) effect on MBPP.
Interestingly, these two effects work in opposite direction.As
part of its direct effect, increased MC activity by the water
utility helps curtail MBPP to a significant extent. However,
given an observed negative relationship between CS and
MBPP, as part of its indirect effect through CS, increased
MC tends also to prolong MBPP.2 A positive indirect effect
of MC on MBPP is not entirely surprising. Quite typical of

experiences in other developing countries, many water cus-
tomers in Ghana may not like their facilities to be inspected
regularly for fear of being found out to be guilty of illegal
connections, meter defilement, and bill accumulation. These
customers are, therefore, not comfortable with frequent mon-
itoring and control by GWCL.

value has a positive effect on overall customer satisfaction.
Our finding that SV not having an influence on CS may be
due to a possibility that the construct SQ capturing the effect
of SV in explaining CS. Consistent with Zeithaml's (1988)
model, several studies have shown that SQ leads to SV in a
service encounter. Because a customer assesses SV by trad-
ing off the quality of service versus its cost in a given situa-
tion, the customer's assessment of SV may largely be driven
by SQ for as long as the prices for the service do not freely
fluctuate. Like that of many other continuously provided ser-
vice utilities, GWCL's price changes are largely infrequent
and no such changes occurred at the time of our survey.
Another possible reason of the insignificance of SV in
explaining CS and MBPP could be related to the general
belief and attitude of many customers that the flow of water
ought to be free of cost. Given the long history of either free
or at least heavily subsidized water services across most low-
income countries (see Kayaga et al., 2004), such attitudinal
problem and consequent misplaced evaluations of value of
water services on the part of customers may have distorted
the relationship between SV and CS in our analysis.
The results of the study show a significant positive rela-
tionship between corporate image and customer satisfaction,
which is consistent with our conceptual framework and some
of the recent findings such as that of Richard and Zhang
(2012) and Srivastava and Sharma (2013). However, con-
trary to the prediction of our conceptual framework of analy-
sis, we do not find significant effect of UB in determining
customers' satisfaction level. One possible explanation for
billing issues not having an impact on CS could be that the
water customers of the GWCL have other more pressing con-
cerns such as those related to infrequent water supply and
delays in fixing frequently leaking water pipes, which weigh
more in determining the overall customer satisfaction level.
Summary, Conclusions, and
Recommendations
In recent years, GWCL has been going through a series of
transformational reforms so as to break away from the depen-
dence on government subsidy and to achieve financial inde-
pendence. However, similar to other water utilities operating,
especially in the low-income countries, the company is find-
ing it increasingly difficult to keep its customers current with
their water bills. Faced with poor cost recovery because of
untimely bill payment from the customers, it has become
very much of a burden on the company to continue to pro-
vide adequate service and meet an acceptable headline effi-
ciency target (Hassanein & Khalifa, 2006). With this
background, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect
of a set of behavioral and institutional factors on the bill pay-
ment behavior based on a cross-sectional survey of water
customers in the GARG.
Customer satisfaction is found to be the most significant
direct predictor of the variation in the time taken to settle the
Our study shows a significant positive relationship
between SQ and CS. Consistent with the findings of many
others (e.g., Babakus & Boller, 1992; Cronin & Taylor,
1992), this result suggests that service quality may indeed
play a key role in creating a satisfied and loyal customer base
for water services in Ghana. In contrast, however, our results
with respect to SV seem to contradict what appears to be a
consensus in the services literature that perceived service

water bills followed by monitoring and control measures and
transaction time at the bill payment centers, respectively.
Although an increase in customer satisfaction and monitor-
ing and control activities induce customers to settle their
water bills early, increased transaction time at bill payment
centers leads to delayed payments. The conceptual model of
the study also considers how the effects of a set of judgmen-
tal (service quality, service value, and corporate image) and
institutional (utility billing, monitoring and control, and
transaction time) variables on customers' payment behavior
are mediated through customer satisfaction. The results indi-
cate that an increase in perceived service quality and corpo-
rate image relate positively to the level of customer
satisfaction and help curtail the payment period. In contrast,
however, increased monitoring and control activities are
found to reduce customer satisfaction, which in turn exert an
indirect negative influence on customers' payment behavior.
Our results do not support any indirect role of service value,
utility billing, and transaction time in customers' decision to
pay water bills in time.
From both theoretical and managerial standpoints, these
findings may have several implications. From a theoretical
perspective, this study makes an important contribution to
the limited literature on the factors influencing customer
decision when it comes to paying water bills in time.
Although the importance of some customer-centric judg-
mental factors such as service quality and customer satisfac-
tion has previously been studied in models of customers'
decision to pay in time (namely, Kayaga et al., 2004; Mugabi
et al., 2007b), we are not aware of any study that explicitly
considers whether certain institutional factors, independently
or in combination with typical judgmental factors, have a
role to play in customers' decision process. In addition to
customer satisfaction, the inclusion of factors such as billing
issues, monitoring and control, and transaction time in this
study not only highlights the importance of these institu-
tional factors but also provides a more comprehensive under-
standing of their effect on both customer satisfaction and
behavioral intention as reflected in customer decision to pay
water bills in time.
Form managerial perspective, one of the key lessons that
can be drawn from this analysis is that cost recovery of water
utilities through customers' timely payment may be influ-
enced by a multitude of factors. An understanding of these
diverse factors affecting the payment behavior is extremely
useful, especially in the context of capital-constrained water
utilities operating in developing countries. The study con-
firms that customer satisfaction is of paramount importance
in inducing customers to pay their water utility bills on a
timely basis. Given our results, it seems that any particular
cost recovery or bill collection strategy is unlikely to succeed
if certain aspects relating to the service and the organization
itself (e.g., service quality and corporate image) are not prop-
erly taken care of. Our results support the view that service
quality is important in creating a satisfied and loyal customer
base (Ostrowski et al., 1993). Because perceived service
quality originates from customers' expectations, it is neces-
sary to identify customers' expectations of service quality
and incorporate these expectations into water service deliv-
ery process. In addition, we find that the customers not only
need to feel satisfied because of a high perceived quality,
which fulfills or exceeds their expectations, but also need to
perceive some form of positive emotional attachment with
the water utility. Therefore, emphasis should also be placed
on improving image of the utility in the minds of the custom-
ers. Corporate image can support or undermine the value that
customers believe they are getting (Abdullah, Al-Nasser, &
Husain, 2000), and it is created and developed in customers'
mind through proper communication and experience of ser-
vice delivery encounters (Srivastava & Sharma, 2013).
In addition, our analysis suggests that, rather than merely
concentrating on customer satisfaction improvement, strate-
gies also need to be adopted at the operational level (e.g.,
improving monitoring and control mechanism and curtailing
transaction time). In describing management-related chal-
lenges facing water utilities in developing countries, Mugabi,
Kayaga, and Njiru (2007a) correctly note that many of those
utilities lack effective management information system to
allow adequate monitoring and evaluation to achieve opera-
tional improvements.
Interestingly, we find that greater monitoring and control
activities tend to reduce customer satisfaction level, and
thereby have an adverse indirect effect on the time taken to
settle water bills. This finding underscores the need for orga-
nizing various customer awareness­raising programs on a
regular basis so as to help customers understand that water is
just another scarce economic resource, and the water service
delivery system is an essential but a very cost-intensive pro-
cess. Such customer sensitization initiatives would not only
ensure dissemination of more information on the process of
water and sanitation provision but also help to resolve cus-
tomers' misunderstandings in appreciating the true value of
water services. We also find that there is a wide variation in
the number of days that customers take to pay their bills.
Although some customers pay their bills within 20 days after
presentment, it takes others about a year to pay their bills.
This is not a good sign, as the water utility relies on these
payments for its operational activities and investments.
Notwithstanding the findings of our study and their associ-
ated practical implications, the study has its own limitations.
To ascertain the theoretical aspects of the proposed model of
bill payment behavior, we have purposefully limited the num-
ber of antecedents to seven variables. However, we acknowl-
edge that there may be additional variables that are potentially
useful for a better understanding of customers' attitude and
their actual payment behavior, which should also be explored
in future studies. In this regard, Mugabi and Kayaga (2010),
for example, stress the importance of sociodemographic char-
acteristics of the customer clientele. Another potential limita-
tion of the study relates to the ability of cross-sectional data in
Sualihu et al. 11
establishing causal relationship, which is often questioned in
the literature (see, for example, Katz, 2001; Hong & Goo,
2004). Although we have adopted a two-stage least squares
approach to establish the causal ordering of the variables
based on background knowledge from the existing literature,
the adequacy of the proposed model depends critically on the
stability (coherence) of results across time and space
(Rindfleisch, Malter, Ganesan, & Moorman, 2008; Wunsch,
Russo, & Mouchart, 2010). Future replication of the study is,
therefore, important for testing whether and to what extent
these results extend to the context of water utilities in other
countries with similar socioeconomic characteristics. By
doing so, the structural equation modeling, although seriously
criticized by Shaver (2005), could also be used. To achieve an
explicit time ordering of the cause-and-effect relationship, the
use of longitudinal data in future studies would be another
interesting development.

as follows: standardized coefficient of MC in Equation 2 +
(standardized coefficient of MC in Equation 1 × standardized
coefficient of CS in Equation 2), where CS is customer satis-
faction. Substituting coefficient values from Tables 5 and 6,
the net effect of MC on MBPP is found to be -0.225.
