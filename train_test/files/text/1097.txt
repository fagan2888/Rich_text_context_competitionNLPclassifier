ABSTRACT
Aims To help refine the definition and diagnosis of gambling disorders, we
investigated the distribution among US gamblers of the 10 DSM-IV criteria for
Pathological Gambling.
Design We drew data from two stratified random surveys (n = 2417, n = 530)
of gambling behavior and consequences among community-based samples of
US adults. A fully structured questionnaire, administered by trained lay inter-
viewers, screened for the life-time prevalence of problem and Pathological Gam-
bling. Per DSM-IV definitions, anyone meeting five or more of 10 itemized
criteria was considered a pathological gambler. We analyzed these criteria
among all gamblers who met one or more criteria (n = 399).
Findings Most gamblers who met only one or two criteria reported `chasing
their losses'. At subclinical levels (three to four criteria), gamblers also reported
elevated rates of gambling-related fantasy: lying, gambling to escape and pre-
occupation. Pathological gamblers with five to seven criteria reported marked
elevations of loss of control, withdrawal symptoms and tolerance (internalizing
dimensions of dependence); risking their social relationships and needing to be
bailed out financially (externalizing dimensions). Most of the highest-level
pathological gamblers (eight to 10 criteria) reported committing illegal acts to
support gambling.
Conclusion Dependence in a biobehavioral sense appears to be a hallmark of
Pathological Gambling, but it marks only one threshold in a qualitative hierar-
chy of disorders beginning with a common subclinical behavior, `chasing'. Epi-
demiological assessments and future DSM revisions might consider explicit
recognition of a problem gambling disorder, identifying people presenting
some cognitive symptoms of Pathological Gambling but not clear signs of
dependence. Pathological gamblers in turn appear to have two distinct levels of
severity.
KEYWORDS Diagnosis, impulse control disorders, pathological gambling,
substance-related disorders.
INTRODUCTION
The rapid spread of legal gambling opportunities in the
United States and internationally has intensified the need
to refine our understanding of Pathological Gambling, a
disorder recognized widely as present in 1­2% of the
adult population [American Psychiatric Association
1994 (APA); Gerstein et al. 1999; National Gambling
Impact Study Commission 1999 (NGISC); National
Research Council 1999 (NRC); Shaffer, Hall & Vander Bilt
1997, 1999; Volberg 2001; Welte et al. 2001]. Patholog-
ical Gambling was included as an official diagnosis in the
third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM-III) (APA 1980); each subse-
quent revision (APA 1994, 1987) has modified the diag-
nostic criteria based on research advances. The current
DSM requires that an individual meet five or more of 10
defining criteria for a diagnosis of `Pathological Gam-
bling'. According to the manual's text, the essential
feature of this disorder is `persistent and recurrent
© 2003 Society for the Study of Addiction to Alcohol and Other Drugs Addiction, 98, 1661­1672
1662 Marianna Toce-Gerstein et al.
maladaptive gambling behavior...that disrupts personal,
family, or vocational pursuits' (APA 1994, p. 615).
Although there is general debate concerning the diag-
nostic approach taken by the DSM (Clark, Watson & Rey-
nolds 1995; Follette & Houts 1996; Nathan &
Langenbucher 1999; Widiger & Clark 2000), there is
widespread acceptance of the DSM-IV gambling defini-
tions and criteria by researchers and clinicians in many
countries where legalized gambling exists [e.g. England
(Fisher 2000; Sproston, Erens & Orford 2000), Sweden
(Volberg et al. 2001), New Zealand (Abbott & Volberg
2000) and the United States (National Research Council
1999; Slutske et al. 2000)]. Nonetheless, a longstanding
debate continues as to whether gambling disorders com-
prise a single, sharply distinguished pathological entity or
lie on a continuum, with no symptoms and florid Patho-
logical Gambling as its respective endpoints (Blaszczynski
& McConaghy 1989; Shaffer & Hall 1996; National
Research Council 1999; Slutske et al. 2000; Blaszczynski
2002). Some researchers have suggested that these dif-
fering measurement models may serve different purposes
and are conceptually compatible with each other (Clark,
Livesley & Morel 1997; Kessler 2002). This point of view
suggests a third possibility, which is that gambling prob-
lems comprise a hierarchy of logically related but quali-
tatively different disorders--an extension within a single
diagnostic entity of an idea currently applied by some
authors to broader classes of disorders (Watson 1999;
Widiger & Clark 2000).
Investigations of gambling behavior and symptoms
may shed useful light on these three positions. This paper
describes the results of one such investigation: an analysis
of how the individual criteria designated by DSM-IV dis-
tribute across two randomly drawn samples of adults in
the United States, from individuals reporting a single cri-
terion to those presenting the full suite of 10. We exam-
ined these distributions using a simple taxonomy of
gamblers, exploring the association of individual criteria
relative to their distribution.
METHODS
Participants
This analysis used data from selected participants in two
probability surveys conducted in 1998­99 as part of the
US Gambling Impact and Behavior Study (GIBS) (Ger-
stein et al. 1999). These surveys were, respectively, a tele-
phone survey of household residents and an in-person
survey of gambling facility patrons (restricted to US resi-
dents). The telephone survey was based on a national
random sample of US residential telephone numbers.This
survey was designed to represent proportionately all
adult household residents at every level of gambling
behavior (including non-gamblers). Structured 30-
minute interviews were completed with a total of 2417
adults, including 44 interviews using a Spanish transla-
tion of the questionnaire. Households were called and
screened initially to roster the current residents 18 years
and older and then randomly select one adult per house-
hold.The screening completion rate was 75.3% of house-
holds, and the interview rate among eligible respondents
was 73.7%, for a composite yield of 55.5%.
The patron survey was designed specifically to capture
large numbers of frequent and particularly problem and
pathological gamblers efficiently, relative to their preva-
lence in the household population. It sampled gamblers
randomly but proportionally to their frequency of enter-
ing commercial gambling venues, and thus did not sam-
ple current non-gamblers (who comprised less than 1%
of thefacilitypatronsversus32%of householdresidents).
Twenty-minute interviews (a subset of questions from
the telephone survey instrument) were completed by 530
adults from a stratified sample of 21 gaming facilities in
eight states, including resort-style casinos in Nevada and
New Jersey; `riverboat' casinos in the Midwest and South;
tribal casinos in the North and West; racetracks in East-
ern, Midwestern and Western states; and lottery ticket
outlets in the West and Midwest, stratified by neighbor-
hood income level.The distribution of the total interviews
was proportional to the annual gaming receipts of these
facility types, which comprised the most frequently vis-
ited gambling venues, according to the telephone survey
results and other sources (e.g. Christensen Cummings
Associates 1993­97).
Interview teams at each facility followed rigorous
sampling rules to select and recruit (`intercept') respon-
dents at random entries/exits or main internal traffic cor-
ridors during staggered daytime and evening shifts. The
interview completion rate across all venues was 50.0%, a
rate comparable to random telephone surveys and much
higher than usually achieved in intercept surveys. All the
field procedures and related methodological details of the
surveys were reviewed extensively by independent
research experts and reported in detail in the GIBS report
(Gerstein et al. 1999). The report, instruments and
datasets from the study are freely available via the inter-
net (see Acknowledgements for websites).
A subgroup of each sample was administered a DSM-
IV-based diagnostic instrument for Pathological Gam-
bling. These were respondents who reported ever having
more than $100 in gambling losses in a single day or
across a single year of their lives. We chose to use these
`filter' questions in the national survey after pretesting
indicated that non-gamblers and very infrequent gam-
blers grew impatient with repeated questions about gam-
bling-related problems. Moreover, a review of prior
Gambling disorders 1663

surveys conducted by the authors indicated that people
who had never experienced significant losses were
unlikely to report problems related to gambling. The
resulting 399 adults (234 from the telephone sample and
165 from the patron sample) who met these qualifica-
tions and reported one or more life-time DSM-IV symp-
toms of Pathological Gambling are the focus of the
analyses reported here.
We tested for statistically significant differences
between the telephone and patron respondents using c2
for all variables except the continuous variables of age,
problem status (NODS score) and distance to large gam-
bling facility, which were tested using the Student's t-test.
(although patrons were more likely to live closer to a large
gaming facility and have a higher NODS score, Pearson's
r indicates that NODS score and distance were not signif-
icantly correlated in the sample.) The telephone and
patron groups who reported one or more DSM-IV criteria
did not differ significantly from each other in gender, edu-
cation, income or employment status. However, the
patron sample was significantly older than the house-
hold-based sample, with mean and median age in the
early 50s rather than early 40s, and commensurately
greater likelihood of being divorced rather than never-
married. The patron sample also had significantly more
African Americans and fewer Hispanics (and other eth-
nic minorities) than the household survey; the household
group was similar to the general population in these
respects. As the patron sample drew from a relatively
small number of primary sampling units, this could
reflect geographic bias in the selection of facilities and/or
real differences in the ethnic composition of patrons.
Finally, the patrons differed in their gambling-related
characteristics. They were three times as likely (59% ver-
sus 22%) to live within 50 miles of a large gambling
venue (500 or more electronic gaming devices), twice as
likely to gamble at least once a month (not including lot-
tery play, which was also more frequent among patrons)
and much more likely (23% versus 9%) to be pathological
gamblers, reflecting the successful achievement of the
specific objective of the patron survey.
Questionnaire
The structured interview schedules employed in both the
telephone and patron-intercept surveys included a new
diagnostic module for Pathological Gambling based on
the DSM-IV criteria. The specific items that make up the
NORC Diagnostic Screen (NODS) for gambling problems,
with their corresponding DSM-IV criteria, are displayed
in Table 1 (item labels are capitalized hereinafter to dis-
tinguish them from the same words used generically).
Prior to the deployment of the NODS in the main stud-
ies, the module was pilot-tested for reliability and validity
in a random telephone sample of 45 respondents in the
Chicago metropolitan area and a convenience sample of
40 people recently enrolled in gambling treatment pro-
grams in several other states. Ninety-five per cent of the
clinical sample scored five or more points on the life-time
NODS; the remaining two cases scored four points. These
results are very similar to those reported by Stinchfield
(2003) using a comparable DSM-IV-based instrument.
The test­retest reliability of the NODS was examined in a
half-sample of 44 cases drawn equally from the clinical
and telephone pilot samples. The life-time and past-year
scores were found to be highly reliable (r = 0.99 and 0.98,
respectively) (Gerstein et al. 1999).
Taxonomy
The DSM-IV specifies that meeting five or more criteria
establishes a diagnosis of Pathological Gambling, thus
dividing the symptomatic population into those reporting
one to four criteria and those reporting five to 10.To facil-
itate the statistical investigation we bisected each of these
ranges, classifying subclinical gamblers into one to two
and three to four criteria, and pathological gamblers into
five to seven and eight to 10 criteria.
While the DSM-IV has no formal nomenclature for
people below the level of five criteria, researchers in the
field have constructed a variety of descriptors for individ-
uals who fall into the upper subclinical range. For exam-
ple, in Shaffer and Hall's (1996) typology, pathological
gamblers are referred to as `level-3 disordered gamblers',
while the remainder of people experiencing any problems
related to their gambling are `level-2 disordered gam-
blers'. Shaffer et al. (1997) call for additional research
investigating whether differences exist within this classi-
fication. For our analysis, we labeled gamblers meeting
three or four criteria `problem gamblers', consistent with
much of the existing literature (Lesieur & Blume 1987;
Shaffer et al. 1997; Abbott & Volberg 1999), including
the original report on these data (Gerstein et al. 1999).
Also consistent with that report, we labeled people meet-
ing one or two criteria `at-risk' gamblers.
Statistical methods
We examined relationships between the distributions of
the 10 criteria across the 399 people who reported at
least one NODS criterion using three methods. First, we
ran a principal components analysis (PCA) and a comple-
mentary multi-level regression analysis. The PCA yielded
a primary component with an eigenvalue of 3.2; all other
components had an eigenvalue of 1.1 or less. The pri-
mary component had moderate to strong factor loadings
of at least 0.47 for all variables with the exception of
Chasing, which comprised its own factor, with a loading
© 2003 Society for the Study of Addiction to Alcohol and Other Drugs Addiction, 98, 1661­1672
1664 Marianna Toce-Gerstein et al.
of 0.89. The PCA therefore indicates that with the excep-
tion of the Chasing item, the NODS measures a single
underlying construct. (Unfortunately, the sample size did
not support conducting a separate analysis for each level
of the taxonomy.)
As an alternative to the PCA, we also estimated a
multi-level regression model to predict total score from
the 10 individual scores, in order to determine whether
there were none, one, or more than one latent dimen-
sions in the covariance matrix of the criteria. In similar
fashion to the PCA, the results pointed clearly to one
main component, with which all but two of the criteria--
Chasing and Illegal Acts--had significant positive linear
coefficients and no positive nonlinear (quadratic) coeffi-
cients. As part of this process, we computed pairwise
associations for all 10 criteria using Cramer's V statistic
(f).
Secondly, guided by this provisional outcome, we
plotted for each separate criterion the proportion of
people reporting the criterion against the full range of
Table 1 DSM-IV criteria and matched NODS life-time questions

non-zero NODS scores, and fitted a series of univariate
curves to the observed plots. In other words, we
regressed separately the likelihood of a positive report
on each item against the overall score for all items. The
curves fitted were linear and non-linear (logarithmic
and polynomial). Well-fitting linear curves supported a
simple dimensional interpretation of gambling prob-
lems: the criterion's observed incidence at different lev-
els of total score was close to the rate one would expect
if the probability of the symptom's appearance were
directly dependent on increasing severity in a uniform
underlying process. A decelerating curvilinear line
(concave upwards) means that when few if any other
items are present, the likelihood of the symptom is
higher than would be expected on a linear basis, sug-
gesting a `low-threshold' relationship with the latent
dimension. An accelerating curve (concave up-wards)
means that in the absence of many other items, the
symptom appears even less often than would be
expected, suggesting a `high-threshold' relationship
with an underlying process. We tested the goodness of
each curve's fit by calculating the R2 and associated sig-
nificance level.
Thirdly, we grouped individuals by NODS score as dis-
cussed above (one to two, three to four, five to seven, eight
to 10) and compared pairwise the relative proportions
affirming each individual item between adjacent groups.
We also tested for differences between adjacent levels
using cut-points other than those reported here, and
found that the initial subdivisions provided the most con-
sistent and coherent set of results. We evaluated the sta-
tistical significance of each comparison using Fisher's
exact test. Unless otherwise indicated, all such results
reported here are significant at the P < 0.01 level.
The observation of whether a particular item was
reported and the total number reported for each respon-
dent are not completely independent, so the indepen-
dence-of-measures assumptions of the statistical
significance test were not met fully. However, when we
modified the analysis to compare the likelihood of report-
ing any given item with the total NODS score from all
items except the one tested, the results were virtually
identical. We therefore present only the more inclusive
results.
In previous reports, when using these datasets to
estimate overall US population prevalence and corre-
lates of problem and Pathological Gambling, the survey
samples were merged and weighted using a dual-frame
method, as discussed in Skinner & Rao (1996) and
Biemer (1984). The present paper's objectives are
served better by a simple unweighted aggregation of the
two pertinent subsets of respondents. Among other
advantages, this permits the inclusion of 20 cases omit-
ted from the merged overall data file to limit the vari-
ance in sample weights. However, all the analyses
reported here were also calculated using the merged
data file and published sample weights. The weighted
results (which may be obtained from the authors) were
nearly identical with those reported here.

At-risk gambling
At-risk gamblers comprised 69.7% of the gamblers who
reported one or more criteria. Within this group, when
comparing those with scores of 1 and 2 on the NODS, we
found statistically significant increases (P < 0.01) to
beyond the expected level of prevalence (20.0%) for Chas-
ing and Escape. Most at-risk gamblers endorsed one
among a small subset of the criteria, the most common of
which by far was Chasing, followed by Preoccupation and
Escape (see Table 2).
Described in detail by Henry Lesieur (1977) in his
classic book The Chase, this behavior occurs when gam-
blers attempt to recover their losses by continuing to
gamble, typically incurring additional rather than
reduced debt. Of all gamblers who met one or more DSM-
IV criteria, 59.6% reported this criterion. In fact, 46.0%
of the gamblers scoring 1 on the NODS reported Chasing
(the expected number would be 10.0%). As shown in
Table 3, Chasing had a significant association only
with Preoccupation, which was both weak and negative
(f = -0.11).
Figure 1a illustrates the proportion of gamblers
reporting this criterion by NODS score; it is notable that
there is not much increase above a NODS score of 2,
except at the very upper tail where all criteria are con-
strained to be present. Of all the DSM-IV criteria, Chasing
obtained the least satisfactory fit in the regression analy-
sis. A decelerating cubic regression curve was the best fit
among the equations tried, indicating a low-threshold
symptom.
Problem gambling
We defined `problem gamblers' as people who met three
or four of the life-time diagnostic criteria for Pathological
Gambling. They comprised 14.7% of those who reported
one or more criteria. The proportion of gamblers report-
ing each criterion increased significantly between the two
levels of at-risk and problem gambling (see Table 2) with
one exception, Illegal Acts. After Chasing, three crite-
ria--Preoccupation, Escape and Lying--were most com-
monly reported by problem gamblers (and by gamblers
overall). Individually, two-thirds (65.5%) of problem
gamblers reported Preoccupation, and about half
reported Escape (51.7%) and Lying (44.8%). In contrast,
no more than 22.4% of problem gamblers reported any of
the remaining criteria (except for the previously dis-
cussed Chasing, which was reported by 76% of problem
gamblers). As shown in Fig. 1b­d, decelerating polyno-
mial curves best fit the distribution for Preoccupation,
Escape and Lying, indicating that all three tend to be low-
threshold phenomena, but distribute quite differently
from Chasing.
Association measures confirm an underlying relation-
ship among these criteria: Escape was most strongly asso-
ciated with Lying (f = 0.30); Lying was associated most
strongly with Risked Relationships (f = 0.42) and Escape
(f = 0.30); and Preoccupation was most strongly associ-
ated with Lying (f = 0.27) (see Table 3).
Also of note is that only Preoccupation increased sig-
nificantly between scores of 2 and 3; in fact, the percent-
age of respondents reporting this criterion more than
doubled between these scores, from 26.2% to 57.6%
(P < 0.01). Lying also more than doubled between scores
of 2 and 3, from 16.9% to 36.4% (P = 0.03), although
this result fell short of our cut point for significance. The
simple linear progression for each criterion would be
from 20% to 30%.
Low-severity Pathological Gambling
By definition, pathological gamblers present five or more
DSM-IV diagnostic criteria over the course of their lives
(APA 1994). We examined whether any of the 10 DSM-
IV criteria were better at distinguishing pathological
gamblers who scored 5­7 on the NODS from problem
gamblers scoring 3­4 (see Table 2). The most significant
differences were for Withdrawal and Loss of Control, with
more weakly significant differences for Escape and Lying

(discussed above), Tolerance, Bailout and Risked Rela-
tionships. When we restricted our tests to respondents
scoring 4 versus 5, only Withdrawal and Loss of Control
remained significant (P = 0.01). Measures of association
revealed that Withdrawal and Loss of Control were more
strongly associated with each other than any other crite-
ria (f = 0.44). Also of note was that Tolerance was most
strongly associated with Withdrawal (f = 0.27) and Loss
of Control (f = 0.25) (see Table 3).
As shown in Table 2, the frequency of respondents
reporting Bailout increased significantly between each
level of the taxonomy except between the less severe and
more severe pathological gamblers; however, that differ-
ence was just shy of our significance gate (P = 0.016).
Although conceptually Bailout would seem to be related
most closely to Tolerance (needing loans to pay off debts
would seem to follow from needing to bet larger and
larger amounts of money), Bailout was actually most
strongly associated with Risked Relationships (f = 0.41),
and secondarily with Illegal Acts and Lying (f = 0.30)
(see Table 3).
The DSM-IV criterion of Risked Relationships
conceives personal and professional damage as a failure
to fulfill social obligations (see Table 1). Risked Relation-
ships was highly interdependent with other criteria; the
strongest relationships were with Lying (f = 0.42),
Bailout (f = 0.41) and Illegal Acts and Withdrawal
(f = 0.35).
Fig. 1e­i displays the distribution of, and regression
curves for these five criteria. The best fit for each criterion
was linear, indicating that each of these items is at `mid-
threshold' synchrony with the latent dimension or
process.
High-severity Pathological Gambling
Finally, we investigated whether any particular DSM-IV
criteria strongly distinguished less from more severe
pathological gamblers. The most dramatic difference
between these two groups was that the more severe
pathological gamblers were more likely to have ever
risked a job or other significant relationship [Risked Rela-
tionships (P < 0.0001)] and to have committed one or
more illegal acts to finance gambling ventures and losses
[Illegal Acts (P < 0.000001)]. The criterion Illegal Acts
was reported by 4.0% of all gamblers meeting one or
more criteria, including 1.3% of those reporting one to
seven criteria and 61.1% of respondents with eight or
more (see Table 2). The highly skewed distribution was
best fit by an accelerating polynomial regression line,
making Illegal Acts the only criterion fit by a `high-
threshold' curve (Fig. 1j). As displayed in Table 3, Illegal
Acts was most strongly associated with Risked Relation-
ships (f = 0.35).
DISCUSSION
This analysis of the distribution of the DSM-IV criteria for
Pathological Gambling among two community-based
samples of gamblers supports the idea that there may be a
hierarchical family of gambling disorders distinguished
qualitatively as well as quantitatively. In other words,
while the severity of gambling problems can be repre-
sented along a continuum, our data indicate that certain
groupings of variables may be highly predictive, or
pathognomic, for four separate patterns: (a) a non-
clinical pattern marked most often by the criterion Chas-
ing, (b) a subclinical pattern of `problem gambling', (c) a
clear differential diagnosis of Pathological Gambling and
(d) a more severe level of Pathological Gambling.
Chasing gambling losses often occurs in the absence of
other criteria, and almost as frequently with very few
other signs as when many are present. While this
behavior may be an important factor in the development
of Pathological Gambling, the way it is currently
operationalized in the NODS appears to differentiate
mainly between no-symptom and few-symptom
gamblers.
Preoccupation with gambling, gambling for emo-
tional escape and lying repeatedly about gambling appear
more frequently than expected among people who may
be labeled `problem gamblers'--that is, those who report
at least three criteria but do not achieve the range of
scores reserved for pathological gamblers. These three
criteria share one central characteristic--namely, an
active fantasy element in which other problems or issues
are wished away, stories are made up to disguise the facts
of gambling behavior, or the gambler's mind is filled with
dreams and plans about future gambling.
These results support Lesieur & Rosenthal's (1998)
contention that there is a need to establish a new diagno-
sis of problem gambling. Aside from the specific compo-
nents described above, what may distinguish such an
entity is its episodic, or possibly self-limiting, nature. Find-
ings from the only available community-based longitudi-
nal study of problem gamblers suggest that, while
problem and pathological gamblers share many charac-
teristics, the less severely affected group is highly transi-
tional. In contrast, while many pathological gamblers
may achieve some degree of natural recovery, a signifi-
cant proportion continues to experience severe gambling-
related problems (Abbott, Williams & Volberg 1999). A
diagnosis of problem gambling, like one of alcohol abuse,
may provide legitimacy for clinicians to intervene thera-
peutically with troubled gamblers before they become
fully pathological.
Withdrawal symptoms and loss of control over wager-
ing--two of the three criteria explicitly modeled on psy-
choactive substance dependence--best mark the
Gambling disorders 1669

threshold of the clinically pathological gambler. With-
drawal and Loss of Control, along with Tolerance, appear
to play important, interrelated roles in Pathological Gam-
bling. This finding adds an important dimension to
Blaszczynski & Nower's (2002) assertion that `[i]mpaired
behavioral control, defined by repeated, unsuccessful
attempts to resist the urge in the context of a genuine
desire to cease, is the central, diagnostic and foundational
feature of pathological gambling' (p. 488).
The centrality of Withdrawal in defining this disorder
is parallel to the results reported by Langenbucher et al.
(2000), who defined a carefully tailored subset of with-
drawal symptoms as providing the necessary and suffi-
cient conditions for Alcohol Dependence. However, our
results do not provide so narrow a predictor, instead
pointing to five of the 10 criteria as ones that distribute in
much the same way, with Withdrawal, Tolerance and
Loss of Control forming a common internalizing compo-
nent of Pathological Gambling and Risked Relationships
and Bailout an externalizing one. Risking important per-
sonal relationships is certainly a salient feature of Patho-
logical Gambling; in a previously reported analysis of the
weighted GIBS data, we found that 53.5% of pathological
gamblers were divorced, compared with 39.5% of prob-
lem gamblers, 29.8% of other gamblers, and 18.2% of
non-gamblers (Gerstein et al. 1999).
A great deal of research in recent decades has indi-
cated that strong propensities for gambling and sub-
stance abuse problems co-occur within individuals (see,
e.g. Levison, Gerstein & Maloff 1983; Thompson, Gazel
& Rickman 1996; Crockford & el-Guebaly 1998;
Feigelman, Wallisch & Lesieur 1998; Abbott et al. 1999;
Gerstein et al. 1999; National Research Council 1999;
Cunningham-Williams et al. 2000; Slutske et al. 2000;
Petry 2001; Volberg 2001; Welte et al. 2001; Blaszczyn-
ski 2002). In fact, the DSM criteria for Pathological Gam-
bling were modeled in part explicitly after the DSM
criteria for Substance-Related Disorders (Lesieur &
Rosenthal 1998). However, while the manual indicates
that the signs of tolerance, withdrawal and loss of control
distinguish a diagnosis of Substance Dependence from
one of Abuse (APA 1994), it does not currently recognize
a hierarchy of diagnostic entities associated with gam-
bling behavior. We believe this analysis provides further
empirical support for the notion that these two disorders
share certain similarities, including a stepwise progres-
sion of severity.
Criminal behavior due to one's gambling losses best
demarcates the most severe level of the disorder. Adverse
financial consequences tend to drive the clinical picture of
pathological gamblers, who often resort to treatment
only when they exhaust all their legitimate avenues
of income and fear the shadow that illegal income
production casts over their future (Lesieur 1977). Arrest
and incarceration histories were much more common
among the most severe pathological gamblers in our sam-
ple. Other studies of pathological gamblers have found
high rates of gambling-related criminal behavior such as
fraud and theft (Brown 1987; Rosenthal & Lorenz 1992;
Blaszczynski & McConaghy 1994; Lesieur & Anderson
1995; Thompson et al. 1996; Lesieur 1998; Abbott &
Volberg 1999; NGISC 1999; National Research Council
1999) while studies of correctional populations have
found high rates of problem and pathological gambling
(Lesieur 1987; Shaffer et al. 1997; Abbott & Volberg
1999; Abbott & McKenna 2000; Abbott, McKenna &
Giles 2000).
It is tempting to ascribe a temporal sequence to the
hierarchies of criteria found in our data: to assume that
Chasing comes first; followed by the emergence of the fan-
tasy-related elements of Preoccupation, Lying and
Escape; followed by the emergence of Withdrawal, Loss of
Control and Tolerance accompanied by increasing levels
of Bailout and Risked Relationships, and finally a descent
into Illegal Acts. However, the cross-sectional nature of
our sample does not permit more than speculation about
developmental ordering and the temporal clustering of
symptoms. To date, we are unaware of any published
community or general population studies on the inci-
dence and detailed time course of this disorder, such as
prospective studies of gamblers, or longitudinal studies to
assesschangeovertimeinindividualpatternsof gambling
participation. Instead, all our information on the natural
history of pathological gambling behavior has been
gleaned from retrospective accounts of pathological gam-
blers, longitudinal data from small clinical samples and
inferences based on differences between life-time and cur-
rent scores on screening measures (Abbott et al. 1999).
The details of our data collection and measurement
strategy may have generated findings that differ from
those that would have been generated using other meth-
ods. First, as in any survey, one or more results may be an
artifact of the sample. We believe that the size, random
selection methods, completion rates and geographically
balanced nature of our sample enable it to represent rea-
sonably well both the stock of gamblers among household
residents and the flow of commercial gambling patrons in
the United States. However, the limited number of clus-
ters in the patron sample may have led to overrepresen-
tation of more senior black clients who live near large
concentrations of slot machines. Also, neither sample
represents fully non-household gamblers such as long-
term prisoners; homeless transients; or high-frequency
private gamblers who do not patronize commercial ven-
ues, who patronize only highly specialized commercial
segments (e.g. off-track betting parlors or `high-stakes'
rooms), or who gamble frequently outside the United
States. Secondly, despite our validity studies and attention
© 2003 Society for the Study of Addiction to Alcohol and Other Drugs Addiction, 98, 1661­1672
1670 Marianna Toce-Gerstein et al.
to the content of the DSM-IV, the question-wording of
NODS items may bias our results.The NODS is one of sev-
eral pathological gambling screens based on the DSM-IV,
and similar analyses of other screeners have not, to our
knowledge, been performed. This caution may be espe-
cially worth noting for the Chasing item, which behaved
so differently from other items.
It is also important to point out that the NODS relies
on self-report of DSM criteria without the benefit of
probes, familial corroboration or clinical judgement.
Severely troubled gamblers who are in denial about many
of the problems their gambling has caused could fall
beneath the diagnostic threshold on the NODS, but not in
formats where a case history would be compiled. We
would also like to remind readers that the NODS was
administered only to those respondents who acknowl-
edged losing $100 or more in a single day or across an
entire year of gambling at some point in their lives. While
this approach may have captured nearly all of the respon-
dents within the survey's respondent populations who
would report three or more problems, it is possible that
the at-risk gamblers, as well as problem gamblers among
the lottery and bingo players, may have been under-reg-
istered, as such players tend to lose smaller amounts on
any given day of gambling (although these losses may
accumulate to substantial sums, such players may not
consider themselves `behind' in the sense that most gam-
blers would).
An additional limitation is that the highly structured
NODS interprets the DSM-IV criteria more literally than
might a clinician or ethnographer. For example, because
the DSM-IV makes no requirement that the symptoms
cluster in time or be currently problematic, individuals
who have experienced a wide variety of problems related
to their gambling--without ever experiencing more than
one or two concurrently--would probably be diagnosed
as pathological gamblers according to the NODS, but pos-
sibly not in another diagnostic format. Results from other
NODS analyses (Toce-Gerstein & Gerstein, in press) indi-
cate that such cases are exceptional, but more research is
needed on the clustering of DSM-IV criteria across time
among gamblers.
Finally, our study is limited by the nature of the DSM-
IV itself, an imperfect guide that is based largely on stud-
ies of treated clinical samples and is indifferent to the
development of Pathological Gambling, among other
empirical and conceptual issues (Widiger & Clark 2000).
The current study is one of a handful that have
attempted to cast their nets beyond specialized groups
(e.g. members of Gamblers Anonymous) into the wider
community. This study is unique in its analysis of the pat-
terning of DSM-IV-defined problems in the subclinical
range, as well as among less and more severely troubled
pathological gamblers. Through its concurrently wider
and yet more narrow focus, it is our hope that this
research will prove to be a valuable contribution to future
work in the prevention and treatment of gambling disor-
ders. These data from community-based epidemiological
surveys in the United States offer important signposts to
direct the further refinement of gambling diagnoses and,
we believe, have relevance to the upcoming revision of the
DSM and International Classification of Diseases. Our
findings suggest that additional elaboration of the diag-
nostic categories used to understand gambling disorders
is due, and that attention should be paid in future studies
to the sequencing, definitional sharpening and weighting
of each criterion. Studies in other countries, such as the
forthcoming World Mental Health data (Kessler 2002),
should provide important cross-cultural validation of the
emerging picture of gambling disorders.
