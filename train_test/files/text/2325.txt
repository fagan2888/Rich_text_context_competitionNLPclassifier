Editorial
Pain policy and abuse of prescription opioids in the USA: a
cautionary tale for Europe
The last two decades have seen a
profound cultural shift in institu-
tional and provider attitudes
towards pain management in
America. Pain and its under-
treatment are widely reported in the
medical literature and media to be
an international health crisis. The
Joint Commission, a major hospital
1210 © 2013 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland
Anaesthesia 2013, 68, 1207­1219 Editorial
regulatory body in the USA, states
that 76 million Americans suffer
from chronic, acute, or post-surgical
pain [1]. The Institute of Medicine
(IOM), a non-governmental USA
advisory organisation, reported this
number to be as high as 100 mil-
lion adults [2], or nearly one in
three Americans. The financial cost
of pain, according to IOM's 2011
report Relieving Pain in America,
ranged between $560 billion and
$635 billion (£367­416 billion;
422­478 billion) in 2010 [2].
Brennan and colleagues describe a
recent `inflection point' in the
international medical, legal, and
ethical worlds, in which the treat-
ment of pain, once long-ignored,
became a fundamental human right
[3]. In 2001, the International Asso-
ciation for the Study of Pain (IASP)
and the European Federation of
IASP Chapters (EFIC) declared to
the European Parliament that
chronic pain is a major healthcare
problem, a disease in itself, and
could affect 50% of people at any
point in time [4]. The World
Health Organization, long a propo-
nent of treatment of acute and can-
cer pain, backed a global day
against pain in 2004, emphasizing
the importance of treating chronic
pain as well [5].
In this editorial, we will explore
both the historical basis of the evo-
lution of pain policy in the USA in
the last two decades and the devel-
opment of an American public
health crisis surrounding the wide-
spread use and misuse of opioids.
We suggest that the American expe-
rience in pain policy is a cautionary
tale for Europe.
Pain becomes a vital sign
in the USA
The 1990s saw a proliferation of con-
sensus statements and regulatory
mandates calling attention to the
problem of pain in all healthcare set-
tings in the USA. In 1992, the
Agency for Healthcare Quality
Research (AHQR), a USA Govern-
ment quality-improvement agency,
issued a two-part guideline declaring
that half of surgical patients, over 10
million Americans, do not receive
adequate post-surgical analgesia, and
that fears of addiction to opioids are
largely unfounded [6, 7]. The con-
cept that addiction is rare in opioid-
na
õve patients treated for acute pain
was supported exclusively by a brief
New England Journal of Medicine
letter in 1980 that described only
four instances of iatrogenic drug
abuse in approximately 12 000
patients treated with narcotics [8].
The AHQR guidelines were widely
disseminated in the media, even
trumpeted by the widely-read New
York Times as the birth of guideline-
driven healthcare [9]. The AHQR
document made clear that pain man-
agement `is a right'. In 1995, the
American Pain Society (APS), a lead-
ing multidisciplinary organisation
that exists to advance pain-related
research, education, treatment and
professional practice (see www.
americanpainsociety.org), developed
a landmark consensus statement
with guidelines for a quality-
improvement approach towards the
treatment of acute and cancer pain
[10], expanding upon its 1989 guide-
lines [11] for the treatment of pain
in the hospital setting. The consen-
sus stated that pain intensity should
be recorded as a part of the patient's
permanent medical record, "such as
on the vital sign sheet". The focus on
analgesic drugs is clear, though the
statement recognises the existence of
non-pharmacological measures to
treat pain [10]. However, no consen-
sus statement, practice guideline, or
committee report had the cultural
and practical impact on the treat-
ment of pain in the USA that the
Joint Commission on Accreditation
of Health Care Organizations (JCA-
HO) did in 2001, with its release of
pain management standards for the
accreditation of healthcare organisa-
tions [1]. What were previously
labelled clinical guidelines and
parameters effectively became prac-
tice mandates that drove provider
and hospital behaviours. The reach
of JCAHO, now known as the Joint
Commission, cannot be underesti-
mated, as it is responsible for accred-
iting and certifying 20 000 American
healthcare organisations to ensure
the `safest, highest-quality care' [12].
The Veteran's Health Administra-
tion (VHA), the USA's largest inte-
grated health system, serving 8.3
million military veterans (see www.
va.gov/health/), became among the
first major health organisations to
join the anti-pain movement. Con-
tinuously documenting pain in the
hope of heightening the awareness of
pain was the cornerstone of the
movement. The VHA adopted the
`fifth vital sign' term and in 1998
enacted a national strategy to ensure
that pain is routinely assessed at all
patient encounters, including in the
ambulatory setting, using a 0­10
numeric rating scale [13]. Govern-
mental, non-governmental, and

pharmaceutical organisations [14]
campaigned vigorously for more
aggressive pain treatment on all
fronts. Despite the noble intention to
reduce pain-related suffering, these
cultural and regulatory shifts have
led to unintended consequences,
especially when the `fifth vital sign'
concept is rolled out to settings
where the presentation is not acute.
Finally, it is difficult to ignore the
influence, even if subtle and when
openly declared, of potential finan-
cial conflicts of interest, with spon-
sorship and/or compensation by the
pharmaceutical industry of leading
societies, clinicians and regulatory
bodies involved with pain advocacy
[14, 15].
The influence of
American pain policies on
opioid prescriptions
Social policy, carried out in the form
of a pain-centered mandate for
accreditation of American healthcare
facilities, with influence from a vari-
ety of consensus and guidelines [6,
10, 16], was successful in increasing
the quantity of opioids prescribed
and consumed by Americans. These
pro-opioid policies were likely to
have been fuelled by the American
health system's payment procedures
that link `patient experience' to
reimbursement, a mechanism that
has been demonstrated to drive
overprescribing and morbidity [17].
The rise in the number of pre-
scriptions written for opioids in
America over the last decade has
been nothing short of astounding.
The estimated number of prescrip-
tions filled for opioid substances
increased from 174 million in 2000
to 257 million in 2009 [18]. Com-
pared with 1997, retail sales of opi-
oid medications in 2007 increased
by 75.8 million grams, an increase
of 149% [19]. This increase in retail
sales corresponded to an increase in
the therapeutic use of opioids by
296 mg per American, a change of
402% [19]. Americans, constituting
less than 5% of the world's popula-
tion, now consume 80% of the
world's opioids and 99% of the
world's hydrocodone [20]. In grams
per person, this is the highest con-
sumption of opioids in the world
[21]. In 2010, enough opioids were
sold to medicate every American
adult with a typical dose of 5 mg
hydrocodone every 4 hours for one
month [22].
Data on the economic impact
of the increasing use of opioids are
limited; however, there is a sugges-
tion that prescriptions for con-
trolled substances represent a
significant proportion of the rising
costs for health insurers, reflecting
an increase in the therapeutic use
of opioids to manage chronic pain
[23]. According to market research
firm Frost and Sullivan, the US opi-
oid pain management market gen-
erated revenues of $11 billion (£7.1;
8.3 billion) in 2009 and is
expected to reach $15 billion (£9.7
billion; 11.3 billion) in 2016 [24].
A new American public
health crisis emerges
Increased medical use of opioids is
directly correlated with increased
abuse as well as subsequent morbid-
ity and mortality [25, 26]. Emer-
gency department visits related to
opioids increased significantly in
the USA in the time that opioid
prescriptions increased [27, 28]. In
some instances, the increases were
equivalent and parallel; in others,
such as in the case of fentanyl,
emergency department attendances
increased 50-fold from 1994 to
2002, while prescriptions increased
by 7.2 times [20]. The Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) reported in
the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report that visits to emergency
departments for non-medical use of
opioids increased 111% between
2004 and 2008, and 29% between
2007 and 2008 [28]. The highest
number of visits involved metha-
done, oxycodone and hydrocodone
[28]. Despite the controversy
around whether data surrounding
emergency room visits and opioid
use has a causal relationship, this
increase is striking [29, 30].
Several national surveys work
to estimate the illicit use of opioids
in the USA, including the National
Survey of Drug Use and Health, the
Monitoring the Future survey
funded by the National Institutes of
Health, and the Drug Abuse Warn-
ing Network [30]. Misuse of Oxy-
Continâ alone increased from 221
000 persons in 1997 to 3 176 800
in 2004 [31]. According to the
National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse at Columbia Uni-
versity (CASA) in 2005, 15.1 mil-
lion people abused prescription
drugs, more than those who admit
abusing cocaine, hallucinogens,
inhalants and heroin combined [32].
Indeed, CASA strongly links the
increase in prescriptions to increase
in abuse, noting that during a time
when the population of the USA
increased by 13%, the number of
controlled drug prescriptions
increased by 154% [32].

The gravity of the American
epidemic cannot be overemphas-
ised. The USA Government
declared abuse of prescription opi-
oid analgesic drugs an epidemic,
and the nation's fastest-growing
drug problem [18]. In 2011, the
CDC reported that American deaths
from opioids exceeded those from
cocaine and heroin combined
between 1999 and 2008 [22]. In
2008, 36 450 people died from drug
overdose overall, a rate of 11.9 per
100 000, a number approaching
deaths from motor vehicle accidents
[22]. The death rate from opioid
overdose in 2008 was four times
higher than in 1999, paralleling the
quadrupling in sales of opioids.
Mortality is one aspect of opioid
harm; the CDC notes that for every
one death from oral analgesics,
there are 10 treatment admissions
for abuse, 32 emergency room visits
for misuse or abuse, 130 people
who are dependent, and 825 who
use the drugs recreationally [33].
The financial burden of misuse is
difficult to quantify; a lower esti-
mate was $8.6 billion (£5.6 billion;
6.5 billion) in the USA in 2001,
consisting of healthcare, criminal
justice and workplace costs [34].
Has widespread opioid
use improved patient
outcomes in America?
Whether the negative health impli-
cations of pain on a public health
level have actually been reduced
since the array of consensus state-
ments and practice mandates is
questionable. Despite the increase
in opioid therapy for non-cancer
pain, neither compelling nor consis-
tent evidence for the long-term effi-
cacy of this therapy exists [35­37].
In fact, scant data are available to
support the claim that on a large
scale, pain management has
improved since the era of mandates
and the explosion of opioid pre-
scriptions. A comprehensive review
exploring the effectiveness of long-
term therapy for chronic, non-
cancer pain highlights the extraordi-
nary paucity of compelling data on
long-term opioid therapy [38]. In
particular, there is limited evidence
to support significant improvements
in functional status and quality of
life among opioid users [39].
What can Europeans learn
from the American
experience?
The literature on prescription opioid
abuse in the European Union is
notably scarce; however, isolated
reports of alarming incidences of
prescription drug abuse within indi-
vidual European Union countries are
emerging [40]. The United Nation's
International Narcotics Control
Board highlights the worldwide mis-
use of prescription drugs and pre-
dicts that it will exceed illicit drug
use [41]. In 2011, the United Nations
published a World Drug Report out-
lining a declining world market for
illicit drugs but a worldwide increase
in demand for prescription opioids
[42]. A report by the European Mon-
itoring Centre for Drugs and Drug
Addiction presents similar concerns
about the misuse of synthetic opioids
[43]. It is our opinion that America
is an epicenter of a potentially
emerging worldwide epidemic. The
vertically integrated healthcare sys-
tems of the UK and much of Europe
are in unique positions to advocate
for effective and safe prescribing of
opioids. Given that the evidence-
based benefits of opioid therapy are
quite limited, best-practice
approaches and formulary recom-
mendations should focus on short-
term and limited use for acute and
non-palliative pain. Additionally, the
NHS should mature its support for
the utilisation of non-opioid pain
therapies such as acupuncture, for
which there is a growing evidence
base and public interest [44]. We
sincerely hope that the UK and other
European countries are able to learn
from the American experience and
avoid the same pitfalls. There is still
time.

Lost in translation? Learning from the opioid epidemic in the USA
Deaths from prescription opioids in
the USA have increased over the
last decade in parallel with an
increase in prescribing of opioids
for pain. In this issue of Anaesthe-
sia, Kotecha and Sites chronicle the
evolution of the opioid misuse `epi-
demic', clearly highlighting a regu-
latory pain management mandate,
as well as aggressive ­ and some
would say questionable ­ marketing
practices on the part of pharmaceu-
tical companies as drivers of
increased prescribing of opioids [1].
However, things may not be so
simple. The association between
increased prescribing and increased
opioid-related harms is multifac-
eted, and these dynamics need fur-
ther exploration if the UK and
others are to learn from the experi-
ence of the USA. The situation in
the UK (where increased prescrib-
ing, to date, hasn't resulted in an
explosion of opioid-related deaths)
should prompt us to drill deeper
into the policies, structural elements
of healthcare delivery, and cultural
aspects of licit and illicit drug use,
that contribute to opioid-related
harms. It is also important to
understand what is at stake, as
efforts to address opioid misuse and
opioid-related harms risk curtailing
access to necessary opioid treatment
and stigmatisation of both patients
who use opioids and providers who
prescribe them.
Controversial role for
opioid analgesics in
persistent pain
The rise in opioid prescribing in
both the USA and the UK is almost
wholly attributable to an increase in
their use for persistent non-cancer
pain [2]. Use of opioids for acute
pain and cancer-related pain at the
end of life is established medical
practice and has support from pub-
lished evidence [3, 4]. By contrast,
the evidence for use of these drugs
for chronic, non-cancer pain, par-
ticularly for prolonged periods, is
scarce in relation to both efficacy
and safety, and epidemiologic stud-
ies have raised the concern that
their use for persistent pain is asso-
ciated with poorer quality of life
[5, 6]. Controversy abounds, and
providers and patients grapple with
basic questions: what are we treat-
ing? What are the goals of therapy?
Chronic pain is common and has
been reported in 22% of patients sur-
veyed across 14 different countries
[7]. As well as tissue damage that
may incite chronic pain, emotions,
behaviours and the outside environ-
