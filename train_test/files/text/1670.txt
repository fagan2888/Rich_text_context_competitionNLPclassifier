SUMMARY Obesity continues to be a major public health issue. In adolescents, there are limited
studies on the relationship between obesity and sleep duration. We found hypothesized
that an average sleep duration of <6 h in adolescents was associated with obesity. Data
were from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (ADD Health); a
survey of 90 000 youths, aged 12­18 years; surveyed in several waves. The sample
population for our study was 13 568. Weighted multiple logistic regression was used to
identify the relationship between obesity at Wave II and sleep duration, having adjusted
for skipping breakfast  2 /week; race, gender, parental income, TV  2 h per day,
depression, and obesity at Wave I. At Wave I, the mean age was 15.96 ± 0.11 years;
mean sleep hours were 7.91 ± 0.04. At Waves I and II, respectively, 10.6 and 11.2% of
adolescents were obese. Adjusted analyses suggest that the effect of shortened sleep
duration in Wave I was not significantly predictive of obesity in Wave II (P < 0.218).
Longitudinally, depression and TV  2 h per day at Wave I was associated with a
higher risk of obesity at Wave II in adjusted analyses. Depressed adolescents were
almost twice as likely to be obese (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.25­2.72); adolescents who
watched TV  2 h per day were 37% more likely to be obese (OR = 1.37, 95%
CI = 1.09­1.72). Environmental factors including TV  2 h per day and depression
were significantly associated with obesity; shortened sleep duration was not. Future
longitudinal studies in adolescents are needed to determine whether timing of television
watching directly influences sleep patterns and, ultimately, obesity.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity continues to be a major health problem (Lee et al.,
2009) because of increasing prevalence and relation to medical
consequences, such as increased risk for diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, heart disease and cancer (Dietz, 2001; Freedman
et al., 2001; Weiss et al., 2004). The effectiveness of weight
management programs is limited (Anderson et al., 2001).
Therefore, the identification of risk factors for obesity, such as
sleep duration, is important as it could lead to additional
preventative strategies. Previous research has identified a range
of risk factors for obesity, including low levels of physical
activity, sedentary behaviour and easy access to energy-dense
foods (Briefel et al., 2009; Epstein et al., 2008; Fisher et al.,
2007; Robinson, 1999). However, evidence continues to
accumulate that short sleep duration may also play a critical
role. One explanation for this link could be that being awake
longer potentially gives children and adolescents more time to
eat and engage in a sedentary lifestyle (Finelli et al., 2006;
Nelson et al., 2006). Multiple cross-sectional studies across the
age spectrum (Hasler et al., 2004) in both genders (Chaput
et al., 2006; Vioque et al., 2000) and from multiple countries
(Park et al., 2009; Patel and Hu, 2008; Vioque et al., 2000)
have identified associations between chronic short sleeping and

increased body mass index (BMI: weight height)2). Further-
more, two studies have reported an association of obesity in
adolescents with sleeping 6 h or less each week night (Noland
et al., 2009; Seicean et al., 2007).
Despite the increasing attention to the connection of sleep
duration and obesity, there are still limited data exploring
these associations in the adolescent population (Gupta et al.,
2002). Extensive research has focused on sleep regulatory
mechanisms and developmental changes in adolescents (Cars-
kadon et al., 1993, 1998; Gibson et al., 2006), but few studies
have evaluated the association of short sleep duration and
obesity in this population. Additionally, a recent meta-analysis
(Cappuccio et al., 2008) of subjects across the lifespan, from
childhood to adulthood, incorporated studies predominantly
from early childhood, not adolescence. Results were based on
bivariate associations between sleep and obesity, without
adjusting for other potential confounders.
In this study, we evaluated the longitudinal relationship
between sleep duration and obesity in a large sample of
adolescents from 12- to 18-years old. Based on previous studies
(Hasler et al., 2004; Vioque et al., 2000; Von Kries et al.,
2002), we hypothesized that an average sleep duration of <6 h
in adolescents was associated with obesity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the University of Pennsylvania. This was a secondary analysis
of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(ADD Health). ADD Health is a survey of youths, grades
7­12, that provided national representation of the U.S. middle
and high school population in 1994­1995. The primary
purpose of ADD Health was to explore the causes of health-
related behaviours of adolescents and their outcomes in young
adulthood (Harris et al., 2003).
Survey procedures, described elsewhere (Resnick et al.,
1997), were approved by the University of North Carolina
Institutional Review Board. In Wave I (1994­1995), >90 000
students completed in-school surveys, and a subset of 20 745
adolescents (and parents) then completed in-home surveys.
Wave II (1996) included 14 738 Wave I adolescents who had
still not graduated from high school, including dropouts. The
two sections of the ADD Health data include the restricted-use
data set and the public-use data set. Key differences between
the two sets of data are that the restricted-use data are the
entire student sample, with more confidential information on
the participants, whereas the public-use data were half of the
total sample (Resnick et al., 1997; Udry et al., 2003). For this
study, the restricted-use data sets from the first two waves were
used.
Outcome measures
Obesity
Height and weight were converted to BMI, the main outcome
variable. Variables were self-reported in Wave I, and self-
reported and objectively measured during home interviews in
Wave II. For consistency, this study utilized self-reported
height and weight. In ADD Health, Goodman et al. (2000)
reported a strong correlation between objectively measured
and self-reported height (r = 0.94, P < 0.0005) and weight
(r = 0.95, P < 0.0005).
Classification of sleep duration
Sleep duration was the main predictor variable of interest this
analysis. For the ADD Health study, one question addressed
length of sleep. In both Waves I and II, adolescents were asked
during the in-home interview ÔHow many hours of sleep do
you usually get?Õ Based on previous studies (Hasler et al., 2004;
Vioque et al., 2000), we defined short sleep duration as <6 h.
Additionally, two other studies have demonstrated some
association with sleep <6 h and obesity in adolescents
(Noland et al., 2009; Seicean et al., 2007). Mean sleep catego-
ries were then divided into <6, 6­8, >8­11 and >11 h sleep.
Adolescents with extreme sleep hours (<2 or > 14 h) were
coded as missing for this analysis. In Wave I, a total of 29
subjects were excluded due to extreme sleep hours; eight with
<1.5 h and 21 with >14 h per night. In Wave II, a total of 15
subjects were excluded due to extreme sleep hours; two with
<1.5 h and 13 with >14 h per night.
Nutrition
Two nutritional variables documented in the literature
(Keski-Rahkonen et al., 2003; Thompson et al., 2003) as
increasing the risk of obesity were assessed. One variable was
the frequency of eating in a fast food restaurant. The other
variable selected was whether children skipped breakfast.
This criterion was selected based on several cross-sectional
studies (Keski-Rahkonen et al., 2003; Melnik et al., 1998;
Siega-Riz et al., 1998) that reported BMI or weights of
children and adolescents who skipped breakfast as being
higher than those who had breakfast. For both these
variables, responses were categorized less than twice a week
or  twice a week.
Physical inactivity
Initially, inactivity score was based on three questions, which
used standard 7-day recall of the number of hours spent: (1)
watching television; (2) watching videos; and (3) playing video
or computer games. Analysis of activity using all three
questions had revealed a peak of 60 h per week of inactivity;
approximately 8.5 h per day. It was thought that these results
may have been erroneous as subjects may have been multi-
tasking or reporting video watching as also television watch-
ing. Therefore, total inactivity score was based on only one
question, the 7-day recall of television viewing. Based on
previous studies reporting that 2 h per day of television
viewing led to an increased risk of weight gain, the total
inactivity score was  categorized 2 h per day or <2 h per day,

with a sedentary lifestyle defined as 2 h per day (Eisenmann
et al., 2008; Gortmaker et al., 1999).
Depression
Depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic
Study-Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D has been widely
used in studies of adolescentsÕ emotional health. Roberts et al.
(1991) used the receiver operating characteristic curve to
analyse data obtained from a large, diverse community sample
of students in grades 9­12. They determined that scores  24
maximized the sensitivity and specificity of the CES-D for
predicting major depressive disorder as defined by the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third
Edition (DSM-III), criteria (Roberts et al., 1991). As used by
Roberts et al. (1991), depression was defined as a cutoff of 24
points. This cutoff was used as a dichotomous variable to
indicate depression.
Additional covariates
Additional covariates included in the analysis were age, race,
gender and parental income. In the ADD Health database,
race was self-identified among the following categories as white
(non-Hispanic), black or African American (non-Hispanic),
Hispanic, Asian American, and other. Socioeconomic status
was based on parental report of household income.
Statistical analysis
The primary outcome for this study was obesity, defined as
BMI > 95th percentile for age. All analyses were performed
using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA), and were conducted using methods for
survey data, with grand sampling weights from Wave II used
to provide nationally representative estimates. Additionally,
the cluster design of the ADD Health study was adjusted for
all analyses. Simple and multiple logistic regression was used
to evaluate the effects of the potential predictive variables on
the risk of obesity. Multiple regressions were adjusted for age,
race, gender, parental income and pre-existing obesity (obesity
at Wave I). A significance level of 0.05 was used for all
analyses.
RESULTS
Adolescents, who completed both Waves I and II, were
included in the sample. Thus, the final sample size was 13 568
adolescents. Demographic variables are shown in Table 1. The
majority of participants were non-Hispanic White, with a
substantial representation of non-Hispanic Black, Hispanics
and Asian Americans.
On average, adolescents slept 7.91 ± 0.04 h in Wave I, with
little change in sleep hours by Wave II (Table 2). In Wave I,
weighted analysis of typical sleep duration showed that the
majority of adolescents slept an average of 8­11 h each night.
Adolescents who slept <6 h represented 3.77% of the sample.
By Wave II, the percentage of adolescents who slept <6 h rose
slightly to 5.06%, with a slight decrease in the 8­11 h sleepers
(OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.27­2.90, P = 0.004).
At Wave I, the mean BMI was 22.21 ± 0.11 kg m)2, with
10.6% of the sample being obese (BMI > 95th percentile;
Table 2). The mean BMI in Wave II was
22.87 ± 0.10 kg m)2. By Wave II, obesity prevalence had
increased to 11.2% (Table 2). Of those adolescents who were
obese at Wave I, 75.14% (n = 1037) were still obese at Wave
II, whereas only 347 adolescents developed obesity between
Waves I and II. Thus, obesity at Wave I was related to obesity
at Wave II (P < 0.001).
Longitudinal relationship with obesity
As shown in Tables 2 and 3, there was a significant association
between short sleep at Wave I and obesity in unadjusted
analyses. Adolescents who had <6 h of sleep in Wave I were
almost twice as likely to be obese in Wave II compared with
adolescents with normal sleep (OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.27­
2.90). However, once adjustments were made for existing
obesity at Wave I, as well as age, gender, race and parental
income, there was no significant association between sleep
duration at Wave I and obesity at Wave II (P = 0.214). This
lack of association between sleep at Wave I and obesity at
Wave II was evident even when considering adolescents who
were (P = 0.374) and were not (P = 0.648) obese at Wave I
separately.
There was an association between sleep duration and
depression. Depressed adolescents tended to sleep less than
non-depressed adolescents at both Waves I and II
(P < 0.001).
Longitudinally, both depression and excessive television
watching at Wave I were associated with a higher risk of
obesity at Wave II in adjusted analyses (Table 4, Model 1).
Depressed adolescents were almost twice as likely to be obese
(OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.25­2.72), whereas adolescents who

watched television excessively were 37% more likely to be
obese (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.09­1.72).
Cross-sectional relationship with obesity
Cross-sectionally, sleep duration at Wave II was not associated
with obesity at Wave II even in unadjusted analyses
(P = 0.157). At Wave II, only excessive television watching
was associated with a higher risk of obesity in adjusted
analyses (Table 4, Model 2). Consistent with Wave I models,
adolescents watching >2 h of TV a day were approximately
36% more likely to be obese (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.04­
1.79).
DISCUSSION
This study is the largest to date evaluating the effect of
shortened sleep duration on obesity, in a sample of 13 568
adolescents. The results do not support the hypothesis that
<6 h sleep has an association with obesity, based on cross-
sectional results in Wave II, and longitudinal results from
Waves I and II. When adjusted for age, race, gender,
socioeconomic status, depression and BMI at Wave I, sleep
duration was not a significant risk factor for the onset of
obesity in Wave II. Instead, television watching for  2 h per
day in Wave I was predictive of obesity in Wave II.
Considering a recent meta-analysis that demonstrated a
consistent increase in obesity among short sleepers in children
and adults (Cappuccio et al., 2008), the results of this study
raise more questions about the causal pathways that may lead
to increased adiposity in adolescents.
Although results were unexpected, these data are consistent
with previous studies of potential environmental risk factors
such as television watching (inactivity or sedentary behaviour)
that may lead to obesity in adolescents (Eisenmann et al.,
2008; Gordon-Larsen et al., 2002, 2003). Television viewing
clearly impacted obesity in Wave II. The majority of adoles-
cents that were obese in Wave I continued to be obese in Wave
II. These results are similar to previous studies, indicating that
prolonged television viewing was associated with obesity in
children and adolescents (Dietz and Gortmaker, 1984).
Television viewing may lead to increased risk of obesity
because watching television has been associated with increased
dietary intake, leading to an imbalance in energy expenditure
(Epstein et al., 2008; Gortmaker et al., 1996; Reilly et al.,
2005; Robinson, 1999). Adolescence is characterized by a steep
drop in physical activity (Kimm et al., 2002; USDHHS, 2001),
an increasing amount of media exposure (Roberts et al., 2005),
inactivity (Kaur et al., 2003) and poor food choices (Palumbo
and Dietz, 1985). As stated earlier, these patterns of behav-
iours appear to be the driving forces behind weight gain in this
age group. In this study, similar to other analyses of the full
ADD Health sample (Gordon-Larsen et al., 1999), television
viewing for >2 h each day and acquired food preferences are
potentially entrenched by adolescence. These factors had
greater association than sleep duration with obesity.

What is still not clear, though, is how the relationship of
timing and amount of television watching and shortened sleep
are associated with obesity. Although we did not find a
relationship between television viewing and sleep in adjusted
analyses, there was a slight correlation between television
viewing and shortened sleep (for Wave I: the correlation was
r = 0.07, P < 0.001; for Wave II: the correlation
was r = 0.02, P = 0.065).
An additional problem is disentangling cause and effect.
Television viewing may result in later sleep onset (Calamaro
et al., 2009). Thus, late night television watching may be a
pathway by which adolescents have shortened sleep duration.
Conversely, because of changing circadian rhythm with
delayed sleep phase (Carskadon et al., 1993), adolescents are
up later, and utilize television or similar sedentary behaviours
to fill the void (Eggermont and Bulck, 2006). Future longitu-
dinal studies in adolescents are needed to determine at what
time of the night adolescents are viewing television, and
whether the timing directly influences sleep patterns and,
ultimately, obesity.
Additionally, longitudinal studies evaluating obesity, sleep
duration and environmental factors, such as inactivity and food

intake, need to start in early childhood. The differing results
between studies of adolescents and sleep and obesity may be
because of study design differences. Study results from younger
children under 11-years old appear uniform, despite differences
in the definition of short sleep (Patel and Hu, 2008). Patel and
Hu (2008) in a recent systematic review of sleep duration and
obesity reported 11 cross-sectional studies, all of which iden-
tified a positive association between sleep duration and weight
gain in predominantly school age children under 11-years old.
Only four studies, with varying results, have examined the
relationship of sleep in adolescents. Differences in definitions of
short sleep duration varied across studies, as did the potential
confounders addressed. Additionally, differences may be
because of study methods, or may in part reflect a more
complex relationship between sleep duration and weight in this
age group because of onset of puberty (Patel and Hu, 2008).
Because depression is associated with sleep abnormalities
(Kessler et al., 2003), such as complaints of hypersomnia or
insomnia (Kripke et al., 2002; Ter Wolbeek et al., 2008), the
influence and bidirectional relationship of depression on sleep
and weight gain was considered. In the ADD Health adoles-
cent population, over 9% of adolescents were reported to have
moderate symptoms of depression (Rushton et al., 2002). It
was important, therefore, to determine the confounding
influence, if any, of depression on sleep and weight gain.
When included and excluded as a variable in the analysis, it
was clear that depression did play a factor in shortened sleep
duration leading to weight gain in this population. Given that
sleep duration as well as obesity are affected by depressive
symptomatology (DiPietro et al., 1992; Perlis et al., 1997),
including depression as a potential cofounder adds strength to
the results of this study.
Data for the original study were collected on these adoles-
cents in 1995. Since that time, there has been an explosion of
media-related technology available for use at any time of the
day or night. Adolescents engage others through computer
games, mobile phones to text friends, and surfing the internet
(NSF, 2006). These technologies were not available at the time
these data were collected. Sleep is potentially impacted
through late night use of these devices, and surveying
adolescents regarding technology use in the 21st century may
provide different results (Calamaro et al., 2009).
Another limitation could be that a 1-year follow up may
potentially not be a sufficient amount of time to explore a
potential relationship between short sleep duration and BMI.
In our study, this may be particularly important given that
there were only a small number of new cases of obesity
between Wave 1 and Wave 2. An additional limitation of this
study was that validated sleep questionnaires were not
included in the ADD Health survey, and sleep duration was
self-reported. In addition, sleep duration was limited to a
single question. A previous study has found that self-reported
sleep duration estimates are similar to actigraphy (Wolfson
et al., 2003), however, it is possible that at the time of
completion of the questionnaire, mood, stress and environ-
ment could have influenced self-reported sleep duration and
potentially confounded its association with BMI. Another
limitation was that the study was observational and, thus, only
associations could be presented.
Use of BMI as a measure of adiposity rather than a direct
measurement of obesity, such as skin-fold thickness, could be
considered another limitation, To date, BMI has been strongly
correlated to measures of adiposity in children and adolescents
(Lindsay et al., 2001; Pietrobelli et al., 1998), insulin sensitivity

in children (Freedman et al., 2001), and diastolic blood
pressure measurements (Freedman et al., 2001). Because of
this, BMI is a well-validated marker of adiposity and increased
risk of morbidity in children and adolescents.
CONCLUSION
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
provides the largest data set to date describing sleep duration
and association with obesity. With the results of this study, the
question may be raised as to how sleep can have an association
with obesity in young children, not through adolescence, but
again in adults. It is possible that, as obese children enter
adolescence; key environmental factors such as inactivity play
a much greater role than sleep duration. However, as these
adolescents enter adulthood, sleep duration may play a bigger
role as inactivity and poor nutrition continue, and comorbid-
ities such as obstructive sleep apnoea, metabolic syndrome or
hypertension develop, creating a vicious cycle (Fogelholm
et al., 2007). Further research, particularly longitudinal studies
with objective measurements of sleep, activity and nutrition, is
needed to determine the biological mechanism underlying the
association between short sleep duration and weight gain.
