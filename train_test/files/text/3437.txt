Introduction
Many authors claim that sexuality is socially and culturally
constructed (Andersen, 2005; Benkert, 2002; Jackson &
Scott, 2007; Rosenblum & Travis, 2002; Seidman, 2002)
and that the media play an important role in defining sexu-
ality (Hust, Brown, & L'Engle, 2008; Jackson & Westrupp,
2010; Ringrose & Barajas, 2011; Vares, Jackson, & Gill,
2011). The study of sexuality and media has been developed
particularly in the context of feminist research. The media
were a focus of feminist attention (van Zoonen, 1994) dur-
ing the three waves of feminist movements. The media
assumed particular relevance during the third wave, espe-
cially in the context of postmodern feminism (Nogueira,
2001) and postfeminism (Genz & Brabon, 2009; Tavares,
1998, 2000). The postfeminism movement emerged from
combinations and intersections between the media, con-
sumer culture, neoliberal policies, postmodern theory, and
feminist assumptions (Genz & Brabon, 2009; McRobbie,
2009). Today, feminist research on the media is an innova-
tive project that joins cultural studies, media, and commu-
nication. Feminist research embraces a dimension that is
political, complex, multidisciplinary (Gallagher, 2006), and
socioculturally focused (Devereux, 2007) with respect to
sexuality and female subjectivity.
For example, in the advent of feminist scholarship on the
media, we highlight the work of Betty Friedan's (1963/2010)
Feminine Mystique, which analyzes the representations of
housewives particularly in women's magazines of the
1960s. Since then, many studies have focused on the role of
women's magazines in the construction of female subjectiv-
ity and the way in which women experience their sexuality
(Carpenter, 1998, 2001; Currie, 1999, 2001; Jackson, 2005;
Kehily, 1999; McRobbie, 1991, 1996; Pierce, 1990, 1993).
Cultural discourses and practices, which include the
media, define norms and values for feminine and masculine
sexuality and construct gendered standards for both expected
and unexpected sexual behaviors (Jackson & Gee, 2005;
Jackson & Westrupp, 2010; Magalhães, 2011). Sexuality is,
therefore, the product of specific social, cultural, and histori-
cal factors, and it also outlines social and gender relations
(Benkert, 2002; Magalhães, 2011; Saavedra, Nogueira, &
Magalhães, 2010). It is used to justify gender differences and
perpetuates gender beliefs, expectations, values, and rules.
(Hetero)sexuality and gender are, therefore, intrinsically
related--they are not the same, but sexuality reveals gender
constructions, and both in turn constrain sexual practices
(Jackson & Scott, 2007).
Cross-cultural studies indicate that these norms, values,
and practices vary within different contexts (e.g., Benkert,
2002) and have suggested the possibility of more subtle
microvariations. For example, Williams's (2002) study,

From "Chastity As a Gift" to "Doing It As a
Sign of Love":A Longitudinal Analysis of the
Discourses on Female Sexuality in Popular
Magazines in Portugal
Ana Rita Conde Dias1, Carla Machado1, and Miguel Gonçalves1
Abstract
This study aims to analyze the media discourse about feminine sexuality produced by Portuguese magazines.Texts about
female sexuality published in six types of magazines between 1965 and 2006 were content analyzed. The results showed
that Portuguese media's discourse on sexuality is not only becoming more liberal but is also characterized by ambiguity
and contradiction.Within a "progressive" discursive framework for sexuality, tensions and double standards for women are
still noticeable.The media discourse in Portugal continues to reinforce the established gender hierarchy and inequality in
heterosexual relationships and maintain traditional gender roles.

conducted in the United States using two groups of adoles-
cent girls, showed clear differences in the construction of
femininity that was linked to the specific sociocultural char-
acteristics of the two groups. Skeggs (2003, as cited in
Jackson & Scott, 2004) added that norms for feminine sexual
"decency" are different for each social class: For middle-
class women with economic resources, sexual encounters are
seen as a means to affirm autonomy, freedom, or status,
while the same behavior from lower-class women incites
social dislike and pejorative labeling.
Despite these macro- and microcultural variations, most
cultures endorse different expectations, rules, and values for
both genders, and the global tendency is toward the restric-
tion and subordination of female sexuality (Benkert, 2002;
Hust et al., 2008).
The notion that gender norms for sexuality follow a dou-
ble standard (Alferes, 1997; Hust et al., 2008; Jackson &
Scott, 2004; Nogueira, Saavedra, & Costa, 2008) that encour-
ages women to marry (Cancian & Gordon, 1988; Erel, 2011;
Press, 2011) and permits men to have multiple sexual liai-
sons (Alferes, 1997; Saavedra et al., 2010) is not new. What
is perhaps more noticeable is the pervasiveness of these stan-
dards in a time of the apparent "liberation"/"banalization" of
sexuality, in which several authors have discussed the "sexu-
alization of culture" (Gill, 2008; Ringrose, 2011) and the
"hyper-sexualization" of women (Gill, 2008, 2010).
In fact, although a discourse of apparent liberation and
"openness" prevails in popular and media representations,
some studies reveal anomalies and contradictions within
these discourses (Alferes, 1997; Crawford & Popp, 2003;
Jackson & Scott, 2004, 2007). Tolerance of casual and pre-
marital sexual relationships occurs simultaneously with the
hope of a serious, loving relationship (Jackson, 2001); toler-
ance of homosexuality and serial relationships coexists with
the reinforcement of heterosexuality and monogamy as an
ideal (Harvey & Gill, 2011; Jackson & Scott, 2004). This
coexistence of change and continuity is, as suggested by
Jackson and Scott (2004), "indicative of a persistent unease
about the sexual that sits side by side with an acceptance of
greater sexual freedom and diversity" (p. 235).
Whereas some authors argue that heterosexual relation-
ships are more equal today--that is, women are encouraged
to play an active role, to express their sexual needs and feel-
ings, to have sexual pleasure and satisfaction (Andrews,
2003; Giddens, 1992; Johnson et al., 2001; Ringrose, 2011)--
others assert that asymmetries persist (Cancian & Gordon,
1988; Harvey & Gill, 2011; Jackson & Scott, 2007; Jackson
& Vares, 2011; Magalhães, 2011), mainly in specific socio-
cultural contexts. In Europe, studies indicate gender differ-
ences regarding sexual activity (onset and number of
partners), and Portugal is the country in which this difference
is most evident (Ross, Godeau, & Dias, 2004). A comparative
study of several European countries indicated that only 20.3%
of Portuguese girls claimed to be sexually active, compared
with 30.2% of boys (Avery & Lazdane, 2008). Other studies
reveal that boys have a greater number of relationships (an
average of three) than do girls, who have an average of one
partner (Monteiro & Raposo, 2005).
Many studies developed in Portugal reveal the gender dif-
ferences in the experience of sexuality: Boys become sexu-
ally active earlier than girls, while the rate of virginity is more
pronounced in girls (Alferes, 1997; Monteiro & Raposo,
2005) and boys have more sexual partners than do girls.
Studies indicate that there is a perpetual asymmetry of affec-
tive expectations: Whereas boys' achievements are deter-
mined by the number of relationships, women are still
attached to the romantic aspect and exclusivity of each
romantic involvement (Saavedra et al., 2010).
In Portugal, along with these studies about sexual behav-
ior and attitudes, some research groups and authors have
also analyzed the media in relation to gender and feminist
studies. For example, Silveirinha (2001, 2004, 2006) char-
acterizes the evolution of feminist media studies in Portugal;
Mota-Ribeiro (2002, 2005) analyzes the representation of
women in the Portuguese press and in the publicity spots;
Cerqueira, Magalhães, Cabecinhas, and Nogueira (2011)
analyze gender representations in news magazines; and
Magalhães (2011) analyzes the discourses of sexuality in a
teenage girls' magazine. Globally, these studies reveal the
persistence of gendered representations in media content
(Cerqueira et al., 2011) and show that women and girls are
exposed to contradictory messages, from an emancipation
discourse to a discourse of subservience (Magalhães, 2011;
Mota-Ribeiro, 2005). The studies also reveal the presence of
a discourse that objectifies and minimizes women
(Magalhães, 2011; Mota-Ribeiro, 2005), therefore produc-
ing a hegemonic and androcentric vision that prevents an
inclusive and equal citizenship (Cerqueira et al., 2011).
In fact, despite the transformations occurring in Western
societies, there are differences between different countries
and their sociocultural contexts (Benkert, 2002; Gill &
Scharff, 2011). It is important to understand the transforma-
tions of sexuality within their social, cultural, historical, and
political backgrounds. In this respect, Portugal is a country
with cultural specificities that should be analyzed: Three
decades ago, the Portuguese lived under a dictatorial politi-
cal regime in which women were considered inferior and
women were considered to be the property of the husband or
father; women were not encouraged to work; divorce was
not possible; and women were supposed to only have one
boyfriend whom they should marry and have children with
(Amâncio, 1998; Dias & Machado, 2007). In Portugal,
which is a very Catholic country where politics and religion
are united, the highest values are summarized in the follow-
ing phrase: "God, Family and Country" (Pimentel, 2000). It
was not until April 25, 1974, that a revolution took place and
gave rise to a democratic period. Despite a period of struggle
and the consolidation of rights and equality for women, in
which the feminist movement played an important role, gen-
der disparities still persist, and the old "values" remain in the
Conde Dias et al. 3
context of sexuality and relationships (Dias, Machado,
Manita, & Gonçalves, in press; Saavedra et al., 2010). As
Giddens (1992, pp. 12-13) states, "in many contexts, how-
ever, such transitions are happening against the backdrop of
more constraining sexual values than were characteristic of
American society several decades ago. For women living in
these contexts, the transformations now occurring are dra-
matic and shattering" with respect to their social integration
and acceptance and their own negotiation of their gender,
cultural, and even religious identity (see Machado, Dias, &
Coelho, 2010).
As mentioned above, social "reality" is mostly constructed
by the media. Media discourses are important resources that
people use to construct/support ways of understanding many
social problems and phenomena, such as sexuality, sexual
relationships, and gender identity. Several media studies on
gender issues and gender relationships have been conducted
in the last several decades (e.g., Cancian & Gordon, 1988;
Carll, 2003; Firminger, 2006; Fraser, 2005; Jackson, 2001,
2005; Jackson & Vares, 2011; Jackson & Westrupp, 2010;
Novikova & Raynor, 2003; Rogers, 2005; Tyler, 2004; Vares
et al., 2011) revealing that the media reinforce specific gender
images and meanings, namely, hegemonic masculinity (male
authority, ability, and strength) and submissive femininity
(dependency, sexual receptivity/passivity, and mothering). In
fact, several studies of women's magazines reveal their
emphasis on heterosexual femininity, beauty, and fashion
(Brown Travis, Meginnis, & Bardari, 2000; Magalhães,
Saavedra, & Nogueira, 2008; Mota-Ribeiro, 2002, 2005)
along with the reinforcement of predominant gender stereo-
types about sex (Hust et al., 2008; Jackson & Westrupp, 2010;
Mota-Ribeiro, 2005; Taylor, 2005).
Many studies on this subject have been conducted, but
few studies have used a longitudinal analysis (e.g., Cancian
& Gordon, 1988; Carpenter, 1998; Jackson & Gee, 2005)
through which it would be possible to identify and under-
stand the variations in public discourses about this theme
over time.
In this study, we develop a longitudinal analysis (over a
40-year period) of media discourses because the social con-
struction of female sexuality must be understood in its
sociocultural and political context given the profound
changes in Portugal.
A Longitudinal Study of Media Discourse
in Portugal on Female Sexuality
Objectives
The main goal of this study is to characterize the dominant
sociocultural discourses (and their transformations) with
respect to feminine sexuality in Portugal, from 1965 to the
present, and to analyze the potential implications of these
discourses on the construction of female sexuality.
Before presenting our methodology and results, it is
important to note the way the relationship between media
discourse and the meanings and realities of individuals
exposed to this discourse is conceptualized in this article. A
dialectic relationship exists between the media and society
(Devereux, 2007; Gallagher, 2006). On one hand, the media
discourse on sexuality is a product and mirror of predomi-
nant sociocultural representations and practices. On the other
hand, those media representations contribute to the sociocul-
tural construction of sexuality, thus reinforcing or changing
social patterns of behavior and thoughts (Gallagher, 2006;
Magalhães, 2011).
It is important to note that there is no cause­effect rela-
tionship between media discourse and individual beliefs or
behaviors. From a social constructionist perspective, media
discourse is anchored in social reality, reflecting not only the
predominant social norms but also the diversity of values
and behaviors that characterize the social world. These dis-
courses constitute important resources for people trying to
make sense of the world (Potter & Wetherell, 1992), but the
public is not merely a passive recipient of media discourse.
On the contrary, several studies suggest that people are able
to critically analyze media content and that they seek infor-
mation that reinforces their previous views of the world
(Sacco, 1995). In this article, although we do not consider
the way media content is understood by the public, this is an
important point to keep in mind in order not to reify the
results of media content analysis, such as those we will pres-
ent next.
Method
Sample. An extended 40-year period (from 1965 to 2005)
of media production was considered and included materials
corresponding to different phases of the recent sociopolitical
history of Portugal and the corresponding transformations in
social practices and discourses. This framework allowed for
the inclusion of materials from three distinct phases of recent
Portuguese sociopolitical history: the fascist regime (that
lasted until 1974), the revolutionary period (from 1974 to the
late 1970s), and the democratic regime (from the late 1970s
to the present).
Within this time frame, magazines were selected accord-
ing to their accessibility (preference was given to large dis-
tribution titles), target audience (women, men, adolescents,
and the general public), and the content profile (generalist,
"society/celebrities," and "romantic/interpersonal"). This
selection led to a final sample of 10 magazines distributed
according to six different profiles: "general content" for the
adult public (Selecções), "general content" for the adult
female public (Modas e Bordados, Máxima), "generalist
content" for the adult male public (Men's Health), "roman-
tic/interpersonal content" for the female public (Crónica
Feminina, Maria), "romantic/interpersonal content" for the
4 SAGE Open
adolescent feminine public (Menina e Moça, Ragazza), and
"society/celebrity content" for the adult female public
(Flama, Nova Gente). Whenever a magazine was no longer
published, it was substituted by a publication of magazines
with a larger circulation and a similar profile.
It must be noted that the initiation of a true media culture
only began at the end of the 20th century. Until the 1970s,
illiteracy rates were very high (26%-40%), mainly in rural
areas and among women. Therefore, reading was only preva-
lent among societies' elites (Barreto, 2002). Moreover, the
fascist government controlled editorial policies and contin-
ued to promote its rigid ideology. During the dictatorship,
censorship acts were extremely aggressive. These censorship
acts included the confiscation and destruction of books; the
persecution of authors, publishers, and booksellers; the forced
closings of printers; and the preliminary examination of all
printed material (Medeiros, 2010). Consequently, the analy-
ses of magazines of the 1960s and 1970s should be consid-
ered case studies that help to illustrate the representation of
women (and female sexuality) under a dictatorship.
Moreover, because of this repression and censorship of
publishers and printers, the magazines that existed during the
dictatorship cannot be compared with recent magazines in
terms of content or editorial policy. Nevertheless, we
attempted to maintain equivalence in terms of target audi-
ence, circulation, and publisher (e.g., "Flama" was replaced
by "Nova Gente" for the "Impala" publisher).
The sample was collected in 5-year intervals (1965, 1970,
1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005), and two
annual editions of each magazine were analyzed (March and
September).
Analysis,coding,and validation procedures. The analysis pro-
cedure consists of three main stages: (a) collection of maga-
zines and the selection, within each magazine, of texts that
addressed the theme of female sexuality; (b) transcription of
all the identified texts (270); and (c) coding and analysis of
data using the NUD*IST 4 (Nonnumerical Unstructured
Data Index, Searching and Theorizing) software.
All coding was inductively derived using an inclusive
coding approach (Fielding, 1993) based on the principles of
grounded analysis (Strauss & Corbin, 1997). The coding unit
was the phrase.
For validation purposes, 10% of the texts were randomly
selected and co-codified by a "blind" researcher, reaching an
index of fidelity of 0.8. This result was considered a substan-
tial force of agreement.1
Results
Descriptive Presentation of Media Discourse
A data analysis revealed substantial transformations in the
media discourse about female sexuality over time.
In 1965, there were few references to sexuality (8)2 and,
when present, they were mainly indirect, conveying a
negative connotation of feminine sexuality. The importance
of a woman's virginity was stressed (8; "It is better to be a
`no' girl than a `yes' girl"; "To have fun with a girl is a fling;
to marry her is another matter"). Women's sexuality was only
accepted within marriage and, even in this case, references
to sexual life emerged only using covert language ("The
married couple should also reach physical harmony").
In 1970, the number of references to the theme increased
(23) and sexuality was described more explicitly. Sex was
considered a basic need for men (2; "Sometimes the hus-
band's most pressing need is sex") and a women's matrimo-
nial duty, whose denial justifies male dissatisfaction and
even infidelity (3; "Some women don't understand the
urgency of their husband's needs, and later they feel hurt and
shocked when those needs cause him to pursue an affair").
Women's virginity (10) remained an extremely valued
personal trait ("Chastity or dignity--as you prefer to call it--
. . . is the soul's beauty and a girl's delicacy"). The defense of
time-honored moral values was reinforced through strict
societal norms by which young women were expected to
abide. This expectation was in clear contrast to the sexual
perverseness that was thought to be taking place in other
European countries (8) ("Living in a consumer society, hav-
ing money, being surrounded by an amoral culture, young
people aspire to a natural ideal . . . : God, Family, Work, and
Homeland").
After the democratic revolution that occurred in Portugal
in 1974, references to sexuality in magazines from 1975
decreased (5), but their content changed substantially.
Sexuality was no longer understood as something negative
or as a reason for feeling guilty ("Physical understanding and
loving accomplishment are not accompanied by guilty feel-
ings"), and the need for sexual education was mentioned for
the first time ("There isn't a rational preparation for marriage
in many countries, and a few years ago, sexual subjects and
the teaching of certain hygienic precepts to young people
were considered awful"). Some references to sexual pleasure
and women's active role in sexuality appeared for the first
time (3; "The woman should not have merely a passive role
and should also achieve physical satisfaction"). It should,
however, be noted that sexuality remained linked only to the
marital couple and that the language used to describe it
mainly emphasized the physiological dimension of sex (e.g.,
"hygienic precepts," "physical reward").
This period was also unique because of the emergence of
a critical discourse on women's social exploitation as sexual
objects (5; "They are exploited as sexual objects by all
consumer society structures"), namely, in the context of
media discourse (6; "Publicity is the most insidious means of
perpetuating women's depreciative images as sexual symbols
and inferior human beings"). It is important to note that this
critical discourse will not reappear in the subsequent years of
this analysis.
In fact, during the 1980s, sexuality nearly disappeared
from media discourse, apart from tenuous references to
Conde Dias et al. 5
female contraception in 1980 (2; "The doctor spoke to us
about the pill"). In 1990, sexuality continued to be scarcely
referenced (6), even if sex was then, for the first time,
described as a central aspect of life (4; "Sex is everywhere,
and to speak of life is to speak of sex"; "sex is the cause of
all pleasant and unpleasant things, of happiness and suicide,
of connections and ruptures").
In 1995, sexuality became a central theme in the maga-
zines' discussion of affective relationships (140). Couples'
sexuality was then described as a learning process (3; "To
learn this language can take years"), and sexual communica-
tion was characterized as communication based on codes one
should learn to reach satisfaction and mutual understanding
(13; "Between husband and wife there is always a secret code
to express what they want"). There were recommendations
for a satisfactory sexual life that emphasized communication
("Open communication is the best way of achieving a satis-
factory sexual life") and romanticism (4).
Regarding male sexuality, we found that men were
understood to have higher levels of sexual interest and needs
than women (15; "Most of the men are ready for immediate
sexual relationships"). Male worries about their sexual
performance and their fear of female evaluation were also
addressed (3; "A man is always concerned about a woman's
judgment of his masculinity, of his performance, of his
penis, of everything!").
Although with a critical tone, notions corroborating a tra-
ditional conception of gender roles during sex were con-
veyed (9). These notions were either presented as male
dysfunctional beliefs ("When men begin to think about a
woman as their future wife, they may begin to treat her as
sacred rather than sexy") or as patterns of thinking involving
female inadequacy (14; "Instead of going to bed as the rap-
turous and crazy woman she was when they met each other,
she now comes as a diligent and well-behaved wife, who
becomes disturbed by ardent sexual practices--because now
she is thinking about marrying him"). Following the same
rationale, women were portrayed as self-restraining and men
as more prone to engaging in sex (12). This fact, however, is
no longer presented as a natural occurrence but as a result of
socialization ("Women are conditioned to wait, indepen-
dently of what they feel, whereas men are not. For men, sex
is good and that is reason enough for seeking it"). Because of
this female restraint, women's sexual receptivity was
described as ambiguous (14; "Many men think that women
send them ambiguous signs, and it becomes difficult to know
if they want to say `no' or if they want to be persuaded").
The double standard regarding sexuality was still present
when discussing sexually transmitted diseases and their pre-
vention. The use of condoms was mainly described as a
male reaction to the disease, and sexual "withdrawal" was
portrayed as the predominantly female way of coping with
that risk (3; "In the AIDS era, sex has some dangerous
implications, but most of the men handle this risk by using
condoms"; "Women also think about AIDS when they
decide to make love with a man. And they think about other
subtle implications of their sexual behavior. They ask if he
will continue to respect them; they think about whether they
will keep their self-respect and they think about the changes
that sex can bring to the relationship. Because of this, it is
less probable that women `move forward' without further
ado. Women become reserved").
Adolescents' sexual initiation was also addressed for the
first time in the mid-1990s. Sex with a boyfriend was then
presented as something positive and natural, but only under
certain conditions: in the context of a loving relationship (7;
"If you are truly in love and he loves you"), under absolute
certainty about the partner and the decision (8; "If you are
completely sure about wanting to do it," "If you don't have
any doubts about the person whom you chose"), after pro-
longed discussion (3; "If you and your boyfriend talked hon-
estly enough about the subject"), and if the girl had good
self-esteem (5; "Ifyoufeel goodabout yourbody").Following
this logic, several pieces of advice were offered to girls about
how to resist pressure from their boyfriends (7; "If he loves
you, he will wait"). Curiously, despite the educational tone
these magazines adopt when addressing their audience, birth
control was only mentioned once ("You should visit a Family
Planning Center or, at least, be seen by a gynecologist").
This attention given to sexuality, especially adolescent
sexual behavior, remained present in 2000 (57). The maga-
zines provided advice regarding the girl's first time with her
boyfriend (17), techniques on how to discover the boy's
level of experience, and female initiative (7; "Make the first
move: If you don't want to wait for his decision, you should
go for the attack"). Woman's sexual pleasure was portrayed
as something important (2; "Enjoy every caress, every
word"), while contraception was scarcely mentioned
although described as fundamental (2; "Even if he takes an
oath that he will stop on time, or says that there is no danger
because you are menstruating or because it is the first time,
there always exists the possibility of you becoming pregnant
or of contracting an STD").
Finally, in 2005, the media continued to focus on sexual-
ity (92), not only in magazines for young girls but also in
ones for the adult public (male and female). For the first
time, male heterosexual prostitution was mentioned (4) and
the reasons behind women's desire for these sexual services
were discussed: as a means to achieve an affective relation-
ship (5), to save one's marriage, as a result of having marital
problems, or just because they fall in love with the man and/
or with "their athletic bodies." Ambiguity was evident in the
media presentation of this theme. On one hand, the media
suggested that paying for sex is a form of sexual equality (4;
"Women should have the same rights as men") but, on the
other, the media emphasized the emotional needs of female
customers and not their search for physical satisfaction.
On the whole, differences between female and male sexu-
ality were again emphasized, characterizing women as more
reserved than men either because of biological reasons or
6 SAGE Open
cultural conditioning (4; "For biological and social reasons,
the female impulse is more socialized, more repressed.
However, the costs of an unwanted pregnancy are much
higher for women"; "Men are taught to achieve love through
sex and women are taught to achieve sex through love").
Integrative Analysis of the Results
As a second step in our analysis, we went back to the data to
resolve three main research questions: (a) the possibility of
distinguishing different time periods in the media discourse
on sexuality, (b) the discursive continuities and discontinui-
ties that are present in these magazines, and (c) the discur-
sive differences between magazines designed for different
target audiences.
a. Discursive changes over time
Changes in the number and content of references to sexu-
ality make it possible to differentiate three distinct periods in
the media discourse on female sexuality: (a) 1965-1970 was
characterized by a "traditional," negative discourse on sexu-
ality; (b) 1975 was an important year and a landmark of
change, with a more positive view of sexuality to be devel-
oped further in subsequent years; and (c) the years from 1975
to the present were marked by the importance attributed to
this topic (especially since the 1990s) and by ambiguous
language, alternating between a "liberated" version of female
sexuality and a permanent return to traditional gender roles
and behavioral prescriptions for women.
These three periods directly correspond to the three dif-
ferent phases of recent sociopolitical life in Portuguese his-
tory. In a more detailed analysis, magazine language in the
1965 and 1970 magazines, which was produced under the
fascist regime that ruled Portugal between 1928 and 1974,
presented female virginity and modesty as the main definer
of a woman's social and moral values and as essential con-
ditions for marriage. Marriage, however, was perceived as a
woman's main objective in life and as her unique pathway
to achieving social respectability and a personal sense of
accomplishment and self-esteem. In this context, sex was
constructed as something dangerous for women, and female
sexuality was seen as a source of vulnerability; on one hand,
a woman must be protected (by her family) and, on the other
hand, the girl must restrain her own (rarely admitted) desire
and simultaneously control her boyfriend's sexual impulses
without seeming to reject him ("say no with the mouth and
yes with the eyes"). This difficult equilibrium is presented
by the media as the means to preserve and enhance girls'
moral and social values and to protect their opportunities in
the "marriage market."
In 1975, the year after the democratic revolution in
Portugal and when there were was a strong Communist
influence on Portugal's government and political life, this
discourse was substantially altered, with sexuality presented
as a normal, physiological need for both men and women. At
this time, the media discourse adopted a normalizing and
educational tone, presenting a positive image of sexuality
that clearly resonated with communist aesthetics of the body
(functionality, strength, activity). This positive stance toward
sex was not, however, free from ambiguity. The media essen-
tially avoided the theme of female pleasure and instead
focused on the sexual exploitation of women. While it is
commendable that the media uncovered a widely known but
unspoken reality, we must note that this theme once again
resonates with the way communists perceive women as part
of the explored classes, vulnerable not only by their lesser
wages but also by the vulnerability caused by their gender. It
must be noted that the female body and sexuality were still
conceived of as sources of vulnerability and powerlessness
for women (whereas the male body was represented as domi-
nant, strong, and powerful).
From 1980 to the present (years of consolidation of the
democratic regime), the political tone of the 1975 language
vanished and "old" notions (e.g., female sexual modesty, vir-
ginity) reappeared, coexisting with numerous references to
women's sexual needs and rights, in a discourse marked by
ambiguity and inner contradictions.
b. Changes and continuities in media discourse
Significant differences between the first years we ana-
lyzed and the present are quite noticeable. These differences
refer both to the visibility of the theme in media discourse
and to its content. Although sexuality was hardly ever men-
tioned during the first years, it has proliferated in magazines
for female adolescents since 1995.
The discursive content is also quite different, as mentioned
previously. Although in 1965 and 1970, sexuality was
regarded as something to avoid and only conceivable within
the context of marriage, in 1975, sexuality appeared with a
positive connotation. At present, it is presented in an ideal-
ized and romantic way in adult women's and adolescent mag-
azines. Sexual life is not presented as restricted to married
couples, and marriage is no longer presented as the main goal
of entering a relationship. Adolescent magazines note that
adolescent girls may have several boyfriends and sexual part-
ners, and they focus on female sexual satisfaction, initiative,
and pleasure. Female sexual satisfaction is, in fact, presented
almost as a duty or as a goal to be reached, and sexual perfor-
mance is described as a central ingredient for women's self-
esteem and sense of personal accomplishment and as essential
to a normative and satisfactory intimate relationship.
Despite these important changes, traditional notions
about female sexuality remain present, as shown in the
following example:
1965: "For marriage, they want a girl morally intact,
because . . . to form a home and choose their chil-
dren's mother--that is a serious thing!"
Conde Dias et al. 7
1995: "Can a boy notice that you are no longer virgin?
Or is possible to deceive him?" "Tell him that all
your sexual experience comes from hearing people
talk about it"; "Act coy when he tries to find out
your previous relationships."
Virginity is one of these areas of discursive continuity,
even though it is no longer viewed as a marker of a girl's
moral value. The emphasis is now placed on the social dis-
approval that the knowledge of the girl's past could bring up
and its effects on her present relationship with her boyfriend,
assuming that he will be uncomfortable knowing about her
sexual experiences. This orientation is thus more pragmatic
than moral, with girls being told that it is normal to have
several sexual partners but that they should lie about the fact
("act as if your boyfriend was the only one").
The opposite occurs with male sexuality. Throughout the
years, the expectation has been for men to have many part-
ners, and this expectation is presented as something that is
valued by society and comprises a central ingredient of
masculinity:
1965: "A loyal husband is considered a silly man"
1995: "He says that he already had sex with more than
50 girls"
Another area of continuity includes the conceptualiza-
tion of female sexuality as inherently affective, or rather
the notion that it is difficult for women to detach sex from
love, while male sexuality is characterized by a "physiolog-
ical" need. In addition, men are presented as less worried
about finding a loving relationship and instead as actively
avoiding it.
1970: "She wants to keep herself so that she may
give herself as a gift to a true and complete love";
"The woman doesn't understand the urgency of her
husband's needs . . . "
1995: "`I want to make love to you' is a sentence
commonly used by men when they aren't actually
thinking of love"; "That `monster' called commit-
ment makes me sick and gives me shivers down my
spine."
c. Discursive differences according to the magazine
profile
In the magazines we analyzed during the first years
before the revolution, there were no differences between
publication profiles. A probable explanation resides in the
hegemonic political regime, which is characterized by cen-
sorship mechanisms, a marked ideology around the theme of
"family values" and the closed environment of Portugal
regarding the significant social and cultural changes of the
1960s and 1970s worldwide.
The present discourse is much more heterogeneous and
diverse, and it is possible to identify discursive differences
between publication profiles, these differences being stimu-
lated by this ideological diversity and by a bigger specializa-
tion of the mass media industry.
Female adolescents' magazines
Female adolescents' magazines are, by far, the ones in
which the topic of sexuality is most prevalent. As in other
studies (e.g., Magalhães, 2011; McRobbie, 1996; Mota-
Ribeiro, 2005), it is possible to observe the conflict arising
from plural and contradictory notions of sexuality (e.g., the
ideas that girls are sexually active and must take the first
step toward intimacy co-occur with concerns about virginity
and the alleged need for girls to hide their previous sexual
experiences). The focus of many articles is on the girl's deci-
sion to initiate sexual activities, which is addressed through
an instructional approach marked by numerous pieces of
advice (e.g., choose a loving partner, be comfortable with
your body, do not rush into a relationship).
In these publications, sex is conceptualized as a technique
or "ability," something that can be learned and taught. Girls
are given clear instructions about sex, assuming that they do
not have information from other sources (friends, school,
family). However, girls are told to instruct their boyfriends
about how boys should act with them.
Another common theme found in these magazines is the
notion that sexuality is placed on the affective/emotional
realm of experience. Sexuality is linked with a long-lasting
relationship, and sex is presented as something special,
associated with feelings of love, confidence, and respect.
This type of language suggests that love is the most appro-
priate or most desirable context for sex. This suggestion
does not mean that casual sex is not possible, but that it is a
less desirable one, one that girls need to differentiate from
"special" sex. Furthermore, casual sex can create problems
that girls have the responsibility to manage effectively.
Romantic love is, in fact, presented in teen magazines as an
ideal to which girls should aspire in their daily lives and use
to make decisions during difficult situations (infidelity,
fights) with their boyfriends, especially regarding the deci-
sion on whether to engage in sex.
Finally, it is important to emphasize that while teenagers'
magazines tend to focus on sexuality and sexual initiation,
their actual discussions of safe sex are quite scarce, and the
emphasis on sexuality overshadows other important areas of
teenagers' lives (e.g., school, family, friends).
Women's versus men's magazines
During the last few years, it is obvious that women's and
men's magazines marketed for an affluent audience focus
more on the analysis of gender differences. Both magazines
8 SAGE Open
claim that these differences are explained by cultural and
biological factors but still conceptualize female sexuality as
inherently affective and describe male sexuality as a physi-
ological function.
Double standards regarding sexuality also persist: Having
many sexual experiences and partners is presented as legiti-
mate and positive for men, whereas women must restrict
their sexual experiences to fewer relations with romantic
meaning:
Men's magazine: "What do males and females search
for? Males: sex! They keep improving their tech-
nique without scruples; Females: an ideal partner . .
. sex is important but only if there is commitment"
Women's magazine: "Because men usually desire
sexual relations earlier than women do, they will
sometimes insist with them or pressure them for
sex"; "Women want a relationship in romantic
terms."
Both publication profiles associate sexual initiative/
performance with masculinity, conferring an active role to
men, while assigning a receptive/passive role to women
("Most men are ready for immediate sexual relations";
"Women are conditioned to wait, no matter how they feel
towards the subject").
Despite this common focus in both publication profiles,
we also found specificities that are exclusive to each maga-
zine. One of those unique aspects is that the discourse on the
so-called "sexual ambiguity of women" appears only in
women's magazines, formulated in a way that makes women
responsible for clearly expressing their preferences to avoid
male misinterpretation and hurting their partner's feelings:
"Given the different expectations, perhaps it is better
for a woman to declare her intentions to him earlier--
before they go to his house, for example, or before
they go beyond the kissing phase. Tell him that you
like him, but that you aren't ready for more."
However, the men's magazine distinguishes itself by a
negative portrayal of women and their sexuality, either
describing it as a means women use to achieve control and
power in relationships ("Women can be controlling of men.
It is as if women told us, `if you do what I want, I'll go to bed
with you'") or pointing out women's sexual inhibitions
("Women hide, even from themselves, their desires and sex-
ual fantasies").
The reference to violent sexual practices is also exclusive
to this magazine profile, while stressing the "make believe"
and "controlled" character of these behaviors, and presenting
them in an educational tone ("Before beginning, agree on a
"word of safety" for the other to always know when to stop.
The word no can be an integral part of the fantasy. For that,
you need to certify that the password is something totally out
of the context").
Discussion
Media discourse on sexuality underwent great transforma-
tions throughout the years included in our analysis, both in
its frequency and in its content. In global terms, a discursive
inversion seems to have happened. The fascist era was char-
acterized by sexual repression, negative connotations of sex,
and its restriction to the marriage realm, whereas the present
time is characterized by the proliferation of discourses about
sex, both romanticized/idealized and "taught" as if it were a
technique.
With regard to the fascist era, we cannot forget the politi-
cal regime of the "Estado Novo": It was an authoritarian,
conservative, nationalist, and corporate regime, fascist-
inspired, Catholic and very traditionalist, which prevailed in
Portugal under the Second Republic (1933-1974; Braga da
Cruz, 1982). The regime has created its own state structure
and repressive apparatus (PIDE [Polícia Internacional e de
Defesa do Estado], penal colony for political prisoners, etc.).
It was a police state that relied on censorship, propaganda,
paramilitary organizations (Portuguese Legion), juvenile
organizations (Portuguese Youth), the cult of the leader, and
the Catholic Church (Pimentel, 2000).
Therefore, the absence of female sexuality in publications
until 1975 and the extreme suppression/annulation of women
(viewed as inferior, devoted to her husband and children, and
pure and chaste like the Virgin Mary until their marriage)
have to be understood under the ideology of the "Estado
Novo": (a) with a Catholic ideology, there was an alliance
between the state and the Catholic Church (Braga da Cruz,
1982); (b) because of the political propaganda and censor-
ship of periodicals, radio, and television, the state controlled
the content of every publication in the country to "protect"
its ideology defending "the moral and good behaviors"
(Braga da Cruz, 1982; Pimentel, 2000); (c) the state relied on
youth organizations (Portuguese Youth) to teach young peo-
ple the ideology advocated by the regime and teach them to
obey and respect the leader and the church (Pimentel, 2000);
and (d) the educational system was controlled by the regime
(a nationalist and ideological education) and focuses on the
exaltation of national values (e.g., past history, the great
Portuguese Colonial Empire, religion, tradition, customs,
service to the country, human solidarity from a Christian per-
spective, the attachment to the land and family, etc.) and
focuses on teaching and disseminating the state and catholic
ideology (Pimentel, 2000).
Thus, in this context, sexuality was conceptualized as
something negative and prohibited for women. On the con-
trary, sexuality was permitted and encouraged in men, and
society distinguished between women who marry (pure and
chaste) and women who have fun.
Conde Dias et al. 9
With regard to the current situation, sexual satisfaction
is now conceptualized as a central aspect in the construc-
tion of one's identity, being construed as both a woman's
goal and duty.
Although this conceptualization seems to confirm the idea
that the present era is characterized by sexual "liberation"
(e.g., Giddens, 1992; Gill, 2008; Jackson & Vares, 2011;
Johnson et al., 2001; McRobbie, 2009), the pervasiveness of
the social regulation of sexuality is also quite evident; it was
a regulation that changed from repression and moral censure
(in the years of the fascist regime), to a form of regulation (in
the democratic years) that operates through the internalized
control of women and organized around ideals of health, sat-
isfaction, and self-esteem, as noted by Foucault (1976). This
analysis is reinforced by the numerous ambiguities and con-
tradictions that permeate this discourse, again consistent with
what other studies have proven (Cancian & Gordon, 1988;
Jackson & Scott, 2004; Magalhães, 2011; McRobbie, 1996):
There is tension between describing women as more "natu-
rally" reserved and the prescriptions to be "more active";
there is conflict between the social censure of women's pro-
miscuity and the construction gender equality as the norm;
there is a contradiction between viewing adolescents who
have several sexual partners as acceptable and suggesting that
they not reveal that to their boyfriend. Furthermore, success
in love/sexual relationships is still construed as being a wom-
an's responsibility, linked to her ability to regulate herself and
the other person, to make good decisions, and to choose the
"right" way to behave. This finding reinforces the idea that,
while sex is not an interdict anymore, it did not become "free"
or "liberated." As Foucault emphasized, the proliferation of
discourses on sex that we observe in today's magazines con-
stitutes an arena for an even more complex regulation of sex-
uality: a territory of prescriptions, techniques, and careful
choices that continue to separate "good" from "bad" women.
Within this ambiguous framework, it seems important to
highlight the recurrent emphasis on the supposed difficulty
of women in separating sex from affect. The romantic dis-
course on the "specialness" of sex helps to reinforce this
idea: For women, sex is represented as a way to share and to
love, and it is this love/affect that makes women's sexual
practices "special" and "positive." This romanticization of
sex appears to constitute a discursive mechanism to reduce
the tension between traditional and modern discourses on
women's sexuality.
This discourse has a prescriptive nature, but it is not for-
mulated in an authoritarian voice; the imperatives that char-
acterized the prerevolutionary years are currently substituted
by a tolerant and educational discourse, which establishes
preferences within a framework that recognizes some
variety of sexual practices and relational contexts. Women
are, therefore, encouraged to experience their sexuality in a
loving/long-term relationship (although casual/short-term
relationships are accepted); exclusivity and monogamy are
presented as the ideal (despite recognizing the possibility of
breaking-up, infidelity, and serial relationships); and the
decision to engage in sex, especially for the first time, is
characterized as crucial and requires certainty and careful
reasoning.
In this process, the discourse directed at female adoles-
cents merits particular attention, because it is in this publica-
tion profile that sexual concerns are more evident, as has been
found in other studies (e.g., Gavey & McPhilips, 1999;
Jackson, 2001, 2005; McRobbie, 1996; Vares et al., 2011). It
is also important to study this discourse because these maga-
zines are directed at an age group for which the social regula-
tion of sexuality becomes more evident than ever and the
construction of female sexual subjectivity is potentially con-
solidated. Many authors indicate the importance of the mass
media in this process (Carpenter, 1998; Gill, 2010; Jackson,
2005; McRobbie, 1996, 2009; Pierce, 1990). Teenagers'mag-
azines symbolize an important way to produce, define, and
reinforce ideals regarding how an adolescent female and an
adult woman should behave sexually.
This trend clearly relates to the focus on girls'decisions to
initiate sexual life. As mentioned previously regarding maga-
zines'discussions of female sexuality, the permanent associa-
tion between sex and affect is also stressed in adolescent
magazines, placing love as the appropriate or more desirable
context for sex, as though love were the "excuse" to engage
in sex without losing self and social respect. We considered
that this speech constitutes an attempt to reconcile or dimin-
ish the tension between traditional visions of female adoles-
cent sexuality (virginity as a value, fear of social censure) and
the supposed sexual "freedom" of the present time.
Regarding the comparison of magazine profiles by gender,
it is clear that gender differences are portrayed with essential-
ism, as something stable, enduring, and internal (caused by
biological constitution or by the internalization of social roles
and discourses). The same happens with the persistence of
double standards of sexuality, namely, through traditional
notions of male activity and sexual dominance and female
passiveness and sexual reserve. These findings are consistent
with the findings in other studies (Crawford & Popp, 2003;
Duncombe & Marsden, 1993; Jackson & Scott, 2004;
Magalhães, 2011; Mota-Ribeiro, 2005).
In addition to this common focus in both publication pro-
files, the specificities of each magazine also reinforce tradi-
tional sexual roles. The discourse on women's sexual
ambiguity in women's magazines forces women to shoulder
the burden of managing their own and their partner's emo-
tions, while encouraged to attend to men's needs and provide
for their emotional comfort. This expectation resonates with
traditional notions that women are more competent than men
in the emotional realm and also with the idea that it is a wom-
an's responsibility to take care of other people's emotional
well-being. Many authors consider that these ideas, if taken
to an extreme, may make women feel pressured into having
10 SAGE Open
sex to keep the relationship alive and not hurt their partners,
and may even facilitate male sexual coercion (Jackson &
Scott, 2004; Jones, 2004).
Another important aspect of men's magazines is that they
convey a negative portrayal of women and their sexuality and
express the belief that women use sex as a form to exert con-
trol and power over men. This message has important impli-
cations: On one hand, it limits women's influence and power
to the sexual sphere, implying that their other capacities and
aptitudes are negligible; on the other hand, it propagates the
representation of men as those who withhold and control
resources, power, and decision-making in relationships. The
only way women may have access to that power is through
subtle persuasion techniques acquired by having sex.
Finally, another important characteristic of men's maga-
zines is the reference to violent sexual practices. While stress-
ing the "make believe" characteristic of these behaviors and
assuming an "educational" tone in their articles, this reference
may be interpreted as male concerns about the current social
challenges to male control and power and over dominant con-
structions of masculinity (Barker & Loewenstein, 1997; Fine,
Weis, Addelston, & Marusza, 1997; Hekma, 2006; Rogers,
2005; Totten, 2003).
This analysis showed that although there are significant
changes over the last 40 years in the way women's sexuality
is talked about in media discourse, including less repressive
discourse, many traditional gender expectations and sexual
differences between men and women persist. The social and
internalized control over women's sexuality is still pervasive,
although it is not exerted through such coercive means as
before. This change constitutes a clear example of Foucault's
(1976, 1987) conception of social changes during the last few
decades, moving away from a repressive form of control,
which was centered on the body, to a subtle, diffused, perva-
sive, and internalized pattern of control that is mostly exerted
through self-regulation and directed to the "soul."
On a more alarming note, we also found that some of
these discourses can legitimize female sexual submission or
even male sexual coercion over women. We hope that this
attempt at deconstructing media discourse has contributed to
a better understanding of the ways social control over female
sexuality has changed over time and how it functions during
the present day, while contributing to the reinforcement of
different and less prescriptive discourses on this theme. It is
our expectation that such discursive changes may contribute
to opening up new spaces, for both women and men, to con-
strue freer and preferential avenues of communication and
satisfaction in their intimate relationships.
