New York City using multiple data sources

Abstract
Background: Despite concerns about its health and social consequences, little is known about the prevalence of
illicit opioid use in New York City. Individuals who misuse heroin and prescription opioids are known to bear a
disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality. Service providers and public health authorities are challenged
to provide appropriate interventions in the absence of basic knowledge about the size and characteristics of this
population. While illicit drug users are underrepresented in population-based surveys, they may be identified in
multiple administrative data sources.
Methods: We analyzed large datasets tracking hospital inpatient and emergency room admissions as well as drug
treatment and detoxification services utilization. These were applied in combination with findings from a large
general population survey and administrative records tracking prescriptions, drug overdose deaths, and correctional
health services, to estimate the prevalence of heroin and non-medical prescription opioid use among New York
City residents in 2006. These data were further applied to a descriptive analysis of opioid users entering drug
treatment and hospital-based medical care.
Results: These data sources identified 126,681 cases of opioid use among New York City residents in 2006. After
applying adjustment scenarios to account for potential overlap between data sources, we estimated over 92,000
individual opioid users. By contrast, just 21,600 opioid users initiated drug treatment in 2006. Opioid users
represented 4 % of all individuals hospitalized, and over 44,000 hospitalizations during the calendar year.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that innovative approaches are needed to provide adequate services to this
sizeable population of opioid users. Given the observed high rates of hospital services utilization, greater integration
of drug services into medical settings could be one component of an effective approach to expanding both the
scope and reach of health interventions for this population.

Background
While there is great concern about the impact of illicit
drug use in New York City, particularly use of heroin and
prescription opioids, since the 1970s there have been few
rigorous efforts to estimate its prevalence [1]. In recent
decades we have seen significant changes in the culture
and patterns of drug use, including greater availability of
potent prescription opioids and decreasing rates of
intravenous drug use. What persists is the disproportion-
ate burden of morbidity and mortality borne by opioid
users, including chronic infectious diseases (hepatitis C,
HIV/AIDS) and premature death due to overdose and
accidents [2-7]. Service providers and government health
authorities are challenged to provide appropriate drug ser-
vices in the absence of basic knowledge about the size and
characteristics of their target population.
Three notable developments in recent years make this
an opportune time to revisit estimates of the prevalence of
opioid use. First, increasing rates of prescription opioid
misuse and related overdose deaths indicate a shift in drug
use patterns, demographics, and potential harms of use
[8-11]. Prescription opioid users may be poorly reached by

traditional drug treatment services, although treatment
admissions in New York State do display a steady increase
from this group over the past 15 years. Historically, re-
search on opioid use has largely focused on heroin-using
populations, with much less known about the treatment
needs and access to care issues experienced by prescrip-
tion opioid users [12].
A second event is the approval in 2002 of buprenor-
phine for treatment of opioid dependence, which offers
an exceptional opportunity for expansion of evidence-
based treatment. Buprenorphine can be prescribed by
physicians in general practice settings, and thus offers the
possibility of dramatically expanding access to treatment,
but is not currently being employed to its fullest poten-
tial [13,14]. A related third event is a newly increased
emphasis on integrating addiction treatment into non-
specialty medical settings such as primary care clinics.
This is exemplified in the current strategic plan issued by
the federal Office of National Drug Control Policy, which
emphasizes early identification of substance use disorders
and expansion of treatment through mainstream health-
care settings [15].
Population surveys, primarily the National Survey on
Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), are relied upon to assess
the prevalence of illicit drug use, but are believed to se-
verely underestimate `hardcore' drug use, including heroin
and injection drug use [16,17]. The survey does not in-
clude individuals who are incarcerated, institutionalized,
or street homeless; all populations with disproportionately
high prevalence of drug use [18]. It may also underesti-
mate drug use among those who do participate, due to
underreporting of stigmatized and illicit behavior by
respondents, despite efforts to counteract this with recent
changes in survey methodology [19]. As a result of these
constraints, the NSDUH is limited in its ability to inform
intelligent program design for opioid users.
Other data collected for administrative purposes and
public health surveillance contains information on the
health, demographic, and geographic characteristics of
opioid users, and captures populations excluded from
the NSDUH sample. While no single data source pro-
vides a comprehensive picture of illicit opioid use, each
provides information on a subset of users who have
developed social, psychological or physical problems as a
consequence of their use. Yet these data sources have
not previously been systematically applied to characterize
the prevalence of opioid use. We analyzed these data
with a goal of informing potential changes in drug ser-
vices that could accommodate those left out of the
current treatment system.
Methods
This descriptive analysis of the prevalence of opioid use
in New York City utilizes multiple data sources,
including administrative datasets recording hospital in-
patient and emergency room admissions, treatment and
detoxification services utilization, prescription records,
overdose deaths, and correctional health statistics, as
well as survey data from the NSDUH. Using data from
the most recent year (2006) for which complete data
were available for all sources, we analyzed these datasets
in combination to characterize the population of opioid
users who would be candidates for drug services. We
then compared them to the population entering drug
treatment programs to estimate the extent of the un-
treated opioid user population.
Definition of opioid use/users Opioid users are defined
as individuals using heroin or misusing prescription
opioids (taking prescription opioid medications outside
of a physician's care or other than as prescribed). Opioid
use is potentially, but not necessarily, concurrent with
the clinical diagnoses of opioid abuse or dependence.
While not all datasets allow a rigorous classification of
abuse or dependence, opioid users are identified in the
data by virtue of the health or treatment consequences
of their opioid abuse, dependence, or poisoning, and are
thus all potential candidates for drug services [20,21].
Case definition Cases were limited to unique indivi-
duals because our goal was to identify the size and char-
acteristics of the opioid user population rather than
service utilization. Cases were additionally limited to
residents of the five counties of New York City. Specific
definitions for identifying cases of opioid use varied by
dataset, and are described in Table 1.
Description of the datasets Datasets containing detailed
information on characteristics of the study population
were classified as `primary.' Those providing only general
information about the population of interest (i.e. fre-
quency of cases) were classified as `supplemental' datasets.
Primary datasets
Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System
(SPARCS) is an administrative reporting system of the
New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH) that
comprehensively records all hospital inpatient and out-
patient visits to New York State hospitals [22]. Access to
SPARCS data used in the current analysis was provided
by the NYS DOH. The inpatient data records hospital
discharges, while the outpatient data records emergency
department (ED) and ambulatory surgery admissions.
SPARCS data provides patient-level detail on demo-
graphic characteristics; medical procedures and princi-
pal, secondary and admitting diagnoses as classified by

v The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) includes a series of questions to assess the prevalence of substance use disorders (i.e., dependence on or abuse of a substance) in the past 12 months. These
questions are used to classify persons as dependent on or abusing specific substances based on criteria specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric
Association [APA], 1994). [http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/NSDUH/2k9NSDUH/2k9Results.htm#Ch7].

viii The DOHMH Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Use Prevention, Care and Treatment conducted an additional in-depth review of Medical Examiner records to define in further detail the substances involved and
circumstances of overdose death. This data was previously reported (NYC DOHMH Vital Signs, February, 2010); only data from calendar year 2006 data was included in our analysis. Paone D, Heller D, Olson C, Kerker B.

charges for each treatment episode. Cases included in
our analysis were drawn from the hospital discharge and
ED admissions data. The ICD-9 diagnostic codes used to
define `opioid use' cases are listed in Table 1.
Client Data System (CDS) is an administrative data set
of the New York State Office of Alcoholism and Sub-
stance Abuse Services (OASAS) of the NYS DOH, which
provided the data for this study. The CDS tracks all
admissions to licensed providers of medical detoxifica-
tion and substance abuse treatment services, and records
patient-level demographics and provides detailed infor-
mation about recent substance use behaviors. Data is
collected from each patient at the time of admission,
and all information is based on client self-report. Cases
were drawn from both the detoxification and substance
abuse treatment program datasets, and limited to indivi-
duals reporting one or more opioids as a primary, sec-
ondary or tertiary drug of abuse. We did not distinguish
between individuals who entered drug treatment volun-
tarily and those who were mandated to treatment by the
criminal justice system through alternative to incarcer-
ation and similar programs.
Supplemental datasets
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) is an
annual household survey conducted by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).
It is the primary source of information on the prevalence
and patterns of substance use in the general population,
age 12 and older [23]. Information collected includes
patterns and severity of lifetime, past year and current
drug use. Population prevalence is estimated from the
survey sample using established NSDUH methodology
[24]. Substate-level data on opioid use is not published,
but was obtained from SAMHSA for New York City
(NSDUH region A) by the NYC DOHMH (Bureau of
Alcohol and Drug Use Prevention, Care and Treatment),
which provided the data for this analysis. Cases included
were limited to individuals classified as having abuse or
dependence on heroin or prescription opioids.
The Bureau of Correctional Health Services in the
NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC
DOHMH) records on-site health services received by
New York City jail inmates, including the number re-
ceiving methadone for detoxification or maintenance
treatment of opioid dependence during the period of in-
carceration. Jail rather than prison inmates are included
in this analysis because of their shorter length of stay.
With an average length of stay of just 37 days [25], most
of these inmates are expected to rejoin the community
within the calendar year, thus adding to the population
of New York City opioid users eligible for drug services.
Data used in this study were provided by Correctional
Health Services and do not allow identification of unique
individuals.
The Bureau of Vital Statistics in the NYC DOHMH
maintains records of unintentional drug overdose deaths.
The Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Use Prevention, Care
and Treatment conducted an additional review of Med-
ical Examiner records for these cases to detail the sub-
stances involved and circumstances of overdose death.
These publicly available overdose data were used in our
analysis [6].
Prescription records are collected by the NYS DOH for
all controlled substances prescribed and dispensed in
New York State, including buprenorphine. Oral bupre-
norphine is indicated exclusively for treatment of opioid
dependence, and may be prescribed by qualified physi-
cians for maintenance or detoxification treatment. Data
is collected on the total number of buprenorphine pre-
scriptions filled, as well as the number of individuals fill-
ing a buprenorphine prescription for the first time. Data
on buprenorphine prescriptions dispensed in New York
City is regularly provided to the NYC DOHMH, Bureau
of Alcohol and Drug Use Prevention, Care and Treat-
ment, and the Bureau Assistant Commissioner (author
DH) provided summary statistics for the current ana-
lysis. Buprenorphine treatment entrants were defined as
those individuals filling a buprenorphine prescription in
2006 who did not fill a buprenorphine prescription
within New York City in the prior three years.
Notably, we did not use data from the Drug Abuse
Warning Network (DAWN). DAWN is a federal surveil-
lance system tracking substance use-related ED visits
based on chart reviews rather than ICD-9 codes, and is
often applied to assessments of the health burden of illicit
drug use at the local and national level [26]. We chose to
use SPARCS instead of DAWN to track emergency de-
partment admissions in our analysis because DAWN data
reflects a rate projection based on a sample of patient vis-
its rather than an inclusive count of all ED admissions.
Analysis
Three subpopulations of opioid users were defined. The
general population (G) refers to opioid users identified
through population health and criminal justice data.
Drug services entrants (D) are those entering inpatient
detoxification or drug treatment programs, or filling
their first buprenorphine prescription. Medical services
recipients (M) are those identified in the SPARCS data-
sets from inpatient hospitalizations (based on hospital
discharge data) or emergency room admissions.
Estimation of subpopulations
We calculated the number of opioid users identified
within each dataset according to the case definitions
specified in Table 1. Within the primary datasets, cases
McNeely et al. BMC Public Health 2012, 12:443 Page 5 of 12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/12/443
were limited to unique individuals. In the SPARCS data,
this was accomplished by creating a unique identifier
based on SPARCS UPID, (an anonymous identifier pro-
vided in the datasets), in combination with date of birth
and sex. In the CDS data, individuals were identified
using a unique identifier constructed from sex, date of
birth, last four digits of social security number, and first
two characters of last name. To eliminate duplication,
cases were further restricted to the first admission of the
calendar year for each individual, both within and be-
tween the detoxification and substance abuse treatment
program datasets. In the supplemental datasets, NSDUH
methodology provided prevalence estimates [24]. Over-
dose deaths are unique by definition. The number of
individuals receiving buprenorphine is tracked by the
NYS DOH utilizing identifying information included on
each filled prescription. We were not able to limit the
correctional health services data to unique individuals.
The total number of individual opioid users captured
in each subpopulation was then estimated. While we
were able to limit cases within most datasets to unique
individuals, we were not able to track individuals be-
tween the various data sources. This introduced the pos-
sibility of over-counting individuals who appeared in
more than one data source. For example, an individual
who had both an emergency room visit for medical rea-
sons and a drug treatment program admission in 2006
may have been counted twice in our analysis, because
one admission would be captured in the SPARCS data,
and the other in the CDS. To account for this we incor-
porated `expansive' and `restrictive' estimates of the
population size, and examined varying degrees of overlap
between the datasets defining our subpopulations.
In estimating the `general population' (G) of opioid
users, the expansive estimate assumed no overlap be-
tween NSDUH and the corrections population or over-
dose decedents. The most restrictive estimate assumed
that individuals identified through corrections or over-
dose deaths were already accounted for by the NSDUH
sampling strategy and estimation method, even though
corrections populations are not surveyed directly. In the
`drug services population' (D), the CDS dataset identified
unique individuals admitted to either drug treatment or
medical detoxification services. The only potential dupli-
cation of drug services recipients would thus be through
double counting of those who received a prescription for
buprenorphine in addition to detoxification or drug
treatment services. Therefore, the more expansive esti-
mate assumed that individuals initiating buprenorphine
treatment and those entering detoxification or drug
treatment services were distinct, whereas the more re-
strictive estimate assumed that buprenorphine recipients
were already counted among the drug treatment
admissions.
For the `medical services' (M) population, any indivi-
duals who were hospitalized for drug detoxification or re-
habilitation procedure(s) were identified using
International Classification of Infectious Diseases, 9th revi-
sion (ICD-9) diagnostic codes (ICD-9 codes 9461Â­9).
These cases were removed from the analysis of the med-
ical services population, because detoxification and re-
habilitation admissions are comprehensively recorded in
the CDS data. This step eliminated duplication of indivi-
duals appearing in both the CDS and SPARCS datasets.
Unique individuals were identified within and across the
SPARCS inpatient and outpatient data using our unique
identifier.
Estimation of the total opioid user population
Adding the combined totals from each subpopulation
provided an expansive and a restrictive unadjusted esti-
mate of the opioid user population. However, combining
these subpopulations introduced further potential for
duplication of individuals who may appear in more than
one group. To account for this, we examined two sce-
narios describing degrees of overlap between our gen-
eral, medical services, and drug services subpopulations.
The expansive estimate assumed that there was no
overlap between subpopulations. While some opioid
users likely appear in more than one subpopulation, this
approach may compensate for the fact that opioid users
are a hidden population that is likely to be undercounted
in all datasets [27,28]. The restrictive estimate assumed
that the general population estimate accurately identifies
all opioid users, thus eliminating the need to additionally
include those individuals presenting for medical and
drug services. The midpoint between the expansive and
restrictive estimates was considered our best estimate of
the total opioid user population.
Estimation of treatment entrants
We identified two subpopulations to formulate an esti-
mate of the number of opioid users entering drug treat-
ment in 2006. The first subpopulation came from the
CDS data, which identifies those individuals citing opi-
oid(s) as a primary, secondary, or tertiary drug of abuse
upon entry to a treatment program. In this analysis of
drug treatment entrants, individuals admitted for detoxi-
fication only were excluded, unless they also entered a
treatment program in 2006. The second subpopulation
was identified through buprenorphine prescription
records. To account for potential double-counting of
individuals receiving buprenorphine who may have also
attended a drug treatment program, we calculated both
expansive and restrictive estimates of the number of
treatment entrants. The midpoint of the expansive and
restrictive estimates was used as our estimate of the total
number of treatment entrants.

Description of opioid users entering drug services and
hospital-based medical services
After applying the specified case definitions to restrict
the dataset to individual opioid users, we used descrip-
tive statistics to examine the demographic and geo-
graphic characteristics of cases identified in the CDS
(drug services) and SPARCS (hospital-based medical ser-
vices) data. County of residence was identified by the
individual's home zip code. The drug services data
included individuals admitted to drug treatment, detoxi-
fication services, or both during 2006. The hospital ser-
vices data was divided into emergency room (ER) and
inpatient admissions. In this descriptive analysis, opioid
users who had hospitalizations for detoxification or re-
habilitation were included in the hospital inpatient data,
(along with those hospitalized for medical reasons), in
order to provide a more comprehensive picture of the
opioid user population accessing hospital-based acute
medical care. This is in contrast to the prevalence esti-
mations, in which individuals admitted for detoxification
or rehabilitation were excluded from the SPARCS data
to avoid duplication.
Results
These data sources identified 126,681 cases of opioid use
among New York City residents in 2006 (Table 2). Based
on our case definitions, all of these opioid users have
attributes consistent with opioid abuse, dependence, or
poisoning, and would thus qualify for services to address
their substance use [20,21].
Opioid users were categorized into three subpopula-
tions, of which the general population (G) was the lar-
gest, with a midpoint estimate of 69,463 individuals. The
majority were identified from the NSDUH survey. The
607 unintentional opioid poisoning overdose decedents
represented 0.9 % of this subpopulation. Entrants to drug
services (D) were the second largest subpopulation, with
an estimated 28,378 individuals. Ten percent (2,880) of
this group received a prescription for buprenorphine.
Medical service recipients (M) were the smallest of our
three subpopulations, but still represented an estimated
17,618 opioid users.
Adding the midpoint estimations for our three subpo-
pulations produced an expansive estimate of 115,459
opioid users (Figure 1). The restrictive estimate, which
assumed that all opioid users were represented in the
general population estimate, lowered the estimation to
69,463. An estimated 21,600 entered drug treatment, ei-
ther by enrolling in a substance abuse treatment pro-
gram or initiating treatment with buprenorphine.
Characteristics of opioid users identified in the drug
services versus hospital-based medical services data are
shown in Table 3. Opioid users had a mean age of
40 years or greater, with hospital inpatients being consid-
erably older. The majority were male, though there was
greater representation of females in the hospitalized
population than in drug treatment programs. The Bronx
was the county with both the greatest number and pro-
portion of opioid users. Bronx residents were also well
represented in the drug services population, with a rate
of 814 admissions per 100,000 adults.

We found that opioid users had high rates of acute care
hospital utilization. Overall, they represented 4.1 % of all
individuals hospitalized and 0.7 % of all individuals admit-
ted to the emergency room in 2006. In total, opioid users
had 44,154 hospitalizations, 20,959 (47 %) of which were
for medical reasons (i.e. not for detoxification or rehabili-
tation). They incurred an additional 10,053 emergency
room visits that did not result in hospitalization (data not
shown).
Discussion
Our analysis sought to provide a rigorous estimation of
the opioid user population by grounding prevalence esti-
mates in a range of datasets that are not often applied to
this question. Although even this diversified approach
may not capture the full scope of opioid use, it does
allow construction of a more comprehensive picture of
opioid users in New York City, including prevalence,
service utilization, and demographic characteristics.
There is clearly a need for expanded drug services for
opioid users in New York City. Even using our most re-
strictive estimations, there were over 69,000 opioid users
residing in New York City in 2006. While over 21,000
individual opioid users did initiate treatment, this repre-
sents a small fraction of the identified opioid user popu-
lation. Moreover, because close to half of treatment
admissions are mandated each year in New York City,
including one-third by criminal justice authorities (i.e.
courts, probation, parole), one can assume a consider-
able portion of this fraction did not initiate treatment
voluntarily.
The current drug treatment system alone cannot be
relied upon to accommodate the needs of this popula-
tion. Though maintenance treatment with an opioid
agonist medication, (methadone or buprenorphine), is
the best evidence-based treatment strategy for opioid de-
pendence [29], not all of the opioid users identified here
would necessarily qualify for, or accept, medication
assisted treatment. Furthermore, accommodating these
individuals within the existing substance abuse treat-
ment system would involve doubling the capacity of
New York City opiate agonist treatment programs,
which currently serve approximately 37,500 patients
[14]. Buprenorphine treatment in general medical set-
tings provides an alternative means of treatment expan-
sion, but slow uptake among physicians has thus far
limited its reach.
While many opioid users would undoubtedly benefit
from traditional drug treatment services, the availability
of treatment slots is not the only barrier to engaging
them in effective evidence-based care. Although these
data sources largely capture the negative sequelae of opi-
oid use (health problems, incarceration) that are more
prominent among those with active substance use disor-
ders, even non-dependent and early-stage users are vul-
nerable to drug-related problems, and may also have
been identified here. Similarly, these data may include
opioid users that were already enrolled in drug treat-
ment, but nonetheless experienced problems related to
drug use. Some opioid users could be served by less in-
tensive treatment interventions, such as brief interven-
tions or pharmacotherapy, provided in healthcare or

community settings that are not traditionally considered
part of the drug treatment system [30,31]. Many would
benefit from harm reduction approaches to prevent the
negative consequences of opioid use. A greater diversity,
as well as a greater number, of treatment providers would
thus be needed to deliver care to the full range of opioid
users identified here. Public health authorities could
apply this data to assess and orient the structural config-
uration of existing treatment services, and to expand en-
gagement, access points, service types and modalities,
and venues to better reach the sizeable under-served opi-
oid user population.
Our approach does have a number of limitations. Most
notably, we were unable to match individual opioid users
across data sources. Capture-recapture analysis, which re-
lies on identifying unique individuals across multiple data-
sets, can potentially improve the accuracy of prevalence
estimation, and has been applied in municipalities outside
the US to estimate populations of illicit drug users [32-
35]. We chose not to use this approach because accessing
fully identified individual-level data from multiple data
sources was not feasible at the time of this analysis. Simi-
larly, although it would be desirable to perform a validity
check of the final estimates using an alternate method, this
was beyond the scope of the present study. However, our
findings do have face validity in light of prior estimates of
the New York City opioid user population [1,13].
Our estimation of the medical services population re-
lied on hospital data from inpatient and emergency
room presentations, and did not capture individuals who
utilized only ambulatory care services. Analysis of insur-
ance claims data could contribute that information, but
was not accessible for this analysis. Our data also fail to
capture services provided within the Veteran's Adminis-
tration (VA) system.
There are several limitations inherent to the datasets
themselves. Substance use is often not identified in med-
ical settings [36-39] and substance use and other mental
health diagnoses are poorly captured by medical admin-
istrative data [40-44]. Additionally, none of the datasets
that rely on service utilization (drug treatment, detoxifi-
cation, or hospital inpatient services) capture those with
less problematic opioid use, who have not experienced
the health and social sequelae of addiction that often
drive users to seek care. As a result, we relied on the
NSDUH for the general population estimation of opioid
use, despite its known limitations [16,17]. Finally, our
analysis is restricted to a single year-long period (2006),
and thus does not capture trends in opioid use over
time. This may be a particularly significant limitation
with respect to prescription opioid use, which has been
rising rapidly nationwide [9-11].
Despite these limitations, our study contributes to the
understanding of the prevalence of opioid use in New
York City by rigorously defining the dimensions and
characteristics of the opioid user population. More
sophisticated epidemiologic analyses of these multiple
datasets, including capture-recapture and multiplier
methods, could provide a more accurate estimate of the
hidden population of opioid users who do not appear in
any existing data sources. Our goal here was to take a
first step toward that end by defining the number and
range of individuals who met our case definition of
problematic opioid use in health-related datasets.
Conclusion
The health and social impact of opioid use is well
recognized, but drug services have yet to adapt and ex-
pand to meet the needs of New York City's sizeable out
of treatment opioid user population. By providing a
more comprehensive view of the opioid user popula-
tion, our analysis could inform policy changes at the
municipal and state level that would foster a broader
spectrum of services for opioid users, and greater diver-
sity of settings in which drug services are provided.
Efforts to reach this population could include provision
of treatment and early intervention outside of specialized
drug treatment programs, through greater involvement
of the mainstream health care system. Though a minority
of opioid users entered drug treatment in 2006, our ana-
lysis reveals that their contact with other aspects of the
health system is routine. Many are utilizing hospital-
based care, and many more are likely seen in ambulatory
care settings, visits to which were not captured here.
This presents an opportunity to expand both the scope
and reach of drug services. Office-based treatment with
buprenorphine, for example, offers the opportunity to
reach individuals who do not typically seek care at sub-
stance abuse treatment programs. Greater adoption of
screening and brief intervention (SBI) models is another
potential avenue for expanding services to the large sub-
stance using population that is not actively seeking drug
treatment.
These changes will occur only with strong public health
leadership and targeted research that informs and sup-
ports changes within the complex systems of health care
and drug treatment services. Buprenorphine's potential
has yet to be fully realized, in New York City and through-
out the U.S., due to practitioner- and systems-level bar-
riers [45-47]. There are important questions about how
best to implement SBI, and its effectiveness for individuals
with opioid abuse or dependence, but research can pro-
vide better models for identifying and engaging this popu-
lation in health care settings [48]. Successful early
intervention with these users could potentially prevent de-
velopment of the severe sequelae of untreated opioid use
disorders, including the health and social consequences
