Introduction
Primary aldosteronism (PA), characterized by autonomous
overproduction of aldosterone and suppression of plasma
renin activity (PRA), is the most common curable endocrine
cause of secondary arterial hypertension.1 The prevalence of
PA is around 4.3%­11.2% in hypertensive patients.1,2
Patients with PA had higher risk for cardiovascular disease,
metabolic dysfunction and renal dysfunction.3­6
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated deriv-
ative, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), are the
most abundant steroids produced by adrenal glands in pri-
mates.7 Both are stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hor-
mone (ACTH) and are secreted from zona reticularis.8
DHEA/DHEA-S are precursors for sex hormones and are
implicated to be involved in several aging processes, such
as metabolic disease, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclero-
sis, cognitive dysfunction, decreased muscle strength, and
several immune disorders including asthma.9­14 The serum
concentration of DHEA/DHEA-S reaches a peak at age 20
to 30 years, and then gradually decreases.15 Serum DHEA-S
concentrations can reflect the active DHEA pool in most
conditions.16 Clinically, serum DHEA-S concentration is
more frequently measured as it has a longer half-life and is
more stable than DHEA.17
In subjects with cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas,
serum DHEA-S concentrations are lower, which may result
from suppressed ACTH.18­23 In subjects with adrenal
malignancies such as androgen-secreting carcinomas,
serum DHEA-S concentrations are higher.23 However,
serum DHEA-S concentration in subjects with PA remains
Serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate
concentration is lower in women with
primary aldosteronism

Abstract
Objective: The objective of this article is to measure serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) concentration
in both genders with primary aldosteronism (PA).
Materials and methods: The study enrolled 78 subjects with normal controls, 46 subjects with essential hypertension
and 85 subjects with PA from October 2007 to June 2011. Subjects with PA were divided into three subtype groups:
aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), bilateral idiopathic hyperplasia (IHA) and PA with negative imaging findings.
Results: Women with PA (n = 49) had lower serum DHEA-S levels compared with normal controls and subjects with
essential hypertension (p < 0.01). In subtype analysis, only female APAs had lower serum DHEA-S levels (p < 0.01 com-
pared with normal controls, p < 0.01 compared with subjects with essential hypertension). In APA, a significant correla-
tion between tumor size and serum DHEA-S was found in women (p < 0.01).
Conclusion: Our data suggested that serum DHEA-S levels are lower in women with PA. In subtype groups, only
women with APA had lower serum DHEA-S. There was no significant difference between subjects with bilateral essential
hyperplasia, PA with negative imaging findings, normal controls and subjects with essential hypertension in both genders.
The serum DHEA-S level is negatively correlated with the size of APA.

unclear. Recently, cytochrome P-450 carbon 17-hydroxy
lase/17,20-lyse (CYP17), an enzyme involved in DHEA/
DHEA-S syntheses, has been shown to be down-regulated
in subjects with PA.24 The mRNA and protein expression of
CYP17 is even lower in subjects with APA than with nodu-
lar hyperplasia. It is possible that subjects with PA may
have lower serum DHEA-S concentrations.
In the present study, we investigated the serum DHEA-S
in subjects with PA including APA and bilateral idiopathic
hyperplasia (IHA), as well as in subjects with essential
hypertension and normal controls. We explored the deter-
minant of serum DHEA-S concentrations in these subjects
and studied whether there were any gender differences.
Materials and methods
Subjects
This study enrolled 85 patients (36 men and 49 women)
diagnosed with PA from October 2007 to June 2011. All
patientswereregisteredintheTaiwanPrimaryAldosteronism
Investigation (TAIPAI) database.25 All subjects with PA
were confirmed with evidence of autonomous excess of
aldosterone production (aldosterone renin ratio > 35) and
saline infusion suppression tests (post-saline loading plasma
aldosterone concentration (PAC) > 10 ng/dl).26,27 In addi-
tion, another 46 patients (28 and 18 women) with essential
hypertension and 78 healthy people (37 men and 41 women)
were enrolled as control groups. Essential hypertension was
diagnosed by exclusion according to clinical and biochemi-
cal investigations. The healthy people were recruited in our
health examination center without any major diseases. The
study was approved by the institutional review board of
National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan (No.
201103070RC and No. 201110008RB). All subjects gave
informed consent.
Diagnosis of APA, IHA and PA with negative
imaging findings
Among the 85 patients with PA, 44 patients received uni-
lateral adrenalectomy. APA was defined by evidence of
adenoma at computed tomography (CT) scan and pathol-
ogy-proved adenoma. IHA was defined on the basis of:
1) bilateral adrenal hyperplasia shown in CT scan or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 2) bilateral adrenal
lesions on 131I NP-59 scan, 3) no lateralization after
bilateral adrenal venous sampling (lateralization was
defined by a greater than four-fold difference in the
aldosterone/cortisol ratio between bilateral adrenal
veins) or 4) pathology reports if the patient received an
operation. Nine of the PA patients who had no imaging
abnormality and did not receive adrenal venous sam-
pling and operation were defined as PA with negative
imaging findings.
Measurements of serum total cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,
potassium, creatinine, PAC, PRA, DHEA-S
concentrations and tumor sizes of adenomas
Serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, potassium, and
creatinine were measured by an immunochemistry analyzer
(Beckman AU 2700, Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). PAC
was measured by commercial radioimmunoassay kits
(Aldosterone Maia Kit; Adaltis Italia, Bologna, Italy). PRA
was measured as the generation of angiotensin-I in vitro by
commercial radioimmunoassay kits (Cisbio, Bedford,
MA). Serum DHEA-S was measured by competitive
chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (Immulite/
Immulite 1000, Siemens, Berlin, Germany). For DHEA-S,
intra-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 6.8 to
9.5%, and inter-assay coefficients of variation ranged from
8.1% to 15%. For subjects with APA, we measured the
tumor sizes in CT or MRI.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) in
metric and S.I. units except aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR).
ARR was summarized as median and interquartile ranges.
Serum DHEA-S, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, PRA,
PAC, ARR, potassium, creatinine and tumor size were log-
arithmically transformed to approximate normal distribu-
tion in the analyses. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests,
Student's t tests, and Pearson's chi square tests were used to
identify the differences in various demographic and meta-
bolic characteristics among different groups. Bonferroni's
correction was applied for post-hoc comparison. Age-
adjusted DHEA-S concentrations were based on statistic
models composed of age and group. Linear predictions in
each group were calculated using mean value of age.
Pearson's correlation coefficients and linear regression
models were applied to analyze the relationship between
serum DHEA-S and adenoma size. A two-tailed p value
below 0.05 was considered significant. Stata/SE 11.0 for
Windows (StataCorp LP, Texas) was used for statistical
analyses.
Results
A total of 209 subjects, including 101 men and 108 women,
were included with a mean age of 45.3 ± 8.7 years (range
21­75 years). As shown in Table 1, subjects were divided
into groups of normal controls, essential hypertension and
PA. Each group included 78, 46 and 85 subjects, respec-
tively. Subjects with PA were older than those with essen-
tial hypertension, more obese than normal controls, had
higher blood pressure, higher PAC, lower PRA, higher
ARR, lower serum potassium and lower estimated glomer-
ular filtration rate (eGFR) than the other two groups.
Chen et al. 139
Subjects with PA showed a lower serum DHEA-S than the
other two groups (p <0.001). If we adjusted for age, sub-
jects with PA had lower serum DHEA-S than subjects with
essential hypertension (p = 0.013) and had borderline lower
serum DHEA-S than normal controls (p = 0.076). For fur-
ther analysis, we divided the subjects by gender. As shown
in Figure 1, after adjusting for age, women with PA (n = 49)
had lower serum DHEA-S compared with normal controls
and subjects with essential hypertension (p = 0.04 com-
pared with normal control, p = 0.0296 compared with
essential hypertension). However, serum DHEA-S levels in
men with PA (n = 36) were no different from subjects with
normal control or essential hypertension, after adjusting for
age (p = 0.74).
According to pathology reports, imaging findings and
bilateral adrenal venous sampling results, we further
divided the subjects with PA into three groups: APA, IHA
and PA with negative imaging findings. Clinical records of
these three groups are shown in Table 2. Subjects with
APA had lower potassium than subjects with IHA. There
was no difference in serum DHEA-S level among these
three groups (p = 0.59, p = 0.44 if adjusted for age). For
further analysis, we divided the subjects by gender.
However, there was no difference in serum DHEA-S level
among these three groups in both genders after adjusting
for age (p = 0.65 in men, p = 0.45 in women). We then
further compared serum DHEA-S concentrations of these
three groups with normal controls and those with essential
hypertension in both genders. We found that only women
with APA had significantly lower serum DHEA-S
concentrations than normal control subjects and those with
essential hypertension (p = 0.006 compared with normal
controls, p = 0.029 compared with those with essential
hypertension). As shown in Figure 2, after adjusting for
age, women with APA had lower serum DHEA-S concen-
trations than normal controls and those with essential
hypertension (p = 0.01 compared with normal control sub-
jects, p = 0.007 compared with subjects with essential
hypertension). In both genders, there were no significant
differences of serum DHEA-S concentrations in normal
control subjects, those with essential hypertension, IHA,
and PA with negative imaging findings.
As serum DHEA-S was lower in women with APA, we
analyzed the relationship among serum DHEA-S level and
tumor size, serum potassium, serum ARR and PAC for both
genders. We found a significant inverse correlation between
tumor size and serum DHEA-S level in women but not in
men (p = 0.009 vs. p = 0.86), as shown in Figure 3.Adjusting
for age, tumor size and serum DHEA-S level still showed a
borderline inverse relationship in women (p = 0.051) but
not in men (p = 0.82).
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that
subjects with PA had lower serum DHEA-S concentrations
than subjects with essential hypertension or normal control
women. In subtype analysis, only female APAs had lower
serum DHEA-S concentrations. In both genders, there were
no differences in serum DHEA-S concentrations among

normal control subjects and those with essential hyperten-
sion, IHA, and PA with NIF. In women with APA, serum
DHEA-S concentration was negatively correlated with size
of the adrenal tumor.
In 1996, Zsuzsa et al. reported low DHEA-S in two
pathology-confirmed adrenal adenomas with low plasma
renin activity.28 In 1997, Tóth et al. demonstrated that 17
out of 59 subjects with APA had low DHEA-S, but lacked
data for adrenal hyperplasia and different genders.29
Four enzymes are involved in the synthesis and regu-
lation of DHEA-S. CYP17, cytochrome b5 (CYB5) and
steroid sulfotransferase (SULT2A1) are enzymes for
synthesis. Three--hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
(HSD3B2) is an enzyme that can convert DHEA to
androstenedion, and its activity is inversely related to
DHEA-S concentration.30 In a previous study, CYP17
has been shown to be down-regulated in subjects with
APA and nodular hyperplasia.24 However, the expression
of HSD3B2, CYB5 and SULT2A1 in PA remains
unknown. The low CYP17 level in PA may explain our
findings.
Another interesting result of our study is that only
women with APA have significantly lower serum
DHEA-S concentrations compared with normal controls

and essential hypertension subjects. We failed to detect
any differences in the serum DHEA-S levels among
IHA, PA with negative imaging findings, normal con-
trol, and essential hypertension subjects in both gen-
ders. The result is partially consistent with the finding
that CYP17 expression is lower in APA than in nodular
hyperplasia reported by Cui et al.24 However, in that
study, the CYP17 expression in nodular hyperplasia is
still lower than in normal adrenal glands. In our study,
we could not find differences between the subjects with
IHA, normal controls, and those with essential hyper-
tension. There are three possible reasons. First, the clin-
ical definition of IHA is different from pathology-proved
nodular hyperplasia. Most of the patients with IHA did
not receive an operation.25 Second, the activities of
other enzymes such as CYB5, HSD3B2 and SULT2A1
are unknown in IHA, which may diminish the effect of
suppressed CYP17 expression in IHA.30 Third, the case
numbers of IHA by different genders are relative small.
The concentration of serum DHEA-S in different gen-
ders with IHA should be further explored with larger
sample sizes.
Tumor size of the APA is the only factor associated with
the level of serum DHEA-S in the present study. There is no
significant correlation between serum DHEA-S and PAC or
ARR. If we adjust for age, there still exists a borderline
significant relationship between serum DHEA-S level and
tumor size. The role of tumor size in APA is still
controversial.31,32 Karashima et al. have reported that
CYP17 is lower in the adjacent tissue of PA with adenomas
larger than 0.6 cm.33 Whether the activities of CYP17,
CYB5, HSD3B2 and SULT2A1 are in proportion to tumor
size in APA should be further studied.
Only in women, we found a significant correlation
between DHEA-S and tumor size of APA. The serum
DHEA-S level is higher in men after adulthood. In women,
adrenal glands are the only site for serum DHEA-S synthe-
sis.17 In contrast, both testes and adrenal glands can secrete
it in men.34,35 As a consequence, serum DHEA-S may not
precisely reflect the production of DHEA/DHEA-S in adre-
nal glands in men, especially in adrenal diseases. Besides,
whether the CYP17 expression differs in genders is still
unknown.
In subjects with PA, the treatments of APA and IHA are
different. However, differential diagnosis between APA and
IHA are still controversial. In a recent study, CYP17, an
enzyme involved in DHEA/DHEA-S, has been shown to be
down-regulated in subjects with PA. In our study, we found
that serum DHEA-S level is lower especially in females
with APA but not IHA. This finding may help in the differ-
ential diagnosis between APA and IHA in the female
population.
The strength of this study is that we analyzed our data
in both genders, which was not conducted in previous
reports. Since DHEA-S is an androgen, this analytic
approach is important. Indeed, we did find different

relationships of serum DHEA-S concentrations to APA
and tumor size. However, this study is limited in its rela-
tively small sample size. As a result, we cannot confirm
that serum DHEA-S concentrations do not decrease in sub-
types of PA such as IHA.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated that women with PA had
lower serum DHEA-S concentrations than subjects with
essential hypertension or normal controls. In subtype
analysis, only women with APA had lower serum
DHEA-S concentrations. There were no differences in
serum DHEA-S concentrations among subjects with
IHA, PA with NIF, normal controls, and those with essen-
tial hypertension. In women with APA, size of the adrenal
tumor was negatively correlated with serum DHEA-S
concentrations. Our findings demonstrated the relation-
ship between the two important steroid hormones in the
adrenal glands. Further studies are needed to evaluate the
role of low DHEA-S production in women with PA and to
explore whether low DHEA-S concentrations in these
