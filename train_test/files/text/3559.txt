Introduction
Over time, man's quests for survival and development have
led him to put wood into use for heating, building, construc-
tion, and utilitarian equipment.As noted by Sowunmi (2009),
knowledge of the environmental setting of man is essential to
obtain a fuller understanding of man and his cultural devel-
opment through time, in view of the close relationship
between man and his environment. Kramer (2006) also noted
that man has learnt to burn wood to warm up himself and to
overcome fear of the night. With time, he began to cook with
it. Thus, cooking and eating utensils were also fashioned
from wood. Therefore, wood is the most important material
contact man has with the entire body of his ancestry. It has
been paramount in aiding, comforting, and paving the way to
civilization. Wood is one of the oldest source of energy and
commonest service material known to man, and has been
used for over 500,000 years (Sharpe, 1976). Factors such as
family size, cost of wood, season, type of cooking device,
alternative energy sources, and the type of wood determine
the level of wood consumption (Hamed, 1990). According to
Food and Agricultural Organization of United Nations
(1995), two out of five people worldwide depend on wood or
charcoal as the source of domestic energy. Floor (1997)
noted that wood represented 60% to 90% of the energy
consumption of Africans. In the dry savanna zone of Africa,
wood is the major source of energy (Keita, 1987). In the
Sudan and Sahel climatic zones, majority of the urban popu-
lation and the totality of the rural people depend exclusively
on wood for heating (Hamed, 1990).
The introduction of Western culture has led to the love
and quest for metal/enamel wares, and ceramic objects, with
declining interest in wood products. Hence, wood products
are now sold side by side with metal or ceramic objects in
markets, with the latter gaining upper hand in terms of quan-
tities and quality of products produced and sold. In fact, there
is the belief in some quarters that if wood products are not
patronized, it would over time discourage their production.
This belief has led to the fear that if wood resources are not
conserved for future generations, they will go into extinction
like most African phenomena. In recognition of this immi-
nent disappearance of natural assets, Eluyemi (2002) has
advised that all movable and immovable cultural heritage

A Documentation of Some Traditional
Aspects of Wood Consumption in
Anaocha, Nigeria

and Afamefuna P. Eyisi1
Abstract
The usefulness of wood to mankind varies from place to place, community to community, state to state, and nation to nation.
Wood is a natural product, which is one of the components of biodiversity and a bio-product that serves numerous purposes
to mankind. Such multifunctional purposes include those of sociopolitical, economic, religious, and cultural aspects of man.
This article examines some traditional aspects of wood consumption in Anaocha Local Government Area of Anambra State,
Nigeria, with a view to ascertaining the uses to which the people put wood as a by-product of the trees around them. In-
depth interview, on-the-site observation, and focused group discussion were used to elicit information from knowledgeable
elders, artisans, and wood vendors in different towns that make up the local government area. This research brings to
limelight aspects of wood consumption in Anaocha and lends credence to the belief that wood is still the major source of
revenue and energy in rural areas, probably because it is a free gift of nature. The research findings show that modernization
has not completely eroded the value of wood in the study area.

need to be preserved and handed over to succeeding genera-
tions. Unless this is done, the material evidence of our past
stands the risk of obliteration. If that happens, the link
between the past and the present is severed. This argument
explains why there is need to document aspects of wood con-
sumption in Anaocha Local Government Area (LGA) of
Anambra State, Nigeria.
Method
The article examined the various aspects of wood consump-
tion in Anaocha Local Government Area of Anambra State,
with a view to ascertaining its implications on the lives of the
people (see Figure 1). The study used in-depth interview and
on-the-site observation to elicit information. Semistructured
interview was conducted with two categories of people (key
informants). They are those who are directly involved in the
wood consumption and the local historians. The local arti-
sans provided information on the production processes, the
raw materials used, and uses of finished products. They also
gave insights into the types of products, patterns of demand,
prices, and categories of buyers, whereas the local historians
provided useful background information. A cross-case analy-
sis method was used to analyze the interviews conducted.
This entailed grouping the responses from different people to
the questions or analyzing different perspectives on central

issues. Through this technique, the semistructured interview
guide constituted a descriptive analytical framework for the
qualitative data analysis.
Results and Findings
Wood for Architectural Purpose
In Anaocha LGA, hardwoods such as mahogany (Afzelia
africana), iroko (Milicia excelsa), palm trees (Elaeis
guineensis), ebony (Diospyros species), and others constitute
major raw materials for architectural works such as roofing
of houses, wooden doors and windows, fortifications, and
wooden floors. These wood species are used by most people
in building shops/stores, dwelling houses, shrines, animal
pens, and yam bans. Presently, due to the influence of civili-
zation, architectural uses of wood are gradually being
replaced with modern raw materials for building such as
cement blocks, bricks, aluminum roofing sheets, window
glasses, and rods (see Figure 2).
Wood for Musical Instruments
Most musical instruments, such as flutes, drums, gongs,
bongo, okbokolo, ichaka, and so forth, of both ancient and
contemporary Anaocha people are made of wood of different
types, ranging from hardwood Iroko to soft ones such as
Akpu--Ceiba pentandra. Four types of wooden musical
instruments were identified. The differences are based on
their functions. They are membranophones (Uboaka), aero-
phones (wind instruments; Opi onu), metallophone
(Okungwa), and other resonant materials (Akumaku Aka).
Membranophones (Uboaka) are rhythmical sound-
producing instruments furnished with tensely strained mem-
branes, which are caused to vibrate by percussion or by fric-
tion to produce sound. The pitch produced from them varies
with the degree of tension of the membrane. Because of this,
the name "leather drum" properly applies. There are two
drums of this type: Amounya Abia and Igba. Aerophone, on
the contrary, is a musical instrument that produces sound pri-
marily by causing a body of air to vibrate, without the use of
strings or membranes, and without the vibration of the instru-
ment itself adding considerably to the sound. Metallophone
consists of tuned metal bars, which are struck to make sounds
usually with a mallet. The instrument has a single row of bars
tuned to the distinctive pelog or slendro scale, or a subset of
them. The Western glockenspiel and vibraphone are also
metallophones. They have two rows of bars in an initiation of
the piano keyboard and are toned to the chromatic scale.
Finally, resonant materials are those materials which are
caused to vibrate forcibly by striking one against another -
percussion (see Figure 3).
Wood for Carving Religious Figurines
Anaocha like other Igbo societies practiceAfrican Traditional
Religion (ATR). This is exemplified in their continued use of
wood to carve religious figurines. As noted by Kramer
(2006), Africans use wood from birth till death. The abun-
dance of works of wood may have been caused by the fact
that wood is readily available and easier to work on. Softwood
types such as Akanta (Rauvolfia vomitoria), Ngwu (Alba
feminea), Akpu (C. pentandra), and Ube (Dacryodes edulis)
are used by most wood carvers in Anaocha for carving figu-
rines and other sacred objects such as Ikenga, Agwu, mas-
querade masks, and royal stools/drums. This aspect of wood
usage in the area is very important because it affirms the
people's support for African cosmology and preference in
carved objects made with good wood. The woods for carving
purposes in Anaocha are shown in Table 1 and Figure 4.
It should be noted that carved objects are admired based
on the beauty of the carved work. Inquiry about the quality of
wood used comes to play only when the admirer wants to
make a purchase. This is to assure him or her of the durability
of the carved work. Again, the final touch of the master
carver on the object represents his desire and love for
perfection.
Wood for Fortification
In the ancient times, wooden materials such as Ogilisi
(Newbouldia laevis) and palm fronds (E. guineensis) were
used in making fences and gates of most compounds in Igbo
communities. This is still obtainable in Anaocha LGA. Palm
fronds, Ogilisi, and planks lumbered from palm trees are
used to fortify family compounds of those that cannot afford
cement blocks. Wood is also used for boundary demarcation
of compounds, farmlands, villages, and towns (see Figure 5).
Wood for Casket Production
Right from time immemorial, products from wood have been
used in various forms to bury the dead. In many Igbo-
speaking communities and beyond, wood resources such as
bamboo stems and banana leaves were used to bury people
of diverse social classes. Presently, wood is put into a

specialized and constructive shape known as the casket, with
the sole purpose of burying the dead. Caskets are of different
sizes, shapes, and patterns/designs, and are made from dif-
ferent types of wood such as Agbu (whitewood--Alstonia
boonei), Obeche (Terminalia superba), Mansonia (Mansonia
altissima), teak (Oworo)--Tectona grandis. According to
our informants, five types of caskets are produced in
Anaocha: up-high casket, six-corner casket, dome casket,
top-stone caskets, and concord caskets.
The Up-high casket after production does not require
painting, rather fanny is applied as a decorative substance.
The six-corner casket is next in rank of quality to the up-high
casket, and all types of wood can be used for its production.
The dome casket is the most expensive type of casket in
Anaocha because of the complex dome shape design carved
on top of the casket's cover. Two types of hardwood (Agbu
and Mansonia) are used for its production. The top-stone
casket, on the contrary, derives its name from the grave stone
found on the top of the cover of the casket, whereas the con-
cord casket is the most affordable casket among the study
group. It is good looking and well designed, and quality
wood types such as Agbu, Obeche, and Oworo are used for
its production (see Figure 6).
Wood as a Source of Energy Supply
According to Babanyara and Saleh (2010), fuelwood consti-
tutes the main source of fuel for cooking, as more than 76%
of Nigerians use fuelwood, leaving only 26% for cooking
gas, kerosene, coal, and electricity. On the contrary, Sambo
(2005) argued that 80 million cubic meters (4.3 × 109 kg) of
fuelwood are used by Nigerians for cooking and other

domestic purposes per annum. Sources of fuelwood include
deadwoods, dry branches, twigs, wet/life woods, sawdust
from wood, and charcoal extracted from wood. Users of fuel-
wood in the study area include smiths, palm oil millers, cas-
sava (garri) producers, and bakery industries, among others.
Wood extracts from trees such as Dialium guineense, Burkea
africana, Pentaclethra macrophylla, Cylicodiscus gabunen-
sis, and Tamarindus indica are mostly used for fuelwood/
energy supply and as such are threatened by extinction due to
their excessive exploitation (see Figure 7).
Wood as a bio-product can serve as a source of income
generation to man. In Anaocha, wood resources such as fuel-
wood (firewood), sawdust, and charcoal (extracted from
wood) constitute major sources of income to most families
that depend on it to improve their standard of living.
Ethnographic sources revealed that fuelwood (firewood) and
wood resources are highly demanded by most entrepreneurs,
such as bread bakers, plastic companies, brick makers, garri
producers, smiths, and so forth, on daily basis in Anaocha
and beyond. Mostly wood and wood sources (charcoal, saw-
dust, etc.) are transported by wood vendors from rural areas
to urban cities for sale and use. Monies generated from sale
of wood resources are used in solving domestic problems
such as payment of children's school fees, house rents, and
feeding, to mention but a few.
Wood for Household Furniture
Anaocha traditional crafts reveal an understanding of the
harmonious utilization of wood resources. Furniture pro-
duced from wood sources in the study area included uphol-
stery, cane chairs, basket, broom, mat, and mortar/pestle. All
these constitute household materials used for subsistence liv-
ing in the study area.
Oga tree provides major raw material for cane weaving,
and cane crafts are produced in various sizes and shapes to
serve different purposes. Its products include cane cupboard,
cane bed, cane chair, cane basket, and cane mirror. Baskets,
on the contrary, are produced in large quantities, ranging
from large to medium and small to extra small sizes serving
different purposes.
Abroom is made up of 400 to 800 broom sticks, which are
scrapped off their leaves neatly. The sticks are tied strongly
together with a twine and are ready for use. Brooms are
packaged in bundles and are sold in the market. Palm leaves
and coconut palm leaves can be used in the production of
different kinds of mats. Mats are used either for sleeping (a
kind of bed), ornamental shrub, or for fencing compounds.
Mortar plays an important role as kitchen utensil. In
Anaocha, mortar and pestle are too important to be missed
out in any family, and this explains why it is among the items
a newly married lady takes to her husband's house. The
objects are used together for pounding of yam, cassava, and
palm fruit, and for grinding pepper and other ingredients
used in cooking soup and stew. Mortars and pestles are of
different sizes: Ikwe--big mortar, Odo--medium-sized mor-
tar, and Okwa--small mortar. They have different design
patterns and perform different functions in every household
in Anaocha. Hardwood types such as Iroko (M. excelsa) and
mahogany (A. africana) are used for making mortars and
pestles of various types. Outside the aforementioned types,
the people also carve utilitarian equipments like bowl for dif-
ferent purposes such as food bowl (Okwa nri), meat bowl
(Okwa anu), kola nut bowl (Okwa oji), and axe handle
(Anyuike).
Discussion: Implications of Wood
Consumption in Anaocha LGA
In Anaocha, wood and wood products have socioeconomic,
political, religious, and cultural implications. These are
enshrined in the people's ways of life and exemplified in
their norms, values, beliefs, and customs. Religiously, some
trees (Iroko, Ofor, Anunuebe, and Ogilisi) are perceived to be
sacred because of the religious roles such trees play within
the locality as well as their perceived inherent supernatural
powers. Trees, such as Iroko, coconut, and so forth, are
linked to reincarnation of certain individuals. It is a general
belief that a reincarnated individual buries his or her Iyi-uwa
(a special kind of stone, which forms the link between an
Ogbanje and the spirit world) with which his or her

reincarnation was made possible under such trees. Iyi-uwa is
an object from Igbo mythology that binds the spirit of a dead
child (known as Ogbanje) to the world, causing it to return
and be born again by the same mother. Furthermore, coconut
tree is associated with reproduction. This explains why
Anaocha people bury the umbilical cord of a new born baby
under the tree upon its natural fall-off. Thus, the child owns
the tree upon maturity with the belief that as the coconuts are
harvested, his or her offspring will be multiplied.
Trees such as Ofor and Iroko are regarded as sacred; such
trees are perceived to be living sacrifice. Ethnographic
sources revealed that white or red cloths are tied around the
tree and that such cloth is often stained with blood of sacrifi-
cial animals such as fowls, goats, cows, and so forth.
Furthermore, the foot of the tree is decorated with broken
pieces of potsherds and stones that are arranged strategically.
Prayers and libations are often done under such a tree which
is often linked to a particular deity.
Wood types such as Iroko, Akanta, and Ngwu are used in
carving sacred objects such as masquerade heads, images of
deities (gods and goddesses), and religious musical instru-
ments such as drums, gongs, and flutes. This is because of
the belief that they are associated with Ala, the earth god-
dess, and has connection to the supernatural beings or the
spirit world that links the people with their ancestors and
ancestress. Thus, some trees are revered as demigods and
attract lots of rituals, ceremonies, offerings of sacrifices,
and dedications in the communities where they are found. In
fact, sacred trees such as Iroko, Ngwu, and Ofor are installed
as gods by most communities in Anaocha.
Wood and wood resources constitute diverse economic
benefits to the people of the study area. Trees such as Iroko,
mahogany, and Obeche provide the people with timber mate-
rials such as planks, plywood, and sawdust used by most
woodworkers in the area. Wood also provides raw materials
for building and construction of houses, shops, schools,
churches, furniture, and agricultural implements for farmers
in the area. Wood products such as firewood (fuelwood),
charcoal extracted from wood, provide homes and industries
with alternative sources of energy.
In most homes in Anaocha, firewood performs several
functions and purposes such as cooking, frying, roasting of
food stuffs, lighting, and warming of homes, whereas opera-
tors of most local industries such as bread bakers, local wine
brewers, clay brick makers, wood carvers, and food vendors
make use of wood/wood products in large quantities. Also,
wood products such as firewood and sawdust constitute
major sources of income generation among the people.
Wood, in its own regard, provides the people with timber and
logs of wood used in the building and construction of lorry
carriages, trucks, canoes, boats, and bridges used in convey-
ing goods and services from rural to urban centers within and
beyond the local government. Economic trees, such as
mango, guava, orange, pawpaw, pears of all species, coconut
trees, and so forth, serve as sources of food, revenue genera-
tion, and are of medicinal values.
Cultural and sociopolitical values of wood are critical.
Wood products perform numerous functions in Anaocha cul-
tural activities and political organizations. Ethnographic
resources revealed the cultural and political significance and
symbolisms of some sacred woods such as Ofor stick
(Detranium macrocapun) and the Ogilisi plant (N. laevis) in
Anaocha. The Ofor stick, for instance, is a symbol of author-
ity and is held by the eldest in the family. The Ofor stick in
the hand of a titled man (Ozo or Nze) signifies and symbol-
izes a staff of office, symbol of authority, justice, and upright-
ness. This implies that the Ozo title holder in Anaocha is both
the political and spiritual head of his people. The person in
custody of the Ofor is believed by his people to be a man of
integrity, trustworthiness, and dignity whose judgment is
acceptable by all and sundry. On the contrary, it is a general
belief that whoever tells lies or judges wrongly could be
struck dead by the spirit inhabiting the Ofor. The Ogilisi tree
found in most shrines and palaces of paramount personalities
in Anaocha is believed to be a special type of tree with spiri-
tual potency.
It is noteworthy that wood types mostly harvested are the
ones readily available within the area as a free gift of nature,
rather than from a tree plantation. Suffice it to say that some
wood materials are more durable and stronger than others;
hence, wood users prefer them to others. Wood types, such as
mahogany, Iroko, Ngwu, and so forth, are more favored than
Akpu wood. The above statement is in consonance with Njiti
and Kemcha (2002) that wood species which do not essen-
tially serve as a food source but burn well and smoke less are
exploited for fuelwood, whereas some species which are
known to produce gradual and good flame are much more
preferred. On the contrary, wood species that are dense and
resistant to rot and insect attack are exploited for use in furni-
ture and construction works. It should be noted that wood
usage will always be patronized in view of its values to the
people. Thus, rural dwellers tend to depend on wood for con-
sumption and subsistent living, which over time would lead to
deforestation, and as such the impact of climate change would
be felt more within such areas. To avert such impending cri-
sis, efforts should be geared toward wood conservation.
Wood Conservation Practices in Anaocha
According to Eluyemi (2002, p. 3), conservation is "the iden-
tification, documentation (appropriate registration) and
proper storage of cultural objects, whether in private hands
or in museum." The obvious reason for proper conservation
of cultural and natural objects (wood, wood resources, and
wood products) is to keep them whole and safe for now and
for the future and to make them available for research and for
interpretation. Thus, the major objective of conservation or
preservation is to keep the heritage in good condition, that is,
to prevent damage or destruction from natural, chemical, and
biological agents (Eluyemi, 2002).
The forefathers of the people already had their traditional
ways of preserving and conserving wood/wood products.
Okonkwo et al. 7
Anaocha people ofAnambra State conserve and preserve avail-
able wood resources in their environment. There are two meth-
ods of wood conservation practiced inAnaocha: traditional and
modern methods. The traditional methods of wood conserva-
tion are enshrined in the people's norms, values, beliefs, and
customs exemplified in taboos, local laws, and sacred sanctions
which have, over time, become the people's way of life. These
methods are effective in conserving trees, grooves, wood
resources, and/or wood products. Trees such as Iroko and Ofor
are perceived as sacred and as such people are prohibited from
harvesting them for any purposes. However, in the event of a
proposed developmental project around such a tree, consulta-
tions to oracle are made and the final decision lies with the
chief priest of the deity to which the tree is associated. The
reason is that such sacred trees are regarded as "demigods" and
are believed to be linking humanity to divinity. It is a general
belief among Anaocha people that defaulters might be pun-
ished by the gods, which may result to poor harvest of farm
products, strange ailments, hardship, and even death.
Wood products such as religious figures (Ikenga and mas-
querade masks/objects) and a titled man's regalia (such as
Ozo's sitting stool, staff, etc.) are all conserved using taboos
and sacred sanctions. For instance, noninitiates into mas-
querade cults are prohibited from touching carved masks,
while women are not allowed to carry or sit on an Ozo's
stool. These local laws and sacred sanctions help in instilling
fear and respect for the objects, and as such, their values are
held in high esteem by the people. Such objects are protected
and preserved from damage caused by humans.
Wet/life wood resources are preserved by allowing them
to sun dry and are further preserved under a roof to prevent
contact with rain or water (which are agents of wood decay).
Such wood species are also suspended from touching the
ground where termites could easily attack them. Ethnographic
sources revealed that used or spent engine oil or palm oil is
used as a wood preservative to deter insect attack on timber
materials as well as to protect them from adverse climatic/
weather effects leading to breaking and cracking of wood
surfaces during the harmattan/dry season.
The modern method of wood preservation among the peo-
ple involves the use of chemicals such as insecticides and
pesticides (chemical formula such as Barrettine and
Gamaline, etc.). While those who can afford the cost make
use of these chemicals, others who cannot resort to tradi-
tional methods of preserving wood, wood resources, and
wood products. It is important to note here that the integra-
tion of traditional and modern conservation/management
systems will no doubt move Anaocha wood management
forward. Okpoko and Okonkwo (2005) noted that integrating
modern and traditional methods promises enormous advan-
tages of sustainable conservation practices and methods.
Conclusion
This study has been able to bring to limelight aspects of
wood consumption in Anaocha, ranging from architecture,
musical instruments, religious carvings, and fortification,
among others. The study showed that wood is still the major
source of energy in rural areas and for the majority of urban
dwellers. Wood is essentially obtained from the natural forest
more than from plantation. It is also a flourishing business in
parts of Anaocha area of AnambraState due to their entrepre-
neurship in baking business and other manufacturing indus-
tries within the study area.
Wood is a bio-product that needs to be effectively man-
aged for the purpose of sustainability as well as for posterity;
thus, wood consumption in Anaocha has different aspects
and tells a lot about the people's socioeconomic, cultural,
religious, and political lifestyles. This portrays the fact that
wood resources are used in all ramifications in the develop-
ment and growth of the people's everyday life activities,
including the tangible and intangible aspects of their lives.
For this reason, mechanism should be put in place to ensure
that constant harvesting of wood does not lead to deforesta-
tion in the area. The people should also be encouraged to
make use of other alternatives rather than relying solely on
wood.
