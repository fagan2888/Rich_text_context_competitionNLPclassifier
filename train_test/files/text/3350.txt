Sexual Selection and Humor in Courtship:
A Case for Warmth and Extroversion
Jeffrey A. Hall1
Abstract
This investigation examines a sexual selection-based argument regarding humor's role in courtship (i.e., humor production signals
intelligence/creativity). Lens model (n ¼100) analyses suggest that humor production on Facebook profiles were self-reported and
perceived to be associated with extroversion, not intelligence. Study 2 (n ¼ 289) found that extroversion was associated humor
production, but high school and college grade point average and American College Test (ACT) scores were not. In Study 3, pairs
of opposite-sex strangers (n ¼ 102) interacted for 10­12 min. Males' humor production and females' responsive laughter were
both associated with females' dating interest. Both partners' dating interest was associated with simultaneous laughter. Without
support for the sexual selection argument, three alternative explanations of humor's role in courtship are discussed.

Introduction
A good sense of humor is one of the most sought out character-
istics in a romantic partner (Bressler, Martin, & Balshine, 2006).
There has been considerable debate about why and for whom
that is the case. Drawing from Miller's (2000, 2001) research,
Bressler, Martin, and Balshine (2006) and Kaufman, Kozbelt,
Bromley, and Miller (2008) have suggested that humor is a
sexually selected trait that is an honest signal of intelligence and
creativity, produced by males to be evaluated and appreciated by
females. Therefore, humor production should be moderately
correlated with creativity and intelligence (Miller, 2000), par-
ticularly verbal intelligence (Kaufman et al., 2008). Bressler
et al. (2006) and Wilbur and Campbell (2011) extended Miller's
arguments by identifying two key sex differences: (i) females
should prefer males who produce humor more than males prefer
females who produce humor and (ii) to accurately judge males'
productive ability and guard against deceit, females should pos-
sess more acute humor comprehension skills. As for humor
appreciation, Kaufman et al. (2008) propose that females who
show greater humor appreciation should be less preferred during
mate selection because it is a sign of low mate quality (or des-
peration). The present multistudy investigation utilizes three
measures of humor (i.e., lens model, self-report, and observed)
in three contexts (i.e., Facebook, self-reported courtship
behavior, and first-time interactions) to test Miller's (2000,
2001) sexual selection hypotheses.
Sexual Selection
Due to greater investment in procreation and parenting, the
female sex limits mating opportunities in many species (Tri-
vers, 1972). For human males, mating can result in reproduc-
tion without further involvement in child rearing. Human
female reproduction is substantially costlier due to the demands
of pregnancy and weaning. This creates pressure for females to
choose a mate who will increase the likelihood of survival of
the offspring and will provide more paternal investment.
Therefore, traits in males that are attractive to females are ones
most likely to meet those criteria. When a trait offers benefits to
or serves the needs of one sex over the other, given unequal
commitments required during reproduction, weaning, and par-
enting, it should demonstrate a sex difference in display during

courtship and in desirability in the opposite sex. Evidence show-
ing robust, or at least moderately sized, sex differences supports
theories of sexual selection (Kaufman et al., 2008).
One characteristic males might advertise and females might
evaluateishumor production.Humor productionisdefined asthe
ability to produce humorous communication or actions, and/or to
be regarded by others as being witty, funny, or humorous (Thor-
son & Powell, 1993). Miller (2000, 2001; Kaufman et al., 2008)
emphasizes the set of cognitive skills necessary to produce
humor,particularlycreativityandintelligence.Relyinguponsex-
ual signaling theory, Miller (2000) conceives of humor as a sexu-
ally selected fitness indicator of the underlying trait of
intelligence. Fitness indicators should not be easily counterfeited
and should bereliable indicatorsof the underlyingtrait (Kaufman
et al., 2008; Miller, 2001). Applying the theory of sexual selec-
tion to humor, humans prefer a partner with a sense of humor
because it signifies good genes, particularly intelligence.
The relationship between intelligence/creativity and humor
production is weak or mixed (Storey, 2003). Proponents of the
humor­intelligence link (e.g., Kaufman et al., 2008) admit to
limited evidence of the association and note there is evidence to
the contrary. Kaufman et al. recommend that humor produc-
tion, creativity, and intelligence should be ``modestly inter-
correlated'' to support sexual selection claims and that humor
production should be particularly associated with verbal intel-
ligence, more so than global intelligence (p. 253). For it to
signal underlying traits, however, others should also perceive
a relationship between humor and intelligence, yet this associ-
ation has also shown mixed support (e.g., Wilbur & Campbell,
2011). In the context of courtship, humorous male suitors are
considered less rather than more intelligent (Bressler & Bal-
shine, 2006; Lundy, Tan, & Cunningham, 1998). Senko and
Fyffe (2010) also found a negative relationship between per-
ceived humorousness and intelligence when females evaluate
males' pickup lines. Weisfeld et al. (2011) reported the asso-
ciation between partners' impressions of their spouses' sense of
humor and impressions of their spouses' intelligence in five
countries (i.e., United States, China, Russia, Turkey, and
United Kingdom). Perceptions of intelligence were weakly
related to perceptions of partner's sense of humor in three
countries and not associated for two others (i.e., Russia and
Turkey). To further test Miller's argument regarding sexual
selection and humor production in courtship:
Hypothesis 1a: Humor production will be associated with
intelligence, particularly verbal intelligence.
Hypothesis 1b: Humor production will be perceived to be
associated with intelligence.
The sexual selection argument hinges on several key sex
differences. Evidence in support of the sexual selection
mechanism would occur when sex differences appear. The lack
of difference would suggest that both males and females stand
to gain similar advantages by possessing a trait. One important
sex difference involves preference for humor production in a
partner. According to theories of sexual selection, females
should prefer males who produce humor more than males pre-
fer females who produce humor (Bressler et al., 2006; Wilbur
& Campbell, 2011). There is some indirect evidence in support
of this argument. In mixed sex social environments, male
speakers are more likely to elicit laughter from audiences, and
females are more likely to laugh as audience members (Pro-
vine, 1993). Analyses of laughter in naturally forming couples
or groups found that while females laughed as much as males
overall, females laughed more than males when paired with a
male stranger (Owren & Bachorowski, 2003) and with male
friends (Mehu & Dunbar, 2008). This was also found with deaf
signers who can see but not hear the vocal laughter of their
conversational partners (Provine & Emmorey, 2006). Analyses
of singles' ads found that males were more likely to offer
humor, and females were more likely to request a humorous
partner (Provine, 2000; Wilbur & Campbell, 2011). Further-
more, females evaluate humorous males as being a more desir-
able relationship partner compared to males' evaluation of
humorous females (Bressler & Balshine, 2006; Bressler
et al., 2006). These hypotheses follow:
Hypothesis 2a: Males will produce humor more than
females.
Hypothesis 2b: Females will be more interested in humor-
producing males compared to males' interest in humor-
producing females.
Distinctions between humor production, appreciation, and
comprehension are of particular importance when applying the
theory of sexual selection to humor in courtship. Humor com-
prehension is the ability to ``get'' the joke, to see how it is
funny, or the ability to recognize if something is a joke (Carrell,
1997). Humor appreciation is defined as someone who laughs a
lot, laughs easily, and is a good audience; someone who is
mirthful (Martin, 1998). When humor production is interpreted
as a sign of underlying mate value, the distinction between
humor comprehension and appreciation becomes quite impor-
tant. Due to disparities in investment in offspring, females
should exercise caution when evaluating males' advances.
Kaufman et al. (2008) argue that ``the optimal humor apprecia-
tion system would comprehend many more attempts at humor
than it actually finds amusing--it should `get' many more
jokes than it genuinely laughs at . . . . Thus, humor appreciation
may be an important part of mate choice [by females], just as
humor production is an important part of courtship effort [by
males]'' (p. 242). Kaufman et al. argue that to accurately judge
males' production of humor, females should develop an acute
ability to comprehend humor or to discriminate between natu-
rally funny or faked humor. Females' greater ability to judge
the humorousness of males' production is critical to Kaufman
et al.'s case of humor as a result of sexual selection. Females
should be more capable than males when comprehending
humor but not necessarily show their appreciation for males'
humor. Kaufman et al. (2008) argue that females who show too
much appreciation should be regarded as a poor mate choice

because of their lack of discriminating ability between skillful
and less skillful displays of humor. Therefore:
Hypothesis 3: Females should possess greater humor com-
prehension than males.
Hypothesis 4a: Females will show more humor apprecia-
tion than males.
Hypothesis 4b: Females who show more humor apprecia-
tion will have lower mate value than females who show less
humor appreciation.
Study 1
Material and Method
Procedure and Participants
Study 1 utilizes data gathered as part of a larger Brunswik (1956)
lens model investigation of personality on Facebook published
elsewhere (Hall, Pennington, & Lueders, 2014). One hundred
targetswererecruited througha combinationofstudentsata large
Midwestern university who participated for partial course credit
(n ¼ 28) and a snowball sample of Facebook users (n ¼ 72). The
mean age for target participants was 32.3 (SD ¼ 12.23, range ¼
18­62), and female participants accounted for 57% of the sample.
The majority of target participants were White (88%), and other
race/ethnicities were represented as follows: 5% mixed race, 4%
AsianAmerican,2% AfricanAmerican,and1% Latino/Hispanic.
Target participants allowed study coordinators to access and
download their Facebook profiles. The eight most recent pro-
file pictures, all information available on the About page of the
profile, and any wall posts listed as ``recent'' by Facebook were
downloaded. The files were combined to form one pdf for each
target. Targets' names were erased and replaced with `profile
owner,' and any identifying information (i.e., contact informa-
tion and email address) was removed.
Measures
Targets completed an online survey regarding their humor
orientation (HO; Booth-Butterfield & Booth-Butterfield,
1991; I regularly tell jokes when in groups; People usually laugh
when I tell jokes or funny stories). This measure was reliable (a
¼ .92). Participants also completed measures of extroversion (a
¼ .88) and agreeableness (a ¼ .80; John, Naumann, & Soto,
2008). Five items drawn from John et al.'s measure of openness
were selected to measure intelligence/creativity (i.e., is original,
comes up with new ideas; is ingenious, a deep thinker; is inven-
tive; is sophisticated in art, music, or literature; and has an active
imagination). This measure was reliable (a ¼ .78).
Target profiles were coded by up to four independent
coders. Coders were trained as a group, and the codebook was
refined. Reliability was measured using Krippendorf's a
MACRO (Hayes & Krippendorf, 2007). Four user-generated
cues were chosen as indicators of humor production: attempts
at humor in photos (a ¼ .60), attempts at humor in quotes in the
About page (a ¼ .76), attempts at humor in status updates (a ¼
.35), and laughter (i.e., haha, LoL) in status updates (a ¼ 1.00).
A total of 35 observers, who were strangers to the targets,
examined target profiles and then estimated the HO and person-
ality of each target. HO estimates were presented in terms of how
the observer saw the target (i.e., ``This person regularly tells jokes
when in groups''). Observers estimated target personality and
intelligence/creativity using the same items as targets, only pre-
sented in terms of how the observersaw the target. The evaluation
of each target took between and 15 min, resulting in a total of
approximately 12­16 hr per person. To prevent fatigue, observers
signed up for several time blocks, and after 10 targets were eval-
uated,observers tooka 10-min break.Thirty observers completed
all100targets,andfivedroppedoutforvaryingreasons(e.g.,time
conflicts). Observers were paid US$75 upon completion. All
studyprocedureswereinstitutional reviewboard (IRB) approved.
Results
The lens model technique enabled the possibility of measuring
both the associations among humor production (i.e., HO), intel-
ligence, and personality and the perceived associations among
humor production, intelligence, and personality. Bivariate corre-
lations between profile owners' HO and intelligence were not
significant, r(99) ¼ .10, p ¼ .34, therefore Hypothesis 1a was not
supported. The relationship between humor and extroversion
was significant, r(99) ¼ .30, p ¼ .002. Bivariate correlations
among strangers' perceptions of profile owners' humor, intelli-
gence, and personality were conducted. Results indicated that
the association between perceived HO and perceived intelli-
gence was not significant, r(99) ¼ .06, p ¼ .56, therefore,
Hypothesis 1b was not supported. The relationship between per-
ceived HO and perceived extroversion was strong, r(99) ¼ .73,
p < .001, and the relationship between perceived HO and per-
ceived agreeableness, r(99) ¼ .18, p ¼ .04, was significant.
Three of the four content analyzed cues measuring humor pro-
duction were positively associated with profile owners' self-
reported HO (Table 1). Profile owner HO was associated with
producing humor in several places on a Facebook profile. Observ-
ers also believed that all the four cues were associated with target
HO.InresponsetoHypothesis1b,estimatesoftargets'intelligence
were not related to humor production for three cues, and were
negatively associated with intelligence laughing in status updates
(e.g., haha and LoL). The production of humor on Facebook pro-
files was strongly associated with observers' estimates of extrover-
sion for all the four humor production cues. A multivariate analysis
of variance (MANOVA) tested predicted sex differences in humor
production in target profiles (Hypothesis 2a), but no differences
were detected in the omnibus test, F(4, 85) ¼ 1.81, p ¼ .135.
Discussion
Results demonstrate that targets' humor production was unre-
lated to targets' self-reported intelligence (Hypothesis 1a) and
unrelated to observers' perceptions of targets' intelligence
Hall 3
(Hypothesis 1b). Although targets who produced more humor by
self-report were indeed more likely to have humorous pictures,
status updates, and quotes on their profile, these three character-
istics were unrelated to observers' perceptions of target intelli-
gence. Expressing laughter via status updates (e.g., haha and
LoL) was negatively associated with perceptions of intelligence.
Extroversion was moderately associated with targets' self-
reported humor production and was strongly associated with
observers' perceptions of targets' humor production. Observers,
who were strangers to the targets, used all three cues of humor
production when they estimated targets' humor and extroversion
but not when estimating intelligence. Although agreeableness
was associated with attempts at humor in Facebook profiles, it
was unassociated with targets' self-reported humor production
and only weakly associated with observers' estimates of targets'
humor production. Finally, results did not support Hypothesis
2a, which predicted sex differences in humor production.
Study 1 shows consistent support that humor production is
associated with and is perceived to be associated with extrover-
sion, weakly associated with agreeableness, and unassociated
with intelligence. However, the intelligence measure in Study 1
was self-reported and stranger perceived rather than an exter-
nal, objective measure of intelligence, particularly verbal intel-
ligence. Although social network sites (SNS) are an
increasingly common location for identifying romantic partners
(i.e., 7% of Americans married in the last 10 years met via a
SNS; Cacioppo, Cacioppo, Gonzaga, Ogburn, & VanderWeele,
2013), Facebook is not explicitly a courtship context. Study 2
uses more objective measures of intelligence and verbal ability
(i.e., grade point average [GPA]; American College Test [ACT]
scores) in relation to humor production, comprehension, and
appreciation in courtship as well as self-reported mate value.
Study 2
Material and Method
Procedure and Participants
Participants were recruited from introductory communication
courses at a large Midwestern university. Selecting from
several study options, participants completed an online survey
instrument about ``humor in courtship'' in return for partial
course credit. After consenting, participants completed mea-
sures of humor, personality, mate value, scholastic achieve-
ment, and demographics. The procedure was IRB approved.
Two hundred eighty nine undergraduates aged 18­38 (M ¼
19.62, SD ¼ 2.72; n ¼ 200 female) participated. Eighty percent
were White, 7% were Asian or Asian American, 6% were
African American, and 3% were Latino/Hispanic. The remain-
ing participants did not report race or ethnicity. All participants
were self-reported to be heterosexual.
Measures
Participants responded to all the questions in response to the
following prompt: ``For the following questions, consider how
you behave when you meet people you might be interested in.
You might be attracted to them or interested in developing a
relationship with them. For each question, try to think about how
you generally behave in that circumstance.'' All responses were
measured on a 7-point Likert-type scale. To test hypotheses
related to humor production, comprehension, and appreciation,
three existing humor inventories were consulted (i.e., Craik,
Lampert, & Nelson, 1996; Thorson & Powell, 1993; Wilbur &
Campbell, 2011). In addition, 13 new items were written to
reflect the conceptual definitions of each concept. In total, 61
items were included. To test the factor structure of these 61
items, exploratory factor analysis with principle factor analysis
and promax rotation was conducted. Upon consulting the pattern
matrix and the elbow of the scree plot, the first four factors were
selected for analysis. These four factors explained 53% of the
variance and had large eigenvalues: 13.47, 5.98, 4.10, and 3.18.
Humor production was measured using 8 items from Thor-
son and Powell's (1993) measure. Two factors of humor com-
prehension emerged. Discerning humor comprehension was
measured by 3 items reflecting understanding of a joke but a
lack of outward response (i.e., ``I sometimes get the joke, but I
just don't think it is funny''; ``I enjoy a good joke, but won't
necessarily laugh out loud''; ``I have a choosy sense of humor, I
only laugh when it is really funny''). This measure was com-
posed of all new items. General humor comprehension was

``I am sometimes the person in a group who doesn't get the
joke''; ``I sometimes have to ask `Are you joking?' because I
can't tell if someone is being funny or not''; ``Other people
often have tell me they were joking because I couldn't tell'').
Humor appreciation reflected a sense of humor that enjoyed
humor without concern for its objective humorousness. This
measure was composed of 3 items drawn from Craik, Lampert,
and Nelson (1996; e.g., ``Laughs at everything''; Laughs with-
out discriminating between more or less clever remarks'') and 2
new items (i.e., ``I laugh at the weakest jokes''; ``I laugh easily,
it doesn't really have to be funny'').
Academic achievement. Participants reported on four measures of
academic achievement: cumulative high school GPA (n ¼ 289,
M ¼ 3.56, SD ¼ .45), overall ACT score (n ¼ 256, M ¼ 25.52,
SD ¼ 3.70), verbal ACT score (n ¼ 236, M ¼ 26.26, SD ¼
5.16), and cumulative college GPA (n ¼ 177, M ¼ 3.15, SD ¼
.60). Those not reporting college GPA were first-semester
freshman, and 19% stated that they had not taken or could not
remember their ACT scores. Extroversion and agreeableness
were measured using the Big Five scale (John et al., 2008).
The mate value measure required participants to self-report
the degree to which they possess qualities compared to others
of their same sex (1 ¼ I score much lower on this characteristic
to 7 ¼ I score much higher on this characteristic; Fletcher,
Simpson, Thomas, & Giles, 1999). This measure of mate value
has five subdimensions: status (e.g., ``Has a nice house or
apartment''), warmth (e.g., ``A good listener in general''), vital-
ity (e.g., ``Sexy''), passionate in romantic relationships (e.g.,
``Passionate in romantic relationships''), and committed in
romantic relationships (e.g., ``Committed in romantic relation-
ships''). The original measure of passion in relationships
included a single item regarding a sense of humor. This item
was removed so as not to conflate other humor measures with
mate value (Table 2).
Results
To text Hypothesis 1a, ordinary least square regression was
conducted. Each humor construct was treated as a criterion
variable individually. Measures of intelligence, personality,
and sex were treated as independent variables, and control
variables were age and race/ethnicity (White ¼ 1). Humor
production was positively associated with extroversion, B ¼
.25, SE ¼ .06, b ¼ .25, t(287) ¼ 4.38, p < .001, R2 D¼ .18, but
unrelated to measures of intelligence and sex. Results do not
support Hypothesis 1a or Hypothesis 2a.
A discerning comprehension of humor was negatively
associated with extroversion, B ¼ À.29, SE ¼ .08, b ¼ À.24,

Discussion
Neither Hypothesis 1a nor Hypothesis 2a was supported:
Humor production in a courtship context was unrelated to mea-
sures of intelligence and verbal ability as measured by high
school and college GPA and ACT scores and showed no sex
difference. Factor analyses found that humor comprehension
was constituted by two separate factors. The first reflected an
ability to get the joke without laughing at it (i.e., being choosy),
and the second was someone who generally gets the joke.
Neither discerning humor comprehension nor general humor
comprehension showed sex differences, which did not support
Hypothesis 3. No sex differences were found in humor appre-
ciation, which did not support Hypothesis 4a. Finally, humor
appreciation was explored in relation to mate value (Hypoth-
esis 4b), but there was no evidence that humor appreciation was
negatively associated with self-perceived mate value. Rather, it
was positively associated with warmth and passion in a rela-
tionship in females.
Although Study 2 provided evidence supporting the rela-
tionship between humor and extroversion and the absence of
a relationship between humor and intelligence, it was based
upon self-reports of humor production, appreciation, and mate
value. Self-reported measures of humor are weakly associated
with behavioral measures of joke production and laughter
(Kohler & Ruch, 1996). Self-reported desirability is not a direct
measure of mate value in a courtship-specific context. Study 3
used observational data from recorded interactions of opposite-
sex, heterosexual, and single strangers to further test
hypotheses.
Study 3
Materials and Method
Procedure and Participants
Study 3 utilizes data from a study of nonverbal behavior pub-
lished elsewhere (Hall & Xing, 2015). Participants were 51
pairs of single (i.e., not in a committed romantic relationship
or a ``serious dating'' relationship), heterosexual students
recruited from introductory communication courses at a large
Midwestern university. Participants received partial class credit
for participating in the study worth less than .5% of their final
grade. Procedures were IRB approved. Participants were pri-
marily White (78%), and other races/ethnicities were repre-
sented: 7% Asian American, 7% Hispanic/Latino, 6%
African American, and 2% Native American. Mean age was
19.2 years (SD ¼ 2.1, range 18­30; mode ¼ 19).
Interaction Procedure
One male participant and one female participant were sched-
uled to arrive at the interaction lab for the same 20-min time
period. Upon arrival, participants were led to separate rooms
and gave written consent to be audio- and video-recorded.
When both participants had arrived, they were brought to the
same room and introduced. The interaction lab had two chairs
facing one another at a distance of approximately 3 feet. Two
digital, wall-mounted cameras recorded the interaction. After
being introduced, the participants were read study instructions.
They were told the purpose of the study was to better under-
stand how people form first impressions and that they would be
interacting for about 10 min. To help facilitate and standardize
the conversation, a set of prescreened question cards were pro-
vided. Each participant chose 5 of the 10 cards and took turns
asking each other the questions. Participants were instructed
that the goal of the interaction was to have a conversation, so
they did not need to ask all the questions on the cards. They
were encouraged to go on tangents and ask their own questions.
Participants were asked to keep talking until the researcher
returned.
Postinteraction Procedure
After at least 10 min but no more than 12 min had passed,
participants were interrupted by the researcher and put in sep-
arate rooms. Without consulting each other, both completed a
postinteraction questionnaire. Participants were asked if they
had met their interaction partner previously and none indicated
that they had. Dating interest was measured using 4 items. Two
items were adapted from Grammer and Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1990;
i.e., ``I would go on a date with him/her,'' ``I would give my
phone number to my partner if I were asked for it'') and 2 items
were created (i.e., ``I would like to meet this person again,'' ``I
would like to talk to this person again''). The measure was
reliable (/ ¼ .86).
Measures: Humor Production and Appreciation
Coders were trained individually and as a group for 15 hr by
coding videos from pilot data to standardize codebook use.
After training, coders independently coded the videos. Relia-
bility was calculated using Hayes and Krippendorff's (2007) a
MACRO. Behaviors were counted for each minute of the inter-
action. Humor production was operationalized as attempts at
humor during the conversation (/ ¼ .67). Type of humor was
not differentiated. Humor appreciation was measured in two
ways: laughter in response to humorous attempt (/ ¼ .90;
Mehu & Dunbar, 2008) and simultaneous laughing (Grammer
& Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1990; / ¼ .75).
Results
To test Hypothesis 2a and Hypothesis 4a, two paired samples
t-tests were conducted. Hypothesis 2a was not supported: males
attempted more humor per minute, M ¼ .20, SD ¼ .20, than
females, M ¼ .14, SD ¼ .17, but this difference was not sig-
nificant, t ¼ 1.77, p ¼ .08. In support of Hypothesis 4a, females
laughed at more of males' humor attempts, M ¼ .10, SD ¼ .14,
than males laughed at females' humor attempts, M ¼ .05,
SD ¼ .09, t ¼ 2.13, p ¼ .038.
6 Evolutionary Psychology
When data are collected from conversational partners, par-
ticipants' responses are related (Kenny, Kashy, & Cook, 2006).
One partner's humor production and the other partner's laugh-
ter are dependent upon one another; they are nonindependent.
As recommended by Kenny et al. (2006) for distinguishable
dyads, the Actor-Partner Independence Model (APIM) and
structural equation modeling were used to estimate one's own
production and appreciation of humor with one's own dating
interest (actor effect) and with one's partner's dating interest
(partner effect) using Mplus 7.0 (Muthen & Muthen, 1998/
2007). By correlating the error terms of the variables, the APIM
accounts for shared variance of the dyad. The actor effects
demonstrate whether one's own humor production or apprecia-
tion is associated with one's own dating interest. Partner effects
test whether one's own humor production or appreciation is
associated with partners' dating interest. Dyads were consid-
ered distinguishable by sex. As recommended by Kenny et al.
(2006), when significant effects were identified for males or
females, they were fixed to be equivalent. If model fit was
unchanged, as determined by a w2 test, then paths were consid-
ered equivalent. If model fit worsened, paths were considered
distinct and sex differences were reported.
Humor production was not associated with dating interest in
conversational partner for males, b ¼ À.004, SE ¼ .078, p ¼
.96, or for females, b ¼ .032, SE ¼ .070, p ¼ .64. Humor
appreciation showed different results. The number of humor
attempts that a female laughed at was positively associated
with her dating interest in her male partner, b ¼ .168, SE ¼
.075, p ¼ .024, R2 ¼ .092. The same was not found for males, b
¼ À.068, SE ¼ .160, p ¼ .67. Yet, this difference was not
significant, w2 ¼ 1.64, df ¼ 1, p > .05. The partner effects
demonstrated a complementary pattern of results. Namely,
humor production by males was associated with females' dat-
ing interest, b ¼ .124, SE ¼ .050, p ¼ .019, R2 ¼ .079. Humor
production by females was not associated with males' dating
interest, b ¼ À.063, SE ¼ .091, p ¼ .486. This difference was
significant, w2 ¼ 3.896, df ¼ 1, p < .05. Humor appreciation by
males was unrelated to dating interest by females, b ¼ À.011,
SE ¼ .123, p ¼ .93. Humor appreciation by females was unre-
lated to dating interest by males, b ¼ À.007, SE ¼ .111, p ¼
.95. Finally, humor appreciation, measured through simulta-
neous laughter, was positively associated with females' dating
interest, b ¼ .083, SE ¼ .037, p ¼ .012, R2 ¼ .22, and males'
dating interest, b ¼ .066, SE ¼ .029, p ¼ .024, R2 ¼ .13. This
effect was greater for female dating interest, w2 ¼ 10.077,
df ¼ 1, p < .001.
Because female humor appreciation--through laughter--
was dependent upon the number of attempts at humor the
male made, one additional analysis was conducted. Female
laughter was divided by male humor production, creating a
ratio of male attempt-to-female laughs. This ratio was unas-
sociated with male dating interest, b ¼ .21, SE ¼ .69, p ¼ .36,
and female dating interest, b ¼ À.065, SE ¼ .41, p ¼ .75.
Female laughing at a higher or lower portion of humorous
attempts (i.e., being less or more discriminating) was unre-
lated to dating interest.
Discussion
Study 3 confirmed the results of Study 2 by demonstrating that
there was no sex difference in humor production (Hypothesis
2a). However, there was evidence in support of Hypothesis 2b
in that the more attempts at humor a male made and the more of
those attempts a female laughed at, the more interested in dat-
ing the female was. This relationship was not found for males.
Results also supported Hypothesis 4a in that females showed
more humor appreciation (i.e., more laughs) than did males,
confirming other observational studies (Owren & Bachor-
owski, 2003; Provine & Emmory, 2006). However, when part-
ners laughed at the same time, both males and females were
more interested in dating one another (Grammer & Eibl-
Eibesfeldt, 1990). Results do not support Hypothesis 4b, which
predicted that females who show more humor appreciation
would have lower mate value than females who show less
humor appreciation. When humor appreciation was measured
by laughter in response to attempts at humor, results indicated
that males' dating interest in females was unrelated to females'
humor appreciation. Furthermore, the attempt to laugh ratio
demonstrated that a female having a more discriminating
humor appreciation was not considered more attractive by a
male nor was it indicative of her attraction to him.
General Discussion
Miller (2000, 2001) and others (e.g., Bressler et al., 2006)
suggest that humor production is an honest signal of underlying
creativity and intelligence. To effectively serve as such a sig-
nal, humor production should moderately correlate with intel-
ligence and creativity, and this link should be found in others'
perceptions of the humor producer. Study 1 found no evidence
that humor production (i.e., HO) showed any association with
underlying intelligence or perceived intelligence. Rather,
humorous behavior on Facebook was consistently perceived
to be associated with profile owners' extroversion. This asso-
ciation was accurate: profile owners who scored higher on HO
were indeed more extraverted. Study 2 confirmed these results
by demonstrating that self-reported humor production (Thorson
& Powell, 1993) was associated with extroversion but not
associated with college or high school GPA, overall ACT
scores, and verbal scores on the ACT. The lack of a humor­
intelligence association supports past courtship research (e.g.,
Bressler & Balshine, 2006; Lundy et al., 1998; Senko & Fyffe,
2010) and is consistent with Martin's (1998) systematic review
of the literature; humor production is not associated with intel-
ligence but is related to extroversion.
The sexual selection argument predicted sex differences in
humor production and humor appreciation in courtship con-
texts (Kaufman et al., 2008; Miller, 2000). Study 1 found no
sex difference in self-reported HO (i.e., the ability to create
humor) or the four indicators of humor production in users'
Facebook profiles. Study 2 found no sex difference in humor
production, humor appreciation, and two measures of humor
comprehension. Despite the argument that males should
Hall 7
possess a more skillful ability to produce humor and females a
more skillful ability to comprehend humor, no such differences
appeared in self-report measures.
The present investigation also explored associations among
humor production, humor appreciation, and mate value. Study
2 failed to find the predicted negative relationship between
humor appreciation and mate value in females (Kaufman
et al., 2008). Rather it revealed a positive association with
self-reported warmth and passion in a romantic relationship,
which supports prior research that being responsive to humor is
a sign of warmth and relational connection (Li et al., 2009;
Owren & Bachorowski, 2003). Females who were selective
and choosey in humor comprehension were introverted and
disagreeable in personality, which suggests that humor com-
prehension without appreciation (i.e., being very choosy) might
adversely serve a female wishing to attract a partner. This
evidence directly runs against the argument that a discerning
comprehension of humor would be to females' advantage in the
mating market.
Study 3 found that males who produced more humor con-
versed with females who were more interested in dating. Yet,
there was no support for the argument that females who showed
more humor appreciation would have lower mate value com-
pared to females who show less humor appreciation. Rather,
males' dating interest in females was unrelated to females'
humor appreciation. The portion of males' attempts at humor
laughed at by females was also unrelated to dating interest. It
was not the case that very selective (i.e., laugh at few or no
attempts) or very appreciative females (i.e., laughed at all
attempts) had higher or lower mate value from the perspective
of males.
Alternative Explanations
Two hypotheses were supported, but only in Study 3: females
appreciated males' humor more than males appreciated
females' humor, and females who appreciated males' attempts
at humor were more interested in dating than males who appre-
ciated females' attempts at humor. All other hypotheses drawn
from the humor production as intelligence argument were not
supported across all three studies. Are there alternative expla-
nations of the results?
Consistent with past reviews of research (e.g., Martin,
1998), the present research suggests that humor production is
strongly associated with extroversion, and perceptually associ-
ated with extroversion and warmth. The production of humor
may not be a reliable indicator of intelligence, but it might be
an indicator of these other desirable traits. Displaying social
facility and warmth through humor production may be a useful
mating strategy because those traits are highly valued by both
sexes (Kenrick, Groth, Trost, & Sadalla, 1993), particularly for
long-term relationships (Didonato, Bedminster, & Machel,
2013).
The present investigation failed to find sex differences in
humor production (Study 1­3), and only found a sex difference
in humor appreciation in face-to-face interactions between
opposite-sex, heterosexual strangers (Study 3). Consistent with
past research (e.g., Mehu & Dunbar, 2008; Provine, 1993),
females laughed at male speakers more than males laughed at
female speakers. More laughter by females, however, does not
appear to be a result of more humor production by males.
Compared to producing humor, ``laughter is involuntary and
hard to fake, providing an uncensored, honest account about
what people really think about each other'' (Provine, 2012,
p. 55). A man might actively attempt to make a woman laugh
not because his humor is an honest signal of his intelligence,
but because her response is honest signal of her liking (see also
Li et al., 2009). The sex difference in laughing in mixed sex
interactions may be a product of strategic attempts by a male to
get a female to reveal the degree to which she is attracted or
interested. During courtship, females often evaluate the degree
to which males are likeable, and males try to engender that
likeability through humorous banter or behavior, but not neces-
sarily through making comments or telling stories that are
objectively funny (Provine, 1993). The results of the present
investigation suggest that this strategy may indeed be quite
effective--more humor production by males is associated with
female partners' dating interest, and females' laughter in
response to males' humor attempts is an indicator of females'
dating interest.
The final explanation for the results of the present investi-
gation treats sharing humor as valuable in its own right, not for
what it signals or reveals. Mutual laughter was associated with
both male and female dating interest--although more strongly
so for females--echoing the results of Grammer and Eibl-
Eibesfeldt (1990) who used a design similar to Study 3. A
general sense of humor (i.e., loves to laugh) is both offered
by and requested in a romantic partner of both sexes (Wilbur
& Campbell, 2011). In long-term romantic relationships, Hall's
(2013) mediation analyses between humor style and relation-
ship satisfaction suggested that the primary value of humor in
relationships is its ability to share positive emotions or to
amuse oneself and one's partner through laughter and good
cheer. Therefore, sharing humor may function in a manner very
similar to having an agreeable and warm personality yielding a
higher probability of relationship success. Kenrick et al. (1993)
argues that a tendency to choose partners who were ``easy to
get along with, then, would have been adaptive to the extent
that it would have resulted in higher probabilities of pair per-
manence and offspring survival'' (p. 966). Hall (2013) suggests
that humor ``is prized during mate selection and valued in
romantic partners because a good sense of humor signals that
future interactions with this person are likely to be easier and
will include more laughter and fun'' (p. 288). The present study
found that mutual laughter was particularly important for pre-
dicting dating interest, which suggests that shared laughter
might be a pathway toward developing a more long-lasting
relationship.
One challenge to the present investigation is the lack of
sufficient measurement of humor comprehension. Although
Study 2 explored sex differences in comprehension through
self-report, Study 3 was unable to distinguish humor
8 Evolutionary Psychology
appreciation from humor comprehension through observation
of behavior. Simply, people laugh at jokes they do not fully
comprehend and comprehend jokes they do not laugh at. There-
fore, laughter, even in response to jokes, is not a clear indicator
of true appreciation (i.e., it was really funny) or comprehension
(i.e., I really got the joke). Instead, laughter--by speaker and
audience alike--signals playfulness, a lack of seriousness, con-
firmation, or irony (Owren & Bachorowski, 2003; Storey,
2003). It is even questionable whether individuals can distin-
guish why they laugh when they do. Individuals are not able to
control true laughter; laughing takes much longer to produce
than a simulated ha-ha response, suggesting it is under weak
voluntary control (Provine, 2012).
The present investigation suggests that sex differences in
humor appreciation are most likely to occur when measured
by responsive laughing during face-to-face, opposite-sex inter-
actions (Study 3), rather than by self-report (Study 2). Perhaps
during the first stages of courtship, attempts at humor by males
and laughter by females are part of a culturally informed court-
ship script. Masculinity and femininity are associated with a
husbands-joke and wives-laugh sex difference in more tradi-
tional marriages (Honeycutt & Brown, 1998). Humor produc-
tion during courtship could be interpreted as a sign of
dominance and laughter in response to a sign of submissiveness
(Owren & Bachorowski, 2003; Weiss et al., 2011). Accounting
for gender (i.e., masculinity/femininity) or gender ideology
(e.g., ambivalent sexism) within individuals might better
account for this particular sex difference during courtship. In
as much that some females prefer more masculine males and
some males prefer more feminine females, they may display
and reinforce humor behaviors (i.e., production by males;
laughter by females) to fit those gender roles. Perhaps flirting
by joking around by males is particularly attractive to tradi-
tional females, and females serving as a responsive audience
are most attractive to traditional males.
