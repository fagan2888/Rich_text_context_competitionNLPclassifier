Introduction
This article revisits the concepts of balance and impartiality in journalism, in the context
of a quantitative content analysis of sourcing patterns in BBC news programming on
radio, television and online in 2007 and 2012.1 Impartiality is the cornerstone of princi-
ples of public service broadcasting at the BBC and other broadcasters modelled on it.
However, the article suggests that in the case of the BBC, it is principally put into prac-
tice through the paradigm of impartiality as party-political balance: It is achieved by
juxtaposing the positions of the two main political parties ­ Conservative and Labour ­
to the detriment of a broader range of opinion. This is the case despite the news organisa-
tion's commitment to representing a broader range of opinion.
The article explores (a) the relationship between the dominance of elite sources and
(b) a narrowing range of views and information on contentious issues and (c) an over-
representation of Conservative voices. Our findings point to (d) the difficulties of mov-
ing beyond impartiality-as-balance in the context of a politically exposed public service
broadcaster. This is demonstrated through an examination of sourcing patterns in BBC
coverage of three complex and contentious issues ­ immigration, religion and Britain's
relationship to Europe.
We use the idea of a paradigm here in the sense developed by Kuhn (1962) and adapted
by journalism scholars. Kuhn (1970: 42) introduced the concept of the paradigm in his
work on the structure of scientific revolutions. He traced the patterns of practice and
enquiry through which scientific communities define themselves and perpetuate their
existence and their approach to major problems. This includes a set of shared preconcep-
tions that underpin and shape the collection of empirical evidence, coalescing into patterns
or models which overdetermine certain modes of inquiry, while excluding others. Here, we
use the idea of the paradigm as it has been deployed by journalism scholars; as a model:
[That] guides those engaged in complex information-producing tasks; it focuses attention on
some problems and necessarily excludes others that cannot be as easily stated using the tools
supplied by the paradigm. To make sense of the world, journalists, like scientists, rely on a
paradigm, which remains of value so long as it provides a useful practical guide for them and
they share its underlying assumptions. (Reese, 1990: 391)
In journalism studies, the concept has been primarily deployed to describe the adherence
of professional cultures to the `paradigm of objectivity' (e.g. Berkowitz, 2000; Hackett,
1984; Mindich, 2000) although some have also used it to describe `challenger paradigms'
such as alternative or deliberative models of journalism (Hackett, 2011; Robie, 2013). The
Wahl-Jorgensen et al. 783
term is helpful in emphasising the discursively constituted presumptions that shape practice
within professional communities (see Vogel, 2009). In the case of journalism, paradigms are
made and maintained through the discursive practice of journalists as they go about their
reporting and story-telling, organisational rituals and routines (e.g. Tuchman, 1972), as well
as in discussions the profession has about itself. Through such practices, discourses and
institutions, journalistic paradigms are contested, defended and repaired, highlighting the
role of journalism as an essentially defensive profession that constantly justifies its authority
in constructing our collective truths (e.g. Carlson and Lewis, 2015). David Mindich (2000:
7) discussed the idea of balance as a paradigm for objective journalism. He cited the `see-
saw' metaphor for journalism as having shaped journalism practice throughout the 20th
century, with frequent references to covering `both sides'of an issue in discussions of objec-
tivity and impartiality. This metaphor of the seesaw is also, as we shall see, explicitly used
in the BBC's own critical engagement with impartiality.
Theorising impartiality and balance
The idea of impartiality is central to the tenets of public service broadcasters around the
world (e.g. Flood et al., 2011) and has been particularly important to the BBC. It is writ-
ten into the Royal Charter which governs the BBC and guarantees its independence (e.g.
Starkey, 2007: xix). According to Helen Boaden (2010), the former director of BBC
news, and current director of BBC radio, `impartiality is in our DNA ­ it's part of the
BBC's genetic make-up'. Impartiality has been taken to mean that coverage should be
unbiased, balanced, objective, open-minded and avoid favouring one side over another
(Cushion, 2011: 33). While impartiality is related to the professional practices and ideals
of balance and objectivity, it is also a distinct concept:
[Impartiality] is to be distinguished from balance (the allocation of equal space to opposing
views) and objectivity (by which journalists usually mean an effort to exclude subjective
judgement). Impartiality involves no more than the attempt to regard different ideas, opinions,
interests or individuals with detachment. (Cox, 2007, cited in Sambrook, 2012: 5)
Ensuring impartiality, then, ideally entails the provision of a broad view of the range
and weight of opinion on a particular topic. It means that journalists play an active role in
constructing the narrative surrounding the range of opinion on a particular topic, as they
seek to reflect the diversity of the public(s) they represent, while at the same time attempt-
ing to `bind the nation and nurture a collective climate of rational opinion formation'
(Hendy, 2013: 38). Reporters who aim to be impartial should `take account of (i) a full
range of views and opinions; (ii) the relative weight of opinion...; and (iii) changes that
occur in the range and weight of opinion over time' (Hartley, 1992: 145). This definition
demonstrates that an impartial approach requires a complex set of professional assess-
ments. This is also reflected in the BBC's editorial guidelines, which state a commitment
to reflecting a
breadth and diversity of opinion across our output as a whole, over an appropriate period, so
that no significant strand of thought is knowingly unreflected or under-represented. We will be
784 Journalism 18(7)
fair and open-minded when examining evidence and weighing material acts. (British
Broadcasting Corporation, 2014)
Together, these statements highlight how, given the time and space constraints of broad-
casting, decisions about which voices and positions to represent necessarily involves
selectivity and significant curatorial responsibility on behalf of the journalist (see also
Engelbert and McCurdy, 2012). It also entails a careful judgement of the different articu-
lations of impartiality across genre and content types, including distinctions between
domestic and international content (e.g. BBC Trust, 2012: 12­13). Implicit in these con-
ceptions is a belief that, just as journalists have a `gut feeling' for news (Schultz, 2007),
they also have specially developed skills for picking up the range of views and voices on
a particular issue, and an empirical approach to `examining evidence and weighing mate-
rial acts'. This, however, is contradicted by research which suggests that journalism is
largely an oral culture which relies on evidence gathered in face-to-face conversations
with like-minded peers and friends, and takes such views to be representative of the
broader public, when in fact they are often skewed by the assumptions of insider cultures
(e.g. King and Schudson, 1995; Sumpter, 2000).
The BBC ­ along with other public service broadcasters ­ has been acutely aware of
these issues and has strict editorial guidelines concerning the coverage of controversial
issues and the inclusion of a range of views and voices (BBC, 2014). It has a tradition of
being highly self-critical in examining its own editorial policy and content. The BBC is
politically exposed because much of its funding comes from licence-fee income, directly
paid by its audience. It is a frequent target for critics of the licence fee. These include
voices in the right-wing press (e.g. Aitken, 2013), as well as right-leaning lobbying
groups and think tanks such as the Conservative Party-funded Civitas and Newswatch,
an organisation whose main aim it is to check the `BBC for EU bias' (http://news-watch.
co.uk/, accessed 14 July 2014).
As a result, the BBC routinely reviews its programming, with a particular interest in
its application of principles of impartiality. Since 2007, the BBC Trust has commissioned
a series of impartiality reviews examining the broadcaster's coverage of a range of
issues, including business and economics coverage, science, arts, rural affairs, the Arab
Spring and the four nations in the United Kingdom. It is in this spirit that the Bridcut
Review ­ a review designed to assess the state of impartiality more broadly ­ was carried
out for the BBC Trust in 2007. It followed on from calls to rethink the concept in a more
inclusive fashion. For example, in 2006, the Director of BBC Global News, Peter
Horrocks, introduced the idea of `radical impartiality', in stressing `the need to hear the
widest range of views ­ all sides of the story' to ensure that members of the public feel
respected and represented in news coverage (Horrocks, 2006).
Horrocks' position reflected a broader concern with the prevailing paradigm through
which impartiality is practised, based on the recognition that it has tended to result in the
representation of a limited range of views and voices. The Bridcut Review expanded on this,
and suggested what would amount to a contestation of the paradigm of impartiality-as-bal-
ance: Lord Bridcut suggested that we need to include more than two sides to an argument,
moving on from a `seesaw'model, where impartiality was understood as the representation
of polar opposites. Instead, he proposed a `wagon wheel'model of impartiality:
Wahl-Jorgensen et al. 785
Impartiality today requires a greater subtlety in covering and counterpointing the varied shades
of opinion ­ and arguably always should have done. Whereas opinion used to be balanced in
simple alternatives ­ and could be measured in tilts of the seesaw or swings of the pendulum
­ nowadays a more appropriate metaphor might be the many spokes of the wagon wheel ...
One opinion is not necessarily the exact opposite of another, nor do they all reach the extremity
of available argument. (BBC Trust, 2007)
The recommendations of the Bridcut Review were subsequently incorporated into the
BBC editorial policy. The data used in this article were originally commissioned as part
of the BBC Trust's impartiality review on the breadth of opinion ­ one of a series of regu-
lar reviews of the broadcaster's performance (Wahl-Jorgensen et al., 2013). What we
were asked to investigate was whether this editorial policy change and commitment to a
new understanding of impartiality had actually translated into practice between 2007 and
2012. Concretely, we were asked to study whether there has been a shift away from what
the Bridcut review referred to as a `seesaw' and towards a `wagon wheel' model of
impartiality, as evidenced through the presence of a broader range of opinion and voices
in their broadcasting on contentious issues.
This article draws on the data gathered for this research project, using it as a case
study of a high-profile news organisation trying to move towards the representation of a
greater breadth of opinion. The article will chart some of the systemic difficulties of
doing so, and thereby demonstrate broader limitations around how ideals of impartiality
are put into practice. In particular, as the article will suggest, impartiality has tended to
be understood and practised with reference to creating `balance' by giving equal time to
opposing political views (Maras, 2013: 61) ­ what we refer to as the paradigm of impar-
tiality-as-balance. What this means, in practice, is that if a journalist uses a politician
from the governing political party as a source for a story, they are also required to quote
a member of the opposition party to avoid the appearance of bias on the issue. Similarly,
if journalists are covering a controversial issue, it is customary to quote at least two
opposing viewpoints. This is problematic in terms of the epistemology of journalism or
the system through which its claims to knowledge are made, because it may be that not
all sides are equal, or there are more than two sides to a story (Boyce, 2007; Starkey,
2007: xix). It steers journalistic story-telling in the direction of conflict and controversy,
when in fact there may be a consensus ­ as in the case of coverage of scientific debates
such as that over climate change, or the safety of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella
(MMR) vaccine (see also Starkey, 2007: 38). What we here refer to as the paradigm of
impartiality-as-balance has been criticised for simplifying the political spectrum and nar-
rowing the range of views on contentious topics ­ a position also reflected in the Bridcut
Report's (BBC Trust, 2007) metaphor of the wagon wheel.
As this article will demonstrate, the paradigm of impartiality-as-balance has the con-
sequence of reinforcing an institutionalised preference for official and elite sources. This
is not a new finding, but one which is well-established in the literature on journalistic
sourcing, starting with Gans' (1979) classical newsroom sociology study, Deciding
What's News, which showed that `Knowns' (political, social and economic elites) appear
four times as often in the news as `Unknowns' (ordinary people; including victims and
protesters). This pattern of elite dominance has been confirmed in subsequent research.
786 Journalism 18(7)
Because journalists overwhelmingly rely on the voices of elites (e.g. Manning, 2001),
they have a disproportionate influence on the media agenda (Reese, 1990), acting as the
`primary definers' who set the framework of interpretation against which all subsequent
voices are forced to insert themselves (Hall et al., 1978). By contrast, ordinary people
who appear in the news are constructed primarily as passive consumers, reacting to the
agendas set by these elites (Lewis et al., 2005). This means that journalism reproduces
the power structure of the society (e.g. Berkowitz, 2009: 109; Carlson and Franklin,
2011: 1). As Charles Hendy (2013) pointed out, being `detached avoids overt partisan-
ship; but it can also end up with a narrow range of voices conveying establishment val-
ues' (p. 30). The systematic over-representation of elite views, and their central role in
the media agenda, is a particularly salient concern for a public service broadcaster like
the BBC, which is committed to reflecting not just the activities and views of elites, but
of the society as whole.
This study, then, examines how a major news organisation committed to representing
a broad range of views has sought ­ and ultimately failed ­ to address the systemic prob-
lems brought about by the paradigm of impartiality-as-balance. More concretely, the
article establishes (a) the relationship between the dominance of elite sources and (b) a
narrowing range of views and information on contentious issues and (c) an over-repre-
sentation of Conservative voices. Our findings point to (d) the difficulties of moving
beyond impartiality-as-balance in the context of a politically exposed public service
broadcaster.
Methodology
This article is based on a quantitative content analysis of hundreds of news items and
thousands of sources, comparing the breadth of opinion of the BBC coverage in 2007
and 2012. Content analysis is commonly used as a method for examining journalistic
sources (e.g. Riff et al., 2014: 1), as it enables researchers to generate quantitative data
describing larger samples. The content analysis reported here focuses on sourcing pat-
terns in the coverage of three topics: immigration, religion in the United Kingdom and
UK's relationship to Europe, in October and November 2007 and 2012, examining a
range of news and current affairs programming, as well as online stories from the BBC
News website. The three topics were selected in consultation with the BBC Trust. While
this article does not engage with the substance of these topics in detail, it is worthwhile
noting that these are particularly interesting as examples of complex and contentious
issues which, in the view of the BBC itself, require the representation of a broad range of
opinions (see also BBC Trust, 2007: 7). This is necessary to adequately represent the
diversity of viewpoints ­ particularly significant on the most controversial of issues but
a broader priority for the BBC as discussed above.
To investigate any changes in the breadth of opinion over time, we studied weekday
coverage of these topics over a month-long period between 15 October and 15 November
in 2007 and 2012, respectively. Our research team examined thousands of news reports on
television and radio, but coded only stories relevant to the three topics of religion, immigra-
tion and Britain's relationship to Europe. Over the sample period, we identified a total of
254 stories on these topics on broadcast platforms, out of which 85 appeared on television
Wahl-Jorgensen et al. 787
programmes and 169 on radio. Furthermore, we identified 246 relevant online stories from
the BBC News website. Altogether, the study reported here is based on the analysis of 500
stories. Our coding scheme for this study was constructed to provide a quantitative descrip-
tion of whose voices were heard. The detailed examination of source types allowed us to
investigate whether the range of voices has shifted between 2007 and 2012. We examined
up to 16 sources in each story, for a total of 2165 sources in the sample overall.2 Although
the story was the unit of analysis, this was essentially a sourcing study, allowing for a
detailed picture of sources, including an examination of what types of actors they were and
their political orientation.3 This approach enabled us to measure the diversity of sources,
which gives some indication of whether programming included a range of voices ­ incor-
porating a `wagon wheel' rather than a `seesaw' approach. However, a diversity of voices
does not necessarily translate directly into a diversity of views, and to help us assess the
latter, we also carried out qualitative examinations of selected content. Further, we coded
for duration of direct quotations from sources in broadcasts, as well as word counts for
online content.4 Coding was carried out by a team of 10 experienced coders. The coding
scheme was extensively piloted prior to the conduct of the content analysis by the research
team. While many of the measures were adapted from previous studies (including impar-
tiality reviews), our source type variables were refined specifically for this study through
the piloting process. Intercoder reliability tests were carried out on 5 percent of the sample
by two reliability coders who were part of the research team, using intercoder agreement as
the measure. For all variables discussed here, the tests resulted in agreement above 80 per-
cent.5 The study discussed in this article is one of two that we carried out as part of the
impartiality review.Asecond study examined routine coverage over the same time periods,
comparing BBC with its main terrestrial broadcaster competitors, Independent Television
(ITV) and Channel 4 and is briefly referenced later in the article.
On television, we examined BBC News at Ten (BBC One), BBC Breakfast 7­8 a.m.
(BBC One) and Newsnight (BBC Two). On radio, we coded the Today programme from 7
to 8.30 a.m. (Radio 4), Newsbeat at 12.45 p.m. (Radio 1), and 5 Live Breakfast, Your Call
9­10 a.m. (Radio 5 Live). The sample was chosen, first of all, to include a mixture of broad-
cast and online coverages. Second, we wanted to measure the breadth of opinion across a
range of programming, including flagship programmes such as the Today programme,
Newsnight and BBC News at Ten, as well as `softer' news programmes such as BBC
Breakfast and audience participation on Your Call. The following table displays the number
of stories focusing on these topics across the programmes and platforms that we coded.
As Table 1 demonstrates, online coverage on the three topics accounted for the largest
number of stories in the sample. This is not surprising given that there are fewer con-
straints on space and quantity of reports in the online environment. The second-most
prominent programme was Today, Radio 4's flagship morning news programme. This
may be explained by the length of the programme coded in the study ­ an hour and a half
a day, compared to 30 minutes to an hour for most of the other programmes. But it also
relates to the programme format, featuring a large number of different stories, compared
to Newsnight ­ the only other BBC programme of comparable length ­ which provides
in-depth coverage of a few stories.
Our sample inevitably delivers `snapshots' that provide a partial view of the breadth
of opinion in BBC programming. First, the sample represents a fraction of news and

current affairs programming, and second, it does so over a limited and specific period of
time. Although we deliberately selected time frames that avoided major news events
(e.g. elections, disasters and scandals) which might have skewed the sample, it is none-
theless inevitable that certain stories and sources were particularly prominent, while oth-
ers might be entirely absent. While our findings may not represent the exact distribution
of sources and stories in the BBC news provision in general, they are an accurate reflec-
tion of what occurred in this particular time span in coverage of the selected topic, and
indicative of broader patterns.
Findings
Overall, our findings demonstrate little change between 2007 and 2012, highlighting the
continued predominance of an understanding of impartiality in terms of balancing oppos-
ing party-political voices. Relating to this, our research shows a focus on party-political
infighting rather than the substance or context of these issues. Across the three topics, the
number of stories breaks down as follows (Table 2).
There was a larger number of stories on religion and immigration in 2007 than in 2012,
while the European Union (EU) appeared to be a more salient topic in 2012 than it was in
2007, and accounted for the most stories overall ­ just over two-fifths of our entire sam-
ple. This distribution of stories does not necessarily indicate a shift in the editorial

priorities of the BBC, but rather reflects the prominence of specific news events during
the sample period which related to the three topics. So, for example, during October and
November 2007, the Lisbon Treaty was being negotiated and political infighting among
Labour and Conservative parties was central to the news agenda, and therefore featured in
many of the stories about the UK's relationship to the EU. During the same period, ques-
tions around the relationship between Radical Islam and terrorism were prominent in the
religion sample. In 2012, by contrast, the most salient news events in the EU sample
included tensions between the two main parties in discussions over the EU budget, while
a large number of the religion stories focused on debates within the Church of England
over the appointment of the new Archbishop of Canterbury. In our immigration sample,
the most prominent sets of stories in each of the 2 years focused once again on political
infighting ­ in 2007, over the employment of illegal immigrants at the Home Office, and
in 2012, over the backlog in the processes of asylum cases. These were framed in terms of
tensions between the two main parties. The over-riding impression left by the coverage is
that what matters in mediated discussions over immigration, religion and the EU is not the
broader social, political and cultural debates regarding these issues, but rather the ways in
which they articulate and dramatise the perpetual battle between the two main parties.
Table 3 shows the overall distribution of source types across the sample in each of the
2 years.
The most striking finding was the dominance of political sources: they accounted for
almost half of all source appearances in 2007 and more than half in 2012. On the topic of
Britain's relationship to Europe alone, political sources accounted for more than three in
five (65%) of source appearances in 2007, and four in five (79.2%) in 2012. They were
used almost 10 times as frequently as the second-largest source category ­ media and

journalist sources. The EU is frequently constructed as a remote and elite-focused politi-
cal institution with little relevance to the public (Dahl, 1994; Garcia-Blanco and Wahl-
Jorgensen, 2013). There has long been discussions among scholars, pundits and officials
about the `democratic deficit' in the EU ­ or the extent to which the political union's
institutions fail to adequately represent its citizens (e.g. Ward, 2002). This bias is repro-
duced in the coverage, which focuses on debates between Eurosceptic and pro-European
political voices, largely from the two main parties.
The pattern of political source dominance indicates that far from adopting a new para-
digm of impartiality as a result of the Bridcut Review (BBC Trust, 2007) and editorial
policy change, the tendency towards an elite and relatively narrow range of debate only
intensified between the 2 years. This is perhaps not surprising in the light of the literature
on journalistic sourcing discussed above. Nor is it unique to the BBC: In a second study
carried out as part of the same review, where we examined national programming across
the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV, there was a general pattern of dominance of party-political
sources (Wahl-Jorgensen et al., 2013).6 But is a striking finding nonetheless, given the
official editorial commitment to a different approach. It demonstrates that the paradigm
of impartiality-as-balance is so ingrained within journalistic routines that it appears
impossible to overcome through top-down policy changes.
Media or journalist sources made up 7 percent of sources in both years; more than any
other profession aside from politicians. This number was primarily accounted for by the
use of BBC specialist correspondents or editors as commentators, and by references to
reports from other media. This reflects the rise of journalists used as experts ­ a trend
also discerned by other scholars (e.g. Barnhurst, 2015). This development has coincided
with, and is closely related to, the rise of interpretation in news journalism, particularly
in broadcast genres (Cushion, 2011).
It is also illustrative to consider the relative salience of different sources types. Our
study included up to 16 sources for each story. If we compare the presence of politicians
and members of the public in terms of their prominence within the stories, a clear pattern
emerges: whereas politicians account for 52.9 percent of the first eight sources, and
members of the public just 8.2 percent, the pattern for the last eight sources is very dif-
ferent. Here, political sources make up 42.1 percent, whereas members of the public
increase to 27.7 percent. This indicates that members of the public tend to appear much
later in news stories than official sources, rarely contributing to shaping the lens through
which news events are framed.
By contrast to politicians, members of the public were used as sources a total of 133
times in 2007 (11.4%), and 85 times in 2012 (8.5%). These often appeared late in a story,
as when a story on extremist claims in a mosque booklet included a quote from a worshipper
who said `I would be very surprised to hear that any kind of extremism or terrorist-related
activities were held in this mosque, it's not possible, it's a very open mosque' (http://news.
bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7068809.stm; accessed May 12, 2016).
As such, non-elite sources were not primarily setting the agenda for debate, but react-
ing to unfolding news events. This is consistent with research on media representations
of citizens which demonstrates that although ordinary people appear frequently in the
news, this does not mean that they frame public debate or provide new perspectives on
political issues (Lewis et al., 2005). Likewise, members of the public were far more
likely to feature in brief sound bites, with the vast majority of their appearances being
Wahl-Jorgensen et al. 791
1­10 seconds in length, whereas sound bites for political sources, as well as other author-
itative source types such as business owners, trade union leaders, academics, police and
journalists were most frequently 11­20 seconds long.
Political sources were much more likely than other source types to be featured in the
opening sections of news reports. This had the consequence of framing reports from
party-political perspectives which other sources then had to respond to ­ demonstrating
the power of political sources to serve as `primary definers'(Hall et al., 1978). If we look
in detail at the most frequently cited political source types, there is a clear pattern:
Westminster sources are by far the most prominent voices heard in BBC coverage, and
the incumbent government outranks the opposition, demonstrating the persistence of the
`Westminster bubble' (e.g. Deacon et al., 2006) and the advantages enjoyed by incum-
bents in broadcast coverage (Prior, 2006). This pattern contravenes the aim to go beyond
the realms of parliamentary politics articulated in the Bridcut review: `While continuing
a thorough and conscientious job of reporting both Houses of Parliament, and the other
democratic institutions within the UK, the BBC should not always feel beholden to the
parliamentary model' (British Broadcasting Corporation Trust, 2007: 35).
As a group ­ based on adding up all the references to sources in this category ­ gov-
ernment ministers and members of Cabinet topped the chart of source types. Among this
group, the most frequently quoted individual in 2007 was Foreign Secretary David
Miliband, who appeared 13 times (1.1%), whereas in 2012, Home Secretary Theresa
May accounted for 15 source citations (1.5%). The Prime Minister was the most impor-
tant individual source in both years, far outranking anyone else, even if the opposition
leader was also highly prominent across both years. This points to the increasing person-
alization and presidentialization of politics in the United Kingdom (Langer, 2011) and
demonstrates that it is more difficult for groups and individuals outside of the main
political parties to get a voice. But it also shows that the range and diversity of views
within each of the main political parties will tend to be under-represented, consistent
with political parties' strategy of centrally `controlling the message' (e.g. Gaber, 2013).
Table 4 below looks at the prevalence of particular political source types.

a
These include both direct speech sources, and ones that are quoted or referred to. The percentages are of
all sources in each year.
The table allows us to examine, first of all, how frequently the incumbent Prime
Minister and Leader of the Opposition were used as sources. In both years, the Prime
Minister was the most newsworthy single source: in 2007, Gordon Brown was quoted 46
times (3.9% of all sources in 2007) whereas in 2012, David Cameron made an appear-
ance 53 times (5.3% of sources in 2012). Opposition politicians were, perhaps not sur-
prisingly, less prominent than the incumbents. In 2007, there were an almost equal
number of references to `Conservatives' and `government' (28 and 26, or 2.4% and
2.2%). By contrast, in 2012, `government'was referred to 35 times (3.5%), and `Labour'
just 22 times (2.2%). The prevalence of sources representing the Shadow Cabinet and
Ministers went down from 3.9 percent of all sources under David Cameron's opposition
leadership in 2007 to 1.5 percent under Ed Miliband in 2012. This suggests that Cameron
was a more newsworthy opposition leader than Miliband, and that his government has
been more successful in attracting coverage than the preceding Labour government. This
may not be due to any bias on the part of the BBC, as David Cameron has widely been
characterised as a more compelling media persona than Labour leaders Gordon Brown
and Ed Miliband. Cameron has been seen as a new type of politician who has been spec-
tacularly successful in `generating external, individualized media meta-capital and, con-
sequently, achieving electoral success' (Davis and Seymour, 2010: 755). As Langer
(2010) points out, Cameron's success demonstrates that
The capacity to offer a `human' persona is often considered a prerequisite of political and
electoral success and a key marker of contemporary leadership potential. David Cameron's
popularity and Gordon Brown's woes in the opinion polls have often been discussed in these
terms, the former's heir-to-Blair youthful vitality and emotional openness contrasted favorably
to the detached and dour Brown. (p. 61)
The pattern of Conservative dominance was also highlighted in the analysis of ref-
erences to sources for which a political affiliation could be determined, as shown in
Table 5 below.
Wahl-Jorgensen et al. 793
As this table demonstrates, the Conservative Party has consistently accounted for
between two in five to almost half of all sources with clear political affiliations, whereas
Labour went down significantly between the 2 years ­ from almost half to just over a
quarter. The compelling persona of David Cameron notwithstanding, this offers some
evidence of editorial decision-making in favour of Conservative voices and views. As
our research on the coverage of Britain's relationship to Europe also demonstrated, there
was a tendency to over-represent Conservative and Eurosceptic views, whereas the case
for Europe was rarely heard in the BBC coverage (Berry, 2013). There may be several
reasons for the apparent pro-Conservative bias in BBC coverage on the topics we exam-
ined ­ a finding which flies in the face of criticisms of the BBC for its perceived left-
wing bias. After the publication of our report (Wahl-Jorgensen et al., 2013) which
occasioned significant public debate, the BBC's financial editor, Robert Peston, has been
one among several commentators backing up the findings on the basis of newsroom
experience. Following his delivery of the Charlie Wheeler lecture, he suggested that `the
BBC's routinely so anxious about being accused of being left-wing, it quite often veers
in what you might call a very pro-establishment, [a] rather right-wing direction, so that
it's not accused of that' (Sommers, 2014). He further argued that
[The] broadcaster had grown `completely obsessed' with following the news agenda set by
coverage of the right-wing papers such as The Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail. There's a
slightly `safety first' thing at the BBC ­ that if we think the Mail or the Telegraph is gonna lead
with it, then we should lead with it, `he said'. I happen to think that's mad. (Sommers, 2014)
These views are consistent with previous research on UK broadcasters' news agenda
(Hargreaves and Thomas, 2002) and were echoed in informal responses to our research
from other journalists, who argued that a bias towards Conservative sources may be
explained by the defensiveness of the BBC, caused by constant accusations of a left-
wing bias. As one anonymous BBC journalist put it in a Twitter Direct Message (DM)
responding to our research findings, `Four of the five BBC editors I worked for were
acutely conscious of the perception that the BBC is left wing and programmed to counter
it' (Anonymous, 14 February 2014). It points to a paradoxical and little recognised dan-
ger facing public service broadcasters which, like the BBC, are funded on a licence-fee
model: They are, in fact, highly politically exposed and subjected to far more scrutiny ­
particularly with respect to any perceived political bias ­ than commercial media
organisations.
Taken together, the two main parties accounted for almost nine in ten party-political
sources in 2007, going down to just over three in four in 2012. Other party affiliations
which appeared in much smaller numbers included Plaid Cymru, Democratic Unionist
Party (DUP), the British National Party (BNP), Sinn Fein, as well as Independents.
These, however, were almost absent from coverage on the three topics.7 The reasons why
the two main political parties so dominated coverage do not necessarily have much to do
with any deliberate neglect of minority voices, but more with the entrenched paradigm
of impartiality-as-balance, combined with an institutionalised understanding of the
794 Journalism 18(7)
newsworthiness of elite sources. The ways in which the paradigm limits the range of
views and sources presented on each story is helpfully illustrated by examining one
example in more detail ­ the story that contained the largest number of sources across the
2007 online sample on the topic of immigration, and therefore one that could be expected
to display a diverse range of voices. The story, `Migration "causes pressure in UK"'
(BBC News, 2007), published on 17 October 2007, was occasioned by the publication of
a report on the economic and social consequences of migration, and is interesting to
examine for the relative prominence given to particular sources and views.
The story opened with a brief summary of the report's findings and went on to cite the
statements of ministers on the `clear benefits' of migration to the British economy. It
subsequently discussed the findings of the report in more detail, based on the experiences
from different regions in the United Kingdom, some of them reporting concern about the
adverse effects of immigration on crime, health and education. The first directly quoted
source in the story was Immigration Minister Liam Byrne, who `said it was important to
"strike a new balance" in immigration policy':
"That means looking at the wider benefits to the British economy on the one hand, but it means
we have to take into account the wider impact on British public services and life as well."
The second source was Damian Green, shadow minister for immigration, who
expressed the need for migration quotas:
"We say of course you should look at the economics, at the effects on public services, on
demand for housing, school places and so on, and that then the government should set an
explicit limit every year," he said.
The pattern of according most prominence to a source representing government,
immediately followed by a member of the opposition holds true across our sample.
Subsequent sources in the story included Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah from the centre-
left Institute of Public Policy Research, providing an analytical perspective:
"It is clear that migration brings huge economic benefits to the UK," said Dr
Sriskandarajah.
"It is also clear that, although recent migration is presenting new challenges in areas
which have received large numbers of newcomers, most local communities around the
country are coping very well."
This position was counter-balanced by Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the anti-immi-
gration pressure group, Migrationwatch UK, who `said migration on the scale Britain
was currently facing was having a "huge impact" with "little economic justification"';
This example shows how sources were carefully balanced in reporting ­ but in such a
way that reporting presented each topic as one on which there were arguments for and
against, rather than a broader range of views. The non-party-political voices included
here to introduce a breadth of opinion come from think tanks ­ widely viewed as integral
parts of a `policy elite' (Smith, 1993) which are frequently directly linked to political
interests, rather than being the voices of an independent civil society (e.g. Dinan and
Miller, 2007).
Wahl-Jorgensen et al. 795
Despite the dominance of elite, party-political voices in flagship programming, there
was also some indication that online and phone-in platforms were more likely to include
non-elite voices, representing a broader range of views. For example, genres which
included audience participation ­ particularly the phone-in programme, Your Call and
online news ­ were more likely to include a broad range of sources, representing opin-
ions that were not heard elsewhere, including more extreme views. For example, in sto-
ries on religion, 23 members of the public appeared inYour Call and 40 online, accounting
for 70 percent of all instances where members of the public appeared in the religion
sample.8 However, just as there may be a hierarchy of access to the media, there is also
a hierarchy of platforms ­ as our research shows, `flagship'programmes or more prestig-
ious platforms are less likely to include a broader range of voices and views. It does,
nonetheless, suggest that alternative platforms and formats are more likely to enable a
`wagon wheel' approach to public debate.
Conclusion
This article has demonstrated the enduring force of the paradigm of impartiality-as-bal-
ance. In the selected coverage we examined between 2007 and 2012, the BBC failed to
change the paradigm ­ despite grand pronunciations in the Bridcut Report and good
intentions carried over into the editorial policy. Although the research presented here has
focused on the BBC, our second study which encompassed the other main terrestrial
broadcasters, ITV and Channel 4, showed that this limiting operationalisation of impar-
tiality is not unique to the BBC (Wahl-Jorgensen et al., 2013). The findings of this study,
then, raise larger questions about the difficulties of representing the range of opinion in
the context of public service broadcasting.
The consequences of the paradigm of impartiality-as-balance are manifold. First, it
means that only a narrow range of views and voices are heard on the most contentious
and important issues. Second, it results in reporting that focuses on party-political con-
flict, to the detriment of a journalism which provides much-needed context.
More than anything, our research demonstrates the power of professional paradigms
­ in this case, the paradigm of impartiality-as-balance. This may, of course, be particu-
larly exacerbated by the traditional and long-standing two-party dominance of British
politics, brought about by a first-past-the-post electoral system (e.g. Lipson, 1953).
Nonetheless, the pattern of valuing an understanding of objectivity as balance holds true
around the world (e.g. Berger, 2000), and is profoundly engrained in the everyday prac-
tice of journalists. There might be several reasons for the entrenched nature of this para-
digm. Manning (2001) argues that the `pressure of news deadlines and the importance of
obtaining information rich in news values, encourages a dependency upon official
sources' (p. 55). Also, journalists tend to `index' the range of competing viewpoints to
the intensity and duration of party-political conflicts (Bennett, 1994: 23). These practices
have made it possible for journalism to capture and construct the news, and are unlikely
to change unless the material circumstances of news production are profoundly trans-
formed. But it does have profound consequences for the epistemology of journalism,
insofar as the knowledge it produces is heavily structured by the reliance on opposing
and polarised viewpoints, rather than a broader range of positions.
796 Journalism 18(7)
Paradigms within cultures of practice cannot be easily changed from the top-down,
but rather must be transformed from the bottom-up. Such a shift is not easy to achieve in
journalism, particularly not in the unique ­ and highly politically charged ­ context
within which the BBC operates as a public service broadcaster. However, our research
also suggests that some types of content ­ including online news ­ contain a broader
range of news sources and views. This may point us to the ways in which the affordances
of emerging technologies enable new discursive formations that may ultimately chal-
lenge the paradigm of impartiality-as-balance because they provide novel ways of think-
ing about what constitutes news and its sources.

Notes
1. The content analysis was commissioned as part of the BBC Trust impartiality review and
focused on assessing the breadth of opinion in the light of the association's commitment to a
greater diversity of views in its programming.
2. It should be noted that we opted to study up to 16 sources per story, as this captured the
entirety of all sources cited in all but five of the stories analysed (the small number of excep-
tions included phone-in programmes). In cases where there were more than 16 sources, we
coded only the first 16 sources mentioned.
3. We also analysed sources in terms of a range of demographic variables, including gender,
age, ethnicity, religion and region, among many other things. Analysis of these has not been
included in this article for reasons of space.
4. Online coverage on the relevant topics was identified by doing keyword searches during the
sample period.
5. One variable (nationality of sources) was excluded from our reporting as a result of low inter-
coder reliability.
6. Please note that `national' programming here refers to news programmes distributed across
the United Kingdom on particular networks (BBC, ITV and Channel 4). In our report on
the research, we refer to such programmes as `network' programming to distinguish it from
`nations and regions'programming which is confined to particular nations and regions within
the United Kingdom.
7. The more frequent appearance of the Scottish National Party in 2012 relates to stories around
the party's proposal for Scotland's independence from the United Kingdom, and the conse-
quences for EU membership that might result. This news event was very prominent in our
online sample, but almost absent from television and radio coverage.
8. This statistic excludes the Today programme's Thought for the Day feature, which skewed the
sample given that it almost always used religious leaders as the main source.
