Introduction
In vivo scintigraphy remains the gold standard
technique for assessing lung deposition of inhaled
drugs.1,2 However, its use is limited by the
complex methodologies required to radiolabel
products and the fact that patients are exposed to
radiation during the procedure. A number of

Abstract
Background: Functional respiratory imaging (FRI) uses three-dimensional models of human lungs
and computational fluid dynamics to simulate functional changes within airways and predict the
deposition of inhaled drugs. This study used FRI to model the effects of different patient inhalation
and drug formulation factors on lung deposition of an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting 2
-agonist
(ICS/LABA) combination, administered by a pressurized metered-dose inhaler.
Methods: Three-dimensional models of the lungs of six patients with asthma (mean forced
expiratory volume in 1 s, 83%), treated with an ICS/LABA, were included. FRI modelling was
used to simulate (1) the effects on lung deposition of inhalation duration and particle size [fine
particle fraction (FPF), proportion of particles <5 µm; and mass median aerodynamic diameter
(MMAD), average size of inhalable particles]; (2) deposition of fluticasone propionate/formoterol
(FP/FORM) 125/5 µg; and (3) how inhalation profiles and flow rates affected FP/FORM deposition.
Results: Total lung depositions (TLDs) following 1-, 3- and 5-s inhalations were 22.8%, 36.1%
and 41.6% (metered dose), respectively, and central-to-peripheral deposition (C:P) ratios were
1.81, 0.86 and 0.61, respectively. TLD increased with increasing FPF, from ~8% at 10% FPF to
~36% at 40% FPF (metered dose); by contrast, MMAD had little effect on TLD, which was similar
across MMADs (1.5­4.5 µm) at each FPF. FP/FORM deposited throughout central and peripheral
airways with gradual (sinusoidal) and sharp (rapid) inhalations. TLD ranged from 35.8 to 44.0%
(metered dose) for gradual and sharp inhalations at 30 and 60 L/min mean flow rates.
Conclusions: These data provide important insights into the potential effects of inhalation
characteristics (inhalation profile and duration) and aerosol formulation (FPF) on lung
deposition of inhaled therapies. FRI thus represents a useful alternative to scintigraphy
techniques. Future FRI studies will further our understanding of the deposition of inhaled
drugs and help improve the management of asthma.

alternatives to scintigraphy are available that use
mathematical modelling to predict how a drug
will be delivered to and deposited in the airways.
These range from very basic empirical models
that reduce the anatomy of the repository tract to
just a few sections, through to highly detailed
models that use computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) to simulate particle motion and deposi-
tion in airways modelled on real human lungs.3,4
Although these models overcome the main issues
associated with scintigraphy, they cannot simu-
late certain key parameters, such as the exact
physiology of the human respiratory system and
the complexities of aerosol physics. Nevertheless,
they remain an important and validated tool for
researchers, providing a time- and cost-effective
means of predicting lung deposition under a
range of physiological conditions that may not
always be feasible to measure in vivo with
scintigraphy.
One such technique is functional respiratory
imaging (FRI), an advanced technology that
combines three-dimensional (3D) modelling of
human lungs [taken from computerized tomog-
raphy (CT) scans] with CFD, a branch of fluid
mechanics that uses numerical analyses and
algorithms to simulate the motion of fluids and
their interactions with surfaces. CFD is used in
many areas of research and design, such as in the
aviation, space and automotive industries, and is
increasingly being used in medical science (e.g.
in the study of blood flow in cardiovascular dis-
eases).5 In respiratory medicine, FRI simula-
tions, by combining CFD and 3D modelling
from CT scans of patients' lungs, can predict
how changes in patient-specific anatomy (e.g.
variations in disease progression or treatment)
can impact on functional outcomes in the lungs,
such as the deposition of inhaled drugs, or air-
way resistance.6­10
FRI allows precise manipulation of experimental
conditions, including patient factors, and device
and formulation characteristics, and therefore
allows investigations that would be difficult or
impossible with in vivo techniques. Furthermore,
multiple assessments with different drug formula-
tions can be made in the same patient's lungs,
thereby controlling for anatomical differences,
which would not be possible with in vivo scintig-
raphy owing to the need to limit exposure to radio-
actively labelled compounds. Patients would be
exposed to multiple doses of radiation with in vivo
lung scintigraphy (at least 2 mSv per exposure),
whereas a CT scan for FRI purposes results in a
radiation dose of 1­3 mSv (lower than a regular
chest CT scan of ~7 mSv).11
Correct inhaler technique is important to achieve
good asthma control.12 A study in patients with
asthma who were treated with inhaled corticos-
teroids (ICSs) administered via a pressurized
metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) showed that indi-
viduals with an inadequate inhaler technique had
less stable disease than those with a good tech-
nique.13 Patients are advised to inhale slowly and
deeply when using a pMDI. The European
Respiratory Society/International Society for
Aerosols in Medicine (ERS/ISAM) guidelines
recommend that patients should inhale for 4­5
s,14 which should reduce the inhalation flow rate
and allow more time to coordinate device actua-
tion and inhalation. Many patients, however,
inhale too quickly when using a pMDI.15 FRI
allows the extent to which differences in inhala-
tion duration and profile (e.g. different flow rates)
affect lung deposition to be evaluated in detail.
Formulation characteristics also affect lung depo-
sition. Studies have suggested that a given dose of
beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) delivered
via a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-based pMDI pro-
vides the same degree of asthma control as 2.5
times the BDP dose from a chlorofluorocarbon
(CFC)-based inhaler.16,17 This is typically attrib-
uted to the extrafine particle size formulation of
HFA-based BDP18 compared with the larger par-
ticles of the CFC-based formulation, with a mass
median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of
~1.3 µm or 4.3 µm, respectively. The two formu-
lations also differ in their fine particle fraction
(FPF; HFA-based BDP, 36%; CFC-based BDP,
18%), which could contribute to the observed
differences.18 The FPF is the proportion of the
total dose comprising particles with a diameter
smaller than 5.0 m, including those that deposit
in the `throat' of the apparatus; the calculation of
MMAD excludes these particles, which usually
constitute the majority of the total dose. FRI
allows the effects of variations in both MMAD
and FPF on lung deposition to be assessed
independently.
We used FRI to investigate how variations in
inhaler technique (such as inhalation duration and
profile) and formulation characteristics [such as
particle size (MMAD, FPF)] may influence the

Here,wereportfindingsfromtheffluid(Fluticasone
propionate/FormoteroL and improving our
UnderstandIng of lung Deposition) study, which,
to our knowledge, is the first study to use a series of
FRI simulations to assess the effect of each of these
patient and formulation factors independently on
the lung deposition of inhaled drugs, while keeping
all other factors constant. The study involved 3D
models of airways derived from six patients with
asthma. It used theoretical models to evaluate the
effects of inhalation duration and particle size
(MMAD and FPF) on total and regional lung dep-
osition for a representative pMDI. In addition, for
the first time, the study evaluated the total and
regional lung deposition of a real-world HFA-based
pMDI formulation of fluticasone propionate/for-
moterol fumarate (FP/FORM; Flutiform®) and
assessed how different inhalation profiles and flow
rates affected its deposition. Overall, the study was
designed to provide first theoretical insights into
the effects of specific formulation and patient char-
acteristics on the deposition of inhaled drugs in the
lungs, while keeping all other variables constant.
Methods
The methodology for FRI studies can be divided
into four stages: (1) patient scanning and 3D air-
way modelling; (2) determining inhaler charac-
teristics; (3) setting the inhalation profile; and (4)
modelling of lung deposition using CFD simula-
tions. All three of the sub-studies reported here
involved the same patient group and employed
similar CFD simulation strategies; inhaler
characteristics and inhalation profiles differed
between the sub-studies.
Patients and airway modelling
Volumetric, CT-based, 3D models of the lungs of
patients with asthma were used in the studies.
Patient CT scans were obtained retrospectively;
no active patient recruitment was performed for
this study. All patients gave their informed con-
sent and ethical approval was obtained from the
Ethics Committee of the University Hospital in
Antwerp. The respiratory tract was reconstructed
down to the level of the airways with a diameter of
1­2 mm, based on CT scans with a voxel size of
around 0.5 mm3. The airways further down-
stream of this could not be detected, so if the par-
ticle exited the 3D model, it was considered to be
deposited in the peripheral region. However, the
compliance in this region was taken into account
by calculating the internal airflow distribution
based on the lobar volume change from expira-
tion to inspiration. All participants had forced
expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1
) of 60­100% of
the predicted value and were receiving ICS/long-
acting 2
-agonist (LABA) therapy. Inspiratory
and expiratory scans were performed for each
participant to generate 3D models of the airways
and lungs. Inspiratory scans were used to create
patient-specific models of the upper and lower
airways, up to the point where no distinction
could be made between the intraluminal and
alveolar airways. An example of an inspiratory
scan from a single patient with asthma is shown in
Figure 1, where the extrathoracic region (mouth
and throat), the central (large) airways and the
peripheral (small) airways are depicted. Both
inspiratory and expiratory scans were used to pro-
duce models of the lung lobes.
All modelling operations were performed using
commercially available validated software pack-
ages (Mimics 15.0 and 3-Matic 7.0; Materialise
NV, Leuven, Belgium).
Inhaler characteristics
In order to evaluate the effect of specific inhaler
and patient characteristics on lung deposition, all
other variables associated with a representative
pMDI (including cone angle and spray velocity)
were kept constant during the simulations.
Characteristics relating to the aerosol plume were
based on measurements for a representative

model of the upper and lower airways, generated by

pMDI (FP/FORM) and included cone angle,
spray velocity and inhalation duration;19 the
MMAD (which excludes particles that impact on
the `throat' of the impactor) and FPF (which
includes particles that impact on the `throat' of
the impactor; calculated as a percentage of the
labelled dose) values varied depending on the
experimental conditions (see below for details).
The formulation characteristics (e.g. MMAD,
FPF, and plume velocity and duration) for the
marketed FP/FORM HFA-based pMDI were
based on its published attributes19,20 and its half
cone angle of 13°.
Influence of inhalation duration on lung
deposition
The first sub-study evaluated the effects of differ-
ent inhalation durations on modelled lung depo-
sition. Particle characteristics used were an
MMAD of approximately 3.0 m [geometric
standard deviation (GSD): 1.6] and an FPF of
approximately 40%, which were based on the
characteristics of FP/FORM (MMAD 3.2­3.5
µm; GSD 1.56­1.77; FPF 39.1­43.7%).19
Simulations were performed for three different
inhalation profiles with durations of 1, 3 and 5 s,
matched for the same inspiratory volume (3 L),
with actuation at the start of inhalation
(Supplementary Figure A). A sinusoidal inhala-
tion profile (similar to that of tidal breathing) was
employed because this is routinely used to model
breathing rhythms. pMDIs are recommended to
be inhaled over 4­5 s, in order to achieve a flow
rate of ~30 L/min and an inhalation volume of
~2.5 L; we therefore chose an inhalation duration
of 5 s to reflect this.14 Shorter inhalation dura-
tions of 1 and 3 s that are associated with faster
inhalation flow rates (and are executed by some
patients who use pMDIs) were also modelled.15,21
Mean flow rates were 180 L/min, 60 L/min and
36 L/min for the 1-, 3- and 5-s profiles, respec-
tively; peak flow rates for each profile were 343 L/
min (1 s), 114 L/min (3 s) and 69 L/min (5 s).
Influence of MMAD and FPF on lung deposition
The second sub-study assessed the effects of dif-
ferent MMAD and FPF values on modelled lung
deposition. The simulations were performed on
virtual monodisperse compounds using three
MMAD (± GSD) values (1.5 ± 1.2, 3.0 ± 1.2
and 4.5 ± 1.2) and four FPFs (40%, 30%, 20%
and 10%). A GSD of 1.2 was chosen because this
is typical of a monodisperse aerosol profile, such
as those evaluated in a previous clinical study.22
The profiles were developed by taking a standard
monodisperse profile and scaling down its FPF to
a set value, with a corresponding increase in the
proportion of large particles (>10 µm in diame-
ter); the distribution is scaled so that losses in the
pre-separator are taken into account. A sinusoidal
inhalation profile (similar to that of tidal breath-
ing that is often used as a typical breathing pat-
tern) of 30 L/min over 3 s was used for all CFD
simulations, with actuation timed as the start of
inhalation (the timing of which can impact drug
delivery in real life). An inhalation duration of 3 s
was chosen because many patients who use
pMDIs inhale too quickly21 (ERS/ISAM guide-
lines recommend that patients inhale over 4­5
s).14 We recognize that some patients inhale faster
at the start of inhalation, and so we also modelled
an inhalation profile to reflect this in a separate
part of the study (see the following paragraph), in
addition to modelling a longer inhalation dura-
tion to represent that recommended by ERS/
ISAM (5 s; see above).14 The simulation of other
complex variables (e.g. droplet entrainment,
evaporation, spray duration) was considered to be
beyond the scope of this initial study.
Influence of inhalation profile on lung
deposition of FP/FORM
The third sub-study evaluated the effects of dif-
ferent inhalation profiles on lung deposition of
FP/FORM administered via an HFA-based
pMDI; both the FP and FORM components of
this formulation have an FPF of approximately
40% of labelled dose and an MMAD of 3.2­3.5
µm (GSD 1.56­1.77).19 Models for the deposi-
tion of FP and FORM were modelled separately,
but deposition data are presented as a composite.
All deposition data are presented as a percentage
of the metered dose and are therefore valid for all
formulations. Simulations were performed with
two different inhalation profiles: a sharp inhala-
tion with peak flow shortly after the start [similar
to the forceful inhalation when using a pMDI
incorrectly and recommended when using a dry
powder inhaler (DPI)] and a gradual inhalation
with peak flow midway through the inhalation
(similar to the gradual inhalation recommended
when using a pMDI; Supplementary Figure B).14
Profiles were assessed using an inhalation dura-
tion of 3 s (as described above), with actuation at
the start of inhalation, at mean flow rates of 30 L/

min and 60 L/min. Peak flow values were 47 L/
min and 94 L/min for the gradual profile and 57
L/min and 114 L/min for the sharp profile at
mean flow rates of 30 L/min and 60 L/min,
respectively. The simulation of other complex
variables (e.g. droplet evaporation, spray dura-
tion, initial ballistic velocities) was considered to
be beyond the scope of this initial study.
CFD simulations
The 3D models of the respiratory tracts were sub-
divided into three regions (Figure 1): extratho-
racic (from the mouth to the trachea at the top of
the sternum), central (from the trachea to airways
reconstructed from CT data) and peripheral (air-
ways with a diameter of <2 mm, which were not
visible on CT scans). The combination of central
and peripheral regions was used to determine the
total amount of lung deposition.
Surface meshes were created in 3-Matic and were
converted to tetrahedral, 3D volume meshes
using TGrid 14.0 (Ansys Inc, Canonsburg, PA,
USA). CFD simulations were performed using
the 3D models and applying the following bound-
ary conditions: selected inhalation profiles were
applied at the inhaler inlet to account for device-
generated turbulence; the percentage of flow exit-
ing the model towards a lung lobe equalled the
relative lobar expansion, as obtained from patient-
specific inspiratory/expiratory 3D models; when a
particle hit the airway wall, it was assumed to be
trapped at that location; any particle not depos-
ited in extrathoracic or central airways was
assumed to be deposited in peripheral airways.
Although extrafine particles have a greater poten-
tial than larger particles to be exhaled, an in vivo
study using extrafine beclometasone dipropion-
ate/formoterol showed that only a very small frac-
tion (2­3%) of extrafine particles was exhaled
following a 10-s breath hold.23 This was most
likely due to the fact that extrafine particles
deposit by sedimentation, meaning the extent of
deposition of these particles is influenced by dura-
tion of breath hold: the longer the duration, the
greater the deposition of extrafine particles and
the lower the amount that can be exhaled. In this
study, owing to the limited resolution of the CT
scanner, particles depositing in bronchioles <1­2
mm in diameter could not be detected. Therefore,
our results model the effects of a breath hold that
is sufficient to allow deposition of particles in the
peripheral airways. Further studies are required
to fully explore the impact of breath hold on the
deposition of extrafine particles.
Temporal discretization was accomplished using
a second-order implicit formulation with a time
step of 0.005 s. A pressure-based solver was used
with a node-based Green­Gauss gradient treat-
ment and a SIMPLE (semi-implicit method for
pressure-linked equations) pressure­velocity cou-
pling. Large eddy simulations (LES) using the
kinetic-energy transport subgrid scale model were
performed, and LES near-wall treatment was
used. The spatial discretization options for pres-
sure, momentum and subgrid kinetic energy
were, respectively: standard, bounded central dif-
ferencing and second-order upwind. An aggrega-
tive algebraic multigrid solver was used in
combination with a Gauss­Seidel smoothing
algorithm. Particle transport was modelled by an
implicit Runge­Kutta Lagrangian discrete parti-
cle model, with one-way coupling of the forces
from the flow to the particle and taking into
account the Saffman lift forces. The aerosol
plume was modelled by additional species trans-
port equations for a compressible mixture.
Statistical analyses
All analyses were conducted using R version 3.2.5
(The R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria), using linear mixed-effect mod-
els with a random intercept for the subject.
Depending on the residual plots, the outcome
parameter was logarithmically transformed and
higher-order effects incorporated. To assess the
goodness of fit, marginal R2 values were calcu-
lated and p values obtained by comparing the
model with the null model using parametric boot-
strap with 1000 simulations. The estimate and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated
using parametric bootstrapping with 200 simula-
tions. Descriptive results are given as mean ±
standard deviation (SD); formal statistical predic-
tions are given as mean (95% CI).
Results
Patients
Imaging data from six patients with asthma were
assessed in the studies. All patients had stable dis-
ease, as defined by the Global Institute for Asthma
(GINA).24 A total of four females and two males
were included, with a mean (SD) age of 50 (18)
Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 12

years and a mean (SD) FEV1
of 83% (15%) of
predicted (Table 1). Mean FEV1
was 83% of the
predicted value (range, 60­93%) and mean FEV1
/
forced vital capacity (FVC) was 67% (range 61­
72%; Table 1).
Influence of inhalation duration on lung
deposition
Total lung deposition (TLD; defined as the pro-
portion of the formulation that reached the
intrathoracic region) increased with increasing
duration of inhalation, with mean ± SD values
for the 1-, 3- and 5-s inhalation profiles of 22.8%
± 3.7, 36.1% ± 2.5 and 41.6% ± 3.1 of the
metered dose, respectively (Figure 2; based on
raw data). The remaining proportion of the for-
mulation deposited in the extrathoracic region.
TLD could be predicted using a concave down
quadratic model (R2 = 0.87; p < 0.001; linear
model predictions), with mean (95% CI) values
of 22.8% (20.1%, 25.2%), 36.2% (33.7%,
38.3%) and 41.6% (39.3%, 34.8%) for the 1-,
3- and 5-s inhalation profiles, respectively.
The mean ± SD central-to-peripheral deposition
(C:P) ratios for the 1-, 3- and 5-s inhalation
profiles were 1.81 ± 1.12, 0.86 ± 0.39 and 0.61
± 0.30, respectively, indicating an increase in the
proportion of drug deposited peripherally with
longer inhalation duration (Figure 2). The natu-
ral log of the C:P ratio could be predicted using a
concave up quadratic model (R2 = 0.44; p <
0.001) and resulted in mean (95% CI) back-
transformed values of 1.57 (0.99, 2.36), 0.80
(0.50, 1.15) and 0.55 (0.37, 0.80) for the 1-, 3-
and 5-s inhalation profiles, respectively.
Influence of MMAD and FPF on lung deposition
Using FRI enabled the assessment of the effect of
different FPF values on TLD while keeping
MMAD constant, and vice versa. In the simula-
tions performed in this study, TLD improved
with increasing FPF values, whereas changes in
MMAD had little effect on TLD. At each FPF
value, TLD was similar for all three MMADs; for
example, at an FPF of 10%, mean ± SD TLD
was 8.5% ± 0.34, 8.1% ± 0.48 and 8.4% ± 0.81
for MMADs of 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 m, respectively,
and at an FPF of 40%, mean ± SD TLD was
34.4% ± 1.37, 32.5% ± 1.93 and 33.6 ± 3.25,
respectively (Figure 3). By contrast, mean ± SD
TLD was greater at higher FPFs, increasing from

8.1% ± 0.48 of the metered dose at an FPF of
10%, to 16.2 ± 0.97 at an FPF of 20%, 24.4% ±
1.45 at an FPF of 30% and 32.5% ± 1.93 at an
FPF of 40% for an MMAD of 3.0 m (Figure 3).
These trends were confirmed when using a
mixed-effects model to assess the influence of
FPF or MMAD on TLD; increasing FPF was
found to be significantly associated with increas-
ing TLD (p < 0.001), whereas MMAD was
found to have no effect on TLD (p = 0.30). When
averaged over the 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 m MMAD
values, the total linear model (R2 = 0.97; p <
0.001) resulted in mean (95% CI) values of 8.3%
(7.2%, 9.3%), 16.7% (15.5%, 17.6%), 25.0%
(23.8%, 26.0%) and 33.4% (32.2%, 34.4%) for
FPF values of 10, 20, 30 and 40%, respectively.
Interestingly, MMAD had an effect on regional
lung deposition (Table 2). For all FPFs tested,
mean ± SD C:P ratios were 0.43 ± 0.11, 0.74 ±
0.35 and 1.68 ± 1.07 for MMAD values of 1.5,
3.0 and 4.5 m, respectively, indicating an
increase in the proportion of central deposition
and a corresponding decrease in peripheral depo-
sition at higher MMADs (Table 2). The natural
log of the C:P ratios could be predicted using a
concave up quadratic model (R2 = 0.51; p <
0.001) and resulted in mean (95% CI) back-
transformed values of 0.42 (0.28, 0.58), 0.67
(0.44, 0.98) and 1.40 (0.90, 1.98) for MMAD
values of 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 m, respectively.
Regional lung deposition (C:P ratio) was not
influenced by FPF (p = 0.91).
Influence of inhalation profile on lung
deposition of FP/FORM
The influence of different inhalation profiles and
flow rates on lung deposition of FP/FORM was
assessed while keeping other patient factors, such
as inhalation duration, constant, thereby allowing
assessment of these factors independently. FP/
FORM deposited throughout central and periph-
eral airways, with both gradual and sharp inhala-
tion profiles (Figure 4). A gradual inhalation was
associated with a trend for higher TLD than a
sharp inhalation, and within each inhalation pro-
file, a flow rate of 30 L/min was associated with a
trend for higher TLD than a flow rate of 60 L/min.
For example, for FP, mean ± SD TLD with a
gradual inhalation profile was 44.0% ± 2.6 and
42.4% ± 2.9 at flow rates of 30 and 60 L/min,
respectively, and 39.7% ± 3.1 and 36.1% ± 2.5,
respectively with a sharp inhalation profile (Figure
4). In the mixed-effect model, inhalation flow rate
and flow profile were both found to have a signifi-
cant effect on TLD (p < 0.001). Averaged over FP
and FORM, the total linear model (R2 = 0.52, p <
0.001) resulted in mean (95% CI) TLD values of
44.3% (42.0%, 46.2%) and 41.7% (39.4%,
43.6%) for gradual inhalation profiles at flow rates
of 30 L/min and 60 L/min, respectively, and 39.1%
(36.8%, 41.0%) and 37.0% (34.4%, 38.5%),
respectively, for sharp inhalation profiles.
A greater proportion of peripheral deposition
was observed with the gradual inhalation

Discussion
Although mathematical modelling provides
researchers with a powerful tool for estimating the
deposition and distribution of an inhaled drug, a
key limitation is that these models are not able to
fully replicate the situation in real-life or in vivo
settings. For example, they cannot mimic the
complex physics associated with aerosol formula-
tions (e.g. the rapidly evaporating and decelerat-
ing propellant droplets emitted from pMDIs)25
and they do not account for important physiologi-
cal factors that can affect drug deposition, such as
airway humidity and surface features.3,4
In vivo scintigraphy is clearly the gold standard
for assessing lung deposition.1,2 Nevertheless,
FRI provides a valuable alternative to conducting
in vivo scintigraphy studies, because radiation
exposure is reduced, allowing multiple assess-
ments to be made in the same patient's lungs.
Importantly, data from FRI modelling studies
have been shown to correlate well with in vivo
data obtained using scintigraphy.7,23,26,27 For

example, lung deposition achieved with two FP/
salmeterol pMDIs (Evohaler® and a similar
inhaler developed by Cipla Ltd, Mumbai, India)
was 18% when assessed by FRI,27 compared with
16% when assessed by scintigraphy.26 Likewise,
lung deposition of beclomethasone dipropionate/
FORM pMDI was almost identical when assessed
by FRI (generated with the same algorithm as
used in the present study) and scintigraphy (30%
and 31%, respectively).7,23,26
FRI enables investigation of the effect that spe-
cific patient factors, and device and formulation
characteristics, have on lung deposition because
other variables can be kept constant. This means
that FRI can provide important theoretical
insights into the effects of some specific inhala-
tion characteristics (e.g. inhalation profile and
duration) and aerosol formulation characteristics
(e.g. FPF) on lung deposition of a modelled,
monodisperse particle distribution. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the
effect of specific formulation and patient charac-
teristics on lung deposition using FRI (while all
other factors are kept constant), and is the first to
assess the effect that some of these factors have on
the deposition of FP/FORM. Insights from this
study, together with future studies assessing more
complex particle-size distribution patterns, could
help in the management of patients with asthma
in everyday practice or in the development of new
devices and formulations for inhaled drugs.
Inhalation duration and lung deposition
For the first time, FRI allowed us to evaluate the
specific effects of inhalation duration on lung
deposition while matching for other patient fac-
tors such as inspiratory volume and inhalation
profile. Our findings provide useful data in sup-
port of ERS/ISAM guidelines, which recommend
a slow and deep inhalation lasting 4­5 s when
using a pMDI.14 A fast inhalation is the most
common handling error observed with a
pMDI.15,21 Many patients also find it difficult to
coordinate actuation of their pMDI with inhala-
tion, particularly if they inhale quickly;12,21
indeed, the requirement for a slow inhalation is
supported by a study in 18 patients with obstruc-
tive lung disease, in which a device in which a
laser aerosol photometer was combined with a
piston-type ventilator was used, allowing the sub-
ject to inhale particles at controlled breathing pat-
terns. A controlled, slow inhalation was shown to
provide significantly greater lung deposition than
a faster inhalation (100 cm3/s, 79%; 250 cm3/s,
70%; p = 0.01).28 Therefore, there is a clear logic
behind the guidelines: for patients who inhale too
rapidly with a pMDI, extending the inhalation
duration to 4­5 s would reduce the inhalation
flow rate (assuming the same inspiratory volume)
and thereby improve lung deposition. It should
also reduce the number of coordination errors,
because it allows more time for the patient to
coordinate pMDI actuation with inhalation.
The current study suggests that for the represent-
ative pMDI (FP/FORM) model used in these
simulations, an inhalation duration of 5 s (recom-
mended by ERS/ISAM guidelines14) leads to a
high level of lung deposition, with good levels of
peripheral and central deposition; however, our
results also showed that high levels of deposition
were achieved even with a 3-s inhalation (nearly
90% of that seen with a 5-s inhalation). This
implies that while the recommended 4­5-s inha-
lation should remain a goal for optimal deposi-
tion, this perhaps should not be treated as an
absolute cutoff value below which inhalation is
considered inadequate, and a shorter duration
should not necessarily be considered an error.
Notably, the formulation assessed in this study
suggests that modern pMDIs have the potential
to provide good deposition, even when peak flow
rates exceed 60 L/min (69 L/min and 114 L/min
for the 5-s and 3-s inhalations, respectively), a
flow rate previously suggested as being unsuitable
for pMDIs.21 Lung deposition with a 1-s, sharp
inhalation, however, was markedly lower than
with longer durations, delivering approximately
half the dose achieved with the 5-s inhalation.
Interestingly, central deposition was similar for all
three inhalation durations (approximately 15%),
whereas peripheral deposition was improved with
slower and longer inhalation. This suggests that,
while the speed and duration of inhalation may
make little difference to the efficacy of bronchodi-
lators (which act primarily in central airways),22 a
slower and longer inhalation may be an advantage
for anti-inflammatory agents (which should be
distributed throughout the central and peripheral
airways for optimal efficacy).29 This also raises
the question of whether this tenet applies to all
types of devices, including DPIs. It is reasonable
to assume that the same principles apply to all
particle types, and therefore that the fast and
forceful inhalation manoeuvre required to
C Van Holsbeke, J De Backer et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tar 11
deagglomerate the powder and generate respira-
ble particles with DPIs may limit the amount of
drug that can reach peripheral airways. Further
work should be conducted to assess whether this
is the case.
MMAD, FPF and lung deposition
The use of FRI allowed us to assess indepen-
dently the effects of MMAD and FPF on lung
deposition for a specific, monodisperse fraction.
A sinusoidal inhalation profile was used (similar
to that of tidal breathing that is often used to rep-
resent a typical breathing pattern), with actuation
timed as the start of inhalation (the timing of
which can impact drug delivery in real life).
However, we recognize that some patients inhale
faster at the start of inhalation, so we also mod-
elled a `sharp' inhalation profile to reflect this
when evaluating the lung deposition of FP/FORM
(discussed above). By modelling a formulation
that contained a monodisperse fraction with a
specified particle size as well as a proportion of
particles that were greater than 10 µm, we could
alter MMAD and FPF separately. This enabled
us to assess the impact of each of these parame-
ters on TLD ­ which would be difficult to achieve
with real-world formulations. Our findings
showed that FPF had a large impact on TLD,
whereas MMAD had little effect at the same FPF.
There was a linear increase in TLD with increas-
ing FPF (R2 = 0.97, p < 0.001), whereas TLD
was similar across all three MMADs (1.5, 3.0 and
4.5 µm) at each specific FPF value (p = 0.30).
The reasons underlying this observation are not
fully elucidated. However, it is important to note
that the calculation for FPF includes all particles
with a diameter <5.0 m, including those that
deposit in the `throat' of the impactor. By con-
trast, MMAD excludes particles that impact on
the `throat', which usually constitute the majority
of the total dose. The effect of other particle dis-
tributions on these parameters is unknown.
Previous studies have suggested that aerosols
containing extrafine particles provide greater
lung deposition than those with larger particles;
indeed, as noted in the Introduction, this is
often used to explain the differences in doses
required for asthma control between HFA-
based and CFC-based BDP therapies.16­18
However, the marked difference in FPF between
the HFA- and CFC-based formulations (36%
and 18% of metered doses, respectively)18 is
rarely mentioned, even though the fine particle
dose provided by a 100 µg dose of HFA-based
BDP is similar to that from a 250 µg dose of the
CFC-based BDP formulation (34.5 µg and 45
µg, respectively).30
The present study adds to the debate around the
most appropriate MMAD for particles to deposit
in the lungs. In this study, TLD was consistent
for particles with an MMAD of 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5
µm, with TLD highest when FPF was high (40%).
Other studies also suggest that particles with an
MMAD in the range 1.5­4.5 µm can achieve
good lung deposition, consistent with these find-
ings. For example, modest differences in TLD
were reported for monodisperse salbutamol aero-
sols with MMADs of 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 µm (TLD:
56%, 51% and 46%, respectively) in a scintigra-
phy study.22 A separate study, which used mono-
disperse FP aerosols to evaluate the effects of
particle size on systemic bioavailability, showed
that although deposition was reduced at the larg-
est particle size studied (MMAD 6.0 µm) com-
pared with smaller particle sizes, systemic
bioavailability was similar for aerosols with
MMADs of 1.5 µm and 3.0 µm.31 A study that
used activated charcoal to block gastrointestinal
drug absorption evaluated the pulmonary bioa-
vailability of monodisperse BDP aerosols and
reported greater lung deposition for aerosols with
MMADs of 3.0 µm and 4.5 µm than for those
with an MMAD of 1.5 µm.32 The reduced lung
deposition with the smallest particles was thought
to be due to a large proportion of small particles
being exhaled owing to the lack of efficient depo-
sition mechanisms.32 This hypothesis was sup-
ported by a scintigraphy study that showed that
22% of particles with an MMAD of 1.5 µm were
exhaled, compared with 8% and 2% of particles
with MMADs of 3.0 µm and 6.0 µm, respec-
tively.22 Taken together, these suggest that there
is little difference in total deposition for particle
sizes in the range of 1.5­4.5 µm for formulations
with a high FPF, but suggest a decrease in deposi-
tion when particle size increases above 5.0
µm.22,31,32
MMAD may instead provide more information
about the relative regional deposition of particles.
Our study showed that MMAD did indeed have
some influence on regional lung deposition. For
smaller particles (MMADs, 1.5 m and 3.0 m),
deposition occurred mainly in the peripheral air-
ways, whereas for larger particles (MMAD, 4.5
Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 12
12 journals.sagepub.com/home/tar
m), deposition was mainly in the central airways.
This is consistent with findings reported by
Usmani and colleagues, who showed that periph-
eral deposition decreased with increasing MMAD
(1.5 µm, 25%; 3.0 µm, 17%; 6.0 µm, 11%),
although central deposition was similar across the
different MMADs (1.5 µm, 32%; 3.0 µm, 34%;
6.0 µm, 35%).22 By contrast, we found that FPF
did not influence regional lung deposition.
Our study thus underlines the important influ-
ence of FPF on TLD and indicates that TLD is
not solely related to the MMAD of a drug; how-
ever, it suggests that MMAD may have an effect
on regional lung deposition.
Inhalation profile and FP/FORM deposition
Our FRI study provided a first insight into the
lung deposition associated with FP/FORM. It
showed that a gradual inhalation profile and flow
rate of 30 L/min were associated with significantly
higher TLD than a sharp inhalation profile at a
flow rate of 60 L/min, although FP/FORM pro-
vides high levels of lung deposition (35.8­44.0%
of metered dose) with both inhalation profiles
and flow rates. Importantly, deposition of FP/
FORM occurred throughout the central and
peripheral airways. FP/FORM has a high FPF of
approximately 40% of the metered dose,19 and, as
discussed above, this may explain the high levels
of drug deposition seen with FP/FORM. Our
results also highlight that a formulation with an
MMAD of >1.5 µm can reach the peripheral air-
ways; FP/FORM, with an MMAD of 3.2­3.5 µm,
showed a greater proportion of lung deposition in
the peripheral airways than in the central airways
in all conditions tested.
With FP/FORM, lung deposition occurred
mostly in the peripheral airways, although some
variation in peripheral distribution was observed
across the different inhalation conditions; cen-
tral deposition showed little variation across
inhalation profiles and flow rates. The reasons
for higher peripheral lung deposition with a
gradual inhalation than with a sharp inhalation
remain to be determined. However, this may be
due to an increased likelihood of particles
impacting the throat and walls of the proximal
airways from the force of a sharp inhalation; this
would be less likely with a gentler, gradual inha-
lation, thereby increasing the likelihood of
peripheral deposition. Given the involvement of
both small and large airways in asthma, a bal-
ance between central and peripheral deposition
may be important, especially for ICS/LABA
combinations that provide both anti-inflamma-
tory and bronchodilatory effects.33
The ability to provide high levels of lung deposi-
tion despite variations in inhalation profile and
flow rates may also be relevant given how pMDIs
are used in real life: patients exhibit a diverse
range of inhalation profiles that vary not only
among patients but also in successive breaths by
the same individual.34 FRI showed that the FP/
FORM pMDI was forgiving at high inspiratory
flow rates, providing consistent deposition even at
the high peak flow rates assessed in the study (94
L/min and 114 L/min for gradual and sharp pro-
files, respectively, for 60 L/min). Furthermore,
the inhaler characteristics of the FP/FORM
pMDI were similar to those used to assess the dif-
ferent inhalation profiles, suggesting that FP/
FORM may provide some deposition even at
excessive flow rates.
Study limitations
In addition to the general modelling limitations
outlined above, it is important to note that the
modelled distribution used in this study (a
monodisperse fraction with a fraction of >10
µm) does not represent the complicated particle-
size distributions of pMDIs seen in real life. This
was intended to be a theoretical study, to pro-
vide some initial insight into the effect of specific
inhalation characteristics (inhalation duration,
flow rate, MMAD and FPF) on lung deposition
for the theoretical formulation used, while keep-
ing all other variables constant; the effect of
other particle distributions on these parameters
is unknown. The influence of factors such as
particle evaporation and deceleration was not
addressed specifically, as this was beyond the
scope of this study. However, the particles went
through evaporation and some deceleration
because the model took the particle distributions
from an Anderson cascade impactor. Further
studies are required to assess fully all of the
parameters that may influence drug-deposition
patterns in real life, including the full, complex
physics of aerosols. However, the findings from
this study may still provide useful information
regarding the effect of some inhalation and
patient characteristics on TLD for real-life
formulations.
C Van Holsbeke, J De Backer et al.

Another limitation is that, in this model, the
inhaler was actuated at the start of inhalation,
reflecting a good inhaler technique. Many
patients, however, have difficulty coordinating
inhalation with actuation, so our findings are
more representative of optimal use of a device
than may be of typical use in clinical practice.
However, it should also be recognized that in vivo
studies with scintigraphy assess drug deposition
only in highly trained patients, so these studies
are also reflective only of optimum technique and
do not necessarily indicate deposition achieved in
everyday use. Further FRI studies could poten-
tially evaluate the effects of differences in the tim-
ing of inhaler actuation on lung deposition.
Conclusion
There is a complex interplay between the factors
that affect lung deposition, and therefore clinical
efficacy, of an inhaled drug. These include inha-
lation profile and formulation characteristics, as
well as anatomical variation among patients and
lung function. Although FRI carries general limi-
tations associated with any mathematical model-
ling, it may still provide important insights into
the relative contributions of, and interplay
between, these different factors. In particular, it
reduces the need to dose patients with radioac-
tively labelled compounds and facilitates testing
that would be difficult, costly and time-consum-
ing in vivo.
The results of our modelling study using FRI
show how inhalation characteristics and aerosol
particle size may affect lung deposition for a spe-
cific particle-size distribution. Our data support
the ERS/ISAM guidelines, which recommend a
long, slow inhalation because this clearly improves
both TLD and peripheral deposition. The study
also demonstrates that, for the specific particle-
size distribution used, FPF can have a major
effect on TLD, with deposition increasing as FPF
increases, whereas MMAD only influenced
regional deposition at the same FPF. Finally, this
is the first study to predict that the FP/FORM
pMDI should provide high levels of drug deposi-
tion throughout the central and peripheral air-
ways, and that variation in inhalation profile and
flow rate would be expected to have little effect on
deposition. Future studies using FRI will further
our understanding of the deposition of inhaled
drugs and therefore help to improve the manage-
ment of asthma.
