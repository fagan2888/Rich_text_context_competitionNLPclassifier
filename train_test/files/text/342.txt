OBJECTIVE -- To examine the association of A1C levels and fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
with diabetic retinopathy in the U.S. population and to compare the ability of the two glycemic
measures to discriminate between people with and without retinopathy.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- This study included 1,066 individuals aged
40 years from the 2005­2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A1C, FPG,
and 45° color digital retinal images were assessed. Retinopathy was defined as a level 14 on the
Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study severity scale. We used joinpoint regression to
identify linear inflections of prevalence of retinopathy in the association between A1C and FPG.
RESULTS -- The overall prevalence of retinopathy was 11%, which is appreciably lower than
the prevalence in people with diagnosed diabetes (36%). There was a sharp increase in retinop-
athy prevalence in those with A1C 5.5% or FPG 5.8 mmol/l. After excluding 144 people
using hypoglycemic medication, the change points for the greatest increase in retinopathy
prevalence were A1C 5.5% and FPG 7.0 mmol/l. The coefficients of variation were 15.6 for A1C
and 28.8 for FPG. Based on the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves, A1C was
a stronger discriminator of retinopathy (0.71 [95% CI 0.66­0.76]) than FPG (0.65 [0.60 ­
0.70], P for difference  0.009).
CONCLUSIONS -- The steepest increase in retinopathy prevalence occurs among individ-
uals with A1C 5.5% and FPG 5.8 mmol/l. A1C discriminates prevalence of retinopathy
better than FPG.

Tests of glycemia and their thresholds
for diabetes diagnosis is an area of
long-standing debate. The presence
of diabetic retinopathy is arguably the
best criterion from which to compare gly-
cemic measures because it is a specific and
early clinical complication usually related
to diabetes, and it represents a specific
and relevant clinical end point for judging
an alternative test (1). For these reasons,
diabetic retinopathy has served as the ba-
sis for diagnostic criteria of type 2 diabe-
tes (2­4) and provides the rationale for
the American Diabetes Association's rec-
ommendation of a threshold of a fasting
plasma glucose (FPG) of 7.0 mmol/l to
define the presence of diabetes (4,5).
However, an analysis of three recent pop-
ulation-based cross-sectional studies sug-
gested that there may be considerable
variation across populations and that the
association of FPG with retinopathy prev-
alence may be more of a continuous rela-
tionship than previously thought (5).
A1C levels are being considered as
an alternative diagnostic tool for diabe-
tes diagnosis (6). Unlike FPG, A1C does
not require an overnight fast, is not af-
fected by short-term lifestyle changes,
and has less variability within individu-
als than FPG (7­9). Nevertheless, few
studies have examined the prevalence
of retinopathy across the spectrum of
A1C levels, which could assist in the
designation of ideal A1C diagnostic cut
points (2,3).
The newly released National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 2005­2006 incorporated a
multiple-field retinal photograph examina-
tion, presenting an opportunity to reassess
the selection of glucose and A1C cut points
for diabetes diagnosis. Our objectives were
to examine the relation between levels of
A1C and FPG and prevalence of retinopa-
thy in the U.S. population and to compare
the ability of both measures to differentiate
people with and without retinopathy.

METHODS -- We analyzed2005­2006
data from NHANES, a cross-sectional na-
tionally representative sample of the U.S.
civilian noninstitutionalized population.
The sample was obtained using a strati-
fied multistage probability design with
planned oversampling of older people
and minority groups. Detailed descrip-

attended the mobile examination center,
1,393 people (46%) were randomized to
a morning session where blood was
drawn for the measurement of FPG and
A1C and retinal fundus photography ex-
aminations were performed. After exclud-
ing people who fasted 8 or 24 h (n 
144), pregnant women (n  2), those
with invalid FPG (n  24) or A1C values
(n  4), and those without completed ret-
inopathy grading (n  153), the final an-
alytic sample consisted of 1,066 adults.
For the latter exclusion, fundus photog-
raphy was not completed for individuals
because of lack of time available to com-
plete the examination (n  64), physical
limitations (n  25), eye-specific limita-
tions (n  16), refusal (n  19), commu-
nication problems (n  5), accompanying
child (n  5), illness (n  4), and equip-
ment failure or unspecified problems
(n  15). The NHANES protocol was ap-
proved by a human subjects review
board, and informed consent was ob-
tained from all participants.
Two 45° nonmydriatic color digital
images of the retina were taken of each eye
by a technologist using a Canon CR6-
45NM ophthalmic digital imaging system
and Canon EOS 10D digital camera. The
first image was centered on the macula,
and the second was centered on the optic
nerve. Retinopathy lesions were graded at
the University of Wisconsin Ocular Epi-
demiology Reading Center according to
the modified Airlie House classification
system, as used in the Early Treatment
Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)
(11). Participants were dichotomized
based on ETDRS severity level as having
retinopathy (14) or not having retinop-
athy (14).
A1C was measured by high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as
used in the Diabetes Control and Compli-
cations Trial (10). FPG was measured in
the morning after an 8- to 24-h fast at a
central laboratory using a hexokinase en-
zymatic method (10).
Participants were asked if a doctor or
health care professional had ever told
them they have diabetes (other than ges-
tational diabetes). Those who responded
"yes" were classified as having diagnosed
diabetes.
Hypertension was defined as use of
antihypertensive medication or the mean
of three or four readings of systolic blood
pressure 140 mmHg and/or diastolic
blood pressure 90 mmHg. Time since
diagnosis of diabetes, diabetes treatment,
age, sex, and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, others) were
self-reported.
Statistical analysis
We compared three approaches to cate-
gorizing A1C and FPG. First, we used de-
ciles, a widely used approach, to group
data. Second, we applied the cut points
used in an analysis of the Pima Indians
(2). Third, since both approaches may not
yield a precise change point, we also used
a moving average smoothing technique.
Taking a 0.1-unit increment each time
from the lowest to the highest levels of A1C
and FPG, we created a series of subsets
with a 0.5-unit range of A1C or FPG (win-
dow) and then calculated the mean A1C
and FPG and the prevalence of retinopa-
thy for each subset. SAS callable SUDAAN
(version 9.0.1; SUDAAN Statistical Soft-
ware Center, Research Triangle Park, NC)
was used to calculate standard errors
based on Taylor Series linearization.
Joinpoint regression, in which the re-
lationship between the dependent and
independent variables is modeled as
piecewise linear phases, is often useful to
describe changes in trend data. It is also
called piecewise regression, segmented
regression, broken line regression, or
multiphase regression with the continu-
ity constraint (12). We used logistic re-
gression, accounting for the complex
sampling design, to obtain predicted
prevalences and standard errors; we then
tested the null hypothesis of no change
points of these prevalences by glucose cat-
egories using joinpoint regression soft-
ware developed by the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results program
of the National Cancer Institute (version
3.3; Rockville, MD). We tested a constant
prevalence of A1C or FPG level below the
joinpoint and a linear association above.
In addition, to summarize and compare
the ability of A1C and FPG to identify ret-
inopathy cases, we used Stata (version
10.1; StataCorp, College Station, TX) and
applied logistic regression, accounting for
the complex survey design, to calculate
the predicted probability of retinopathy
for each participant and the areas under
receiver operating characteristic curves
(AUCs). Larger values of AUC indicate a
better ability to discriminate. Because there
is no postestimation command of AUC cal-
culation specifically for complex sampling
of survey data, the variation of AUC in this
study might be underestimated.
Our primary analyses included peo-
ple with and without diabetes. Because of
the potential for confounding from hypo-
glycemic treatment, we conducted sensi-
tivity analyses in which we excluded
participants receiving hypoglycemic
medications. This exclusion eliminated
34% of those with retinopathy.
RESULTS -- The overall study popu-
lation, weighted to be representative of
the U.S. noninstitutionalized population
aged 40 years, had a mean age of 56
years, 47% were male, 79% were non-
Hispanic white, 9% were non-Hispanic
black, and 12% were of "other" race and
ethnicity. Mean A1C and FPG were 5.7%
and 5.9 mmol/l (106 mg/dl), respectively.
Among the participants with diabetes,
88% were using hypoglycemic medica-
tion and 40% of those taking hypoglyce-
mic medication had FPG 7.0 mmol/l. In
this study population, the prevalence of
any retinopathy was 11% and was appre-

ciably higher in those with (36%) than in
those without diagnosed diabetes (8%).
Table 1 shows that people with reti-
nopathy were older, more likely to be
men, had a higher prevalence of diag-
nosed diabetes and diabetes treatment, and
were more likely to have hypertension. The
coefficients of variation (CVs) (%), calcu-
lated as (100  standard deviation)/mean,
where standard deviation  [(sample
sizestandarderror2)/designeffect)0.5]are
unitless and therefore can be compared be-
tween datasets having different units; the
CVs were 15.6 and 28.8 for A1C and FPG
(P  0.001), respectively.
Figure 1A shows retinopathy preva-
lence by A1C deciles (5.0, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5,
5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 6.0, and 6.7%), cut points of
the Pima Indian study (4.8, 5.0, 5.1, 5.3,
5.5, 5.7, 5.9, 6.6, and 9.4%) (2), and a
0.1% increment with a fixed 0.5% width
window. Regardless of the approach
used, there was a sharp increase in reti-
nopathy prevalence above an A1C of
5.5% (95% CI 5.3­5.6 for the decile ap-
proach, 5.1­6.1 for the Pima Indian ap-
proach, and 5.3­5.8 by the moving
average approach) (all P values 0.05).
The linear regression coefficients of reti-
nopathy prevalence by the 1% increment
approach were 0.7 (P  0.756) and 12.7
(P  0.001) for before and after the
change point of 5.5%, respectively. That
is, above an A1C of 5.5%, the prevalence
of retinopathy rose 12.7% for each 1%
A1C increment.
Figure 1B describes retinopathy prev-
alence by FPG deciles (4.8, 5.0, 5.2, 5.4,
5.5, 5.7, 6.0, 6.4, and 7.7 mmol/l), cut
points of the Pima Indian study (4.9, 5.2,
5.3, 5.5, 5.8, 6.0, 6.4, 7.5, and 12.4
mmol/l) (2), and a 0.1-mmol/l increment
with a fixed 0.5-mmol/l­width window.
Regardless of the approach to categorize
FPG, there was a sharp increase in reti-
nopathy prevalence after 5.8 mmol/l
(95% CI 5.1­6.1 for the decile approach,
5.2­6.8 for the Pima Indian approach,
and 5.3­6.3 by the moving average ap-
proach) (all P values 0.05). The linear
regression coefficients of retinopathy
prevalence by the FPG 1% increment ap-
proach were 0.8 (P  0.476) and 3.9 (P 
0.001) for before and after the change
point of 5.8 mmol/l, respectively.
After excluding participants taking
hypoglycemic medications, by using the
moving average approach, the change
point for A1C (%) remained at 5.5 (95%
CI 5.2­5.7); the regression coefficients
were 0.8 (P  0.409) and 10.5 (P 
0.001) for before and after the change
point of 5.5, respectively. However, for
FPG, the change point increased from 5.8
to 7.0 mmol/l (6.8­7.2). The regression
coefficients for retinopathy prevalence
were 1.1 (P  0.079) and 4.3 (P  0.001)
for before and after the change point,
respectively.
Based on the total study population,
AUC indicated that A1C was more accu-
rate than FPG in discriminating retinopa-
thy cases from noncases: AUC 0.71 (95%
CI 0.66­0.76) for A1C and 0.65 (0.60­
0.70) for FPG, P for difference  0.009
(Fig. 2). At A1C cut points of 5.5, 6.0, and
6.5%, the sensitivities and specificities
were 80 and 37%, 55 and 79%, and 38
and 92%, respectively. At an FPG cut
point of 5.8, 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5 mmol/l,
sensitivities and specificities were 58 and
64%, 43 and 84%, 35 and 89%, and 30
and 92%, respectively.
We reran the models using multivar-
iate logistic regression on the total study
population that included selected covari-
ates of glycemia and retinopathy risk (age,
sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, waist circumfer-
ence, time since diagnoses of diabetes,
diabetes treatment, and hypertension
status). The AUC of A1C and prevalence
of retinopathy increased from 0.71 to
0.75 (P  0.060), and the AUC of FPG
and prevalence of retinopathy increased

from 0.65 to 0.74 (P  0.001). For both
A1C and FPG, only time since diagnosis
of diabetes and sex were significantly
related to prevalence of retinopathy,
and their inclusion improved the dis-
crimination of prevalence of retinopa-
thy in these two full models (both P
values 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS -- Using nationally
representative data, we examined the
associations of A1C and FPG with reti-
nopathy prevalence in the U.S. noninsti-
tutionalized population aged 40 years.
For both measures of glycemia, we iden-
tified points at which retinopathy preva-
lence began to rise sharply. Retinopathy
prevalence began to rise precipitously
when A1C exceeded 5.5% (correspond-
ing to the 5th decile) and after FPG ex-
ceeded 5.8 mmol/l (corresponding to the
7th decile). This study also demonstrates
that the change points are helpful in find-
ing the lowest cut point for the diagnosis
of retinopathy. However, to be used clin-
ically, at a minimum, further analyses to
determine cut points for the diagnosis of
retinopathy would need to include sensi-
tivity and specificity analyses.
Our A1C change point is similar to
that observed in a recent Japanese study
(5.3­5.5%) (13) but lower than that ob-
served in some previous studies, includ-
ing the Pima Indian study (6.2%), the
Egyptian study (6.3%), and NHANES III
(6.0%) (14). There are at least three rea-
sons for this finding. First, in our study,
retinopathy was assessed by two retinal
photographs in each eye, while previous
studies used either one retinal photo-
graph in one eye or direct ophthalmos-
copy to detect retinopathy. Thus, our use
of a more sensitive assessment of retinop-
athy (5) may have identified the presence
of retinopathy at lower A1C levels. Sec-
ond, a higher proportion of the Egyptian
and the Pima Indian populations were at
high risk for or had diabetes (2,3); thus,
compared with the U.S. population, the
whole A1C distribution may be shifted to
the left. Third, discrepancies in cutoff
points may be due to differences in labo-
ratory methods for A1C measurement
(15).
In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Athero-
sclerosis (MESA) population, there was a
continuous relation between prevalent
retinopathy (defined as ETDRS level
20) and A1C and, based on change
point analysis, no clear evidence of a
threshold (5). Moreover, retinopathy in
the absence of diabetes (FPG 7 mmol/l)
was more frequent among individuals of
minority racial groups than whites (16),
suggesting a higher likelihood of retinop-
athy not due to hyperglycemia among mi-
nority populations. This may have
influenced the capacity of identifying a
clear A1C threshold. In our study, minor-
ities represented 30% of the population,
but in MESA they represented 60% of the
population.
In the overall population, retinopathy
prevalence increased precipitously after
FPG levels of 5.8 mmol/l, but the change
point was higher (7.0 mmol/l) among
those not receiving hypoglycemic treat-
ment. This suggests that treatment affects
FPG level and shifts the FPG distribution
among people with diabetes to the left.
The FPG change points observed in our
study span the range of levels observed in
previous studies, including the Pima In-
dian (6.8 mmol/l) and the Egyptian stud-
ies (6.4 mmol/l) (2,14). However, in
contrast with our findings, a recent anal-
ysis of three population-based studies
(Blue Mountains Eye Study, Australian
Diabetes Obesity and Lifestyle Study, and
MESA) did not detect a clear FPG thresh-
old for the prevalence of any or moderate
retinopathy (5). Demographic differences
(age, sex, and race/ethnicity), differences
in status of hypoglycemic treatment, and
criteriaofdiagnosisofretinopathycouldex-
plain these discrepancies.
There are several advantages to A1C
as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. A1C
is less affected by short-term lifestyle
changes, and its measurement has been
improved and standardized during the
last decade. While hemoglobinopathies
and race/ethnicity may reduce the validity
of A1C as a diagnostic tool (17,18), A1C
level has less variability than FPG (7­9).
Nevertheless, the interindividual variabil-
ity of A1C is far more complicated than
that of FPG. Genetic factors account for a
significant part of the variation in A1C
among people without diabetes (19). Gly-
cation rate is also influenced by factors
other than the level of plasma glucose
(20). In our study, A1C had a smaller CV
and a larger AUC than FPG. Though FPG
had a similar level of AUC after adjusting
for other variables, these adjustments are
not practical in clinical practice. These re-
sults suggested that in some circum-
stances A1C may discriminate prevalent
retinopathy better than FPG.
Our findings provide additional sup-
port for the current diagnostic threshold
of FPG in diabetes while providing guid-
ance for potential diagnostic thresholds
based on A1C. However, we caution
against the overreliance of these data
for several reasons. First, even though
retinopathy is more specific than other
diabetes complications, the Diabetes
Prevention Program recruited a popula-

retinopathy.

tion at high risk for developing diabetes
and found that 8% of people with FPG
below diabetic levels had retinopathy
(21). Similar findings have been reported
by others (5). In our study, 8% of partic-
ipants with FPG 7.0 mmol/l had reti-
nopathy. Longitudinal studies have
reported that the presence of retinopathy
in people with normal glucose levels at
baseline predicts the development of dia-
betes (22,23), suggesting that some fac-
tors may play a role in the pathogenesis of
both microvascular changes and diabetes.
The presence of retinopathy among non-
diabetic individuals may also be related to
other conditions such as hypertension. In
our subset analysis among people without
diabetes, the prevalence of retinopathy
was 10% in those with hypertension and
6% in those without hypertension (P 
0.222). The presence of these retinal le-
sions in nondiabetic people is likely to
attenuate the detection of the change
point of glucose level for retinopathy. Ex-
amining the prevalence of more advanced
retinopathy by A1C levels may help in
the identification of diagnostic cut
points. However, because only 2 years of
NHANES data are available, there is insuf-
ficient power to explore this issue further.
Second, our main analyses included
people with previous hypoglycemic treat-
ment. The inclusion of people on such
treatment could artificially reduce levels
of glycemia in the population and lead to
an overestimation of the steepness in the
prevalence of retinopathy by glycemic
level. Theoretically, a preferable study de-
sign would follow people without diabe-
tes treatment prospectively until the
development of retinopathy; however,
such a design is impractical due to the
ethical problem of following high-risk
people without starting hypoglycemic
treatment. In a sensitivity analysis, we ex-
cluded participants taking diabetes-
related medications. This had no effect on
the A1C change point but raised the
change point for FPG.
Third, variability among different as-
say methods of A1C is a potential source
of inaccuracy whenever A1C results are
interpreted relative to universal, fixed,
clinical decision thresholds (15). The
mean and range of percent A1C and per-
cent of total glycated hemoglobin mea-
sured by the ion-exchange method
(which this study used) and the affinity
method are similar. Nevertheless, Nuttall
(24,25) argued that affinity chromatogra-
phy has significant advantages over the
ion-exchange HPLC, especially among
people with diabetes, including less inter-
ference by hemoglobinopathies, more re-
liability, and no need for validation by the
complicated mass spectrometry method.
In summary, based on the latest na-
tionally representative sample, our analy-
sis examined the association of A1C with
retinopathy and provides new informa-
tion on defining cut points for diagnosing
diabetes. While the A1C and FPG levels of
5.5% and 5.8 mmol/l provide start points
at which retinopathy prevalence increases
most precipitously, A1C appears to dis-
criminate between the presence and ab-
sence of retinopathy at least as well as FPG
and offers some advantages over FPG.
