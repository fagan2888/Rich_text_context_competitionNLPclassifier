Abstract This study examines the cardiovascular disease
(CVD) risk profiles of first generation (FG) and second
generation (SG) Mexican-Americans (MA) in two large
national studies­­the Hispanic Health and Nutrition
Examination Study (HHANES) (1982­1984) and the
National Health and Examination Study (NHANES)
(1999­2004). The main outcome measures were five indi-
vidual risk indicators of CVD (total cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking) and a
composite measure (the Framingham Risk Score [FRS]).
The analyses included cross-survey (pseudocohort) and
within-survey (cross-sectional) comparisons. In multivari-
ate analyses, SG men had higher rates of hypertension and
lower rates of smoking than FG men; and SG women had
lower total cholesterol levels, higher rates of hypertension,
and lower rates of smoking than FG women. There was no
generational difference in the FRS in men or women. The
cross-survey comparisons detected generational differences
in CVD risk factors not detected in within-survey com-
parisons, particularly among MA women. Future studies of
generational differences in risk should consider using
pseudocohort comparisons when possible.

Introduction
Previous research suggests that acculturation of immigrant
populations to the United States is associated with wors-
ening cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profiles and with
increasing CVD morbidity and mortality [1, 2]. Specifi-
cally, acculturation has been linked to increased body mass
index [3­5], waist circumference and abdominal obesity [6,
7], hypertension [7­9], type II diabetes mellitus [10, 11],
and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [1, 12, 13].
Recent research has also shown that acculturation is asso-
ciated with increasing subclinical indicators of CVD
including higher levels of coronary calcification, carotid
atherosclerotic plaque, and greater intima-media thickness
[14, 15].
Research focusing on Mexican-Americans has also
shown that acculturation is associated with worsening CVD
risk profiles and higher CVD morbidity and mortality [16,
17]. In particular, US-born Mexican-Americans have been
found to have higher levels of smoking, body mass index
and obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol than
Mexican-American immigrants [6, 18]. US-born Mexican-
Americans have also been shown to have higher levels of
carotid atherosclerotic plaque, and greater intima-media
thickness than Mexican-American immigrants [14]. In
addition, research has shown that US-born Mexican
Americans consume less ``heart healthy diets'' than
Mexican immigrants [19].
One common limitation of the previous research on
generational differences in CVD risk factor profiles among
Mexican-Americans has been its reliance on cross-sec-
tional data. Cross-sectional comparisons between immi-
grants and their US-born counterparts at a particular point
in time do not provide estimates of the ``true'' generational
effects on health because they fail to account for temporal

trends in the health of immigrants. To estimate the ``true''
generational effect on health one must compare the health
of parents and their children, but analyses of cross-
sectional surveys compare immigrants with members of the
second generation in one time period. Within a cross-
sectional survey, members of the second generation are not
the children of the immigrants; rather, they are the children
of immigrants from the previous generation. If the health of
immigrants has improved over time, as is likely with
Mexican-American immigrants given the increases in life
expectancy in Mexico over the past several decades [20],
then cross-sectional studies compare today's healthier
immigrants with the children of less healthy immigrants
from a generation ago. Such comparisons may overstate
true generational declines in health or even indicate a
decline when in fact there is no change or generational
progress. In research on educational outcomes, Smith [21]
found that cross-sectional comparisons of immigrant and
second generation Hispanics substantially understated the
degree of generational progress in educational attainment
and wages.
In this study, we investigate differences in CVD
risk factor profiles between first and second generation
Mexican-Americans with cross-sectional data from two
time periods: 1982­1984 and 1999­2004. To approximate
``true'' comparisons between immigrants (first generation)
and their children with these data, we compare immigrants
in the first time period with second generation individuals
in the second time period. In the social sciences, using
multiple cross-sectional datasets to approximate the anal-
ysis of longitudinal data is commonly referred to as the
construction of pseudo-cohorts [22]. In addition, we take
the typical approach of investigating generational differ-
ences in CVD risk factor profiles between first and second
generation Mexican-Americans within each cross-sectional
survey.
Methods
Data Sources
This study used two data sources: (1) the Hispanic Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES), conducted
between 1982 and 198 [4, 23] and (2) the 1999­2004
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(1999­2004 NHANES) [24]. Both data sources are general
multipurpose health surveys, and public use datasets are
accessible over the Internet (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
nhanes.htm). Both surveys used complex multistage
clustered sampling designs. The HHANES sample was
representative of civilian non-institutionalized Mexican-
Americans living in California, Arizona, New Mexico,
Texas, and Colorado; Puerto Ricans living in the Northeast;
and Cuban-Americans living in Florida at the time of the
survey. The five Southwestern states included in the
HHANES accounted for 83% of the Mexican-American
population of the U.S. in the 1980 census [25]. The
1999­2004 NHANES sample is representative of the entire
U.S. civilian non-institutionalized population, and includes
oversamples of Hispanics, African-Americans, and the
elderly.
Subjects in both surveys were interviewed in the
household and subsequently underwent a standardized
physical examination and laboratory analyses of blood and
urine samples in a mobile examination center (MEC). The
interviews elicited information on a wide range of health
conditions, health behaviors, and demographic and socio-
economic characteristics of participants. The physical
examination included measurements of height and weight
as well as up to three blood pressure measurements. The
laboratory tests included glucose and lipid levels. A subset
of Subjects was asked to fast overnight prior to their
examination and laboratory tests.
Outcome Measures
We assessed the following individual cardiovascular risk
factors: hypertension (yes/no), diabetes (yes/no), total and
high-density lipoprotein (HLD) cholesterol (mg/dl), current
smoking status (yes/no), and body mass index (BMI) kg/m
[2] and obesity (yes/no) [26]. Subjects were categorized as
having hypertension if they had a history of hypertension
diagnosed by a doctor and were taking blood pressure
medications, a systolic blood pressure greater than
140 mmHg, or a diastolic blood pressure greater than
90 mmHg. We used the mean of subjects' first two blood
pressure measurements in determining whether they had
hypertension. We used two blood pressure measurements
rather than three because HHANES only has two mea-
surements. Subjects were categorized as having diabetes if
they had a history of diabetes diagnosed by a doctor and
were taking medications for diabetes or had a fasting blood
glucose level of 126 mg/dl or more.
In addition, we computed the Framingham Risk Score
(FRS) for subjects 30­74 years of age according to the
algorithms published by Wilson et al. [27]. Briefly, the FRS
is a composite score that can be used to estimate the risk of
developing coronary heart disease (CHD) (angina pectoris,
myocardial infarction, or coronary heart disease death)
over a 10-year period for adult men and women 30­
74 years of age. Points are assigned based on a person's
age, gender, total cholesterol (mg/dl), HDL cholesterol
(mg/dl), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg),
presence of diabetes (yes/no), and current smoking status
(yes/no), then the points are summed to obtain the FRS. We

123
assessed each subject's probability of developing CHD
over a 10-year period using published tables [27].
Participants
We identified first and second generation Mexican-Amer-
icans between the ages of 20 and 74 years in the HHANES
and the 1999­2004 NHANES, and excluded pregnant
women. Mexican origin was based on self-report. Indi-
viduals were categorized as first generation if they were
born in Mexico and second generation if they were born in
the US and had at least one parent born in Mexico. In the
HHANES, 2,423 first and second generation Mexican-
Americans completed the interviews, 2,058 completed the
interviews and the physical examination and provided
blood samples, and 661 provided fasting blood samples. In
the 1999­2004 NHANES, 2,296 first and second genera-
tion Mexican-Americans completed the interviews, 2,198
were examined and provided blood samples, and 951
provided fasting blood samples.
The analytic samples differed across the study outcomes
depending on how the data were collected for each out-
come. For example, the information on current smoking
status was obtained from the interviews, the data on blood
pressure measurements were obtained during the physical
examination, and fasting blood glucose levels were
obtained from the fasting blood samples.
Statistical Analysis
We conducted two types of statistical analyses, and strat-
ified all analyses by gender First, we calculated the age-
adjusted mean or prevalence for each individual risk factor
as well as for the FRS in each of the four subgroups of
subjects: Mexican immigrants in HHANES, second gen-
eration Mexican-Americans in HHANES, Mexican immi-
grants in the 1999­2004 NHANES, and second generation
Mexican Americans in the 1999­2004 NHANES. The
reference population for the age-adjustment was the U.S.
population in the 2000 census. We then conducted three
statistical comparisons for each outcome: (1) immigrants
versus second generation within HHANES, (2) immigrants
versus second generation within the 1999­2004 NHANES,
and (3) immigrants in HHANES versus second generation
in the 1999­2004 NHANES. The first two comparisons
take the usual cross-sectional (within-survey) approach to
assessing differences between first and second generation
Mexican-Americans. The third comparison takes a cross-
survey approach and is intended to capture the true gen-
erational change in cardiovascular risk factors, as described
earlier.
Second, we estimated multivariate regression models
with the study outcomes as dependent variables. The main
independent variables of interest were indicator variables
for the four subgroups of subjects defined by generation
(first versus second) and survey (HHNES versus
1999­2004 NHANES). The covariates in the models
included indicators for age (20­34, 35­44, 45­54, 55­64,
65­74), education (no high school diploma, high school
diploma, or more than high school diploma, household
income relative to the federal poverty level (FPL)
(\1.0 FPL, 1.0­2.0 FPL, 2.0­4.0 FPL), and marital status
(married or living together, widowed, divorced or sepa-
rated, or never married).
Several covariates had missing values including marital
status (2% missing), education (8% missing), and income
(7% missing). We used modal substitution to impute
missing values for marital status. Because the percent
missing was somewhat higher for education and income,
we used a three-step procedure to impute missing values
for these variables. Each variable was imputed separately.
First, we estimated an ordinal logistic regression model for
each variable with sex, gender, age, martial status, and
generation as independent variables. Second, for each
individual with missing data we generated probability cut-
points for each category of the variable using the regression
coefficients from the model. Third, we drew a random
number between zero and one from a uniform distribution
and compared it to the probability cut-points in order to
assign each individual to one category.
To account for the complex study designs used in
HHNAES and NHANES 1999­2004, all analyses were
conducted in SUDAAN 8.0 using the recommended
weights for each sample by NCHS [24]. This research was
exempted from human subjects review by the UCLA
Institutional Review Board.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Table 1 shows selected sociodemographic characteristics
of first and second generation Mexican-Americans in the
HHANES and the NHANES 1999­2004 examination
samples. In both the HHANES and NHANES 1999­2004
approximately half of the subjects were female. In both
surveys, first generation Mexican-Americans were young-
er, had lower levels of education, and had lower levels of
income than the second generation. In both surveys,
approximately three-quarters of first and second generation
Mexican-Americans were married.

Age-adjusted Results
Table 2 shows the age-adjusted cross-survey and within-
survey comparisons between first and second generation
Mexican-American men and women. Among men, there
were no differences between first and second generation
men in FRS, total cholesterol or diabetes rates by either
the cross-survey or cross-sectional methods of analysis. In
both the cross-survey and HHANES within-survey com-
parisons, second generation men were less likely to
smoke than first generation men. In the cross-survey
comparison, second generation men had lower HDL
cholesterol than first generation men. In the HHANES
within-survey comparison, second generation men had
higher rates of hypertension than first generation men
(HHANES).
Among women, there were no differences in FRS or
diabetes rates between the first and second generations by
either the cross-survey or within-survey comparisons. By
both methods of comparison, second generation women
had higher HDL cholesterol than first generation women.
In the cross-survey comparison only, second generation
women had lower total cholesterol, higher rates of hyper-
tension, and lower rates of smoking compared to the first
generation counterparts.
Multivariate Results
Table 3 shows the cross-survey and within-survey multi-
variate regression comparisons in cardiovascular risk
between first and second generation men and women
controlling for age, marital status, education, and income.
Results from the multivariate comparisons were largely
consistent with the age-adjusted results, with the following
caveats. Among men, multivariate adjustment rendered the
cross-survey comparison in the HDL cholesterol non-sig-
nificant; the cross-survey and within-survey (NHANES
1999­2004) HTN comparisons significant where they
had been non-significant in the age-adjusted results; and
the within-survey (NHANES 1999­2004) comparison
of smoking non-significant. Among women, multivariate
adjustment rendered both cross-survey comparisons and
the within-survey comparisons in HDL cholesterol non-
significant.

Within-Survey Versus Cross-survey Analyses
There were some noteworthy differences between the results
obtained by the cross-survey and within-survey methods of
analysis, particularly in women. Application of the within-
survey approach only identified a difference in HDL cho-
lesterol between first and second generation women. In
contrast, application of the cross-survey approach identified
differences in total cholesterol, hypertension, and smoking
between first and second generation women. These findings
suggest that it is important to consider temporal trends in
the health of immigrants when evaluating generational
differences.
Discussion
Whether first and second generation Mexican-Americans
were compared using the cross-survey approach (HHANES
first generation versus NHANES 1999­2004 second gen-
eration) or the within-survey approach (HHANES first
versus second generation and NHANES 1999­2004 first
versus second generation), significant generational differ-
ences in individual cardiovascular disease risk factors
levels were found. Specifically, second generation men had
a higher rate of hypertension than first generation men in
the cross-survey comparison and in both within-survey
comparisons; second generation women had a higher
hypertension rate than first generation women, but only in
the cross-survey comparison; second generation men and
women had lower smoking rates in the cross-survey com-
parisons and in men, in the within-survey comparison using
HHANES only; second generation men had a lower mean
HDL cholesterol level in the cross-survey comparison
whereas second generation women had a higher mean HDL
level in the cross-survey comparison and both within-sur-
vey comparisons; and lastly, second generation women had
a lower mean total cholesterol level in the cross-survey
comparison.
As discussed in the Introduction, most previous studies of
generational differences in cardiovascular disease risk fac-
tors in Hispanics relied on cross-sectional (within-survey)
comparisons. However, generational differences found in
cross-sectional data may be confounded by secular trends in
the health of immigrants. The optimal way to investigate
generational differences in risk factor levels would be to use
multigenerational longitudinal data that includes immigrants
and their children. Unfortunately, these kinds of longitudinal
studies of Mexican immigrants and their children are not
currently available. In this study, we have addressed this
issue by comparing first generation adults in an older data set
(HHANES) with second generation adults in a newer data set
(NHANES), approximating comparisons between immi-
grant parents and their US-born children (i.e., cross-survey

approach). In the social sciences, the technique of approxi-
mating longitudinal data by using multiple waves of cross-
sectional data is referred to as the pseudo-cohort approach
[22]. Our results suggest that indeed there are important
differences between the results obtained from cross-survey
(cross-survey) and cross-sectional (within-survey) compar-
isons; in the case of this study, particularly among women.
Specifically, first and second generation women differed
with respect to total cholesterol, hypertension and smoking
in the cross-survey comparisons but not cross-sectional
comparisons. Researchers using cross-sectional data to
investigate generational differences in health should be
aware of the potential for confounding due to secular trends
in the health of immigrants and seek to check their results
using pseudo-cohorts when feasible.
Despite there being differences in individual risk factor
levels, first and second generation Mexican-Americans had
similar overall risks of developing coronary heart disease
over a ten-year time horizon. Specifically, first and second
generation men and women had statistically similar
10-year risk of coronary heart disease as estimated by the
FRS, whether immigrant men and women were compared
with their second generation counterparts using cross-sur-
vey or within-survey comparisons. These results suggest
that the risk factor distributions favoring one generation
may have been balanced by those favoring the other,
resulting in no net difference in near-term cardiovascular
risk. For example, compared to first generation women,
second generation women had higher hypertension rates
but also lower smoking rate rates. Another possible
explanation for the lack of any significant generational
differences in the FRS may have been the small numbers of
older first and second generation Mexican-Americans in
HHANES. In HHANES, there were only 61 men and 75
women that were 65 years of age and older. Had there been
greater numbers of older Mexican-American men and
women in these studies, significant generational differences
in risk might have been detectable.
In contrast to this study, previous studies have found
that less acculturated Hispanics have more favorable car-
diovascular disease risk factor profiles than more accul-
turated Hispanics. For example, compared with US-born
Hispanics, foreign-born Hispanics have been found to have
more favorable levels of blood pressure, cholesterol, dia-
betes, body mass index, abdominal circumference, smok-
ing, and coronary calcifications [6, 12, 15, 28]. There are,
however, important methodological differences between
this and previous studies. First, previous studies have fre-
quently compared foreign-born Hispanics to US-born
Hispanics, not distinguishing among the multiple generations
of US-born Hispanics. If acculturation continues across
multiple generations as suggested by Portes and Rumbaut
[29], then important differences between second, third,
fourth, and higher generations of Mexican-Americans

may be unaccounted for in earlier studies. In contrast, this
study was limited to comparisons between first and second
generation individuals. Second, many previous studies pool
Hispanics together regardless of ethnic or national
background. There is, however, mounting evidence that
Hispanic subgroups differ with respect to risk factors,
mortality and many other important measures of health
status [30]. To avoid the possible confounding of genera-
tional differences by compositional differences in national
origin, this study is limited to Mexican-Americans. Finally,
generational status is not a measure for acculturation,
though the two measures are correlated. Generational status
is solely determined by the birthplaces of an individual and
of her parents. By contrast, acculturation is a multi-
dimensional construct that is defined by factors such as
engaging in culturally-specific behaviors (e.g., food, music
and media); language proficiency; knowledge of culture-
specific history and current events; the cultural makeup of
one's social network; and one's own ethnic and cultural
identity [31]. Thus studies that have used measures of
acculturation may not find the same results as this study
that used generation.
Access to care could have confounded the results of this
study, particularly with respect to cholesterol levels. Con-
ceptually, access to care might influence cholesterol levels
by leading to the receipt of cholesterol lowering drugs.
Thus individuals with better access to care might have
lower cholesterol levels independent of their generational
status. Unfortunately, HHANES does not include variables
that allow us to evaluate the prevalence of dyslipidemias
(as opposed to cholesterol level). To better understand the
relationship between cholesterol levels and access to care,
we regressed cholesterol on generational status, age, and
usual source of care (yes/no). Among women, controlling
for usual source of care made no difference in the results.
Among men, however, controlling for usual source of care
resulted in the contrast between first and second generation
within HHANES becoming insignificant. Interestingly,
men with a usual source of care had higher cholesterol
levels (beta = 6.02; P = 0.05) than men without a usual
source of care, suggesting that need for care (as measured
by cholesterol) was associated with access to care (as
measured by usual source of care). The impact of the risk
factors in this study on future cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality will depend upon access to health care and to
appropriate risk reducing therapies.
Mexican-Americans are the largest and fastest growing
subgroup of Hispanics in the US, yet despite their demo-
graphic importance Mexican-American immigrants and
their children remain vastly understudied groups. Because of
their increasing numbers, Mexican-American immigrants
and their children are destined to have significant impacts on
the US health care system. Therefore gaining a better
understanding of generational changes in health and factors
that influence generational changes in health among Mexi-
can-Americans is essential. This research study takes a small
step towards developing a better understanding of the role of
generational change and health. However, much more pop-
ulation-based research targeting Mexican-American immi-
grants is needed before effective interventions to maintain
and improve health in these groups can be developed.
