Literature Review
A high incarceration rate of African American males has
resulted in a high unemployment for African American ex-
offenders. Harrison and Karberg (2004) of the U.S. Bureau
of Justice Statistics examined the United States prisons and
jails population at midyear 2003. The United States ended
the decade of the 1990s with more people behind bars than
any other decade in the nation's history. From 1970 to 2001,
the increase in the number of people in our jails and prisons
unparalleled any other in our nation's history. Harrison and
Karberg (2004) reported that in 1970 our jails and prisons
held 338,029 persons and by midyear 2004 that number was
2,131,180 inmates in state or federal prisons and local jails.
It was also reported that African Americans comprised 47%
of the United States jail and prison populations, yet only 13%
of the nation's population.
Carson and Sabol (2012) of the Bureau of Justice Statistics
submitted an analysis of the corrections population in a
report called "Prisoners in 2011." Their analysis revealed
that the state and federal prison populations had declined
from 1,613,803 to 1,598,780 inmates. This was the second
year in a row that the prison population had declined.
According to Carson and Sabol, their analysis also revealed
that during the same period African American and Hispanic
males and females were incarcerated at a higher rate than
Whites in all age groups.
The problem was discussed in a special report from the
Bureau of Justice Statistics titled "Prevalence of
Imprisonment in the United States Population, 1974­2001"
(Bonczar, 2003). Bonczar reported that at the end of 2001,
more than 5.6 millionAmericans had served time in prison or
were currently in prison. The report provided updated esti-
mates of the lifetime chances of going to prison using stan-
dard demographic life table techniques that projected the
likelihood of incarceration for someone born in 2001. The
prevalence report revealed that if the rates of first incarcera-
tion remained the same, 6.6% of all persons born in the
United States in 2001 will go to State or Federal prison dur-
ing their lifetime. More specifically, Bonczar claimed that
based on his calculation of the prevalence of imprisonment
in the United States, roughly 1 in 3 Black males born in the
United States in 2001 are expected to go to prison in their
lifetime compared to 1 in 17 White males.
Cox (2010) examined crime, incarceration, and employ-
ment in the context of economic choice theory. Cox reported
that the current rate of incarceration will result in 11% of all
males being incarcerated in their lifetime. Cox further
reported that the lifetime rate for African Americans is a dra-
matic 18.6%.
Alexander (2012) reported the incarceration of African
Americans as the new era of Jim Crow. Alexander explained
how the disparity in incarceration has led to a new racial
caste system. Alexander argues that the racial control of

Milwaukee's Disregarded Population: Out
of Sight; Out of Mind

Abstract
The research was a partial replication of Devah Pager's study of the effect of a criminal record on employment opportunities
in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin labor market. A quantitative and qualitative method was utilized to examine the effects of a
criminal record, race, and the relationship between employers' willingness to hire ex-offenders and their actual hiring of ex-
offenders. An experimental audit was conducted by two testers (one Black male and one White male) to audit 30 employers.
The results supported Pager's findings. There was a dramatic negative effect for the Black male tester. Three themes emerged
from the testers' diaries and debriefings: (a) the application process was influenced in the favor of the White male by a
"gatekeeper," (b) racism was evident, and (c) an emotional effect was noted on both testers. Finally, during a telephone
survey of the same employers, they indicated a willingness to hire both ex-offenders regardless of their race, yet the audit
revealed the opposite.

African Americans is conducted through the criminal justice
system. According to Alexander, the "War on Drugs" has led
to close to one-half of young African American men being
incarcerated in our jails and prisons or labeled felons for life.
Also, the felony disenfranchisement laws deny them the
right to vote and serve on juries, and legally discriminated
against in employment, education, and housing.
The literature has examined the effects of a criminal his-
tory on employment and future earnings (Allgood, Mustard,
& Warren, 2003; Cox, 2010; Holzer, Raphael & Stoll, 2003;
Pager, 2003; Pager & Quillian, 2005; Raphael, 2004; Stevans,
2009; Western & Beckett, 1999). For instance, Holzer,
Raphael, and Stoll (2003) argued that arrests and imprison-
ments are associated with lower employment and earnings,
suggesting that lower employment and earnings for ex-
offenders were about 10% to 30% lower than for comparable
individuals with no criminal record. In his study of employ-
ers' demand for ex-offenders in Los Angeles, it was reported
that 80% of employers' surveyed indicated they would not
hire or accept an application from an ex-offender. Employers'
willingness to hire ex-offenders is limited, therefore attribut-
ing to the higher rate of recidivism among individuals with a
criminal history. The proposed research will further examine
the effect of a criminal record on employment opportunities
with regard to differences between Black and White male
subjects.
Background of the Study
Devah Pager's (2003) and Pager and Quillian's (2005) research
used field experiments to study discrimination against minori-
ties and ex-offenders in the low-wage labor market. Holzer
(2003) examined an employer's reported willingness to hire
an ex-offender and their actual hiring of ex-offenders. The
subjects in Holzer's research were 619 employers in Los
Angeles. A 20-minute telephone survey was used to collect
the data. The main variable in the research included indicators
that reflect an employers' reported willingness to hire ex-
offenders and their actual hiring practices. More than 40% of
the employers suggested they would "probably not" or "defi-
nitely not" be willing to hire someone with a criminal record.
Thirty-five percent of the respondents indicated that their
response would depend on the crime.
A major policy concern of Holzer's (2003) research was
employers' reluctance to hire ex-offenders. Research has
shown the notable praise we hear about the progress made in
racial equality is not consistent with actual experiences of
testers (Pager, 2003; Pager & Quillian, 2005). Pager (2003)
and Pager & Quillian (2005) identified similar findings as
they studied the effects of a criminal record on job searches
by ex-convicts in Milwaukee and New York City. Pager used
an experimental audit design and a survey to compare
employers' reported willingness to hire ex-offenders and
their actual hiring practices. The studies conducted in
Milwaukee and the New York City job markets used matched
pairs of testers to apply for entry-level positions. Moreover,
the effect of race in the findings was significant. Only 14%
of Blacks with a criminal record received call backs com-
pared with 34% of White non-criminals (p < .01). Also,
Whites with criminal records received more favorable treat-
ment than Blacks without criminal records (14%).
Pager (2003) and Pager and Quillian (2005) examined if
the employers'willingness to hire matched their actual hiring
practices. Employers were surveyed after the testers had
applied for entry-level positions.
During this second phase of Pagers' study, the same
employers were given an opportunity to respond to a tele-
phone survey on their hiring process (Pager, 2003; Pager &
Quillian, 2005). Pager (2003) reported that in 50% of the
cases, employers were unwilling to consider equally quali-
fied applicants on the basis of their criminal record.
Pager and Quillian (2005) found employers that were
administered the survey indicated a greater willingness to
hire ex-offenders than was evident during the audit.
Responses obtained in the survey reports did not accurately
reflect the actual behavior of an employer (Pager, 2003;
Pager & Quillian 2005).
Statement of the Problem
The door is locked against a prisoner and he goes to live in a
hidden world. If you were to enter that world you should be
startled by what you see. In the United States today we have
2.1 million people behind bars. . . . Forty percent of the prisoners
nationwide are African Americans. . . . Out of sight out of mind
is not acceptable for any part of our justice system. (Supreme
Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, 2003, pp. 1-4)
Mauer (1995) examined the status of African Americans
males within the criminal justice system. He reported that
one in three Black men between the ages of 20 and 29 were
under some form of criminal justice control in 1995.
Mauer (2013) reported that the rate of incarceration of
African American males declined by 9.8%. A decade of mass
incarceration of African Americans has declined from the
overall rate of incarceration. According to Mauer, the ratio of
Black/Hispanic to White is 6.4:1. It can be concluded that the
decline in the United States prison population had a marginal
effect on the rate of African Americans incarcerated com-
pared with Whites.
Other studies reported similar, disturbing findings of
African Americans being under control of the criminal jus-
tice system. For instance, Beck and Mumola (1999) argued
that a Black male born in 1991 stood a 29% chance of being
imprisoned at some point in his life, compared with 4% for a
White male. They argued, similar to others, that African
Americans comprised 13% of the nation's population, yet
were imprisoned at 6.6 times the rate of Whites. In November
2012, Glaze and Parks (2011) of the Bureau of Justice statis-
Wells 3
tics reported that 6.98 million offenders were under the con-
trol of the criminal justice system.
Method
Research Site
The research site was Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The timeline
for collecting and analyzing the data from the three samples
was from the first week of May 2007 to September 2007.
The 2005 census American Community Survey indicated
that Milwaukee was 44.7% White and 40.2% African
American and that the Milwaukee African American popula-
tion had become the city's largest ethnic group.
The 2010 United States Census (Census) reported that the
city of Milwaukee was 39.2% African American, 3.5%
Asian, 17.3% Hispanic, and 37% White. The Census reported
that the city of Milwaukee experienced a .4% population
decrease since 2000.
Description of Sample: Experimental Audit Sites
and Participants
The job sites underwent two randomizations. The first came
from the initial random selection from the Milwaukee Journal
Sentinel and JobNet. The second randomization placed them
into the Criminal Record (CR) and No Criminal Record
(NCR) categories. This allowed each tester the opportunity
to frequent the same number of job sites. Plus, each tester
visited the same job site and both applied based on whether
the employer is randomized as CR or NCR. This allowed for
both the Black and White tester to visit the same job site
under the same experimental conditions (CR or NCR).
The goal was an equal number of trials for each tester. The
testers applied for 30 entry-level job openings. Fifteen were
CR and fifteen were NCR job sites. The dependent variable
is the number of call backs from the employer after receiving
the application. Also, an interview or a job offer is counted as
a positive contact.An average of 10 audits (5 CR and 5 NCR)
occurred a week. The rest of the week the testers called the
researcher by telephone to schedule their start.
Each tester received individual training on how to respond
to questions about a CR or NCR. The assigned criminal his-
tory of both testers was the same. The assigned criminal his-
tory was a conviction for possession of cocaine. Each tester
used a script to recite or write if they were questioned about
or had to give an explanation of their criminal record. The
Black male tester wrote or stated the following:
I was stopped by the police for a traffic violation. I ran a red
light. I was patted down after the traffic stop and the officer
found a small amount of cocaine in my pocket. I went to court
and pled guilty. The Judge told me that I had too good of a record
and education to be doing something so foolish. He informed me
that he was giving me six months in the House of Correction to
teach me a lesson.
The White male tester received the following script if
asked or required to give an explanation of his criminal
history:
I was at a party at a friend's apartment. The party got loud and
the police was called. I was patted down by an officer and a
small amount of cocaine was found in my pocket. I was arrested
and went to court where I pled guilty. The judge informed me
that he was going to teach me a lesson to keep me from making
a similar mistake in the future. He sentenced me to 6 months at
the House of Correction.
The Audit Process
The audit consisted of the testers reporting to one of the ran-
domly selected employers on their assigned list. If the job
site is a CR job site, the testers indicated on the application,
if required, an arrest for possession of cocaine. If required,
the testers included in the application the script regarding the
circumstances of the arrest and the disposition. The testers
did the same for any interview. If the audit site is designated
an NCR job site, the testers completed the application and
indicated, if required, no arrest or conviction history.
Each tester had a separate voice mail box to use on the
employment application. A call back to the voice mail box by
an employer was counted as a positive response. Also, if the
tester was interviewed or offered a job on-site this was con-
sidered a positive response.
Approach of the Study
The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of
a criminal history and race on the willingness to hire ex-
offenders. Pager (2003) suggested the use of the survey as
a measuring tool of employment discrimination may not
yield an accurate reflection of employers' hiring process.
Pager argued that the employers surveyed may answer
with the "political correct" response about their hiring
process, which may conflict with actual practices. The
current study will compare the employers expressing a
willingness to hire ex-offenders and their actual hiring of
ex-offenders.
The following research questions guided the study:
Research Question 1: What are the effects of a criminal
record in accessing employment opportunities?
Research Question 2: What is the impact of race in
accessing employment opportunities?
Research Question 3: To what extent does a discrepancy
exist between employers'expressed willingness to hire an
ex-offender and their actual hiring practices?
4 SAGE Open
The current study focused on the efforts of Black and
White ex-offenders to obtain employment in the city of
Milwaukee. The study used an experimental model to assess
the effects of a criminal record on employment. In addition,
it examined the use of a survey as a measurement tool for
discrimination.
The research consisted of three phases (an experimental
audit, a diary, and a telephone survey). The first phase
involved an experimental audit that included one Black and
one White male tester who applied for real entry-level jobs.
The testers were assigned to randomly selected employers
assigned a Criminal Record and No Criminal Record.
Moreover, in the second phase, the testers maintained a diary
of their experiences during the application process that was
analyzed using the constant comparative method (Creswell,
1998).
The third phase was a telephone survey administered to
the same employers that were audited. The survey provided
employers an opportunity to reveal their hiring processes. A
comparison was made of the employers' hiring practices
(experimental audit) and their expression of a willingness to
hire ex-offenders (survey).
Veenman (2010) examined research methods that studied
labor market discrimination that used statistical analyses,
behavioral research, ethnographic observations, and attitude
research. Veenman suggested that no one method was supe-
rior to the other, and found strength and limitations of each
method. Based on these findings, Veenman argued that
examinations of labor market discrimination should employ
multiple methods to support the reliability of the results. For
example, Veenman suggested using a combination of statis-
tical analyses of observational data and paired testing to
study the prevalence of discrimination and its impact on the
labor market.
Experimental audits of employers hiring practices simu-
late that part of the process in the real world. The audits
allowed for an examination of practices as they occur in the
labor market, as testers pose as applicants for real positions.
A test for discriminatory or illegal practices in housing dis-
crimination was conducted by the United States Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD; Turner & Ross,
2003). Turner and Ross maintain testers were matched based
on similar characteristics such as race, age, physical appear-
ance, and self-presentation. They were assigned similar char-
acteristics of education and work experience to apply for
rental units.
Both visited a real estate or rental agent, made the same
requests, and provided the same personal information. Each
tester systematically and carefully recorded the information
and assistance he or she received from the agent. If the
minority and White testers were treated differently in impor-
tant ways, the test provides direct and powerful evidence of
differences in the kinds of treatment that can be expected
when they search for housing. The current research used a
similar model to examine employment hiring practices in
Milwaukee.
Research Rationale--Experimental Audit
Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) concurred with Pager
(2003; Pager & Quillian, 2005) about surveys. They sug-
gested that surveys do not contain all the characteristics that
employers observe when hiring, promoting, or setting wages.
Bertrand and Mullainathan maintained that audit studies pro-
vided some of the "cleanest" non-laboratory evidence of
labor market discrimination.
According to Riach and Rich (2002), this use of testing
has been used for many years, and it is a valuable investiga-
tive technique. Testing has been described as a process of
presenting individuals with equal qualifications and similar
personal traits to the same employer (Bussey & Travina,
2003). The significant difference in the individuals was often
race or gender.
Research Rationale--Diary
In the current experimental audit, each tester maintained a
diary of his interaction with the employer.The testers recorded
their interactions with the employer or representative imme-
diately after leaving the premises. They recorded the day,
date, time, and location in their diary. They also recorded their
conversations with the employer or representative at each
site, as well as a physical description of each. Furthermore,
they recorded the approximate age, build, hair color, and
other characteristics to assist in identifying the individuals.
Constant comparative analysis was used to obtain data
relevant to the testers' interaction with the employers. Each
tester diary entry described the overall interaction with com-
ments made by the employer or representative. The diary
entries were read four times and the top three prominent
similarities or emergent themes were recorded.
Descriptive Data About Site: Telephone Survey
The third data sample was collected through the use of a tele-
phone survey administered to the same employers that were
audited. Data analysis of the telephone survey resulted in
descriptive statistics. The results were compared to the infor-
mation obtained from the other two phases, thereby increas-
ing the validity of the telephone survey.
The current telephone survey is an adjusted version of the
one used by Devah Pager (2003). Pager's (2003) survey was
reduced to those variables important to the present research
questions.
The telephone survey comprised of 28 multiple-choice
questions. It was designed to solicit responses regarding the
attitudes of employers about different kinds of applicants
for entry-level positions. The survey included questions
Wells 5
regarding the employer, the hiring procedures, and the
employer's attitudes about various kinds of applicants.
Examples of the questions asked were as follows:
Next, I am going to ask about several types of applicants. Please
tell me if you would accept each type for an entry-level position.
8. An applicant who is on welfare?
Would you say you definitely will accept, probably will accept,
probably will not accept, or absolutely will not accept? Don't
know­no opinion, Refused/no answer.
10. An applicant who had a criminal record?
Would you say you definitely will accept, probably will accept,
probably will not accept, or absolutely will not accept? Don't
know­no opinion, Refused/no answer.
The telephone survey was administered by a business
communication specialist who has many years of experience
conducting telephone interviews. The calls to the employers
yielded a response rate of 57%.
Data Collection/Analysis--Experimental Audit
This study used an experimental audit to produce data rele-
vant to the research questions. The experimental audit was
conducted by Black and White male testers who applied for
real entry-level jobs in the city of Milwaukee. The definition
for entry-level job opening included those that require no
previous experience and no education greater than high
school. Also, any position legally exempting an ex-offender
was not included. The testers were assigned job sites that had
been randomly selected as a criminal record or no criminal
record employer to examine the responses.
The variable measured was the number of call backs from
the employer after receiving the application. The appropri-
ateness of the methodology for the research was in its ability
to compare the experiences of testers and real ex-offenders
seeking employment. It also allowed for the examination of
the effect of race on employment opportunities. Yinger
(1986) described fair housing audits as a means of catching
individuals in the act of discrimination. Yinger maintained
the use of testers was an opportunity to measure discrimina-
tion while at the same time observing it in a natural setting.
Andersson, Jakobsson, and Kotsadam (2012) used a cor-
responding test for ethnic and gender discrimination in
housing in Norway. Andersson et al.'s design used faked let-
ters in response to apartments listed for rent in Norway. The
correspondence letters signaled to the reader the ethnicity,
gender, and socioeconomic class. Andersson et al.argued the
use of tests allowed for the examination and measurement of
discrimination parameters that would be impossible to
evaluate.
Others have used audits or correspondence testing to
examine discrimination. Johnson and Lahey (2011) used
matched pairs of resumes to examine hiring of older women
in entry-level positions. Johnson and Lahey compared the
use of audit studies to having a natural field experiment.
Furthermore, they compared it to humans in the real-world
where you are given the opportunity to examine the responses
to characteristics of race, gender, or age.
Paluck (2010) expressed a similar description of the real-
world richness of audit studies. Paluck agreed with Veenman
(2010) that the combination of the qualitative method and field
experiments presents the opportunity to have measurable data
and participant information in a controlled environment.
Neumark (2010) suggested the value of using audit stud-
ies in discrimination research. Neumark described audit or
correspondence studies as a means of establishing identical
characteristics in an application process except for race, gen-
der, or ethnicity. A review of the literature shows how others
use audit or correspondence studies to examine discrimina-
tion in the labor market, health care, housing, and education
in the United States and internationally (Andersson et al.,
2012; Kaas & Manger, 2012; McGinnity & Lunn, 2011;
Nunley, Owens, & Howard, 2011; Paluck, 2010; Stepanikova,
2012; Veenman, 2010).
For the current experimental sample, separate voice mail
telephone accounts were established for each tester to use on
the employment application. This was used for the employer
to call back the tester regarding the employment opportunity.
The call backs are the dependent variables. Analysis of the
data from the call backs was based on the number of
responses by criminal record and non-criminal record. In
addition, an analysis was done on the responses based on the
race of the tester. The data were analyzed using descriptive
statistics. This consisted of averages and percentages.
Pager (2003) used inferential statistics to analyze the call
backs received from the testers based on the race and crimi-
nal history of the tester. The current research analyzed the
call backs similar to Pager considering whether there was a
hiring preference based on race or criminal history. Also, the
sample of 30 employers and two testers are too small to have
confidence in the statistical significance of the comparison.
The study relied on descriptive ability of the results as
opposed to inferential power.
Statistics
The statistically significant difference is based on a sample
size of 30 employers and two testers. The sample size is
decreased even more when the 30 employers are divided into
15 CR and 15 NCR job sites. Therefore, the test for statistical
significance is only being used to support the descriptive
statistics.

Again, the test of statistical significance is used for
descriptive purposes. The sample size of 30 employers
divided evenly between two testers is a limitation in the cur-
rent research.
Research Results
The three most common job titles were Waitstaff (23%), cus-
tomer service representative (20%), and delivery driver
(20%). These job titles represented 63% of the sample. Auto
parts person, custodian, and lot attendant­auto made 21% of
the other job titles. This is followed by cashier, clerk/
shipping, laborer, auto lube, and warehouse accounting for
15% of the job titles.
Findings Related to Research Questions 1 and 2:
Experimental Audit
The experimental audit findings addressed the research ques-
tions about the effects of a criminal record and race on
employment opportunities in the city of Milwaukee for each
of the Testers.
The Effect of Race on Call Backs for the Testers
The current research (Figure 1) revealed the White male tes-
ter received 47% of his call backs when he applied for
employment with NCR compared with 40% when applying
for employment with a CR. The results show there was little
difference in the effect of a CR on the White tester for receiv-
ing call backs. The CR did not reduce the likelihood of a call
back for the White male tester. There was a statistically sig-
nificant difference (p < .05; significance level was set at the
.05 level) between the call backs for the Black and White
testers.
The race of the testers is examined to determine if differ-
ences occurred for Black tester when compared with the
White tester. The effect of race can be observed in Figure 2.
It can be observed the Black tester with NCR received 27%
of the call backs compared with 47% for the White testers. It
can also be observed the White tester with a CR received
40% of the call backs while the Black tester with a CR record
received no call backs. The results suggest that a Black male
without a criminal record is less likely to receive a call back
compared with a White male with a criminal record. Also, a
Black male with a CR will receive fewer call backs than a
White male with a CR.
A statistically significant difference (p < .05) exists
between employment opportunities based on CR in the
White and Black tester. But, there is no statistically signifi-
cant difference between a non-criminal record on employ-
ment opportunities in the White and Black testers.
After testing for the effect of a CR for the White tester, it
is concluded that there is no significant effect (p > .05) of a
CR for the White tester. But a test of significant effect of CR
for Black tester indicated there is a significant effect for the
Black tester. Moreover, the comparisons were made from a
sample of 30 employers.
There are limitations regarding the statistically signifi-
cance difference in all the findings attributed to the sample
size. Therefore, the test for statistical significance is only
being used to support the descriptive statistics.
Personal Contact: Interviews

parisons of personal contact by race. This is permissible

because the Black and White tester visited the same employ-
ers with the same characteristics except race. Figure 3 repre-
sents the percent of call backs associated with personal
contact. Personal contact is described as the employer inter-
viewing the tester or offering a job on the spot. Furthermore,
it could be extra dialogue with the tester and a subsequent
call back to the tester. It could also be dialogue or action that
favored one tester over the other. The only personal contacts
recorded in Figure 3 are those involving an interview.
Figure 3 reflects the frequency of the impact of personal
contact (interview). Personal interviews resulted in 20% of
the call backs for both the Black and White tester. Both tes-
ters received 10% of their responses from interviews. It is
important to note the Black tester received the majority of his
responses during personal contact (10%) compared with
3.3% call backs from voicemail. Voice mail box communica-
tions accounted for 36.6% of the call backs for both the
Black and White tester.
Findings Related to Research Question:
Telephone Survey
The final research question addressed employer expressed
willingness to hire and their actual hiring practices. Data
analysis of the telephone survey resulted in descriptive sta-
tistics. The first series of questions addressed background on
the company regarding its product or service and number of
employees. The next group of questions in Figure 4 addressed
the employer's application process. A component of Pager's
(2001) survey contained a vignette of hypothetical applicants
followed by a series of questions designed to examine the
employers' willingness to hire specific workers. It is impor-
tant to note that the analysis of the responses from the tele-
phone survey was based on a sample size of 57%.
Figure 4 indicates that 60% of the employers during the
telephone survey responded they always use a written appli-
cation. It also shows the same percentage of employers
(60%) who use a written application also conduct a personal
interview and verify references.
The next series of questions address the employers' atti-
tudes toward disadvantaged or stigmatized applicants.
Disadvantaged or stigmatized worker is defined as welfare
recipients, applicants with a GED but no high school
diploma, applicants with spotty work history, applicants who
have been unemployed for a year or more, and ex-offenders
(Holzer, 2003).
Figure 5 represents the responses to the telephone survey
questions regarding attitude toward hiring disadvantaged
workers. Figure 5 indicates that no employer responded with
an unwillingness to hire a disadvantaged worker. Every
respondent showed they "probably will" or "definitely will"
hire a disadvantage worker. The degree of commitment to
hire a disadvantage worker varied among the respondents.
More respondents (43.3%) indicated they "probably will"
hire applicant with a criminal record (AppCR) than "defi-
nitely will." The highest responses for having a positive atti-
tude toward a disadvantaged worker is GED (40%) followed
by Welfare (26.6%) and an applicant unemployed (UNEMP;
20%) for a year or more. Even though AppCR is the lowest
response for "definitely will," it is the highest response of
43.3% for "probably will."
The next series of questions asked about the employers'
application process when hiring employees into entry-level
positions that do not require a college degree. The employers
were asked during the telephone survey, "Over the past year,
how often have you required new hires for entry-level posi-
tions to take a drug test?" The majority of the respondents
(53.3%) indicated that they required a drug test. Another
3.3% indicated the drug test were required sometimes.
The next series of questions inquired into the employers'
application process when hiring into entry-level positions
and whether the applicant has a criminal history. The
employer is asked, "Over the past year, to your knowledge,
did the application form you used include a question about
the applicant's criminal background (that is, did you ask

them about any prior convictions they may have had)?" The
results showed that 46.7% of the respondents indicated that
their application solicited information about the criminal his-
tory of the applicants. Only 10% of the employers indicated
that they did not solicit information regarding the applicants'
criminal history.
The telephone survey asked, "When do you usually do the
criminal background check?" The results illustrated that
50% of the employers indicated they conduct a background
check "after applicant is interviewed, before hire." No
employer indicated they do the background check before the
applicant is interviewed.
The next question solicited the employers' frequency of
hiring an individual with a criminal record within the past
year. The employer is asked, "Approximately, how many
men with criminal records has your business hired in the past
year?" The employers' response indicated that 30% of the
employers hired 1 to 5 applicants with a CR within the past
year. Another 3.3% of the employers indicated that they
hired 11 to 15 applicants with a CR within the past year.
The next series of questions were from hypothetical appli-
cants for an entry-level position. The employer was read the
below directions and description of a hypothetical applicant.
The last group of questions was based on a profile that is
constructed to emphasize specific work and crime-related
characteristics. In one reading, the applicant is described as a
Black male named Chad. In the other reading, he was
described as a White male called Chad.
The following statement and series of questions were read
to the employer (Pager, 2001):
Now I'm going to describe some hypothetical applicants for an
entry-level opening you are trying to fill. Please indicate the
likelihood that you would hire the applicant in each case.
Chad is a 23-year-old Black male. He finished high school and
has had steady work experience in entry-level jobs. He has good
references and interacts well with people. About a year ago,
Chad was convicted of a drug felony and served 12 months in
prison. Chad was released last month and now is looking for a
job.
The telephone survey participants were read the above
vignette and then asked, "How likely would you be to hire
Chad for an entry-level opening in your company?" The
same vignette was read with Chad being a White male. The
only thing that changed in the vignette was race of Chad.
The frequency distribution for hiring an applicant with a
drug felony is illustrated in Table 1. BMDF represent the
vignette with Chad being a Black male with a drug felony.
WMDF represent the vignette with Chad being a White male
with a drug felony. BMDF is 6.7% "very likely" to hire and
this is the same for WMDF (6.7%). Only 6.7% of the respon-
dents indicated they were "very likely" to hire a Black male
or White male with a drug felony. The respondents indicated
("somewhat likely) a preference to hiring a WMDF (10%)
over a BMDF (6.7%).
The respondents indicated that a total of 13.3% of "some-
what unlikely" and "very unlikely" were unlikely to hire the
White Chad (WMDF) with a drug felony. This is compared
with a combined total of 23.3% of "somewhat unlikely" and
"very unlikely" who indicated they were unlikely to hire a
Black Chad (BMDF) with a drug felony.
The frequency of the responses to whether the employer
will hire an applicant who committed a property crime is in
Table 1. The respondents were asked, "Instead of a drug
crime, what if Chad had been in prison for a property crime
such as burglary?" The frequencies indicate the employers
responded very similar to hiring both the Black Chad and
White Chad with a record of a property crime. BMPC repre-
sents the vignette with Chad as a Black male who committed
the property crime instead of the drug crime. WMPC repre-
sents the vignette with Chad as a White male who committed
the property crime instead of the drug crime. The frequency
indicates a combined total of "very likely" to "somewhat
likely" of 13.3% for BMPC and 16.3% for WMPC to hire for
a property crime. Only 3% separate BMPC and WMPC. Yet,
20% of the employers reported they were "somewhat
unlikely" to "very unlikely" to hire either the Black male or
White male who committed a property crime.
Table 1 reflects the employers' responses to hiring the
hypothetical Chad who is convicted of a violent crime. The
employers indicated that Chad the Black male convicted of a
violent crime (BMVC) is not "very likely" to be hired in an
entry-level position. No respondent indicates they were
likely to hire Chad who is a BMVC. However, 10% of the

employers stated they were likely to hire the Chad who is a
White male convicted of a violent crime (WMVC).
Table 1 indicates that 10% of the respondent were "some-
what likely" to hire BMVC. Plus, more employers (16.7%)
were "very unlikely" to hire WMVC compared with 13.3%
for BMVC. But, if you compared the two negative responses
of "very unlikely" to "somewhat unlikely," the result is about
the same (16.7%).
Table 1 illustrates the employers responded similarly to
hiring hypothetical Chad whether he is a White male who
received drug treatment (WMDT) or a Black male who
received drug treatment (BMDT). The employers indicated
they were "somewhat likely" (26.7%) to hire either Chad
who had completed drug treatment.
The same vignette is read to the employers with Chad as
a White male and Chad as a Black male who instead of being
released from prison last month, Chad had gotten out of
prison 6 months ago and had been working at a car wash
since his release. Table 2 illustrates the frequency of the
employers'responses. Twenty percent of the employers indi-
cated they were "very likely" to hire White Chad (WMEXP)
and 16.7% of the respondents indicated they were likely to
hire Black Chad (BMEXP). It should be noted that 30% of
the respondents indicated they "somewhat likely" hire
WMEXP compared to 33.3% of the respondents indicating
they "somewhat likely" hire BMEXP. There is no statisti-
cally significant difference (p > .05) between proportions of
WMEXP and BMEXP for combined effect of "somewhat
likely" to hire with work experience.
The use of the vignette during the telephone survey gave
the employers an opportunity to state their willingness or
unwillingness to hire a Black or White male under different
hypothetical circumstances. What can be concluded from the
responses is a willingness of the employers to treat both
applicants the same. Their responses indicated that there is
an unwillingness to hire either the Black or White male for
criminal behavior. The level of unwillingness increases
based on the seriousness of the offense. But, there is little
difference in their willingness on the basis of race.
Again, there are limitations associated with the statisti-
cally significance difference in the findings. There were 30
employers involved in the study. The telephone survey did
not include all of the employers because some did not want
to participate in the survey. Therefore, the sample size is too
small for any meaningful test of significance.
Comparison of the Results From the Audit,
Diaries, and Telephone Survey
The current study examined the relationship between find-
ings from the audit study, diary entries, and telephone survey.
The data came from the same employers who participated in
the audit and the telephone survey.
The audit revealed that the criminal record for the White
male tester had little effect on his call backs. The White male
tester received 40% of his call backs when applying for
employment with a criminal record. The audit also revealed
that the White tester received 47% of his call backs when he
applied for employment with no criminal record. However,
the effect of a criminal record is substantially different for
the Black male tester. The audit revealed that the Black male
tester received no call backs when applying for employment
with a criminal record. He received 27% of the call backs
when he applied for employment with no criminal record.
These findings were supported by the specific entries into
the diaries of the testers (Wells, 2013). This data reflected
that the employers and their representatives favored the
White male tester who received more interviews from per-
sonal contact. For instance, it became apparent that the gate-
keepers were favoring the White tester. The Black tester was
denied applications while data supported that the White tes-
ter received an application from the same person. There was
also evidence in behavior notations to support that this was
intentional on the part of the employee (Wells, 2013).
A telephone survey was used to identify those who indi-
cated a willingness to hire ex-offenders with a drug convic-
tion during the telephone survey and compared their verbal
responses to their actual behavior in the audit. The results
revealed 73% of the criminal record job site employers par-
ticipated in the telephone survey. The analysis revealed 36%
of the criminal record job site employers participating in the
survey indicated a willingness to hire an applicant with a
criminal record and a drug conviction regardless of race.
Also, 55% of the same respondents reported an unwilling-
ness to hire an applicant of either race if they were convicted
of a drug offense. The results indicated that the willingness
to hire or not was influenced by race.
Discussion
Devah Pager (2003) and Pager and Quillian (2005) reported
that a White male with a criminal record received more call
backs than a Black male with no criminal record. The current
study supported the findings of Pager. This study examined
the effects of a criminal record and race on employment
opportunities in the city of Milwaukee.Another aspect was the

investigation of employers' willingness to hire disadvantaged
applicants. The related research questions were as follows:
Research Question 1: What are the effects of a criminal
record in accessing employment opportunities?
Research Question 2: What is the impact of race in
accessing employment opportunities?
Research Question 3: What is the relationship between
employers' expressed willingness to hire an ex-offender
and their actual hiring practices?
The following will be a discussion of each of the above
research questions.
Effects of a Criminal Record and Race
Questions regarding a criminal record and race were exam-
ined by conducting an experimental audit. Two testers, one
Black male and one White male, went to the same job site
seeking employment. They presented themselves with the
same qualifications at each job site. Job sites were divided
through randomization evenly as a Criminal Record or No
Criminal Record job site. The only major difference in the
two testers is race.
The effect of race in these findings is strikingly large. The
Black tester without a criminal record received only 27% call
backs relative to 47% of White tester. In fact, the White tester
with a criminal record received more favorable treatment
(40%) than the Black tester without a criminal record (27%).
It is obvious that the results indicate race favor the White
male tester. Race continues to play a dominant role in shap-
ing employment opportunities, it is equal to or greater than
the impact of a criminal record. The major finding is there is
little difference in the effects of a criminal record on the
White tester for receiving call backs.
The results indicate that when compared with their White
counterparts, Blacks are considered for employment little
less than half as much. Also, Black males without a criminal
record will do considerably worse than White males with
prior criminal convictions. The compelling effects of race
thus continue to direct employment decisions in ways that
contribute to persisting racial inequality. When the effects of
race and criminal record are combined, the problem grows
more intense. Not only are Black male more likely to be
incarcerated than Whites; according to these findings, they
may also be more strongly affected by the impact of a crimi-
nal record. The results were blatant and shocking that when
all else is held equal but race, the employers preferred the
White tester.
Emotional Effect
An unexpected consequence of the audit study was the nega-
tive emotional effect of the process on the Black male tester.
Both testers recorded their experiences with the application
process. The Black male tester recorded instances of being
screened prior to receiving an application, treated rude, and
told positions were filled when they were not (Wells, 2013).
This emotional effect was documented in the Black tester
diaries and debriefings.
The effect is consistent with the description of race-
related stress described by Pieterse and Carter (2007). They
argued that Black Men have a higher incidence of discrimi-
nation than Black Women. Pieterse and Carter suggest that
race related-stress is a by-product of discrimination and
should be included in mental and physical health-related
examinations and inquiries.
The debriefings and diary entries of the Black male tester
revealed how these experiences had a negative emotional
effect on him. The effect was attributed to the constant rejec-
tion and negative behavior of the gatekeepers toward the
Black tester. The diaries exposed a dark side of the employ-
ment application process. It showed employees at the lowest
level of the business screening out applicants (Wells, 2013).
Expressed Willingness to Hire Ex-Offenders and
Their Actual Hiring of Ex-Offender
Atelephone survey was used to examine the employers'will-
ingness to hire disadvantaged workers. The survey was con-
ducted from the same employers visited by the testers under
the experimental audit. The responses indicated all employ-
ers were willing to hire a disadvantaged worker. This
included applicants with a drug felony.
It is clear from the current research that employers will
respond to a survey favorably toward hiring ex-offenders.
This is contrary to their actual practice. When faced with hir-
ing an African American with a drug offense on his record,
no one called back the Black tester. The current research is
consistent with others who question the legitimacy of
responses to the sensitive nature of race in a survey (Bertrand
& Mullainathan, 2003; Bussey & Travina, 2003; Pager &
Quillian, 2005; Yinger, 1986).
The responses in the telephone survey were compared to
the findings in the audit. The respondents in the survey indi-
cated a willingness to hire a Black male with a drug felony at
a higher frequency than the actual experience. In the audit,
the Black male tester received no call backs from the
Criminal Record Job sites. Also, the respondents indicated in
the survey they were willing to hire both Black and White
applicants at the same frequency (6.7%).Yet, in the audit, the
White male tester received 40% of his call backs, while the
Black male tester received none.
Findings Compared to Related Literature
There is a good body of literature regarding the effects of
criminal history, race, and willingness to hire ex-offenders in
Wells 11
the labor market. The current research supported the research
that argued there was a negative effect on employment
opportunities in the labor market for ex-offenders and minor-
ities. Also, the study supports the research that suggested that
the survey should not be the only device measuring employ-
ment discrimination. The literature will attest to the enormity
of the problem of a criminal record, race, and employment.
Measuring Employment Discrimination
Veenman (2010) argued that examinations of labor market
discrimination should employ multiple methods to support
the reliability of the results. The existing study used an
experimental audit, diaries and debriefings, and a telephone
survey to investigate the effect of a criminal history and race
on employment in the Milwaukee labor market.
The findings reinforced the themes that unemployment
among ex-offenders impact the measurement of racial dis-
crimination in employment. Furthermore, multiple means of
inquiry are important to discern labor market discrimination.
The results are consistent with other researchers who suggest
that the use of a survey as a measuring tool of employment
discrimination may not yield an accurate reflection of
employers' hiring practices (Pager & Quillian, 2005; Yinger,
1986). It is necessary to use multiple techniques that include
experimental audits if we are going to uncover hidden pro-
cesses and information impacting labor market discrimina-
tion. It was evident in the current research that the audit of
employers yielded information that is not easily obtained
with a survey. The audit results is strong support for the per-
spective that information obtained from testing is a direct
measure of discrimination. Also, the audit allowed for a
unique opportunity to examine discrimination first-hand in a
real-word setting. This could not be done with a survey. The
personal contact between the testers and the employer or rep-
resentative was captured in a meaningful way through the
use of diary recordings (Wells, 2013).
It is important to recognize that employment discrimina-
tion remain a problem in the workplace for ex-offenders. The
failure to adequately monitor and measure discrimination by
employers is a major concern. It was observed in the current
research that the actions of the employer representative could
lead to legitimate allegations of discrimination. Allowing
unqualified employees to question potential applicants
regarding their criminal history can lead to a violation of the
anti-employment discrimination law (Wells, 2013). The level
of these practices extends to human resource managers and
owners. It is disturbing that a human resource manager inter-
viewed an applicant on the basis of a recommendation from
the receptionist and another because she thought she had a
friend who went to school with the applicant's brother. If
these practices are allowed to continue, it will result in fewer
AfricanAmericans and other minorities in the workplace, the
responsibility rests with the employers, management, and
regulatory agencies.
Limitations
The research revealed the impact of a criminal record and
race on employment and wages of ex-offenders. If a White
male with a criminal record has a greater chance of gaining
employment than a Black male without a criminal record,
this suggests that discrimination in hiring should be a major
concern for policy makers. Yet, there are some limitations to
the current study. The limitations pertain to the parameters
under which a study is conducted as well as the areas the
research did not intend to address (Leedy & Ormrod, 2005).
One limitation of the study is the experimental audit
model, which has not been frequently used to examine
employment discrimination. This model is more commonly
used in examining discrimination in housing, insurance
redlining, and mortgage brokerage.
Another limitation of the study is the sample. The sample
size of 30 employers divided into two equal groups is too
small for substantive inferential statistics. This is not reflec-
tive of the diverse job market in the study area.
The current research used only two testers, thus limiting
the comparison to only two subjects. Also, the research was
restricted to Black and White male testers. The current study
did not consider the effect a criminal history would have on
women and other minority groups.
The testers received training in seeking employment. Yet,
once the testers entered into the job site, their actual practices
were not observed, thus presenting another limitation. For
example, the entries in their diaries represent only one side of
the interaction.
The research was restricted to only employers who
accepted applications in-person. Many employers require
applicants to apply online. Also, many employers use
employment agencies or job-services to screen applicants.
This eliminated a number of employers from the study. Both
processes make it difficult to make generalization regarding
employers' hiring practice.
The limitations in the current research should be ade-
quately examined in future research. The main focus of the
current research was on African American males because it
was reported that one in three Black men was under some
form of criminal justice control in 1995 (Mauer, 1995).
Implications
The current research extends our knowledge of the effect of
a criminal history and race in the labor market. It also
addresses research that relies on the trustworthiness of sur-
vey responses. The findings have implications for practice,
research, leadership, learning, and service.
Government Enforcement
Government oversight is grossly missing in the area of
employment discrimination based on race and criminal
12 SAGE Open
history in the Milwaukee area. The government needs to
establish testing procedures for unlawful employment prac-
tices similar to those in this study and housing discrimination.
If employers do not police themselves, then they must be
policed. Testing is a legitimate means of policing employers.
Probation and Parole Agencies
It is a common practice for probation and parole agents to
require their clients (ex-offenders) to seek employment.
Yet, no system is in place to monitor whether the employer
is unlawfully rejecting the client. The agents can sanction
the clients for not seeking employment but do not
report employers who unlawfully reject their clients.
Documentation can result in identifying those employers
engaging in a pattern of discrimination. An effort should be
made to gather information on those employers not hiring
ex-offenders and why. A cooperative effort must be estab-
lished between the Wisconsin Division of Community
Corrections and the state agency responsible for investigat-
ing discrimination in employment.
Implications for Research
The current study has implications for further research
related to replication and generalization. Both are impor-
tant for the credibility of research findings. A larger sam-
ple is needed to examine the impact of discrimination in
urban cities. Furthermore, the larger sample can include
an examination of diverse groups of employers. The
majority of the employers in the current study are small
business owners.
Further research should also include employers who are
using online computer applications. This process virtually
eliminates "real-life" experiences and personal contact. How
are they screening their applicants for elimination? Research
should be expanded to include women, Asian, and Latino
testers. Replications including these groups can be used to
determine if there are similar effects of discrimination based
on gender, race, and criminal history.
Generalization
There is a need for the current research to be expanded to
other cities. It is important to determine if the responses are
unique for Milwaukee. The study can be replicated to further
examine "real-life" experiences of applicants. The diary
method (Wells, 2013) is an effective model when data are
regularly analyzed using the constant comparative method.
Testers can be manipulated based on race and gender, and
other purposeful factors. Similar findings in other cities shall
signal a national problem in discrimination. Moreover, other
cities with a different ethnic, racial, and economic make-up
may yield different results.
Conclusion
The findings revealed during the experimental audit that a
CR and NCR had no effect on the call backs for the White
male tester. The Black male tester received no call backs
with a CR. The Black male tester with NCR received fewer
call backs than the White male with NCR. The telephone sur-
vey revealed over 43% of the employers indicated they
"probably will" hire an applicant with a CR, but, only 13%
indicated they "definitely will" hire an applicant with a CR.
The results of the telephone survey pointed out that no
employer indicated they were unlikely not to hire a disadvan-
taged worker. Again, the employers expressed willingness to
hire or not to hire was not consistent with their actual
practices.
There were events during the audit that could not be cap-
tured using merely survey methods. For example, in some
cases the Black male tester was denied applications, was
subjected to a pre-application screening, and was told posi-
tions were filled. Yet, at one job site the Black male tester
was praised by an African American manager as being one of
the most qualified applicants he had seen in 2 years but still
did not get a call back. In another case, an African American
employer offered to make sure the application of the Black
male tester got to the manager. He also told him how to fol-
low-up on the process. The Black male tester received a call
back from the employer (Wells, 2013).
