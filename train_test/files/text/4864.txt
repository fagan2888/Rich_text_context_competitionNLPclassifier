Measuring the Evolutionarily Important
Goals of Situations: Situational Affordances
for Adaptive Problems
Nicolas A. Brown1, Rebecca Neel2, and Ryne A. Sherman1
Abstract
According to the Fundamental Motives Framework, basic goals such as protecting oneself, forming coalitions, and avoiding disease
have emerged as a result of evolutionary processes to enhance reproductive fitness. This article introduces the Situational
Affordances for Adaptive Problems (SAAP), a measure of situation characteristics that promotes or prevents the achievement of
these evolutionarily important goals. In Study 1, participants rated a recent situation they encountered using a preliminary version
of the SAAP. Using factor analysis, the measure was reduced to 28 items. In Study 2, the factor structure was confirmed. Studies 3
and 4 evaluated the psychometric properties of the measure including its predictive validity. Future studies can use the SAAP to
investigate differences in the everyday experience of these fundamental motives.

Introduction
Every day people find themselves in a number of different
contexts or situations, which provide both opportunities and
obstacles or affordances (Gibson, 1979; McArthur & Baron,
1983; Neuberg, Kenrick, & Schaller, 2010) for achieving one's
goals. For example, spending an evening at a bar can provide
an opportunity to relax, to spend time with one's romantic
partner, and to enjoy oneself. The situation can also include
obstacles to achieving those goals in the form of another bar
patron flirting with your romantic partner. Despite decades of
research purporting the power of the situation as a determinant
of behavior (e.g., Mischel, 1968; Ross & Nisbett, 1991),
research identifying the psychological properties of situations
has been sorely lacking (Frederiksen, 1972; Funder, 2001,
2006, 2008; Hogan, 2009; Johnson, 1999). Unlike the Big Five
or HEXACO models of personality psychology, there is no
consensus as to a common set of characteristics (i.e., a taxon-
omy) that researchers can and should use to measure the wide
variety of situations humans encounter (Hogan, 2009; Reis,
2008).
This is not to suggest that researchers have not tried to
remedy this issue. Several efforts have been made to identify
situation taxonomies using empirical approaches (Rauthmann
et al., 2014; Sherman, Nave, & Funder, 2010; Yang, Read, &
Miller, 2006). The application of the lexical hypothesis, the
notion that meaningful differences will be encoded in lan-
guage, to situations has been met with mixed results. In an
early study, Van Heck (1984) searched Dutch dictionaries for
words relevant to situational features. A subsequent cluster
analysis suggested 10 types of situations such as ``intimacy,''
``recreation,'' and ``interpersonal conflict'' (Van Heck, 1984).
More recently, Edwards and Templeton (2005) asked univer-
sity students to rate a set of dictionary words that completed the
phrases, ``That situation was ____.'' and ``That was a ____
situation.'' Their factor analysis revealed four types of situa-
tions--positivity, negativity, goal achievement, and socializa-
tion (Edwards & Templeton, 2005). Yet another lexically
oriented approach used Chinese idioms as a basis for a situation

taxonomy (Yang et al., 2006). Interestingly, a cluster analysis
of these idioms revealed two dimensions of situations as initi-
ating or constraining goals (Yang et al., 2006), aligning with
the notion of situations as affordances for goal achievement.
Indeed, this same group of researchers later suggested that
situations be conceptualized in terms of the goals a person is
attempting to achieve (Yang, Read, & Miller, 2009).
An alternative empirical approach for conceptualizing
situations is to consider what basic situational features allow
for the expression of personality characteristics. One such
measure, the Riverside Situational Q-sort (RSQ; Sherman
et al., 2010; Wagerman & Funder, 2009), was developed
along these lines. Most recently, Rauthmann and colleagues
(2014) factor analyzed the RSQ across several diverse sam-
ples (e.g., community members and different cultures) and
identified eight dimensions of situations, provisionally
named DIAMONDS. These include, duty (whether a task
needs to be accomplished), mating (the presence of potential
romantic partners), and sociality (the potential to commu-
nicate with others and/or to form close relationships) to
name a few.
Theoretically Derived Situation Taxonomies
As an alternative to such empirical efforts to identify and quan-
tify meaningful features of situations, one might begin with a
theory that offers a set of specific predictions about how situa-
tions may be related to individual's cognitions, emotions,
and behavior. Perhaps the most prominent example to date
using this approach is the Atlas Of Interpersonal Situations
(H. Kelley et al., 2003). This taxonomy uses six dimensions
identified by interdependence theory (H. H. Kelley & Thibaut,
1978; Thibaut & Kelley, 1959) to ``define 20 of the most com-
mon situations encountered in ordinary social life'' (Reis, 2008,
p. 317). The situation taxonomy provided by interdepen-
dence theory is grounded in social exchange theories and,
as such, is useful for understanding behavior in social
exchange situations. The Fundamental Motive Framework
(Kenrick, Griskevicius, Neuberg, & Schaller, 2010), on the
other hand, offers a more distal perspective--grounded in
human evolution--that is useful for explaining behavior
oriented toward goals relevant to recurrent adaptive problems.
Thus, a situation taxonomy grounded in the fundamental
motives framework ought to be useful for understanding beha-
vior in situations that promote or prevent the achievement of
goals with relevance for fitness.
A Taxonomy of Situations Based on Evolutionary Theory
Over our species' history, humans have faced a number of
recurrent adaptive problems, including avoiding disease, pro-
tecting oneself, forming groups and allies, gaining status,
attracting and retaining mates, and caring for one's kin. These
are adaptive problems in the sense that people who caught
diseases were grievously injured, did not form successful alli-
ances with others, were of low status, failed to mate, lost their
mate, or did not invest in kin, were at a fitness disadvantage
relative to others who more successfully navigated these obsta-
cles, and thus were less likely to pass on their genes. Kenrick
and colleagues (Kenrick, 2011; Kenrick, Li, & Butner, 2003;
Kenrick, Griskevicius, et al., 2010; Kenrick, Neuberg, Griske-
vicius, Becker, & Schaller, 2010) posit that these recurrent
adaptive problems shaped human motivation, and the ensuing
motives are therefore fundamental. In other words, people
have at least seven core social motivations or goals: self-
protection, disease avoidance, affiliation,1 status, mate seek-
ing, mate retention, and kin care. Indeed, it has been argued
that such adaptive problems ``define situations'' (Buss, 2009,
p. 241). Because these goals are shaped to help an individual
address the recurrent adaptive problems of social life, it stands
to reason that modern humans bring this psychological
endowment to the perception and navigation of social situa-
tions today.
Situational Affordances for Adaptive
Problems
A number of laboratory experiments have shown that (some-
times subtle) situation changes (or manipulations) to temporar-
ily activate each of the fundamental motives lead to
predictable, motive-consistent, changes in thought and beha-
vior (e.g., Griskevicius et al., 2009; Griskevicius, Tybur, &
Van den Bergh, 2010; Maner et al., 2005; Maner, Gailliot,
Rouby, & Miller, 2007). However, no concise instrument pre-
sently exists that can measure situational affordances for these
seven goals in everyday situations.
Researchers have attempted to use existing situation mea-
sures to tap the fundamental motives in situations. A recent
study demonstrated that the RSQ can be used to indirectly
assess the extent to which situations are relevant to the funda-
mental motives (Morse, Neel, Todd, & Funder, In press). How-
ever, their results indicated that the RSQ may lack content
coverage in the domains of disease avoidance (i.e., only a
single item seems relevant at face value) and kin care (i.e.,
no items in the RSQ refer to helping one's family members).
This is perhaps unsurprising because the RSQ was not designed
to measure the presence of pathogens or to distinguish between
who (specifically) is receiving help. Furthermore, the full RSQ
consists of 81 items (version 2.0; version 3.15 contains 89),
which may not be feasible to administer in many research
endeavors.
If researchers seek to quantify the motive-relevant affor-
dances of situations and thus bring the study of these situations
to life domains beyond the laboratory, a concise and easily
administered measure provides an essential tool. The present
research is designed to fill this void through the development of
the Situational Affordances for Adaptive Problems (SAAP). In
this article, we discuss the development of the SAAP in both a
community (Study 1) and a college sample (Study 2), in addi-
tion to psychometric properties such as reliability (Study 3);
discriminant validity (Study 4); and convergent, incremental,
and predictive validity (Studies 3 and 4).
2 Evolutionary Psychology
Study 1: Item Creation and Scale
Development
Purpose
Study 1 was designed to accomplish two goals. First, it was our
intent to create a pool of items that could ostensibly measure the
characteristics of situations that might promote or prevent
achievement of the seven goals just mentioned. We used
Kenrick and colleagues' (2003) operational definitions of the
seven goals as a guide in generating items for the SAAP. We
also considered prior research, which indicates that several of the
goals contain lower order subfactors (Neel, Kenrick, White, &
Neuberg, In press). To guide participants to rate their immediate
context, and not perform a global assessment of their general
daily life, item phrases were written with the stem ``In this
situation . . . '' (e.g., ``In this situation . . . .sharing with others
is important''). After refining and rewording, our initial measure
consisted of 85 items (available in Supplemental materials).
Because the item content of this measure intentionally
included semantic similarity and because of a desire to develop
a shorter measure of these seven broad constructs, our second
goal was to empirically reduce the initial 85-item set to a
28-item version, with 4 items for each construct. We chose
4 items in an effort to balance adequate internal consistency,
scale length, and goal affordance content coverage. To do so,
we asked an adult Internet sample to recall and describe a recent
situation they experienced and then to rate that situation using
the initial 85-item measure. A number of exploratory factor
analyses were then used to identify the best 4 items per motive
that could comprise a reduced 28-item version of our measure.
Participants
Sample size selection. Ineachofthestudies,weaimedtogatherdata
from N ¼ 200 participants because this provides a 95% confidence
interval (CI) for a Fisher's transformed r of approximately +.14,
which is an acceptable level of precision in our view. Past experi-
ence with these populations suggests a 10% exclusion rate,2 thus
we gathered data from 220 participants in each study.
Two hundred and twenty participants were recruited from
Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT). Twenty-one participants
were excluded prior to analyses because they wrote descrip-
tions that included more than one situation (e.g., ``I was doing
my daily running outside and followed it up with a quick
shower and then went to bed.''). The final sample comprised
94 males and 105 females (M age ¼ 33.20 years, SD ¼ 12.36).
The ethnic breakdown for the sample was 80% Caucasian, 6%
African American, 5.5% Asian, 5.5% Hispanic/Latino/Latina,
and 3% Other. Participants were compensated US$0.50 for
completing the study. The study was approved by the institu-
tional review board (IRB) at Florida Atlantic University.
Measures and Procedure
Participants responded to the posting of a human intelligence
task (HIT) on the AMT website, which was only viewable to
individuals with an IP address in the United States (for a
further explanation of AMT for psychological research, see
Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011).3 After completing a
brief demographics questionnaire, participants were instructed
to recall a situation they experienced the previous day at the
same time they were taking the survey (24-hr prior). Partici-
pants were prompted to recall specific details of the situation
with the following instructions: ``Please include: (1) what you
were doing, (2) where you were, and (3) who was with you.''
The instructions requested participants recall only one situation.
To that end, we provided a hypothetical response (``I got home
from school, went shopping with my mom, and then had
dinner'') and provided instructions to write only about one thing
they were doing (``I was shopping at the mall with my mom'').
We also instructed participants that if they were sleeping at the
indicated time, they should write down what they were doing
right before they went to sleep or right after they woke up.
Participants rated their situation on the 85-item version of
the SAAP using a 5-point Likert-type scale to rate each item
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Items were
presented in a random order for each participant.
Analytic Strategies
As mentioned previously, the aim of one study was to reduce
the 85 items to a 28-item measure (4 per construct) that both
represented the content of the seven goals' affordances and
yielded reliable composite scores. In doing so, we employed
three different analytic strategies.
One-factor solutions. One method of identifying items with the
best 4 items for each goal was to calculate the first unrotated
principal component for each subset of items intended to pro-
mote or prevent the same goals. Based on the resulting unrotated
pattern matrix, we selected the four highest loading items. This
strategy maximizes internal consistency (i.e., coefficient a), so
long as the items consist of one construct, while potentially
sacrificing breadth in item content (e.g., a bloated specific).
Four-factor solutions. To identify items that could best maximize
content breadth, we again grouped the items by goal, but this
time extracted four principal components using a varimax rota-
tion and retained the highest loading item from each compo-
nent. This strategy resulted in the lowest possible reliability, so
long as the items consist of one construct, while maximizing
item content coverage.
Part-whole solutions. Using the part-whole function available in
the ``multicon'' package (Sherman, 2015) in R (R Development
Core Team, 2015), we computed all of the possible 4-item
combinations for each subset of items, created their respective
composites, and correlated them with the full-scale total score
using all of the items (i.e., all possible part-whole correlations).
We then selected the 4-item combination that correlated the
highest with the full scale. This approach was designed to
identify the 4 items that could best represent the full scale,
without particularly focusing on reliability or content coverage.
Brown et al. 3
Results
The 4-item sets, coefficient a, and correlation with the entire
scale for these three analytic strategies are available in the
Supplemental materials. We first evaluated the 4-item sets for
each situation domain based on their internal consistency and
correlation with the total scale. We dropped the four-factor
solutions from consideration because they did not appreciably
increase content coverage. Additionally, although we had
written items to measure subfacets of the affiliation and
mate-seeking constructs (e.g., Neel et al., In press), exploratory
factor analyses demonstrated that these items cross loaded on
more than one factor. These items were subsequently dropped
from further consideration.
Because the one-factor solutions produced sets of items that
covered nonoverlapping content, we used these solutions for all
seven motives. The resulting 28-item measure is presented in
the Appendix. Table 1 presents the intercorrelations, reliabil-
ities, means, and standard deviations (SDs) for each of the
respective composites for the final measure. The means for
males and females for each factor did not vary in a consistent
pattern (in this sample and in the subsequent samples) and are
thus not considered further. To explore the adequacy of our
28-item set, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis using
the ``Lavaan'' package (Rosseel, 2012) in R with full informa-
tion maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation.4 Three fit indices
were calculated to evaluate our model fit: root mean square
error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI),
and the Tucker­Lewis index (TLI). All three indicated ade-
quate fit: w2(329) ¼ 683.552, p < .001, RMSEA ¼ .074 (90%
CIs: [.066, .081]), CFI ¼ .906, and TLI ¼ .891. Of course, these
fit indices should only be considered descriptive as this model
fit was based on the results of exploratory procedures on the
same data set. Thus, we attempted to confirm this factor struc-
ture in Study 2.
Study 2: Confirming Factor Structure
Purpose
Following the exploratory analyses of the Study 1, we sought to
obtain an additional sample to confirm the factor structure of
the SAAP. Additionally, to examine convergent validity of the
SAAP, participants completed a measure of the psychological
properties of situations, the RSQ (Wagerman & Funder, 2009).
However, to save room and reduce overlap with results from a
later study examining convergent validity (Study 3), we do not
report convergent correlations with the RSQ here (also avail-
able in Supplemental materials).
Participants
Two hundred undergraduate participants from Florida Atlantic
University were recruited through fliers posted in the psychol-
ogy department. Eleven participants were excluded from anal-
yses: 10 participants wrote descriptions that included more than
1 situation. One participant completed the study twice, and his
or her additional data were not included in the final analyses.
Twenty-five participants were missing data on some measures.
Therefore, the sample sizes vary depending on the specific
analysis. The final sample comprises 119 females, 69 males,
and 1 who did not indicate. The mean age was 18.74 years
(SD ¼ 1.88), with an ethnicity breakdown of 51% Caucasian,
18% African American, 17% Hispanic/Latino/Latina, 10%
Other, 3% Asian, and 1% no response. Participants were com-
pensated with partial course credit. The study was approved by
the Institutional Review Board at Florida Atlantic University.
Measures
SAAP. The 85-item version of the SAAP administered to parti-
cipants in Study 1 was used in this study. As in Study 1, parti-
cipants used a 5-point Likert-type scale to rate each item from
1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Items were pre-
sented in a random order for each participant.
Procedure
Participants came to the lab and completed all parts of the study
using computerized survey software. The procedure for the first
part of Study 1 parallels that of the Pilot Study. Namely, after
completing a demographics questionnaire, participants were
asked to recall a situation they experienced the previous day
at the same time they were taking the survey (24 hr prior).

4 Evolutionary Psychology
Participants were again prompted to recall specific details of
the situation with the following instructions: ``Please include:
(1) what you were doing, (2) where you were, and (3) who was
with you.'' The instructions requested participants recall only
one situation. If participants indicated they were sleeping at the
indicated time, they were instructed to write down what they
were doing right before they went to sleep or right after they
woke up.5
Results
Table 1 presents the intercorrelations, coefficient a, means, and
SDs for each of the seven SAAP factors based on the items
identified in Study 1.
Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs)
To investigate the fit of the 28-item measure identified in Study
1, we used the Lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012) in R to conduct
a CFA with FIML estimation. Because many of the latent
factors are correlated to some degree (e.g., mate seeking and
mate retention) and there is no theoretical rationale suggesting
they should be orthogonal, we allowed all of the latent factors
to covary in our model. We again calculated the RMSEA, CFI,
and TLI fit indices to evaluate model fit. All three indicated
good fit: w2(329) ¼ 594.429, p < .001, RMSEA ¼ .065 (90%
CIs: [.057, .074]), CFI ¼ .918, and TLI ¼ .906.
Discussion
The goal of Study 2 was to confirm the factor structure of the
measure identified in Study 1. Using three different fit indices,
we found that the factor structure fits adequately in a less
heterogeneous sample (e.g., young university students). While
the obtained internal consistencies for the seven factors were
also adequate, coefficient a is not always the best indicator of
reliability (McCrae, Kurtz, Yamagata, & Terracciano, 2011).
Study 3 was designed to examine other psychometric proper-
ties such as test­retest stabilities, convergent, incremental, and
predictive validity.
Study 3: Examining Test­Retest Reliability
and Convergent Validity
Purpose
The objective of Study 3 was three-fold. First, both Study 1 and
Study 2 showed that the internal consistencies of the seven-
factor composites were acceptable. However, a more relevant
indicator of reliability is the stability of scores obtained from
ratings separated by time (McCrae et al., 2011). This study
examines the test­retest reliabilities of the SAAP over the
course of approximately 1 week. Second, this study evaluates
the convergent validity of the SAAP with another measure of
situations, the S8* (Rauthmann & Sherman, In press). The S8*
is an optimized measure of the aforementioned DIAMONDS
situation characteristics recovered from the RSQ by Rauth-
mann and colleagues (2014). Finally, this study examines the
convergent and incremental predictive validity of the SAAP in
predicting behaviors related to the seven goal-affordance
motives.
Participants
Time 1 Sample. Two hundred and twenty participants were
recruited from AMT. Twenty-three participants were excluded
prior to analyses: 15 participants who did not pass the survey's
validity checks6 (e.g., marking 5 to an item that asked partici-
pants to mark 1) were excluded. Five participants wrote
descriptions that included more than one situation, and one
participant completed the S8* but not the SAAP. Furthermore,
the random time selection software malfunctioned for two par-
ticipants. Because participants were given the option to not
respond to any particular survey item, sample sizes vary
depending on the specific analysis. The final sample comprised
97 males and 100 females. The average age was 37.11 years
(SD ¼ 12.92). The ethnic breakdown for the sample was 73%
Caucasian, 10% Asian, 9% African American, 5% Hispanic/
Latino/Latina, and 3% Other. Participants were compensated
US$0.75 for completing the first part of the study. The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Florida
Atlantic University.
Time 2 Sample. All two hundred and twenty participants in the
Time 1 sample were invited to participate in the Time 2 sample.
Of these, 188 (85%) completed the second part of the study.
Twenty-two participants were excluded prior to analyses:
15 participants who did not pass the survey's validity checks
(at both Time 1 and Time 2) were excluded and four partici-
pants wrote descriptions at Time 1 that included more than one
situation. The two participants for whom the random time
selection software malfunctioned and one who did not com-
plete the SAAP at Time 1 were also excluded from these anal-
yses. In line with the survey procedures at Time 1, participants
were given the option to not respond to any particular survey
item, thus sample sizes vary depending on the specific analysis.
The final sample for Time 2 (i.e., participants that had valid
data for both time points) comprised 79 males and 87 females.
The mean age was 38.47 years (SD ¼ 13.18). The ethnic
breakdown for the sample was 73% Caucasian, 8% African
American, 5% Hispanic/Latino/Latina, 10% Asian, and 4%
Other. Participants were compensated an additional US$0.75
for completing the second part of the study.
Measures
S8*. The S8* (Rauthmann & Sherman, In press) is an optimized
24-item measure of the psychological properties of situations
represented by the ``Situational Eight'' DIAMONDS (see
Rauthmann et al., 2014). Sample items include ``A job needs
to be done,'' ``It is possible to deceive someone,'' and ``Close
personal relationships are important or can develop.''
Brown et al. 5
Participants used a 7-point Likert-type scale to rate each item
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).
Behavior Checklist. To examine the predictive validity of the
SAAP, we generated a list of behaviors thought to be relevant
to each of the respective SAAP domains (see Table 2 for the
56 items). For example, self-protection behaviors included
items such as, ``I defended myself,'' ``I protected myself from
physical danger,'' and ``I felt concerned for my physical
safety.'' Participants indicated using a yes/no format whether
they did or did not engage in each of the 56 behaviors. The
items were presented in a random order.
Procedure
Time 1. As in Study 1, participants responded to the posting of a
HIT on the AMT website, which was only viewable to individ-
uals with an IP address in the United States. The procedures for
this study were similar to that of Study 2, with only two mod-
ifications. First, participants in this study indicated when they
went to bed and when they woke up on the prior day. Then,
specially designed software calculated the hours that the parti-
cipant was awake the prior day and randomly selected one time
interval. All times were in 15-min intervals (e.g., 9:15 a.m.,
9:30 a.m., and 9:45 a.m.). Participants were prompted to recall
their situation at this randomly selected time with modified
instructions, specifically, ``Please include: (1) where did it
take place? (2) who was with you? (3) what were you doing?
(4) what was happening? what took place?'' Participants were
provided with the same instructions regarding reporting only
one situation (see Study 2 Method). Participants rated their
situation using the 28-item SAAP identified in Study 1 and
confirmed in Study 2 in addition to the S8*.
Time 2. Participants were e-mailed approximately 1 week after
their participation in Time 1 and invited to participate in the
second part of the study. An average of 8.51 days (SD ¼ 1.03)
elapsed between Time 1 and Time 2 participation. After return-
ing to the survey website, participants were presented with the
same situation they wrote during Time 1 and again asked to rate
that same situation using the SAAP. It is essential that partici-
pants rated the same situation they rated the prior week so that
test­retest reliability could be examined. Participants also indi-
cated whether they engaged in any behaviors related to the
seven goals with the behavior checklist.
Results
Test­Retest Reliabilities
To address our first objective, evaluating the test­retest reli-
abilities of the SAAP, we first created composites of the
participants' Time 1 and Time 2 scale ratings, respectively.
The internal consistencies ranged from .78 (disease avoidance
at Time 1) to .97 (mate retention at Time 2). Next, we corre-
lated the Time 1 and Time 2 scale scores. The descriptive
statistics are presented in Table 3. The test­retest reliabilities
averaged .68 (range ¼ .55­.79, see the far right column of
Table 3). Overall, these test­retest reliabilities are quite good,
especially considering the brevity (4 items) of the measures.7
Convergent and Discriminant Validity
To address our second objective, evaluating the convergent and
discriminant validity of the SAAP, we compared its validities
to those from ratings of the S8*. To reiterate, the S8* is an
optimized measure of the ``Situation Eight'' DIAMONDS,
which is an empirically derived taxonomy of situations that
taps eight major psychological characteristics of situations
such as duty, mating, and sociality. Participants' composite
scores on the DIAMONDS were correlated with the SAAP
scores from Time 1. These correlations appear in Table 4.
Although the SAAP correlated modestly with many of the
DIAMONDS scales, there were, unsurprisingly, stronger asso-
ciations between scales that shared overlapping content (e.g.,
mate seeking of the SAAP and the mating dimension of DIA-
MONDS). However, it is of note that there were weaker asso-
ciations between kin care and all of the DIAMONDS factors.
This is ostensibly due to the fact that the DIAMONDS taxon-
omy of situations does not measure goals or psychological
characteristics of situations that involve taking care of one's
family.
Predictive and Incremental Validity
Finally, to address our objective of examining the predictive
validity of the SAAP over an existing measure of situations, we
first correlated participants' Time 2 SAAP scores with the
56 goal-related behaviors, see Table 2. In general, participants
engaged in behaviors that were consistent with their perception
of the goals operating within the situation. For example, parti-
cipants who scored high on the SAAP mate-seeking scale
tended to endorse items such as, ``I pursued a romantic
or sexual opportunity'' (r ¼ .48), ``I flirted with someone''
(r ¼ .52), and ``I felt attracted to someone'' (r ¼ .46).
Next, to demonstrate the incremental validity of the SAAP,
we conducted hierarchical linear regressions. In the first step,
we predicted each individual behavior checklist item from each
of the Time 2 DIAMONDS scores. We also made a note of the
overall model fit (R) for each regression. Next, as a mid-step,
we calculated semipartial correlations (see Table 5) to estimate
the degree to which the SAAP scales are uniquely related to the
behaviors after controlling for the DIAMONDS and the other
SAAP dimensions. Finally, as the second step in the hierarch-
ical regression, we added both the SAAP and the DIAMONDS
as predictors of each behavior. We retained the model fit
(R) for each of these models and calculated the change in
model fit (reported as R in Table 5). As evidenced by the
multiple-R changes in Table 5, the SAAP is still able to
predict the goal-relevant behaviors even controlling for the
DIAMONDS. This is particularly evident for SAAP
domains such as kin care, which is not well captured by the
DIAMONDS taxonomy.

Discussion
Study 3 demonstrated both test­retest stability, convergent, and
incremental validity of the SAAP. First, when two SAAP ratings
of the same situation were obtained across approximately a
week, scores were moderately stable. Second, while the SAAP
correlated with many of the DIAMONDS scales, one SAAP
domain--kin care--was only modestly associated. This is
unsurprising primarily because the DIAMONDS taxonomy is
derived from a situation taxonomy (the RSQ) that was not devel-
oped to measure these situation characteristics. Thus, although
the Situational Eight DIAMONDS (and its predecessor, the
RSQ) may serve as a proxy for some of the SAAP domains
(e.g., Morse et al., In press), it is evident that some content
coverage is lacking from a fundamental motives perspective.
Study 4: Convergent and Discriminant
Validity
Purpose
Study 3 provided initial evidence for convergent and incre-
mental validity of the SAAP. The purpose of Study 4 was to
provide further evidence of convergent and discriminant
validity of the SAAP using stimuli designed to prime the
seven fundamental motives. Prior research has used short
stories (approximately 600 words in length) specifically
designed to prime a fundamental motive of interest (e.g.,
Griskevicius et al., 2009; Griskevicius et al., 2010; Maner
et al., 2007). For example, Griskevicius and colleagues
(2009) primed mate seeking with a short story about encoun-
tering and spending time with an attractive member of the
opposite sex. Thus, when asked to rate a situation reflected
in the priming story, raters should be especially sensitive to
the items relevant to that fundamental domain. For example,
participants should rate the SAAP mate seeking items high,
and all other items low, for the mate seeking story from Gris-
kevicius and colleagues' (2009) experiment.
Procedure and Materials
Ten naive research assistants8 (6 males and 4 females), unac-
quainted with the purpose of the present study, were instructed
to read short stories designed to prime one of the seven funda-
mental motives, respectively.9 To reiterate, the short stories
rated employed here have been used in prior experimental
research (e.g., Griskevicius et al., 2009). The research assis-
tants then rated the short story using the 28-item SAAP using a
5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to
5 (strongly agree). This procedure was repeated for each of the
stories.
Results
To examine whether the SAAP is sensitive to these experimen-
tal primes, we aggregated the ratings across research assistants
(after first forming composites for each rater). Figure 1 visually
displays the means for each motive priming story. The standard
errors for these means were small, which indicates that the
means are quite stable.10

The plots demonstrate that the SAAP does an adequate job
of measuring the degree to which situations induce these fun-
damental motives. Indeed, the aggregate SAAP scores indicate
that raters consistently judged the stories as eliciting the primed
motive well over the midpoint of the scale. Similarly, these
ratings provide evidence of discriminant validity of the SAAP.
When raters rated a situation within one specific priming sti-
mulus, they did not rate other unrelated motives as being rel-
evant.11 For example, when kin care was primed, no other
motive was rated higher than 2.5. This is important because
it suggests that the SAAP factors can accurately assess each
respective fundamental motive.
Discussion
Study 4 provided evidence of convergent and discriminant
validity of the 28-item SAAP using stimuli designed to prime
the fundamental motives. Most importantly, this measure
appears to capture situational characteristics that might induce
the fundamental motives theorized by Kenrick and colleagues
(2003; Kenrick, Neuberg, Griskevicius, Becker, & Schaller,
2010). Because the SAAP is designed to measure evolutiona-
rily important goals of situations, it is essential to demonstrate
that the SAAP can capture the situation characteristics that
might make these motives salient and indeed they do. Study
4 also provides evidence for the discriminant validity of the
SAAP in that raters indicated low situational affordances for
motives that were not primed.
General Discussion
Human behavior is sensitive to moment-to-moment circum-
stances (i.e., situations). Decades of research have been
devoted to the task of identifying the essential psychological
characteristics of situations (e.g., Block & Block, 1981;
Edwards & Templeton, 2005; Funder, 2006; Rauthmann
et al., 2014; Sherman et al., 2010; Van Heck, 1984; Wagerman
& Funder, 2009; Yang et al., 2006). Despite recent efforts to
revive situation research (e.g., Reis, 2008), and the develop-
ment of new instruments for measuring the psychologically
important characteristics of situations (e.g., Rauthmann &
Sherman, In press; Sherman et al., 2010), more work needs
to be done in this arena to better identify the most basic features
of situations (Yang et al., 2009).
While a small, but growing, body of research has focused on
empirical routes for deriving the basic features of situations
(e.g., Edwards & Templeton, 2005; Van Heck, 1984; Yang
et al., 2006), little research on situations has been guided by
theory (cf. H. Kelley et al., 2003). Using evolutionary psychol-
ogy as a guide (Kenrick, 2011; Kenrick et al., 2003; Kenrick,
Neuberg, Griskevicius, Becker, & Schaller, 2010), the present
studies provide a substantial contribution to the literature on
situations by developing a theoretically guided measure of situa-
tions, the SAAP. This is a crucial endeavor for several reasons.
First, this research advances our knowledge of situations
from an evolutionary perspective. Using the Fundamental
Motives Framework, the SAAP offers a means of measuring
situational characteristics that facilitate or threaten adaptively
relevant social goals. The second is more pragmatic. When
someone is being physically attacked, nearly everyone would
agree--the law included--that it is reasonable to defend one-
self by any means necessary. What is unacceptable, however, is
aggression that results in the death of an innocent person when
no imminent threat existed. Are some people more prone to
perceive situations as necessitating more self-protection than
they actually warrant? Additional studies could investigate this
possibility by designing paradigms that require participants to
rate ambiguous situations using the SAAP. Thus, the SAAP
may be helpful in elucidating stable differences in construal
of situations (cf. Serfass & Sherman, 2013). The third reason
for development of the SAAP is that it allows us to test pre-
dictions derived from an evolutionary perspective in real-world
situations. Much of the research stemming from the fundamen-
tal motives framework has thus far been limited to laboratory
experiments. Understanding how actual situations experienced
in real life impact thought, behavior, and emotion requires
tools for assessing and quantifying the characteristics of such
situations. The SAAP allows one to measure day-to-day or
moment-to-moment changes in situations' perceived relevance
to adaptively relevant social problems.

Limitations
Some readers may be concerned that the means across the
subscales of the SAAP in the three studies were low. Indeed,
the scale means were often below 3 (i.e., the scale midpoint),
although, in most instances, the means for the subscales never
fell below 2 (with the exception of mate seeking in Studies 1
and 3). However, the low means do not, and did not in this
case, preclude (a) meaningful variance in the scales and (b)
associations with theoretically relevant behaviors. This is
most evidenced in Study 3, where all scales of the SAAP
showed strong associations with relevant outcomes. Further-
more, just because a kind of situation (e.g., self-protection) is
rare does not mean that it would not have a substantial impact
on an organism's fitness or require precise attunement and
coordination of the organism's response. Indeed, people
likely possess mechanisms for responding to particular adap-
tive problems that, while only deployed in rare circumstances,
are nonetheless consequential for fitness (e.g., encountering
dangerous conspecifics). These points notwithstanding, we
caution readers from interpreting the means for the scale
reported here as population norms for these scales and rec-
ommend that local norms be used until such population norms
may be established.
Readers may likewise be concerned that the correlations
among these subscales are moderately high. For example,
across the three studies, mate seeking and mate retention as
well as status and affiliation were strongly related to each other.
However, the fundamental motives framework (Kenrick et al.,
2003; Kenrick, Neuberg, Griskevicius, Becker, & Schaller,
2010) does not posit that these motives are orthogonal. More
importantly, when all of the SAAP scales were simultane-
ously allowed to predict outcomes (see Study 3), they still
provided predictive validity in a theoretically meaningful
fashion. Thus, although the scales of the SAAP are correlated
with each other, they are clearly not so highly correlated as to
be considered identical.
Because situations cannot rate themselves (Rauthmann,
Sherman, & Funder, In press), there may also be concern that
ratings of situations on the SAAP items assess an individuals'
personality as much as their perception of the situational char-
acteristics. Of course, self-reports of situations are colored by
an individual's unique perception, or construal, of the situation
(Rauthmann, Sherman, Nave, & Funder, In press; Serfass &
Sherman, 2013; Sherman, Nave, & Funder, 2013). However,
the empirical evidence to date indicates that people readily
agree about what situations are like and the amount of construal
in a single situation rating is quite small (Rauthmann, 2012;
Sherman et al., 2010).
We also note that, across these three studies, there were no
consistent gender differences in the means for each factor of
the SAAP. For example, based on traditional gender roles
regarding women caring for children, it might be expected
that women would be more likely than men to perceive that
their kin needing help. Indeed, we did find mean-level dif-
ferences in the experience of kin care for men and women,
but this difference was of moderate size and was not statis-
tically significant. The lack of consistent differences across
the seven factors might be due to a methodological limitation
(e.g., only 69 men vs. 119 women in Study 2). Alternatively,
as an anonymous reviewer noted, it is possible that men and
women share many of the same adaptive problems measured
at this level. Future research should continue to explore these
possibilities.
Finally, this initial sample was North American. It will be
important to extend this examination of adaptively relevant
situations to a more culturally and ecologically diverse sample.
Indeed, tools such as the SAAP may help us to understand the
extent to which people in different cultures encounter different
adaptively relevant social situations and to examine those eco-
logical factors that may account for differences between and
within populations in the prevalence and construal of these
situations. Nonetheless, the SAAP is designed to measure
affordances for adaptive problems facing all humans and, as
such, we suspect that non-North American populations should
have similar factor structures and properties. Finally, the sam-
ple for two of the studies (Studies 1 and 3) were recruited
online using AMT. Although the population of participants
on AMT is typically considered quite diverse in terms of demo-
graphic variables (e.g., age, gender, and ethnicity), there may
something unique about the kinds of situations experienced by
a ``worker'' on AMT. Thus, the results obtained here may not
generalize to participants recruited in an ``offline'' setting.
Based on prior studies comparing Internet and college samples,
we suspect that this is somewhat unlikely (see Gosling, Vazire,
Srivastava, & John, 2004).
Future Directions
The primary goals of the studies presented here were to con-
tribute to the development of the SAAP and validate its psy-
chometric properties. Future studies should integrate the SAAP
into novel research paradigms inside and outside the labora-
tory. As we have seen, evolutionary psychologists are already
priming these fundamental motives in lab experiments (e.g.,
Griskevicius et al., 2009; White et al., 2012). Researchers can
now employ a reliable and validated measure rather than rely-
ing on ad hoc manipulation checks to ensure successful
priming.
Extending beyond laboratory experiments, the SAAP pro-
vides a tool for measuring situationally influenced goal activa-
tion in vivo. For example, experience-sampling studies can
employ the SAAP to understand how momentary shifts in
situational affordances lead to changes in goal strivings (e.g.,
behavior). Further, such changes in behavior can then be linked
to changes in life outcomes at the level of single individuals
(e.g., how do situational opportunities or threats to goal
achievement relate to smoking behavior?) and organizations
(e.g., how do organizational dress code policies affect per-
ceived at-work affordances for mate seeking and what is their
impact on workplace productivity?).

Conclusion
Situations importantly influence the way people think, feel, and
behave. Yet only a small body of research attempts to quantify
the psychologically important features of situations. This arti-
cle contributes to this growing literature by providing an instru-
ment for assessing situational characteristics that may elicit
seven fundamentally important human motives. With such a
tool in hand, future research can focus on understanding how
situations influence human motivation and ultimately,
behavior.

Notes
1. In the original conceptualization of the fundamental motives,
affiliation was termed coalition formation.
2. Typically, Internet participants are excluded due to inattention or
reporting more than one situation.
3. Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) is an online platform that
allows requesters (e.g., companies and researchers) to post tasks
such as answering questionnaires (``HITs'') for workers to com-
plete in exchange for a small payment. The demographics of
AMT workers are typically more diverse in terms of age, gender,
and ethnicity than university samples. Prior studies have found,
however, that the data obtained via the Internet and in college
samples are quite equivalent (Gosling et al., 2004).
4. We also conducted an exploratory factor analysis to determine
whether the seven factors could be recovered from the 28-item
measure. The results of the exploratory factor analysis are
included in the Supplementary materials.
5. As noted previously, participants also described the psychological
characteristics of their situation with the Riverside Situational
Q-Sort, version 3.15 (Sherman et al., 2010; Wagerman & Funder,
2009). These results are available as Supplemental materials.
6. Two items distributed between the S8* and the Situational Affor-
dances for Adaptive Problems (SAAP) were designed to ``catch''
inattentive or careless responders. These items instruct partici-
pants to mark a specific scale point to ostensibly ensure that the
Brown et al. 13
survey is working properly. Participants had to respond correctly
to both of the items to be included in the analyses.
7. We also conducted a confirmatory factory analysis with full
information maximum likelihood estimation of the SAAP at
Time 1 and Time 2. For Time 1, the fit indices were w2(329) ¼
683.481, p < .001, root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA) ¼ .074 (90% confidence intervals [CIs]: [.066, .082]),
comparative fit index (CFI) ¼ .912, and Tucker­Lewis index
(TLI) ¼ .899. For Time 2, the fit indices were w2(329) ¼
665.159, p < .001, RMSEA ¼ .078 (90% CIs: [.070, .087]),
CFI ¼ .906, and TLI ¼ .892.
8. We selected 10 research assistants because we estimated that the
effect would be large, and we had 10 research assistants available
to perform the ratings. Similarly, we also expected that the mean
ratings from these 10 research assistants would be highly stable
because the scenarios were specifically written to elicit each of
the seven motives.
9. Two of the short stories have separate version depending on rater
gender (e.g., mate seeking and mate retention). Our research
assistants used the form appropriate for their gender.
10. A table of the means and standard errors for the research assistant
means are available as Supplementary materials.
11. The exception to this general statement is mate seeking and mate
retention. These motives appear to share some overlapping con-
tent, which is not surprising. Furthermore, the mate retention story
is written as a ``mate guarding'' scenario, which may account for
why the means are higher on mate seeking than its intended factor
(mate retention). That is, the items tapping mate retention (e.g.,
``In this situation . . . it is important to keep my romantic partner
happy'') are more difficult to endorse when one's imagined part-
ner is making them upset (e.g., actively kissing another person).
