Adoption of geodemographic and
ethno-cultural taxonomies for
analysing Big Data
Richard James Webber1, Tim Butler1 and Trevor Phillips2
Abstract
This paper is intended to contribute to the discussion of the differential level of adoption of Big Data among research
communities. Recognising the impracticality of conducting an audit across all forms and uses of Big Data, we have
restricted our enquiry to one very specific form of Big Data, namely general purpose taxonomies, of which Mosaic,
Acorn and Origins are examples, that rely on data from a variety of Big Data feeds. The intention of these taxonomies is
to enable the records of consumers and citizens held on Big Data datasets to be coded according to type of residential
neighbourhood or ethno-cultural heritage without any use of questionnaires. Based on our respective experience in the
academic social sciences, in government and in the design and marketing of these taxonomies, we identify the features of
these classifications which appear to render them attractive or problematic to different categories of potential user or
researcher depending on how the relationship is conceived. We conclude by identifying seven classifications of user or
potential user who, on account of their background, current position and future career expectations, tend to respond in
different ways to the opportunity to adopt these generic systems as aids for understanding social processes.

Introduction to and structure of
the paper
The purpose of this paper is to consider a currently
unexplored field, namely the reasons for the uneven
adoption of two new forms of generic classification,
derived from Big Data, which are commonly used as
general purpose, cross-industry and cross-application
standards when analysing social behaviour. Many
innovative methods have been developed by social sci-
entists to analyse Big Data. This paper does not how-
ever focus on methods. Rather, it examines the
adoption of geodemographic or postcode-based classi-
fications such as Acorn and Mosaic which classify
people on the basis of the demographics of the neigh-
bourhood in which they live and Origins, an ethno-
cultural classification, which infers cultural background
from a person's name.1
The relevance of these systems in a world of Big
Data is that they enable people of known identity to
be categorised by proxies for social status and ethnicity
quickly, inexpensively, without the need to develop a
bespoke classification system and without the need for
them to respond to a survey questionnaire.
In an introductory section we contextualise our dis-
cussion within the framework of the wider discussion
regarding the adoption of Big Data as an alternative
source of empirical evidence to that of the social survey.
We then explain the origins of generic taxonomies
whose standardised categories are derived from the
use of Big Data and discuss their potential complemen-
tarity with better established taxonomies whose

widespread use results from the ease with which they
can be included as questions in survey questionnaires. It
is important in this context to distinguish, on the one
hand, generic taxonomies, these being designed by one
group of researchers for use by an extensive population
of other third party users, from bespoke taxonomies,
these being designed by a user group primarily for use
in its own research projects or from research projects
whose purpose is aimed at improving quantitative
methods for optimising different forms of classifica-
tion.2 It is the use of the first category, generic taxo-
nomies, which is the exclusive subject of this paper. The
other categories are already well-documented and dis-
cussed in the academic literature.
To understand the uneven adoption of generic taxo-
nomies among the groups of potential user for whom
they have been designed we review some of the features
of these new taxonomies which, on the basis of our
experience, prove problematical for certain categories
of user and attractive to others. This leads us to a
consideration of the theoretical basis on which
they are constructed and the challenges these new
generic taxonomies present to existing theoretical
conceptualisations.
From this consideration of their features and rela-
tionship to theoretical constructs we believe we are in a
position at the conclusion of the paper to identify a
number of broad categories of user or potential user
and to characterise them according to how likely they
are to adopt these taxonomies.
Big Data as an alternative to the social
survey
First let us consider the wider context of the adoption
of Big Data in the social sciences. In their seminal paper
`The Coming Crisis of Empirical Sociology', Savage
and Burrows (2007) warn that the future effectiveness
of the social science community is in danger of being
prejudiced by over reliance on the social survey as a
tool for generating quantitative evidence.3 In their
opinion there are many fields of interest to the social
science community that could be more effectively inves-
tigated using large-scale data sets of the kind generated
as by-products of the digitalisation of transaction pro-
cessing systems (``Big Data'') which, generally speak-
ing, contain data on the whole population as opposed
to a sample drawn from it. The key advantage therefore
that most Big Data databases hold over traditional
respondent surveys files is that they contain informa-
tion on a larger number of cases, the information is
more up to date and is typically more granular. For
many researchers a further advantage of Big Data is
that it delivers information about revealed behaviour
rather than stated preferences.
It is argued that by failing to broaden their meth-
odological tool kit the practice of social scientists and
policy analysts stands apart from that of commercial
organizations. Almost all the largest commercial organ-
isations now accept the strictures of management con-
sultants such as Peppers and Rogers (2003) that a
critical source of competitive advantage lies in the
effectiveness with which a company uses transactional
information to understand customer needs. This, they
argue, can only be achieved through the creation of
large data repositories. The purpose of the Savage
and Burrows paper was to describe what, by compari-
son with the commercial sector, constitutes a compara-
tive failure to adapt to these new opportunities. The
paper did not set out to provide an explanation for
this failure.
Of course Big Data will never entirely replace the
findings of questionnaire-based surveys. The challenge
to the social sciences is to find an appropriate balance.
Though one can argue about what constitutes an
appropriate balance, in 2007, the year the Savage and
Burrows paper was published, there was little evidence
of social scientific researchers being among the van-
guard of Big Data users. The situation today has not
changed markedly. The high level of interest that the
paper generated has had only a moderate impact on the
usage of Big Data notwithstanding the exhortations of
funding bodies such as the Economic and Social
Research Council (ESRC) and the contents of follow
up papers such as Uprichard et al. (2009).
In our view, the explanation for the modest impact
of the paper on the culture of research practice is not
that the intended audience of social scientists did not
hear or did not understand its message. More likely
explanations lie in the inter-connection of cultural prac-
tices, institutions and assumptions which characterise
the organisational structures in which different cate-
gories of potential user operate. Institutional challenges
include the obstacles involved in gaining access to the
typically commercially sensitive, proprietary databases
controlled by privately owned companies for whom the
data is a valuable asset ­ witnessed by competition to
acquire the Tesco club card subsidiary Dunn Humby,
the challenges that fragmented research communities
can have in mobilising the resources to store and
manipulate databases of great size and complexity
and, as we explain later, the shorter time horizons
over which researchers' investment in new modes of
analysis need to be amortised given the length of time
for which the projects or research teams in which they
work are funded.
Cultural explanations (by which we mean the norms
of accepted academic practice) include the current pri-
vileging of explanation over description, assumptions
regarding the salience of causation, verifiability and
2 Big Data & Society
the importance of theory and concepts. These practices
are reflected, for example, in the statistical techniques
which students are taught and tend to rely on, the cri-
teria by which grant applications are evaluated and the
yardsticks by which the output of institutional research
is judged. A further and fundamental contrast with
`mainstream' social science involves the way in which
the latter often proceeds through the use of the `com-
parative method' (across for example time, space or
different cultures) and the analysis of social change.
In commercial applications relatively greater attention
is given to evidence and less to theory and what con-
ceptualised originate from the use of data are likely to
be treated as commercially sensitive. Crudely put, the
academic community relies on traditional methods as a
common currency by which the richness or otherwise of
its research endeavours can be evaluated on a peer
basis.
Contrary to the presumption of Thrift (2005) that
capitalism finds no difficulty in exploiting Big Data
for commercial advantage, an analogous debate can
be found in the journals of the commercial market
research industry (Mouncey, 2014). Here it is asserted
that mainstream market research companies, notwith-
standing their expertise in how to interpret the output
of social surveys and present its implications for cor-
porate strategy, have consistently failed to apply these
skills to the analysis of ``Big Data''. This emerging
market has therefore been left open to exploitation by
specialist data analytics businesses many of whose
founders' careers were built from expertise in statistics
and information technology rather than in social scien-
tific research.
When considering the potential evidence value of Big
Data as compared with traditional survey sources, it is
important to recognise a key dilemma faced by the
researcher. That is how to reconcile the competing
advantage of a rich source of behavioural evidence
with a comprehensive array of key demographic
classifications.
In comparison with sample surveys such as the
General Household Survey (GHS), Big Data datasets
tend to contain a proportionately greater wealth of
behavioural data but at the cost of much less rich
demographic content. This difference results not from
the intrinsic characteristic of Big Data datasets. It is not
necessarily that they are ``big'' or that they are differ-
ently structured from other forms of data, though they
often are, but that they involve the secondary use of
data collected intentionally or ostensibly for some other
purpose. The predominant sources of this by-product
data are transactional processing systems, often
updated remotely, digitally and in real time in which
there is no baseline data or anchoring in categories of
socio economic status (SES) such as occupation,
ethnicity and marital status. Such systems might be
ones that process customer orders, maintain the finan-
cial balances in customer accounts or enable digital
connectivity, for instance through delivering access to
websites, engaging with social media, enabling tele-
phone traffic or providing information on spatial loca-
tion. Increasingly the data is also collected intentionally
from applications whose primary use provides ``permis-
sion'' for its secondary use. Either way, they arguably
generate much richer sources of behavioural data than
survey questionnaires. However given that an organisa-
tion's customer/client insight team does not by defin-
ition have ultimate control over what information is
contained within a Big Data database, analysts are
restricted to accessing whatever data fields were speci-
fied as necessary for the efficient processing of the trans-
actional system. In most cases these fields do not
include measures of class, age, ethnicity or gender.
For the academic social scientist the absence of these
fields is likely to constitute a major obstacle since, as a
general rule, these classifications are the basis on which
much social scientific theory and hence explanation has
been developed. For analysts in commercial organisa-
tions this is much less problematic since the theoretical
concepts on the basis of which businesses make deci-
sions are to a much greater extent developed around the
relationship of one behaviour to another, not the rela-
tionship of behaviour to demographics. Whereas aca-
demic researchers may be more likely to use constructs
in the form of general rules, commercial researchers
tend to use constructs which are specific to individual
industrial sectors or even individual businesses.
Demographic details such as age and gender may of
course be collected via a parallel system such as the
application processing system for a loyalty card.
Where this is not the case social scientific research usu-
ally has an interest in finding a method of inferring
them from other data fields that are available or in
using proxies for them.
This is where the new generic taxonomies play a par-
ticularly useful role and why the increasing use of Big
Data has resulted in their growing use as alternatives to
traditional taxonomies. Measures of neighbourhood
type and cultural background can be appended to any
Big Data dataset that contains a customer/client name
and address. This can be done quickly, cheaply, retro-
spectively or in real time, unobtrusively and without the
distorting effects of high levels of non-response (Harris
et al., 2005; Sleight, 2004).
Taxonomies enabled by Big Data
Accepting that the proprietary nature of its content
constitutes a barrier that restricts access to Big Data
datasets by the wider research community, in this
Webber et al. 3
section of the paper we consider it useful4 to examine
the cultural and institutional constraints on the adop-
tion of Big Data within the more restricted frame of
new generic taxonomies derived from Big Data. In par-
ticular, we consider the origins, data sources and meth-
ods used to build these classifications, the commercial
organisations that deliver them and the role they play in
the analysis of Big Data sets. This particular segment of
the world of Big Data is referred to, but not explicitly
differentiated, by Savage and Burrows (2007). It is of
particular relevance to the wider discussion on the
adoption of Big Data since in this particular segment
neither cost nor proprietary ownership constitutes a
significant barrier to use. We define this segment as
the relatively new generic taxonomies such as the geo-
demographic classification systems Acorn and Mosaic
and the ethno-cultural classification system Origins.
Mosaic and Acorn are taxonomies which enable cus-
tomers/clients/citizens to be classified into some 60 or
so standard categories according to the type of residen-
tial neighbourhood in which they live. Origins is a
taxonomy which uses personal and family names to
infer a person's most likely ethno-cultural heritage.
This classification system uses a complex set of rules
which place individuals into the most appropriate one
of some 200 different categories.
Whilst very early versions of Acorn and Mosaic were
constructed solely using census statistics, the versions of
these taxonomies in current use have been constructed
using access to a variety of Big Data sources. Their
value to commercial and social research is that from
the name and postcode field on a Big Data dataset it
is possible to append both neighbourhood type and
inferred heritage. Using these taxonomies as the axes
in tabulations makes it possible to analyse behavioural
data on different datasets using a consistent basis for
comparison. A perceived benefit of these taxonomies to
the social sciences is that linked to Big Data they go
some way to bridging the `quantitative/qualitative' dis-
tinction by enabling access to a richness of interpret-
ative material that is often beyond the capability of
conventional statistical analysis. Few investigations of
social behaviour take place without reference to a tax-
onomy derived from one or more of the categories by
which social class, race, religion, age, gender, geog-
raphy and household composition are commonly rep-
resented.5 It is the analysis of behaviour against the
categories contained in these taxonomies that provides
the evidence against which theories can be tested and
developed. Inevitably there is a tendency for taxonomic
categories of this sort to become institutionalised in the
form of ``standard'' classification systems. Office of
National Statistics (ONS) standard socio-economic
classes and ethnic groupings are examples.
Consistency of categorisation makes it is possible to
compare cross-tabulations sourced from independently
collected behavioural databases.
Big Data poses a challenge to such taxonomies and
they to it. It is easy to overlook the fact that the prac-
tices by which people are categorised according to their
social class and ethnic origin were developed in an
environment where the survey was the principal
method of collecting behavioural information.6 To
practitioners familiar only with the use of social surveys
as a source of quantitative evidence it is not necessarily
apparent that such taxonomies are often not practical
or, if they can be obtained, not necessarily optimal in a
Big Data environment. Likewise the proxies for class
and ethnicity which it is possible to apply in a Big Data
environment are not necessarily characteristics which
users of survey questionnaires would find it easy to
adopt without an investment of time and concentra-
tion, both of which may be in short supply.
Taxonomies designed for use in survey research,
whilst designed to be predictive of differences in behav-
iour, have necessarily been designed in a form which
caters for the practicalities of the questionnaire as a
data gathering instrument. Respondents tick the box
which matches their age band and gender and, from
the occupation and the country of origin that they
write in, the survey administrator uses look-up tables
to translate occupations into social classes and coun-
tries of origin into standard ONS ethnic groupings.
Multi-variate taxonomies such as Mosaic, Acorn and
Origins work in a quite different way. Given that Big
Data repositories are rich on behavioural information
but light on conventional demographics, they are more
likely to employ complex grouping algorithms, based
on fuzzy logic and implemented using various forms of
cluster analysis. Customers / citizens are then organized
into ``natural'' classes on the basis of multiple attributes
crossing a number of different domains.
The sense in which these classes are ``natural''
(as opposed to ``purposive'') is that the categories are
deliberately not created in such a way as to reflect pre-
existing theoretical representations of social structure.
They are what most social scientists would therefore
characterise as `empiricist constructs'. It would be
odd if there were no correspondence between their nat-
ural clusters and the categories of traditional taxo-
nomies but ultimately such correspondence is
incidental rather than designed. Since most social sci-
entific theory is based on constructs of which con-
ventional taxonomies are designed to be the
representations, a frequent criticism of ``commercial''
sociology by academic social scientists is that it uses
concepts that are a-theoretical,7 that they have little
more than descriptive value and that they have little
to offer by way of causal explanation. To this consumer
marketing analysts reply that the new generic
4 Big Data & Society
taxonomies provide a more effective source of causal
explanation than single dimensional constructs that
are inherently difficult to link to behavioural informa-
tion and that the apparent lack of development of
causal theory in commercial organisations cannot be
presumed solely from the absence of papers authored
by commercial practitioners in academic journals.
Another key distinguishing attribute of taxonomies
arising from ``Big Data'' is that they are multi-variate
by contrast with most (though not all8) taxonomies
against which survey behaviour is tabulated. On
grounds of practicality these tend to be built from a
single criterion as respondents necessarily find it diffi-
cult to operate a complex rule set involving multiple
criteria.9
Where different fields of a questionnaire are com-
bined, as for example with indices of deprivation, the
derived taxonomy is typically created by summing
scores on data variables each of which acts as a surro-
gate for a more general and less easily defined syn-
drome, deprivation. This contrasts with the practice
of defining categories using permutations of values
from variables from different domains (such as families
with children without a car).10 Thus one would expect a
clustering of retail loyalty card-holders based on previ-
ous purchasing history to produce a set of natural clus-
ters which can be interpreted partly but not exclusively
in terms of age, income and family composition. One
would also expect the categories to be differentiated in
terms of take up of promotional offers, use of own-label
versus manufacturer brands and frequency of shop
visits. The manner in which these clusters are described
would align more closely with the language used
by qualitative researchers (or even political strat-
egists) than with the language of professional
demographers.
A common application of Big Data is to build
bespoke taxonomies which segment an organization's
own customers or clients on the basis of transactional
information. In this instance, it may be less important
for the categories to be comparable with widely used
classifications than would be the case in an academic
social scientific or public sector application; the organ-
ization concerned may place little value on the added
theoretical understanding of the sort that would be
obtained by aligning the individual classes with pro-
fessionally accepted standards. Nevertheless there are
contexts in which commercial organizations benefit
from using generic taxonomies recognised as standard
by the syndicated industry databases that they sub-
scribe to, such as the National Readership Survey
and the British Market Research Bureau's Target
Group Index.
The complementary relationship between user spe-
cific and generic industry-accepted taxonomies is nicely
illustrated by the behaviour of retail banks many of
whom place customers into the categories resulting
from the bespoke taxonomies they build using previous
customer behaviour. In such a taxonomy it is likely that
at least one cluster will be characterised by customers
who have tended to prove unresponsive to the promo-
tion of new financial products. When this bespoke tax-
onomy is further segmented on the basis of the
categories of a generic taxonomy the bank's insight
team is now likely to be able to distinguish between
those relatively inactive customers who tend not to
respond to promotion because they have little dispos-
able income from those who are unresponsive because
they undertake the majority of their financial transac-
tions with a competitor or a specialist adviser.
For all these reasons, it is unlikely that a generic
taxonomy such as Mosaic, Acorn or Origins will pre-
cisely replicate any of the measures on the basis of
which social scientific theory has been constructed
and it is not logical to evaluate their validity solely on
the basis of how accurately they replicate a traditionally
asked demographic construct. Their categories are
examples of different constructs, seldom as clearly
articulated as those developed in academia, and
are designed to be used in different contexts. These
constructs have been slower to find their place in aca-
demic social scientific than among media and political
classes.
Clearly there are contexts where it is too inappropri-
ate or too expensive to obtain from each customer the
information needed to place them in a formal tax-
onomy of the sort that is used in a survey questionnaire.
A charity would almost certainly experience a drop in
the value of its donations if it asked potential donors
for their annual income. A chain of betting shops
would receive short shrift from punters if they were
asked their religion or ethnic identity. In contexts
such as these it is more practical for an organization
to make use of one of the Big Data derived classifica-
tions that are marketed by information service pro-
viders as alternatives to class and ethnic origin.
Linking an externally built classification system to
one's own customer records is possible only if the two
have access to a common match key. In contexts where
goods have to be delivered or bills posted no-one
objects to providing a supplier with a record of their
name and address.11 As a result the various compo-
nents of a person's name and address are the fields on
customer files which are most often used as match keys
used for appending generic classifications.
The various elements of a person's name and address
provide a surprisingly rich range of material on the
basis of which inferences can be made. Many
women's marital status can be inferred from whether
they style themselves as Mrs, Miss or Ms. Gender can
Webber et al. 5
be predicted with a 90% or greater accuracy from
the personal name. Particular personal names, such as
Ivy and Wayne, are associated with particular gener-
ations and socio-economic backgrounds. Personal
and family names, such as Mohammed or Van Dijk,
often indicate ethnic origin, language, religion or
denomination.
The postcode field provides perhaps the most valu-
able source of information since, even in the era of
social media, the social influences to which people are
likely to be exposed are typically a function of the
demographics of the immediate neighbourhood in
which they and their families live. All these inferences
are examples of the potential value of by-product data
generated as a result of the operational requirement to
capture name and address for the purposes of delivery
and/or billing.
Names and postcodes are the two elements of the
name and address which most lend themselves to the
construction of serviceable taxonomies. Postcodes are
the units of geography now used by Experian, CACI
and other vendors of geodemographic classifications.12
These classifications make use of over 200 different
measurements, derived from official, administrative
and census sources, resulting in each postcode being
assigned to the most appropriate one of 60 or more
geodemographic categories. By analogy Origins is a
system which associates each record contained in an
organization's name and address file with one of 200
ethno-cultural backgrounds. A Big Data database con-
taining the personal and family names of 600 million
different adults was used to build this classification
system.
When used in combination with the software that
appends them to customer / citizen files, taxonomies
of this sort offer a variety of attractions. They provide
a very fast and inexpensive method of categorising very
large numbers of customer or citizen records. They are
non-intrusive. Their match rate of over 99% means that
the validity of results is not compromised by uneven
response rates.13 The categorisation is consistent, can
be updated on a regular basis and is independent of the
context or the operation of the classification process. It
permits consistent comparison between analyses of dif-
ferent datasets and at different times and, in respect of
ethnicity, a consistent set of categories irrespective of
the countries where the names have been collected.14
It is thought that postcode classifications are used by
the majority of UK15 organizations with databases con-
taining information on two million or more customer
address records. Because geodemographic classifica-
tions have been appended to respondent data for each
of the most widely used market research surveys
researchers can examine their predictive power across
many thousands of behaviours. On balance the level of
this discriminatory power is broadly similar to that of
standard measures of social grade. Qualitative field-
workers such as Butler and Robson (2003) have
reported a very close correspondence between their
own impressions of the character of communities
where they have conducted research and the portraits
used by geodemographic classifications to describe
postcodes within their study areas. Indeed given the
granularity of the postcode system, with over
1.4 million geographical pieces, and the 60 or so differ-
ent classifications that a taxonomy usually identifies, it
would be surprising if a natural taxonomy of neigh-
bourhoods based on the resources of Big Data could
not provide a much more fine grained and accurate
description of a neighbourhood than any metric based
on a single-dimensional domain.
To a large degree, this results from the freedom of
computer algorithms to create natural clusters which
are unconstrained by constructs derived from pre-exist-
ing theory and from the use of a single theoretical
dimension. The Mosaic label ``Liberal Opinion'' is a
good example. It was coined to describe neighbour-
hoods characterised by, among other things: large num-
bers of recent graduates, particularly in the humanities;
living in privately rented purpose-built or converted
flats; low levels car ownership; low child populations,
especially among school age cohorts; many children
born to mothers in their 30s.
No single demographic dimension would be capable
on its own of identifying this type of neighbourhood, or
what, in Bourdieu's terminology, can be described as a
``milieu''. It is our contention that academic social sci-
ence and commercial sociology can come together fruit-
fully when focusing on emergent social groupings such
as this. New generic classifications built from Big Data
should be able to provide greater nuance to terms such
as `new urban middle class' or even `gentrifier' as well
as locate them in space and enable their purchasing
preferences to be recorded.
That a category such as ``Liberal Opinion'' does have
inherent validity is evidenced by the results of the ana-
lyses of market research surveys to which Mosaic codes
have been appended. These identify diagnostic behav-
iours such as frequent foreign holidays especially to off-
beat locations, early adoption of new personal digital
technologies, extensive use of restaurants and coffee
shops, heavy readership of newspapers and on-line
media channels, frequent visits to cinemas, theatres
and exhibitions and support for environmental and
international charities. In the 2010 General Election
Conservative candidates achieved consistently lower
than average swings in constituencies with the highest
proportion of electors in this type of neighbourhood.
The downside of using such a taxonomy is that the clus-
ters are re-optimised at least every time the results of a
6 Big Data & Society
new census are published. This makes it particularly dif-
ficult to undertake temporal comparison.
The ability of a taxonomy based on multi-variate
criteria to create more meaningful categories than one
based on a single survey question is equally relevant to
the classification of people by ethno-cultural back-
ground. Clearly there needs to be some method of rec-
ording a person's heritage. But is that best obtained by
asking them their religion, their country of birth, their
ethnicity, their self-identification, the country where
their parents were born or when they entered the
UK? Each of these questions has appeared on a post
war British census but we contend that no single ques-
tion on its own provides an optimal basis for a general
purpose taxonomy which will maximise discrimination
when comparing the behaviours of members of minor-
ity communities.
Origins operates at a variety of levels of granularity.
At the coarse level the natural categories are interpreted
from the overlap of race (or colour), religion and geog-
raphy. The natural grouping ``Muslim'' includes Black
Africans with predominantly Muslim names. Detailed
categories such as Fijians and people of Indian descent
from Surinam would be placed in the same general
grouping as people with ``Hindu or Sikh'' names who
are geographically South Asian. East Asian is a group
primarily distinguished on the basis of geographical
location whilst ``White'' and ``Black'' are distinguished
primarily on the basis of appearance.
When the Origins classification was built the inten-
tion was not to create a taxonomy incorporating reli-
gion and language as well as race. However the
optimisation algorithm used to build the taxonomy cre-
ated a number of categories which could be effectively
interpreted only by using all three of these dimensions.
Features of new taxonomies that
influence potential users
In order to understand differences in the speed of adop-
tion of these new generic taxonomies it is important to
undertake a brief summary of some of their key fea-
tures which differentiate them from traditional classifi-
cations and which are relevant to potential users.
For some potential users these differences present no
hindrance to adoption. Indeed for some applications
and user categories these differences represent clear
advantages. For other potential user groups these fea-
tures may be off-putting.
When business planners in commercial organisations
such as Experian or CACI evaluate the market poten-
tial for a new segmentation system their evaluations
would typically take into account an inventory of
potential applications which are then assessed in
terms of potential impact and hence potential return
through sales. At this stage in the product cycle these
projections are likely to be based on an assessment of
potential benefits to different user groups, it being dif-
ficult to gauge the extent to which factors (including
those which we have broadly termed institutional and
cultural earlier in the paper) are likely to influence the
rate and level of adoption in different areas of
application.
In due course the deployment of the sales team is
adjusted on the basis of where it is easiest to win new
business. Any variance between the sectors of antici-
pated and actual usage is typically explained by the
management of the sales force in terms of the rational-
ity or irrationality of actors or even their levels of intel-
ligence and insight. Uneven adoption is not interpreted
in terms of the differences of perceptions and expect-
ations that result from differences in culture and organ-
isational structure.
In the following section we set out the key features of
these classifications which contribute to differential
rates of adoption among different potential user
groups. These features are discussed under seven head-
ings as follows.
a. Actionability
The characteristic commonly used to justify the
adoption of geodemographic classification in the com-
mercial sector is its ``actionability''. Whilst it was per-
fectly practical for a media buyer to select advertising
slots on commercial television channels on the basis of
whether the social class and age of a programme's audi-
ence matched that of a brand's users, social class and
age could not be used to target contact channels such as
direct mail, door to door distribution, tele-marketing or
customer mailings which, by their very nature, have
much greater potential for reaching finely-grained audi-
ence segments.
For these channels, taxonomies based on names and
addresses proved more ``actionable'' since these com-
munications channels could be targeted right down to
the person, household or street (postcode) level. The
use of such communication channels is not confined
to commercial organizations. Charities, political parties
(Webber, 2006) and a number of government organiza-
tions regularly use these channels to communicate with
citizens and Big Data based taxonomies have been
proved as popular with them as with the marketing
departments of commercial organizations.
Maximising the precision of targeting is a more
pressing objective for people involved in ``direct'' mar-
keting and the use of generic geodemographic taxo-
nomies for behavioural analysis tends to be restricted
to the identification of the market segments that gener-
ate most profitable response to communications.
Webber et al. 7
b. Perceived purposes
People who work in academic and not for profit
organizations can harbour feelings towards the taxo-
nomies of commercial organizations that range from
mild scepticism to ideological hostility ­ and of
course this is a two way street with commercial sociolo-
gists declaiming their academic colleagues as not living
in the same world. Common objections are that the
construction of these products is not methodologically
rigorous, that build processes are not transparent and
that the purposes for which they were designed are not
aligned with the requirements of social research. Many
of those who have been exposed to generic taxonomies
built from Big Data are unaware that the methods used
to build geodemographic and ethno-cultural taxo-
nomies originated within the public sphere.
The methodology currently used to build geodemo-
graphic classifications is largely based on that developed
during the Liverpool inner city deprivation study spon-
sored by the Department of the Environment, Planning
Research Applications Group (PRAG) (1975), the
objective of which was to differentiate neighbourhoods
on the basis of their different manifestations of depriv-
ation. Cummins et al. (1999) explain how tables that
infer ethnicity from names were first built by officers of
Bradford City Council with the aim of improving access
to public service by people of South Asian origin.
The concern that the methods are unacceptably lack-
ing in transparency undoubtedly results in part from
the difficulty academic social scientists have in accessing
the journals in which papers (such as Webber, 2000)
which describe the methods used to build them have
been published.
These are not factors which generally weigh heavily
on the minds of commercial users or the brokers
between academia, politics and the media but they are
powerful influences in some sections of the academy
although the primary sense of `unease' is the task, gen-
erally ignored by the developers, of interpreting the
``natural'' clusters arising from the classification pro-
cess within the pre-existing theoretical constructs famil-
iar to social scientists. A secondary concern is the
difficulty of undertaking time series comparisons
given that the taxonomies change every 10 years.
Some of these concerns are expanded on in the follow-
ing section.
c. Evaluation of methodology through independent
replication
It is often held that taxonomies based on Big Data
are not susceptible to independent replication. The abil-
ity to replicate findings based on free access to data sets
is a central tenet of research in the natural sciences
where it is arguably easier to control for external con-
ditions than it is in the social sciences. In the social
sciences it is reasonable to suppose that replicability is
more relevant where an objective of much research
work is to demonstrate causal connections or where
mathematical models are used to generate future
scenarios.
Where geodemographics are used for description,
replicability is less relevant. As a rule differences in the
methodologies used to build classifications have some
but very little impact on the extent to which different
classifications can predict variations in behaviour.16
The concern with verification cannot be considered
other than in the context of a belief in whether or not
there is a truthful representation which it is the object-
ive of research methods to try to replicate. If such a
belief is not held any solution is necessarily viewed as
the product of subjective assessment.
Commercial organizations, which are primarily con-
cerned with the ability of technology to deliver per-
formance objectives, tend to focus less energy on
methodological verification than on tests to determine
whether a new taxonomy will outperform those taxo-
nomies currently used to support key business pro-
cesses. Confronted with such a classification for the
first time commercial users like to enter their home
postcodes and check whether the geodemographic por-
trait matches their impression of their neighbourhood.
Researchers are more likely to want to ask questions
about methods and motivations although anecdotally
many academic researchers do precisely the same in
terms of entering their home postcodes and those of
close friends. For the commercial user the reputation
of the product and of its vendor are of paramount influ-
ence. The quality of documentation, support and ancil-
lary consultancy are also critical buying considerations.
d. Definition or description
An inherent problem with a taxonomy which is
based on multiple domains is how best to label its cate-
gories. This is particularly an issue for natural rather
than a bespoke classification. Tensions necessarily exist
between whether labels should aim for a precise defin-
ition or a memorable and insightful description.
A recurring complaint of some members of the aca-
demic research community is the subjective and impre-
cise character of the labels used. Quantitative
researchers, in particular, tend to dislike the way in
which Mosaic and Acorn labels limit themselves to 20
characters. This limitation is often assumed to follow
from a desire to satisfy the requirements of commercial
users. Such labels tend to resonate better with qualita-
tive or mixed mode researchers. By contrast commer-
cial users prefer to use labels such as ``Global
8 Big Data & Society
Connections'' which are descriptive, easy to understand
and to remember and not overly precise. Their use
comes more naturally to those who work in advertising
agencies and the media who are accustomed to the need
to distil the findings of focus groups into tag lines such
as ``Worcester Woman'' or ``White Van Territory''
which are understandable to their clients.
Whilst clearly it is possible to define categories in
formal classifications such as ``persons aged 45­64'' or
``South Asians'' in few characters, it is impossible to
create succinct definitions of complex multi-dimen-
sional categorisations. Indeed multi-dimensional classi-
fications by their very nature challenge the disposition
of those for whom exactitude of measurement may be a
more important consideration than deeper understand-
ing of a complex world.
For the commercial user an important consideration
is to be able to identify and attach labels to groups such
as ``Caring Professionals'' or ``Coronation Street'' which
are often subjectively felt to exist but which are other-
wise difficult to define and for which specific modes of
communication are believed to be appropriate.
For qualitative academic researchers the appeal of
the finer grained categories produced by a natural
grouping is that they may be able to sharpen the spatial
and theoretical definition of concepts already current in
social research. To them labels such as ``New Urban
Colonists'' or ``Summer Playgrounds'' are not just
target groups that can be reached on the ground but
physical conceptualisation of social processes which,
because they are difficult to represent in the form of a
survey questionnaire, are difficult to pin down in prac-
tice. They offer an opportunity to overcome a dilemma
which many academic social scientists struggle with,
that of integrating the social and the spatial.
A good example is the choice of the Mosaic label
``Alpha Territory'' for the name of an ESRC funded
research project which investigates the impact of
London's increasingly global population of supposedly
footloose, ultra-high net worth residents on patterns of
association among elite London neighbourhoods
(Burrows, 2013). It could legitimately be complained
that the term ``Alpha'' has no formal meaning is
social research. Nevertheless it is an example of a
term that is both economical and efficient in denoting
a group of very high achievers who are strongly ori-
ented towards delivery, whose culture is dismissive of
anything that is sub-standard in quality or performance
and whose language regularly borrows from the termin-
ology of global capital.
e. Multi-dimensionality
The persisting popularity of indices of deprivation
and of school league tables suggests the preference of
the UK political elite for one-dimensional ranking over
multi-dimensional classification. The predilection for
good­bad rankings is even more evident in the pages
of the British Sunday papers. In this context it is ironic
that the original justification for the development of
geodemographic classifications was to identify the dif-
ferent types of deprived neighbourhood for which dif-
ferent policy interventions would be appropriate. This
was intended to replace a policy under which all prior-
ity area funding was channelled to the same ``worst''
areas, irrespective of whether or not the programmes
were appropriate to their needs.17
As a general rule marketers, whether in the commer-
cial or public sector, are much more focused on seg-
mentation than academic social scientists, policy people
and journalists. The aim of marketers is to separate
customers into discrete groupings on the basis of differ-
ences in needs and motivations and then improve effi-
ciency by tailoring communications to the needs of each
market segment. This approach to customer relation-
ship management is reflected in the form of the metrics
organizations want to be able to access on their data-
bases and which they use to track the effectiveness of
their campaigns.
Whether or not this communication process is
undertaken by commercial or not for profit organiza-
tions is less important than people may suppose. One of
the earliest types of organization to adopt geodemo-
graphic classification were US and UK political parties.
Whilst many constituency MPs wax lyrical about
the contribution these systems can make to their
re-election, it seldom occurs to them that the very
same tools could be equally effective in improving the
targeting of public services communications to their
constituents.
f. Systematic bias
A key consideration of any taxonomy is whether its
classes contain any systematic bias in relation to behav-
ioural variables against which they may be analysed.
This is particularly relevant in two respects. Where
errors are random it is usually safe to use a taxonomy
for measuring and comparing distributions of a popu-
lation by classes of that taxonomy. It also suggests that
the use of classes within a taxonomy to model behav-
ioural outcomes is likely to be reasonably accurate. For
example, it is statistically accepted that different social
classes have different propensities to vote Conservative
or Labour in a UK general election. Let us suppose that
these different propensities were uniform throughout
towns and cities of the United Kingdom. In this case
we might reasonably suppose that it would be possible
to predict the Conservative and Labour shares of the
vote in each parliamentary constituency simply by
Webber et al. 9
multiplying the proportions of its electorate in each
social class by the national propensity of each social
class to vote Conservative or Labour.
It might surprise many to learn that on the basis of
this arithmetic the Conservative party would not have
won a single one of the 165 seats it won in the UK
general election of 1997. The reason is that in upper
class neighbourhoods, upper class electors are more
likely to vote Conservative than where they are in a
minority and vice versa. The social class of your neigh-
bours provides as good an ability to predict how you
will vote as does your own social class and one which is
more uniform in its predictive power in different types
of constituency. Likewise it has been shown by Webber
(1975) that although the level of unemployment in
Liverpool in the 1970s was far lower among workers
who were professionals or managers than among
unskilled workers, a professional or manager living in
a neighbourhood of inner city council flats was more
likely to be unemployed than an unskilled worker living
in a prosperous suburban neighbourhood.
These are just two examples of individual behaviour
being subject to neighbourhood effects, replicated in
countless other studies ­ in other words, the behaviour
of immediate neighbours affects the behaviour of the
individual. In these two cases it would appear either
that what we define as a ``Professional or Manager''
conceals multiple different sub-populations or other-
wise that professionals and managers behave in system-
atically different ways according to where they live.
There is systematic bias, in this case by type of
neighbourhood.
Logically it would be reasonable to suppose that
the categories created by a natural classification,
which is constructed using a wide array of different
input variables and where no single one dominates
the clustering algorithm, will be much less subject to
this sort of systematic bias than traditional classifica-
tions which are defined using the response to a single
survey question. This goes some way to explain one of
the attractions of neighbourhood classifications to
retail multiples who need a reliable method of estimat-
ing likely levels of demand for different products and
services in the catchment areas of locations where they
might open a new store. Since the propensity of dif-
ferent geodemographic types to consume different
products is readily available from syndicated survey
sources and since the distribution of Mosaic types
within particular catchment areas is also known, a
basic model which multiplies purchasing propensities
in each Mosaic type by the proportion of the catch-
ment area that they represent will provide an estima-
tion of local levels of product demand relatively free
from systematic error.
g. Self-identification
Comparing taxonomies arising from Big Data and
the formal classifications designed for use in survey
questionnaires throws up interesting tensions regarding
the role of self-identification and ascription in the cat-
egorisation process. A significant number of academic
commentators express mild concern at the practice of
assigning an ethno-cultural classification to subjects in
a database thereby denying them the opportunity (or
indeed right) to specify their own self-identity. This
raises a number of interesting questions. If it is right
for the individual to select the ethnic origin that he or
she identifies with, should not that right apply in the
case of social class? And should we define areas of mul-
tiple deprivation on the basis of asking people whether
they feel they or their near neighbours are deprived?
In contexts where either class or ethnicity is used as a
basis for analysing citizen attitudes and behaviours to
which identity is relevant, such as for example self-
worth or perceptions of the degree of racial discrimin-
ation within an organisation, this would be a powerful
argument. However this argument has less power when
one is considering behaviours which are more likely to
result from inherited characteristics, such as for exam-
ple the political party a person supports. In these cir-
cumstances a more effective predictor, if it could be
constructed, might be the ethno-cultural category to
which a person's parents belonged.
Personal experience has taught us that asking the
supermarket check-out operator or the waiter ``what
are you / where do you come from?'' seldom elicits a
favourable response. It is clearly impertinent. However
it is our experience that posing the question ``where
does your name come from?'' seldom elicits a negative
response. Their name, though seemingly a very
personal characteristic, is seen by most people to have
a sufficient independence from their identity that
its origins can be discussed without trespassing on per-
sonally sensitive territory. Indeed discussion of the
origins of the owner's name will often lead to discus-
sion of quite personal areas of their life history.
This distinction is relevant when considering the high
rate of non-response to ethnic questions by survey
respondents as well as to the acceptability of using
names as proxies.
A common response of people when asked whether
the portrait of the type of neighbourhood their post-
code falls matches their self-perception is that it pro-
vides only middling accuracy but, however, it is a very
accurate description of their neighbours. None of us
particularly like being put in a box notwithstanding
the interest we all have in finding out which box
others belong to.
10 Big Data & Society
Challenges to existing
conceptualisations
In previous sections we have described the features of
taxonomies derived from Big Data which can be
aligned or misaligned with the requirements and cul-
tures of different groups of potential users. In this sec-
tion we examine two other problematical characteristics
of new taxonomies based on Big Data, particularly
those which can prove difficult when incorporated
within the traditional conceptualisations which under-
pin social scientific theory.
(a) Timescales of inherited characteristics
When formal and Big Data derived taxonomies pro-
duce two apparently inconsistent classifications of the
same individual, many researchers understandably pre-
sume that any discrepancy must be due to error of some
kind. In practice these inconsistencies can often be
explained by the period of time over which the influence
of inheritance decays.
According to the results of the 2011 census few large
English cities have a smaller proportion of people who
declared themselves as Irish than Middlesbrough.
However Middlesbrough is close to top on the ranking
of English cities by proportion of inhabitants with Irish
surnames. The reason for this paradox is that family
names indicate distant heritage, in the case of
Middlesbrough a heritage some four or five generations
back, whereas self-identity, as recorded in the census, is
a more forward-looking definition, often corresponding
to the culture the respondent aspires to belong to or
with which she or he identifies.
The extent to which it is distant ascribed inheritance
or current self-identification that is more predictive of
behaviour will vary from behaviour to behaviour. An
example of distant heritage being more predictive of
attitudes than self-identification is the source of support
for an independent Scotland. Despite 10% of Scottish
residents bearing Irish Catholic surnames the pro-
portion who self-identify as Irish is just 1%. YouGov
survey results show the 10% of Scottish residents with
Irish Catholic surnames to be more supportive of
Scottish independence than people with Scottish sur-
names by 10 full percentage points (Demos, 2014).
This example nicely illustrates a number of issues
relevant to the conceptualisation of ethnic or religious
classification. First, as has been long known to US pol-
iticians, that historically distant heritage can continue
to have a very real impact on present behaviour. In
other words the influence of heritage on behaviour
can decay very slowly. The second is that the number
of respondents who self-identify with their distant heri-
tage may be far smaller than the number whose
behaviour is influenced by it, in the case of the Scots
Irish 10 times. Taking into account these two factors it
is evident that the group of people who claim a particu-
lar identity, in this case Scottish, can easily conceal very
important behavioural distinctions, in this case to sup-
port an Independent Scotland (Phillips, 2014).
Ethno-cultural background does not correspond
exactly with self-identity. The two represent different
components of ethnicity.
(b) The use of proxies
Given their entrenched use and institutional accept-
ance, it is understandable that what were originally
intended as indicative proxies can over time become
mistaken for the entities that they were originally sup-
posed to be indicative of. It is easy for analysts as well
as researchers to slide into the assumption that there is
a 1:1 correspondence between an ``indicator'' and the
characteristic which it was originally intended to
``indicate''.
Class, which is a multi-faceted and nebulous but
nevertheless a real characteristic (because we know it
discriminates on behaviour), eventually becomes con-
fused with the occupational classification which was
originally intended as a proxy for it. This explains
why class has fallen into so much disfavour in both
commercial and academic sociology ­ a rare achieve-
ment. Research originators as well as research users
slide into a reification where metrics are no longer sep-
arate indicators from the complex, multi-faceted con-
cepts for which they were intended to act as proxies.
In such an environment it becomes easy to suppose
that any discrepancy between a challenging taxonomy
and the incumbent proxy is misinterpreted as a source
of error ­ the incumbent has become the reality.
This slide is well illustrated by the use of an index of
multiple deprivation which, as its name implies, can do
no more than act as a proxy for whatever deprivations
local residents experience. Once deprivation becomes
unambiguously identified with its manifestations, local
councillors speak proudly about their wards being in
the 10% most deprived in the country when in reality
they are in the highest 10% of wards as measured by a
bundle of proxies for deprivation.
This confusion may seem immaterial until we find as
perspicacious authority of the condition of minority
communities as David Goodhart (2013) argue that a
disadvantage experienced by minority ethnic popula-
tions is that they are more likely than whites to live in
areas of deprivation when, in practice, this will continue
to be the case by definition so long as the size of the
minority population remains one of the indicators used
in calculating the index.
Webber et al. 11
A classification of potential users
In previous sections we have sought to explain differ-
ential adoption of new taxonomies on the basis of the
features that differentiate them whether positively or
negatively from traditional taxonomies. In this section
we believe that it is possible to identify seven broadly
different characterisations of user or potential user,
each differing in terms of their likely response to the
opportunity to make use of generic taxonomies of the
sort described in this paper.
Had it been our intention to undertake such
distinctions based on an academically rigorous and
verifiable methodology this would not be possible.
Instead we have the opportunity to draw on the experi-
ence of the lead author (Webber) who has worked
with geodemographic data for 40 years, devising,
promoting and consulting on the use of Acorn,
Mosaic and Origins by diverse potential user groups.
Our identification of these types also follows in part
from the consideration of some of the institutional
practices and cultural preferences described earlier in
this paper.18
(a) Corporate Information Managers
One important group of actors is commonly found
in large, consumer facing corporates such as banks,
utilities and retailers who sustain relationships with
their customers via some form of customer account.
These can be described as Corporate Information
Managers. This group also characterises the people
who manage the campaign databases used by political
parties. This group would typically style themselves as
information or insight specialists whose expertise lies
not so much in information processing as in informa-
tion management.
Much of the focus of the work of members of this
group involves testing strategies which can deliver
improvements in operational performance. Though
many will have graduated with a degree in a quantita-
tive discipline, few would identify themselves primarily
as social scientists. That is not to say that they do not
have a deep interest in citizen' / consumer behaviour. It
is just that this understanding, if it is conceptualised,
tends not to use the terminology commonly used
among members of the academic social science
community.
Though members of this group share a belief in a
common set of business precepts, conceptualisations of
customer motivation and behaviour are necessarily spe-
cific to the particular industrial sector within which they
operate. They aspire to and often succeed in developing
a holistic, multi-dimensional view of consumers which
enables them to communicate in a quite nuanced
manner using one-to-one communications channels
supported by sophisticated campaign management
software.
This group is typically early adopters of taxonomies
arising from Big Data on account of the size of the
databases that they manage, the ease of adding taxo-
nomies to them and their focus on actionability.
Though this group may need to apply for permission
to make major financial investments in new data they
are seldom required to explain to people outside their
immediate team the data and methodologies that they
use.
Their role is deeply embedded in the organization.
Stability of purpose enables people to adopt a long
term perspective.
(b) Strategic Marketing Advisers
Distinct from this group are Strategic Marketing
Advisors, many of whom work in advertising agencies,
brand consultancies and communications agencies.
This group of actors is highly focused on the use of
taxonomies of consumers, both to identify key audi-
ences for communications programmes and to match
the message to the audience. Traditionally this group
has ascribed a premium to qualitative description and
has focused more heavily than the previous group on
understanding attitudes, values and motivations rather
than just propensities to purchase specific products.
This group relies heavily on conventional taxonomies
such as class, age and education and is open to the use
of attitudinal or multi-dimensional categories, such as
the ``Worcester Woman'' and ``White Van Man'',
favoured by political strategists.
The particular interest that this group shows in taxo-
nomies arising from Big Data is the ability of the labels
to succinctly describe categories that they consider to be
relevant to their clients. This group does not confuse
proxies with reality. When using a taxonomy it is less
concerned than Corporate Information Managers
about discriminatory power or actionability than by
whether the taxonomy will be accepted among the
diverse sets of actors by whom they are paid. Does
the taxonomy have a good ``brand'' reputation and
are the categories instantly intelligible? Another
important characteristic of this group is that most of
the projects that its members work on have limited dur-
ation and their involvement with clients, being stra-
tegic, tends not to extend to the implementation of
taxonomies within operational systems.
By contrast comparison with the Corporate
Information Managers, this group is more likely to
value Big Data based taxonomies for defining the
broad segments for the purpose of brand positioning
and campaign strategy. They tend not to get involved in
the systems which drive one-to-one communications.
12 Big Data & Society
(c) Early Career Researchers
Within the academic research community we can
also identify a diverse set of actors most of whom are
little exposed to these forms of classification. For Early
Career Researchers, there is potentially a penalty for
using new taxonomies especially those that do not
have self-evident correspondence to the concepts used
in established theories and the metrics by which they
are represented.
Their thinking tends to be less bound by the iterative
process of testing and feedback that characterises com-
mercial consumer insight specialists and, perhaps due
to their lower levels of direct contact with the subjects
of their research, it is easier for them to confuse metrics
with the realities these metrics were originally intended
to be proxies for.
Funding through research grants is dependent on the
judgement usually of older and more experienced spe-
cialists many of whom have institutionalised interest in
the use of existing taxonomies, not least as a result of
their use in the research outputs that have contributed
to current theoretical knowledge.
Research outputs are constrained by the need to
communicate findings according to particular modes
of expression and influence is necessarily dependent
on the use of terms whose meaning is clearly under-
stood. Thus the adoption of alternative classifications
does constitute a significant investment and risk on the
part of the research practitioner. The risk is that they
may not have sufficient knowledge to defend their
research methodologies from the criticism of methodo-
logical experts, particularly where literature reviews are
likely to be thin and finding citations of acceptable
rigour will be hard. The upside is that their approach
can be seen by their more senior peers as `cutting edge'
and the associations with the private sector are increas-
ingly regarded as `brownie points' by senior managers.
Despite these drawbacks isolated individual
researchers have pioneered the use of these new taxo-
nomies in a variety of fields.19
(d) Researchers favouring quantitative methods
Within the academic community there are small but
important sub-groups. One of these, Quantitative
Methodologists, are actors whose principal interest is
not so much in the behavioural patterns that are the
traditional object of social scientific study but in
developing and critiquing statistical methods in their
own right. Whilst the conduct of this form of research
clearly has potential advantages in terms of methodo-
logical innovation, it is often said that with creating
effective taxonomies being as much an art as a science
competing methodologies are difficult to critically
evaluate in the absence of direct experience of the differ-
ent applications to which a taxonomy is likely to be put.
(e) Researchers favouring mixed mode approaches
Another important sub-group is Mixed Mode
Methodologists, often relatively experienced research-
ers, who combine an interest in quantitative methods
with highly specific and localised in-depth qualitative
interviews. Geodemographic taxonomies are received
particularly favourably by this group since they give
broader geographical context to the results of localised
research, provide evidence of whether particular find-
ings are part of a more widespread pattern and help
identify other communities where the processes that
they have identified are likely to be most apparent.
This group is often more comfortable generating
research outputs which are descriptive. The language
by which they conceptualise processes often conforms
less precisely to the language of established theory and
the categories by which it is otherwise represented. Such
researchers often have to be bilingual in terms of facing
two rather different constituencies at the same time.
(f) Opinion Shapers
The network of actors that mediates between the
academic community, the media, think tanks, political
advisers and civil servants, Opinion Shapers have a
more ambivalent attitude towards taxonomies arising
from Big Data. Whilst these actors derive their reputa-
tion from disseminating ideas which are new, their
influence is constrained by the fact that they are oper-
ating in a world where the recipients of their influence
are sorely pressed for time.
Given that their role is primarily to influence and not
to execute, a critical requirement of the ideas that they
promote is that they should be expressed in terms that
are already understood. Like successful advertising, the
messages this group propounds have to be conveyed in
the briefest of moments. This pressure contributes to an
environment where it is very difficult to operate other
than within conceptual frameworks and taxonomies
which are highly institutionalised. To be effective this
group has to focus on narrative rather than taxonom-
ical detail and on stories involving big absolute num-
bers rather than relative frequencies.
Heavy reliance on these institutionalised terminolo-
gies and the assumption that everyone understands
what is meant by them results in this group being
prone to equate proxies with realities and can result
in an institutional complacency where people are
unwilling to invest the time and effort on new ways of
seeing the world, however accurately these taxonomies
capture current social realities.
Webber et al. 13
(g) Civil Servants
Given the intense focus of Civil Servants on the pref-
erences and thought processes of their (supposed) pol-
itical masters, it is understandable why this group of
actors should be the least receptive of any group to the
new taxonomies arising from Big Data. Recruited
mostly from the humanities rather than from quantita-
tive disciplines, the culture of this group tends not to
prioritise direct experience or the analysis of evidence
from primary sources. The evaluation of the effect of
newly implemented policies is contracted out to aca-
demic researchers and consultants; service delivery is
outsourced to organizations that have no commercial
interest in the use of Big Data and encounters with the
subjects to whom public services are delivered is too
infrequent to sensitise this group to whether existing
taxonomies adequately capture the variety of the con-
temporary social world.
Among this group it is the policy agenda that drives
an increasingly tightly prescribed research requirements
agenda. One can picture the dinner table guests of Sir
Humphrey Appleby20 ­ or even Lord (Gus) O'Donnell
­ recounting anecdotes to illustrate personal idiosyn-
crasies or describing accidental encounters in the
social world (`according to my Colombian cleaning
lady . . .'), then sharing their experiences of focus
groups or imagining smart ways of using administrative
data to reduce the reporting burdens under which busi-
ness or the public sector suffer.
If members of this group did subscribe to the view of
Peters and Rogers that information management is a
principal source of competitive advantage, it is ques-
tionable whether they would apply it to the process of
developing public policy (partly because they do not
have competitors in what they regard as a monopoly
over policy). When celebrating the creative industries
and scientific innovation which they claim to be a hall-
mark of the modern British economy, it is doubtful
whether they would suppose that their own ways of
conceptualising the citizenry could benefit from innov-
ation of this sort.
Conclusion
This paper develops the general contention made by
Savage and Burrows that Big Data can provide insights
into social behaviour which are beyond the reach of
traditional survey questionnaires. It is our belief that
it is not helpful to criticise particular groups for not
making greater use of Big Data than they have.
Whilst we believe that it is not possible to provide a
theoretical explanation for the uneven adoption of Big
Data as a whole, we believe it is possible to identify the
reasons for differential adoption of the generic
taxonomies that have been developed principally from
Big Data sources. We contend that examining the dif-
ferential adoption of this particular form of Big Data is
useful since it is one where differences in adoption
rates cannot be explained either by the data being pro-
prietary and confidential in nature or by the cost of
accessing it.
On the contrary, we conclude that the uneven adop-
tion of these taxonomies is better explained by differ-
ences in the circumstances of potential user groups and
the relationship that exists between the objectives and
standards that guide research practice and the features
which differentiate new taxonomies from traditional
ones, some of which are off-putting to certain groups
but attractive to others.
We conclude that the adoption of generic taxonomies
based on Big Data is likely to be faster in environments
where it is possible to measure improvements in the
achievement of specific performance metrics. Adoption
is slower where the evaluation of research work rests on
its contribution to theories that are explicit and methods
are the common currency of the peer group that provides
the most important formal means of evaluation
(through status, promotions and appointments), that
have been established through a collaborative pro-
gramme of research involving multiple stakeholders
and in which the evaluation process is characterised by
extensive, external review. On the basis of our experience
generic taxonomies based on Big Data are more likely to
be adopted where external stakeholders are relatively
little involved in directing research activity and where,
as a result, a specialist analytic team is granted a rela-
tively high level of autonomy to implement ``whatever
works best'' in a results-driven environment. Acceptance
is likely to be greatest where there is long term continuity
in the management of the analytic team and where the
investment in understanding new taxonomies can confi-
dently be deployed over a longer period than a typical
research grant or ministerial appointment.
The conclusion that we have drawn from our ana-
lysis is that the adoption of taxonomies based on Big
Data is far from random, that actors' reactions are
much less capricious than we had supposed and that
it has proved much easier to develop theoretical explan-
ations for the uneven use of these systems than we had
originally expected.

Notes
1. The lead author has been involved in the development of
each classification.
2. Social Network analysis is just one example of a number
of effective classification methods to have been developed
in the social sciences from which it has proved difficult to
create a standard generic taxonomy appropriate for use
by multiple different users.
3. In the paper they bracket the social survey, which has to
some extent gone out of fashion, with the semi-structured
interview and make the point that both rely heavily on
inference to the whole population.
4. These taxonomies are considered ``generic'' in that, like
class and ethnicity, they support research applications
across a wide range of applications and across a variety
of different industries and they become used as a common
standard for comparing and/or integrating results from
different datasets by virtue of their consistent application.
5. It is probably worth noting that these concepts tend to be
nationally specific with, it might be said, the British being
particularly focused on issues of class whereas in North
America and much of Europe class does not have the
same resonance or meaning. In the US race/ethnicity
has long been much more central to sociological analysis
of difference.
6. These categories were updated in the 1990s using socio-
logical rather than medical categories in terms of the way
they treated `social' class and occupational and status
measures following the Goldthorpe and Lockwood
models combining them into the currently used
National Statistics Socio Economic Categories (NS
SeC) in place of the previously used Social Economic
Groups (SEG) and Registrar General measure of class.
This of course created the huge problem that the previous
classifications of occupational class were not compatible
with the new ones ­ David Rose produced some useful
look-up tables to enable a comparison between the two
classifications but the analysis of these was often the
source of controversy and threatened the historic trend
requirement that it was argued earlier was key to social
scientific method ­ see Butler et al. (2008) for an example
of this and the subsequent critique by Davidson and
Wyly (2012).
7. To this it can be countered that if the key objective of the
grouping algorithm is to produce natural groupings that
maximise discrimination on observed behaviour, it would
be surprising if there were not a high level of overlap
between natural and conventional taxonomies, which
for the most part there invariably is.
8. The 2011 census is a noteworthy exception to this
generalisation.
9. To a degree this is what is being requested when respond-
ents are asked to report their ethnic self-identity. But here
the rule sets that different respondents will use are neither
consistent nor explicit.
10. Though the census is getting better at that.
11. Though this is not necessarily the case with transactions
undertaken digitally which is why the new taxonomies are
not so often used to analyse web based transactions as
those using physical channels.
12. Unlike the government sector, which summarises statis-
tics by administrative divisions, the commercial sector has
a culture whereby statistical analysis is undertaken almost
exclusively using the postcode hierarchy.
13. More particularly in relation to Origins it avoids the
problems associated with differential non-response.
14. Nevertheless analysts in different countries may want to
aggregate detailed categories into different broader
groupings. Systems for inferring gender from name are
not country-independent, Andrea for example being a
boy's name in Italy but a girl's name in Britain.
15. These systems are also operational in 25 other countries
around the world.
16. This assertion is based on involvement of the authors in
the specification and testing of alternative methodologies
over four updates to the Mosaic build methodology.
17. This is a similar point to what Tudor Hart called the
`inverse care law' based on insights derived from being
a medical practitioner in the deprived mining areas of
South Wales from which he concluded that the deprived
areas needed more resources but invariably got less.
18. The evidence base on which this typology is constructed
derives to a significant degree from access to information,
such as the attendance lists of geodemographic confer-
ences and user groups, discussions with attendees, inven-
tories of licensed users, discussions with sales staff,
customer visits and responses to presentations to different
groups of potential user ­ some of which was shared in
confidence.
19. For example criminology, medical research, bacteriology,
bibliographics and tourism.
