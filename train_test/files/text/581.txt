Abstract
Background: Studies uncovering factors beyond socio-economic status (SES) that would explain racial and ethnic
disparities in mortality are scarce.
Methods: Using prospective cohort data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), we examined all-cause and cause-specific mortality disparities by race, mediation through key
factors and moderation by age (20­49 vs. 50+), sex and poverty status. Cox proportional hazards, discrete-time
hazards and competing risk regression models were conducted (N = 16,573 participants, n = 4207 deaths,
Median time = 170 months (1­217 months)).
Results: Age, sex and poverty income ratio-adjusted hazard rates were higher among Non-Hispanic Blacks
(NHBs) vs. Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Within the above-poverty young men stratum where this association
was the strongest, the socio-demographic-adjusted HR = 2.59, p < 0.001 was only partially attenuated by SES
and other factors (full model HR = 2.08, p = 0.003). Income, education, diet quality, allostatic load and self-rated
health, were among key mediators explaining NHB vs. NHW disparity in mortality. The Hispanic paradox was
observed consistently among women above poverty (young and old). NHBs had higher CVD-related mortality
risk compared to NHW which was explained by factors beyond SES. Those factors did not explain excess risk
among NHB for neoplasm-related death (fully adjusted HR = 1.41, 95 % CI: 1.02­2.75, p = 0.044). Moreover, those
factors explained the lower risk of neoplasm-related death among MA compared to NHW, while CVD-related
mortality risk became lower among MA compared to NHW upon multivariate adjustment.
Conclusions: In sum, racial/ethnic disparities in all-cause and cause-specific mortality (particularly cardiovascular and
neoplasms) were partly explained by socio-demographic, SES, health-related and dietary factors, and differentially by
age, sex and poverty strata.

Background
The past several decades have witnessed an overall re-
duction in mortality rates coupled with a sustained
Black-White mortality rate disparity with higher rates
observed in Blacks (e.g. 1950: 5310 per 100,000 resident
Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) population over 65y vs. 4865
per 100,000 resident Non-Hispanic White (NHW) popu-
lation over 65y; 2006: Rates were 3669 per 100,000 vs.
2456 per 100,000 in NHB vs. NHW, respectively) [1, 2].
Though narrowing down in recent years, [3] this dispar-
ity in mortality remains wide and was explained partly
by a long-standing socioeconomic racial stratification [4].
This comes in stark contrast to the Mexican-American
(MA) and Hispanic ethnic group disparities with NHWs
in mortality rates. In fact, assuming socioeconomic re-
sources are equalized, mortality rate among MAs was con-
sistently lower compared to NHWs a phenomenon known
as the Hispanic paradox [3, 5­10]. Thus, in the absence of
socio-economic equality, sizeable Black-White disparities
in mortality will persist, while MAs would live longer than

While socio-economic status (SES) was shown to moder-
ate as well as mediate racial disparities in adult mortality,
[11] only one study to date has systematically uncovered
the contribution of behavioral and health-related potential
mediators that go beyond SES [12].
We used national data to evaluate race/ethnicity ef-
fects on all-cause and cause-specific adult mortality,
while stratifying by age group, sex and poverty status
for all-cause mortality. We further evaluated the putative
mediating effects of SES, lifestyle, social support and
health-related factors in the association between race and
all-cause mortality risk and examined cause-of-death
structure across racial and ethnic groups.
Methods
Study population
The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) con-
ducted the NHANES III (Phase I: 1988­1991, Phase II:
1991­1994) by applying a complex multistage probability
sample design, providing national estimates of health and
nutritional status of the civilian non-institutionalized
population [13]. Using questionnaire, physical examin-
ation and laboratory data from NHANES III, we retained
adults age  20y (n = 18,825), who self-reported their race/
ethnicity as NHW, NHB or MA, thus excluding other eth-
nicities. This yielded a final sample of 18,110 participants,
of whom N = 16,573 were retained upon multiple imputa-
tions for descriptive statistics and N = 15,889 for survival
analyses, with a total of 4,207 deaths (2359 among NHW,
1090 among NHB and 758 among MA). NHANES III is
compliant with the ethical rules for human experimenta-
tion stated in the Declaration of Helsinki, including ap-
proval of an institutional review board and informed
written consent. The current study was approved by the
Office of Human Subjects Research Protections, National
Institutes of Health.
Mortality outcome
The NCHS conducted a mortality linkage for NHANES
III with the National Death Index (NDI), allowing inves-
tigation of baseline characteristics (1988­1994) in rela-
tion to mortality rates at follow-up through December
31, 2006. This public-use linked mortality file included
eligibility status, assigned vital status, mortality source,
person-months of follow-up from interview date and
from Mobile Examination Center (MEC)/home exam
date, and the underlying or multiple causes of death
[14]. We defined an event as death from any cause, start-
ing from the MEC examination date and ending on or
before December 31, 2006; or death from the following
underlying causes: "Major cardiovascular disease" (Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, 10th version, (ICD-10)
codes: I00-I78), "Neoplasms" (ICD-10 codes: C00-C97,
D50-D64), "Diabetes" as an underlying/contributing cause
(ICD-10 codes: E10-E14), "Other causes" (all other
ICD-10 codes) [14]. "Other causes" were sub-divided
into: "infections and respiratory (A..-B.. and J.. codes),
"gastrointestinal (GI), Kidney and urological" (K.. and
N.. codes), "Neurological disease" (G.. codes), uninten-
tional/intentional injuries (V..-Y..) and "others" (all other
codes). This detailed subdivision of causes (8 groups) was
used only in part of the analysis whereby the cause of
death structure (proportionate mortality) was compared
between the three major race/ethnicity groups. In the
main analysis of survival data, only deaths from major car-
diovascular disease and neoplasms were examined.
Main predictors
In the selected sample, race/ethnicity was coded as
NHW, NHB and MA. Two dummy variables were cre-
ated to contrast NHB and MA with NHW.
Exogenous variables
In the final models, exogenous variables were the variables
that were allowed to predict both potential mediators and
the final outcome. Those included continuous age (y),
sex, marital status (1 = Never married, 2 = Married, 3 =
Divorced, 4 = Widowed, 5 = Other), household size and
urban-rural residence (1 = Urban, 2 = Rural).
Potential mediators
Socio-economic status
Socio-economic status was measured alternatively by
continuous poverty income ratio, education (years) and
health insurance status (1 = yes, 0 = no).
Lifestyle and social support factors
Several factors were included in our models as mediators
that could be directly affected by socio-economic status.
Those include the latent constructs of "substance abuse",
"nutritional factors", "physical activity", "smoking" and
"social support". Substance abuse was operationalized
as "alcohol consumption (g/d)" and drug use (1 = Ever,
0 = never); "nutritional factors" as 1995-Healthy Eating
Index (1995-HEI) ranging from 0-100, [15] and the
mean adequacy ratio score (MAR), [16­18] (Additional
file 1); "Physical activity" as 3 related items: Item 1:
"Compare activity for past month to past yr (0 = less, 1 =
same, 2 = more), item 2: "Active compared with men/
women your age" (0 = less, 1 = same, 2 = more), item 3:
"Active now compared with self, 10 year ago" (0 = less, 1 =
same, 2 = more); "Smoking" with two items: Item 1: "num-
ber of cigarettes smoked per day" (0 among non-smokers);
item 2: "years smoked cigarettes" (0 among non-smokers);
social support with 5 items namely, (1) "In a typical week,
how many times do you talk on the telephone with family,
Beydoun et al. BMC Public Health (2016) 16:1113 Page 2 of 13
friends, or neighbors?", (2) "How often do you get together
with friends or relatives; I mean things like going out to-
gether or visiting in each other's homes? (per year)", (3)
"About how often do you visit with any of your other
neighbors, either in their homes or in your own? (per
year)", (4) "How often do you attend church or religious
services? (per year)", (5)"Altogether, how often do you at-
tend meetings of the clubs or organizations (per year)".
Health-related factors
The construct of "Health" was operationalized with self-
rated health, co-morbidity index and the allostatic load
(AL) score. Participants self-rated their health as: "Excel-
lent" (referent), "Very good", "Good", "Fair" or "Poor",
while the co-morbidity index consisted of total sum score
of 14 possible self-reported conditions, namely "arthritis",
"congestive heart failure", "stroke", "asthma", "chronic
bronchitis", "emphysema", "hay fever", "cataracts", "goiter",
"thyroid disease", "lupus", "gout", "skin cancer", "other
cancer". The allostatic load total score (0-9) is composed
of 9 items which are described in details in Additional file
1 [19].
Statistical analysis
Using Stata 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), [20]
analyses accounted for survey design complexity [14], by
incorporating sampling weights, primary sampling units
and strata. Multivariate imputed data [21, 22] was used
to estimate means and proportions across race/ethnic
groups, as well as various measures of associations in-
cluding odds ratios and linear regression coefficients,
after adjusting for sampling design complexity with sur-
vey (svy) commands. Comparison across race/ethnicity
groups were made using svy:reg and svy:mlogit com-
mands with race/ethnicity dummy variables as the only
predictors. Standard errors were estimated using Taylor
series linearization [14]. Comparison between race
groups (NHB vs. NHW and MA vs. NHW) in terms of
cause-of-death structure was done among all deaths in
the selected sample, comparing proportions of each
cause by use of a logistic regression model that took into
account design complexity and multiple imputations.
Defining time-to-event from any age  20y since base-
line visit (i.e. delayed entry) until death or censoring, we
conducted Cox proportional hazards models for all-
cause mortality stratifying by age group, sex and poverty
status as well as competing risk regression models for
cause-specific mortality. The time of follow-up is
expressed in months. A series of nested models account-
ing for sampling weights were carried out and using the
imputed data, in which socio-demographic, SES, lifestyle,
social support and health-related factors were entered
consecutively. The mediating effect of each of those fac-
tors was tested more thoroughly in a separate analysis
using discrete-time survival analysis within a structural
equations modeling (SEM) framework that accounted
for sampling weights, though using the original un-
imputed data. This was suggested as the optimal method
to examine causal mediation within the context of sur-
vival analysis [12]. In this generalized SEM model, the
final outcome was the hazard rate of death from all-
causes and the data structure is person-period rather
than participant-level data. The mortality outcome Y
(0 = alive, 1 = dead of any cause or specific cause) was
modeled using discrete-time survival with a logit link,
by adding 18 dummy variables for year of follow-up as
the main predictors for risk of death in the person-
period modified data. Race/ethnicity was the primary
exposure with two contrasts (NH black vs. NH whites;
MA vs. NH white). A series of generalized SEM models
were conducted, in which alternative mediators "M" were
included, one at a time. Those mediators could be
grouped under SES, substance abuse, diet, PA, smoking,
social support and health. The generalized SEM models
included covariates (age, sex, marital status, household
size and urban/rural area of residence) that were exogen-
ous to the system along with the race contrast variable.
Direct and indirect effects of race were estimated from
which the mediation proportion, a non-linear combination
of the two, was also estimated using the delta method. Of
particular interest were MP > 10 %, indicating an appre-
ciable proportion of a total effect mediated by "M" [23].
Type I error was set at 0.05 in all other analyses.
Result
Study sample characteristics by race/ethnicity group
Weighted proportions of NHW, NHB and MA were
~83 %, 12 % and 5 %, respectively. Compared to NHW,
NHB and MA participants were younger on average
(42y and 38y vs. 46y). NHB had lower proportion male
than NHW with the reverse being true for MA. Mean
PIR was lower among NHB and MA vs. NHW (2.02 and
1.77 vs. 3.28, p < 0.001); with a similar pattern observed
for poverty status and education(y). NHB and MA had a
higher likelihood of urban residence and a larger mean
household size compared to NHW, with marked racial/
ethnic difference in marital status. Lack of health insur-
ance was more common in MA (21.1 %) and NHB
(9.3 %) vs. NHW (6.1 %), with both NHBs and MA being
less likely to rate their health as "Excellent". Conversely,
both mean daily use and years of cigarette used were
higher in NHWs, who were nonetheless more physically
active than NHBs and MA, based on an item comparing
activity to age peers. Drug ever use was highest among
NHB (40.2 %), followed by NHW (37.0 %) and the low-
est prevalence was among MA (29.4 %). While alcohol
consumption did not differ between race groups, both
1995-HEI and MAR indicated poorer overall dietary

quality among NHB compared to NHW. With only one
exception (clubs and organizations), NHB had more so-
cial support from family, friends, neighbors and church,
compared to NHW; with the reverse being true for MA.
Self-reported co-morbidity was highest among NHW
and lowest in MA. In contrast, total AL score based on
objective measures of metabolic and inflammatory dis-
turbance markers was higher among NHB than NHW,
with no disparity detected between MA and NHW.
Examining individual components of the AL, NHB had
specifically a poorer profile in terms of albumin, CRP,
glycated hemoglobin, resting heart rate and blood pres-
sure levels compared to NHW (Table 1).
Cause of death structure by race/ethnicity
Out of 4207 deaths, around 60.2 % were caused by either
cardiovascular disease or a neoplasm, with another 9 %
having diabetes as the main contributing factor. Infec-
tious diseases accounted for 13.1 % of deaths, while
neurological, digestive/kidney and injuries accounted for
2­3 % of deaths each. The remaining causes, labelled as
"Other" accounted for ~9.6 % of deaths, overall. Compar-
ing NHW to NHB, NHB were more likely to have died
from digestive/kidney disease than NHW and less likely to
have died from neurological disease. When comparing
MA to NHW, diabetes, digestive/kidney disease, injuries
and "Other" were more common causes of deaths among
MA. The reverse was true for CVD and neurological
disease (Fig. 1).
Race/ethnicity and all-cause adult mortality: moderation
by sex, age group and poverty status
Smoothed all-cause hazard curves by race/ethnicity (ad-
justed for age, sex and poverty income ratio) were consist-
ently higher among NHBs compared to NHWs and
lowest in MA, with an average HR = 1.44, 95 % CI: 1.31­
1.58, p < 0.001, based on 5 imputations. No difference was
noted between MA and NHW in that model (Fig. 2).
Using Cox PH models (Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5), higher
all-cause mortality among NHBs vs. NHWs was specific
to younger men above poverty (Model 0, Table 2: Crude
Loge
(HR) = +0.87, 95 % CI: 0.50;1.24, p < 0.001), an asso-
ciation that remained significant after adjustment for
age, marital status, urban-rural area of residence and
household size (Model 1, Table 2). In Model 2 of
Table 3, adjusting further for SES factors (i.e. PIR,
education and insurance status), the race/ethnicity as-
sociations with all-cause mortality among younger men
above poverty was attenuated to Loge
(HR) = +0.71, 95 %
CI:+0.30;1.13, p = 0.001, with the fully adjusted model hav-
ing a similar effect of race on all-cause mortality in that
group (Table 5, model 8).
A lower all-cause mortality rate in MA compared with
NHW observed in several age group/sex/poverty strata
was retained in the full model only among women above
poverty (young and old), (Table 5, Model 8). In the
crude model (Model 0, Table 2), a lower risk of all-cause
mortality was found among MA compared to NHW,
specifically among men below poverty (both age groups)
as well as older women(both poverty status groups). Ad-
justment for age and socio-demographic factors attenu-
ated the effect appreciably in all these strata. Further
adjustment for SES factors, however, pronounced the
disparity among women above poverty (both young and
old), an effect that was attenuated upon adjustment for
dietary factors (Model 4, Table 3) as well as in subsequent
models. This effect was then markedly pronounced in the
final model, particularly among younger women above
poverty (Model 7, Table 4: -0.76, p = 0.07  Model 8,
Table 5: -1.17, p = 0.009). On the other hand, a higher
mortality risk among MA compared with NHW was
unveiled upon adjustment for age and other socio-
demographic factors, specifically among younger men
above poverty (Loge
(HR): Model 0, Table 2: +0.22, p =
0.37  Model 1, Table 2: +0.49, p < 0.001). This effect,
however, was completely explained away by SES factors
(Model 2, Table 3: +0.06, p = 0.84).
Race/ethnicity and all-cause mortality: individual mediators
in the total adult population
Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S2 show a series of gen-
eralized SEM models with the outcome being discrete-
time hazard of all-cause death, with the main exposure
being race/ethnicity, and individual mediators (M) being
entered alternatively to explain the total effect of race on
hazard rate. Among key findings, PIR, education, dietary
quality indices, AL and self-rated health, were all key
mediators in the pathway linking race to mortality when
comparing NHB to NHW (MP > 10 %). When contrast-
ing hazard rates between MA and NHW, the total effect
was not indicative of any racial disparities. Social sup-
port factors, drug and alcohol use, as well as insurance
status did not act as mediators.
Race/ethnicity and cause-specific mortality
Table 6 presents findings from competing risk regression
models. Age, sex and PIR-adjusted cardiovascular mortal-
ity risk was higher in NHBs when compared with NHWs
(Loge
(HR) = +0.22, 95 % CI: +0.07;+0.37, p = 0.005), an
association that was markedly attenuated in the full
model Loge
(HR) = +0.09, 95 % CI:-0.10;+0.28, p = 0.33).
In contrast, MA had a lower cardiovascular mortality
risk compared with NHWs, particularly in the fully ad-
justed model.
Moreover, NHBs had a greater neoplasm-related
mortality risk compared to NHWs in both the age, sex
and PIR-adjusted and the full model. A lower risk of
neoplasm-related death among MAs when compared

linear regression model with the variable being the outcome predicted by race/ethnicity and in which NHW was the referent category to which "NHB" and
"Mexican-American" were compared

Discussion
Using nationally representative data on US adults, we
examined all-cause and cause-specific mortality dispar-
ities by race/ethnicity, mediation through key factors
and moderation by age (20­49 vs. 50+), sex and poverty
status. Among key findings, age, sex and poverty income
ratio-adjusted hazard rates were higher among NHBs vs.
NHWs. Within the above-poverty young men stratum
where this association was the strongest, the socio-
demographic-adjusted HR = 2.59, p < 0.001 was only par-
tially attenuated by SES and other factors (full model
HR = 2.08, p = 0.003). Income, education, diet quality, allo-
static load and self-rated health, were among key mediators

explaining NHB vs. NHW disparity in mortality. The His-
panic paradox was observed consistently among women
above poverty (young and old). NHBs had higher CVD-
related mortality risk compared to NHW which was
explained by factors beyond SES. Those factors did not ex-
plain excess risk among NHBs for neoplasm-related death
(fully adjusted HR = 1.41, 95 % CI: 1.02­2.75, p = 0.044).
Moreover, those factors explained the lower risk of
neoplasm-related death among MAs compared to NHW,
while CVD-related mortality risk became lower among
MAs compared to NHWs upon multivariate adjustment.
Race disparities in all-cause and cause-specific mortality
rates, including death from cardiovascular disease and
cancer, among U.S. adults have been previously reported,
whereby Blacks or African Americans experienced
consistently higher mortality rates compared to Whites
[1, 24­26]. Several mediating and moderating factors
have been examined in an attempt to explain these race
disparities, including the moderating effects of gender,
[27] age [4, 28, 29] ­ described as "Black-White mortal-
ity crossover" ­ and obesity, [30] the mediating [24, 29,
31­33] or moderating effects [4, 11, 25, 34, 35] of social
factors, including poverty, culture and social injustice, [24]
socioeconomic position, [25] socioeconomic status, [32, 35]
social class, [36] education, [4] income, [4, 33, 34, 36]
perceived stress, [31] health behaviors [31, 32] and
health insurance [32]. Previous studies that examined
these mediating and moderating effects were based on

[1, 26] the National Health Interview Study, [28, 31, 36]
the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results program, [37] the Southern Community
Cohort Study, [30, 35] the Health and Retirement Study,
[32] the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, [33] the
Americans' Changing Lives Study [29].
A consistent finding from previous studies is that so-
cioeconomic factors can moderate the effect of race on
risk of death [4, 11, 25]. In addition, socio-economic sta-
tus and other factors can act in mediating racial dispar-
ities in all-cause mortality [31, 32]. In a recent study,
Krueger and colleagues used 1990 National Health Inter-
view data involving 38,891 US adults and found distinct
mediating effects of socioeconomic status, smoking status,
physical activity, perceived stress, sleep duration and alco-
hol consumption on the relationship between race and all-
cause mortality [31]. Similarly, analysis of the 1992­1998
Health and Retirement Study found distinct mediating ef-
fects of socioeconomic status, health behaviors and health
insurance as mediators of the race disparities in all-cause
mortality rates [32].
We find that NHBs had a higher rate of CVD mortal-
ity compared to NHWs, which is in accord with previ-
ous investigations [25, 33]. Our findings also suggest
that by factors beyond SES mediated this association.
Other variables may be important in explaining the
higher CVD mortality in NHBs. Jones-Webb et al. found
that neighborhood socioeconomic status moderated as-
sociations between race and CVD mortality among older

men; older NHBs living in impoverished neighborhoods
had a higher rate of CVD mortality, compared to older
NHWs living in similar conditions [25]. Unsurprisingly,
increased prevalence of CVD risk factors in NHBs may
explain the higher prevalence of CVD mortality in this
group [33].
Neoplasm-related death rates among NHB have
remained high or have increased over time in certain in-
stances [38]. Racial/Ethnic differences in neoplasm-related
mortality can result from a combination of factors includ-
ing smoking, nutrition, access to preventive, diagnostic,
therapeutic, screening services and aggressiveness of treat-
ment [38]. Modifying those factors could potentially pre-
vent over half of cancer deaths and eliminate most racial/
ethnic disparities [38]. Specifically, racial differences in
breast cancer survival prevailed even after controlling for
disease stage and known tumor characteristics, reflecting
the potential mediating effects of social determinants
beyond the biological, genetic and environmental factors,
including the barriers of poverty (e.g. lack of a primary
care physician, geographical access to care, competing sur-
vival priorities, burden of comorbidities, health insurance
status, lack of information and knowledge, risk-promoting
lifestyles and provider/system-level factors), culture (spir-
ituality, perceived susceptibility to breast cancer, cultural
beliefs and attitudes, and medical mistrust) and social in-
justice (racial prejudice and injustice) [24]. Menashe et al.
indicated that the rate of decline in breast cancer mortality
was slower among NH black women compared to White
women, while age-specific incidence rate in black women
was lower among blacks. Thus, the widening disparity in
breast cancer mortality could not be explained by a higher

incidence rate between 1990 and 2004 [37]. Thorpe et. al.
showed that there was about 70 % excess risk of cancer
mortality among Blacks compared to Whites, with socio-
economic status, health insurance, psychosocial factors,
behavioral factors and self-rated health accounting for
30 %, 18 %, 1 %, 17 % and 8 % of this excess risk [12]. Our
study indicated that there was a 41 % excess risk of neo-
plasm-related death among NHBs compared to NHWs,
which were not explained by SES, lifestyle or health-related
factors.
In terms of diabetes-related mortality, studies have
suggested that NHB have more than double the risk
compared to NHW [12]. Using national death files and
census data, for the 50 most populous US cities, that
age-adjusted rate ratios of mortality from diabetes were
higher in NHB compared to NHW in 39 of 41 cities,
ranging from 1.57 (95 % CI: 1.33­1.86) in Baltimore to
3.78 (95 % CI: 2.84­5.02) in Washington, DC. Poverty
alone explained 58.5 % of the NHB/NHW disparity in
diabetes-related mortality and segregation explained
72.6 % of the disparity. However, those mediating effects
of poverty and segregation varied widely across US cities
[39]. Between 1994 and 2001, the annual rate of newly
diagnosed elderly individuals with diabetes increased by
36.9 %, overall with Hispanics having the greatest
increase at 55 % [40]. Our study indicated that MA had
indeed a greater share of deaths attributed to diabetes
compared to NHWs.
The Hispanic paradox, a consistently observed
phenomenon, [9] occurs when mortality rates, specif-
ically cardiovascular [6] and smoking-related mortality
[5] among US Hispanics is similar or lower to NHWs'
rates, despite lower SES among Hispanics. Hunt et al.
reported the age and sex-adjusted HR for all-cause
mortality of US-born MAs vs. NHWs as 1.66 (95 % CI
1.15­2.40), while Mexico-born MAs vs. NHWs as 1.14
(95 % CI 0.63­2.06), [41] suggesting that "accultur-
ation" in young MA may be a multifactorial covariate
that is inadequately represented in large study sets
such as NHANES III, which is sampling for a "para-
doxically healthy" new immigrant population, rather
than a truly representative sample of young Mexicans
as a whole [42]. Generally, mortality rate differences
between MA and NHW are greater among older age
groups. Suggested mechanisms behind this paradox
include less acculturation to the US resulting in better
health, healthy migrant bias, and death records' misre-
porting of ethnicity or missing records upon return to
country of origin ("salmon bias") [43]. Previous studies
show that diet was healthier and smoking level was
lower among Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics,
which may partly explain their lower mortality rates
[7, 8]. These findings are not universal, with studies in
San Antonio [44, 45] and Corpus Christi [46] refuting
the apparent paradox. Our findings support the Hispanic
paradox mainly for cardiovascular mortality, which con-
curs with a recent meta-analysis [6]. It has been suggested
that increased fruit and legume consumption among this
group may have a protective effect [6]. Country of birth
may be an important consideration; data from the San
Antonio Heart Study show that diabetic MAs born in the
US have higher rates of CVD mortality, compared to
NHWs, while risk for CVD mortality was similar between
diabetic US-born MAs and NHWs [41]. The findings also
support the perplexing disassociation of several common
risk factors with cardiovascular disease mortality in US
Hispanic populations. MAs in our study had both lower
income and a lower mean education years, when com-
pared with NHWs. They also had a higher waist-hip-
ratio and glycated hemoglobin levels, as well as lower
access to health insurance. In contrast, MA were less
likely to smoke and had a comparable diet quality to
NHW. Smoking behavior differentials have accounted
for >50 % life expectancy variability between Hispanics
and non-Hispanics at age 50y [7]. Acculturation may
influence our findings as only 51 % of MA in our sample
were US-born.

Our study has several strengths. First, to our knowledge,
it among few nationally representative studies testing
associations between race/ethnicity and all-cause and
cause-specific mortality in the adult US population by
systematically examining effects within sex, age and
poverty status and investigating potential mediators for
all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Second, its large
sample size allowed testing associations with mortality
from homogeneous groups of causes. Competing risk,
selection bias, missing data, unequal probability of sam-
pling and design complexity were all addressed in our
analyses. Some limitations include residual confounding,
measurement error in covariates, particularly self-reported
potential mediators (e.g. co-morbid conditions), and mis-
classification error of underlying and contributing causes
of death.
Conclusion
In sum, racial/ethnic disparities in all-cause and cause-
specific mortality (particularly cardiovascular and neo-
plasms) were partly explained by socio-demographic,
SES, health-related and dietary factors, and differentially
by age, sex and poverty strata. More studies are needed to
uncover neighborhood-level and individual-level psycho-
social factors mediating the effect of racial disparities on
all-cause and cause-specific mortality among US adults.
