Meat-eating in India:
Whose food, whose
politics, and whose rights?

Abstract
Transitioning towards a plant-based diet is considered both ethical and environmentally friendly
from a Western perspective of high per capita consumption of flesh foods. However, in contem-
porary India, beef-eating has emerged as a political act of subversion in the context of its current
ban by the Indian state which is transforming unapologetically into a theocracy under the aegis of
Hindu fundamentalist groups. To understand the contemporary discourse on beef-eating, it is
important to locate it in the discourse prevalent during the Independence movement, when there
was an attempt to unify the Hindus to forge a nationalist identity, and to bring the `outcaste'
`untouchables' ­ who were a sub-group acknowledged to consume beef ­ within the Hindu fold
of `caste purity'. Data from an ethnographic study of over fifteen months in a village in the Indian
state of Tamil Nadu, demonstrate the place of flesh foods, including beef, in the everyday lives of
people, and question the concept of a `normative' Indian diet. The paper argues that contrary to
the notion that vegetarianism is morally superior, in the context of Hinduism, where vegetari-
anism is a marker of upper caste identity, the food hierarchy is a function of the caste structure.
Hence, the protests, particularly from the former `untouchable' caste groups, reclaiming the right
to eat transgressive foods as a marker of their identity, poses a serious challenge to upper caste
hegemony. The violence which `vegetarian' India has unleashed on such transgressions has laid
open the structural violence embodied in the caste system and questions its claim to moral
superiority.

Introduction
From a Western perspective of high per-capita consumption of flesh foods, transitioning to
a plant-based diet is upheld as a counter-cuisine of `political resistance to disciplinary power'
against food choices shaped by one's `upbringings, media, agribusiness, and government
funded nutritional science expert discourses' (Taylor, 2010: 73). While Taylor argues for
`ethical vegetarianism' from a position that a meat-based diet is `morally problematic',
with vegetarianism as a `proof of human superiority' (Taylor, 2010: 75), recent events in
contemporary India problematize both these notions.
In India, the term `non-vegetarian' is used to describe those consuming either egg, fish,
meat or any combination of these (Gulati and Verma, 2016), and though milk is from an
animal source, milk and its products are consumed by those who define themselves as
`vegetarians'.1 As Arunima remarks, `[t]he neologism "non-vegetarian", created by vegetar-
ian India itself speaks volumes, and makes the country possibly the only one in the world
where meat is not called by its name! Consequently, the normative status of vegetarianism is
reinforced by rendering meat nameless, and by reducing it to a depleted "non" of vegetables'
(Arunima, 2014: unpaged, para 2). This is indicative of the power wielded by vegetarians in
India who form a minority of the population.2 For instance, an authoritative study com-
pleted in 1993 by the Anthropological Survey of India found that 88% of the population
comprised `meat eaters' (Pathak, 1993).3 However, the category `non-vegetarian' is not a
homogenous entity because it is not accessibility and availability alone, but cultural factors ­
caste and religion being chief among them ­ that determine which flesh foods are consumed
by a particular social group. Among these, the taboo within the Hindu religion against the
consumption of cow's flesh which, in the 19th century, was used as a rallying point during
the nationalist mobilization in northern India (Sarkar and Sarkar, 2016), has now assumed
centre stage in contemporary debates.4
It was in 1949 at the time of Indian independence that a provision against slaughtering of
cows, calves, and other milch and draught cattle was written in the Directive Principles of
State Policy.5 Although its inclusion was very much linked to the upper caste Hindu reli-
gious sentiment with regards to the sanctity of the cow, the wording, bowing to modernity,
was couched in the language of science. Following this, as it was deemed to be a `state'
subject, the law on slaughter of cattle varied in the different states in India, ranging from a
total ban to slaughter of animals no longer considered useful. Currently, under the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rule at the centre, a party that subscribes to Hindu national-
ism (Harriss, 2016), a more comprehensive ban, broadened to cover bulls and bullocks, is
being operationalized in the states where the BJP is in power, and there is an increase in the
quantum of punishment for violating the law (Bahl and Purkayastha, 2015).6 Not only that,
even the possession of beef is considered a crime punishable by imprisonment by the police
force in Maharashtra ­ a state that has one of the most stringent laws against slaughter ­
who are provided with a meat detection DNA kit to test whether the meat is that of a cow or
not (Shaikh, 2017).7 Emboldened by the support provided by the BJP, the country is also
witnessing extra-legal actions carried out by the right-wing Hindu fundamentalist groups,
with increasing incidence of violence against those who are traditionally known to consume
beef. However, the emerging militant cow vigilantism has targeted one particular religious
community with a study showing that since 2010, 86% of those who were lynched by the
Hindu gau rakshaks (cow protectors) were Muslims, with 97% of these attacks taking place
after the year 2014 when the BJP came to power at the centre (Abraham and Rao, 2017).

Contrary to popular belief, beef-eating is prevalent amongst most religions including
Hinduism, and forms an important part of the regional cuisine, as in, for instance, the
states of Kerala and Meghalya. Hence, the slaughter ban which imposes the dietary norm
of a minority social group on all its citizens, varyingly termed as food fascism (Biswas, 2017)
or culinary apartheid (Masoodi, 2016), has triggered counter-movements in the country.8
At the forefront of these struggles are students' groups in universities, political parties, and
ordinary citizens (Avenshi Centre for Women's Studies, 2012; Ehsan, 2015; Express News
Service, 2015; Mathew, 2015).9 Their attempts to organize beef-eating festivals in public
spaces have been disrupted by vigilantes, police or are disallowed by the Court citing law
and order problems (Press Trust of India, 2012). Riding on the back of the beef ban,
are attempts to impose a strict vegetarian code by targeting abattoirs, ostensibly for not
complying with regulations, and closing meat shops during religious festivals (Chatterjee,
2017)10 and citing `sentiments' of people affected by the sight of meat (Press Trust of
India, 2017).11
This paper examines the politics of meat-eating, specifically beef-consumption in India.
To understand the contemporary discourse on beef-eating, it is important to locate it in the
discourse prevalent during the Independence movement, when there was an attempt to unify
the Hindus to forge a nationalist identity and to bring the `outcaste' `untouchables'12 ­ who
were a sub-group acknowledged to consume beef ­ within the Hindu fold of `caste purity'.
The paper begins by examining the creation of the popular image of India during the
colonial period (1858­1947), as a nation of vegetarians with a particular aversion to beef-
eating and the stands taken by the nationalist leaders, Gandhi (an upper caste Hindu veg-
etarian) and Ambedkar (from the beef-eating `untouchable' caste group), as they spoke to
the constituency of beef-eaters. Drawing upon an ethnographic study conducted over fifteen
months in a village in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the paper looks at the place of flesh
foods, including beef, in the everyday lives of people, and questions the concept of a nor-
mative `Indian diet' and how the politics of food plays out at the `peripheral' level.
This paper argues that contrary to the notion that vegetarianism is morally superior, in
the context of Hinduism, where vegetarianism is a marker of upper caste identity, the food
hierarchy is a function of the caste structure. Hence the protests, particularly from the
former `untouchable' caste groups, reclaiming their right to eat transgressive foods as a
marker of their identity, poses a serious challenge to upper caste hegemony. The violence
which `vegetarian' India has unleashed on such transgressions has laid open the structural
violence embodied in the caste system and questions its claim to moral superiority.
India, a vegetarian nation?
`Like many large tropical countries, India is characterised by a complex mosaic of distinct
agro-ecosystems, differentiated by its climatic, soil, geological, vegetational, and other nat-
ural features' (Kothari, 1994). The country's food culture reflects this diversity, differing
from region to region, having evolved over millennia, shaped by local availability and mode
of production. Though meat consumption was and continues to be very much part of this
multicultural cuisine, the popular notion that the pan-Indian diet is vegetarian could per-
haps be traced to the time of the colonial rule. The largely plant-based diet of the Indians
was a contrast to the British colonizers' flesh-based diet, a marker of their `exotic' status as
outsiders (Arnold, 1994: 3). However, it was in the 1860s, `driven by two areas of colonial
concern ­ famines and prisons', that the first systematic documentation of food
Sathyamala 3
consumption among this population was carried out (Arnold, 1994: 5). Hence, it was the
food culture of the deprived, one that was almost all cereal, that came to be seen as the
normative `Indian' diet and pronounced as inferior to the Western meat-based diet. It was
also pronounced as the source of subjugation of the Indian people (Nitti, 1896: 31).
McCarrison, an Army physician who had set up a nutrition research laboratory in south-
ern India in 1918, added to this notion by observing that the reason for the poor physique that
`characterized' the average Bengali or south Indian was due to their inadequate protein diets
containing little milk, milk products, and meat because `by religion. . . [they were] often a non-
meat-eater' (McCarrison as quoted in Walker, 2002: 107). In India, this piece of nutritional
thinking, that foods sourced from animals were essential components of a healthy diet, met
with serious opposition from Gandhi, a vocal proponent of vegetarianism who wrote
[m]edical opinion is mostly in favour of a mixed diet, although there is a growing school, which
is strongly of the opinion that anatomical and physiological evidence is in favour of man [sic]
being a vegetarian. His teeth, stomach, intestines, etc. seem to prove that nature has meant man
to be a vegetarian (Gandhi, 1948: 13, 14).
Gandhi had initially succumbed to the power of Western nutrition science and had sub-
scribed to the thinking that consumption of `[meat] would make [him] strong and that, if the
whole country took to meat eating the English could be overcome' and tried experimenting
with consuming goat meat for almost a year (Gandhi, 1949: 7). However, born in a vege-
tarian household he was unable to overcome his distaste and guilt in deceiving his parents,
from whom he had hidden his meat consumption. It was when he was in London, trying to
live up to a vow he made to his mother not to consume flesh foods under any circumstance,
that he found in Henry Salt's 1886 book, A Plea for Vegetarianism and Other Essays, the
moral basis as well a scientific rationale for his `hereditary behaviour' of vegetarianism.
While, according to Arnold (1994), Gandhi's rejection of flesh foods in his formulation of a
`swadeshi' diet was to be seen as a part of his wider struggle against Western dominance, for
Gandhi, it was a spiritual quest as well.13 Gandhi linked his vegetarian morality, based on
`scientific thinking' from a Western source, to the concept of ahimsa (non-violence) and
declared that the `only basis for having a vegetarian society and proclaiming a vegetarian
principle [was], and must be a moral one' (Gandhi, 1959 [1949]: 23, 26).14
However, his knowledge about the dietary behaviour of Indians appeared narrow. For
instance, while addressing the London Vegetarian Society in November 1931, he remarked
that he belonged to a country that was predominantly vegetarian by habit or necessity
(Gandhi, 1949 [1929]: 26). Though Gandhi was averse to all flesh-eating, his upper-caste
Hindu sensibility was particularly outraged at the consumption of beef, and it was the
'untouchable' caste groups which became the target for his reformist propaganda as they
were the ones who openly consumed the flesh of cow.15 It was left to Ambedkar, born of this
'untouchable' caste group, to show how it was that the food hierarchy among the Hindus,
specifically beef consumption, provided the material basis of the unjust caste system.
Food hierarchy and the caste system
Even a superficial view of the food taboos of the Hindus will show that there are two taboos
regarding food which serve as dividing lines. There is one taboo against meat-eating. It divides
4 Policy Futures in Education 0(0)
Hindus into vegetarians and flesh-eaters. There is another taboo which is against beef-eating. It
divides Hindus into those who eat cow's flesh and those who do not. From the point of view of
untouchability the first dividing line is of no importance. But the second is. For it completely
marks off the Touchables from the Untouchables. (Ambedkar, 1948: 318­319)
Thus wrote Ambedkar on the food pyramid of the Hindu caste system. He elaborated
further that there was yet another dividing line: those who ate freshly slaughtered cow
and those who ate the flesh of a `dead' cow; it was not that the untouchables ate cow's
flesh that made them `untouchable', because the people he termed `settled community', who
were part of the `touchables', also ate beef, but it was because the untouchables ate the flesh
of the dead cow. It was therefore the fact of consuming carrion which made the untouch-
ables polluted and polluting and it was their lives of abject poverty that forced them to eat.
Living on the doles of the upper caste and forced to perform the scavenging work ­ includ-
ing the removal of dead animals as their caste obligation and not having access to live cattle
whose fresh meat could be consumed ­ eating the flesh of the dead cow was one of the few
ways of adding to their meagre food basket. Gandhi, on the other hand, had a different take
on carrion-eating by the untouchable caste groups.
Cow preservation is an article of faith in Hinduism. No Harijan worth his salt will kill cattle for
food. But having become untouchable, he has learnt the evil habit of eating carrion. He will not
kill a cow but will eat with the greatest relish the flesh of the dead cow. It may be physiologically
harmless. But psychologically there is nothing, perhaps, so repulsive as carrion eating. And yet,
when a dead cow is brought to a Harijan tanner's house, it is a day of rejoicing for the whole
household. Children dance round the carcass, and as the animal is flayed, they take hold of
bones or pieces of flesh and throw them at one another . . . the whole family is drunk with joy at
the sight of the dead animal. I know how hard I have found it working among the Harijans to
wean them from the soul-destroying habit of eating carrion. (Gandhi, 1960 [1934]: 26; empha-
sis added)16,17
While Ambedkar locates the eating of dead cows as a reason for conferring his people the
untouchable status, Gandhi evades the issue of the origins of untouchability and locates
what he terms the `evil' and `soul-destroying habit' of eating carrion as a result of becoming
an untouchable failing to ask why they would be `drunk with joy' at the sight of a dead cow.
From a short story entitled `Cull' by Amitab, we have a grimmer description of what a dead
cow meant as food to a starving people:
[They] pounced upon the prey, raising a full-throated battle cry . . . young and old, all marched
forth, flashing their knives. Everyone had an eye on the thick thighs and buttocks. They pulled
and tugged at the carcass. Tens of knives were sawing at the chest at once. Whatever piece, small
or big, they could manage, they cut and put into their containers. The knives slashed and sliced,
chunks and chunks of meat were piled into the hampers and baskets . . . They were all covered in
blood . . . Their hair was red. Their limbs were red. The dirty rags they wore were red. From top
to toe they were all dyed in the same colour ­ red . . . The kites, vultures, and crows now sprang
into action. The dogs, alerted, attacked the skeleton. The crows hovered over the heads of the
people going home and swooped down on the troughs they carried on their heads . . . The men
and women, used to such attacks, held on to their baskets and troughs tightly with one hand and
with the other brandished their knives and twigs picked on the way to ward them off. (193­195)

(Short story entitled `Cull' by Amitab from Arjun Dangle (ed.) Poisoned Bread: Translations
from Modern Marathi Dalit Literature (Bombay, Orient Longman, 1992), as quoted in
Ramachandran, 2004: 32­33.)
In fact, Gandhi was so keen to find a scientific reason to buttress his arguments against
carrion-eating which did not necessarily involve the deliberate killing of cows against which
he could bring forth religious admonition, that he posed a series of questions to Dr
Deshmukh, the first president of the Indian Medical Association, on the physiological dis-
tinction between carrion and slaughtered meat, and was particularly concerned to find out
`any medical reason for the great repugnance that even meat eaters have against carrion'
(Gandhi, 1949: 44). While Deshmukh could not provide Gandhi with a physiological reason
against eating carrion even when poisoned, he provided him with a `psychological' reason
for aversion to eating non-slaughtered, dead cow despite admitting to `[c]ertain persons of
superior taste . . . decomposing meat before eating to pander to their epicurean taste'
(Gandhi, 1949: 45). Yet, Deshmukh said: `[i]t is a psychological fact, in the same way as
the flowing of water or rotation of the earth is a physical fact; as such use of carrion for food
in normal times is bound to create a feeling of loathing in the human mind, and feeling of
repugnance for the human being who practices this . . . Universal psychology is against it
and, therefore, it must go' (Letter from Deshmukh to Gandhi, cited in Gandhi, 1949: 47).
Ambedkar also urged his people to refrain from eating carrion, not from the point of
view of aversion, but as an affirmation of self-respect. On 20 March 1927, during the Mahad
Satyagraha he urged his people to `[root] out from our minds the ideas of highness and
lowness among ourselves. Make an unflinching resolve not to eat the thrown-out crumbs'
(Ambedkar, 2014 [1927]: 4). The Mahad Satyagraha also resolved to appeal to the caste
Hindus to bury their dead animals themselves. Gandhi (1973 [1933]: 65), on the other hand,
perceived the disposal of the carcasses as a sacred obligation of the untouchables, which they
should continue but, in order to achieve self-purification, should refrain from consuming
the flesh.
Though carrion-eating is no longer the norm, it continues to lie at the heart of the
contemporary politics on beef-eating: aversion of the upper-caste Hindus against the
beef-eating 'untouchables' versus the celebration of self-affirmation and identity as beef-
eaters by the former untouchable and other caste groups who have traditionally consumed
beef. The following section looks at the meat consumption pattern, including beef, in con-
temporary India.
The flesh-eaters in India
In 2014, a national-level survey showed that more than two-thirds of the respondents iden-
tified themselves as non-vegetarians, with the states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand,
Kerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal reporting more than 90% as non-vegetarians
(Government of India, 2014). A household consumption pattern showed that 29.2% of rural
and 37.6% of urban households reported consuming eggs, 26.5% rural and 21.0% urban
consumed fish/prawns, 21.7% rural and 27% urban consumed chicken, 6.4% rural and
10.0% urban consumed goat meat/mutton, and 4% rural and 5% urban consumed beef/
buffalo meat, in the 7 days prior to the survey (National Sample Survey Office, 2014: 26).
However, when per-capita consumption (in 30 days) was considered, with the exception of
fish (266 g in rural and 252 g in urban), and chicken (178 g rural and 239 g urban), the other
6 Policy Futures in Education 0(0)
flesh items were minimal; the per-capita consumption of eggs was only 1.94 ­ in rural and
3.18 ­ in urban, that of goat meat and mutton was 49 g in rural and 79 g urban, and that of
beef/buffalo meat was 42 g and 64 g respectively.
A noticeable regional difference was apparent, with the highest number of Hindus eating
beef/buffalo meat in Andhra Pradesh, followed by Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka.
Beef/buffalo meat-eating was most common in Lakshadweep (1.135 kg per-capita consump-
tion in 30 days), followed by rural Nagaland (576 g), and Meghalaya (419 g) (National
Sample Survey Office, 2014). Thus, the largest beef-consuming state was not the
Muslim majority state of Jammu and Kashmir but Meghalaya, where more than 80% of
the population consumed beef (Kishore and Anand, 2015). Though the number of
`Indians eating beef and buffalo meat went up from 7.51 crore18 in 1999­2000 to 8.35
crore in 2011­2012 the total household consumption of beef/buffalo meat went down
from 4.44 crore kg per month to 3.67 crore kg in the same time period' (Bansal, 2016).19
The analysis also showed that beef/buffalo meat consumption in the month preceding the
survey was highest among the Muslim population (42%) followed by Christians (26.5%)
(Bansal, 2016). Though Hindus were less than 2%, in absolute numbers they ranked second
with more than 12.5 million reporting beef-consumption (Kishore and Anand, 2015).
However, the consumption reported by the Hindus was considered an underestimate as
often they would consume it outside in eateries but not cook it at home.
These national-level data showing high prevalence of households and individuals
consuming meat, including beef, yet with per-capita consumption at a minimal level, are
corroborated at the micro level as well. In an ethnographic study carried out in a village
in Tamil Nadu, a state that was reported to have 90% of the respondents reporting as
`non-vegetarians' (Government of India, 2014), among the households from which
in-depth information was collected on their everyday diet, only two households reported
not consuming flesh foods (Sathyamala, 2016).20
The everyday diet consisted of the cereal rice eaten with a thin gravy of lentils and vegetables.
Milk, egg, chicken, mutton, beef, and pork were consumed varyingly. Cattle rearing was the
traditional occupation of the konar caste (`Touchable' caste) which was numerically and socially
dominant in the village. In the past, the cattle strength was many times greater than what it is
now and was meant primarily for producing dung for manure and for agricultural operations.
Milk was available in plenty and with no refrigeration or market, was processed into curd,
butter and ghee (clarified butter) and the village was said to be overflowing with these products.
The surplus milk went to the calves. What the market had done was to empty the village of milk
and with that had led to its disappearance from the diet of almost all the households. The
reduction in the population of the hardy Indian buffalo was the other casualty of the changing
demographic pattern. While in the past the village was said to be teaming with them, now only
one household reared them. Dwindling population of buffaloes has been noticed all over Tamil
Nadu. This is a loss, nutritionally speaking, because buffalo milk has a higher protein content
than cow milk.
Eggs were consumed not infrequently but the quantity was just sufficient to become a side dish
of `thodu-curry' (`touch-food'); two eggs would be bought and scrambled with onions and shared
among four or five family members. . . . Approximately half of the households (53%) in SC
[Scheduled Castes] and one-third (67%) of the other caste households reported that they rarely
ate eggs because of the cost. . . . Although chicken was not the preferred flesh food in the past, it
had come to replace other flesh foods because it was now cheaper and more readily available
Sathyamala 7
than the others. Yet, only 30% of the SC households and <6% of households in the other castes
reported once a week consumption; in all the other households it was occasional. Even in the
households that reported weekly consumption, the amount bought would be just sufficient to
provide each with a small piece, with the larger share going to the males in the family. Men
habituated to alcohol who had regular income were known to consume `non-vegetarian' food,
often beef, when they imbibed alcohol on a daily or weekly basis. Fish, both from the sea (the
coast was just 70 km away) and seasonally from the local tanks/ponds, were available at door-
steps, sold by traders on motorcycles. Sometimes fish was caught `illegally' from the streams
flowing near the village during the rainy seasons. However, its consumption was infrequent and
seasonal. Dried fish was available through the year and was eaten with great relish particularly
because of its high salt content and was either fried as a side dish or made into gravy
as kulambu. . .
Consumption of mutton, beef and pork were reported to have come down drastically from the
past and was now rare and confined to special occasions only, even among the not-so-poor.
This was particularly true for the Konar caste households where mutton was very much part of
their weekly diet in the past. The change was said to be due to the decrease in cattle strength, the
shift to more land-based livelihoods and the increasing cost of mutton. With the price of mutton
going up, the cost of beef and pork--foods consumed by the lower caste and the poor, which
were much cheaper--had also gone up and was increasingly moving out of the reach of the poor.
However, the consumption of beef and pork was also underreported because of the negative
association with its consumption, specifically linked to caste status. Yet, it was stated that those
previously eating mutton were shifting to beef whose price was going up because of the increas-
ing demand. The SC households in general had no taboos concerning eating beef but only the
Arunthathiyar caste [the lowermost of the `untouchable' caste hierarchy] openly stated that they
ate beef. Consumption of beef had declined greatly also because of difficulty in accessing it.
In the past it was sold quite openly in the village but was now available only in the weekly
market in a nearby town. Lately the communal angle, the banning of cow slaughter and sale of
beef, had added to its non-availability. Though I was informed that even `today', people in the
village from diverse castes ate pork, only one family from the SC community openly stated to
relishing it, but then too only the men said they ate it. Some also mentioned that pork was eaten
for its alleged medicinal properties, particularly as a cure for piles.
The annual temple festivals (linked to clan gods) were times when families feasted on flesh foods
following animal sacrifices and, depending on the particular deity, goats, chicken or pigs were
sacrificed and eaten. It was reported that till a decade or two ago, bulls were sacrificed to the clan
gods by the `touchable' caste groups and its meat consumed, but the practice had now stopped.
It was also said that in the past, men from the SC groups would go hunting to snare hare or
birds but now with the installation of wind turbines, the scrub land was cleared, disturbing the
habitat of these creatures. (Sathyamala, 2016: 288­289)
Thus, though almost the entire village of a mixed caste composition comprising the former
`untouchable' castes and the 'touchable' castes reported consuming all types of flesh foods,
including beef, albeit some of them clandestinely, its reported consumption had come down
drastically, both because of the association of beef with low caste status and due to its
increasing price and non-availability. Carrion-eating appeared to be a thing of the past
and in any case, it was only the Arunthathiyar caste group that traditionally removed the
carcasses, ate the meat and used the skin for making leather articles utilized primarily in
irrigation.21 Randeria (1989: 184) too, in her study on carrion-eating among the
8 Policy Futures in Education 0(0)
`untouchable' castes in North Gujarat in the 1980s, reported that carrion-eating was no
longer prevalent. Moreover, as Cole (2017) argues, scientific studies have shown that `no
hard and fast rule exists between fallen flesh and slaughtered meat'. In any case with refrig-
eration and processing, the distinction between carrion and fresh kill makes little sense.
Unlike the findings from Chigateri's (2008) work with Dalit women in Bangalore, where
beef-eating was a source of contestation, in my study village, the Scheduled Castes' house-
holds did not see this as an important source of their `untouchability' status or oppression.
This could be perhaps because flesh consumption was not perceived as a transgression as
almost all households consumed flesh foods and consumption of beef was not a taboo even
among those from the `touchable' castes.
Structural violence of Hindu vegetarianism
From both macro- and micro-level data, though the majority of the Indian population
identifies itself as `non-vegetarian', the reality is that the consumption of flesh foods, includ-
ing that from cattle, is so little as to be almost negligible, indicating that the everyday diet of
the poor who form the majority of the population continues to be primarily cereal-based.
However, it is not this group of the economically underprivileged who are protesting the
imposition of a certain food choice of a minority over the majority. Though the cow
vigilantes have targeted the Muslim population that consumes beef, and also trades in it,
again, the major protests have not risen from this group either. It is from within the Hindu
population that the more militant protests have risen and though the beef-eaters from the
`touchable' caste groups are very much part of it, the challenge posed by the Dalit groups
move beyond the `right to eat' to, as Satyanarayana puts it, recreating caste as `a new
identity of assertion and pride' (Satyanarayana, 2014: 52). In this new reimagining, the
project is not the annihilation of caste but to reconfigure it as a contemporary form of
power, as modern, and subjective (Satyanarayana, 2014: 52). Beef-eating then becomes a
marker of identity, an identity that needs to be celebrated against the centuries of aversion
and humiliation imposed on a particular people on account of their location in the unjust
hierarchy because of the accident of birth.
Contrary to Chigateri's argument that the `moral ethic of non-violence that forms such a
powerful symbolic tool of vegetarian caste communities' is subverted by the Dalit critique of
the politics of food (Chigateri, 2008: 24), I would argue that the upper-caste, Hindu brand of
vegetarianism is based on the notion of caste purity which is not necessarily linked to care of
animals or non-violence, even though it drew its original inspiration from Buddhism and
Jainism, both of which had non-violence as a central tenet.22 For instance, a study on Euro-
American and Indian vegetarians concluded that while the former were more concerned
than the omnivores about the consequences their daily food choices have on environment
and animal welfare, the universalistic values they endorsed were not given much importance
among the Indian vegetarians (Ruby et al., 2013: 340). The Indian vegetarians' motivation
was based on the belief that eating meat was polluting due to a `heightened concern for the
conservative ethics of Purity'. Thus, in the upper-caste Hindu context, to speak of vegetar-
ianism is then, as Pandian puts it, to `talk of caste by other means' as against talking of caste
`on its own terms' (Pandian, 2002: 1735). In modern India, to impose a code against meat-
eating in general and beef-eating in particular is to smuggle casteism through the backdoor.
Claiming beef-eating as a marker of self-identity by the `untouchable' groups then becomes
a political project to talk of caste on its own terms.

The violence with which a certain vegetarian code is being enforced in India and the violence
with which the counter-discourse has been met with, renders its claim of non-violence an empty
rhetoric, revealing the continued structural violence of the caste system despite claims of
modernity. As Smith puts it, `. . . every ethical discourse expresses and constructs a different
moral field, draws different boundaries around morality, writes or speaks of different cultural
contexts' and that one would need to speak of moralities rather than morality (Smith, 2001:
25). Hence, in India, as long as caste dictates social norms, including what one can or cannot
consume, vegetarianism as an enforcer of caste purity will need to give up its pretence of being
in a morally superior position of non-violence towards living beings.
Conclusion
This paper examines the politics of meat-eating, specifically beef consumption in contempo-
rary India. The violence which transgression of a certain food code has evoked, has laid bare
the continued need for the Hindu upper caste India to maintain its hegemony at all costs.
Though its wrath is directed against the `other' ­ the Muslim population ­ it is the former
`untouchable' caste groups that have posed a serious threat to upper caste supremacy by
laying claim to their identity in all matters including their food culture. In this context,
orchestrated beef consumption promoted as a counter-cuisine is to be viewed as a political
act of subversion and resistance to the disciplinary power of the state which is attempting to
transform unapologetically into a theocracy under the aegis of Hindu fundamentalist groups.

Notes
1. Some `vegetarians' consume unfertilized eggs.
2. Today, a `Hindu meal' has become synonymous with a vegetarian meal.
3. In addition to the usual `meat', the food culture included consumption of field rats, baby croc-
odiles, civets and jackals, to name a few.
4. For an excellent analysis of the historical aspects of the beef ban see Sarkar and Sarkar (2016).
5. Passed in 1949, Article 48 in the Directive Principles of State Policy states: `The State shall
endeavour to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and
shall in particular take steps for preserving and improving the breeds and prohibiting slaughter
of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle'.
6. But, as Sarkar and Sarkar (2016) point out, most of the cow protection legislations were passed by
the Congress party which the Bharatiya Janata Party strengthened and implemented under its rule
fulfilling its electoral promises.

7. In some states it can incur 10 years of imprisonment, higher than that for rape which is only 7
years (Mahendra, 2016). In 2017, Gujarat enacted a law making cow slaughter punishable with life
imprisonment (First Post Staff, 2017).
8. In Maharashtra, a one-day ban on slaughter and sale of meat (not only beef) during the Jain
festival of Paryushan Parva has existed since 1964 in the Congress ruled Brihanmumbai Municipal
Corporation and in 2015, during the Bharatiya Janata Party rule, was extended to eight days
(Shekar, 2015). This was to cater to the sentiments of the Jains who are only 1.25% of the
population in Maharashtra (see: http://www.census2011.co.in/data/religion/6-jainism.html).
9. For instance, after the police conducted a `raid' in the Kerala state guest house on the instigation
of a right-wing Hindu group which reported that the restaurant was serving beef, scores of people
lined up the next day to partake of the buffalo meat curry on its menu as a sign of defiance, and the
restaurant ended up serving 5 kg more than was the usual amount (Mathew, 2015). Some of those
who partook in the protest admitted to going against their doctor's advice warning them of the
health hazards of consuming red meat.
10. See Wire Staff (2017) for a map on the lynching in India in cow-related violence between 2015
and 2017.
11. Even the screening of a film by students in Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, Caste on the
Menu Card on the beef-eating practices in Mumbai, was prevented by the authorities, but the
students went ahead and screened it (Shankar and Sabhrawal, 2015).
12. Varna is a system of social stratification in the Hindu religion, with no counterparts in any other
religion. There are four varnas: Brahman (scholars and teachers); Kshatriya (rulers and warriors);
Vaisya (traders and merchants); and Sudra (artisans and labourers); there is also a fifth group, so
low socially as to be considered outside the varnas and deemed `untouchables' who were consid-
ered polluted and polluting and discriminated against in various forms. Post-independence, when
untouchability was abolished legally (through Article 17 of the Indian Constitution which came
into force on 26 January 1950), the `untouchables' were categorized as `Scheduled Castes'. Gandhi
named them as `Harijans' (people of God), which has been rejected by them. Dalit, meaning
oppressed, is a term that has been adopted by some, particularly from the North. While caste is
said to be a convenient form of division of labour, it is in fact a hereditary system of inequality
legitimized by the Hindu religious texts. However, in India, the caste system is so pervasive, that it
is found among other religious groups (Christians, Muslims and Sikhs) as well. Caste is a system of
social exclusion and continues to determine a person's socioeconomic location. The `purity' of
caste is maintained by strict endogamy.
13. Swadeshi (of one's country/nation) was the call of the Indian National Independence movement
boycotting British goods and urging towards home rule.
14. Ironically, though Gandhi started out by rejecting all animal foods, when his health deteriorated,
he was forced to include milk in his diet. He argued himself out of his earlier position of a vegan
diet by stating that since his oath against consuming milk was for cow and buffalo milk, he did not
perceive any violation in taking goat's milk, although he admitted that it was keeping to the letter
but not the spirit of the vow.
15. However, Gandhi did not advocate a ban on slaughter of cows as he felt it would `mean coercion
against those Indians who are not Hindus . . . It is not as if there were only Hindus in the
Indian Union. There are Muslims, Parsis, Christians and other religious groups here. The assump-
tion of Hindus that India now has become the land of the Hindus is erroneous' (Gandhi, 1983
[1947]: 424).
16. This scene is as described by a Harijan tanner who was then living at the Harijan Ashram after
having `forsaken' his original home in the village (Gandhi, 1960 [1934]: 26).
17. Gandhi was also not being very truthful when he stated that no untouchable (Harijan) would kill a
cow because he was well aware that cows were deliberately poisoned by them so that their carcass
would be available for food (Gandhi, 1949: 44).
18. 1 crore is equivalent to 10,000,000.

19. This was based on three rounds of the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (the most
recent being 2011­2012) of the National Sample Survey Office.
20. The study village had a mixed caste base comprising the former `untouchable' caste groups,
designated here as Scheduled Caste (SC) as per the Constitution and other caste groups. Data
were collected in 2011­2012 with the baseline covering 674 households; in-depth information was
collected from a sub-sample of 288 households (147 SC and 141 `other castes households').
Christians formed 12% of the total population and there was not a single Muslim family in the
village. All the Christians, with the exception of one household were from the SC category.
The village is in a drought-stricken area with a single rain-fed crop.
21. With the shift to mechanized irrigation using electricity or diesel, the market for such products has
disappeared.
22. Historians have contended that beef consumption was very much part of the Hindu
religion during the Vedic times and that it was to counter the rise of Buddhism and Jainism
that vegetarianism, particularly, the taboo against beef rose (Ambedkar, 1948; Kosambi, 1965;
Jha, 2009).
