Historical Background of North and
South Sudan
Sudan has continuously sustained civil wars among its demo-
graphic/religious/racial groups for over four decades since
its independence in 1956.
These wars mostly between the North (Muslim) and the
South (Christian/Animists) came to a temporary end due to a
referendum that lead to the secession of South Sudan from
Sudan in 2011, creating the newest country in the world
known as South Sudan (Sudan Tribune, BBC News,
02/2011). Many South Sudanese refugees dreamt of one day
returning back to what most termed as their motherland. In
this case, nothing was more important for the South Sudanese
refugees than transitioning from being refugees to citizens of
their new country:
As a citizen, I don't mind us having to crawl and take small steps
in our progress. Development is not a race and for it to be
sustainable it should be holistic. We're starting from scratch and
have a lot of ground to cover. (Duany, 2012, ¶ 4)
However, this dream was short lived. Before most could
even step foot in their "motherland," there emerged a major
obstacle to their return. In December 2013, the newest country
plunged into yet another conflict between the southerners
themselves. This conflict has been termed as civil war by some
international monitoring agencies ("The Descent Into Civil
War," 2013). Once again hope was lost.
Start of the Historic Journey of the Lost
Boys
In the late 1980s, more than 33,000 Boys were forced from
their homes due to outbreaks of violence in southern Sudan
(Messina & Messina, 2007, ¶ 2). The International Red Cross
that found them as they walked to Kenya named them the
"Lost Boys" (after the characters from the Peter Pan story
because they were unaccompanied by their parents when
they arrived). Further, they did not know whether their fami-
lies were alive or dead. The phrase "Lost Boys" was used to
identify those who did not know where their families were.
The international agencies took them to the Kakuma refugee
camps in Kenya where they were housed, fed, medically
treated, and modestly educated. By this time, they had
walked nearly 1,000 miles and approximately 10,000 Boys
of the original 33,000 arrived in Kenya (Messina & Messina,

Capital Matters: "Found" Social Capital of
the Sudanese Refugee Lost Boys Living in
Kansas City Area
Danvas Ogeto Mabeya1
Abstract
This article investigates accrual, role, and impact of social capital of the southern Sudanese formerly known as the Sudanese
refugee Lost Boys living in the greater Kansas City area. Since their resettlement in the United States in 2000, Sudan has seen
a dramatic transition in its long geo-political conflict since its independence in 1956 ending up in cessation of the south from
the north. This cessation has created the newest country in the world (South Sudan). Simultaneously, a group of refugee
Boys commonly known as the Lost Boys of Sudan has renounced being called so. Instead, they prefer being called "South
Sudanese." The study uses semi-structured interviews to assess the degree of social capital of each refugee participant
relative to types of "capital" valued in mainstream American society. An adjunct inquiry is finding what type of social capital
endured by each of these Boys played a key role in helping them cope/integrate into American mainstream society.

2007, ¶ 2). In the early 2000s, about 3,800 Boys were reset-
tled in the United States. Many of the Boys did not know
their birth date and were assigned an age (minors or legal
adults) by the U.S. government to facilitate their resettlement
process in the United States (Messina & Messina, 2007, ¶ 2).
The intention of randomly assigning them ages was to make
them eligible to receive benefits under government pro-
grams for unaccompanied minors in the United States
(Barry, 2000). The Homeland Security Act (P.L. 107-296)
was enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in
2002 that established a new status for refugee unaccompa-
nied children under the term "unaccompanied alien chil-
dren" (UAC). To qualify under this act, one had to be less
than 18 years, lack lawful immigration status, and by the
time of arrival in the United States one should be without
parents or guardians who would take care of that individual.
This seems to contradict the Refugee Act of 1980 as stipu-
lated in the Congressional Research Service (CRS) Report
for Congress that states, "(1) to provide a uniform procedure
for refugee admissions; and (2) to authorize federal
assistance to resettle refugees and promote their self-
sufficiency"(Bruno, 2006).
Consequences of Arbitrary Assigned
Age
The demographic age resettlement arrangements immedi-
ately raised unforeseen challenges. Whereas minors were
placed under foster families where they received social and
educational support, those resettled as legal adults had to
secure employment immediately to fend for themselves;
they were provided with apartments rent-free for 3 months
but had to start paying rent thereafter. Acquisition of
English language skills was primary to secure even a man-
ual job in the United States. Another challenge that emerged
was the lack of previous work experience as most had not
worked in Africa. School-aged children rarely work in
Africa as the vast majority depended on their parents as
providers. In contrast, U.S. children as young as 16 years
old are permitted to work. Orphaned and resettled in the
United States, they soon discovered that nothing was free.
This point was driven home when legal adults were
informed that as soon as they started working, they had to
repay the purchase price of the airplane tickets which
allowed them to leave Africa as well as certain medical
expenses (Bixler, 2005). Some Boys found it necessary to
work two or three jobs to pay their bills and tuition, and to
remit some money to family and friends back in Africa
(Mabeya, 2011, p. 116). Securing jobs in America, the Lost
Boys needed to accrue substantial valued social capital in
their new host country which they lacked from Africa:
being fluent in English language, working individually,
keeping time, being efficient, working hard and becoming
successful (Macionis, 2014, p. 57).
U.S. Refugee Policies and Utilization of
Social Capital by the Lost Boys
The Lost Boys who reside in the Kansas City area moved
there due to secondary migration reasons. Secondary migra-
tion refers to any circumstances that prompt immigrants to
move from one location within the United States to another.
According to the Office of Multicultural Affairs, it is very
common for immigrants to relocate to other states and cities
in search of better work, cheaper housing, safer neighbor-
hoods, or to be closer to friends or family. The Office of
Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is aware of secondary migra-
tion and has a clause that caters for this in Sec. 412. [8 U.S.C.
1522] (IV).
In their empirical research on why East African immi-
grants moved to live in Kansas City and Missouri, Janzen
et al. found socio-economic reasons as the most important
factors:
Life was more straight-forward in the Midwest than in big cities
of the East; educational and job opportunities were available
more advantageously; raising families was possible. (Janzen,
2006, ¶ 8)
An Ethiopian immigrant, Daniel Fikru, who migrated to
Kansas City, confirms the above assertion by saying,
Kansas City is not a crowded place. There's a lot of opportunity.
Housing, education is affordable. (Beardsley, 2005, ¶ 6)
A participant in my study affirmed the above by saying,
Alot of Lost Boys came from other states to Kansas City because
of educational and job opportunities. Another thing is that if you
have a Lost Boy who is your friend in another location, you can
call him to come and live with you. (Mabeya, 2011)
Indeed Berger confirms Janzen et al. by explaining that Peter
Nyarol Dut, one of the Lost Boys, left Houston, Texas, for
Kansas because he was frustrated with trying to make ends
meet and trying to get educated (Berger, 2004). More so,
he felt discriminated against. He found it difficult to adjust
to the urban environment in Houston. An article by Nancy
Beardsley of Voice of America asserted that new waves of
immigrants were transforming Kansas City and Missouri.
This included African Americans moving from the south-
ern United States to more northern states (Beardsley,
2005).
Demographics of the Lost Boys in the
Kansas City Area
More than 100 Sudanese refugee Lost Boys were living in
the Kansas City metropolitan area at the time of this study.
The exact number of Lost Boys at any given time is difficult
Mabeya 3
to verify because of constant undocumented migration that
occurs; therefore, the accounted number of refugees varies
between sources (Associated Press, March 29, 2007). When
they arrived in Kansas City, they were received by St. James
United Methodist Church and former Kansas City Mayor,
Emmanuel Cleaver, who assisted in settling the Lost Boys. In
other cases, early arrivals assisted later refugee arrivals (Gak,
2006). Gak, president of the Brothers' Organization for
Relief, says, in May 2000, nine Lost Boys arrived in Kansas
City and were soon followed by 25 others. Later, 25 more
Lost Boys arrived in Kansas City and by 2001 there was a
total of 59 Lost Boys living in the greater Kansas City area.
According to Gak, most of the Lost Boys who live in Kansas
City relocated from other U.S. states (Gak, 2006). One study
on East African immigrants living in the Kansas City area
found an estimate of 200 to 300 southern Sudanese of the
Dinka origin living in Olathe, Kansas itself (Myers, 2004).
They were partly assisted in their resettlement by religious
and charitable organizations.
From Table 1, it is clear that the Lost Boys were not
directly resettled in the Kansas City area in 2000. One politi-
cal reason is that Kansas had been demographically viewed
as White, mainstream Americana by the media for many
years (Janzen, 2006). Indeed in 2003, Barnett reported that
the then Kansas Senator, Sam Brownback (now governor),
had opposed the resettlement of Somali Bantu refugees from
Africa citing their huge populations and cultural differences
(Barnett, 2003, ¶ 1). He later supported a bill that allowed
resettlement of refugees fromAfrica to Kansas partly because
states have no control over refugee resettlement programs
according to the Refugee Protection Act of 2001. He has
since met with some Lost Boys (Mabeya, 2011).
The Research Question
This study narrows down on a prior dissertation study on
refugee Sudanese Lost Boys in the greater Kansas City Area,
and seeks to address the following ethnographic and demo-
graphic research question through investigation: What fac-
tors and developments shaped the Lost Boys' experiences in
America?
Social Capital Theory
Sociologists have argued that it is important for people to
acquire social capital, and that the acquisition of social capi-
tal can improve a person's material and social circumstances.
This assertion is supported by Coleman who argues that
social capital can determine what kinds of resources are
made available to individuals and/or group as it is defined by
its function (Coleman, 1988). Coleman also argues that inte-
gration of people into a new society is done on an individual
basis and not necessarily as a group because each individual
has different amounts of social capital. For instance, in his
study of migrants living in Europe, Castles found that some
had "integrated," some joined "multi-cultural" communities,
and some were marginalized and experienced cultural "seg-
regation" (Castles, 1993). In my primary investigations, like
Castles, I found the Lost Boys had a fairly wide range of
experiences during their more than 10 years stay in the
United States, providing evidence of their segmented assimi-
lation (Alba & Nee, 2003). Bol Biong Bol (executive direc-
tor of the Sudanese Community Association, a San
Diego-based organization that helps refugees assimilate in
America) supports my assertion by explaining,
The hard fact is that in the U.S., Social Darwinism is still the
operating principle. As time goes by, we will have some Lost
Boys who will be very successful, and we will have some people
who will remain on the lower economic level, and we will have
some people who will be frustrated. (Weddle, 2003, p. 11)
What constitutes social capital has generated varying
interpretations and definitions among scholars and is ever
expanding. For instance, Fukuyama says, "social capital can

be defined simply as a set of informal values or norms shared
among members of a group that permit cooperation among
them" (Fukuyama, 1999, p. 16). Putnam defines social capi-
tal as the "connections among individuals, or social networks
and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise
from them" (Putnam, 2000, p. 19). Bourdieu has it as "the
aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are
linked to possession of a durable network of more or less
institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and
recognition" (Bourdieu, 1983, p. 241-258). Coleman's defi-
nition is, "Any aspect of social structure that creates value
and facilitates the actions of the individuals within that social
structure" (Coleman, 1990/1994). Comparing the contribu-
tions to thinking about social capital of the above social capi-
tal proponents, what resonates from their statements still
leaves room for more inquiries. For example, all the above
thinkers treat social capital as a valued good thing. However,
much is not said about lack of the "valued" social capital.
Perhaps a more in-depth analysis and synthesis of social
capital is done by Woolcock (2003). After reviewing social
capital theory, Woolcock distinguished and summarized
social capital theory into three major categories: bonding,
bridging, and linking. In the following section, I will explain
each of them in detail and how they relate to the integration
process of the Lost Boys.
Bonding social capital can be said to be horizontal, mean-
ing it occurs among people who are homogeneous (the Lost
Boys consider themselves brothers though most were not
blood related). This is a "vital capital" that helps them in
times of difficulty. Bonding brings and ties people of similar
situations together (e.g., a family, an affinity group, ethnic
group, club, or church). Horizontal bonding creates networks
of individual or groups of refugees which enhance commu-
nity productivity and cohesion that can become positive
social capital asset. Putnam calls this productivity and cohe-
sion the "Super Glue" of society (Putnam, 2000). It is the
inward looking of social networks that mobilizes solidarity
among a group. In some cases, immigrants/refugees relocate
to areas where their own ethnic communities reside and thus
will share both economic and social assets. According to
Dustmann, immigrants are very rational when it comes to
choosing their place of residence in a new country. They
quickly become aware of favorable and unfavorable condi-
tions in their new environment that are associated with devi-
ancy and little social welfare (Dustmann, 1999, pp. 297-314).
Therefore, immigrants/refugees who are resettled in unfa-
vorable environments with limited social opportunities will
relocate after some time to places where they think they will
likely maximize their opportunities and more so be closer to
their families and friends. The Lost Boys who participated in
this study relocated from other cities/states because of avail-
ability of opportunities in the greater Kansas City area which
had initially attracted a small number of them. As time went
by, those who were already settled in the greater Kansas City
area spread word about a welcoming environment in Kansas
City area, availability of opportunities, and a an ever grow-
ing population of the Sudanese community. The new infor-
mation started to attract more and more Lost Boys. One
notable observation that I made was that those who relocated
to the Kansas City area first were legal adults. Legal adults
were free to emigrate from one city/state to another, whereas
the movement of the minors was constraint for a period of
time because they lived and were taken care of by foster
families. They had to attain a legal adult age of 18 years and
this is under the U.S. laws. This age-based resettlement had
consequences in accrual of social capital. From the findings
of my dissertation study of the refugee Lost Boys in the
greater Kansas City area, minors who started off with little
social capital had advantage over the legal adults in the long
run. Minors received not only social and educational support
from foster families, but as time went by, they created strong
social bonds with those foster families that lead some foster
families treat them as adopted children, thus enjoying the
comfort of a real family. Those that were resettled as legal
adults largely had to fend for themselves; they were provided
with apartments rent-free for 3 months and banded together
to minimize expenses and to provide stability in their new
environment. More so they endured unique hardships, like
caring for younger Boys during their exodus and in the refu-
gee camps in Kenya. Trying to find employment immedi-
ately after resettlement without the benefit and care of foster
families, acquiring English in a new country was a great
challenge especially to those who had no working skills from
Africa. Besides all these, the elder Boys felt obligated to
remind the younger Boys of Sudanese culture, values, and
ways of life, once again fulfilling a sort of parenting role that
was critical for the development of normative behavior,
though younger Boys differ in their receptivity to retaining
Sudanese culture.
As opposed to bonding social capital that is horizontal,
bridging social capital is vertical, where social networks
occur between socially heterogeneous groups (Dolfsma &
Dannreuther, 2003; Narayan, 2002; Narayan & Pritchett,
1999). Bridging social capital is outward-looking and pro-
vides for a better linkage to friends and relationships from
other ethnic/racial groups in society. For Putnam, it is the
strength between the segments of society or what he calls
"Sociological WD-40" (Putnam, 2000). The agencies respon-
sible for resettling the Lost Boys believed that dispersing the
Boys would allow faster integration into American society
(see Table 1). This is in accordance with the Refugee Act of
1980, INA: ACT 411 FN 1 Sec. 412. [8 U.S.C. 1522] (2)(A).
Ironically, it turned out separating these Boys did not help
them integrate faster; rather it increased their stress level and
marginalization in America especially those who were con-
sidered legal adults. Donkor argues in her study of the Lost
Boys that lack of proficiency in English for legal adults led
some to socialize with fellow refugees as they feared margin-
alization by the host society (Donkor, 2008). To compensate
for deficiency of bridging social capital, they often banded
Mabeya 5
together in enclave communities to provide for mutual sup-
port and to minimize expenses in their new environment.
Unlike those resettled as minors, legal adults were expected
to successfully secure employment on arrival so that they
could support themselves and repay the costs of their airfare
and other expenses from Africa, and to start the integration
process into the mainstream society with little assistance. To
get them started, they were provided with apartments rent-
free for 3 months (Mabeya, 2014, p. 131). Simultaneously,
unlike the legal adults, those who were considered minors
were placed in foster families. The foster families served as
their surrogate parents by providing them with all the basic
needs (clothes, shelter, and food). The foster families also
facilitated their entrance into American learning institutions.
Going to school helped minors acquire English language skills
and integrate them into U.S. culture by participating in school-
related activities and immersion in their home environments.
They were in a situation where they could more easily learn
English. Both at home and in school, they could complete their
education in American schools, where they could establish
social networks and friends (an important kind of social capi-
tal), and they could devote themselves to their studies and
acquire the kind of skills that would make it possible to
advance in school, complete high school, go to college, and in
some cases, obtain advanced degrees (Mabeya, 2011).
Apart from bonding and bridging social capital is linking
social capital. Linking social capital refers to unlike people
in dissimilar situations, such as connections to people with
authority/power, whether politically, socially, or economi-
cally. This enables minority and disadvantaged members to
leverage access to a wider range of resources than might be
available otherwise (Woolcock, 2001, pp. 13-14). Linking
social capital includes vertical connections to formal institu-
tions. These resources for immigrants and refugees include
social welfare, host agencies, service providers, and other
essential social services. Religious institutions in the United
States, for instance, provided the Lost Boys with support
they didn't get from their parents. Coleman argues that par-
ents are an important source of social capital to their children
(Coleman, 1988). Indeed, nearly all the Lost Boys lacked
parental guidance and upbringing Therefore, their experi-
ences were shaped by religion which provided them with
spiritual, social, physical, and material capital (though other
government agencies provided for their safety, protection,
and employment). Religious institutions also provided sol-
ace as well as an avenue under which the Lost Boys inter-
acted with other ethnic and racial groups. Some Boys met
their wives through religious organizations. Therefore par-
ticipating in religious activities gave them the ability to con-
nect and integrate with a wider population (Mabeya, 2011).
Other than religious institutions, schools and familial struc-
ture provided a means in which the Lost Boys acquired nec-
essary social capital needed for integration. Bourdieu argues
that schools provide a source of transmission of America's
valued culture which is education (Bourdieu, 1996, 1997,
p. 40-58). After acquiring education in schools, the Lost
Boys were able to convert the acquired cultural capital into
economic capital by securing employment and earning an
income. This eventually assisted them into an upward social
mobility (Mabeya, 2011).
Research Instruments and Procedure
This is a diversity-oriented study in which a multiple case
study model largely provides the methodology for the collec-
tion of data from participants (Yin, 1994). Eisenhardt asserts
that if all or nearly all the variables provide similar results,
there exists substantial support for the development of a pre-
liminary theory describing the phenomena (Eisenhardt, 1989).
This study draws from Ager and Strang's demographic
and cultural/ethnographic criteria in examining key human
development indicators to elucidate the degree of social capi-
tal each Lost Boy participant had acquired since their reset-
tlement in 2000 (see Ager & Strang, 2004, p. 3).
Data Analysis
After data collection, an analysis is done employing a the-
matic system in which common traits from the data are iden-
tified.Athematic system is utilized to provide confidentiality
of individual participants. A multiple case study framework
is used to analyze 40 cases. Common traits that emerge are
given serious consideration since they reflect major indica-
tors of integration and/or marginalization as well as the
impact of the American society on the participating Lost
Boys accrual of social capital. The common traits thus
become the major themes of this study. They are as follows:
education/professional skills, economic empowerment, and
naturalization. These themes are further synthesized using
three social capital dimensions: linking, bridging, and bond-
ing social capital (Woolcock, 2003). Eventually after the
analysis, a copy was sent to each participant for validation
and accuracy verification.
Results: Laying Down the Three Major
Themes
Interview data revealed that all participant Lost Boys consis-
tently possessed similar forms of bonding and bridging capi-
tal, but varied significantly in linking capital. This can be
attributed to the amount of social capital each Lost Boy par-
ticipant possessed by the time of this study depending on the
resettlement criteria (minors verses legal adults).
Education/Professional Skills (Bonding
Social capital)
Education is viewed as crucial to successful living and is
highly valued as a cultural capital in the United States, while
it has been given low priority in countries such as southern
6 SAGE Open
Sudan. Brophy asserts, "The education system in Southern
Sudan has always been under resourced" (Brophy, 2003,
p. 2). The Lost Boys were acutely aware that education was
the primary means of securing a good paying job. It remains
one of the most important tools of societal development; it is
through education that individuals and societies achieve eco-
nomic and social progress (Mabeya, 2011). Collier's investi-
gation reveals that protracted civil war is concentrated in
poorly educated countries and regions (Collier, 2000). He
found that chances for conflict are drastically reduced in
countries where a higher percentage of youth are attending
schools. Sommers (2002) arrive at similar conclusions,
observing that
it is war that makes the case for providing educational responses
to the needs of children and youth who are at risk of civil war
more than any other circumstance as their education is a vital
protection measure from child soldiering. (Sommers, 2002,
Summary findings ¶ 6)
For the Lost Boys, education was the gateway to a suc-
cessful life in the United States. The Lost Boys didn't have a
chance to get educated in Sudan, mainly due to a hostile envi-
ronment and lack of resources. Furthermore, most families
valued cattle over education and thus, many participants went
to the fields to look for grazing land. At the time of the inter-
views, all participants in this study were either attending edu-
cational institutions or had graduated from a 2-year college.
Academic qualification was one of the requirements used
as a criterion for resettlement in the United States. The first
group was comprised of Lost Boys resettled in the United
States with some education but not instructed in English while
they were in Africa. Acquiring proficiency in the English lan-
guage is a vital capital in the United States for immigrants. It
doesn't only enhance integration but is a necessary tool for
securing a job. With the help of resettlement agencies, this
group was placed in foster care and enrolled in schools as they
were identified as minors according to U.S. laws. The second
group arrived in the United States without any English lan-
guage skills but was expected to work upon arrival in the
United States because they were considered to be legal adults
under the U.S. law. The third group consists of Lost Boys who
arrived in the United States with elementary or high school
education. While very few participants attended school in
Sudan, all the participants in the third group received some
education at refugee camps in Ethiopia or Kenya where they
studied Arabic or English, respectively. Once resettled in the
United States, some in this group pursued further education
while others looked for jobs and began working.
The First Group
Eight participants were classified as minors upon their arrival
in the United States and were subsequently placed in foster
care. Five out of the eight had acquired some form of education
in the refugee camps in Africa. More so, residing with foster
families gave them an early opportunity improving their pro-
ficiency in English. Foster families also assisted them in pay-
ing tuition, provided housing, and helped them with other
daily living expenses. The following participant stunned me
with his level of language proficiency:
I did get support from foster families, yes I did. They would take
me to school; take me to my ummm . . . ,like if I had to run they
would come and pick me up or drop me off until I had my car.
And they actually gave me my third car, it was a Chevy Malibu
`98. It was a very nice car and they paid for it till it was done. I
am now independent . . . it's not like I need help from them
anymore. I'm living on my own. (Mabeya, 2011)
The Second Group
Eight participants in this study, considered legal adults, had
not acquired English language skills prior to resettling in the
United States. This group of Lost Boys went through the
refugee camps in Egypt and was instructed solely in Arabic.
This group faced great challenges in trying to learn English,
obtaining work, and integrating with Americans and other
African immigrants because they didn't share a common lan-
guage. They felt isolated from the rest of mainstream
American society. Moreover, this group found it difficult to
integrate with other African immigrants without a common
African language with which to communicate. According to
aUnitedNationsEducationalScientificCulturalOrganization
(UNESCO) study on "Linguistic Diversity" published by
UNESCOPRESS, there are approximately 1,400 dialects in
Africa (UNESCOPRESS, 2007),
At the time of this study, nearly all the Lost Boys lacking
significant proficiency in English were enrolled in English as
a Second Language (ESL) courses in Kansas City. With
some hard work in their studies with the English language,
they hoped not only to communicate with Americans, but
also with other nationalities present in the United States.
From my observations and listening, the following partici-
pant described great challenges of speaking English
proficiently:
Yea, it is difficult to get job because people from Kansas don't
trust you. Some people, they don't need somebody who don't
know English. That one is difficult. They are good people but
problem is English. You don't know how to speak good English,
you don't want to write good English, some people don't trust
you. That one is difficult. (Mabeya, 2011, p. 83)
The Third Group
Twenty-four participants, considered legal adults, went
through the Kenyan refugee camps of Kakuma and had
received English instruction in both elementary and high
school subjects. This group of Lost Boys joined institutions of
higher learning in Kansas City after resettling in the United
Mabeya 7
States. Some of them have graduated from a 2-year program
of study and were working, although they looked forward to
furthering their education as one participant explained:
You know what, whenever you have a higher level of education,
it is almost guaranteed will have good living standards, having a
house or raising a family, helping those back home. This is the
important things that come with having high education level.
That is how I look at it. (Mabeya, 2011)
Economic Empowerment (Bridging
Social Capital)
For the Lost Boys and other similar groups of refugees, eco-
nomic empowerment can only be attained through employ-
ment. Securing a job for most foreigners in the United States
requires complex networking with Americans and estab-
lished foreigners living in the United States. According to
Halpern's report prepared for the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services (see also U.S. RefugeeAct of 1980), eco-
nomic self-sufficiency is very important for successful reset-
tlementofrefugees(Halpern,2008).Economicself-sufficiency
is defined as the total earnings of a family that enables it to
support itself without external financial assistance according
to federal regulation (Halpern, 2008). McKinnon argued that
the resettlement program for the Lost Boys in the United
States was one of the most successful ever in U.S. history,
given that nearly all the Boys of legal age were employed after
resettlement (McKinnon, 2008). The ORR published the
employment percentage of the Lost Boys at 85%, whereas that
rate was 55% for other refugees in the United States in 2003
(ORR, 2014). Moreover, the ORR report found economic
opportunity, language, and education to be important in eco-
nomic self-sufficiency (ORR, 2007). A study done by Potocky
and McDonald identified the length of residence, citizenship,
and secondary migration to be closely related to economic
self-sufficiency (Potocky & McDonald, 1995). However,
some legal adult Lost Boys with minimal or no professional
skills found mainly manual jobs with low wages that were
unattractive and difficult to sustain. This affected the Boy's
ability to financially support themselves and attend college.
This section categorizes the participant refugee Lost Boys
into four groups relative to the major theme of employment.
Participants in the first group were resettled as minors, were
legally barred from working and instead were placed in foster
care and taken to American schools. The second group was
comprised of Boys who were considered young adults upon
arrival. The third group arrived in America with some skills
and education accrued in Africa. The fourth group acquired
employment experience and skills only after arrival in the U.S.
The First Group
Due to their young ages and scarcity of employment oppor-
tunities, 10 participants didn't work in Africa. Although they
were sent out to the fields to look after family cattle, this
wasn't generally considered a job, rather it was viewed as an
obligation to the family and these children were not paid.
This group of Lost Boys resettled in the United States under
the legal care of foster families. These families received
assistance from the government and other refugee agencies
in support of resettlement programs including financial and
food assistance, as well as tax breaks from state and federal
government. These Boys weren't allowed to work in the
United States because they were considered minors accord-
ing to U.S. laws. However, they attended school prior to
attaining working age. At the time of this research, all Boys
in this category had become young adults, moved out of their
respective foster family homes, and were living on their own
or with other Lost Boys. One participant said,
When I first came to the U.S., I was placed in a foster family in
California. I was told I was a minor by resettlement agencies. I
did not know my really age though they said my age was thirteen
years. The foster family took care of me. They paid for my
school. They were nice people. They let me play with their
children. They bought me clothes, books, and food. I really felt
at home. When I become nineteen years, they assisted me to get
a job. I got a job in a store and wanted to start living alone. So I
looked for my own house and moved out. Live in California was
too expensive and so I had to relocate to Kansas City where I
have friends and life here isn't very expensive. (Mabeya, 2011)
The Second Group
This group of eight Lost Boys were young adults when they
arrived in the United States. They were required to start
working immediately after resettlement; however, most of
them possessed no working skills prior to their arrival as they
lacked the opportunity to go to school in Africa. For those
who managed to attend school, they were handicapped as
they were instructed solely in Arabic in Egypt and spoke no
English. This group had difficulty obtaining employment
because they lacked work experience and English language
proficiency. As a result, most of them could only secure tem-
porary jobs as manual laborers. One participant said,
I don't have a job in Africa. I did not go to school in Africa. I
only took care of my family cattle. My parents had a lot of cattle.
I think the number was one to seven thousand. My grandfather
gave my dad a lot of them before he died. I like cattle a lot. Now
that I am in the U.S., I have to be on my own. I have to pay my
bills. I have to go to school and pay tuition. Man, it is a lot
difficult here. I can't get a nice paying job because I don't speak
good English. But one day when I speak good English I will get
a good job. (Mabeya, 2011)
The Third Group
This group of 10 participants possessed some education and
working skills accrued in Africa. McKinnon would identify the
resettlement of the third group of participants as "successful"
8 SAGE Open
because they secured employment and enrolled in post-
secondary educational programs (McKinnon, 2008).
Although their English wasn't perfect, they were able to learn
American English, and as a result employers were ready to
hire them. Some had work experience from their days inAfrica.
In addition, this group received educational instruction in the
Kenyan refugee camps, where English was a part of the cur-
riculum. It was easy for participants in this group to fill out an
application for employment on their own. Some of them had
already earned 2-year degrees and were working. One partici-
pant described his work experience in Africa and in the United
States in the following way (translation is word for word):
In the U.S. it is difficulty here. You don't have job, that one is
difficult because no friends to go to live with. People don't do that
here because you can work and go to school and you go to do
something good.You don't have job, that one is difficult. InAfrica,
you don't have job, it is good because some people don't care
about money. Your friends, your uncles, your aunties can help you.
You know. You eat food free, you sleep free. You know. That one
is different here. It is a nice place. Everything is good. But if you
don't have help, it is difficult. We agree. I don't have English to
write application because somebody is busy and don't have time to
fill my application. I don't have to do anything. (Mabeya, 2011)
The Fourth Group
This group of 14 participants didn't have work experience in
Africa. Most of them went to school in Kenyan refugee
camps, though they lacked work experience as job opportuni-
ties in refugee camps were limited. This group acquired
working skills in the United States only after they arrived.
This group did not have a lot of problems getting simple man-
ual jobs because they could speak English and most of them
received on-site job training. Six of these participants worked
in nursing homes and were already trained as certified nurs-
ing assistants (CNA). Here is what one participant said,
I did my high school in Kenya in the refugee camp of Kakuma.
When I arrived in the U.S., I was advised that it was easy to get
a good paying job at a nursing home but I had to have some
training. So I took a three month course and graduated as a CNA.
It was not hard for me to get a job because they need people to
work in nursing homes. Many Americans don't like doing this
job. I like it and it pays so well. (Mabeya, 2011)
Naturalization (Linking Social Capital)
After attaining the required federal residency period in the
United States, most of the refugee Lost Boys managed to
obtain U.S. citizenship by naturalization. The Fourteenth
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides the legal frame-
work for individuals of foreign countries to be naturalized in
the United States. The Refugee Act of 1980 allows refugees to
be accepted into the United States on humanitarian grounds for
unlimited stay so long as the countries of origin were still in
conflict. Refugees accepted into the United States can change
their status to permanent residents after physically living in
the United States for 1 year (Congressional Report, June
1997). Permanent residents are allowed to reside in the
United States for an unlimited period of time, and after 5
years, permanent residents can further change their status to
become fully naturalized citizens. For the Lost Boys, becom-
ing a naturalized American citizen was important because this
allowed acceptance and integration into mainstreamAmerican
society. It also provided them with access to important privi-
leges accorded to American citizens, like traveling freely in
and out of the United States, bringing their families to the
United States, claiming unemployment benefits if they lost
their jobs, access to student loans, and getting federal jobs like
joining the military.
In this section I will categorize the participant refugee
Lost Boys into three groups. The first group consists of those
who had not become American citizens. The second group is
those who had become U.S. permanent residents. The third
group is naturalized citizens.
The First Group
Fifteen participants had not become U.S. permanent resi-
dents or citizens, and they cited different reasons as to why
they hadn't done so. Among some of the reasons they gave
were the costs of processing the application to change their sta-
tus. Some said it was not their first priority because no one
forced them to leave, while others said they had not met the
required stay period for them to change status. However, every-
one in this group indicated that they were eager to change their
status in due time. They were aware of the benefits of becom-
ing a permanent resident or U.S. citizen. All participants in this
group were resettled as minors. One participant said,
I would have been long time ago but I was not able because I had
a lot of financial problems. However I would like to become a
citizen so that I can be able to fly to Africa and other places in
the world. I don't want to go to Africa and then get stuck over
there. I don't want to struggle coming back. I need to get my
citizenship so that I can be a free man. (Mabeya, 2011)
These participants said they had not visited Africa because
they were afraid they would be prevented from re-entering
the United States. They heard from others who lived in the
United States for a long time that their visas were not renewed
and they were barred from America after visiting family in
Africa. So, citizenship could guarantee their ability to travel
freely to and from Africa, and to obtain other benefits, such
as bringing their families to the United States.
The Second Group:
Composed of 15 participants, this group already successfully
applied for and became permanent U.S. residents. They said
life for them was a bit easier than when they were just refugees.
They could get student loans, travel in and out of the United
States, but they could not vote.
Mabeya 9
Man you need to understand what being a U.S. permanent
resident is. Are you one or are you a citizen? Being a permanent
resident is different from being a refugee. Refugees are treated
like not really human beings. Now that I am a permanent resident
I can do a lot of things like travelling in and out of the U.S., I can
also claim unemployment if I don't have a job. I don't care if I
don't vote because I don't like politics after all. (Mabeya, 2011)
The Third Group
This group had 10 participants who had become U.S. citi-
zens. They looked more relaxed and talked more freely than
other Lost Boys. They said they considered themselves like
any other American. Among other things, they cited they
could vote in federal elections like any American. One par-
ticipant had the following to say:
When I was living in Kakuma, there are those Americans who
were working in the refugee camps. They were so proud of
themselves. They put on everything American. I just felt like a
very low class person as compared to them. Now that I am an
American, when I travel to Africa, my friends in the refugee
camps are jealous of me. I told them I am an American and I
showed them an American passport (smile). (Mabeya, 2011)
Nearly all participants said they intended to stay in the United
States for a long time after becoming U.S. citizens, though
many of them said they were willing to go to Africa to visit
family and friends. Some were reluctant to answer this ques-
tion. One said,
That is the same question senator Sam Brownback asked me
when I met him 2007. I don't know how long I will stay here but
at some time in my life I will go back to Sudan. For now I am
here to stay. (Mabeya, 2011)
What I found from these participants is that most of them did
not care much about the responsibilities that went with
American citizenship. Most of them said they did not want to
serve in the jury, serve in the military, or vote. This participant
summarized and said what he looked forward to by saying,
I did not become an American citizen by coming here to charge
Americans. Americans gave me a chance to come over and live
with them. That is why they gave me citizenship. I am proud of
that. I am not going to send Americans to jail. That is the work
of Americans who were born here. I don't even understand some
of theAmerican crimes. I also won't want to serve in the military.
I run from war and I did not come here to go to war nor do I want
to vote. I don't like politics at all. I just want a quiet life. Build
myself and my family. (Mabeya, 2011)
Analysis
Research in this study identifies advantages and challenges
associated with arbitrarily assigning resettlement ages to
each of the Lost Boys and accrual of individual social capital
over 10 years. One of the most significant findings of this
study was that defining "experience" as a function of
assigned age proved problematic for most of the Boys;
younger Boys did not enter the job market at a "low" level.
Legal adults had started earning an income from unskilled
low paying jobs, to the envy of minors who were not allowed
to work at the time of their resettlement. Interestingly, one
can discern from this study how much more social capital is
possessed by Lost Boys who were resettled as minors more
than a decade ago.
As time went by, there is a reverse trend in terms of acqui-
sition of social capital by the younger Boys. The minors
placed under foster families' became dependents, but ended
up having a better opportunity of acquiring English lan-
guage. They were also placed in schools where they social-
ized with American children, established social networks,
and built friendships. This helped them greatly improve their
English language skills, gave them the opportunity to acquire
important kinds of social capital, and provided structure for
immersion into American culture. Eventually, these Boys
started to lose the social capital that they had brought with
them from Africa and acquired social capital of the American
society. They learned new cultural values of their new coun-
try as they settled and became Americanized. The ones who
went to school found that the social capital they brought with
them was not really valued by Americans and was insuffi-
cient at best (Donkor, 2008). In American schools, they
learned to discard (what might be considered in America)
low-value capital (working as groups, holding hands, and
forehead cuttings--that is highly valued in South Sudan) and
replaced it with higher-valued capital of the kind esteemed
by educators, employers, and American society such as
working individually, keeping time, being efficient, and
becoming successful. Their degree of social capital accrual
thus can be measured by the extent to which they were able
to discard the values of their homeland and adopt American
values. In this case, they increased their stock of American
social capital, which made them more likely to integrate into
U.S. society (Donkor, 2008). For instance, in schools they
were told how important it was to shake hands with the peo-
ple they met in interviews. They were told they could be
fired for uncleanliness, if they had body odor, or missed
work as time is important in America. Some companies fired
refugees because of body odor, thus they were advised to use
deodorant daily. They were also told to learn to speak good
English and to work hard (Mabeya, 2011).
Because they became proficient in English, this group of
Boys easily obtained better jobs after completing their col-
lege education. Some were even in supervisory positions,
managing American citizens working under them. For
instance, three participants joined the military and were
training as officer cadets by the time of this study. After com-
pletion of their cadet training, they were expected to be mili-
tary officers in rank. In athletics, Lopez Lomong, one of the
Lost Boys though not a participant in this study, was chosen
10 SAGE Open
as the U.S. flag bearer of the U.S. Olympics team in China
(Hersh, 2008). Some participants in this study like Lomong
had joined college football and basketball teams as their
physical height is advantageous in competitive sports.
Unfortunately, those Boys who were resettled as legal
adults were immediately placed to work. This group of Boys
seemed to struggle with balancing work and getting an edu-
cation. Through their experiences and my observations, they
had few opportunities to go to pursue a degree, or become
proficient in English. Legal adults largely had to fend for
themselves, thus reducing their chances of increasing their
social capital in the new host society; they were provided with
apartments rent-free for 3 months but started to pay rent
thereafter. This forced most of them to band together in
enclave communities to provide mutual support to minimize
expenses to provide stability in their new environment. This
greatly hindered their ability to learn the English language as
they socialized only with fellow refugees rather than
Americans. They feared marginalization by the host society
(Mabeya, 2011). Donkor, in her study of the Lost Boys,
argued that those Lost Boys living in ethnic enclaves were
less assimilated intoAmerican society because of difficulty in
developing social networks that included American citizens
(Donkor, 2008). In other words, they lacked social capital.
Concluding Remarks
This study examined the accrual of social capital of the
Sudanese refugee Lost Boys before and after their resettle-
ment in 2000 in the Kansas City area. What emerged out of
the age-based resettlement arrangement of the Lost Boys
reveals that those considered minors and placed in foster
families eventually became better integrated socially because
those foster families became their surrogate families thus
providing them with bonding social capital. For instance,
minors received social and educational support from the fos-
ter families, though they were behind relative to employment
when compared with the Boys settled as adults. Those Boys
settled as legal adults' endured hardships, like trying to find
employment immediately after resettlement without the ben-
efit and care of foster families, and acquiring English lan-
guage proficiency in a new country that would have provided
them with bridging social capital. This made it extremely
difficult to secure employment because they lacked skills
and/or were not proficient in English upon arrival, thus mak-
ing it difficult to acquire economic empowerment. Therefore,
as stated earlier, "experience" defined by age was a handicap
once the amount of social capital of the participants of this
study was analyzed. It was interesting from this study to find
out how much extra social capital was possessed by Lost
Boys resettled as minors relative to those resettled as adults,
especially given the fact that all of these Boys are now legal
adults living in the United States. Thus, resettlement by age
contributed greatly to accrual of social capital for those reset-
tled as minors and a barrier for those resettled as legal adults.
The legal adults had the disadvantage of having to start
working immediately, which impeded their integration into
American society. Unlike the minors, they had no support
from foster families and were unable to attend school imme-
diately after resettling. In this case, the Lost Boys, though
resettled at nearly the same time in the United States, had a
wide range of accrual of social capital and integration experi-
ences. However, one important aspect is that both groups
benefitted from support given to them by the federal and
state governments, church-based communities, and organi-
zations. This provided them with necessary linking social
capital that they needed to facilitate their integration process.
Acquiring American citizenship/naturalization allowed the
Lost Boys access to federal resources that are not easily
available to other un-naturalized immigrants or refugees.
