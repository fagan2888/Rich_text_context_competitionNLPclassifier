Sperm Competition Risk and Sexual Coercion
Predict Copulatory Duration in Humans
Nicole Barbaro1, Michael N. Pham1, and Todd K. Shackelford1
Abstract
A man whose romantic partner is sexually unfaithful is at risk of sperm competition and cuckoldry--unwitting investment in
offspring to whom he is genetically unrelated. Men, therefore, may have evolved mechanisms to solve the adaptive problems of
sperm competition and cuckoldry. The current research investigates another potential anti-cuckoldry tactic: reducing in-pair
copulation (IPC) duration, thereby more quickly placing his sperm into competition. We hypothesize that IPC duration will be
negatively correlated with female infidelity (Hypothesis 1). We further hypothesize that IPC duration will be negatively correlated
with sexual coercion (Hypothesis 2). Results of Study 1 (men's reports, n ¼ 410) indicate that both men's perceptions of female
infidelity and men's sexual coercion predict shorter IPC duration. Results of Study 2 (women's reports, n ¼ 455) did not provide
statistical support for the study hypotheses. The current research provides an initial investigation of men's adjustment of
copulatory duration and suggests that men reduce IPC duration and ejaculate more quickly at the couple's most recent copu-
lation, in response to greater risk of sperm competition and in the context of sexual coercion.

Sperm competition occurs when the sperm of two or more
males simultaneously occupy a female's reproductive tract and
compete to fertilize the ova (Parker, 1970). Sperm competition
has been demonstrated or inferred to exist in many species,
including humans (Baker & Bellis, 1993a, 1993b; Birkhead
& Moller, 1992). A recurrent context for sperm competition
in humans is female infidelity or extra-pair copulation (Baker
& Bellis, 1993b; Gallup et al., 2003; Shackelford et al., 2002;
Smith, 1984). A man whose long-term partner pursues extra-
pair copulations is at risk of sperm competition and subsequent
cuckoldry--unwitting investment in offspring to whom he is
genetically unrelated. Cuckoldry has likely been a recurrent
adaptive problem for humans (Baker & Bellis, 1995; Buss &
Shackelford, 1997; Voracek, Haubner, & Fisher, 2008).
Because human males often invest in their putative offspring
(Chrastil, Getz, Euler, & Starks, 2006; Trivers, 1972), the costs
of cuckoldry can be substantial (Leivers & Simmons, 2014).
Men, therefore, may have evolved anti-cuckoldry tactics to
prevent or to participate in sperm competition to guard their
paternity (Platek & Shackelford, 2006; Shackelford et al.,
2002, 2005). Anti-cuckoldry tactics include mate guarding
behaviors (Buss, 1988; Buss & Shackelford, 1997), frequent
in-pair copulations (IPCs; Pham, Shackelford, Holden, Zeigler-
Hill, Hummel, & Memering, 2014; Shackelford, Goetz, Guta,
& Schmitt, 2006), sexually coercing IPCs (Goetz & Shackel-
ford, 2006; reviewed in Goetz, Shackelford, & Camilleri,
2008), semen-displacing copulatory behaviors (Gallup et al.,
2003; Goetz et al., 2005), ejaculate adjustments (Baker & Bel-
lis, 1993a, 1995), partner-abuse during pregnancy (Burch &
Gallup, 2004), and adjustments in parental investment (Platek,
Burch, Panyavin, Wesserman, & Gallup, 2002).
The current research investigates another potential anti-
cuckoldry tactic: reducing IPC duration. Men who perceive
greater sperm competition risk report increased urgency to
copulate with their in-pair partner, which, in part, reflects an
urgency to submit sperm into competition (Shackelford et al.,
2002; Shackelford, Goetz, McKibbin, & Starratt, 2007; see also

Spiess, Geer, & O'Donohue, 1984). Because sexual behavior is
caused proximately by sexual arousal, reducing ejaculatory
latency and, therefore, copulatory duration, affords quicker
entry into sperm competition. We hypothesize that, in humans,
IPC duration will be negatively correlated with female infide-
lity (Hypothesis 1).
Women attempt to delay IPC following copulation with
another man (Gallup, Burch, & Mitchell, 2006), suggesting that
women may manipulate sperm competition in favor of an extra-
pair partner. In contrast, men report greater sexual interest in
their partner and greater urgency to copulate with their partner
following suspicions of her infidelity (Pham & Shackelford,
2013; Shackelford et al., 2002). As a consequence of this sexual
conflict, men may attempt to counter women's resistance to IPC
by deploying tactics of sexual coercion to gain sexual access to
their partner and quickly enter into sperm competition.
Men at greater risk of sperm competition report more fre-
quent use of sexual coercion (McKibbin, Starratt, Shackelford,
& Goetz, 2011), and women who self-report infidelity also
report that their partner is more sexually coercive (Goetz &
Shackelford, 2006, 2009). Men at greater sperm competition
risk, including men who perceive greater risk of partner infi-
delity, report greater upset in response to a partner's resistance
to IPC (Pham & Shackelford, 2013; Shackelford et al., 2002,
2007), and this upset is positively associated with men's self-
reports and women's partner reports of sexual coercion (Shack-
elford & Goetz, 2004). Research in other animals corroborates
the hypothesis that sexual coercion may function as an anti-
cuckoldry tactic (Barash, 1997; McKinney, Cheng, & Brug-
gers, 1984). In many socially monogamous birds, for example,
forced IPC reliably occurs immediately following female
extra-pair copulation (Bailey, Seymour, & Stewart, 1978;
Barash, 1997; Birkhead, Hunter, & Pellatt, 1989).
Research with other animals also indicates that forced copu-
lations are shorter in duration than nonforced copulations. For
example, males of several species of waterfowl (family Anati-
dae) often perform precopulatory displays prior to nonforced
IPCs (McKinney, Derrickson, & Mineau, 1983). During forced
IPCs, however, males do not perform precopulatory displays
(McKinney et al., 1983). This suggests that males may be
attempting to inseminate the female quickly by eliminating
precopulatory displays, affording males the opportunity to
more quickly enter their sperm into competition. Similarly,
sneak copulations in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) are shorter
in duration than courtship copulations (Pilastro, Mandelli,
Gasparini, Dadda, & Bisazza, 2007), and males who specialize
in sneak copulations experience greater sperm competition--as
indexed by their larger relative testes size (Taborsky, 1998). In
other species, reduced copulatory duration may also function to
minimize detection by another male. However, men in intimate
relationships already have regular access to their partner and
reduced copulatory duration is less likely to be an attempt to
reduce detection from a rival male and more likely to be
implemented as an anti-cuckoldry tactic.
On the basis of this comparative research, we anticipate that
sexually coercive men may also reduce IPC duration.
Therefore, we hypothesize that IPC duration will be negatively
correlated with sexual coercion (Hypothesis 2). However, sex-
ual coercion in human intimate relationships can take more
subtle forms than physically forced copulation (Goetz &
Shackelford, 2006; Shackelford & Goetz, 2004). Men who use
physical force to obtain sexual access to their partner risk
incurring severe costs, including their partner's defection from
the relationship (Goetz & Shackelford, 2006). Men, therefore,
use more subtle forms of sexual coercion before resorting to
physical force. Shackelford and Goetz (2004) identified three
components of sexual coercion that men use in intimate rela-
tionships: (1) Commitment Manipulation (e.g., ``I told my
partner that if she loved me she would have sex with me''),
(2) Defection Threat (e.g., ``I threatened to have sex with
another woman if my partner did not have sex with me''), and
(3) Resource Manipulation/Violence (e.g., ``I withheld bene-
fits that my partner depends on to get her to have sex with
me''; ``I threatened to physically force my partner to have sex
with me'').
In summary, we propose that, in response to suspicions of
female infidelity, men deploy anti-cuckoldry tactics to enter
their sperm into competition to guard their paternity. Specifi-
cally, following perceptions of female infidelity, men may use
sexual coercion to counter women's resistance to IPC and
quickly inseminate their partner to increase their chances of
success in sperm competition. We conducted two independent
studies to test two hypotheses derived from sperm competition
theory. In Study 1, we secured men's reports on the target
variables, and in Study 2, we secured women's reports on these
same variables.
Study 1: Men's Reports
Study 1 secured men's reports to test the hypothesized relation-
ships between perceptions of female infidelity, sexual coer-
cion, and IPC duration. Following Goetz and Shackelford
(2006), we operationalized sperm competition risk as men's
perceptions of their partner's past infidelity and likelihood of
future infidelity.
Method
Participants
Participants were 410 men in a committed, heterosexual, sexual
relationship for at least 1 month. The mean age of participants
was 24.6 years (SD ¼ 8.0), the mean age of the men's partners
was 23.3 years (SD ¼ 7.4), and the mean relationship length was
39.0 months (SD ¼ 61.3). Approximately half of the participants
were university students, and the other half of participants
were from communities surrounding the university where the
research was conducted.
Materials
Participants completed an anonymous survey that requested
demographic information, including the participant's age, their
2 Evolutionary Psychology
partner's age, and the length of their relationship. Participants
then answered questions about their partner's infidelities, their
own use of sexually coercive tactics, and their most recent IPC.
Partner's infidelity. Men were asked four questions about their
partner's infidelity: ``As far as you know, has your current
partner had sexual intercourse [fallen in love] with someone
other than you since you have been involved in a relationship
together?''; How likely do you think it is that your current
partner will in the future have sexual intercourse [fall in love]
with someone other than you, while in a relationship with
you?'' Men responded to each question on a 10-point Likert-
type scale ranging from 0 (definitely no/not at all likely) to 9
(definitely yes/extremely likely). We calculated the mean of the
responses to the four questions to create a composite variable
female infidelity (a ¼ .71) for each participant as an indicator of
sperm competition risk.
IPC duration. Men reported on the relative duration of their last
copulation with their partner in which the man ejaculated as a
result of penetrative, penile-vaginal sex, by responding to the
question ``In comparison to what is typical, how long did sex-
ual intercourse with your partner last?'' on a 10-point Likert-
type scale ranging from 0 (much less time than is typical) to 9
(much more time than is typical). We asked participants to
indicate the relative length of time that copulation lasted, rather
than absolute length of time (e.g., in minutes) that copulation
lasted. On average, IPC duration in humans is approximately
five to six minutes; however, IPC duration can, in rare
instances, last upward of 45 minutes (Waldinger et al., 2005).
By assessing relative copulation duration, we are able to con-
trol for individual differences in participant's average length of
IPC that, for example, may be influenced by motivations to
sexually please a romantic partner.
Sexual coercion. The Sexual Coercion in Intimate Relationships
Scale (SCIRS; Shackelford & Goetz, 2004) was used to assess
men's use of sexually coercive acts in their current relationship.
The SCIRS asks how often men performed 34 sexually coer-
cive acts in the past one month. Participants respond to each
item on a 6-point scale (0 ¼ act never occurred; 1 ¼ act
occurred 1 time; 2 ¼ act occurred 2 times; 3 ¼ act occurred
3­5 times; 4 ¼ act occurred 6­10 times; 5 ¼ act occurred 11 or
more times). Responses to each statement were recoded as the
midpoint of the response category the participant reported. For
example, if the participant reported an act occurring ``3­5 times
in the past month,'' the response was recoded as occurring
4 times in the past month. Responses indicating ``act occurred
11 or more times'' were recoded as occurring 15 times in the past
month. The SCIRS assesses three components: Commitment
Manipulation, Defection Threat, and Resource Manipulation/
Violence (see above for sample items). Following Shackelford
and Goetz (2004), composite scores were calculated by sum-
ming the recoded response category midpoints for the appropri-
ate items, yielding a composite score for each participant for
overall sexual coercion and each sexual coercion component.
Procedure
The current research was approved by the institutional review
board at the university at which the research was conducted.
Participants who met the following criteria were eligible for the
current study: (1) male, (2) at least 18 years old, and (3) cur-
rently in a committed, heterosexual, sexual relationship for at
least 1 month. Prospective participants arrived at a specified
location and read a consent form. Participants who met the
criteria and agreed to participate completed a survey and
returned the completed survey to the researcher in an
unmarked, sealed envelope.
Results
Zero-order correlations and descriptive statistics for the target
variables are reported in Table 1. Relationship length was not
correlated with the predictor variables (i.e., female infidelity
and sexual coercion) and is therefore not included as a con-
founding variable in subsequent analyses. We calculated a
zero-order correlation between perceived female infidelity and
IPC duration to test whether female infidelity--as a measure of
sperm competition risk--is associated with shorter IPC dura-
tion. The result supports Hypothesis 1 in that greater perceived
sperm competition risk is correlated with shorter IPC duration
(see Table 1).

We calculated a zero-order correlation to test whether sex-
ual coercion is associated with shorter IPC duration. The result
provides support for Hypothesis 2 in that that men who report
more frequent use of sexually coercive Commitment Manipu-
lation acts also report shorter IPC duration (see Table 1). A
multiple linear regression was conducted as a more stringent
test of Hypothesis 2. The three sexual coercion components
(Commitment Manipulation, Defection Threat, and Resource
Manipulation/Violence) were simultaneously entered into the
regression analysis, with IPC duration as the dependent vari-
able (see Table 2). Men's use of sexually coercive Commit-
ment Manipulation acts remained the best predictor of IPC
duration, approaching statistical significance (p ¼ .07).
Study 2: Women's Reports
Men's reports of their partner's infidelities and their use of
sexual coercion may be inaccurate (Dobash, Dobash, Cava-
nagh, & Lewis, 1998; Edleson & Brygger, 1986). Study 2
secured reports from an independent sample of women to
examine the hypothesized relationships between female infide-
lity, men's use of sexual coercion, and IPC duration.
Method
Participants
Participants were 455 women in a committed, heterosexual,
sexual relationship for at least 1 month. Women in this study
were not necessarily partnered to the men in Study 1. The mean
age of the participant was 22.1 years (SD ¼ 5.7), the mean age
of the women's partner was 24.4 years (SD ¼ 6.9), and the
mean relationship length was 31.4 months (SD ¼ 41.8 months).
Approximately half of the participants were university stu-
dents, and the other half of participants were from communities
surrounding the university where the research was conducted.
Materials
The survey used in Study 2 was parallel to the survey used in
Study 1, with appropriate replacement of gender-relevant
terms.
Self-reported infidelity. Women were asked four questions to
assess their past infidelities and the likelihood of committing
future infidelities. Women responded ``yes'' or ``no'' to the
question: ``Have you had sexual intercourse with someone
other than your current partner since you have been involved
in a relationship with your current partner?'' Dichotomous
responses to the past sexual infidelity question were recoded
such that a ``no'' response was recoded ``0,'' and a ``yes''
response was recoded ``9.'' Women also responded to the ques-
tions: ``Have you fallen in love with someone other than your
current partner since you have been involved in a relationship
with your current partner?'' and ``How likely do you think it is
that you will in the future have sexual intercourse [fall in love]
with someone other than your current partner, while in a rela-
tionship with your current partner?'' Women responded to
these questions on a 10-point Likert-type scale ranging from
0 (definitely no/not at all likely) to 9 (definitely yes/extremely
likely). We then averaged responses to the four questions to
create a composite variable female infidelity (a ¼ .60) for each
participant as an indicator of sperm competition risk.
IPC duration. In parallel with Study 1, women reported on the
relative duration of their last copulation with their partner in
which their partner ejaculated as a result of penetrative, penile-
vaginal sex, by responding to the question ``In comparison to
what is typical, how long did sexual intercourse with your
partner last?'' on a 10-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0
(much less time than is typical) to 9 (much more time than is
typical).
Partner's use of sexual coercion. In parallel with Study 1, women
completed the SCIRS (Shackelford & Goetz, 2004) to report
their partner's use of sexual coercion. Following Shackelford
and Goetz (2004), we calculated participant's composite scores
for overall sexual coercion and each sexual coercion compo-
nent (i.e., Commitment Manipulation, Defection Threat, and
Resource Manipulation/Violence).
Procedure
The current research was approved by the institutional review
board at the university at which the research was conducted.
Participants who met the following criteria were eligible for the
current study: (1) female, (2), at least 18 years old, and (3)
currently in a committed, heterosexual, sexual relationship for
at least 1 month. Prospective participants arrived at a specified
location and read a consent form. Participants who met the
criteria and agreed to participate completed a survey and
returned the completed survey to the researcher in an
unmarked, sealed envelope.
Results
Zero-order correlations and descriptive statistics for the target
variables are reported in Table 3. Relationship length was not
correlated with the predictor variables (i.e., female infidelity
and sexual coercion) and is therefore not included as a con-
founding variable in subsequent analyses. We calculated a
zero-order correlation between self-reported infidelity and IPC
duration to investigate whether female infidelity is associated
with shorter IPC duration. The correlation between women's

significant (see Table 3).
We calculated a zero-order correlation to investigate
whether women's reports of their partner's sexual coercion is
correlated with shorter IPC duration. The correlations between
the three sexual coercion components and IPC duration were
not statistically significant (see Table 3). A multiple linear
regression was conducted as a more stringent test of Hypothesis
2. The three sexual coercion components (Commitment Manip-
ulation, Defection Threat, and Resource Manipulation/Vio-
lence) were simultaneously entered into the regression
analysis, with IPC duration as the dependent variable (see
Table 4). Women's reports of their partner's use of sexually
coercive Defection Threat acts were the best predictor of IPC
duration, approaching statistical significance (p ¼ .07).
General Discussion
The results of Study 1 (men's reports) support Hypothesis 1 in
that perceptions of female infidelity are correlated with shorter
relative IPC duration. The results of Study 1 also support
Hypothesis 2 in that men's use of sexually coercive Commit-
ment Manipulation is correlated with shorter relative IPC dura-
tion. The results of Study 2 (women's reports), however, do not
provide statistical support for Hypotheses 1 and 2: The correla-
tion between women's self-reported infidelities and IPC dura-
tion, and between women's reports of their partner's use of
sexually coercive acts and IPC duration, is not statistically
significant.
Tests of Hypothesis 1 investigated whether IPC duration is
shorter in response to sperm competition risk--operationalized
as female infidelity. Men's reports indicate that as perception
of sperm competition risk increases, the duration of IPC
decreases. We suggest that circumstances indicative of sperm
competition--specifically, a man's partner's extra-pair copula-
tion--motivate men to enter their sperm into competition as
quickly as possible, resulting in relatively shorter IPC duration.
Women's reports do not replicate this relationship, although
women's reports of their partner's use of sexually coercive
Defection Threat acts approached statistical significance.
Men may face a trade-off in copulatory strategies following
female infidelity: Quickly enter sperm into competition or per-
form semen-displacement behaviors to extract rival sperm
from the vagina. Consequently, IPC duration may be relatively
shorter or longer, respectively, depending on the copulatory
strategy a man pursues. Men's copulatory strategy might be
determined by whether they are attempting to prevent or cor-
rect female infidelity (Shackelford, 2003). We operationalized
sperm competition risk in Study 1 as men's perception of
female infidelity. The results indicate that men engage in
shorter IPC when they perceive greater risk or likelihood of
female infidelity, which we suggest is a corrective sperm com-
petition strategy. Goetz and colleagues (2005) suggested that
men might pursue longer duration of IPC as a corrective strat-
egy in response to sperm competition risk--operationalized in
their research as female partner attractiveness. However, a
partner's attractiveness can also motivate men to prevent infi-
delity because her attractiveness portends that she is more
likely to have extra-pair suitors. Thus, the relationship between
female attractiveness and longer IPC duration might also be
indicative of men's attempts to prevent partner infidelity (see
Buss, 1988; Buss & Shackelford, 1997).
The IPC duration and, consequently, the copulatory strategy
men deploy, might be affected by a variable not measured in
the current research or in Goetz et al.'s (2005) research: the
time since a woman's suspected or known extra-pair copula-
tion. The time since a women's extra-pair copulation might
affect men's copulatory strategy at the next IPC. For example,
longer copulation duration--which includes more semen-
displacing behaviors--might be a more effective sperm com-
petition strategy in circumstances in which the time between a
woman's copulation with an extra-pair partner and an in-pair

partner is brief. Under these circumstances, a rival man's sperm
and spermicidal substances have not yet been ejected from the
vagina (e.g., less than 1 hour; Baker & Bellis, 1993b, 1995),
and reduced ejaculatory latency may adversely affect semen
displacement (Gallup & Burch, 2004). Shorter copulation dura-
tion--quickly entering sperm into competition--might be
more likely in circumstances in which the time between a
woman's extra-pair copulation and IPC is longer (e.g., more
than 1 hour; Baker & Bellis, 1993b), and it is unlikely that rival
sperm are still present in the vagina. After sperm are ejected
from the vagina, adjusting IPC duration to be shorter--ejacu-
lating quickly--may be a more successful sperm competition
strategy (but see, Gallup & Burch, 2004). This hypothesis is
contingent on two factors: (1) the duration of how long sperm
remain in the vagina (i.e., the ``corrective window''; Baker &
Bellis, 1995; Johnson & Everitt, 1995; Morris, 1977; Smith,
1984), and (2) a woman's behavior after sexual intercourse
(Gallup & Burch, 2006; but see, Baker & Bellis, 1995). Our
understanding of men's strategies to correct or prevent female
infidelity (Shackelford, 2003), such as extending IPC duration
to facilitate semen displacement, would be informed by asses-
sing the time between a woman's perceived or actual extra-pair
copulation and the next IPC.
Men's reports indicate a relationship between sexually coer-
cive Commitment Manipulation and shorter IPC, supporting
Hypothesis 2. This suggests that the duration of coercive sex
is shorter than consensual sex, consistent with the results of
research on nonhumans (e.g., waterfowl; McKinney et al.,
1983). The current research is the first to investigate copulatory
behavior--in particular, copulation duration--associated with
reports of sexual coercion in humans. Men who employ sexual
coercion to secure IPCs may be pursuing a copulatory strategy
that affords quick entry into sperm competition, rather than a
strategy to displace rival sperm that may be present.
The nonsignificant relationship between women's reports of
their infidelity and shorter IPC duration may be a result of a
perceptual bias unique to the context of sexually coercive copu-
lations. Because sexual coercion is often psychologically trau-
matizing for women (Campbell, 1989; Thornhill & Thornhill,
1990, 1991), women's reports of copulation duration and/or the
frequency of sexual coercion may differ from men's reports.
Recent research (B´
elanger, Mathieu, Dugal, & Courchesne,
2015) conducted with romantic couples indicates that, com-
pared to their male partner, women significantly underreport
instances of sexually coercive behavior (measured by the
Conflict Tactics Scale; Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, &
Sugarman, 1996). Discrepancies between male and female
reports may account for the sex differences observed in the
current research. Nevertheless, men's reports suggest that
future research might profitably investigate sexually coercive
copulatory behaviors and strategies. Future research could
secure data from both romantic partners to obtain more accu-
rate corroborating reports of sexual behavior in intimate
relationships.
The results of the current research are not conclusive regard-
ing the relationships between sperm competition risk, sexual
coercion, and copulation duration. Men's reports (Study 1)
provide support for the study hypotheses, but women's reports
(Study 2) do not corroborate these findings. The current
research offers an initial investigation into adjustments of
copulatory duration in humans--a domain that has not yet been
explored. Future research that addresses the limitations of the
current studies (see below) could continue to profitably inves-
tigate copulation duration in humans.
Limitations and Future Directions
The current research secured data from independent samples of
men and women. Although securing men's reports and
women's reports of the same behaviors might afford triangu-
lating on reliable assessments of the relevant phenomena, the
current data are limited in that we secured data from men and
women who were not partnered to one another. Future research
might secure daily reports from both members of couples to
afford more reliable assessments of sexual coercion and related
copulatory behaviors in intimate relationships.
Another limitation is that we assessed the duration of the
most recent IPC. In contrast, we assessed the frequency with
which men performed sexually coercive acts during the previ-
ous one month. Because of the difference in assessment time
frame for the two variables, we cannot be certain that sexual
coercion was used to secure the copulation about which parti-
cipants reported. Future research addressing sexual coercion in
intimate relationships and copulatory behaviors could secure
reports about sexually coercive acts used to achieve a specific
IPC. Additionally, research could investigate the average time
of IPCs or average time in the previous one month (e.g., in
minutes) to afford congruence between measures of sexual
coercion and copulatory duration. This would afford stronger
claims about whether and how the use of sexual coercion is
related to copulation duration in response to female infidelity.
Moreover, we secured a relative measure of copulatory
duration (how long copulation lasted compared to ``what is
normal for you''), rather than an absolute measure of copula-
tion duration (how long copulation lasted, in minutes).
Although our measure of copulation duration afforded control
of individual differences in copulation duration, we suggest
that future research investigates absolute length of copulation
duration. Because the upper limits of copulation duration in
humans (e.g., 45 min; Waldinger et al., 2005) may indicate
an increased motivation to sexually please one's partner, the
absolute duration of copulation could provide useful informa-
tion regarding whether--under circumstances of increased
sperm competition risk--men are less inclined to sexually
please their partner for the benefit of entering their sperm into
competition more quickly.
Finally, the results of the current research are correlational,
and thus strong statements of causality are not defensible.
Based on the available literature, however, we argue that men's
copulatory behaviors and use of sexual coercion are motivated
by increased sperm competition risk--in particular, by per-
ceived or actual female infidelity. It is possible, however, that
6 Evolutionary Psychology
men's sexual coercion motivates women to pursue extra-pair
copulations or eventually to terminate the relationship.
Conclusion
Female infidelity is a primary context in which sperm compe-
tition might have occurred over human evolutionary history
and may have occasionally resulted in cuckoldry. Because
cuckoldry can inflict substantial costs on paternally investing
males, men may have evolved strategies to solve this class of
adaptive problems. We tested the hypotheses that female infi-
delity and men's use of sexual coercion are associated with
shorter IPC duration. Men's reports indicate that perceptions
of their partner's infidelity are correlated with shorter IPC
duration, which we argue reflects a copulatory strategy to
quickly enter sperm into competition. Men's reports also indi-
cate that sexually coercive men reduce IPC duration. These
findings contribute to our understanding of men's use of sexual
coercion in intimate relationships and, more generally, to our
understanding of human male adaptations to sperm
competition.
