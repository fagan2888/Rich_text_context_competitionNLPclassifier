Abstract
Objective: To identify the prognostic factors for local recurrence of giant cell tumor of bone
(GCTB) through assessment of the preoperative imaging features of the tumor border.
Methods: Patients with GCTBs treated with intralesional procedures in the proximal tibia and
distal femur were prospectively enrolled and then followed up for at least 2 years. The GCTBs
were grouped according to their preoperative imaging features. GCTBs treated with en bloc
resection were enrolled for investigation of the pathologic basis of specific imaging features.
Differences between rates were evaluated by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test;
independent factors were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Results: Fifty-three patients were enrolled and successfully followed up. Relapse occurred in 22
patients. Patients with a ``paintbrush borders'' sign (n ¼ 21) had a significantly higher rate of local
recurrence (71.43%) than patients without this sign (21.88%). The ``paintbrush borders'' sign was
identified as an independent prognostic factor for local recurrence. Other imaging features were
not significantly associated with recurrence. The ``paintbrush borders'' sign showed a correlation
with local invasion of bone.

Introduction
Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is one of
the most prevalent bone tumors, accounting
for 20% of all musculoskeletal tumors in
East and Southeast Asia compared with
approximately 5% in Western countries.1,2
GCTB exhibits locally destructive behavior
that leads to significant osteolysis,3,4 and it is
mainly treated with curettage. As an inter-
mediate tumor with a tendency for local
invasion, GCTB treated with curettage has a
high rate of local recurrence (13%­65%)
and thus poses a great challenge for clinical
treatment.5,6
Prognostic factors for local recurrence
play a key role in the preoperative planning
of surgical procedures. We reviewed the
literature regarding prognostic factors for
local recurrence of GCTB but obtained far
too few reliable results. Authors seldom
draw unanimous conclusions, and the prog-
nostic factors for GCTB remain ambiguous
and controversial. Previously reported
prognostic factors include age,5,7 location,2
Campanacci classification,8,9 soft tissue
extension,6,10 and pathologic fracture.11
However, all of these disease-related factors
were excluded in other equivalent stu-
dies.12­15 Additionally, most of these studies
were retrospective with limited sample sizes.
The presence of a residual tumor after
surgery has been considered responsible for
recurrence6; therefore, the imaging features
of the tumor border, which are potentially
associated with the liability of the residual
tumor, are worthy of clinical investigation.
Medical imaging is a noninvasive method
that can provide diverse information regard-
ing GCTB,16 including its characteristics
and impact on surrounding regions. A
radiographic classification of bone tumor
margins has been developed.17,18 However,
anatomic overlap can obscure abnormal-
ities, and the classification has a limited
capacity to evaluate soft tissue. Radiographs
are limited to determination of the relation-
ship between bone tumors and their
surrounding structures and the extent of
disease in the intact marrow cavity.18
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
especially valuable for evaluation of muscu-
loskeletal tumors because of its heightened
sensitivity to soft tissue disease and multi-
planar image acquisition.19­21
In the present study, we investigated the
preoperative imaging features of the GCTB
border, including peritumoral edema, the
``paintbrush borders'' sign, bony ridges, and
loss of the bone cortex. In accordance with
some authors,16,22­24 we recommend
establishment of a new and standardized
evaluation system to investigate the prog-
nostic factors of GCTB. The knee is the site
of predilection for GCTB12 and is a major
weight-loading joint. Therefore, we investi-
gated prognostic factors through prospect-
ive enrollment of patients with GCTB
around the knee joint. The patients were
followed up for at least 2 years.
Furthermore, preoperative imaging features
were investigated through their correlation
with gross pathologic sections of surgical
specimens.

Materials and methods
Patients
This study was approved by the institutional
review board of our hospital, the methods
were carried out in accordance with the
relevant guidelines and regulations, and
written informed consent was obtained
from all patients for the use of their clinical
and imaging data in this study. The study
design is presented in Figure 1. The eligibil-
ity requirements were histopathologically
confirmed GCTB; tumor location in the
proximal tibia and distal femur; perform-
ance of intralesional curettage with
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) packing,
which is the preferred standard treatment
for GCTB and is performed consistently by
a subgroup of orthopedic specialists in our
hospital; performance of MRI and com-
puted tomography (CT) examination before
surgery; and a follow-up duration of >2
years. Patients with GCTB were prospect-
ively registered in this study from January
2005 to July 2015. Among them, patients
with pathological fractures and soft tissue
masses were excluded. Patients with GCTBs
treated with en bloc resection were enrolled
only for investigation of the pathologic basis
of specific imaging features.
Imaging procedures
CT examinations were performed with a
64-slice CT scanner (LightSpeed VCT;
General Electric Medical Systems,
Milwaukee, WI, USA) according to a rou-
tine protocol. The bone window, soft tissue
window, and two-dimensional acquisition
were used for observation.
MRI examinations were performed on a
1.5-T superconducting whole-body imager
(SIGNA; General Electric Medical Systems)
with dedicated knee coils.
A combination of axial, sagittal, and
coronal images was obtained using the fol-
lowing sequences: spin-echo T1-weighted
(repetition time [TR] range/echo time [TE]
range, 450­600 ms/15­20 ms), fast spin-echo
T2-weighted (TR range/TE range, 3500­
4000ms/80­120 ms), and fat-suppressed fast
spin-echo T2-weighted (TR range/TE range,

3500­4000 ms/80­120 ms). The field of view,
slice thickness, and interslice gap varied
depending on the diseased region and
tumor size. The imaging matrix ranged
from 192 Â 256 to 256 Â 256.
All patients routinely underwent
anteroposterior and lateral plain radio-
graphs for reexamination.
Objective features and groups
Preoperative imaging features, including
peritumoral edema, the ``paintbrush bor-
ders'' sign, formation of bony ridges, and
loss of the bone cortex, were observed in the
axial, sagittal, and coronal planes.
Bony ridges were defined as focally
thickened bone trabeculae or ridge forma-
tion on the bone rim, visible on CT scans.
The bone window was effective for observa-
tion of bony ridges. Patients were classified
into the positive group if bony ridges were
found, regardless of the number of bony
ridges.
GCTB margins are often relatively well-
defined or show irregular penetration. The
``paintbrush borders'' sign was descriptively
defined as the presence of penetrating irregu-
lar margins with a ``paintbrush'' appearance
protruding toward the bone, visible on
MRI. Because of the stark contrast between
the high signal intensity of the bone marrow
and the low signal intensity of tumor tissue,
T1-weighted images more effectively showed
irregular protrusions than did other
sequences. Patients were classified into the
positive group if the ``paintbrush borders''
sign was found, irrespective of the number
or shape of the sign.
Peritumoral edema appeared as high
signal intensity on fat-suppressed MRI and
indicated the presence of joint effusion and
edema. GCTBs were classified into two
grades: grade A was defined as massive
edema or significantly high signal intensity
on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images, and
grade B was defined as limited edema or
minimally increased signal intensity on fat-
suppressed T2-weighted images.
Cortical bone destruction can be detected
by CT or MRI. In this study, loss of the
bone cortex was defined as discontinuity
(shown as low signal intensity) of the nor-
mally high-density bone cortex on the MRI
bone window.
All these features were evaluated using
noncontrast MRI/CT and interpreted by
three senior musculoskeletal radiologists
(Y.L., 17 years of experience; J.Z., 23
years of experience; and X.D., 25 years of
experience). The radiologists discussed the
findings until consensus was reached. If
consensus could not be reached, the major-
ity opinion was used for analysis. GCTBs
were classified into positive and negative
groups according to the preoperative ima-
ging features.
Intralesional procedure
The intralesional procedure performed in
each patient was explicitly recorded in the
medical records. All 55 patients underwent
intralesional curettage conducted by a
senior orthopedic surgeon (J.X., 19 years
of experience). A wide cortical window was
created, and the tumor tissue was removed
with a curette. The remainder of the tumor
cavity was then eliminated with a high-speed
burr. Phenol was applied in the borders of
the cavity with a cotton-tipped applicator
and then neutralized with alcohol in 31
patients; the remaining 24 patients were
treated without an additional adjuvant.
Finally, the tumor cavity was carefully
packed with PMMA filling.
Follow-up and recurrence
All patients underwent annual reexamina-
tion by X-ray or MRI regardless of whether
they were symptomatic. Patients who were
unable to be re-examined in our hospital
were followed up by telephone, letter
He et al. 713
exchange, or in-person visits. All patients
were followed up for at least 2 years.
Extension of the radiolucent zone on
radiographs after bone cement filling was a
reliable indicator of possible local
recurrence. The recurrent tumor, which
was represented by high signal intensity
around the PMMA on T2-weighted ima-
ging, could be directly identified. The
patients were immediately re-examined if
any tumor-associated symptoms (abnormal
pain and swelling) occurred after surgery.
Recurrent GCTBs were diagnosed by patho-
logical results. Follow-up could be halted if
the GCTB recurred.
Correlation with pathology
Surgical specimens were obtained from two
patients treated by en bloc resection.
According to the acquired images, forma-
lin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens were
sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using
SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
Categorical variables are presented as
percent and absolute number of patients.
The distributions of the frequencies of
dichotomous attributes in each group were
assessed using the chi-square test or Fisher's
exact test, as appropriate. Independent fac-
tors were identified by multivariate logistic
regression analysis. All P values were two-
sided, and a value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
Sixty-seven consecutive patients prospect-
ively registered in this study. Among them,
five patients with pathological fractures and
four patients with soft tissue masses were
excluded. Therefore, 58 patients were eli-
gible for this study (30 men and 28 women;
median age, 29 years; age range, 18­64
years). The patients were grouped according
to their preoperative imaging features
(Figures 2­4), including peritumoral
edema, the ``paintbrush borders'' sign,
bony ridges, and loss of bone cortex. The
characteristics of all patients are detailed in
Table 1.
Follow-up and local recurrence
Fifty-three patients (91.38%) were followed
up successfully, while five patients were lost
to follow-up. Twenty-two patients (43.75%)
were finally diagnosed with recurrence
(average time of recurrence, 22.82 months),
of whom 19 patients (86.36%) developed
recurrence within 2 years (average, 15.05
months). For the remaining three patients
with recurrence, the time of recurrence was
beyond 2 years (during the fifth year post-
operatively in two patients and during the
eighth year postoperatively in one patient).
For the patients without recurrence, the
follow-up period ranged from 2.0 to 9.5
years (average, 5.61 years).
Prognosis of local recurrence
Among all 53 patients, 21 showed the
``paintbrush borders'' sign. Fifteen of these
21 patients developed recurrence (recurrence
rate, 71.43%). Of the remaining 32 patients
without the ``paintbrush borders'' sign,
7 developed recurrence (recurrence rate,
21.88%; 2 ¼ 12.82, P < 0.001). The other
preoperative imaging features showed no
statistically significant relationship with
recurrence (Table 2).
Multivariate logistic regression analysis
was performed to assess the impact of the
``paintbrush borders'' sign on the prognosis
of local recurrence. The ``Paintbrush bor-
ders'' sign was identified as an independent
714 Journal of International Medical Research 46(2)
prognostic factor for GCTB after intrale-
sional curettage (P < 0.05) (Table 3).
Control of confounding factors
Twenty-nine of 31 patients treated with
additional adjuvants were successfully fol-
lowed up. The recurrence rates were not
significantly different between the patients
with and without an additional adjuvant.
The recurrence rates were also not signifi-
cantly different between the patients
enrolled in earlier years and those enrolled
in later years (Table 2).
Comparison of preoperative imaging
features with pathology
Gross pathologic sections were made and
visually matched with the acquired images.
The lengths of the protrusions varied from 1.5
to 3.6 mm on MRI, according to our data-
base. In one of the patients who underwent en
bloc resection, the lengths of the protrusions
varied from 1.2 to 3.3 mm on gross pathologic
sections and from 1.6 to 3.2 mm on MRI.
Multinucleated giant cells were uniformly
distributed among monocytes within
the protrusions (Figure 4), and the

sign of recurrence was found after 9.5 years of follow-up. (a) Axial computed tomography shows spine-like

edge of the tumor. (d) Sagittal fat-suppressed T2-weighted image shows minimal and limited peritumoral
edema, which was classified as grade B in this study.

``paintbrush borders'' sign on preoperative
MRI correlated with the gross pathologic
sections (Figure 5). In addition, bony ridges
and loss of the bone cortex were clearly
observed on CT. However, edema could not
be evaluated because the pathological sec-
tions were dehydrated.
Discussion
This study is the first to identify the MRI
feature of the ``paintbrush borders'' sign as
an independent prognostic factor for local
recurrence of GCTB after intralesional cur-
ettage. This sign, which is characterized by
marginal infiltration on MRI, pathologic-
ally confirmed to represent invasion of bone
around the tumor.
Intralesional procedures are a preferred
approach to GCTB but are challenged by
local recurrence. Residual tumor tissue is
associated with local recurrence after sur-
gery and is a vital concern when performing
intralesional procedures.5,6 This inspired us

to focus on the MRI and CT features of the
tumor border to explore prognostic factors
associated with residual tumors. However,
despite the fact that the Lodwick grading
system and modified Lodwick­Madewell
grading system are well established, our
literature review revealed no studies evaluat-
ing the preoperative MRI features of the bor-
der of GCTBs.25 The present study is the first
to evaluate the association between the pre-
operative MRI features of the border of
GCTBs and the prognosis of these tumors.
The ``paintbrush borders'' sign is a
common feature that can be found on
conventional MRI but has been neglected
in previous studies. This sign should be
correlated with pathological findings to
determine its clinical value. Therefore, we
explored the pathologic basis of the ``paint-
brush borders'' sign on MRI and found
osteoclastic giant cells uniformly distributed
among monocytes within the protrusions.
Gross pathologic sections showed that the
``paintbrush borders'' sign represented inva-
sion of bone around the lesion. The gross
pathologic sections visually matched the
specific findings on the images.
Invasion of bone around a GCTB could
be interpreted as one cause of residual
tumors. The penetrating irregular margins
might decrease the effect of intralesional
treatment. We have herein provided reliable
evidence to substantiate the viewpoint that
residual tumors may be a major culprit in
local recurrence and identified the ``paint-
brush borders'' sign as an independent
prognostic factor for local recurrence of
GCTBs. When penetrating irregular mar-
gins are detected by MRI in the clinical
setting, surgeons should consider the pres-
ence of a GCTB and make every effort to
thoroughly eliminate residual tumor tissue
in the region of the irregular protrusions.
This prospective study of GCTBs has pro-
vided evidence that inclusion of this novel
sign on preoperative MRI might help to
guide surgical treatment and reduce local
recurrence.
With respect to the molecular prognostic
factors of GCTB, the expression of some
osteolysis-associated factors might be ele-
vated in GCTB with the ``paintbrush bor-
ders'' sign. It can be reasonably speculated
that osteoclast activity and its related fac-
tors, such as the receptor activator of
nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)/
RANK/osteoprotegerin signaling pathway,
matrix metalloproteinases, and tumor
necrosis factor-a, might be pivots between
osteolysis/formation of the ``paintbrush bor-
ders'' sign and local recurrence. In one study
of bone malignancies, nuclear factor I-B,
RANK, and RANKL co-overexpression
was identified as a potential discriminating
factor of a poor prognosis.26 Kumta et al.27
demonstrated that matrix metalloproteinase
9 expression in GCTBs was well correlated
with local recurrence. Further research is
required to clarify these findings.

Unexpectedly, the other three peripheral
features (bony ridges, peritumoral edema,
and loss of the bone cortex) failed to predict
outcomes. This could be explained as fol-
lows. 1) Although bony ridges cause
difficulty performing curettage, they can be
worn smooth with a high-speed burr, sub-
stantially reducing their clinical impact. 2)
Theoretically, peritumoral edema is a reac-
tion to the tumor activity and is associated
with the aggressiveness of GCTB. Based on
our negative result, however, we speculate
that many confounding factors, such as
osteosclerosis, also play roles in the devel-
opment of edema. 3) Loss of the bone cortex
is a result of the aggressiveness of GCTB.
Additionally, Chen et al.10 demonstrated the
role of soft tissue masses in prognosis of
GCTB. However, we did not arrive at the
same conclusion in terms of loss of the bone
cortex. In the early stage before the forma-
tion of a soft tissue mass, adjacent bone
invasion is more amenable to clinical treat-
ment. Surgeons should always select a bone
window containing loss of the bone cortex
or a thinner bone cortex to perform surgery.
The impact of demographic factors on
local recurrence is also an important factor
associated with clinical management.
Siddiqui et al.2 reported that local recur-
rence of GCTB in the proximal tibia (recur-
rence rate of 60%) is higher than that in
Figure 4. A 23-year-old woman with a giant cell tumor of bone treated with en bloc resection. (a, b) The

were taken from this coronal section. (c) Coronal T2-weighted image shows the ``paintbrush borders'' sign at

other locations. This could explain why our
overall recurrence rate (43.75%) seems
extremely high. However, the higher rates
of local relapse in the proximal tibia were
mostly derived from statistical analyses
without convincing investigations to explain
these findings. Kivioja et al.7 reported age as
a prognostic factor for local recurrence of
GCTB and found a correlation between
higher age and lower local recurrence rates.
These findings coincide with those obtained
by Klenke et al.,5 who reported that age was
an independent risk factor for recurrence
regardless of the disease status and chosen
treatment. In the current study, however, we
did not reach the same conclusions regard-
ing the role of these demographic factors.
We consider the present investigation to
be a standardized study in terms of the
following two aspects. First, we enrolled
patients with GCTBs around the knee to
exclude the impact of the tumor site.
Second, the surgical procedures were con-
sistent among all patients.
However, the application of phenol and
the long duration of this prospective study
probably interfered with the investigation
and might be considered confounding fac-
tors. To control for confounding factors, the
impact of the application of phenol on the
prognosis was excluded by the correlation
analysis. Klenke et al.5 reported that local
phenol use did not improve recurrence-free
survival. On the other hand, the local
recurrence rates in the former and latter
years were 43.48% and 40.00%, respect-
ively, with no significant difference.
GCTB is generally known to recur within
2 years28,29; therefore, our follow-up period
was set at >2 years. Of the 22 patients with
recurrence, 19 (86.36%) patients developed
recurrence within 2 years (average, 15.05
months), and the remaining 3 patients
developed recurrence after the 2-year
follow-up (2 developed recurrence in the
fifth year postoperatively, and 1 developed
recurrence in the eighth year). For the
patients without recurrence, the follow-up
duration ranged from 2.0 to 9.5 years
(average, 5.61 years).
This is the first study to evaluate the role
of the MRI features of the tumor border in
predicting local recurrence of GCTB.
However, the study has some limitations.
The main limitation is that although this
single-center study was standardized by
enrolling only patients with GCTB around
the knee, the number of patients with GCTB
was relatively small. To the best of our
knowledge, however, the GCTBs mainly
recurred within 2 years. We cannot exclude
the possibility of long-term recurrence with-
out extending the study duration.
In conclusion, the MRI feature of the
``paintbrush borders'' sign was discovered as
an independent prognostic factor for local
recurrenceofGCTB.Pathologically,penetrat-
ing irregular margins on preoperative MRI
were correlated with bone invasion around the
GCTB. Careful evaluation of the GCTB
border by MRI might help to raise surgeons'
awareness about the risk of penetrating irregu-
lar margins and guide surgical treatment to
ensure thorough elimination of residual
tumors in the region of the protrusions.
