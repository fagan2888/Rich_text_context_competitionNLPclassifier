"Asia's Missing Women" as a Problem in Applied Evolutionary Psychology?

Sciences, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. Email: rob.brooks@unsw.edu.au.
Abstract: In many parts of Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, women and children
are so undervalued, neglected, abused, and so often killed, that sex ratios are now strongly
male biased. In recent decades, sex-biased abortion has exacerbated the problem. In this
article I highlight several important insights from evolutionary biology into both the origin
and the severe societal consequences of "Asia's missing women", paying particular
attention to interactions between evolution, economics and culture. Son preferences and
associated cultural practices like patrilineal inheritance, patrilocality and the Indian Hindu
dowry system arise among the wealthy and powerful elites for reasons consistent with
models of sex-biased parental investment. Those practices then spread via imitation as
technology gets cheaper and economic development allows the middle class to grow
rapidly. I will consider evidence from India, China and elsewhere that grossly male-biased
sex ratios lead to increased crime, violence, local warfare, political instability, drug abuse,
prostitution and trafficking of women. The problem of Asia's missing women presents a
challenge for applied evolutionary psychology to help us understand and ameliorate sex
ratio biases and their most severe consequences.

Introduction
In 1990, economist Amartya Sen argued in the New York Review of Books that
"More than 100 Million Women are Missing" (Sen, 1990). He noted that in many parts of
the world, girls and women are so much more likely to be neglected, abused and even
killed that female life expectancy is much lower than it is for boys and men. As a result, by
his estimate, 100 million women who would have been alive - had males and females
received" roughly similar treatment in matters of life and death" - were dead.
Since 1990, the spread of new technologies has granted progressively easier and
earlier sex-determination of fetuses, paving the way for sex-specific abortion. Pre-
implantation genetic diagnosis and sperm sorting now also make sex selection via In-Vitro

Fertilization possible, raising the prospect of even more efficient son selection in the near
future.
The immense human tragedy of neglect, infanticide and unnecessary abortion
makes Asia's missing women one of the most pressing humanitarian issues of our time. But
that is only half the story. The profoundly male-biased sex ratios leave millions of young
men unable to find a mate or have a family, causing problems of crime, human trafficking
and violence that threaten the cohesion and security of entire regions (Edlund, Li, Yi, and
Zhang, 2007, 2010; Hudson, 2002; Hudson and den Boer, 2004).
In this article I argue that evolutionary theory offers important insights into both the
origins and the consequences of this "missing women" problem. Asia's missing women
are, in economic terms, an aggregate outcome of millions of parenting decisions. The
individual drivers behind those decisions emerge from interactions between our evolved
parenting preferences and social and economic circumstances. Applied evolutionary
psychology must take its place alongside economics and sociology if this complex problem
and its tragic consequences are ever to be mitigated (Brooks, 2011).
Scope of the Problem
Birth sex ratios in societies without sex-biased abortion consistently sit between 105
and 107 (median 105.9) males born per 100 females (Coale, 1991). Globally, across all
ages, this ratio drops to about 101.6 males per 100 females because boys and men generally
experience greater mortality in childhood, adolescence and early adulthood, than girls and
women.
In countries where girls and women enjoy the same health care and food and in
which they are not aborted, killed, or neglected as a consequence of their sex, population
sex ratios vary between even (100) and very slightly female biased (98). But across large
parts of North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia, population sex ratios are
strikingly male-biased. By comparing national sex ratio data with data from countries
where women enjoy more equitable circumstances, it is possible to infer the number of
"missing" women and girls - females who should be alive but are not. Hesketh and Xing
(2006) estimate that between 67 and 92 million females are missing in total from just eight
countries: China (34-41 million), India (27-39 million), Pakistan (2.6-4.9 million),
Bangladesh (1.8-3.7), Iran (0.8-1.2 million), Afghanistan (0.5-1 million), Taiwan (0.4-0.6
million) and South Korea (0.2-0.3 million). In figure 1, I show the sex ratio bias in these
countries relative to the rest of the world, for the most male-biased cohort ­ infants and
children.
Causes of Biased Sex Ratios
Sex biases can arise due to unequal rates of male and female conception, unequal
probabilities of fetuses being carried to term, and unequal age-specific survival rates. At
each of these stages, inequalities can be introduced via parental behavior, but other factors
such as disease also play a role.

Some diseases alter the probability of a woman giving birth to a boy or girl.
Infection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, for example, can cause sex ratios
as dramatic as 260 boys born for every 100 girls (Kankova et al., 2007). And, similarly,
150 boys are born for every 100 girls to mothers with Hepatitis B. The economist Emily
Oster (2005) suggested that Hepatitis B infection rates might explain as much as half of the
"missing women", but she has since admitted that she was wrong about the potential for
Hepatitis B infection rates to explain a large proportion of Asia's missing women, based on
better estimates of the effects of Hepatitis B infection on sex ratios (Oster, Chen, Yu, and
Lin, 2010).
Throughout the region where population sex ratios are so strikingly male biased,
parents express very strong son preferences (Hesketh and Xing, 2006), and the lives of
women and girls are often less valued by both families and communities as a whole than
they are in other parts of the world (Bandyopadhyay, 2003; Hesketh and Xing, 2006).
Son preferences can bias the sex ratio toward males in a number of ways. Most

dramatically, female infants are sometimes killed at birth upon the wishes of the parents or
their family. But the systematic neglect of daughters and women whose families don't feed,
immunize, seek medical attention and care for them as well as they do for brothers and
husbands has long been the main cause of elevated female mortality (Hesketh and Xing,
2006; Jeffery, Jeffery, and Lyon, 1984; Oster, 2009).
In the last three decades, differences in male and female mortality have shrunk in
most of the countries concerned, probably due to improved sanitation and childhood
healthcare (Hesketh and Xing, 2006; Zhu, Lu, and Hesketh, 2009). But in India, China, and
South Korea, these gains have been undone by other losses. Since the advent of
amniocentesis in the mid-1970s and the spread of affordable ultrasound mid-1980s - both
technologies that allowed pre-natal sex testing - sex-specific abortion has become a major
driver of contemporary skews in birth sex ratios (Das Gupta et al., 2003; Hesketh and Xing,
2006; Zhu et al., 2009).
In India, the phenomenon is referred to as "female feticide" in English and khanya
bhronn hatya (literally "the killing of young girls") in Hindi (Goldberg, 2010). Although
abortion is a legal means to ending unwanted pregnancies in India, the law prohibits
abortion for sex selection, mandating up to 10 years imprisonment (Sudha and Irudaya,
1999), but there has never been a successful prosecution (Bandyopadhyay, 2003). Reports
of fetuses aborted at clinics suggest that well over 99 percent of them are female (Goldberg,
2010).
In India and China, sex-biased abortion usually manifests in the second and
subsequent parity after the birth of a daughter (Hesketh and Xing, 2006; Zhu et al., 2009).
Families let nature take its course for the first child, but become less likely to do so at
higher parities. When in the past child-bearing continued until the desired number of sons
had been born, declining fertilities (due to urbanization, the fertility decline phase of the
demographic transition, and, in the Chinese case, the one-child policy) place greater
urgency on selecting the sex of the second and subsequent children.
Evolutionary Theories of Son Preferences
Evolutionary theory can help us understand why son preferences are so strong in
societies like India, China, and South Korea, and how social and economic factors lead
both to the expression of strong son preferences and the under-valuation of girls and
women. Selection has driven the evolution of a deep parental devotion to the safety and
welfare of offspring (Hrdy, 2009). Yet humans are capable of both infanticide and lethal
neglect of their own genetic offspring, and there are a number of adaptive reasons that
could underlie these behaviors (Daly and Wilson, 1988a; Dickemann, 1975, 1979a, 1979b;
Hrdy, 1999, 2009).
Selection usually acts to equalize parental investment in the sexes (Fisher, 1930).
Because every offspring has exactly one father and one mother, the total number of
offspring sired by males always equals the total number borne by females. This is the
Fisher condition, and under most circumstances it mandates that negative frequency
dependent selection will favor any mechanisms that bias parents toward rearing and caring
for the rarer sex, restoring the sex ratio to approximate parity (see Jennions and Kokko,
Asia's missing women
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2012. -914-
2010 for a review).
Even though the population-wide aggregate effect of selection should be for parents
to invest equally in sons and daughters, under some circumstances parental biases toward
bearing or investing in offspring of one sex rather than the other might be adaptive. These
adaptive scenarios fall into three categories: local competition, local resource enhancement,
and the Trivers-Willard effect.
When one sex does not disperse far from their natal range, same-sex relatives can
compete for local resources such as mates, territories or food. Hamilton (1967) first argued
that under these circumstances, selection would favor those parents who invested more in
the dispersing sex and less in the philopatric sex in order to avoid local competition among
relatives. Female parasitoid wasps, for example, lay mostly female (i.e., fertilized) eggs
when they are first to parasitize a host and her sons are likely to compete only among
themselves. But the second and subsequent females that lay on a host increase the number
of male (i.e., unfertilized) eggs they lay (e.g., Werren, 1980).
Local resource enhancement occurs when offspring of the philopatric sex help the
parents to defend their territories and rear offspring, providing fitness returns both through
their own reproduction and by directly enhancing the parents' reproductive success. In
many cooperatively breeding bird species, sons stay in their natal territory and help their
parents breed. Under such circumstances, parents adaptively bias their investments toward
sons (Emlen, Emlen, and Levin, 1986) creating male-biased adult sex ratios.
The third adaptive pathway to sex ratio bias was outlined forty years ago by Bob
Trivers and Dan Willard (1973). They noted that the human practice of hypergyny (women
marrying into families wealthier than their natal families) could make the benefits of
investing in sons and daughters dependent on wealth. The stronger the hypergyny, the more
sexual competition girls from the wealthiest families would face from less wealthy
contemporaries to mate with the few wealthy eligible men. At the other end of the
spectrum, daughters from poor families have more options to marry upward into slightly
wealthier families, whereas their brothers have fewer prospects of starting a family of their
own. Trivers and Willard predicted that wealthy parents that bias conception or the
investments they make in care toward sons, and the poorest families that conceive or invest
more in daughters would enjoy greater fitness returns than similar parents who invested
equally in daughters and sons.
They predicted that in those mammals in which males compete to be among the few
winners who win a harem or territory and thereby enjoy a paternity bonanza, a pregnant
mother's condition might influence the size, strength and thus the fitness prospects of her
sons more than it alters the prospects of her daughters. In such species, mothers in good
condition should produce more sons and invest more in post-natal care (e.g. lactation) when
they have a son than a daughter. This prediction has been verified in a large number of
mammal species (see Cameron, 2004a for review; Wild and West, 2007). The predictions
are also often upheld in studies of humans living in historic (Voland, 1984; Voland and
Dunbar, 1995) societies and in contemporary industrialized (Cameron and Dalerum, 2009)
and subsistence farming (Pollet, Fawcett, Buunk, and Nettle, 2009) societies.

Patrilineal patrilocality
Much of the literature on Asia's missing women considers factors special to each
country. Those circumstances peculiar to each country (e.g. Indian dowries and Chinese
one-child policy) have given each a unique trajectory, but as Das Gupta et al. (2003) argue,
"the striking similarities in patterns of son preference stem from commonalities in the
kinship systems in these [countries]". These shared kinship features are the key to
understanding son preferences, gender inequality, and the observed sex ratio biases. They
do so in ways that are consistent with local resource enhancement and Trivers-Willard
theories for the adaptive biasing of sex ratios.
Das Gupta et al. (2003) argue that Han Chinese, Northern and Northwest Indian,
and South Korean societies, while different, are all among the most rigidly patrilineal
societies in their organization and patrilocal in their spatial structure. In each of these
societies, it is highly unusual for daughters to inherit land. And the patriline is crucial in
important funerary rites in North-west India and in ancestor worship in Korea and China
(Das Gupta et al., 2003).
Patriliny is reinforced by patrilocality, with women leaving both their home and
their lineage to marry, whereupon they are absorbed into their husband's lineage and their
niche in their natal lineage ceases to exist. According to Das Gupta et al. (2003), "Thus it is
that only men constitute the social order, and women are the means whereby men
reproduce themselves".
Patrilocality leaves newlywed women without allies once they move into their
conjugal village - often into a home populated by their husband's parents and brothers. It is
the sons and their wives who support and care for parents in their old age. And women only
ever rise to positions of prestige and prominence as the mothers of sons (Das Gupta et al.,
2003). The mother's power and influence depends on the sons' loyalty to her, over and
above his loyalty to his wife or either's relationship with his unmarried sisters.
"Unfortunately, the successful self-assertion of women in a such a kinship system is at the
expense of younger women, which helps perpetuate the cycle of female subordination"
(Das Gupta et al., 2003).
In general, women in matrilocal societies tend to enjoy greater autonomy, more
power within the home and society, lower levels of violence and spousal abuse, and more
opportunity to do visible work outside the home than women in patrilocal societies (Hrdy,
2009). These differences manifest not only at national levels, but also among ethnic groups,
between regions, and, presumably, among clans, families and individuals. In non-Han
Chinese minorities, for example, where kinship is less rigidly patrilineal, son preferences
are weaker or not detectable (Hua, 2001).
In India, population and especially childhood sex ratios are most dramatically male-
biased in the northern and northwestern regions (Chandramouli, 2011; see Figure 2) and
least male-biased in southern regions (like Kerala), some central states (notably
Chhattisgarh) and the northeast (e.g., Arunachal Pradesh).

In general, North and Northwest India have historically been wheat-based agrarian
economies with higher fertilities and more developed dowry customs than in the central,
northeastern and southern regions (Bandyopadhyay, 2003). Throughout India, a newlywed
couple is more likely to settle near to the man's parents and other relatives, but this
Asia's missing women

patrilocality is much more pronounced in the North and Northwest where the movement of
brides between villages is also less likely to be reciprocal than in the South (Das Gupta et
al.; Hudson and den Boer, 2004). Thus, new brides move a considerable distance into a
village where they know nobody and have no allies, but live close to the groom's parents
and male relatives who prosecute his interests at the expense of hers. In these male-
dominated economies, women are less educated, experience lower status, and are more
often secluded than in the other regions.
In the southern and eastern regions, women generally enjoy more status, better
education, higher literacy and better healthcare as well as more prominent roles in the rice-
based agrarian economy (Bandyopadhyay, 2003; Das Gupta et al.; Hudson and den Boer,
2004). Brides move shorter distances from their natal villages to marry, have more
opportunities to return to their natal villages, and maintain mutually supportive
relationships with their parents. Kerala is also notable for its history of educating girls and
for its matrilineal inheritance system among some castes (Sen, 1990). All of these
differences make for weaker son preferences by reducing the difference in value between a
daughter and a son, and for overall less rigid construction of gender in South Indian kinship
systems (Das Gupta et al., 2003; Hudson and den Boer, 2004).
Extreme patrilineal customs and patrilocal living, when they arise, tend to reinforce
one another and consistently marginalize and devalue women and girls. But can
evolutionary theory reveal any useful insights into how this occurs?
The broad patterns are certainly not consistent with Hamilton's (1967) ideas about
local competition for mates or other resources. The dispersing sex, females, is
discriminated against. Instead, the pattern is consistent with local resource enhancement as
the sex that remains close to the parents is favored and outnumbers the dispersing sex. Sons
also deliver direct benefits to the parents in terms of status, economic support and
legitimacy through funerary and ancestor worship customs. Thus far, we know of no
attempts to measure the economic or fitness benefits of having sons versus daughters
within the framework of Hamilton's (1967) local resource enhancement hypothesis.
Wealth and Urbanization
The strength of son preferences in India is also linked to the intensity of hypergamy
and the relative wealth of parents. Dickemann (1979b) suggested, on the basis of evidence
that early colonial female infanticide was practiced largely by the highest castes and
wealthiest families, that historic son preferences and male-biased sex ratios may have
originated from the kind of wealth- or state-dependent selection first proposed by Trivers
and Willard (1973).
A similar dynamic may be at play in modern India and elsewhere. In addition to the
North/Northwest versus South/East divide, rural Indian sex ratio is less male-biased than in
urban areas (106 versus 108 males per female across the whole population and 109 versus
111 for children younger than six years old -2011 Census data, Chandramouli, 2011). And
wealth significantly predicts the odds of having a son in contemporary India. Both before
and after the spread of ultrasound, the odds of having a son rose with socioeconomic status,
but this effect of wealth has become much stronger in the post-ultrasound period as
Asia's missing women
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2012. -918-
technology made it easier for parents to discriminate by aborting female fetuses
(Subramanian and Selvaraj, 2009).
The importance of wealth and urban living as determinants of Indian sex ratio
biases might be understood simply as urban and wealthy families having the best access to
sex-determination and abortion clinics. Furthermore, both wealth and urbanization depress
fertility, and so the need to have at least one son early on is more pressing in urban and rich
families. On the other hand, one might also expect wealthy and urbanized families to have
more progressive attitudes regarding gender, and for their daughters to have employment
prospects more similar to those of their brothers than daughters of rural and poor families.
The Hindu caste system and associated marriage practices might also contribute to
the higher rates of sex-bias in urban and relatively wealthy families. Making a good
marriage for one's daughter is an important source of social prestige (Rao, 1993; Roulet,
1996). India's Hindu caste system virtually enforces hypergyny, with the mere idea of a
young woman marrying a man of lower sub-caste considered unacceptable (Dickemann,
1979b). It is also desirable, in making a good marriage, to marry into a wealthier family. As
a result of this double-barreled hypergyny, the marriage prospects of girls born into wealthy
and high-caste families are much worse than those of their brothers, because there are
likely to be more eligible women competing to marry sons of families that are wealthier
and from higher sub-castes than their own. The stratification caused by the caste system
reinforces considerable hypergyny within castes.
This strong hypergyny is almost certainly the main engine behind Hindu India's
dowry system. Parents from wealthy and powerful families and castes, especially in the
northwest, have long had to compete via the payment of lavish dowries to marry their
daughters to the sons of higher-born and wealthier families (Dickemann, 1979b; Hudson
and den Boer, 2004). This dynamic placed a strong incentive on wealthy families to raise
sons and avoid raising daughters, which historically led to strong links between caste,
wealth, and poor survival among daughters (Dickemann, 1979b).
When hypergyny intensifies female competition for the wealthiest grooms, then
according to Trivers and Willard's model, the wealthiest families should have
disproportionately more sons. The evidence suggests that this is exactly what happened in
India. Pre-colonial infanticide was most noticeable in the wealthy castes of the northwest,
such as the Rajputs of Rajastan (Dickemann, 1979a, b). Contemporary sex ratios, especially
since abortion replaced neglect as the main process skewing sex ratios, increase steadily
with wealth (Subramanian and Selvaraj, 2009) and with caste. In rural Haryana, the poor
laboring Harijan caste has sex ratios of 102, whereas the land-owning Jats and Yadavs have
strong male biases of 127 (George and Dahiya, 1998).
In the 20th Century, dowry customs spread ­ probably by imitation and the growth
of the middle class - from the high castes of the northwest to other regions and to less
wealthy families and lower castes. While 1961 legislation attempted to limit the spread of
dowries, dowry payments remain a widespread practice and an arena of social prestige
(Patel, 2007; Roulet, 1996). Dowries have also become more materialist in nature and more
financially crippling for the bride's family. Part of the cause for the spread of the dowry
system can be found in India's ballooning middle class of avid status-conscious consumers,
keen to imitate the elites. According to Michelle Goldberg (2010), "in recent years, with
Asia's missing women
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2012. -919-
India suddenly awash in consumerist bounty, dowry demands have exploded, turning the
whole thing into a materialistic free-for-all". Even when there is no negotiated dowry
payment to the groom or his family, lavish weddings, associated gifts and materialistic
shows of status can financially cripple a bride's natal family (Roulet, 1996).
The inflating dowry and wedding customs make the economic cost of raising
daughters ever more extortionate, even when the original scarcity of marriageable men that
gave rise to the dowry custom within the elite castes no longer applies. In doing so, these
customs create strong incentives among a growing segment of the population to abort
female fetuses; reports suggest that clinics sometimes advertise that the financial cost of
terminating a pregnancy today is outweighed by the expense saved on a dowry later on.
It appears likely that Trivers-Willard effects feed into the vicious cycle of
hypergyny, dowries, gender-related violence, and son preference in India. Evidence also
suggests that changing economic circumstances and cultural imitation might mediate the
strength of these effects. The evolutionary and economic factors behind this cultural
imitation, as well as the consequences for sex-selection and the potential to reverse current
harmful sex-selection practices, remain to be formally explored.
Dickemann (1979b) also argued that strong hypergamy and dowries led to the well-
documented infanticide of pre-20th Century China, as well as infanticide, infant
abandonment, and female claustration (e.g. in nunneries) in late mediaeval and early
modern Europe. Independent support for a similar Trivers-Willard dynamic with society-
wide consequences comes from Boone's (1986) analysis of inheritance and reproduction in
15th and 16th Century Portuguese nobility, in which patriarchal family structure and
inheritance arises from the wealthiest elite parents investing preferentially in sons.
Fixing the Problem
The problem of Asia's missing women appears to be a complex aggregate outcome
of several individual and family-level behaviors. These behaviors emerge from interactions
between economic circumstances, cultural traditions and values, and evolved parenting
biases and mating preferences. I have only touched lightly here on some of the areas where
evolutionary biology impinges on this complex tragedy.
Both the local resource enhancement and Trivers-Willard theories of sex ratio bias
are consistent with the observed patterns of son preference and gender discrimination,
especially under the strong patrilineal and patrilocal customs throughout the afflicted parts
of Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. Evolved son preferences may contribute to the
strength of patriliny and patrilocality, which may in turn reinforce the strength of son
preferences in a positive feedback loop.
Complex problems of this nature do not yield to exclusively evolutionary thinking.
Instead, the unique predictions from evolutionary theories (like local resource enhancement
and Trivers-Willard) will need to be integrated with economic and socio-cultural theories
and tools; this is no time to be shoring up outdated "last wall" (sensu Pinker, 2002)
dichotomies between evolution and culture, nature and nurture, or genes and social
environment.
There are many good reasons for trying to break the self-reinforcing evolutionary-
Asia's missing women
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2012. -920-
economic-cultural cycle responsible for Asia's missing women: reducing the suffering
caused by neglect and infanticide, eliminating the parental grief associated with
unnecessary terminations or infanticide, and as we shall shortly see, ameliorating the
society-wide problems caused by excess men. But a problem of this scale requires social
and cultural change on a continent-wide scale, which, even with appropriate political will,
presents an immense challenge.
Here are some brief recommendations informed by the evolutionary ideas I have
mentioned here. In many cases one doesn't need to be an evolutionary scientist to
understand the positive effects they will have. The root causes of patriliny and patrilocality
and the massive discrimination against women and girls that they engender in India, China
and Korea will need to be challenged in order to make any serious progress.
1. Raise the economic value and prospects of women by subsidizing female
education and promoting the role of women in society. Daughters and wives who earn good
salaries are valued by their natal and marital families, and have more to aspire to than being
the mothers of sons. This must happen society-wide, not just in higher castes or wealthier
groups.
2. Change and enforce laws on property ownership and inheritance that discriminate
against wives, daughters and granddaughters.
3. Challenge, where possible, burial and worship customs that require the agency of
sons or male relatives.
4. Educate society to warn of the dangers of male-biased sex ratios, the shortage of
brides and the consequences of hypergyny.
5. Reduce the dependence of aging parents on sons by building retirement savings
and old age support, and by making it easier for daughters to support parents equally.
6. Strictly enforce laws forbidding sex selective abortion and IVF-based sex
selection. Governments should be careful, however, not to simply raise the cost of sex
selection technology or to allow loopholes that elites can use to choose sons, as it is the
very richest and most powerful people that have the greatest evolutionary incentives to
prefer boys, and who are most imitated by the middle class.
7. In India, there is a more pressing need than ever to strictly enforce the ban on
dowries or dowry-like payments across society, reducing the economic burden of having
daughters as well as the incentive for the wealthiest and most powerful families to raise the
intensity of hypergyny.
8. In China, there needs to be recognition that the one-child policy has had a
perverse effect on sex ratios. In particular, the rules allowing families with one or two
daughters to have another child might improve the lot of those daughters but they probably
worsen sex ratios in general. The government might find that improving the education and
empowerment of women might have the dual effect of reducing fertility and improving the
sex ratio.
The Korean Example
Evidence from South Korea supports the case for several of these recommendations.
South Korea was the first country in which access to sex-testing and abortion skewed sex
Asia's missing women
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2012. -921-
ratios dramatically, reaching 116 (Hesketh and Xing, 2006). But several recent changes
have effected a dramatic reversal such that by 2007, the birth sex ratio had returned to 107.
These changes included a strictly-enforced 1987 government ban on sex-selective abortion
(Kim, 2004), greater education and workforce participation for women, parents
accumulating significant savings for old age (Ganatra, 2008; Guilmoto, 2007),
improvements in the legal status of women (greater autonomy, recognizing their property
rights, rights to head their own households), and the `Love your Daughter' public
awareness campaign warning of the dangers of biased sex ratios and the shortage of women
(Chung and Das Gupta, 2007; Hesketh and Xing, 2006).
Consequences of Male-Biased Sex Ratios
When sex ratios become dramatically male-biased, large numbers of men have little
or no prospect of finding a mate and starting a family of their own (Hudson and den Boer,
2004). In India, South Korea, and China, marriage and having children are considered
essential steps toward status and acceptance as a full member of society (Hesketh and Xing,
2006). In China, male-biased sex ratios constrain so many men from ever taking this step
that these men are called "bare branches" ­ limbs of the family tree that will never bear
fruit (Hudson and den Boer, 2004).
"Bare branches" are seldom the offspring of the wealthy and powerful families who
contribute the most to the problem, but rather the offspring of the poorest peasant families.
This has a number of negative consequences for the society as a whole and for those
unlucky men in particular. It also highlights the fact that the decisions made by a family to
terminate a female fetus or kill a newborn daughter create a massive externality, impacting
poorer families far more profoundly than their own (Brooks, 2011).
Several times in Chinese history, female infanticide and neglect created large
surpluses of males. These men drifted into criminal gangs that terrorized other citizens;
sometimes, these men formed larger militias that wreaked large-scale havoc. The Nien
rebellion in 19th Century China was one such event that resulted in the death of 100 000
troops and civilians over a 15-year period; the rebellion devastated the economy and
eventually contributed to the demise of the Qing dynasty (Hudson and den Boer, 2004).
Although spectacular sex-ratio biases on the scale of Asia's missing women are
relatively rare, polygynous traditional societies are more likely to experience between-
group and within-group violence because poor young men have little prospect of finding a
single wife (Ember, 1974; Ember et al., 2007). Similarly, the renowned lawlessness of the
early American West is often attributed to strongly male-biased sex ratios (Courtwright,
1996). The intense jockeying by young men for status, respect and economic success that
so often spills over into violence and, occasionally, homicide (see Daly and Wilson, 1988b)
is made all the more intense by the fact that the prospect of never finding a mate is higher
in polygynous and, by extension, male-biased societies.
In a similar vein, in late medieval and early modern Europe, elite titled and landed
families proliferated beyond the number of titles and area of land available. The younger
sons of these families, jockeying for status and titles, regularly threatened the political
stability of their societies, becoming the "spearhead of feudal aggression" (Duby, 1977).

Expansionist campaigns, from the Crusades (Duby, 1977) to colonialism (Boone III, 1986),
were driven, at least in part, by this surplus of ambitious and aggressive younger sons with
otherwise poor reproductive prospects.
Male-biased sex ratios trigger the phenotypically plastic hyper-competitive
masculine traits that allow young men - especially poor and low-status young men - to
compete furiously for status and wealth in order to win a mate. They also appear to be
triggering related behaviors: risk-taking, violence, gambling, alcohol and drug abuse,
kidnapping and trafficking of women, and the use and abuse of prostitutes. All of these
maladies are on the steep rise in India, China and elsewhere where sex ratios are male-
biased (Edlund et al., 2007, 2008; Hudson, 2002; Hudson and den Boer, 2004).
Not only can we trace the causes of Asia's missing women to interactions between
evolution, economics and culture, but the direst consequences are also evolutionary in
origin. Even if childhood sex ratio biases can be eliminated, societies with skewed sex
ratios will continue to experience high rates of violence and crime for at least one
generation. Those disaffected gangs of young men also make perfect fodder for
fundamentalism and violence of a more global nature. An important future challenge for
applied evolutionary psychology will be to recognize and ameliorate the frustrations and
challenges created by male-biased sex ratios.
