ABSTRACT
Higher levels of albuminuria associate with increased risk for adverse outcomes independent of esti-
mated GFR (eGFR), but whether albuminuria also associates with concurrent complications specific to
chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown. Here, we assessed the association of spot albumin-to-
creatinine ratio with anemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperparathyroidism, and
hypertension among 30,528 adult participants in NHANES 1988­1994 and 1999­2006. After multivari-
able adjustment including eGFR, higher albumin-to-creatinine ratios associated with anemia, acidosis,
hypoalbuminemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hypertension but only weakly associated with acidosis and
anemia. Furthermore, the associations between albumin-to-creatinine ratio and both anemia and acido-
sis were not consistent across eGFR strata. Higher albumin-to-creatinine ratio levels did not associate
with hyperphosphatemia. Lower eGFR associated with higher prevalence ratios for all complications, and
these associations were stronger than those observed for the albumin-to-creatinine ratio; after multi-
variable adjustment, however, the associations between eGFR and both hypoalbuminemia and hyper-
tension were NS. In conclusion, albuminuria and eGFR differentially associate with complications of CKD.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide ma-
jor public health problem with an increasing prev-
alence of kidney failure and poor outcomes.1 It is
estimated that 11.5% of U.S. adults have CKD,2 and
multiple studies have demonstrated its relationship
to an increased risk for mortality, cardiovascular
disease, and kidney failure.3­5
CKD is defined by the presence of reduced esti-
mated GFR (eGFR) or markers of kidney damage,
generally determined by elevated albuminuria, and
it is staged for severity primarily by level of eGFR.6,7
Recent data have demonstrated that albuminuria is
a strong and independent predictor of risk for mor-
tality, cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal dis-
ease, acute kidney injury, and CKD progression,
and it has been suggested that incorporation of al-
buminuria into the CKD staging system will facili-
tate clinical decision making regarding patients'
prognosis.8­12 However, there is little data on
whether albuminuria is also associated with con-
current complications of CKD, which is also rele-
vant for physicians' decisions regarding evaluation
and management at a particular patient encounter.
Data from the U.S.-based National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) have
been used to document the prevalence of CKD
complications by level of eGFR in the general
population.7,13­15 Similar published data on the
relation between albuminuria and CKD compli-

cations are limited. We pooled data from the NHANES III,
conducted in 1988­1994, and NHANES 1999­2006 to de-
termine the relationship between level of albuminuria and
six conditions considered to be complications of CKD: ane-
mia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia, hy-
perparathyroidism, and hypertension. The association of
albuminuria and eGFR with these complications was evalu-
ated separately and in combination.
RESULTS
The majority of the population had albumin-to-creatinine ra-
tio (ACR) 10 mg/g (72.2%), and 18.2%, 7.5%, and 2.1% of
the population had ACR of 10 to 29, 30 to 299, and 300 mg/g,
respectively (Table 1). Similarly, most people had eGFR 60
ml/min per 1.73 m2, with only 3.9%, 1.3%, and 0.3% of the
population having eGFR levels of 45 to 59, 30 to 44, and 30
ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively (Supplemental Table 1).
Those with higher levels of ACR and lower eGFR were older,
were more likely to be non-Hispanic black, had a higher body
mass index, and had diabetes mellitus (Table 1 and Supple-
mental Table 1). Additionally, eGFR levels 90 ml/min per
1.73 m2 were more common at higher ACR levels.
Higher levels of ACR were associated with anemia, acidosis,
hypoalbuminemia, and hyperparathyroidism but not hyper-
phosphatemia (Figure 1). For hypertension, the prevalence ra-
tio increased progressively through approximately ACR of 100
mg/g and thereafter remained stable. For acidosis, there was an
increase in the prevalence ratio at approximately ACR of 30
mg/g. Table 2 shows the prevalence and adjusted prevalence
ratios for the six complications by level of ACR. At ACR levels
10 mg/g, 10% of the population had anemia, acidosis, hy-
perphosphatemia, or hyperparathyroidism whereas 20.3% of
the population had hypertension. The prevalence of anemia,
acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hyper-
tension was higher with higher ACR, whereas the prevalence of
hyperphosphatemia was not. Overall, 13.5%, 16.0%, 10.6%,

28.9%, and 55.5% of those with ACR 300 mg/g had anemia,
acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hyper-
tension, respectively. After multivariable adjustment, there
was a graded association between higher levels of ACR and
higher prevalence ratios for anemia, acidosis, hypoalbumine-
mia, and hyperparathyroidism, but there was a substantial at-
tenuation of the relationship between ACR and hypertension,
such that the prevalence ratios were similar for all ACR levels
10 mg/g (Table 2). There appeared to be a threshold for
hypoalbuminemia with a large increase in the prevalence ratio
at ACR 300 mg/g compared with ACR of 30 to 299 mg/g.
These results were similar in sensitivity analyses, where we
modeled urine albumin concentration instead of ACR.
There was an increase in the prevalence of anemia, acidosis,
hyperphosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperparathy-
roidism with decreasing levels of eGFR, with the increase in
prevalence beginning at approximately eGFR of 60 ml/min per
1.73 m2 for acidosis and hyperphosphatemia and at eGFR of 90
ml/min per 1.73 m2 for the remaining three complications.
Other than for hypertension, there was also an increase in the
prevalence ratio at eGFR levels 120 ml/min per 1.73 m2, with
the most pronounced effects for anemia, hypoalbuminemia,
and hyperparathyroidism (Figure 2). Table 3 shows the prev-
alence and prevalence ratios for complications by level of
eGFR. In contrast to albuminuria, there was a significantly
higher prevalence of each complication at lower eGFR. Other
than hypertension, 10% of the population with eGFR  90
ml/min per 1.73 m2 had any complication, whereas for those
with eGFR 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 the prevalence of anemia,
hyperphosphatemia, acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, hyperpara-
thyroidism, and hypertension was 51.5%, 31.5%, 23.0%, 7.5%,
72.5%, and 82.1%, respectively. After age and multivariable
adjustment, an association remained between lower eGFR lev-
els and higher prevalence ratios for anemia, acidosis, hyper-
phosphatemia, and hyperparathyroidism, but not for hy-
poalbuminemia or hypertension (Table 3).
Instratifiedanalyses,theassociationbetweenACRandanemia
and acidosis was present for certain eGFR strata (40 to 59 and
120 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for anemia and 90 to 119 ml/min per
1.73 m2 for acidosis, P values for the interaction of 0.001 and
0.036, respectively), whereas the association between ACR and
hypoalbuminemia and hypertension was significant for multiple
eGFR strata (P values for the interaction of 0.059 and 0.075, re-
spectively; Table 4 with the number of participants in each
ACR/eGFR stratum provided in Supplemental Table 2).
Higher ACR was not associated with an increased age-, race/
ethnicity-, and sex-adjusted prevalence for hyperphos-
phatemia within any eGFR strata. Indeed, for eGFR levels 30
to 89 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the prevalence of hyperphos-
phatemia was lower at higher ACR categories. Within most
ACR strata, the adjusted prevalence of anemia, acidosis, hy-
perphosphatemia, and hypertension was higher at lower
levels of eGFR.

DISCUSSION
GFR is traditionally considered the best marker for the overall
function of the kidney and is therefore used to classify CKD
into stages. Recent publications have emphasized the role of
albuminuria, a marker of kidney damage to the glomerular
permselectivity barrier, in predicting outcomes.8­12,16 Clinical
encounters also focus on detection, evaluation, and manage-
ment of current conditions, as well as future risk of outcomes,
and there are fewer data available on the association between
ACR and concurrent complications of CKD. The present anal-
ysis of a general population sample of U.S. adults showed a
minimal association between higher levels of ACR and an in-
creased prevalence of anemia, hypoalbuminemia, acidosis, hy-
pertension, and hyperparathyroidism, and no association with
hyperphosphatemia. In contrast, lower eGFR was strongly as-
sociated with all six of these complications, although hyperten-
sion and hypoalbuminemia were attenuated after adjustment
for demographic factors and comorbid conditions. These find-
ings have implications for clinical practice, research, and the
classification of CKD.
Several studies have previously documented the strong as-
sociation of GFR to complications of CKD.7,14,15,17­19 Consis-
tent with these prior studies, in the current analysis, a strong
relationship was observed between lower eGFR and a higher
prevalence for all six concurrent complications. Associations
remained strong for anemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia,
and hyperparathyroidism, even after adjustment for demo-
graphic factors, cigarette smoking, body mass index, diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, and ACR. Associations with hyperten-
sion were substantially attenuated after adjustment for age,
which is likely secondary to the increasing prevalence of hyper-
tension with older age regardless of level of eGFR. Although
associations with hypoalbuminemia were nonlinear at the low-
est levels of eGFR, this may be secondary to small numbers of
people with hypoalbuminemia and severe reductions in eGFR.
For hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hyperten-
sion, a significant association was observed at eGFR levels as
high as 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2, whereas the significant associ-
ation for anemia and acidosis started at eGFR of 60 ml/min per
1.73 m2. A higher prevalence of complications was observed at
eGFR 120 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for all complications, other
than hypertension.
A graded relationship between ACR and anemia, acidosis,
hypoalbuminemia, and hyperparathyroidism was observed.
Compared with ACR 10 mg/g, people with ACR 300 mg/g
had 2.4-, 1.5-, 7.1-, and 2.9-fold increases in the age-adjusted
prevalence ratio for anemia, acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, and
hyperparathyroidism, respectively. The prevalence of anemia
and hyperparathyroidism began to increase at levels of ACR of
10 to 29 mg/g and between 30 and 299 mg/g for acidosis and
hypoalbuminemia, and these associations were robust to ad-
justment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, eGFR, cigarette smoking,
diabetes, hypertension, and body mass index. Nevertheless, the

overall association between ACR and acidosis was weak and,
for both acidosis and anemia, the association was not consis-
tently present within different strata of eGFR. For all compli-
cations, the associations were not as strong as was observed for
eGFR. No association was present between higher ACR levels
and the prevalence of hyperphosphatemia, and even in the
analysis stratified by eGFR and ACR, the association was NS.
As with eGFR, the relationship with hypertension was substan-
tially attenuated after adjustment, again likely demonstrating
the collinearity with age. Little data is available on ACR and
each of these complications in the general population. How-

strated that there is a relationship between higher levels of pro-
teinuria and lower hemoglobin levels.20,21
Recently, there have been several publications that have
demonstrated a strong association between albuminuria and
proteinuria with long-term clinical outcomes. These associa-
tions are independent of eGFR, consistent across outcomes,
and comparable in magnitude to the excess risk associated with
lower eGFR.8­12,16 Taken together, data from multiple sources
now demonstrate that albuminuria is a strong risk factor for
long-term outcomes and is moderately associated with some
but not all complications of CKD. These divergent findings
likely reflect the relationship of concurrent complications with
different functions of the kidney, the heterogeneous nature of
CKD, and other nonrenal causes for these abnormalities. One
possible explanation is that excretions of both hydrogen ions
and phosphate are specifically regulated by the renal tubule
and that these excretory functions are more closely related to
GFR. A second possible explanation is that albuminuria may
reflect systemic disorders that result in inflammation and gen-
eralized endothelial damage, and that anemia, hypertension,
and hyperparathyroidism are secondary to these systemic dis-
orders as well as decreased GFR. This is more expected with
anemia and hypertension than with hyperparathyroidism, but
there is some preliminary supporting evidence for this hypoth-
esis. Prior studies have described the association of low vitamin
D levels to higher C-reactive protein.22 Treatment with vitamin
D in animal studies and humans has decreased albumin-
uria.23­25 Hypoalbuminemia may relate in part to urinary pro-
tein loss, or to malnutrition, but may also be related to systemic
inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.
In many prior analyses, a J-shaped relationship has been
observed between eGFR and long-term and concurrent com-
plications of CKD, reflecting low creatinine generation and
overestimation of measured GFR in people with muscle wast-
ing.3,26 In the current analyses, the J-shaped relationship was
observed with all complications other than hypertension but
was most pronounced with anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and
hyperparathyroidism. Lower levels of hemoglobin, bicarbon-
ate, and serum albumin at higher eGFR levels have been ob-
served previously. However, most prior analyses have focused
on hyperparathyroidism at lower levels of GFR, and it has not
been reported at higher eGFR levels.13­14,27 Presumably, the
J-shaped relationship identifies a group of people with chronic
disease leading to muscle wasting. If anemia, hypoalbumine-
mia, and hyperparathyroidism do reflect systemic disease, as
was hypothesized above, then this may provide a possible ex-
planation as to why these conditions were most strongly asso-
ciated with the J-shaped curve.
Currently, there are proposals to include albuminuria in the
staging system for CKD given its predictive power for the oc-
currence of long-term outcomes.28 These proposals assume
that its inclusion will facilitate patient care. For long-term out-
comes, the strong associations may mean that knowing a pa-
tient's albuminuria level will help clinicians develop prognoses
for patients, and as such may possibly facilitate decisions re-
garding treatment. More studies are required before specific
strategies can be implemented. In the current study, ACR was
associated with only some of the complications that were eval-
uated, and apart from hypoalbuminemia, the prevalence of
complications at higher levels of ACR among individuals with
eGFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was low. As such, ACR does not
appear to contribute much additional information for identi-
fication of patients who should be tested for most CKD com-
plications or who may require specialized care for these com-
plications. Recommendations for the evaluation and
management of decreased GFR and elevated albuminuria
should differ depending upon the specific outcome and com-
plication in question.
Strengths of the analysis include a large ethnically diverse
representative sample, measurement of multiple CKD compli-
cations, and rigorously collected data using standardized pro-
tocols and laboratory procedures. In addition, there are several
limitations of this analysis. First, we evaluated only selected
complications. Nevertheless, we purposely selected complica-
tions that reflect different biologic processes. Second, ACR was
used to assess albuminuria and, consistent with most large ep-
idemiology studies, a 24-hour urine collection was not feasible.
Only a single ACR measurement was available. It is estimated
that approximately 50% of individuals with ACR 30 mg/g on
a single measurement will not have persistent albuminuria.29
Furthermore, the ACR may be high due to extremely low levels
of creatinine as well as high levels of albuminuria; however,
results were consistent when considering urinary albumin
concentration rather than ACR. Third, different assays were
used across the NHANES for some biochemical measures (e.g.,
bicarbonate). Fourth, despite a large sample size, there were
some cells with small numbers. In particular, there were few
people with lower levels of eGFR and higher albuminuria lev-
els. Hypoalbuminemia is uncommon and associations for this
complication had wide confidence intervals, and the patterns
observed may be secondary to these small numbers. Fifth, im-
munoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was only available
on a subset of participants, and we were not able to perform an
analysis stratified by ACR and eGFR for this complication. Fi-
nally, although we adjusted for C-reactive protein, we are not
able to state with certainty that associations between albumin-
uria or eGFR with concurrent complications are mediated by
inflammation because only a low-sensitivity C-reactive protein
assay was available in NHANES III.
In conclusion, ACR was significantly associated with ane-
mia, acidosis hypoalbuminemia, hyperparathyroidism, and
hypertension but not with hyperphosphatemia. However, the
associations for anemia and acidosis were not consistent
within eGFR strata, and relationships were substantially
weaker than those observed between eGFR and these same
complications. Revisions to the CKD classification system
should consider implications for all aspects of the clinical ac-
tion plan including these complications.

CONCISE METHODS
Study Population
The NHANES are cross-sectional, multistage, stratified, clustered
probability samples of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized popula-
tion conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. The
NHANES cycles included in the current analysis were conducted from
1988 through 1994 in two phases (1988­1991 and 1991­1994) and
from 1999 through 2006 in four phases (1999­2000, 2001­2002,
2003­2004, and 2005­2006).30 The total number of adults enrolled
included in these six phases was 39,136. The study population was
limited to participants who completed a medical evaluation in the
NHANES mobile examination center and were aged 20 years or older.
Those who were pregnant or were missing measurements of urinary
albumin or creatinine excretion, serum creatinine, phosphorous, he-
moglobin, bicarbonate, serum albumin, or BP, or who had eGFR 15
ml/min per 1.73 m2 were excluded from the current analyses. After
these exclusions, data for 30,528 participants were available for the
analyses of anemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia,
and hypertension. Data were available for 8,242 NHANES 2003­2004
and 2005­2006 participants for the analysis of iPTH.
Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and cigarette smoking were self-reported.
Height and weight were measured, and body mass index was calcu-
lated. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a self-report of a previous
diagnosis, not during pregnancy, with concurrent use of insulin or
oral hypoglycemic medication or a glucose 126 mg/dl among par-
ticipants who fasted 9 hours before their study visit or 200 mg/dl
among nonfasting participants.
Measures of Kidney Function
Serum creatinine was recalibrated to standardized creatinine mea-
surements obtained at the Cleveland Clinic Research Laboratory.31
eGFR was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
Collaboration equation.2 eGFR categories included 120, 90 to 119,
60 to 89, 45 to 59, 30 to 44, and 15 to 29 ml/min per 1.73 m2.28 Urine
albumin and creatinine concentrations were obtained from a random
spot urine sample from participants examined at the mobile exami-
nation center using a clean-catch technique and sterile containers.
Urinary ACR was computed and is reported in milligrams per gram
(mg/g; 1 mg/g  0.131 mg/mmol). Albuminuria categories included
normal, high-normal, high, and very high defined as ACR 10, 10 to
29, 30 to 299, and 300 mg/g, respectively. In a sensitivity analysis, we
repeated the analyses using urine albumin instead of ACR, with cate-
gories of 12, 12 to 31, 32 to 99, and 100 mg/dl.
Assessment of CKD Complications
Complications that reflect different biologic mechanisms were in-
cluded. Anemia was defined by the World Health Organization
as hemoglobin levels 12 g/dl for women and 13.5 g/dl for men.
Acidosis was defined as serum bicarbonate 21 mEq/L. Hyperphos-
phatemia was defined as serum phosphate 4.5 mg/dl. Hypoalbu-
minemia was defined as serum albumin 3.5 g/dl. Hyperpara-
thyroidism was defined as iPTH levels 70 pg/ml. To standardize the
laboratory values across all surveys, the age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-
adjusted difference in the mean level for hemoglobin, bicarbonate,
phosphate, serum albumin, and iPTH for participants 20 to 39 years
old without diabetes and hypertension, with eGFR 60 ml/min per
1.73 m2, and with ACR 10 for each survey was calculated. Differ-
ences from the value for NHANES 2005­2006 was then added/sub-
tracted for values for the other NHANES phases. BP was measured six
times in NHANES III and three times in NHANES 1999­2006. With
use of the average of all available BP measurements, hypertension was
defined as a systolic BP 140 mmHg, diastolic BP 90 mmHg, or
self-reported use of antihypertensive medication.
Statistical Analysis
The unadjusted prevalence ratios for each CKD complication associ-
ated with ACR and eGFR, modeled separately as continuous variables,
were calculated using restricted quadratic splines with knots at ACR
levels of 10, 30, 100, and 300 mg/g and eGFR levels of 30, 60, 90, and
120 ml/min per 1.73 m2. ACR was log-transformed for the spline
analyses. Prevalence ratios are recommended for use in cross-sec-
tional studies with common outcomes32; therefore, with ACR 10
mg/g as the reference group, log-linear generalized estimating equa-
tions were used to calculate the prevalence ratios for anemia, acidosis,
hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, hypoalbuminemia, and
hypertension associated with higher levels of ACR. Prevalence ratios
were adjusted initially for age and NHANES phase and subsequently
for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and eGFR (or ACR for the associations of
eGFR with complications), and NHANES phase. A final model in-
cluded additional adjustment for cigarette smoking, body mass index,
diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, except in the final model with
hypertension as the outcome that included cigarette smoking, body
mass index, and diabetes mellitus. The prevalence ratios for these
complications associated with eGFR categories, with levels of 90 to
119 ml/min per 1.73 m2 as the referent, were also calculated. In sen-
sitivity analyses, we modeled urine albumin instead of ACR, with
categories of 12, 12 to 31, 32 to 99, and 100 mg/dl.
The age-, race/ethnicity-, and sex-adjusted prevalence of anemia,
acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hypertension
were calculated by the cross-categorization of ACR and eGFR. The
prevalence estimates were adjusted to age 60 years and to a sex-race
distribution similar to the U.S. population (50% women, 75% non-
Hispanic white, 10% non-Hispanic black, 10% Hispanic, and 5%
other race/ethnicity). The number of participants with iPTH levels
was not sufficient to achieve reliable estimates for the cross-categori-
zation analysis.
Analyses were performed incorporating the sampling weights to
obtain unbiased estimates using SUDAAN version 10 (Research Tri-
angle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Sampling weights were
combined across all survey phases from NHANES 1988­2006.
