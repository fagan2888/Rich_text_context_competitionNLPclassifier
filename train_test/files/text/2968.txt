Data from a National SuNey

JOHN E. ANDERSON, PHD, LYLE McCORMICK, MSW, AND RONALD FICHTNER, PHO



  Background and Objectives: STD prevention programs need to identify population subgroups and risk behaviors that are associated with higher rates of disease.
  Goal of the Study: To sec what levels of STD experience were reported by respondents to a national survey and what factors were associated with self-reported STDs.

Study Design: The survey data are from Cycle IV (1988) of	 	
the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), a nationally representative household-based sample of 8450 women ages 15

to 44 years. We examined characteristics of survey respondents who reported STD experience, characteristics of STD cases re­ ported to the national STD surveillance system, and factors related to self-reported STDs using multiple logistic regression. Results: The self-reported survey data indicate that the ma­ jority of respondents who ever had gonorrhea (55%) were white, but white women account for only 19% of the annual cases in the surveillance system. Logistic regression analysis of survey data indicates factors associated with reported gonorrhea ex­ perience, sexual behavior, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic back­ ground, perceived risk of AIDS, receiving birth control education, and region of residence. Reporting of chlamydia ap­
pears to be strongly related to knowledge of this infection.
  Conclusions: Because of basic differences in the statistics be­ ing compared, we cannot rule out other explanations. Our results suggest that the surveillance data may reflect underreporting of higher socioeconomic groups making use of private health care. Survey data, on the other hand, are probably affected by underreporting of STD experience. Questions to measure STD experience, treatment, and source of care on surveys of this type would greatly increase the understanding of STDs in the national population.


SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE (STD) preven­
tion programs need to identify population subgroups and risk behaviors that are associated with higher rates of disease. However, much of what is known about STDs has been learned from data reported to surveillance sys­ tems or from studies of clinic populations-sources that

may not represent the entire population. Another source of STD data is population-based sample surveys. Such surveys have the advantage of producing estimates that represent the general population, but may have the dis­ advantage of measurement errors related to self-reporting of diseases. Though the limitations of population-based surveys must be recognized, these surveys can give us another vantage point from which to view STDs. Taken in conjunction with more traditional clinic and surveil­ lance STD data, data from these surveys can help us to better understand the extent and correlates of STDs in a population.
  To examine the usefulness of population survey data on STDs, we analyzed data from a national reproductive health survey in the US that asked respondents about their STD experience. We looked at these survey data to see what levels of STD experience were reported by re­ spondents and to see what factors were associated with self-reported STDs. We examined the characteristics of survey respondents who reported STD experience and the characteristics of STD cases reported to the national STD surveillance system. Because of differences in measurement between these two systems, comparisons between them are necessarily indirect. Finally, we at­ tempted to develop recommendations for STD preven­ tion programs from our results, and to make suggestions regarding collection of more accurate data.

Data
  The survey data are from Cycle IV of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), which is conducted periodically by the National Center for Health Statistics. This was a reproductive health survey conducted in

1988 with a nationally representative household-based sample of women aged 15 to 44 years.1•2 The NSFG sam­ ple was selected using probability methods from 156 sampling areas located throughout the United States. This sample was designed to produce national estimates of numbers and percentages of women with charac­ teristics measured by the survey. Respondents were in­ terviewed in person in their homes. A total of 8,450 women were interviewed: 5,354 white, 2,771 black, and 325 of other races. The overall response rate was 79%. Black women were sampled at a higher rate than other women to increase the reliability of estimates for this group. Weighting factors were used that compensated for these unequal selection probabilities and for nonre­ sponse using standard survey research methods. Esti­ mates made using the weighting factors were designed to be unbiased estimates of the noninstitutionalized US population of women aged 15 to 44 years.3
  A wide variety of reproductive-related information was collected on the NSFG, including pregnancy histo­ ries, contraceptive use, and use of medical care. Re­ spondents were asked a series of questions about four sexually transmitted diseases: gonorrhea, genital herpes, genital warts, and chlamydia. Respondents were not asked about syphilis. The form of the questions was, for example, "Has a doctor ever told you that you have gonorrhea?"
  The surveillance data that we examined were taken from the 1990 annual incidence data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These data are reported by state and local STD control programs in the US and are reported and tabulated by CDC.4

Methods
  All percentages that we report from the NSFG are weighted. We have estimated the percentage of women reporting STD experience for the entire population, and for subgroups. In examining differences in self-reported. STDs among subgroups, we used one-way analysis of variance to assess statistical significance. We then used multiple logistic regression analysis to see which vari­ ables were associated with reported disease, while other variables were controlled statistically. The regression models were reduced using stepwise methods to include only those variables that had a significance  level of .05 or less.
  The variables initially considered were marital status, race, age, religion, education, condom use at last inter­ course, poverty level, employment status, metropolitan residence, region of residence, number of sex partners (lifetime and in the past 3 months), whether the respon­ dent had received formal STD and contraceptive educa­ tion before the age of 18, whether the respondent had

been to a doctor for family planning in the past year, attendance at a public family planning clinic in the past year, desire for more births, planning status of  births, age at first intercourse, and degree of knowledge about AIDS. The computation of confidence intervals and re­ gression analysis is based on methods that account for the complex sample design.5 The final models were evaluated for goodness of fit using the Hosmer­ Lemeshow chi-square, which was not significant, indi­ cating adequate goodness of fit.6
  To examine surveillance data in conjunction with the survey data, we restricted our attention to females aged 15 to 44. The only disease for which we could look at both survey and surveillance data was gonorrhea. The measurements available from the surveillance and sur­ vey data are somewhat different; surveillance data are for incidence of cases in the past year, whereas the sur­ vey data are for the number ever reporting they had gonorrhea. Finally, the only variable available for both surveillance and survey data is race/ethnic group.

Results

Gonorrhea Reported in Survey and Surveillance System
   The survey data indicate that in 1988 just more than one million women had ever had gonorrhea  (Table 1).  In 1990, 250 thousand cases were reported to the sur­ veillance system. In each of the race/ethnic categories, the number reporting ever having the disease  was greater than the annual number of cases. This difference is smaller for black women than for other race/ethnic groups-192,000 annual cases reported compared with 338,000 estimated ever having the disease (95% confi­ dence interval of 240,000 to 436,000).
  When we compare the percentage distribution by race/ethnic group (Table 1), the survey indicates that the majority of respondents who have ever had gonorrhea (55%) were white, although white women make up only 19% of annual cases in the surveillance system. Simi­ larly, for Hispanics the survey showed 9.2%,  whereas the surveillance data showed 3.1%. This difference is accounted for by black women, who make up 76.9% of the surveillance cases, but only 31.9% of the survey re­ spondents reporting gonorrhea.

Survey Data
  Rates of reporting for the four STDs are shown in Table 2. The most frequently reported STD was genital warts (3.6%). Chlamydia, which is believed to have the largest incidence among these infections,7 has the low­ est self-reported rate (1.7%). This appears to be related to the fact that some diseases are better known in the

population than others. During the survey, respondents were asked whether they knew about two of the STDs: genital herpes and chlamydia. (There  were  no questions on knowledge of gonorrhea or genital warts.) The ques­ tion asked was, for example, "Have you ever heard of genital herpes?"
  A much higher percentage of respondents knew of herpes (88.4%)  than  chlamydia  (36.6%)  (Table  2). When attention is restricted to respondents who knew of each disease, chlamydia has a higher reported rate than herpes, 4.5% compared with  2.0%.  Knowledge  of  both of these STDs is strongly related to education and to

poverty level. These differences  in knowledge  appar­ ently affect the way  having  had  the disease is reported. In Figures 1-3, the reporting of gonorrhea  (presum­ ably well-known), is contrasted with chlamydia,  which had been heard of by a minority of respondents. Much higher rates of chlamydia were reported at the higher education levels, whereas this pattern did not hold for gonorrhea (Figure 1). Similarly, persons below 150% of the poverty level have a higher reported  rate of  gonor­ rhea and a lower rate of chlamydia  (Figure  2). In con­ trast to these socioeconomic measures, sexual behavior items are strongly related to reported disease in the

same direction. As Figure 3 shows, the rates of reported gonorrhea and chlamydia increased steadily with the number of reported lifetime sex partners.

Multivariate Analysis
  Results of the logistic regression  analysis  indicate that several types of variables were associated with gonorrhea. First, sexual behavior items (5 or more lifetime partners, age at first intercourse younger  than 15 years) were strongly related to having had gonor­ rhea (Table 3). Measures of race/ethnicity and socio­ economic background were also related to reported gonorrhea experience: being black, being below 150%  of the poverty level, being other than Protestant or Catholic (having no religion or other religion), and perceiving oneself to be at risk of AIDS were all sig­ nificant predictors in  the  regression  model.  Having had birth control education was associated with lower levels of reported gonorrhea. Women who had made public family planning visits and who desired addi­ tional births also had higher levels. Women who were never married, and who lived in nonmetropolitan ar-

eas and in the Midwest region, also had lower levels of reported gonorrhea.
  Sex behavior variables (5 or more lifetime partners, 2 or more partners in the past 3 months) were also strong predictors of reporting chlamydia (Table 3).  Persons who had a family planning visit in the past year had higher rates. Respondents with low education had lower rates, and those who had received some education on STDs had higher rates, indicating the possible effects of knowledge on reporting.

Discussion
  The analysis of these data from a national population­ based survey indicates that some of the same factors are associated with STDs that have been found in surveil­ lance and clinic-based studies, but the strength of the

relationship is not always the same. For example, in the survey data, black respondents were more likely than persons of other races or ethnic groups to report gonor­ rhea, but this difference, while strong, is much less than that indicated by surveillance data.
  In the logistic regression analysis of the survey data, black respondents were 2.6 times as likely as others to report having had gonorrhea; whereas in one study us­ ing surveillance data the rate of gonorrhea for  blacks was 24 times that of whites. 8 For chlamydia, on the other hand, we found no differences by race/ethnic group, although the survey data indicate that part of this difference may be due to differences in knowledge of chlamydia. Surveillance data are not available on chla­ mydia incidence among racial and ethnic subgroups. In one clinic-based study of chlamydia done by a univer­ sity health service, blacks were found to have a greater rate of infection than whites.9
Regarding differences in gonorrhea by race/ethnic
group, there is no reason why these distributions should be identical in the NSFG and surveillance data. It has been observed in one study, for  example,  that  mul­ tiple infections are more frequent among blacks.10 How­ ever, the very strong reversal of the pattern observed between the two data sources suggests that there may be differences in the populations covered by the two sys­ tems. Higher income women may, for example, be more likely to be treated by private physicians who may be less likely to report to the surveillance system.
  Because the survey data reflect past disease experi­ ence of the respondents, different trends in gonorrhea incidence between black and white women could ac­ count for the differences. However, trend analysis by race indicates that trends were similar for blacks and whites and that the large race difference was maintained throughout the 1980s decade,.4 11
  The associations we found between reported STDs and sexual behavior items are also similar . to those found in previous clinic-based research. As in the sur­ vey data, number of sex partners has frequently been found to be strongly related to STDs in clinic-based studies. 1-2 17 A young age at first intercourse, which we found to be associated with reported gonorrhea experi­ ence, has also been found to be a correlate of STDs in clinic-based studies.16•17 Finally, the survey finding that reported gonorrhea was higher for respondents below 150% of the poverty level is similar  to the higher rates of STDs at lower socioeconomic levels that have been found  in some clinic-based  studies.1, 6 17
  Disease rates based on self-reported survey data are subject to underreporting from a number of sources. These include asymptomatic infections of which respon­ dents are not aware, unwillingness to talk to the inter­ viewer about a sensitive subject, the inability to

remember past disease episodes, and having had a dis­ ease but not knowing its name. There are a number of reasons why survey reports of disease may be less com­ plete than surveillance data. For example, asymptomatic infections of which women are unaware may  most likely be detected in public clinics (and then reported to surveillance systems), where testing for them is routine. Surveys have a number of advantages over surveil­ lance data. They are designed to represent the entire population, (although in a household-based survey like the NSFG, the homeless and others living outside of households are not covered). Surveys can also include a large number of data items that can be used in analysis, items such as risk behavior, education, income, or atti­
tudes toward risk behavior.
  It is clear that self-reporting on a survey of lesser known diseases such as chlamydia is affected by knowl­ edge of the disease, which is itself strongly related to education and socioeconomic status. This pattern prob­ ably affects the relationships observed: for example, lower reported chlamydia among the least educated. Al­ ternatively, it is possible that in 1988 knowledge of chlamydia and the experience of a chlamydia diagnosis was related to the availability of testing, which  may have been greater among higher education and income women.
  In contrast, for surveillance systems the reporting of disease is presumably based on diagnosis and therefore accurate, but the system may not equally cover all seg­ ments of the population. Studies have found that private physicians may report only 3% to 50% of gonorrhea cases they treat.1-8 20 Data reported to the national and local surveillance systems are believed to be more com­ pletely reported from public sites than from private health providers.4•11•2-1 23 The majority of cases reported in the national surveillance system are from public providers (73% for men and 54% for women in 1990; unpublished data, CDC, Division of STD and HIV Pre­ vention). Furthermore, studies based on clinic popula­ tions have representativeness problems, because they may draw on low income populations or persons who  are already infected with STDs.

Conclusions
  Differences in national surveillance data and National Survey of Family Growth data suggest that the coverage of each system is different. The race/ethnic distribution is substantially different for gonorrhea cases reported in the surveillance system and cases of ever having gonor­ rhea reported in the NSFG.  Though  we  cannot  rule out other explanations because of basic differences in the statistics being compared, our results suggest  that the surveillance data may reflect underreporting of

308	ANDERSON ET AL.	Sexunlly Trnnsmitted Disenses • November-December 1994

higher socioeconomic groups making use of private health care. Survey data, on the other hand, are prob­ ably affected by underreporting of STD experience. In addition, survey data miss persons living outside of households who may be at higher risk for STDs.
  Regarding the survey data, some STDs are better known to respondents than others and may be reported more accurately. The lack of knowledge of some STDs is associated with education and socioeconomic vari­ ables, and this may obscure relationships observed in survey data. Sexual behavior items, such as numbers of lifetime sexual partners, are strongly associated with re­ ported STDs in the survey data, even for those STDs that are less well-known. Factors such as recent family planning visits and desire for more children are also as­ sociated with higher levels of reported STDs.
  Surveillance data, clinic-based studies, and population­ based survey data all have  advantages  and  disadvan­ tages for understanding STDs in a population. Each can provide a different perspective, and when taken together can give a more complete picture of disease and the fac­ tors associated with disease. Our analysis of the  NSFG data provides some insights that can be useful to STD prevention programs. The finding that a minority of re­ spondents knew of chlamydia, which  is  believed  to  be the most prevalent STD, suggests that increasing the awareness of less well-known STDs  may  be  necessary for prevention programs to be successful.
  Recently, a number of national surveys have been conducted and have added  greatly  to  our  understanding of the prevalence of sexual  risk  factors  in  the  general US population. 2-4 26 Questions to measure STD experi­ ence, treatment, and source of care on  surveys  of  this type would greatly increase  the  understanding  of  STDs in the national population. This will require research in developing questionnaire items that are understood by respondents and that produce the most accurate self­ reports of disease possible.
