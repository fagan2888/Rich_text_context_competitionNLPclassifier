Recent Trends In Self-Insured
Employer Health Plans
A look at the interplay among market forces, regulation, and employers'
decisions to self-insure.
by M. Susan Marquis and Stephen H. Long
Po l i c y m a k e r s a t both the federal
and state levels are interested in know-
ing how many private employer health
plans are self-insured andin identifying forces
that affect this number.1 These trends are im-
portant because fully insured plans and self-
insured plans are subject to different regula-
tory regimes.2 State insurance laws, which are
traditionally far more comprehensive, cover
only fully insured products purchased from
insurers. In contrast, federal laws cover both
types of plans, but with comparatively limited
provisions. Recently, however, federal regula-
tion of health coverage has been extended to
cover new dimensions.3 The ultimate reach of
regulatory provisions in affecting enrolled
workers and their dependents, therefore, de-
pends on the extent of self-insurance among
employers.
Numerous provisions of state insurance
regulation may cause an increase in the pro-
pensity of employers to self-insure. State
regulations frequently mandate that certain
benefits be covered in all policies issued by
health insurers, potentially adding to the cost
of fully insured plans.4 Other regulations that
may add to the relative cost of fully insured
plans are continuation of coverage and rate
regulation in the small-group market and lim-
its on preexisting conditions.5 States levy
taxes on the premium revenues of insurance
companies, which also raise the cost of fully
insured plans.6 Employers whose workplaces
extend across many states may object to the
added complexity or inequity among their
workers as a result of having to offer different
benefits in different states.7 Although the
trend over this decade toward increasing state
regulation of the small-group market was
thought to add to the incentive to self-insure,
the Health Insurance Portability and Ac-
countability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 included
some provisions that apply to both fully and
self-insured plans, thereby contributing to a
more level playing field.8
Recent dynamics in the health insurance
market also may be leading to changes in self-
insurance. The large cost increases of the late
1980s and early 1990s created strong pressure
for cost savings.9 There were rapid changes in
the types of products available to employ-
ers--especially in the availability of health
maintenance organizations (HMOs) to em-
ployers of all sizes.10 Small employers had im-
proved access to HMOs. For large employers
looking to control costs, this trend first pro-
vided new, fully insured alternatives to self-
insuring, but very recently there has been talk
of self-insured employers' being able to pur-
chase access to HMOs while remaining self-
insured--a phenomenon often termed "self-
insured HMOs."
In this paper we analyze data from two
large surveys of employers about their health
insurance benefit offerings. The data provide
evidence on recent trends in employers' pro-
pensity to self-insure and employees' propen-
sity to enroll in self-insured plans. We exam-
ine some possible causes of these trends.

METHODS
We compared estimates from the 1993 and
1997 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
(RWJF) Employer Health Insurance Surveys
to measure recent trends in self-insured plans.
The 1993 survey interviewed 22,347 private
employers in ten states.11 The 1997 survey in-
terviewed 21,545 private employers nation-
wide. The sample was concentrated in the
sixty communities followed by the RWJF
Community Tracking Study and in twelve
states having significant small-group rating
reforms for research on this state interven-
tion. These cases are supplemented by a sam-
ple from the remainder of the continental
United States to better represent the nation's
business establishments.12
For both surveys the sampling frame was
the Duns Market Identifiers national census
of employment establishments.13 Within the
geographic units described above, the sam-
ples were further allocated to strata defined
by the number of workers at the establish-
ment. In 1993 the response rate was 71 per-
cent, whereas in 1997 it was 60 percent. The
sample establishments have been weighted
for these analyses to account for different
probabilities of selection and nonresponse.
The weighted sample represents all private
employment establishments with at least one
employee. We used sampling weights to
make estimates for three different units of ob-
servation: establishments, employees, and in-
surance plan enrollees.
We examined trends in employers' deci-
sions to self-insure by comparing rates in the
seven states that are represented in both sur-
veys: Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, New
York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.
The 1993 survey included 15,403 employers in
these seven states, and the 1997 survey in-
cluded 8,711 employers. We also examined
several hypotheses about correlates of the
self-insurance decision using the full national
sample from the 1997 survey.
The surveys, based on similar question-
naires and definitions, used computer-
assisted telephone interviews averaging thirty
minutes each to collect the data. The inter-
views were conducted with the person or per-
sons in each establishment most knowledge-
able about health benefits and firm and
worker characteristics.
A number of specialized concepts and defi-
nitions were used in this work. We based our
definition of self-insured plans on the respon-
dent's self-assessment. In 1993 the question
asked about self-insured status was, "Are you
self-insured, or are you fully insured?" In 1997
the question was, "Is this a plan that is pur-
chased from an insurance company or HMO,
or is it a self-insured plan?" Further explana-
tion of this distinction, involving whether the
firm or the insurer bears financial responsibil-
ity for workers' medical claims, was provided
in both surveys if needed.14 A self-insured em-
ployer was defined as one that offered one or
more self-insured plans. Classification of a
plan as an HMO also was based on the re-
spondent's self-assessment, aided by a com-
plete definition of plan types if needed. Be-
cause self-insurance status and plan type
were collected independently, we were able to
identify self-insured HMOs.
Although the sample and analysis unit is
the establishment (a physical location of busi-
ness), for many analyses we categorized es-
tablishments according to the size of the firm,
which includes employees at all locations na-
tionwide. This is because insurance decisions,
including the decision to self-insure, typically
are made at the regional or national level in
firms with several establishments. As a meas-
ure of the extent of a firm's multistate busi-
ness operation, we used the number of the
firm's employees working in the same state as
the sampled establishment, divided by the
number of the firm's employees nationwide.15
We classified establishments according to
regulatory and market characteristics of their
location. The degree of small-group reform in
the state was measured as the interaction be-
tween whether all insurance products must be
guarantee-issued and how tightly premium
rates are regulated, if at all. We defined three
classes of reform: high (all products guarantee-
issued; rates cannot be based on health status,

with limited or no age variation allowed), me-
dium (all products guarantee-issued; rates
cannot be based on health status, with no or
limited restrictions on age variation), or low
(fewer or no restrictions).16 HMO penetration
was measured for the sixty Tracking study
sites and is based on tabulations from the em-
ployer survey data of the share of employees
enrolled in their employer-sponsored plan
who were in an HMO. It is defined as "low" if
the community is in the bottom quartile and
"high" if in the top quartile.
Finally, we measured both the current
health insurance premium level and the
change in the premium from the previous
year. The current premium level is based on
plan-specific data, reported separately for
individual and family coverage. For estab-
lishments offering multiple plans, we com-
puted an average premium for the estab-
lishment by weighting the premiums for the
separate plans by the number of enrollees. The
latter measure is based on an establishment-
level question about change in total health in-
surance cost per enrollee compared with the
previous plan year.
RESULTS
Between 1993 and 1997 self-insurance de-
clined in the seven states studied. The per-
centage of self-insured establishments fell in
all size groups (Exhibit 1), and the decline
ranged from 67 percent among small employ-
ers to 11 percent among large employers. Over-
all, in the seven states the number of self-
insured employers fell from 19 percent to 13
percent. Among employees enrolled in their
employer's group plan, the number enrolled in
a self-insured plan fell 18 percent. The likeli-
hood of being in a self-insured plan rises
strongly as firm size increases.
The decline in self-insurance appears to be
related to rapid change in market forces dur-
ing this period. Foremost was a very strong
shift toward employers offering managed care
plans. The percentage of employers offering
only fully insured HMOs soared from 12 per-
cent to 35 percent in the four-year period in
the seven states (Exhibit 2).17 Counting em-
ployees facing this type of offer, rather than
employers, yields a similar conclusion. The
shift to managed care came at the expense of
nearly all other combinations of plan offerings
and occurred among employers of all sizes but
was especially marked among workers in
firms with fewer than 100 workers, which are
shown separately in Exhibit 2.
Self-insured HMOs represented a small
part of the picture (2 percent of estab-
lishments and 6­9 percent of employees).
Hence, if there is to be a resurgence of self-
insurance through the vehicle of self-insured
HMOs, it has yet to emerge.
The strong move to HMOs appears to have
been driven, at least in part, by cost considera-
tions. In 1997 U.S. establishments offering an
HMO had average premiums across all of
their plans that were 7 percent lower for sin-
gle coverage ($164 versus $176­$177) and 3­7
percent lower for family coverage than were

premiums in establishments offering only
other types of plans, whether self- or fully in-
sured (Exhibit 3).18 Similarly, total premium
costs rose less between 1996 and 1997 for es-
tablishments offering an HMO than for oth-
ers, whether self-insured or fully insured.
Opportunity to take advantage of HMOs
also affects the likelihood of self-insuring. In
markets with high HMO penetration only 13
percent of employers self-insure, compared
with 19 percent in markets with low HMO
penetration (Exhibit 4). This differential pre-
vails among all firm sizes except the smallest
employers.
Tight small-group regulations do not ap-
pear to cause an increase in self-insurance
among small employers. The share of small
establishments that self-insure is fairly con-
stant, regardless of whether they are located
in states with low, medium, or high degrees of
small-group reform (Exhibit 4). Moreover,
the absence of an upward trend in the number
of small employers that self-insured over the
study period, during which these reforms
were legislated and implemented, furthersup-
ports the conclusion that small-group reforms
have not led to an upsurge in self-insuring by
small employers (see Exhibit 1). States with
strict rating reforms provide small employers
some longer-run protection against price in-

creases in purchased plans when a group
member becomes ill. The advent of these pro-
visions over the study period may have been a
factor in offsetting shifts to self-insurance that
otherwise might have occurred.
In contrast, the long-standing observation
that multistate employers are more likely to
self-insure is borne out in our data. Clearly,
most multistate firms are large employers.
Controlling for the effect of firm size on self-
insuring by examining firms with more than
500 employees, 35 percent of establishments
in firms with all of their employees in a single
state self-insure, compared with 63 percent of
establishments in firms with fewer than one-
third of their employees in the same state.
The reduction in self-insured estab-
lishments that occurred in seven states
between 1993 and 1997 suggests that
self-insurance behavior is indeed dynamic.
Our results suggest that market change may
have been more important than regulatory
change as a determinant of self-insurance de-
cisions. This topic deserves to be monitored
closely, however, in the face of continuing
rapid market and regulatory change.

ers self-insure some of the expenses (such as out-
of-network use)--that is, the employer made the
judgment whether to classify the plan either as
self-insured or fully insured.

number of different states in which the firm op-
erates, but the measure we used was the best
available to us, and we expect that it is corre-
lated with the former.

to Exhibit 4 for a list of the states in the high and

17. About 20 percent of employers classified as self-
insured in Exhibit 2 also offer fully insured prod-
ucts; about 40 percent of employees in self-
insured firms are offered both self-insured and
fully insured products. See Exhibit 1 for the num-
bers of employees enrolling in self-insured versus
fully insured plans.
18. Because we computed an average establishment
premium, the cost comparison between estab-
lishments that offer HMOs and those that do not
is not biased by enrollee selection effects among
types of plans within the establishment's offer-
ings. However, the cost differences may reflect
differences in the risk characteristics of estab-
lishments that do and do not offer HMOs.
