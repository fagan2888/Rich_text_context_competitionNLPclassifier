Objectives: To examine the size and composition of the privately held firearm stock in the US; and to describe
demographic patterns of firearm ownership and motivations for ownership.
Design, setting and participants: A nationally representative household telephone survey of 2770 adults
aged >18 years living in the US, conducted in the spring of 2004.
Main outcome measure: Responses to questions regarding firearm ownership, the number and types of guns
owned, and motivations for ownership.
Results: 38% of households and 26% of individuals reported owning at least one firearm. This corresponds to
42 million US households with firearms, and 57 million adult gun owners. 64% of gun owners or 16% of
American adults reported owning at least one handgun. Long guns represent 60% of the privately held gun
stock. Almost half (48%) of all individual gun owners reported owning >4 firearms. Men more often reported
firearm ownership, with 45% stating that they personally owned at least one firearm, compared with 11% for
women.
Conclusions: The US population continues to contain at least one firearm for every adult, and ownership is
becoming increasingly concentrated. Long guns are the most prevalent type of gun in the US but handgun
ownership is widespread. Ownership demographic patterns support findings of previous studies.
The General Social Survey, a biannual survey of the US
civilian population, has tracked household and personal
firearm ownership over the past two and a half decades.1
This survey reports the percentage of households with firearms
and personal firearm ownership for the nation as a whole and
for the nine major census regions. Over the past 4 years,
information from the General Social Survey has been supple-
mented by information on household gun ownership at the
state level from the National Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System.2 A clear pattern that has emerged over
the past several decades from these surveys is a persistent
decline in household gun ownership. Although these surveys
describe the demographic patterns of gun ownership in the US,
they provide almost no information about the characteristics of
or changes in the nation's gun stock.
We conducted a nationally representative household tele-
phone survey in 2004 to explore the characteristics of privately
owned firearms in the US. The last study to examine detailed
questions like these, such as the types and numbers of working
firearms in private homes, was conducted in 1994 by Cook and
Ludwig.3 In their comprehensive report, they found that 35% of
households and 25% of individuals owned firearms, and
estimated that there were 192 million working firearms in the
US in private hands. In addition to describing demographic
characteristics of firearm owners, they were able to determine
that the ownership of private firearms was highly concentrated
among a small percentage of owners. They also clearly
identified a difference in the number of household firearms
reported by married men and women, who, in theory, should
report similar rates of household firearm ownership. Their
findings, however, that married men reported a rate of 49%
household firearm ownership compared with 36% reported by
married women suggested that women were either unaware of
their spouse's firearm ownership or were reluctant to report it.
These results led the authors to believe that more complete
survey responses would come from individuals who personally
owned a firearm rather than the household responses.
All of these findings helped identify patterns of private
firearm ownership in the US and provided health professionals,
researchers and policy makers with information about the
private gun stock that was previously unknown. Through our
survey, we wished to investigate possible changes in the
privately owned gun stock between 1994 and 2004 and provide
additional information about firearm ownership patterns in the
US.
METHODS
The institutional review board at the Harvard School of Public
Health approved this study in 2004. The random-digit-dial
telephone sample (conducted by the survey research firm Fact
Finders, St Louis, Missouri, USA) comprised 2770 randomly
selected adults aged >18 years living in the 50 states and
including the District of Columbia. The number of interviews
designated for each of the states was proportional to that state's
population relative to the total population of the US as given by
the 2000 census. The methods used in composing this sample
assured that each household with a telephone had an equal
probability of being selected for inclusion in the sampling
frame. One adult from each household was randomly selected
to participate.
Interviews were completed between 17 March and 28 June
2004. Once a telephone number had been randomly selected for
inclusion in the survey sample, as many as 10 repeat phone
calls were made until a final disposition was assigned. Of the
31 302 telephone numbers called, 13 117 (42%) were non-
responses, 11 065 (35%) were not eligible and eligibility was
unknown for 4338 (14%). In total, 41% of the numbers were
not residential, not in service or were for households in states
where the interview quota had been reached. In addition, 39%
of interviews could not be completed because the maximum
number of calls had been made without an eligible respondent
answering the phone. Only 19% (5421) of the non-interviews
were refusals. According to calculations based on formulas
from the American Association for Public Opinion Research,4

our minimum response rate was 14%, assuming that all
unknowns were eligible and counting partial interviews as
respondents; and our maximum response rate was 18%,
assuming that all unknowns were ineligible.
Demographic characteristics including age, sex, education,
marital status, race, presence of children in the home, whether
the area was urban or rural, and household size of our sample
were compared with those from the 2000 census.5 Although the
demographic characteristics of our sample seemed similar
overall to that of the census, our respondents had slightly
higher educational levels (92% v total US 85% had at least a
high-school diploma) and single-family households were fewer
(19% v total US 26%). Our sample also under-represented adult
men aged 18­34 years. For that reason, post-stratification
weightings were applied to the data to reflect the age and sex
distribution of the US population. Adjustments for the like-
lihood of selection on the basis of the number of adults in the
household were also included in the weightings.
Our study included 40 active duty military personnel, who
represented 1.4% of the total study population. Eleven reported
owning firearms; however, only one reported owning the
firearm primarily for work. We therefore chose to keep all of the
respondents in the sample.
Respondents were asked several questions regarding firearm
ownership and use. In particular, they were asked, ``Do you or
anyone you live with currently have any guns in your home or
motor vehicles? Not including toys, models, air guns or starter
pistols.'' If the response was affirmative, the respondent was
then asked, ``In total, how many guns do you and anyone you
live with currently have in your home or motor vehicle?'' All
respondents who replied that there were guns in their house-
hold were asked how many of each type of firearm was in their
home (ie, revolvers, shotguns) and if they were in working
order. To determine the proportion of adults who personally
owned firearms, we asked those respondents who had replied
that there were guns in their home, ``Do any guns in your home
belong to you personally?''
Statistical analyses
Descriptive and bivariate analyses were used to explore the
relationships between firearm ownership, demographics, con-
centration and motivations for ownership. As previously
mentioned, research suggests that individuals who personally
own firearms report firearm ownership more accurately than
non-owners who live in households with firearms.6­8 All of our
reported analyses are therefore based on responses from
individual gun owners rather than respondents living in
households with guns, unless specifically noted that the
calculation was performed using household responses.
To produce national estimates of the number of firearms in
the US, we used population figures from the US census9 to
determine the number of adults aged >18 years and the
number of households in the US. We then calculated the
percentage of respondents in our survey who reported
personally owning a firearm. This number was applied to the
US population to create national estimates of the number of
adults who owned firearms. To estimate the number of firearms
in private hands, we multiplied the number of firearm owners
by the average number of firearms reported by respondents in
our survey. As firearm ownership is not normally distributed
and our survey included some extreme outliers in terms of the
number of firearms owned, we performed calculations exclud-
ing the outliers. As a sensitivity analysis, similar calculations
were performed using household reports of firearm ownership.
We also conducted comparative analyses among men and
women, and among respondents who lived alone and those
living in multi-person households.
RESULTS
Firearm owners reported that 60% of the firearms owned in the
US in 2004 were long guns, primarily rifles and shotguns (fig 1);
the remaining 40% were handguns. Among all firearms, rifles
were the most common, representing 33% of the gun stock.
Revolvers were the most common type of handgun. A small
percentage of respondents (5%) reported owning other hand-
guns, including derringers and antique handguns. Other long
guns, which include muzzle loaders and antique long guns,
represented 6%.
According to our survey, 38% of households reported at least
one firearm in the home and 26% of adults reported owning at
least one gun. This corresponds to 42 million households with
firearms and 57 million adult gun owners. We found that 64%
of gun owners or 16% of adults reported owning at least one
handgun; 80% of gun owners or 20% of all adults owned a long
gun (results not shown).
Ownership demographics
Firearm ownership was more prevalent among middle-aged
and older adults than among young adults aged 18­24 years
(table 1). Ownership of any firearm was more common among
men, those who were married or living with a partner, and
respondents living in rural areas or the South. Ownership was
strongly associated with whether the respondent grew up with
guns in the home. Among gun-owning households in our
survey, 46% had >1 adult gun owner.
Reasons for ownership
When respondents were asked, ``What is the one most
important reason that you own a handgun/long gun?'' the
most common response among those who owned a handgun
was for self-defense (46%), followed by sport shooting (hunting
or target shooting) or collecting (25%). Owners of long guns
overwhelmingly reported sport shooting as the ``most impor-
tant'' reason to own a long gun (77%; data not shown).
Concentration of ownership
Almost half (48%) of all individual gun owners, corresponding
to 13% of the US adult population, reported owning >4
firearms. Household ownership followed a similar pattern, with
41% of firearm-owning households reporting ownership of >4
firearms (table 2). The 20% of gun owners who owned the most
guns possessed about 65% of the nation's guns.

Number of guns
The actual number of guns reported in our survey varied
depending on how the question was asked and who answered
the question. Individual firearm owners (n = 702) reported
owning an average of 6.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.2 to
7.9, median 3) working firearms. On further examination, it
seemed that individuals who owned >4 firearms (with an
average of 12 firearms per person) were greatly affecting the
mean. When outliers representing the top 3% of gun owners
(those owning .25 guns) were removed, the average number
of working firearms per owner was 5.0 (95% CI 4.6 to 5.4). On
the basis of estimates of 26% of adults in the US owning at least
one firearm, we estimated that 57 million adults owned 283
million firearms (95% CI 260 to 305 million).
Estimates based on the number of household firearms were
lower. We estimated that 42 million households in the US
possessed at least one firearm in 2004, with an average of 5.2
(95% CI 4.9 to 5.6) guns per household, with outliers of .25
guns removed. The number of privately owned firearms in the
US based on these estimates would be 218 million (95% CI 206
to 235 million).
Reporting differences
Overall, men and women reported different rates of household
firearm ownership. Among married respondents who lived in
two-adult households, married men reported a household
firearm ownership rate of 54% and an average of 8 firearms
per household compared with a 40% ownership rate and an
average of 4.6 guns as reported by married women (table 3).
DISCUSSION
In general, our survey results are consistent with previous
reports of firearm ownership demographics.1 3 10 Firearms are
most likely to be owned by white men who live in a rural areas,
those who are middle-aged or older, with a middle to higher
income, who grew up with guns in the home and who live in
the southern or mid-western regions of the country. Long guns
continue to be the most prevalent type of gun in the US. Our
survey, however, reports a slightly higher percentage of
firearms that are handguns than that reported in 19943 (40%
v 34%). This shift to a greater proportion of handguns may be
reflective of the decline in hunting and indicate a change in
motivations and use of firearm ownership.10 Similar to previous

surveys,3 10 handgun owners were most likely to report owning
their handguns for self-protection, whereas owners of long
guns reported owning their guns for sporting purposes.
Individuals who own only handguns are just as likely to live
in an urban environment as a rural one and are demographi-
cally more diverse compared with owners of only long guns
who are more likely to be men and live in a rural area.
Our findings diverge from those of previous studies on
firearm ownership regarding the increase in the average
number of guns per gun owner. Although the rate of individual
(26%) and household (38%) ownership is similar to that in
other recent surveys,1­3 11 the number of guns reported per
person is higher. When including outliers, gun owners reported
an average of 6.9 guns per owner compared with 4.1 reported in
1994 (J Ludwig, personal communication, 12 January 2005).
The higher average number of guns in our survey is attributable
to the higher number of guns owned by those who owned >4
guns, as the percentage of gun owners in each category of gun
ownership (those owning 1­3 or >4 guns) has stayed almost
the same.
Cook and Ludwig3 reported an estimate of 192 million
working firearms in circulation in 1994. Although the popula-
tion increased 11% between 1994 and 2004, population growth
alone does not explain the differences in the number of guns
reported. A recent report by the National Research Council,
using national data on firearms manufactured, imported and
exported, estimated that 258 million firearms were available in
the US as of 1999.12 This estimate does not account for firearm
loss, breakage or those destroyed. When we calculated the
number of guns in the same manner as in the National
Research Council report, adding all available years, we
calculated that about 275 million guns were manufactured or
imported for private sale in the US by the end of 2003. As the
US does not require firearms to be registered (although some
individual states do), it is impossible to determine the exact
number of privately owned firearms in this country.
Our estimates of 283 million firearms in the US may be
higher than those that Cook and Ludwig established in 1994,
even with the population growth kept in context, for many
possible reasons. Our sample may have, by chance, captured
more affluent firearm owners who own many guns. We
adjusted for age and sex, but were unable to adjust for income
because our income-related questions were not comparable
with a standard such as the US census. Alternatively,
respondents may have overestimated the number of guns they
owned. Given that we are extrapolating from a survey of 2770
respondents to millions of Americans, small changes in the
number of reported firearms results in a large difference in the
national estimates.
The General Social Survey indicates that household gun
ownership has been declining over time, from about 50% in the
early 1970s to current estimates of 34%.1 Although the exact
number of firearms in the US may be debatable as a result of
inclusion or exclusion of outliers, or whether individual or
household responses are used, it seems that although the
proportion of households with firearms is declining, the number
of working firearms in the US is increasing, not decreasing, and
increasing most among those who already own firearms.
We also found evidence to support earlier research showing that
women report lower levels of household firearm ownership, and
in particular report fewer guns per household than men.6­8
Married women in our study reported an average of 3.4 fewer
household guns than married men and a difference in ownership
of 14% (54% in men v 40% in women). These findings reinforce
earlier recommendations for surveys of firearm ownership and
behavior,6 to seek information from individual firearm owners
rather than any person living in a household with a firearm.
Limitations
We have considered some of the challenges faced when
conducting telephone surveys, in particular those related to
asking household members to respond to questions about
topics, in this case firearm ownership, which may pertain to
other members of the household. This self-reported data may
also be subject to potential inaccuracies due to recall bias or the
tendency to report socially desirably responses.13 For example,
when we asked respondents two different questions to
determine how many firearms were in their households, one
asking for the total number of guns in the home and one asking
specifically how many of each type of gun were owned, we
often received two different numbers. Given that this was a
telephone survey, we were limited to adults with access to a
working telephone. If households without telephones were
more or less likely to own a firearm, then our findings could be
biased in the respective directions. Finally, non-response can

Key points
N Firearm ownership in the US is very common, with about
one third of all households owning at least one firearm.
N Long guns are the most prevalent type of gun in the US,
but 40% of the gun stock is handguns.
N Firearm ownership is highly concentrated, with a small
number of adults owning a large proportion of the
nation's firearms.
N Married men and women report different rates of
household firearm ownership, supporting the proposal
that researchers should seek information about firearm
ownership from individual firearm owners.

affect the validity of our findings if those choosing not to
answer a question differed systematically from those who did.14
The low response rate in this survey is similar to other random-
digit-dial telephone surveys15; however, it still allows for
potential bias if those who participated in the survey differed
in terms of firearm ownership from those who did not.
CONCLUSIONS
Implications for prevention
In the US, about one in four adults owns at least one firearm.
Although some other developed countries have similar rates of
personal firearm ownership, what is unique in the US is the
number of firearms privately owned. Researchers have esti-
mated about 25 guns per 100 people in countries such as
Canada, New Zealand, Germany, France and Sweden.16 On the
basis of current estimates from our survey, the US has 93 guns
per 100 people.
The National Academy of Sciences recently issued a report on
firearms and violence in which they called for improved data on
firearm ownership and use to advance the empirical evalua-
tions of programs and policies to reduce gun violence.12 Our
findings describe the current motivations for firearm ownership
and also provide information on the similarities and differences
among owners of different types of guns. This information can
assist in designing a more appropriate firearm injury policy as
well as understanding the denominator of exposure when
evaluating injury prevention interventions.
