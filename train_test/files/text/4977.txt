Special Issue Editorial- Digital Representations: Re-Using and Publishing Digital Qualitative Data
Introduction
The collection of papers in this SAGE Open Special Issue
on Digital Representations: Opportunities for Re-Using
and Publishing Digital Qualitative Data comprise five
contributions with a social science or social historical per-
spective that present the current state of the art in the field
of re-using and publishing digital qualitative data. They
reference major contributions to the literature and present
stimulating debates on the topics. The themed collection
builds on previously well-cited publications in which the
editors have presented state-of-the-art articles on second-
ary analysis of qualitative data, for example, the 2004
Special Issue of the International Journal of Social
Research Methodology on "Celebrating Classic Sociology:
Pioneers of Contemporary British Qualitative Research,"
edited by Paul Thompson and Louise Corti, and the subse-
quent 2012 Special Issue of the same journal on
"Perspectives on Working With Archived Textual and
Visual Material in Social Research" (Crow & Edwards,
2012; Thompson & Corti, 2004).
The articles address the use of digital sources in qualita-
tive research in both research and teaching, charting types of
use over the past couple of decades and looking forward to
emerging practices and methods. Critical perspectives on the
secondary analysis of qualitative data are discussed where
relevant across the set of articles, including returning to the
ongoing debate over whether or not the "contextualization"
of secondary data is essential to enable rich analysis.
The papers further address the promise and potential that
technological innovations can bring to enable new ways of
presenting and publishing qualitative research. Some of the
papers make use of direct linking allowing the reader to
explore "live" data sources, thus offering an insight into how
research transparency might be operationalized in the pre-
sentation of qualitative findings and reporting.
The Papers
All the authors reflect the contemporary interest in digital
representations and qualitative secondary analysis. Two of
the authors/editors (Corti and Bishop) have been central to
the international initiatives, both institutional and emergent
from within the research community, that mark the present
state of the art. The issue benefits from this experience, and
from the collaboration of all three editors in "Digital Futures,"

Abstract
This collection of papers comprises five contributions with a social science or social historical perspective that present the
current state of the art in the field of re-using and publishing digital qualitative data. The articles address the use of digital
sources in qualitative research in both research and teaching, charting types of use over the past 10 years, and looking
forward to emerging practices and methods, such as the promise and potential that technological innovations can bring to
enable new ways of presenting and publishing qualitative research. Some of the papers make use of direct linking allowing the
reader to explore "live" data sources, offering an opportunity to see how research transparency might be operationalized in
the presentation of qualitative findings and reporting. The papers reference major contributions to the literature and present
stimulating debates on the topic and build on previously well-cited publications in which the editors have presented state-of-
the-art articles on secondary analysis of qualitative data.

a funded project engaging with the cutting edge affordances
of Web 2.0 technologies and beyond in application to quali-
tative research, culminating in the U.K. Data Service's online
data browsing system, QualiBank (UK Data Service, 2014).
Corti and Fielding in their paper, titled "Opportunities From
the Digital Revolution: Implications for Researching,
Publishing and Consuming Qualitative Research," examine the
existence of knowledge and data in digital form and how these
offer opportunities for research and study (Corti & Fielding,
2016). They examine the role of "born digital" materials and
trust in, and persistence of, these sources. The paper addresses
the significant research opportunities brought by Big Data by
applying computational technologies to digital textual sources.
They offer exemplars of the contemporary use of qualitative
data within academia and citizen (social) science. The Internet
and other online media are re-shaping the discovery process
with crowdsourcing generating much new data and knowledge.
The authors note the need to understand new and emergent
modes of doing and reporting informal social science research
arising from these trends.What are the implications for research
data services in supporting access to these information sources?
The authors examine current practices in generating new kinds
of knowledge outputs, and in more formal academic publish-
ing, they note the role of the "enhanced publication," a peer-
reviewed digital output where readers can interact with primary
raw data sources. The paper addresses the need for the publish-
ing interface to enable easy authoring, and is mindful of the
effort involved by author and reader and the potential returns.
Finally Corti and Fielding's paper addresses the recent
debate about research transparency, drawing on value of rep-
lication of data and methods to enable openness, yet ques-
tioning how some traditional and specific research practices
might be eroded by inflexible journal publisher policies. The
authors highlight the intellectual and methodological chal-
lenges of demonstrating transparency of qualitative research
by showing various practical solutions for adding context to
data, and through transparency of production. Finally the
authors conclude on the strengths and weaknesses of the
analytic transparency, a policy recently proposed by
the political science community in the United States to evi-
dence claims made with data in academic publications.
Bishop and Kuula-Lummi's contribution, titled "Revisiting
Qualitative Data Reuse: A Decade On," provides a journey
through two decades of re-using digital qualitative data created
from previous research projects (Bishop & Kuula-Lummi,
2016). Re-use provides a unique opportunity to study the raw
materials of past research projects to gain insights for both
methodological and substantive purposes. In the past decade,
use of the approach has grown rapidly to become widely
accepted and practiced. This growth is explained by several fac-
tors such as the open data movement, research funders'policies
supportingresearchtransparencyanddatasharing,andresearch-
ers seeing benefits from sharing all manner of resources. A fur-
ther factor enabling data re-use has been improved services and
infrastructure, such as the U.K. Data Service and the Finnish
Social Science DataArchive, which provide access to hundreds
of data collections for social scientists.
Nevertheless, challenges remain when re-using qualitative
data and Bishop and Kuula-Lummi's paper engages with the
roles of context, ethical issues, and sampling from digital data
archives. Recent case studies of data re-use for studies of
health, food, family, and more are presented that illustrate inno-
vative approaches used in both research and teaching. Diverse
forms of collaboration among primary and secondary research-
ers work to fill in gaps of contextual information, and to gener-
ate deep insights into data. The case from Finland suggests that
their most popular qualitative data set is one generated for a
writing competition: a collection of 800 autobiographical nar-
ratives, including some fiction and poetry, on the conditions
and experiences of poverty. The writings' popularity for
research lends new insight to the academic debate over recov-
ery of context in secondary analysis, in particular negating the,
sometimes militant, view held by some social researchers about
the absolute necessity of rich context to support re-use of raw
data. Responses from users who have confronted the data say
that they did so with very little context and documentation
available, and further, did not express any need for it. This pro-
vides evidence that the depth and richness of a large data set
can ameliorate lack of context, and that it can stand on its own
as a resource to interrogate.
The two papers written by Lawrence and Elliott and
Sutcliffe-Brown are based on social historical reinterpreta-
tion of existing data from a well-known scholar who pub-
lished widely in the area of social class, Ray Pahl. They
present insight into the re-use of much older data sources,
digitized for the purpose of re-use and offer a methodologi-
cal focus that addresses methods of data sampling and selec-
tion in qualitative analysis. At a broad level, all three authors
are confronting a central debate in social theory--the relative
roles played by agency and structure.
Lawrence and Elliott in their contribution, titled "The
Emotional Economy of Unemployment: A Re-Analysis of
Testimony From a Sheppey Family, 1978-1983," re-use six
interviews from one couple, Linda and Jim, who had been
central voices in Pahl's book, Divisions of Labour (Lawrence
& Elliott, 2016). In their paper, the authors return to these
interviews to explore themes that had not been a focus for
Pahl's research, focusing on emotions and identity. In doing
so, they uncover new dimensions of agency in the stories
from Linda and Jim. Pahl was explicitly situating his work in
Thatcher's Britain and criticizing its policies, but Lawrence
and Elliott take a longer, more historical view on these mate-
rials. In their revisiting of the data, Lawrence and Elliott
develop a nuanced interpretation, one that acknowledges a
longer view by looking not only at how Linda and Jim
responded to critical periods of high unemployment but also
their changing relationships with benefits, home ownership,
and employment. These insights from seeing lives as a tra-
jectory portray a deeper understanding of the emotional
economy of unemployment.

Sutcliffe-Brown's (2016) paper, titled "New Perspectives
From Unstructured Interviews: Young Women, Gender and
Sexuality on the Isle of Sheppey in 1980," focuses on the
narrative of one person, a young working-class woman liv-
ing on Sheppey and her experiences in the early 1980s. She
re-explores this interview, asking questions of this narrative
that were not addressed by any of the original researchers. In
doing so, challenges of both missing context and ethically
sensitive material needed to be addressed.
Drawing on recent work on emotional history, Sutcliffe-
Brown analyzes this text using tools from oral history and
from feminist psychology. As the paper by Bishop and
Kuula-Lummi demonstrates, the presence of limited contex-
tual information does not preclude finding new insights
from data. Methodologically, this paper also demonstrates
the rich potential of drawing from multiple disciplines, such
as history and psychology.
Haaker and Morgan Brett in their paper on "Developing
Research-Led Teaching: Two Cases of Practical Data Re-Use
in the Classroom" examine the value of using real data to bring
to life teaching undergraduate sociology (Haaker & Morgan
Brett, 2016). They introduce two case studies. The first is
drawn from sociologist Annette Lawson who undertook
research in the early 1980s to explore the taboo topic of adul-
tery (Lawson, 1988). This data set, through its topic of interest
to younger people, presents opportunities for teaching aids and
accompanying guidance for classroom discussions, particu-
larly around relationship values and attitudes, sexual orienta-
tion, and the role of gender and socioeconomic status. The
second case study is based on Stan Cohen's 1972 publication
Folk Devils and Moral Panics, a core text for criminology in
A-level and university classrooms (Cohen, 1987). With its
focus on criminality, youth culture, and its depiction by the
mass media, it has captured the imagination of students for the
past 40 years. The authors show how they developed an inno-
vative teaching resource with substantive learning exercises
based on extracts of real data as well as other online resources.
The authors conclude by setting out how students can develop
a range of transferrable skills by confronting real data with sub-
stantive and relevant topics for research methods teaching.
