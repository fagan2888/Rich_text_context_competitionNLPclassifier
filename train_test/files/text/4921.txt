Introduction
At emergency departments in Sweden, long waiting times
and overcrowding have become the norm, which does not
only create dissatisfaction among patients but also involves
medical risks. Such departments are affected by patient
intake and discharge, as well as internal processes and staff-
ing, thus waiting times are difficult for staff to handle (Derlet
& Richards, 2000; Swedish Council on Health Technology
[SBU], 2010).
There have been numerous cases of medical error in
Swedish emergency departments (Källberg, Göransson,
Östergren, Florin, & Ehrenberg, 2013; The National Board
of Health and Welfare [Socialstyrelsen], 2013). Bodily harm
and mental suffering occur as a result of contact with the
health services. In Sweden, patient safety is defined by law
as protection against medical error, and each hospital must
work actively to reduce such risk (SFS, 2010:659). To work
proactive is a way to reduce the risks and according to Crant
(2000), proactivity results in individual questioning of the
status quo to create change, rather than passively adapting to
the existing situation.
Previous studies have revealed that a high workload
makes emergency department staff members become more
reactive, that is, reacting to something that already has
happened. Reactive can be defined as reacting to problems
when they occur instead of doing something to prevent
them (Rollenhagen, 2005), that is, a patient who becomes
hypotensive while waiting for medical assessment. The
organization's approach to patient safety also becomes
reactive as the deviation from standard procedure is only
focused upon after an incident has occurred. The area of
patient safety is still underdeveloped and has been
described as too focused on the individual, that is, the pro-
fessionals are subject to supervision and sanctions as
opposed to the organization and authorities responsible for
the healthcare system as a whole (Rollenhagen, 2005).
To improve patient safety and the working environment,
staff and management must be flexible, patient-focused, and
proactive (Rollenhagen, 2005). The latter implies taking
control and making things happen, anticipating and prevent-
ing problems, as well as seizing opportunities (Parker, Bindl,
& Strauss, 2010). The following is a comprehensive descrip-
tion of the concept of proactivity based on previous research:
The emergency room can be defined as a closed system
where its different parts affect each other. The activities at the
emergency room are, as Donabedian already highlighted in
1978, a triad of structure, process, and outcome (Donabedian,

Proactive Interventions: An Observational
Study at a Swedish Emergency
Department

Abstract
Overcrowding in the emergency department is a frequent topic in the news. This results in long waiting time and dissatisfaction
among patients, but also involves medical risks for the individual patient. When a high workload occurs in the emergency
apartment, staff members have to work harder, which leads to reactive behavior. To improve both patient safety and the
working environment, staff members and management need to be flexible, patient-focused, and proactive. Being proactive
means taking control and making things happen, anticipating and preventing problems, as well as seizing opportunities.
Emergency nurses perform advanced nursing interventions, a prerequisite of which is proactive behavior based on practical
nursing wisdom. Being proactive requires something beyond normal work performance. However, not all staff members
have sufficient knowledge and experience. Identifying proactive interventions that everyone can perform would be valuable.

2 SAGE Open
1978). A proactive personality identifies opportunities to act
and to avoid obstruction between these parts. This quality has
been found to have positive effects on work performance and
innovation. From a team perspective, the proactive individual
exhibits greater productivity and efficiency. Personal initia-
tive is when an individual actively takes the initiative, even if
it means going beyond the stated job description. High confi-
dence in one's ability to carry through own decisions increases
the individual's chances of performing beyond her or his offi-
cial duties. Personal initiatives that exceed prescribed assign-
ments and challenge the status quo are constructive for an
organization (Crant, 2000; Morrison Wolfe & Phelps, 1999).
An employee who is both willing and able to perform beyond
her or his professional duties is important for the flexibility of
an organization. The purpose of proactive behavior is
improvement, which may require the individual to develop or
even reformulate her or his role, representing a situation-
based approach to proactivity (Crant, 2000; Morrison Wolfe
& Phelps, 1999; Parker, 1998).
A narrative study by Kucera, Higgins, and McMillan
(2010) presents nurses' perceptions of advanced nursing
care. A characteristic of nurses who perform such interven-
tions is that they have foresight and consider the conse-
quences for all involved before taking action. Advanced
nurses focus on the patient, and their interventions often alle-
viate patient suffering. Their thoughts and actions form a
unit, as theoretical knowledge and experience constitute the
foundation of advanced practice. Experience-based knowl-
edge has been defined as a combination of theoretical and
tacit knowledge, intuition, experience, personal maturity,
and practical wisdom. It is developed in practical situations
by interaction with patients and discussion with colleagues
(Coles, 2002; McCutcheon & Pincombe, 2001).
When nurses perform advanced nursing interventions
based on knowledge and experience, it can be compared with
what Crant (2000) defined as a proactive personality.
Advanced nurses can be said to work on the basis of proactive
behavior, which requires something beyond the usual job per-
formance. However, not all nurses have sufficient knowledge
and experience. Identifying proactive interventions that less
advanced nurses can perform in stressful situations in the
emergency department would be valuable. In this study, we
focus on proactive actions as no previous study on proactive
activities in the emergency department has been found.
Aim
The aim of this study is to describe emergency nurses'proac-
tive activities as well as barriers to and opportunities for pro-
active work.
Method
By focusing on human interactions, the researcher can
understand and describe the participants' social reality by
participating in it. The ethnographic approach enables
descriptions of both events and actions as well as compris-
ing an emic and an etic perspective together providing a bal-
anced picture of the reality (Fetterman, 1998; Hammersley
& Atkinson, 2007).
Design
A case study with a qualitative approach inspired by ethnogra-
phy was performed. During the field work in an ethnographic
study, the participants' behavior is more or less influenced by
the researcher's presence (Hammersley & Atkinson, 2007).
Pellatt (2002) described this as reactivity in a group. Participant
observation is a data collection strategy that requires the
researcher to be open to the various processes. There is a risk
of the researcher becoming more subjective and lacking objec-
tivity by "going native" (Hammersley & Atkinson, 2007).
Thus, reflexivity is the basis for credibility and accuracy in
ethnographic research and requires the researcher to highlight
emerging social relationships and their possible impact on
future work (Pellatt, 2002). Observations are a qualified form
of data collection, during which a person's condition, non-
verbal language, and specific activities are studied. An ethno-
graphic design also contains interviews with key persons
(Polit & Beck, 2012).
In a qualitative study, it is important to reflect on one's
own pre-understanding of the phenomenon in question and
how it can influence the observations (Hammersley &
Atkinson, 2007). The data were collected by the first author,
who has 14 years of experience as a registered nurse, 10 of
which were spent in an emergency department.
Setting and Participants
The case study was conducted at a Swedish emergency
department with an annual patient flow of about 57,000 and
based on both participant observations and interviews. The
extent of the data, such as the number of observations and
interviews, is determined by what emerges during the data
collection. For this reason, the number of observations was
not determined in advance. The observations were performed
over the course of 1 week in spring 2013.
Interviews complemented the observations to gain a deeper
understanding of the phenomenon of proactivity. A strategic
selection of participants working during the actual study period
was made by the first author, leading to the recruitment of one
man and two women aged between 22 and 45 years. Nurses
with varying lengths of experience of working in the emergency
department were chosen to explore whether the number of years
in the profession influenced the perception of proactivity.
Data Collection
The observations were carried out by the first author who
followed four emergency nurses in their daily work and
Rehnström and Dahlborg-Lyckhage 3
made field notes structured as a protocol. Their time in the
profession ranged from 6 months to 19 years. This included
the time at which and location where the observation was
carried out, details of the various situations, who acted and in
what way. The researcher's own reflections were also docu-
mented. A total of 32 hr of observations were conducted to
identify proactive interventions.
Three other emergency nurses were interviewed. An
interview guide with the following open-ended questions
was used; in your opinion, what does a proactive approach
mean? Do you see any barriers to working proactively? Do
you see any opportunities for working proactively? The
interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.
Analysis
The field work was conducted in parallel with the reading of
and reflection on the field notes. This constituted a prelimi-
nary analysis, where the first reading provided ideas for new
approaches and questions for future observations. Nineteen
field notes were analyzed by means of content analysis and
various proactive interventions identified (for an example,
see Table 1).
The interviews were also analyzed by means of content
analysis on a manifest level (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004),
meaning that it is the transcribed text itself that is analyzed,
without interpretation. The recorded interviews were thus
transcribed verbatim and formed the unit of analysis. The
text was read several times and broken down into meaning
units, which were then condensed and abstracted to make the
text shorter and more manageable, while preserving the core
content. The condensed text was grouped into categories that
illustrate the nurses' opinions of various proactive interven-
tions (for an example, see Table 2).
Ethical Reflection
Ethical approval was obtained from the University West
EthicsCommitteebeforethestudybegan(No.2013/128B22).
The manager of the emergency department approved the
study, and each of the participating nurses provided written
consent. Only the nurses were observed, and the patients
were not included (Central Ethical Review Board, 2012). In
ethnographic studies, the researcher has close contact with
the participants, making it important to establish a good rela-
tionship with them. The researchers must be aware that their
presence may be perceived as intrusive or unpleasant and
should therefore leave in sensitive situations or ask the par-
ticipants to inform them when observations are not appropri-
ate (Hammersley & Atkinson, 2007). This was taken into
account during the study. The four ethical principles govern-
ing the humanities and social sciences were adhered to, thus
the study meets the requirements on information, consent,
confidentiality, and utilization (World Medical Association
Declaration of Helsinki, 2008).
Findings
The results of the observations and interviews, which have
been grouped into categories and sub-categories, are pre-
sented below.
Being One Step Ahead
The nurses identified risks in their assessment and prioritiza-
tion and tried to address them, such as giving medications
based on general prescriptions, meaning that pharmaceutical
treatment can be given by the nurse before the physician
encounter the patient. They would like more general pre-
scriptions and memorandums but worried that their own
expertise might be insufficient. The interviews revealed that
the nurses made risk assessments to maintain patient safety.
"Being one step ahead, identifying risks and taking action
before anything serious happens" (Nurse 1).
When the nurses had clear patient goals and care plans,
they could identify safety risks and take action to prevent
them. The observations revealed that with a higher inflow of
patients, the greater the importance of a proactive approach.

In particular, this concerned nurses who were responsible
for allocating internal resources by arranging various exam-
inations, such as in radiology, at the early stage of the care
continuum.
Preparing the patient before the medical assessment reduced
the total time of the care process, which also benefited the
patient. "In triage it takes more time to write a note about the
deep vein thrombosis on the assessment form, although I think
it benefits the patient in the long run" (Nurse 3).
Being Able to Start Proactive Interventions
One of the observations highlighted teamwork between a
physician and a nurse. The team took care of patients upon
arrival. The collaboration between the two professional
categories ensured focus on the patient and the formulation
of a clear care plan, which shortened the administrative pro-
cedure. An example was when the physician and the nurse
accompanied the patient for a chest X-ray test and obtained
direct response. This patient passed quickly through the
emergency chain, demonstrating a proactive approach.
The observations showed that the number of proactive
interventions carried out when the patient inflow was high
largely depended on the nurse responsible for coordinating
the work in the emergency department.
If you work in a different way [more proactively] it may well be that
it will lead to less work and quicker handling, which will prevent a
bottleneck developing here and having to move patients around. If
we stay on our toes from the start, we can save time. (Nurse 1)
Figure 1. Prerequisites for proactive work.
Rehnström and Dahlborg-Lyckhage 5
Prerequisites for Proactive Work
The gradual development of a proactive approach was
described by a nurse as follows:
Proactivity develops gradually. You may not be very proactive
when you are new on the job as an nurse . . . it will come with
time, experience and understanding of what you're doing.
(Nurse 1)
During the interviews, the nurses highlighted the impor-
tance of gaining skills through training, which to some extent
would make them willing to assume more responsibility.
They considered that there was a need to upgrade the skills of
all staff members as well as for additional memorandums and
guidelines. "It would be possible to do more if it was made
clear how we should work, i.e., more guidelines" (Nurse 3)
In the observations, it was noted that experienced nurses
could identify new questions and cues that facilitated a more
accurate assessment based on patients' narratives. They could
also clearly envisage the likely treatment plan and therefore
worked more proactively than their less experienced colleagues.
An example from the observations was the treatment of a
patient with newly discovered diabetes. The experienced nurse
took an arterial gas sample shortly after the patient had entered
the triage room to determine further interventions. She then per-
formed the routine checkups and put the patient on a drip. The
patient's blood glucose was 24 mmol / l (432 mg/dl), and when
the result of the arterial gas sample was available, no acidosis or
electrolyte disorders were found. The nurse knew that if the
blood glucose could be corrected in the emergency department,
the patient could probably go home after medical assessment.
The nurse asked a physician to prescribe rapid insulin, which
she administered to the patient. When the patient was subse-
quently assessed by a physician, the blood sugar had normalized
and she or he was able to return home with oral treatment for the
diabetes and follow-up at her or his health center. This nurse
used advanced nursing interventions thanks to her long emer-
gency department experience.
Working Reactively
Organizational barriers to a proactive approach were mentioned
by all the informants. Such barriers included time constraints,
shortages, hierarchy, an increased number of patients, poor col-
laboration between hospital departments as well as between
municipal care, primary care, and the county council. When the
continuum of care did not function in an optimal way, the staff
lost control of patients' care plans and reverted to a reactive
approach, which meant patients having to spend more time in the
emergency department as well as a risk to their safety.The nurses'
work environment was also affected, resulting in negative stress.
The patient has to wait before being transferred to the ward . . .
continue caring for those who are ready for transfer to the ward. . . .
there is no time to work proactively with other patients. (Nurse 2)
Less proactive interventions were used if the nurse had
little skill and experience. The observations also high-
lighted a difference between nurses in terms of length of
prioritization and assessment experience. For example, two
nurses with between 1 and 3 years of experience asked
standard questions about the patients' condition and lacked
the ability to follow up on important cues that emerged
from patients' narratives. They carefully adhered to and
based their assessment on standard care plans. This was in
contrast to the work conducted by two other nurses with
between 14 and 19 years of experience. In addition to stan-
dard questions, they were able to identify new questions
and cues that facilitated a more accurate assessment. They
could also clearly envisage the likely treatment plan and
therefore worked more proactively than their less experi-
enced colleagues.
To illustrate proactivity a narrative was constructed from
the data.
A morning at the emergency department.10:16 a.m.: Some
patients have been in the emergency department overnight
but generally it is quiet. New patients begin arriving, and
within 2 hr the department is crowded. When the seventh
patient's name is called, the nurse notices an elderly woman
who was brought to the ward in a wheelchair by a relative. On
the referral note, the nurse read that the General Practitioner
(GP) suspected a deep venous thrombosis in the left leg. The
relatives had driven the patient 60 kilometers in their own car
from the health center to the hospital. The nurse takes the
patient's medical history while an assistant nurse checks the
patient's blood pressure, pulse, oxygenation capacity, respira-
tory rate, and temperature. The nurse then examines the
patient's leg and comes to the conclusion that the referral is
incorrect and diagnoses a partial Achilles tendon rupture, an
orthopedic disorder, being one step ahead. The emergency
orthopedic clinic is located in a hospital 30 kilometers away.
However, the nurse does not have the authority to change the
referral, which can only be done by a physician after exami-
nation of the patient. The nurse now tries to contact the emer-
gency physician on duty, but without success. Expected
waiting time for the physicians on the medical emergency
ward is about 4 hr for low priority patients. The nurse's goal
is for this patient to obtain appropriate care from the right
physician as quickly as possible. She realizes that the patient
will have to stay in the emergency department for at least 4 hr
before probably being referred to the orthopedics department.
She phones the orthopedic clinic at the same hospital and con-
tacts the orthopedic surgeon on call, and start proactive inter-
ventions. The orthopedic department staff usually only treat
patients who have an appointment. However, the orthopedic
surgeon is able to come to the triage room to examine the
patient and confirms a partial Achilles tendon rupture. The
patient is brought to the orthopedic clinic where she is set in
plaster and discharged.
6 SAGE Open
In this narrative, the nurse was one step ahead and envis-
aged the patient's passage through the continuum of care as
well as the probable treatment plan. The definitive treatment
plan is determined by the physician after her or his assess-
ment of the patient. The use of standard care plans for vari-
ous medical conditions is common in the emergency
department. Although these are helpful when the patient's
diagnosis is clear, they are not individualized and require the
nurses to assess the patient's medical condition. In the above
scenario, the patient had leg pain and the GP suspected a
deep vein thrombosis. Experience combined with practical
and theoretical knowledge is a prerequisite for nurses to act
in accordance with a likely treatment plan and provide indi-
vidualized care. In the above example, the nurse used
advanced nursing interventions and exhibited practical wis-
dom as prerequisites for proactive work.
Discussion
The proactive interventions described are only possible if the
necessary conditions are in place. Many obstacles to proac-
tive work were organizational. Lack of time, overcrowding,
as well as poor internal and external collaboration are some
examples. We observed that opportunities for proactivity
increased when the care plan was established at an early
stage of the continuum of care and when all team members
were aware of it.
Patient safety would probably be improved by nurses con-
tinually assessing risk and priority. A clear care plan facili-
tates and simplifies risk assessment, which is likely to enable
nurses to work toward a common goal where proactive
patient care is in focus. Formulating a care plan requires the-
oretical, practical, and experiential knowledge. The nurses
who performed advanced nursing interventions had such
knowledge. The fact that some nurses possessed practical
wisdom, which according to Crant's (2000) theory can be
equated with a proactive personality, meant that they worked
more proactively.
Oberle and Allen (2001) attempted to define what is
required for nurses to be able to perform advanced nursing
interventions and suggested that practical wisdom is a hall-
mark of such nurses. Practical wisdom enables the nurse to
know when a particular action should be initiated and when
it gives maximum benefit to the patient, indicating that skills,
ability, and maturity are the main attributes of the advanced
nurse in practice. Aristotle described three forms of knowl-
edge: episteme, techne, and phronesis. Episteme is "true"
knowledge, as it is general and safe. Techne is preparedness
for how to perform practice. Phronesis is reflection in the
form of moral reasoning with the intention of doing "good"
in a given situation and important for the development of
practical wisdom (Connor, 2004; Dahlborg-Lyckhage &
Pennbrant, 2014).
By informing patients about the likely care plan, nurses
are in a position to prevent the suffering of care as well as
increasing patients' feeling of being looked after, thus allevi-
ating their sense of powerlessness and uncertainty. Patients'
experience of care is of great importance both for the indi-
vidual herself or himself and as an indicator of the quality of
care and what needs to be improved. Patient satisfaction is
influenced by the care process (Cooke, Watt, Wertzler, &
Quan, 2006; Dahlberg & Segesten, 2010).
During the observations, it was found that teams compris-
ing a physician and a nurse were beneficial for patients, as
there was greater focus on them and the treatment was pro-
vided with less delay. Problems arose when the team had to
deal with too many patients, as for example, the physician
had time to examine a new patient while the nurse did not;
thus, the positive effects of teamwork were lost. Previous
studies have revealed that teamwork functions best when the
team members jointly conduct the first assessment of each
patient (Lau & Leung, 1997; Mazzocato, Hvitfeldt Forsberg,
& Von Thiele Schwarz, 2011).
The long waiting times due to an increase in the number of
patients led to the suffering of care and also posed a risk to
patient safety. When nurses had to keep track of too many
care plans, continuous re-prioritization and risk assessment
became impossible. The nurses experienced this as negative
stress, which in turn can lead to decreased cognitive function-
ing and is one reason why there is a greater risk of making
mistakes while under stress. While individual professionals
can handle stress, it becomes more difficult in a context where
both the organization and the technology make high demands.
Tools that can provide an overview of patients' care plans
would be valuable (Rollenhagen, 2005; SOU, 2008).
The nurses considered that there was a need for all staff
members to develop higher skills in order to be able to work
proactively. A high level of competence is important for both
the individual patient and the emergency department organi-
zation (SBU, 2010).The ability to perform advanced nursing
interventions may thus evolve over time, which means that
Figure 2. Factors leading to a reactively work.
Rehnström and Dahlborg-Lyckhage 7
nurses can gradually develop a proactive approach. The
study revealed various proactive interventions that nurses
perform irrespective of their level of skill, such as improving
various forms of documentation and guidelines.
In other parts of the world, emergency departments are
staffed by specially trained "nurse practitioners." In the United
Kingdom, this has generally led to benefits for patients (Byrne,
Richardson, Brunsdon, & Patel, 2000; Sakr et al., 2003). Nurse
practitioners perform advanced nursing interventions and their
skills are utilized, which could also increase the quality of
emergency department care in Sweden.
The observations indicated both organizational and
skills related barriers to and opportunities for maintaining
a high level of patient safety. Due to the long waiting time
for physicians, the nurse's skill in prioritizing patients'
medical conditions was important. The study revealed that
the nurses' experience affected their assessment of a
patient's medical condition. Lack of skills and time ren-
ders the organization vulnerable, possibly resulting in
poorer patient safety (Andersson, Omberg, & Svedlund,
2006). In an organization such as that in which the study
was conducted, staff members possess different levels of
experience and skills; thus, not everyone can perform
advanced nursing interventions. It is therefore important
that the organization provides nurses with opportunities
and conditions to work in a way that can develop their
practical wisdom over time. Being involved in and able to
influence their workplace promotes individuals' learning
ability, as they are shaped by each other. The organization
plays a major role in supporting human relations, work
ethics, motivation and the creation of a stimulating learn-
ing environment (Andersson, 2013).
Organizational conditions that sustain and enhance staff
skills could be a first step in promoting more concrete proac-
tive interventions which, in combination with a clear focus
on the patient, would ultimately generate a higher level of
patient safety and indirectly cost-effectiveness (Olsson,
Hansson, Ekman, & Karlsson, 2009).
Limitations of the study
Performing an observational study at one's own workplace
involves both advantages and disadvantages. The benefit of
an emic perspective is that the researcher's pre-understand-
ing can lead to a deeper comprehension of and a trusting rela-
tionship with the participants. A disadvantage may be that it
is difficult to be objective. The first author's pre-understand-
ing included experiences as a nurse and theoretical knowl-
edge, but also preconceptions. Taken together, this may have
influenced the results of the data collection as well as the
analysis and interpretation. During the observations, the role
of participant observer enabled the researcher to be close to
the participants, but without losing the distance necessary for
the objectivity of the data collection and subsequent analysis
(Labaree, 2002).
The first author was known in the department, which
made it easier to perform the study in the limited timeframe.
However, the researcher is also influenced by the partici-
pants. In the present study, this meant that on some occa-
sions the researcher had to prevent herself from entering
into a nurse role. Reflexivity can be achieved by moving
between reflection and the field notes, something that was
done. To achieve credibility, sources of potential influence
should be made visible and discussed with the co-author
throughout the study. Citations have been presented to
strengthen credibility, and the analysis remained close to
the original text. However, a certain degree of abstraction
and interpretation is needed for the result to be deemed
meaningful and comprehensible (Hammersley & Atkinson,
2007; Pellatt, 2002).
Conclusion
It is not easy to identify and describe proactive interventions,
as emergency work is very complex and dynamic. Various
care interventions, tasks, and processes are interdependent.
When something is done in one part of the system, it affects
another. Nevertheless, the study has contributed knowledge
of proactivity within emergency departments and highlighted
various ways of increasing patient safety, which involve
looking beyond the organizational problems and cost effi-
ciency to ensure that the patient is prioritized. The proactive
interventions concerned concrete actions aimed at benefiting
patients in both the short and the long term. More research is
needed on how proactive interventions can be implemented
in practice. Much of the frustration experienced by patients
as well as staff in an emergency department concerns antici-
pation. Patients and nurses have to wait for, among other
things, the physician, patients to be admitted to a ward, and
X-ray test results. For nurses, this study may contribute to
the understanding of how one can work proactively to pro-
mote the patients' progress in the continuum of care while
maintaining patient safety. The results presented might be
useful for nurses who have not yet developed practical wis-
dom and the hope is that they will become a basis for discus-
sion, contributing new ideas that can help them in their daily
work. Opportunities for education and systematic reflection
must be present in the organization to enable nurses to work
proactively.
