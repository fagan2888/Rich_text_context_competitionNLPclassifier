Although people with diabetes mellitus have a high risk of depression and depression may increase mortality
among people with other conditions, the impact of depression on mortality risk among people with diabetes needs
further examination. Using survival analysis, the authors analyzed longitudinal data from the NHANES I
Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (1982­1992). The findings showed that the presence of severe depressive
symptoms significantly elevated mortality risk among US adults with diabetes; the same pattern was not observed
among people without diabetes. After results were controlled for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-status
variables, diabetic persons with Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale scores of 16 or
more had 54% greater mortality than those with scores under 16 (p 5 0.004). After exclusion of participants who
died during the first year of follow-up, mortality remained higher among those with CES-D scores greater than or
equal to 22 as compared with those with CES-D scores less than 16, but not among those with CES-D scores
between 16 and 21. No significant relation between depression and mortality was found in the nondiabetic
population. This analysis indicates that diabetes modifies the effect of depression on mortality. It also
demonstrates the importance of observing subgroups, rather than aggregated populations, when examining
the effect of depression on mortality.

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the United States
has increased rapidly in recent years, with a 49 percent
increase in diagnosed diabetes being observed between
1990 and 2000 (1). During 2002, it was estimated that 18.2
million Americans had the disease--13.0 million diagnosed
and 5.2 million undiagnosed (2). Diabetes is a leading cause
of death in the United States. During 2000, the disease
accounted directly for 69,301 deaths and contributed to
213,062 deaths among persons aged 25 years or older (1).
Diabetes is also a major cause of loss of quality-adjusted life
years, largely because of vascular complications (3).
Diabetes is associated with depression and depressive
symptoms, but the strength and causal direction of these
associations are unclear (4­10). In two recent studies that
used data from the First National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES I) but utilized different
instruments to measure depressive symptoms, investigators
came to different conclusions about the role of depression as
a cause of diabetes mellitus (11, 12). Saydah et al. (12),
using the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
(CES-D) Scale, found no evidence to support an etiologic
relation between depression and diabetes. Conversely,
Carnethon et al. (11), using the General Well-Being De-
pression subscale, found that if social factors such as
educational attainment are taken into account, depressive
symptoms predict an increased incidence of diabetes among

people with less than a high school education. Depression
has also been found to affect glycemic control and both
macrovascular and microvascular complications (13­20),
but it is unclear whether there is a reverse causal relation
(i.e., whether diabetes causes depression) (7, 21, 22). In
a review, Talbot and Nouwen (21) stated that there is no
solid evidence that the initial occurrence of clinically
significant depression results either from biochemical
changes directly attributable to type 2 diabetes or its
treatment or from the psychosocial demands imposed by
the illness or its treatment.
A similar ambiguity exists with regard to the relation
between depression and mortality. As many studies report
that depression is associated with increased mortality in
general populations, especially among older adults (21, 23­
27), as indicate no such relation (28­33). In a systematic
review of the relation between depression and mortality,
Wulsin et al. (34) identified 57 studies carried out between
1966 and 1996, of which 29 demonstrated positive results,
13 negative results, and 15 mixed results. Further examina-
tion (35­42) revealed that a relation may exist between
depression and excess mortality only when subjects have
certain illnesses--such as coronary artery disease (42),
myocardial infarction (35, 36, 40), stroke (38, 41), conges-
tive heart failure (39), or ischemic heart disease (37)--or
when subjects have a disadvantaged social position with low
income or less education or are socially isolated (43­45).
However, we have not identified any study that directly
compares the depression-associated mortality rates of pop-
ulations with and without medical conditions at baseline.
In this study, we examined the association between
depression and diabetes by studying the relation between
depressive symptoms and mortality among people with
diabetes. We used a nondiabetic population as a comparator
to determine whether depressive symptoms played the same
role in mortality among persons with and without diabetes
while controlling for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and
health-status variables.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study used data from the NHANES I Epidemiologic
Follow-up Study (NHEFS). The NHEFS is a follow-up
study of adults who participated in NHANES I, which was
conducted from 1971 to 1975. NHANES I included four
follow-up surveys; the first one was conducted between
1982 and 1984, the second one in 1986, the third one
between 1987 and 1989, and the last one between 1990 and
1992. The NHEFS study population was drawn from
a probability sample of noninstitutionalized civilian US
adults aged 25­74 years (n 5 14,407). In the NHEFS, the
vital status of 93 percent of the original NHANES I sample
was traced through 1992.
This study included the subgroup of NHEFS adult
participants who had baseline diabetes status and depressive
symptoms assessed in 1982­1984 at age 32 years (n 5
9,990). The vital status of these participants was ascertained
for the period 1982­1992. Because data from the physical
examination conducted at baseline did not provide adequate
information by which diabetes could be identified (i.e.,
plasma glucose level, fasting plasma glucose level, or results
of oral glucose tolerance testing), diabetes was assessed by
self-report, with information derived from two survey
questions: ``Did a doctor ever tell you that you had diabetes
or sugar diabetes?'' and ``Are you now taking medicine for
this condition (diabetes)?'' In total, 714 (7.1 percent)
persons with diabetes and 9,276 persons without diabetes
were identified. Using information from each follow-up
survey question on the subject's vital status, we identified
229 deceased cases in the diabetic population and 1,614
deceased cases in the nondiabetic population. This vital
status information was based on death certificates (98.7
percent of death cases) and proxies' reports (1.3 percent of
death cases). Because of missing or incomplete information
on date of loss to follow-up and CES-D scores, 156
participants with diabetes and 2,213 participants without
diabetes were excluded from our analysis. Thus, the
analyzed diabetic population was reduced to 558 (276
deaths, 282 survivors), and the analyzed nondiabetic pop-
ulation was reduced to 7,063 (1,499 deaths, 5,564 survivors).
Survival time, or the amount of time that elapsed from the
date of the 1982­1984 interview to the date of death or
censoring, was the outcome variable in our survival
analysis. Survival time (in weeks) was defined in terms of
the following variables: 1) date of interview in the 1982­
1984 follow-up survey, 2) date of later follow-up interview,
and 3) date of loss to follow-up or date on which the subject
was last known to be alive as reported by a proxy (date of
censoring). Survival time was calculated as the date of death
or censoring minus the date of interview in the 1982 survey.
Independent variables evaluated included depressive
symptom score, demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and
health status. The first group of variables constituted the
explanatory variables of primary interest, and the other
groups of variables were potential confounders.
We assessed depressive symptoms using the CES-D
questionnaire, which consists of 20 descriptive statements
of depressed mood; feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness,
and loneliness; loss of appetite; sleep disturbances; concen-
tration problems; and psychomotor retardation. Although in
previous studies a score of 16 was defined as clinical
depression (46) and a score of <16 was defined as ``not
depressed'' (47), we treated the cutoff score not as diagnosed
depression but as an indicator of risk for clinically significant
impairment. We also categorized persons as having either
moderate (scores of 16­21) or severe (scores >21) de-
pressive symptoms. The CES-D questionnaire is reliable and
valid (48), with high sensitivity and adequate specificity as
a screening instrument for depression (49). Scoring for the
four positively worded items was reversed in this study.
Consequently, the 20 items, which were scored on a standard
four-point scale from 0 to 3, had a potential range of 0­60,
with the higher scores representing responses in the de-
pressed range. Only persons who answered all 20 items
on the questionnaire were included in our primary analysis
(50, 51).
We controlled for age, gender, race, marital status,
residential area (rural vs. urban), education, work status,
and income, since there are known correlations between
Depression and Mortality in Persons with and without Diabetes 653

mortality and these sociodemographic variables (52­55).
We also included five lifestyle variables as control factors,
since they are known to be associated with mortality (56,
57): ever having smoked at least 100 cigarettes, current
smoking, alcohol consumption (number of drinks per day),
currently being on a diet for weight loss, and physical
activity level (on a three-point scale: quite inactive (1 point),
moderately active (2 points), or very active (3 points)).
Because health status has been found to be a good predictor
of mortality (58, 59), we also adjusted for eight health-status
variables: self-rated health; body mass index (weight (kg)/
height (m)2); a history of cancer, hypertension, heart attack,
or stroke; blindness; and current use of antidepressants.
The analyses were conducted in three steps. First, using
survival analysis, we examined the individual effects of
explanatory and control variables on mortality. Variables
that were significantly related to mortality in either diabetic
or nondiabetic subgroups were used in our final model.
Second, using survival analysis and the Cox proportional
hazards model, we examined the association between
depressive symptoms--as measured by the CES-D
Scale--and mortality while controlling for physical health-
status variables. We categorized CES-D results in two
different ways. First, participants were stratified by CES-D
score: <16 vs. 16. Second, participants were stratified into
three groups based on their CES-D scores: <16 (group 1),
16­21 (group 2), and 22 (group 3). Finally, in order to
examine the possibility that the relation between depressive
symptoms and mortality was explained by concurrent
terminal illness, severe disease, or severe depression, we
conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine differences
among subjects after excluding participants who died within
the first year of follow-up. We also compared mortality
among participants who answered all 20 items on the
questionnaire with mortality among participants who an-
swered at least 17 items. We performed these analyses using
the SPSS statistical software package (version 9.0 for
Windows (60)).
RESULTS
Baseline descriptive data for the outcome variable and
its covariates are presented in table 1, along with the dif-
ferences found between the diabetic and nondiabetic
population groups. Within the diabetic and nondiabetic
populations, we observed no significant differences in
sociodemographic characteristics, CES-D scores, lifestyle
variables, or physical health-status variables between the
total original sample and the subgroup of respondents who
had both adequate CES-D scores and acceptable dates of
death or loss to follow-up (statistics for the total original
sample are not shown here). With 276 deaths and 282
presumed survivors in the diabetic subgroup (49.5 percent
cumulative mortality) and 1,499 deaths and 5,564 survivors
in the nondiabetic subgroup (21.2 percent cumulative
mortality), during the period 1982­1992, the average
survival time was 7 years in the diabetic population and
8.5 years in the nondiabetic population. The prevalence of
CES-D scores greater than or equal to 16 in the diabetic
cohort was 26.3 percent (age-adjusted: 25.9 percent), and
the prevalence in the nondiabetic cohort was 15.8 percent
(age-adjusted: 16.2 percent),
In the cohort of 7,621 adults who were included in our
primary analysis, nondiabetic participants, as compared
with diabetic participants, were younger (mean age 5
56.8 years vs. 64.2 years); were more likely to be White
(86.8 percent vs. 76.3 percent), married (68.7 percent vs.
57.4 percent), highly educated (11.4 years of schooling vs.
9.6 years), and employed (17.2 percent vs. 9.9 percent); and
had higher incomes (mean score on a six-point income scale
(see table footnotes): 4.0 vs. 3.1). The nondiabetic cohort
was also healthier than the diabetic cohort on the basis of
self-reported better health (mean score on a five-point Likert
scale: 2.5 vs. 3.6) and lower body weight (body mass index:
25.3 vs. 29.8); were less likely to have a history of cancer
(4.4 percent vs. 5.6 percent), hypertension (35.1 percent vs.
64.3 percent), heart attack (5.1 percent vs. 15.4 percent), or
stroke (1.0 percent vs. 5.0 percent); were less likely to have
blindness (1.4 percent vs. 3.6 percent); and were less likely
to currently use antidepressants (2.3 percent vs. 3.6 percent).
In addition, the nondiabetic cohort, as compared with the
diabetic cohort, was more likely to have smoked at least 100
cigarettes (54.4 percent vs. 49.5 percent), to smoke currently
(27.3 percent vs. 19.5 percent), and to consume more
alcohol (mean number of drinks per day: 1.4 vs. 0.8) and
was less likely to be dieting for weight loss (4.6 percent vs.
24.7 percent). Finally, the nondiabetic cohort, in comparison
with the diabetic cohort, was more physically active (mean
physical activity scale score: 2.1 vs. 1.8).
Figures 1 and 2 show the unadjusted survival functions
stratified by CES-D scores. These functions demonstrate
the expected positive relation between depression and
mortality--that is, the group with lower CES-D scores had
longer survival. The two survival functions in each figure are
parallel, suggesting that depression satisfies the proportional
hazards assumption. However, although the survival func-
tions were significantly separated from each other in the
diabetic cohort, they were not so in the nondiabetic cohort.
Before constructing our final model of survival analysis,
we identified the following independent variables that were
not significantly related to mortality (a 5 0.05) when
entered individually into the model: rural residence, current
smoking, alcohol consumption per day, and current use of
antidepressants. Using an identical model, we examined
depression-associated mortality among people with and
without diabetes after excluding the insignificant variables
identified above (table 2). When results were controlled for
sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-status variables,
depression played a significant role in mortality risk among
people with diabetes. Compared with respondents with
CES-D scores less than 16, respondents with scores of 16
or higher had death hazards that were increased by 54
percent (p 5 0.004). Although depression slightly increased
hazard ratios among people without diabetes, the relation
was not statistically significant (p 5 0.67). Increased levels
of physical activity and health status significantly reduced
mortality rates in both population groups. Income signifi-
cantly decreased mortality risk among people without
diabetes but not among people with diabetes.

Depression and Mortality in Persons with and without Diabetes 655
Am J Epidemiol 2005;161:652­660
We further examined the relation between depressive
symptoms and mortality by stratifying participants accord-
ing to their CES-D scores (table 2). Using CES-D scores less
than 16 for comparison, we categorized people with CES-D
scores of 16­21 as having moderate depressive symptoms
and those with scores of 22 as having severe depressive
symptoms. Again, depressive symptoms were associated
with increased mortality risk among people with diabetes.
Other things being equal, respondents with moderate de-
pressive symptoms had a hazard ratio that was increased
by 63 percent (p 5 0.016), and respondents with severe
depressive symptoms had a ratio increased by 49 percent
(p 5 0.029). No such relation was found in any subgroup
among people without diabetes (p 5 0.45 and p 5 0.12,
respectively).
We examined the relation again after excluding respon-
dents who died during the first year of follow-up. Moderate
depressive symptoms no longer significantly increased the
risk of mortality among persons with diabetes, whereas
mortality risk remained increased in respondents with
severe depressive symptoms (hazard ratio 5 1.46, 95
percent confidence interval: 1.01, 2.13). Using the same
model, no significant relation between depression and
mortality was found among people without diabetes.
We conducted sensitivity analyses using an enlarged group
of respondents (n 5 8,007), including those who answered
17­19 items on the CES-D questionnaire. We found no
significant difference in depression-associated mortality
between respondents who answered all 20 items and respon-
dents who answered at least 17 items in either the diabetic
population or the nondiabetic population. We also tested for
bias introduced by missing data by including the subsample of
respondents whodidnotprovideanswersforcertainquestions
(the mostcommonly missing data were those related to family
income, where 7.2 percent of the datawere missing). After the
mean value for family income was assigned to these cases, no
significant difference in depression-associated mortality was
found between the subgroup with complete data and the
subgroup with missing data.
DISCUSSION
Using prospective data from the NHEFS, we examined
the relation between depressive symptoms and mortality
among persons with and without diabetes at baseline. Our
findings addressed the following three questions: 1) Do
patients with diabetes have higher levels of depressive
symptoms compared with a healthy population? 2) Do
depressive symptoms significantly increase mortality risk in
general populations as they did in a population with
diabetes? 3) How does diabetes modify the depression-
mortality association? Our findings not only confirm that
people with diabetes are prone to be depressed but also
demonstrate that depressive symptoms play a more impor-
tant role in mortality among people with diabetes than
among people without diabetes. Compared with respondents
with CES-D scores less than 16, respondents with scores of
16 or more had death hazards that were increased by 54
percent. However, no such relation was found among people
without diabetes. We found the same patterns after strati-
fying depressive symptoms and excluding respondents who
had died within the first year of follow-up.
Our findings also demonstrate that diabetes is more
likely to be related not only to worse mental and physical
health but also to a disadvantaged social position. Compared
with nondiabetic people, people with diabetes are more
likely to suffer from depression; to rate their health as
worse; to report more cases of cancer, hypertension, heart
attack, stroke, and blindness; to be physically inactive; to be

Depression and Mortality in Persons with and without Diabetes 657

less well-educated; to have lower incomes; and to be
unemployed.
This is the first study we are aware of that has examined
the relation between depressive symptoms and mortality
among people with and without diabetes using a nationwide
longitudinal follow-up sample. Although many studies
claim that depression elevates humans' susceptibility to
diabetes (4­10) and that depression further deteriorates
diabetic patients' health status by affecting their glycemic
control and their macrovascular and microvascular compli-
cations (13­20), much contradictory evidence also exists (7,
12, 21, 22, 61). By demonstrating a significant relation
between depressive symptoms and excess mortality among
persons with diabetes, this study indicates that an associa-
tion does exist between depression and diabetes.
Using a nondiabetic subgroup as a comparator, this study
design may exclude other potential confounders. After we
controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle,
and health status, our results showed that depression
significantly elevates mortality only among persons with
diabetes. This finding implies that diabetes modifies the
depression-mortality association.
This study also clarifies the relation between depressive
symptoms and mortality among general populations. Pre-
vious studies carried out in restricted populations have
indicated that a relation exists between depression and
excess mortality only when subjects have certain cardio-
vascular illnesses--such as coronary artery disease (42),
myocardial infarction (35, 36, 40), stroke (38, 41), conges-
tive heart failure (39), or ischemic heart disease (37)--or
when subjects have a disadvantaged social position, such as
a low income, less education, or social isolation (43­45).
However, we have not identified any study that uses a
comparison group to examine the relation between de-
pression and mortality. We found that diabetes, similarly to
other chronic diseases, significantly affects the depression-
mortality association. This relation was not observed in the
nondiabetic comparison population. Our findings demon-
strate the importance of examining subgroups, rather than
aggregated populations, when examining the effect of
depression on mortality.
Our study had several strengths. First, the data we used
came from a nationwide longitudinal survey with 10 years
of follow-up. Second, the most important confounding
variables, such as sociodemographic, health-status, and
lifestyle variables, were controlled for when we examined
the relation between depression and mortality. Third, an
identical model was used to analyze two different popula-
tions, and the comparison confirmed a relation between
depressive symptoms and diabetes. Fourth, sensitivity
analyses provided a degree of methodological validity.
Our study also had various limitations. First, depressive
symptoms were measured only at baseline, and the CES-D
scale was used as a time-independent variable in our model.
As a result, any change in depressive symptoms was not
reflected in our survival analysis. Second, baseline charac-
teristics in the diabetic and nondiabetic populations differed,
which decreased the explanatory power of the comparison
model. Third, information on specific causes of death was
not available, and this affected the generalizability of our
findings. Fourth, the diabetic population was identified by
self-report--an approach that may have introduced mis-
classification. However, this methodological approach has
been found to cause only minor bias, with high agreement
between personal interviews and medical records in diabetic
populations (j 5 0.7) (62).
We recognize that our study does not provide a causal
explanation for the relation between depression and excess
mortality. Because the major explanatory variable, CES-D
score, was used as a time-independent variable, our model
more likely demonstrates a valid association. Further in-
vestigation should focus on the mechanism of how de-
pression affects mortality among persons with diabetes.
Two paradigms are available for further investigation of
such mechanisms (5, 63­67); one paradigm relates to
physiology and psychology, and the other relates to health
behavior. Depression and diabetes may be linked by neuro-
hormonal changes mediated through the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis. Depression has been found to in-
crease levels of counterregulatory hormones, particularly
cortisol (66) and catecholamines (64, 65, 67). By activating
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic
nervous system, the counterregulatory hormones related to
depression increase human susceptibility to obesity, insulin
resistance, and type 2 diabetes (5, 63). In addition, de-
pression activates the central sympathetic nervous system
and leads to increased catecholamine levels and subsequent
insulin resistance (5, 63). These physiologic processes may
contribute to morbidity and mortality risk.
Depressive symptoms may be related to health behaviors
associated with diabetes (68). Depressed persons may be
more likely to adopt unhealthy behaviors, such as a seden-
tary lifestyle and a poor diet, which are associated with
a greater likelihood of obesity and type 2 diabetes (68, 69).
Depressed persons may isolate themselves and be less likely
to contact other people, decreasing the availability of social
support, which could be crucial for glycemic control,
treatment compliance, and survival (20, 70, 71).
Our study found an association between diabetes and
depressive symptoms at baseline. Thereafter, depressive
symptoms appeared to play a significant role in elevating
mortality risk among persons with diabetes but not among
persons without diabetes during a 10-year period. Our
findings also help clarify the contradictory findings on the
association between depression and mortality among gen-
eral populations. Depression should probably be considered
a target for diabetes management interventions (72). In
addition, however, more investigation is needed to clarify
the nature and etiology of the interaction between diabetes
and depression.
