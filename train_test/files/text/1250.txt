Overweight Is Associated With Decreased
Cognitive Functioning Among School-age
Children and Adolescents

Objective: Childhood overweight and obesity have increased substantially in the past two decades, raising concerns
about their psychosocial and cognitive consequences. We examined the associations between academic performance
(AP), cognitive functioning (CF), and increased BMI in a nationally representative sample of children.
Methods and Procedures: Participants were 2,519 children aged 8­16 years, who completed a brief
neuropsychological battery and measures of height and weight as a part of the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, a cross-sectional survey conducted between 1988 and 1994. Z-scores were calculated for each
neuropsychological test, and poor performance was defined as z-score <2.
Results: The association between BMI and AP was not significant after adjusting for parental/familial characteristics.
However, the associations between CF remained significant after adjusting for parental/familial characteristic, sports
participation, physical activity, hours spent watching TV, psychosocial development, blood pressure, and serum lipid
profile. Z-scores on block design (a measure of visuospatial organization and general mental ability) among overweight
children and children at risk of overweight were below those of normal-weight children by 0.22 (s.e. = 0.16) and 0.10
(s.e. = 0.10) unit, respectively (P for trend <0.05). The odds of poor performance on block design were 1.97 (95%
confidence interval: 1.01­3.83) and 2.80 (1.16­6.75), respectively, among children at risk or overweight compared to
normal-weight peers.
Discussion: Increased body weight is independently associated with decreased visuospatial organization and
general mental ability among children. Future research is needed to determine the nature, persistence, and functional
significance of this association.

Introduction
The prevalence and severity of overweight is increasing dra-
matically in children and adolescents (1). The short- and long-
term associations between overweight and a range of adverse
health-related outcomes are well established and raise the level
of importancefor understanding overweight as a major public
health concern for children and adolescents. Few studies have
been specifically designed and conducted to examine the asso-
ciation between overweight and cognitive functioning (CF),
possibly because of the general assumption that overweight or
obesity per se is not a primary risk factor for poor cognitive
performance, but merely predisposes or exacerbates other risk
factors for cardiovascular diseases (2). Limited number of stud-
ies have provided some evidence that increased body weight
status per se is associated with lowered CF in men (2,3). It is
less clear whether these findingshold true for children because
of inconsistent conclusion from previous studies. Li observed
that among Chinese elementary school children, severely obese
children had significantly lower intelligence quotient than the
controls (4). Mo-suwan et al. found that an association between
overweight status and poor school performance existed among
Thai children from grades 7 to 9 but not 3 to 6 (ref. 5). However,
Datar et al. concluded that among American kindergartners,
significant differences in test scores by overweight status were
explained by parental education and home environment rather
than overweight status per se (6). These inconsistent findings
may be related to the biosocial complexities of childhood over-
weight, academic performance (AP), and CF. Parental factors,
such as the provision of a stimulating home environment, play
critical roles in the development of overweight, less satisfactory

AP, and poor CF as well. Confounding effects may be part of
the association observed from some studies, whereas in other
studies, over-controlling for some factors, particularly physi-
cal activity and television (TV) watching, for which obesity
may be as much a cause as a consequence, was also a 
concern.
Given the limitations of previous studies, we undertook a
cross-sectional analysis to examine the associations between
AP, CF, and increased BMI while focusing on the mediating or
confounding effects of socioeconomic characteristics, physi-
cal activity, TV viewing, and cardiovascular risk factors among
school-aged children enrolled in the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).
Methods And Procedures
Study population
The NHANES III, conducted from 1988 to 1994, is a cross-sectional
survey of the US noninstitutionalized civilians living in households.
The sampling scheme was a stratified, multistage probability design
with oversampling of African Americans and Mexican Americans
to allow more precise estimates for these subpopulations. Detailed
descriptions of the survey have been published elsewhere (7).
NHANES III included medical and cognitive examinations, and
interviews conducted with survey children and proxy respondents. A
total of 3,903 children aged 8­16 years participated in the AP and CF
test with reliable data collected and English as the test language. As
the primary goal of this study was to examine abnormally increased
body weight, we excluded 163 underweight children (BMI < 5 per-
centile). Forty-four children who were in the neonatal intensive care
unit for >2 weeks and forty-one children in need of special educa-
tion or suffering from a learning disability or health-related impair-
ment were also excluded. A large number of additional children were
excluded because of missing information pertaining to confounder
or mediating factors, e.g., iron test, blood lead (n = 300), parental
and familial socioeconomic status (SES, n = 264), physical activity
and sports participation (n = 129), TV viewing hours (n = 22), tradi-
tional cardiovascular disease risks (n = 412), and psychosocial status
(n = 9). After exclusions, 2,519 children and adolescents remained
for primary analyses.
Measurements and variable definitions
AP/CF. AP/CF was assessed using standardized neuropsychological
tests conducted in the mobile examination center. Trained examiners
administered tests in a standardized environment using uniform pro-
cedures. An automated data-recording system was used to improve
adherence to the protocol, help assure accurate timing of the tasks,
and streamline data collection. The examination consisted of a series
of four tests, including the block-design and digit-span subtests of the
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Revised (WISC-R), and the
reading and arithmetic sections of the Wide Range Achievement Test,
Revised (WRAT-R).
On the block-design test, the child replicates two-dimensional geo-
metric patterns using a set of three-dimensional cubes; this subtest is
a measure of nonverbal reasoning and visuospatial construction. The
digit-span test assesses attention and working memory by asking the child
to repeat a series of increasingly long number of sequences forward and
then backward. The WRAT-R arithmetic test consists of oral and written
problems ranging from simple addition to calculus, whereas the read-
ing test assesses letter recognition and word-reading skills. The WISC-R
block-design and digit-span tests were age-standardized to a mean of 10
with a s.d. of 3 and WRAT-R arithmetic and reading scores were age-
standardized to a mean of 100, with an s.d. of 15 (ref. 7). For this study, a
z-score was calculated for each test using the respective standard mean
and s.d. Thus, for each individual test, a person scoring at the mean of the
sample and another person scoring an s.d. above the mean would have
z-scores of 0 and 1, respectively. In addition to the individual test score,
a global AP/CF indictor was created by summing the z-scores of the four
AP/CF tests and divided by 4.
Overweight and at risk of overweight. Body weight was determined
to the nearest 0.05kg (Toledo 2181 Scale), and height was measured to
the nearest 0.1cm with standardized measuring equipment 
(Holtain
Height Stadiometer). BMI was calculated in kilogram per meter square
and then converted to a sex- and age-specific BMI percentile value
using a computerized formula derived from the 2000 Centers for Dis-
ease Control Growth Charts (8). In accordance with recommendations
of the expert panel on childhood obesity (9), we assigned each partici-
pant to an overweight BMI stratum (95th percentile), an at risk for
overweight BMI stratum (85th to 94th percentile), or a normal BMI
stratum (<85th percentile).
Potential mediating/confounding factors. The NHANES III did not
include measures of parental cognitive ability or the quality of the home
environment. Consequently, we relied on ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American and other eth-
nicities), education (<12 years, high school, college, or higher), marital
status of the family head, family income, and dwelling condition as sur-
rogates. The definitions of these indicators can be found in our previous
publication (10). There is some evidence that watching TV is associated
with a greater likelihood of childhood overweight (11­15). Displace-
ment theory also suggests that as children spend more time watching
TV, they spend lesstime participating in more "valuable" activities, such
as reading and doing homework (16), resulting in adverse effects on AP
and cognitive development. We therefore included a parent-reported
measureof child's TV watching--assessing the total number of hours of
TV watched the previous day. The children were also asked "How many
times per week do you play or exercise enough to make you sweat or
breathehard?" These activities did not exclude school-related involve-
ments such as physical education. The children were classified as being
physically active mostdays of the week if children reported participat-
ing in physical activity at least five times per week as recommended
by the SurgeonGeneral's Report on Physical Activity and Health (17).
A question was also asked concerning the number of sport teams and
exerciseprograms the children participated in within the past year, not
including physical education or gym class. Those who reported playing
on one or more sport teams or exercise programs were classified as a
participation group, otherwise as nonparticipation one.
Blood pressure (BP) has been demonstrated to be linearly associated
with block-design scores and the comobility between high BP and over-
weight is relatively high among children and adolescents (18,19). During
the examination conducted in mobile examination center, the physician
took three BP measurements after the child was quiet and undisturbed
for at least 5 min. The first and fifth Korotkoff sounds were measured
according to the standardized measurement protocols recommended by
the American Heart Association. The average of the second and third BP
measurements was recorded as the final reading for each subject. Total
cholesterol was measured enzymatically and serum triglyceride levels
were measured regardless of the examinee's fasting status. Iron deficiency
has been well known to be associated with poor CF, and high prevalence
of iron deficiency was observed among overweight and obese children
and adolescents (20,21). We used the definitions of iron deficiency pro-
posed by Looker et al. based on laboratory tests of transferrin satura-
tion, free erythrocyte protoporphytin, and serum ferritin (22). A child
was considered iron-deficient if any two of these three values of iron
status were abnormal for age and gender. General health status of a child
was rated by parent or proxy as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.
A dichotomous variable was used to compare children in fair or poor
health with children having excellent, very good, or good health. Anxiety
is known to influence test performance and was measured by heart rate in
a previous study (18). During the NHANES, cognitive tests were admin-
istered with a focus on decreasing subject anxiety. Nevertheless, it may
be that a difference in anxiety level between subjects with various BMI
obesity | VOLUME 16 NUMBER 8 | AUGUST 2008 1811

Behavior and Psychology
contributed to the difference in test performances; therefore, we included
the heart rate as a potential confounder. This study also selected several
indicators derived from parents' or proxy's rating to measure children's
behaviors and social skills: (i) whether the child had ever seen a mental
health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, or psychoanalyst) about
any emotional, mental, or behavioral problems, (ii) whether the child had
ever been suspended, excluded, or expelled from school, (iii) whether the
child was shy and slow to make new friends, and (iv) whether the child
had difficulties getting along with others.
Statistical methods
As recommended by the National Center of Health Statistics, we used
the SUDAAN software (SAS-callable version, 8.0.2; Research Triangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) with appropriate weighting and
nesting variables to produce accurate national estimates adjusting for
the oversampling of specific population groups. We used the linear
regression model as primary adjustment tool to estimate the adjusted
mean z-score on cognitive outcomes for each level of BMI; pairwise
comparisons were performed to assess the statistical difference of
z-score between normal-weight children (referent group) and children
at the risk of overweight, and overweight children. A critical two-sided
P value of 0.05 was used to identify statically significant difference.
To assess the mediating/confounding effects from various factors on
the association between BMI with AP/CF, we conducted mediation

analyses according to the methods discussed by Baron andKenny (23)
and Holmbeck (24). The difference of AP/CF test z-score between BMI
category is reduced when mediating variable or confounder is included
in the model than when not included.As the supplementary analyses,
we also repeated all the regressions described above on all subjects
(N = 3,903) who had valid data of any AP/CF tests to examine potential
biases caused by exclusion of a large portion of the subjects due to vari-
ous reasons. The Bonferroni adjustment was not considered because
of the exploratory nature of the study and creation of the indicator for
global functioning.
Results
The average age of the weighted population was ~12 years,
with subjects divided equally by gender for both included
and excluded groups (Table 1). The subjects included differed

sizes associated with being overweight or at risk of overweight
on the test scores were relatively small. Among all estimates, the
maximum effect size was the age­gender-adjusted difference of
block-design z-scores between normal-weight and overweight
children, which was statistically significant but twice the s.e.
only. The effect size of overweight on block-design test was only
0.22 (s.e. = 0.11) after adjustment for a comprehensive list of
confounding and mediating variables.
When test z-scores were dichotomized and performance with
score below 2 was defined as "poor," the proportions of poor per-
formers were 5.99, 7.45, 6.84, and 5.16, respectively for arithme-
tic, reading, block-design, and digit-span test, and 1.67 for global
functioning (data not shown) among study population. Because
of the reduced statistical power from dichotomizing continuous
variables, the logistic regression yielded a different picture to
that obtained from linear regressions using continuous z-score
as the outcome variable. Among all AP/CF measures, only block
design demonstrated a strong and significant association with
body weight status (Table 3). The proportion of poor performers
on this task was nearly doubled (odds ratio = 1.97) among chil-
dren at risk of overweight and tripled (odds ratio = 2.80) among
significantly from those excluded on most of the character-
istics selected. Compared with participants included, those
excluded were more likely to be non-white and to have a low
family SES. Excluded subjects had low z-scores on all cognitive
tests, high rates of emotional or behavioral problems, and were
more likely to be rated by their parents as having poor health.
Among children included, 20.33 and 15.92% respectively were
identified as overweight or at risk of overweight, significantly
higher than the corresponding proportion among the children
excluded. Finally, the proportion of children participating on
sports teams or programs was also significantly higher among
the group of subjects included.
Estimated from linear regressions (Table 2), the age­
gender-
adjusted trends of the association between BMI and all AP/CF
test were statistically significant, and z-scores of test decreased
as the percentile of BMI increased. The trends of the associa-
tion with AP were quickly diminishing where adjustments were
made for parental and familial SES. The trends for block-design,
digit-span tests and global functioning remained statistically
significant even when the adjustments were further made for all
potentialconfounding/mediatingvariables.Generally,theeffect

impairment in visuospatial organization and general men-
tal ability (as measured via block design) in a large sample of
school-age children. This association remained robust even
after adjusting for parental and familial SES and other poten-
tial confounders such as sports participation, physical activity
level, hours of TV watching, psychosocial development, BP,
and serum lipid profile. There was a suggestion of a "dose­
response" effect of body size on cognition functioning. When
test scores <2 s.d. from mean were defined as "poor," the odds
of poor performance in visuospatial organization and general
mental ability were doubled and tripled, respectively among
overweight children compared to their normal-weight peers.
These estimates were obtained after adjustment for all potential
confounding/mediating variables. Supplementary analyses on all
subjects (N = 3,903) who had valid data of any AP/CF showed
that the estimates remained unchanged and the associations
described above was not sensitive to exclusion of a large portion
of the subjects due to the reasons previously described.

and stroke implicated in the cognitive decline associated with
increased body status, such as low-degree inflammation of blood
vessels in the brain because obesity or overweight has been iden-
tified as a proinflammatory state.
Other mechanisms to explain the declined CF have been sug-
gested, with recent attention being paid to impaired insulin recep-
tor signaling, low levels of leptin in brain, and altered glucose
metabolism (30,31). Physiologically, hyperinsulinemia is linked
to disturbances in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling that
affect several brain regions, including those (e.g., frontal lobes,
hippocampus) involved in planning and organizing, which are
elements of the block-design task. It is unclear whether these
mechanisms may apply to the associations we observed among
children and adolescents overweight or at risk of overweight. It
has been reported, however, that even in the absence of diabetes
mellitus, insulin resistance associated with accelerated 
age-related
cognitivedecline(32­34).Anotherpotentialexplanationisrelated
to the effects of sleep apnea. As is well known, increased BMI is
related to an increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea in children
and adolescents (35). As is true for adults, children with obstruc-
tive sleep apnea have detectable cognitive deficits presumably due
to hypoxemia in addition to the general effects of sleep disrup-
tion (36­39). Some authors have speculated that psychosocial
factors within the family may play a role in both the origins of
obesity and its cognitive consequences (40), and the learning dif-
ficulties and poor cognitive performance present in overweight
children may reflect parental psychopathology or SES rather than
problems that resultfrom the child's increased weight status. This
study demonstrated that controlling for parental SES diminished
the association between overweight and APs but such factors did
not account for poor performance in areas of visuospatial organi-
zation and general mental ability.
Perhaps the greatest limitation of this study was that due to
its cross-sectional design, a causalrelationship between weight
status and AP/CF couldnot be determined. Both weight status
and AP/CF are strongly influenced by genetic factors, and any
observed covariation could have been due to the concomitant
expression of genotype without weight status and AP/CF being
causally related to one another. The samples of the study may
represent only "normal" children, as "abnormal" children who
had been institutionalized or in special schools (classes) were
excluded. Therefore, the ability to identify a strong association
may have been constrained by not sampling those who were
emotionally, cognitively, or behaviorally abnormal. Thanks to
computer technology, the AP/CF tests can be administered in
a carefully controlled fashion with extremely accurate mea-
surement in NHANES III, making this study able to detect the
subtle effects of increased body size on important elements of
neuropsychological functioning. Interpretation requires cau-
tion at this point given the nature of the study design. Our
findings, however, trigger important questions--chief among
them being whether the associations observed in our sample
during childhood lead to larger deficits during adulthood or
make persons more vulnerable to biologic perturbation, and
thus lead to decreased social functioning, and make difference
to survival in later life? Seeking answers to these questions
at risk and overweight children, compared to their normal-
weight peers.
In this study, AP was assessed by WRAT-R, a brief and widely
used instrument designed to measure basic school perfor-
mances rather than comprehension, reasoning, and judgment
processes. Both reading and arithmetic subtests reflect large
part of the social, economic, and cultural knowledge and are
strongly influenced by the parental or familial SES characteris-
tics. This might be the major reason that age­gender-adjusted
effect sizes of weight status were significant but adjustment for
SES reduced these effect sizes substantially to a level without
statistical significance. Our observation is consistent with a
previous study which found that among American kindergart-
ners and first-grade students, overweightwas a marker for but
not a cause of poor AP and that worse AP can contribute to
parent or family SES characteristics (6). It was found, however,
that lower educationalachievement among adults is associated
with obesity and obese adolescents consider themselves worse
students (25). It is unknown whether the findings from adults
apply to children or in instances in which objective measures
of school performance, as we did in this study, are used.
The finding that decreased CF was associated with increased
weight status is consistent with studies demonstrating decre-
ments in memory, abstract reasoning, and attention in adults
with increased body weight. It has been observed that a signifi-
cant portion of obese individuals between the ages of 20 and
64 years reported "some difficulty thinking" (26). Cognitive defi-
cits on tests of motor speed, diminished performance on tests of
motor speed and manual dexterity, and executive function have
been identified among middle-aged and older obese adults (27).
Poor performance on memory tasks is common among obese
individuals across the adult lifespan (28). Admittedly, part of the
association observed among adults is explainable by a reverse
causation. Those with poorer cognitive ability to begin with
may both do worse in school and select a lifestyle (i.e., high TV
watching, poor dietary intake, low physical activity) that pro-
motes weight gain. This study, however, further demonstrated
that this association may exist among overweight children or
children at risk of overweight without clinically diagnosed
diabetes mellitus or the multiple medical comorbidities such
as vascular disease and cardiac disease that often characterize
adult patients. The significant relationship with decreased block-

design subtest captured in both linear and logistic regression was
particularly intriguing. Block design, a measure of visuospatial
organization and general mental ability (29), has been shown
to be sensitive to brain damage, particularly nondominant right
hemisphere lesions with parietal lobe involvement. The impor-
tance of these findings can be judged by noting that the adverse
effects of increased body weight status on cognition functioning
start playing as early as in childhood. The general assumption
does not hold true that increased body status is not a primary
risk factor for poor cognitive performance, but merely predis-
poses or exacerbates other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
Cognitive decline may occur in younger persons without the
pathophysiological vascular changes typically associated with
aging. Indeed, there may be factors other than atherosclerosis

invites further detailed and sustained investigation in large pro-
spective settings with a more comprehensive battery of tests.
Today's schools face intense pressure to focus on standardized
test and consequently have placed less emphasis on the broader
view of a healthy mind in a healthy body. This study provides
additional evidence indicating that physical health and learn-
ing success are interrelated; our education cannot achieve its
mission if children are not healthy and fit physically, mentally,
and socially.
