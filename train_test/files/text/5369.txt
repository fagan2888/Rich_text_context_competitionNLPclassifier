Introduction
The Texas Education Agency (TEA) reported that in 2010
there were 338,191 classroom teachers in Texas. The one
common characteristic shared by all teachers is a teaching
certificate. However, there are differences in certification
type, which arise from the chosen type of state-approved
route to certification that each teacher takes.
In Texas, traditional routes to certification consist of uni-
versity-based non-education programs, university post-bac-
calaureate programs, and out-of-state certification (State
Board of Educator Certification [SBEC]). Traditional routes
to certification involve completing some form or combina-
tion of coursework, field-based experience, and the state-
approved content area exams. For teachers receiving initial
certification in 2010, 54% (15,471) were certified through
traditional certification programs.
Prospective teachers can also choose non-traditional or
alternative certification routes to achieve teaching certifica-
tion. Alternative certification programs were designed to
mitigate teacher shortages as well as fast track interested
individuals into education (Heinen & Scribner, 2009).
Alternative certification programs are expedited programs
that place prospective teachers into the classroom after a
brief introductory training and student support period (Jacobs
& Walsh, 2007). Proponents of alternative certification
programs argue that the benefit of alternative certification
programs is the continuing professional development and
support of beginning teachers, which has been identified as a
key factor in teacher success (National Center for Education
Information [NCEI], 2005).
Once in the classroom, teachers are responsible for the
education of their students and must find the most effective
way to teach them, maintain order, and build relationships
with their students through the use of effective classroom
management techniques (Harrison & Killion, 2007).
Classroom management refers to the design and implemen-
tation of efficient classroom routines, policies, and proce-
dures for participation in class discussions, forming
cooperative learning groups, accomplishing class work, and
various other classroom activities and interactions (Sterling,
2009). Classroom management can determine the success or
failure of teachers and students.

A Comparison of Traditional and
Alternative Certification Routes on
Classroom Management
Brian Uriegas1, Lori Kupczynski2, and Marie-Anne Mundy2
Abstract
In Texas, there are different ways teachers can attain certification. Thus, teachers are entering the classroom through various
certification routes with varying levels of training as the traditional and alternative programs differ in their requirements.
Classroom management can determine the success or failure of teachers and students. The research involved in this study
attempted to determine whether university-certified teachers differ from alternatively certified teachers in the area of
classroom management as determined by referrals, while controlling for level of education, years of teaching experience, age,
race, and gender at both middle and high school levels. The population for this study was the middle and high school teachers
in one rural south central Texas school district. Data were collected from the school district's personnel database as well
as from the campus-level administrators. Hierarchical regressions were used to test null hypotheses and recommendations
were suggested.

2 SAGE Open
Putman (2009) identifies student discipline and classroom
management as areas of anxiety and concern for pre-service
teachers. Schools across the United States are experiencing
all time highs in behavior problems (Abede & HaileMariam,
2007). Principals note that to limit the number of office refer-
rals, teachers must be able to distinguish between what con-
stitutes a discipline infraction as opposed to an issue of
classroom management (Wyatt, 2010). According to Baines
(2006), university-certified teachers outperform alternatively
certified teachers.
The research involved in this study attempted to deter-
mine which factors affect classroom management; more spe-
cifically, whether differences exist between the classroom
management abilities of traditional and alternative certifica-
tion teachers as measured by discipline referrals, while con-
trolling for level of education, years of teaching experience,
age, race, and gender at both middle and high school levels.
As the teaching profession continues to expand, more
research is needed to analyze the effectiveness of certifica-
tion programs.
Review of Literature
The Teacher Center (2004) explains that individuals seek
certification to teach for many reasons, including a feeling of
wanting to have a greater impact on people and the decline of
the business world. For individuals seeking teaching certifi-
cation, there are not only many steps in the process but also
many routes for accomplishing these steps.
The Texas SBEC has established several steps a person
must complete before becoming a certified teacher. First, a
person must hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited col-
lege or university within this requirement is the stipulation
that all teachers must have an academic major as well as
teacher training courses because Texas institutions do not
offer degrees in education. Subsequently, prospective teach-
ers must complete an approved teacher training program,
which can be completed through a college or a university,
school district, regional service center, community college,
or other entity such as an alternative certification program.
Finally, pre-service teachers must complete and pass the
appropriate teacher certification test for the subject and grade
level that they wish to teach (SBEC, 2011).
The TEA has established two final steps a person must
complete, once all other appropriate steps for certification
have been completed, to become a certified teacher in Texas.
First, a person must complete and submit the appropriate
application and fees which are then filed with SBEC. Second,
all first-time teachers in the state of Texas must submit to
fingerprinting as part of a national criminal background
check (TEA, 2010).
Types of Certification
One of the most controversial topics in education today is the
hiring of teachers who were alternatively certified versus
teachers who were certified through a traditional program.
The types of teacher certification differ in terms of the
requirements necessary for certification. Taking an even
closer look at alternative certification versus traditional cer-
tification, one of the biggest differences is the practicum or
field-based experience factor. While the field experience
may not be extensive, teacher preparation programs may uti-
lize intensive field experiences involving reflection and
inquiry that link theories with personal learning experiences
(Capraro, Capraro, & Helfeldt, 2010). For students to benefit
from teachers, certification programs (alternative or tradi-
tional) must ensure that candidates are trained and practice
under quality veterans from the very first day the candidate
sets foot in a classroom (Darling-Hammond, Holtzman,
Gatlin, & Vasquez Heilig, 2005).
Traditional. Traditional teaching certification encompasses a
variety of different methods of obtaining a teaching certifi-
cate through a university. Traditional teaching certification
can be obtained through a university undergraduate program,
a university post-baccalaureate program, or through certifi-
cation earned in another state.According to TEA(2010), uni-
versities offer certification to persons who either have
graduated high school and are entering college seeking a
teaching degree, or who have earned a degree and wish to
become a certified teacher.
Proponents of traditional teacher certification programs
argue that field-based aspects of these programs allow for
teachers to experience more challenges before entering the
teaching world, thereby allowing these teachers to prepare
for the "real world." It has been suggested that the current
university-based system has been best suited to prepare
teachers for the classroom (Lit, Nager, & Snyder, 2010). The
idea that student achievement increases with the level of
classroom experience a teacher has is supported by Buck and
O'Brien's (2005) research findings showing a positive rela-
tionship between teaching experience and teacher effective-
ness (Marszalek & Odom, 2010). In some instances,
traditionally certified teachers and alternatively certified
teachers both performed adequately as a mixed group, but
traditionally trained teachers performed significantly better
in the area of quality student management practices (Brindley
& Parker, 2010).
Alternative certification.Alternative certification has been a
term used for a variety of programs that train and credential
teachers in an expedited manner often by eliminating steps
such as student teaching.
Uriegas et al. 3
In Texas, specifically, alternative certification programs
can come from universities, region service centers, and pri-
vate organizations. While there are many alternative certifi-
cation programs to choose from in Texas, TEA (2010)
provides a set of guidelines and procedures for teachers who
choose to seek certification through an alternative certifica-
tion program. Prospective teachers must determine a grade
level and subject area to teach and choose an approved alter-
native certification program. Once the alternative certifica-
tion program is chosen, the prospective teacher must meet
the required screening criteria of that program, which may
include college grade point average, basic skills, and content
knowledge. The next step in the process is to set a certifica-
tion plan within the respective program.
Some alternative certification programs are self-taught
and simply consist of online modules that must be completed
within a specific time frame during the intern year. Other
alternative certification programs require actual classroom
time with an instructor, while still other alternative certifica-
tion programs consist of a mixture of the two methods.
Another difference that exists between various alternative
certification programs is requirement for internship training.
Some alternative certification programs, usually university
or service center based, allow students to obtain a paid intern-
ship or probationary teaching position based on coursework
progress and the completion of appropriate certification
tests. A student must obtain an eligibility statement from the
program to be employed (TEA, 2010). There are also alter-
native certification programs, such as Texas Teachers, that
will allow a student to accept a paid teaching position almost
immediately after acceptance into the teacher training pro-
gram (TEA, 2010). A candidate will need to secure a teach-
ing assignment at the grade level and in the subject area of
one's target certificate. Once the prospective teacher secures
a teaching position, the prospective teacher will follow the
same process as prospective teachers acquiring certification
through a post-baccalaureate certification program. Upon
completion of the process, the candidate will be a certified
teacher (TEA, 2010).
Some alternative programs are basically traditional pro-
grams under a different name, whereas other programs have
very few admission standards or program requirements
(Baines, 2010). Baines (2010) continues by saying that non-
university-based alternative programs exist in two forms: the
"learn while you earn program," which has an expedited
summer course preceding a full-time teaching position as an
internship year, or the Internet-based programs, which have
no field experience requirement.
There have been benefits from alternative certification
programs, which include work experienced teachers entering
the profession and addressing teaching fields that were con-
sidered critical needs areas (Mikulecky, Shkodriani, &
Wilner, 2004). One of the central beliefs of the alternative
certification programs is that continuous professional devel-
opment and support offered to first-year teachers through
these programs is more beneficial than a semester of class-
room experience with no follow-up support or extension
(NCEI, 2005).
Classroom management has been one of the areas where
alternatively certified teachers have struggled. The biggest
issues first-year alternatively certified teachers deal with are
time and the managing of students (Samaras & Wilcox,
2009). In addition, alternatively certified teachers struggle
with student achievement as students who had university-
certified teachers outperformed students from alternatively
certified teachers (Baines, 2006).
Method
Teacher demographic data were collected through the
studied rural south central Texas school district's Human
Resource department. A spreadsheet containing teachers'
level of education and years of teaching experience, age,
race, and gender on the district's five middle school and
three high school campuses was provided. All identifiable
information was removed for confidentiality purposes. A
printout of all discipline data in the Internet-based Texas
Computer Cooperative System (iTCCS) were obtained
from each campus administrator or Public Education
Information Management System (PEIMS) clerk. Teacher
demographic data, including age, gender, ethnicity, years
of experience, and degree earned, and the number of dis-
cipline referrals written by each teacher were captured
into a Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)
file.
The researchers input the dependent variable, classroom
management as measured by discipline referrals. This was
chosen as the sole dependent variable because of the lack of
information pertaining to discipline referrals in the literature.
The use of only discipline referrals as the dependent variable
is a limitation of the study. The researchers do acknowledge
that discipline referrals are only one aspect of classroom
management that may affect instruction.
Once this variable was input, the researchers created the
block of covariates: level of education, years of teaching
experience, age, race, and gender for teachers at the middle
school level and high school levels, individually. The
researchers then added the remaining variable: route to
teacher certification. The purpose of this was to discover
how much variance this variable accounted for.
Results
For this study, 232 middle school teachers were examined;
demographic data for these teachers can be found in
4 SAGE Open
Table 1. Also analyzed was the mean number of discipline
referrals written by the combined (M = 5.54) and by each of
the traditional (M = 5.62) and alternative (M = 5.27) routes
(Table 2).
Entry of the demographic variables of degree, age, gen-
der, ethnicity, and years of experience accounted for 3.3%
of the variance (R2) in the subjects' discipline referrals.
Entry of the certification variable resulted in an R2 change
of .001, thus entry of the certification variable increased the
explained variance in the subjects discipline referrals by
0.1% to a total of 3.4%. This increase was not significant as
evidenced by the F change test, F(1, 225) = 0.30, p = .59
(Table 3). The results suggest that when adding the variable
of certification to the demographic variables, there was no
significant effect on the number of discipline referrals that
were written.
The ANOVA represented in Table 4 shows that entry of
the set of demographic variables alone yielded an insignifi-
cant prediction equation, F(5, 226) = 1.56, p = .172.Addition
of the certification variable resulted in an overall insignifi-
cant equation, F(6, 225) = 1.35, p = .28. There were no
significant differences between the number of discipline
referrals that were written for the traditional route (M =
5.62, SD = 6.90) and the alternative route (M = 5.27, SD =
6.05).
Similarly, 281 high school teachers were examined;
demographic data can be found in Table 5. Also analyzed
were the mean number of discipline referrals written by the
combined (M = 5.86) and by each of the traditional (M =
6.01) and alternative (M = 4.92) routes (Table 6).
Entry of the demographic variables of degree, age, gen-
der, ethnicity, and years of experience accounted for 1.7% of
the variance (R2) in the subjects' discipline referrals. Entry
of the certification variable resulted in an R2 change of .003,
thus entry of the certification variable increased the
explained variance in the subjects discipline referrals by
0.3% to a total of 2.0%. This increase was not significant as
evidenced by the F change test, F(1, 267) = 0.78, p = .38
(Table 7). The results suggest that when adding the variable
of certification to the demographic variables, there was no
significant effect on the number of discipline referrals that
were written.
The ANOVA represented by Table 8 shows that entry of
the set of demographic variables alone yielded an insig-
nificant prediction equation, F(5, 268) = 0.94, p = .46.
Addition of the certification variable resulted in an overall
insignificant equation, F(6, 267) = 0.91, p = .49, this
resulted in no significant difference between the number of
discipline referrals written by the traditional route (M =
6.01, SD = 9.70) and by the alternative route (M = 4.92,
SD = 7.56).
This study sought to examine the differences in the num-
ber of discipline referrals written and whether those numbers
were affected by the type of teacher certification program.
Secondary teachers at three high school and five middle
schools in one south central Texas school district were
selected as the focus of this study.
Analyzing the number of discipline referrals indicated
that teachers who achieved certification through a tradi-
tional certification program did not have a significant
advantage in terms of classroom management at both the
middle school and high school levels while holding con-
stant teachers' age, gender, certification type, ethnicity,
level of education, and years of experience. The result of
the addition of the certification variable yielded no signifi-
cant effect on the number of discipline referrals written
throughout the school year as evidenced by comparing the
means of discipline referrals written by traditionally certi-
fied middle school teachers (M = 5.62, SD = 6.90) with
alternatively certified middle school teachers (M = 5.27, SD
= 6.05), and by traditionally certified high school teachers
(M = 6.01, SD = 9.70) with alternatively certified high
school teachers (M = 4.92, SD = 7.56). In addition, the

effect sizes yielded negligible results as evidenced by the
0.1% for middle school teachers and 0.3% for high school
teachers.
The results support the notion that alternative certification
programs have many benefits, which include work experi-
enced teachers entering the profession, addressing teaching
fields that were considered critical needs area, and combat-
ing the general teacher shortages around the nation
(Mikulecky et al., 2004).
In summary, examining the effects of certification type
on the number of discipline referrals written by secondary
teachers in a rural south central Texas school district
found that there were no significant differences or effects.
The results of this study yielded no proof that traditional
certification programs more adequately prepare future
teachers in the area of classroom management as mea-
sured by discipline referrals. Teachers, regardless of their
certification routes, hone their craft with age and experi-
ence. In addition, circumstances such as previous career
and life experiences may be beneficial to teachers who
achieved certification through alternative certification
programs. For administrators and human resource person-
nel, the results of this study suggest that hiring practices
should not attempt to avoid alternatively certified teachers
as there is no significant difference in the ability to man-
age a classroom when comparing alternatively certified
teachers with traditionally certified teachers. Additional
research should be done to determine the effects of certi-
fication type on student achievement and teacher
retention.
