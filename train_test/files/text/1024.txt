Objectives. This report examines the role of (a) disease processes affecting vision, (b) reported troubles with vision, (c)
physical symptoms affecting the eyes, and (d) objective measures in reported driving limitation due to problems with
eyesight among older drivers.
Methods. Data for this study (N ¼ 1,840) were obtained from participants in a community-based study of aging and
physical performance in people age 55 or older in the city of Sonoma, California. Each of 16 visual conditions was
assessed for impact on reported driving limitation due to eyesight by calculating a ``risk'' ratio. Then, prevalence of the
condition was combined with the ratio to generate an attributable risk for that condition for vision-related limitations in
driving.
Results. Each condition was significantly associated with reported limitations in driving due to eyesight. ``Avoiding
physical activity due to vision'' (ratio ¼ 3.4) and ``trouble seeing steps up/down stairs'' (ratio ¼ 2.9) had the strongest
association. However, ``glasses/contacts required for driving'' and ``trouble with glare from sun/lights'' had the highest
attributable risks (35.8 and 29.4).
Discussion. The risk ratio is relevant for evaluating individuals; the attributable risk is relevant to planning
countermeasures in populations. Addressing specific problems related to vision should substantially reduce driving
limitations due to eyesight.
AMONG older adults, increased age is associated with
reduced and modified driving behavior (Ball, Owsley,
Stalvey, Roenker, Sloane, & Graves, 1998; Gilhotra, Mitchell,
Ivers, & Cummings, 2001; McGwin, Chapman, & Owsley,
2000; Stewart, Moore, & Marks, 1993; West et al., 1997).
There is also evidence that women are more likely to stop
driving (Campbell, Bush, & Hale, 1993; Stewart et al., 1993)
and that reductions in driving are associated with greater
depressive symptoms (Fonda, Wallace, & Herzog, 2001;
Marottoli et al., 1997).
Problems with vision represent one of the leading chronic
conditions associated with reduction in or cessation of driving.
Vision difficulties have been assessed in a variety of ways that
include diagnosed conditions and performance on visual tests.
Older drivers with cataracts and other vision difficulties are
more likely to restrict their own driving and to be involved in
motor vehicle crashes (Dellinger, Sehgal, Sleet, & Barrett-
Connor, 2001; Lyman, McGwin, & Sims, 2001; Owsley,
Stalvey, Wells, & Sloane, 1999; Owsley, Stalvey, Wells,
Sloane, & McGwin, 2001). Reduced performance on standard-
ized visual assessments is also associated with a reduction in
driving in older adults (Ball et al., 1998; Gallo, Rebok, &
Lesikar, 1999; Gilhotra et al., 2001; Marottoli & Richardson,
1998; McGwin, Sims, Pulley, & Roseman, 2000; Sims,
Owsley, Allman, Ball, & Smoot, 1998; Stutts, 1998).
There is less research on self-reported vision problems or
symptoms associated with limitations or avoidance of driving
among older drivers (Dellinger et al., 2001; West, Gildengorin,
Haegerstrom-Portnoy, Lott, Schneck, & Brabyn, 2003). A
better understanding of the barriers to driving associated with
visual deficiencies experienced by older drivers is needed. This
would demonstrate the extent to which a limitation or cessation
of driving is due to a loss of confidence in the ability to drive
and, if so, the extent to which problems with vision contribute
to a loss of confidence. Moreover, research in this area should
contribute to the development of strategies to extend safe
driving years for older adults.
In a previous study of older adults in Sonoma, California,
current drivers were much more likely to identify problems
with eyesight as a reason for limiting their driving than any
other medical condition (Ragland, Satariano, & MacLeod,
2004). The current report expands on that study, examining the
role of (a) disease processes affecting vision, (b) reported
troubles with vision, (c) physical symptoms affecting the eyes,
and (d) objective vision tests in reporting limitations to driving
because of vision.
METHODS
Subjects
The Study of Physical Performance and Age-Related
Changes in Sonomans (SPPARCS) is a community-based
longitudinal study of age-related changes in physical function-
ing, physical activity, and fitness among people age 55 and
older that reside in and near the city of Sonoma, California. A
community-based census identified 3,057 eligible individuals,
of whom 68.4% (2,085) agreed to participate in the study. The
sample was enrolled between May 1993 and December 1994
and included 1,243 women and 842 men; the median age was
70 years with ages ranging from 55 to 97 years.

Based on the 1990 U.S. Census of residents in Sonoma,
California, ages 55 and older, the original sample of 2,085
subjects overrepresented adults ages 65­73 years (41.3% vs.
38.8% in the general population of Sonoma) and underrepre-
sented adults over age 85 years (7.3% vs. 8.7%). Although
differences existed between eligible participants and non-
participants, the differences do not suggest a consistent pattern
with respect to functional disability and chronic illness
(Satariano, Smith, Swanson, & Tager, 1998).
The study sample is also somewhat more affluent and educated
than the population of Sonoma residents age 55 and older.
Nevertheless, a comparison of the sample with California resi-
dents age 55 and older indicates that the only residents who were
underrepresented in the sample were those with household in-
comes less than $10,000. Similarly, the modal income category
of our sample ($25,000­49,000) is the same as the modal income
category for the entire state. Finally, there is very little difference
among Sonomans or Californians in the percentage of house-
holds with annual incomes of $50,000 or more.
The current analysis is based on data from the baseline
assessment of the SPPARCS cohort. The sample was restricted
to subjects who were current drivers who reported whether or not
they had personally either limited or avoided driving (N¼1,840).
Driving status was established from the participants' report of
their driving behavior and driver license history. Driving status
was determined by the participants' answer to three separate
questions: (a) Have you ever had a valid driver's license? (b) Do
you currently have a driver's license? (c) Have you driven a car
in the last 6 months? Participants were considered ``current''
drivers if they responded ``yes'' to all three questions. Current
drivers were distributed across three age groups: 29.4% were
55­64, 45.0% were 65­74, and 25.7% were 75þ.
Reasons for Limiting or Avoiding Driving
Participants also reported driving limitation for a series of 14
common medical reasons (including a physician's recommen-
dation and a family member's recommendation) and 7 common
nonmedical reasons. Driver limitation or avoidance was asked
in the following way: ``Do you currently limit or avoid any of
your driving (either before or after dark) for any of the
following reasons?'' The participant could respond by in-
dicating ``yes,'' ``no,'' or ``don't know'' to each of 21 specific
reasons (14 medical and 7 nonmedical; see Appendix.)
Vision Assessments, Conditions, and Symptoms
Subjects indicated if use of corrective lenses was required for
driving. Visual acuity was measured using the Smith­
Kettlewell Institute Low Luminance (SKILL) Card. The score
from the SKILL Card Test, which is dichotomous (i.e., within
normal limits, not within normal limits), is calculated based
on high-contrast and low-contrast visual acuity performance.
The parameters (i.e., normal, abnormal limits) are based
on conservative age norms. Scores show a linear increase for
ages older than 50. It is a particularly sensitive measure for
reduced visual function that results from certain visual impair-
ments (e.g., optic neuritis, glaucoma, or maculopathy), some of
which are age related. In older populations, the test has also
demonstrated a strong correspondence with driving perfor-
mance. Also, test repeatability has proven as good as the
standard Snellen Acuity Test (Haegerstrom-Portnoy, Brabyn,
Schneck, & Jampolsky, 1997; Haegerstrom-Portnoy, Schneck,
Lott, & Brabyn, 2000; Schneck & Haegerstrom-Portnoy, 2003).
From a list of 30 separate medical conditions, participants
reported whether they had ever received a diagnosis. Vision-
related diseases, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and
macular degeneration were selected for this analysis. Addition-
ally, participants indicated the presence of symptoms or
problems within a 30-day period. Vision-related symptoms in-
cluded watery eyes, dry eyes, and runny or itchy eyes. Vision-
related problems included focusing, recognizing at distance,
seeing up or down stair steps, seeing through glare from the sun
or lights, reading street signs at night, experiencing constricted
peripheral vision, and judging distances.
Analysis
For each of the 16 eyesight-related conditions (diseases,
symptoms, problems, and objective measures), the impact on
reported driving limitations due to problems with eyesight was
determined by calculating a risk ratio of (a) the percent re-
porting a limitation when the condition was present to (b) the
percent reporting a limitation when the condition was absent.
The significance level of this association was calculated using
a chi-square statistic.
Prevalence of the condition was then combined with the risk
ratio to generate an attributable risk for that condition, that is, the
impact in the population. The population attributable risk (PAR)
is the proportion of the outcome (in this case, driving limitations
due to vision) that can be attributable to the exposure (in this
case, specific vision-related disease, condition, or symptom).
This can be calculated as a percentage (PAR%) as follows:
PAR% ¼ (Ppop
À Punexp
)/Ppop
3 100. Ppop
is the percentage of
those in the total population reporting limitations in driving
because of vision, and Punexp
is the percentage of those in the
``unexposed'' group (i.e., those without the specific vision-
related disease, condition, or symptom) who report limitations
in driving because of vision. As an example, the overall per-
centage of those reporting limitations in driving due to vision
(Ppop
) is 25.4. The percentage of those reporting limitations in
driving due to vision that do not report cataracts (Punexp
) is 19.6.
The formula above yields a PAR% of 22.8 (Last, 2001).
RESULTS
Nearly 47% (46.8%, 861/1,840) of the current drivers report
that they currently limit or avoid driving for one or more
reasons. Problems with vision were the leading self-reported
reason for driving limitation or avoidance, especially for
women (Table 1). The percent of participants reporting this
reason also increased with age for both men and women.
Approximately 40% of the women age 75 and older cited vision
problems compared with about 29% of the men in the same age
group. The significance of vision problems is also demonstrated
by examining the percent of medical reasons with involvement
of vision. For women age 75 and older, problems with vision
constituted nearly 84% of all medical reasons cited for
limitations in driving. For men, this figure was nearly 75%.
Table 2 gives (a) the prevalence of each of the 16 vision-
related conditions, (b) the percent reporting vision-related
limitations in driving for those with and without the condition,
(c) the ratio of these percents, and (d) the attributable risk

conditions vary widely in prevalence, from a low of 3.4%
(trouble with peripheral vision) to a high of 57.9% (glasses/
contacts required for driving).
For each of the 16 vision-related conditions, the risk ratios
are all positive and statistically significant. The ratios range
from a low of 1.2 (SKILL Test for visual acuity) to a high of 3.4
(avoid physical activity due to vision).
The attributable risk for each of the vision-related conditions
is a function of the prevalence of the condition as well as the
ratio. Glasses/contacts required for driving has the highest
attributable risk (35.8%), having a moderately high ratio of
association (2.0) but a very high prevalence (57.9%).
DISCUSSION
In a previous study reported by this group, older drivers (age
55þ) were much more likely to identify problems with eyesight
as a reason for limiting their driving than any other medical
condition (Ragland et al., 2004). In this report, we have shown
that specific conditions related to vision (disease processes
affecting vision, objective vision tests, reported troubles with
vision, and physical symptoms affecting the eye) are each
associated, to varying degrees, with reported limitations in
driving due to vision. We have calculated the impact of each of
the factors in two different ways: (a) as an association of each
of the vision-related conditions to reported limitations due to
eyesight and (b) as an attributable risk. The ratio of percent
reporting limitations among those with and without a specific
condition related to vision is relevant to evaluating individuals
with that condition; the attributable risk is relevant to planning
countermeasures in populations (Rose, 1985). We will discuss
the relevance of both measures for each of the types of vision-
related conditions.
Specific Implications of the Findings
For the set of disease processes affecting vision, the ratios of
the association with vision-related limitations in driving were

VISION AND LIMITATIONS OF DRIVING S283
fairly high (1.9 and above). For individuals with these diseases
(cataracts, glaucoma, and macular degeneration), the impact on
driving is an important consideration, and ways to mitigate this
impact should be developed. For example, there is evidence
that cataract surgery reduces crash risk associated with cataracts
(Owsley et al., 1999). Although the degree of association is
similar for the three diseases, cataracts had the highest impact in
terms of attributable risk, as the prevalence of that condition is
substantially higher than that for the other two diseases.
Because so few participants reported having diabetic retinop-
athy, it was not included in this analysis.
Standardized measures of visual capacity recorded in this
study show a different pattern. The ratio of association for the
SKILL Test is very low (1.2), showing that this measure of
visual acuity under light and dark conditions is not very
relevant for vision-related limitations of driving. Other
standardized measures of vision, such as the Useful Field of
Vision, although not assessed in the current study, may be more
appropriate for assessing visual capacity for driving (Owsley et
al., 2001). Glasses/contacts required for driving had a relatively
high ratio of association (2.0). One possibility is that needing
glasses/contacts is a marker for other vision-related problems.
Another possibility is that some proportion of glasses/contacts
are not well prescribed or well suited for the complex and
varied visual tasks associated with driving. It may be that
glasses/contacts could be designed to reduce vision-related
driving limitations. This might be an effective strategy from not
only an individual perspective but also a population viewpoint,
as the prevalence and subsequently the attributable risk are high
(57.9% and 35.8%, respectively).
The eight reported troubles with vision all had a high ratio of
association with vision-related limitations in driving (ranging
from 2.2 to 3.4). Most of these have specific implications with
respect to driving. For example, problems with focusing, depth,
glare, peripheral vision, and nighttime vision might be correct-
able. These same problems might be addressed by highway
design through modification of signs, signals, highway markings,
and lighting. The Federal Highway Administration has published
a Highway Design Handbook (Staplin, Lococo, Byington, &
Harkey, 2001) that has recommendations addressing some of
these issues. Work is needed to extend and implement these
recommendations. A consideration of prevalence and subsequent
attributable risk of these problems might be used to judge the
relative benefits of addressing particular troubles with vision. For
example, trouble with glare from sun/lights and trouble reading
street signs at night have the highest attributable risk and could be
addressed by changes in signs and lighting.
Physical symptoms affecting the eyes (i.e., watery eyes, dry
eyes, and runny/itchy eyes) showed very low ratios of
association with vision-related limitations in driving; and even
though the prevalence of these symptoms was relatively high,
the attributable risks were also fairly low.
General Relevance of Vision to Driving
In general, findings support previous reports that difficulties
with vision are highly associated with increased age and
modified or avoidant driving behavior in older adults. However,
unlike other studies, this study examined specific types of
symptoms and difficulties with vision in association with
vision-related driving limitations.
The significance of vision to driving behavior is not
surprising as it has been estimated that 90% of driver in-
formation is acquired through the visual system (Bailey &
Sheedy, 1988). Early vision (here defined to include the ocular
media and the retinal transduction and processing) plays
a significant role in driving-related tasks as it interacts with
higher cognitive functions in crucial skills such as spatial
judgment, timely initiation of motor responses, and attention.
Older adults are at risk for a variety of decreased functioning
within the eye. With age, the eye changes in several ways,
leading to several effects. The lens loses elasticity, decreasing
the ability to focus, and it yellows, affecting light sensitivity
and acuity. Older adults are also more prone to difficulty with
``light scatter'' within the eye due to either cataracts, corneal
opacity, or vitreous defects, which cause problems with glare
(Babizhayev, 2003). The pupil of the eye becomes smaller with
advanced age, losing ability to allow light in with a consequent
reduction of both visual acuity and sensitivity. Also, many
retinal disorders that affect acuity and peripheral vision are
associated with increased age (Bailey & Sheedy, 1988).
Although there are a number of independent dimensions of
visual capacity, problems with glare and night vision are the
two symptoms most likely to be associated with an older
person's decision to reduce or avoid driving (Theeuwes,
Alferdinck, & Perel, 2002). It is possible to enumerate a list
of age-related visual conditions, defects, and diseases associ-
ated with either glare or night vision deficiencies (Babizhayev,
2003). Some of these are relatively rare, whereas others are
more frequently encountered.
To confirm these results, future studies are needed to
interview older drivers and former drivers about the sequence
of events that led to a decision to reduce or avoid driving and, in
particular, the extent to which problems with glare and night
vision contributed to that decision (Dellinger et al., 2001;
Theeuwes et al., 2002; West et al., 2003). It will be important to
assess the independent and joint effects of a variety of factors
that may operate in conjunction with vision, especially types and
levels of cognitive function, to affect driving decision making
and performance. It may be that levels of self-efficacy or con-
fidence in the ability to drive represent a possible pathway
between visual capacity, health status, and driving behavior.
There is a growing body of research that suggests that self-
efficacy is strongly associated with daily functioning in a variety
of areas, including driving (Dobbs, 2003; Seeman, Unger,
McAvay, & Mendes de Leon, 1999). Although self-efficacy was
not assessed in the current study, future research in this area will
contribute to a better understanding of the effects of vision prob-
lems on self-efficacy associated with driving in this population.
If these results are confirmed in such studies, clinical and
public health strategies to prevent or reduce the effects of these
problems should be considered. There is a positive societal
benefit that results from retaining the mobility of individuals
of advanced age, provided that this can be done without
compromising their safety or the safety of others. Strategies
range from those taken at a societal level (e.g., headlight
regulations that lessen glare to the oncoming driver, signage
character size and illumination at night, and licensure require-
ments) to those undertaken by individuals (e.g., decision to
undergo cataract surgery, decision to forgo refractive surgery,
scrupulous maintenance of vehicle windscreen clarity). Beyond
SATARIANO ET AL.

such strategies, there are varieties of promising infrastructure
improvements under study that can become sensory extensions
for drivers. These include in-vehicle machine vision capabilities,
smart signals and signs, and infrastructure communications to
vehicles and their drivers that complement the sensory
capabilities of drivers. Finally, as noted previously, it will
be important to determine whether changes in self-efficacy
represent a possible pathway between these interventions and the
timing, location, and quality of driving performance in older
populations.
