Abstract
The paper explores the investment behaviour of German firms in the context of the Q-
approach, which plays a dominant role in empirical investment research. The analysis is
based on the Deutsche Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet statistics. The panel data set
contains some 2,300 German firms' balance sheet data covering the years 1988-1998.
While the Q-theory is mainly applied on the basis of stock market data, which facilitates
the exploitation of market expectations and the calculation of average Q, the direct
forecasting approach (Chirinko 1993) suggested by Abel and Blanchard (1986) and
extended to panel data by Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995, 1998) enables the Q-theory to
be applied to non-quoted firms which are by far the majority in Germany.
One of the key variables when using balance sheet data, which has attracted much detailed
research, is firms' net capital stock at replacement costs. The challenge is to transform
historical cost data, depreciated at non-economic, tax-oriented depreciation rates, into
unreported and probably unknown economically meaningful data at actual replacement
values. We suggest a complex procedure for calculating reliable replacement values of a
firm's capital stock.
To calculate Q we follow two different operationalisation strategies. First we estimate
average Q based on balance sheet data by forecasting the present value of future profits
using a VAR model. Second, we estimate marginal Q following the approach suggested by
Gilchrist and Himmelberg. We compare the results from two different estimation
techniques for dynamic investment models, GMM and direct bias correction.
The results show that marginal as well as average Q influence investment significantly.
When classifying the firms by size, we find that smaller firms react more strongly to Q
and, to a lesser extent, to lagged investment.

Zusammenfassung
Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht das Investitionsverhalten deutscher Unternehmen im
Rahmen der Q-Theorie, die eine der dominierenden Investitionstheorien darstellt.
Grundlage der geschätzten Investitionsfunktionen ist die Unternehmensbilanzstatistik der
Deutschen Bundesbank. Der Paneldatensatz umfasst über 2300 Unternehmen und den
Zeitraum 1988 bis 1998.
Die übliche Verwendung von Aktienkursen zur Berechnung des durchschnittlichen Q
beschränkt die Anwendung der Q-Theorie auf börsennotierten Unternehmen. Die explizite
Modellierung eines Prognosemodells (direct forecasting appraoch, Chirinko (1993)) in
Anlehnung an Arbeiten von Abel and Blanchard (1986) und Gilchrist and Himmelberg
(1995, 1998) ermöglicht die Anwendung auch für nicht börsennotierte Unternehmen, die in
Deutschland eindeutig dominieren.
Eine zentrale Größe der Analyse des Investitionsverhaltens auf der Grundlage von
Unternehmensbilanzdaten ist der Kapitalstock der Unternehmen zu Wiederbeschaffungs-
kosten anstelle des bilanziellen Nettoanlagevermögens zu historischen Anschaffungs-
kosten. In der Arbeit wird ein komplexer Algorithmus zu einer möglichst exakten
Schätzung vorgeschlagen.
Zur Berechnung von Q werden zwei unterschiedliche Operationalisierungsstrategien
verfolgt. Zum einen wird in Anlehnung an Abel und Blanchard das durchschnittliche Q
über eine Schätzung des Marktwertes des Eigenkapitals mittels eines Vektor-
Autoregressiven-Modells für Paneldaten ermittelt. Zum anderen wird auf dem Ansatz von
Gilchrist and Himmelberg beruhend eine Abschätzung des marginalen Q vorgenommen.
Die Ergebnisse der Q-Investitionsfunktionen werden für zwei alternative Schätztechniken,
GMM und eine direkte Biaskorrektur, verglichen.
Es zeigt sich, dass sowohl das durchschnittliche als auch das marginale Q die Investitionen
in signifikantem Ausmaß beeinflussen. Die Analyse für Größenklassen zeigt, dass im
wesentlichen kleinere Unternehmen in stärkerem Maße auf Q und in geringerem Maße auf
zeitlich verzögerte Investitionen reagieren.

1. Introduction
The determinants of firms' investment spending have been the focus of academic research
for several decades. Improving the foundations of investment theory as well as the policy
implications is a most interesting objective. Investment spending is known to be very
volatile and therefore one of the driving forces of macroeconomic activity.
In empirical research on investment several approaches have been used (see for an
overview Chirinko 1993). One important approach are so called Q models (Tobin 1969).1
Q models of investment are attractive in several respects. Theoretically the Q-model can be
derived explicitly from an optimization problem which the firm faces when deciding about
new investments.2 Under quite strong assumptions, a linear relationship can be derived
between the ratio of investment to the capital stock and a measure of Q. Theoretically Q is
a sufficient statistic for determining the investment decision if the capital market is
perfect.3
When using balance sheet data for an empirical analysis of firms' investment decisions
researchers face the problem of non-adequate concepts for several variables. The
measurement concepts underlying the balance sheet data often do not match the economic
meaning that interests the researcher. One of the key variables which has attracted much
detailed research is firms' net capital stock at replacement costs. The challenge is to
transform historical cost data depreciated at non-economic, tax-oriented depreciation rates
into unreported and probably unknown economically meaningful data at actual
replacement values. First of all, therefore, we use a complex procedure for calculating
reliable replacement values of a firm's capital stock.4
The second problem is that no stock prices are available for non-quoted firms, which
makes it impossible to follow the usual approach when applying the Q-theory of using
stock market data to calculate the market value of equity. The problem is circumvented by
using a vector-autoregressive approach (VAR) for panel data to estimate the present
values of the future returns on capital in order to calculate Q. This direct forecasting
approach, as Chirinko (1993) named it, is based on a VAR forecasting model and was first
suggested by Abel and Blanchard (1986) for aggregate times series. This approach was
extended in the context of the Q-theory by Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995, 1998) to panel
* We would like to thank Heinz Herrmann for his support and helpful comments.

whether they are based on share prices or on values gained by direct forecasting systems.

cost) model with the same data set used in this paper.

data. The advantage of this direct forecasting approach is that it enables the Q-theory to be
applied to non-quoted firms as well.
In our study we follow two different operationalisation strategies. First we estimate an
average Q comparable to Tobin's Q by forecasting future profits using a VAR-model along
the lines of Abel and Blanchard. Second, we estimate marginal Q following the approach
suggested by Gilchrist and Himmelberg, which is based on a restrictive formulation of the
underlying production process.
The results show a very strong influence of the calculated average as well as marginal Q on
investment for a large panel of German firms. Therefore, we find that the Q-theory is well
suited for application to non-quoted firms on the basis of balance sheet data using a direct
forecasting approach.
2. Theoretical considerations
The economic models of business fixed investment can broadly be classified into two
classes of models.5 The distinguishing feature is whether or not the models explicitly take
account of the process of adjustment of the capital stock. In both classes of models the
optimal level of the firms capital stock results as the solution of the profit maximization
problem. But where the class of older models (Jorgensen (1963, 1971)) does not explain
the optimal path of adjustment of the actual capital stock to the optimal one, the second
class of models explicitly derives the optimal evolution of the capital stock from the
underlying optimization problem. The difference therefore can be seen in the step from the
static problem of optimal factor demand to dynamic investment models. This step can be
performed either by ad hoc specifications or by an explicit derivation of the adjustment
path undertaken in the investment models based on the Q-theory .
Naturally, this advantage is achieved by making strong assumption about the costs of
adjusting the capital stock, which leads to a rationalization of the observed slow
adjustment. In most cases the costs of adjustment are assumed to be strictly convex in the
amount of investment what implies increasing marginal costs. Therefore deviations
between the actual and the optimal capital stock will be reduced through a sequence of
smaller investments rather than through a one-time large change in the capital stock. The
costs of adjustment can be thought of as installation costs or costs caused by the
disruptions of the production process when new investment is undertaken.
In the following the Q-model including an explicit formulation of the adjustment costs is
illustrated. In the basic Q-model the firm faces the following maximization problem:

The firm is assumed to maximize the expected value of the sum of discounted profits t

given the state of information  at time t.
The discount factor between period t and period t + j is denoted by j
t+
 and is assumed to
be the product of the single-period discount rates:

The output is given by the amount of production F minus the lost output G caused by
adjusting the capital stock. The firm is assumed to be producing on the basis of the given
capital stock Kt while other factors of production Lt, mainly labour, are assumed to be
adjusted instantaneously. The function of adjustment cost G is assumed to be strictly
convex in investment and to be additively separable from the gross production function.
If asset markets are efficient in the sense that assets are valued at the expected present
value of the associated income streams, then the value of the firm's capital stock Vt is the
stock market value of the firm when abstracting from other assets beside the capital stock.
The maximization problem the firm faces can therefore be expressed as a dynamic
programming problem.
Using the first-order derivatives of the maximization problem it can be shown that, in
equilibrium, the ratio of the shadow value to the replacement cost (which includes the
adjustment costs) of an additional unit of capital should be one.
Assuming that markets are competitive, the firm is a price taker in all markets, and the
ratio of the shadow value of capital in period t to the price of a unit of investment is known
as marginal Q.
To derive a linear relation between marginal Q and investment, some rather restrictive
assumptions have to be made concerning the adjustment cost function. If a quadratic
adjustment cost function is assumed for mathematical convenience (Summers 1981), it can
be shown that marginal adjustment costs increase linearly with the rate of investment and
that the rate of investment is a linear function of marginal Q.
So far only marginal Q has been analysed. Following Hayashi (1982) it is also possible to
derive a linear relation between average Q and investment. To derive a simple relation
between marginal Q and average Q it is necessary to assume, besides perfect capital and
product markets, that the production function ( )

that the production function has constant returns to scale.
3. The data source
The empirical analysis is based on the Deutsche Bundesbank' corporate balance sheet
statistics.6 This data base covers about 50,000 to 70,000 enterprises each year, which
represent about 4% of the total number of enterprises in Germany. In the context of its
rediscount lending operations the Bundesbank collects the financial statements of firms
using trade bills to assess the creditworthiness of bill-presenting firm.7
Because the sample is biased towards larger enterprises, it covers about 75% of the total
turn-over of the corporate sector in western Germany. The period covered by our sample is
from 1987 to 1998.
Starting with a very large data set the number of observations decreases considerably
through incomplete balance sheets, outlier control and balancing. In particular, the need to
use the detailed schedule of fixed asset movements (Anlagespiegel) in order to apply our
algorithm for calculating the capital stock at replacement costs shrinks the available data to
2,303 firms included in the final estimations.8
The theoretical concept of the Q-theory of investment is microeconomic. Hence the use of
firm-level data seems the natural way to apply an empirical test of the theory. But using
individual balance sheet accounts has some caveats: the sample is not random and the data
include noise from individual irregularities. Nevertheless, the theory seems to be better
applicable to individual firm data. What leads to severe problems in using the balance
sheet for economic analysis is the fact that the majority of the data (85%) is based on tax
balance sheets. Therefore, the figures represented in the balance sheets accord with the
legal descriptions as defined in tax law and differ from the theoretical concepts in several
ways.9 To overcome these problems as far as possible, great efforts are made in the
measurement procedures; they are described in the following sections.
4. The capital stock at replacement costs: A new algorithm
The most prominent approaches for this transformation are the ones proposed by
Lindenberg/Ross (1981), the NBER-approach (Hall et.al. (1988)) and the algorithm
suggested by Lewellen/Badrinath (1997). In this paper we suggest an alternative algorithm
which, according to our understanding and the results of a comparison based on Monte
Carlo simulations, is almost comparable to the precise results of the algorithm by Lewellen
and Badrinath but has considerable lower data requirements.

In the following section we sketch the aforementioned approaches and try to show the core
idea as well as the data requirements for the implementation, before we present our own
approach. The next section contains a Monte Carlo simulation intended to compare the
outcomes of the different approaches with our own suggested algorithm.
4.1. A short review of the literature
4.1.1. Lindenberg und Ross (1981)
The algorithm by Lindenberg and Ross starts from year t = 1 where the book value at
historical costs less accumulated depreciation is taken as an approximation for the
unknown net capital stock at replacement values. At the beginning of period t = 1 we have
(in the following K* denotes capital stock at replacement costs while K denotes the book
value)
t

K =

In the following periods the capital stock is updated taking into account the depreciation
rate ( , book rate), price changes (i) and the technical process ( ) as well as gross
investment (It):

.
The capital stock contains fixed assets as well as inventories. The procedure described
above is applied to fixed assets. With respect to inventories two cases are distinguished:
- When using FIFO (First-In-First-Out) the valuation of the stock is rather close to
replacement costs and the book values remain unadjusted.
- When using LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) greater discrepancies will occur. In this case the
book values of inventories will be adjusted using a procedure close to the one described
above and the parameter settings 0
=
 and 0
=
 .
4.1.2. "NBER-approach" by Hall et al (1988)
While inventories are treated with a technique similar to the approach of Lindenberg and
Ross the NBER-approach adjusts the book value of fixed assets for price changes. Central
to the algorithm is the assumption about the average age a of the existing capital stock.
Thus if a =4, the adjustment of the book value takes into account the price changes of
capital goods,  , for the last 4 years. In general the estimated capital stock in period t is
given by

It is evident that the quality of the estimation hinges on the correctness of a . The average
age is calculated using historical balance sheet data for depreciation D:

4.1.3. Lewellen and Badrinath (1997)
Compared to the two algorithms described above, the approach suggested by Lewellen and
Badrinath is more complex. The basic idea is to disaggregate the actual capital stock into
the years of purchase in the first step and the price adjustment for the different vintages in
the second step. Like the a in the NBER-approach, this approach contains a magical
number as well. This time the key number for the quality of the procedure's results is the
longest lifetime of capital goods n

This adjustment routine guarantees the equality of estimated and balance sheet data for the
net capital stock at historical costs.
4.1.4. Critique
The Lindenberg-Ross-approach is rather simple and easy to implement. But it is obvious
that the quality of the estimated capital stock at actual prices will increase over time. The
quality of the initial estimate will be rather poor owing to overly fast depreciation of book
values because of tax considerations and the neglecting of capital goods price changes. The
updating of the capital stock might also be biased because book depreciation rates probably
overstate economic depreciation rates. Our own empirical estimates will show that initially
the book value amounts on average to only 40% of the economically meaningful
replacement value.10
As in the approach taken by Lindenberg and Ross, in the NBER-approach it is assumed
that book depreciations equal economic depreciations. Especially for German accounting
data, there will be major discrepancies because in general the tax-oriented depreciation
rates will exceed the economic rates. The calculations of average age and average lifetime
ignore the fact that the stock of fixed assets in a period t is a composition of several
investment vintages.
The approach taken by Lewellen and Badrinath is by far the most complex of the three
discussed. By taking into account the age structure of the still-living capital stock, the price
10 One solution often applied in empirical work is to leave out several years at the beginning of the
period covered. While that avoids using the worst estimates at the beginning of the estimation period,
there will still be a strongly decreasing measurement error over time.
-9-
adjustment can be expected to be rather precise. The main disadvantage of this approach
can be seen in the rather high data requirements. To estimate the capital stock for period t
the investment data for the n
~ -1 years preceding year t have to be given. Taking into
consideration the rather long lifetime of structures, this data requirements will hardly ever
be met when working with micro balance sheet data. Finally, the assumption of an equal
lifetime of all capital goods seems to be rather oversimplifying.
4.2. A new algorithm
4.2.1. The basic idea
The basic idea of the new algorithm which we propose is to split the actual capital stock
into two additive components. The first component contains the vintages which are still
alive and already belonged to the capital stock at the beginning of the first year in the data
set. We will add the subscript "old" to indicate this component. (In our data set this was the
year 1987.) The second component consists of the capital goods which were acquired
during the years covered by the data set and still belong to the capital stock. This
component will be indicated by the subscript "new". For these two components we apply
different adjustment procedures to transform the book values at historical costs and tax-
driven depreciations into economically meaningful net capital stock figures at replacement
costs. The final estimate of the capital stock will therefore be
*
*
,
*
new,t
t
old
t K
K
K +
= .
Let us first consider the "new" component. For this component the investment at actual
prices for period t is covered in the available data set. Each vintage leaves the capital stock
according to the retirement function commonly employed in the classical perpetual-
inventory procedure. In addition, each year the capital stock is revalued so as to take
account of the price development of capital goods.
Now let us look at the "old" part of the capital stock. The crucial point is to disaggregate
the existing capital stock at the beginning of the first year covered by the data set t0 into its
vintages. If this is achieved in a plausible way, each vintage leaves the capital stock in line
with the retirement function in the same way as the vintages of the "new" capital stock.
Besides this disaggregation into the different vintages, a second disaggregation is the
important separation into structures and equipment. These two components are
characterized by very different life-times which are associated with very different
depreciations as well as different price changes.
As the depreciations given in the balance sheet data are mainly driven by tax
considerations, their use would lead to a severe underestimation of the life time of capital
goods. Therefore we use sectoral data for depreciation rates and capital goods' lifetimes
which we assume will be closer to economic reality. Since the data set does not contain
any price information, we also use sectoral price data. Both sectoral data sets are
disaggregated into structures and equipment. The inventories are not revalued. Given that
-10-
most firms employ the First-In-First-Out valuation scheme, we take the book values as
beeing sufficiently close to replacement values. In this case (FIFO) there will only be
minor differences between book values and replacement values. In the next section of the
paper we will formalize the algorithm and present further details.
4.2.2. The disaggregation of the first period's capital stock into different vintages
The detailed schedule of fixed asset movements (Anlagenspiegel) contains information
concerning the sum of all past investment still in stock at historical costs (gross capital
stock at historical costs, g
t
K ).
Disaggregation into structures and equipment
In our starting period t0 we disaggregate the value of the capital stock ( g
t
K

) into structures
and equipment based on the respective shares of structures and equipment in the balance
sheets:

In the following all calculations are performed at the disaggregated level for structures and
equipment separately. To improve readability we leave out the subscript j.
Sectoral adjustment in year t0
We do not make the counterfactual assumption of equality between historical cost data and
actual replacement values. This procedure would lead to a severe underestimation of the
net capital stock at actual replacement values. Instead we use sectoral data supplied by the
Federal Statistical Office (Statistisches Bundesamt) to adjust for the discrepancies
stemming from the different depreciation methods and price schemes.
The starting point is the firm level balance sheet value adjusted for the sectoral ratio for
year t0:

gross and net capital stock. It is obvious that the adjusted values in the initial year t0 will be
the closer to the true value the more the structure of firm i's capital stock resembles the
structure of the capital stock in sector s in terms of both goods and age.
4.2.3. The retirement of the investment vintages
We disaggregate a vintage t into parts of different lifetime n. n denotes the part of a
vintage with lifetime n (it retires after being n years in stock) and N is the maximum
lifetime. In the course of its maximum lifetime N the vintage will retire completely.

4.2.4. Disaggregation of the capital stock at the beginning of the initial year into its
vintages and retirements
The initial estimate of the capital stock is disaggregated into its vintages of investment
separately for structures and equipment. To achieve this disaggregation several
assumptions are necessary:
- the retirement function is stable over time,
- investment in the prior years has taken place evenly,
- the capital goods depreciate linearly over time.
These assumptions imply:
- what shares of investment vintages still belong to the capital stock, and
- the average lifetime of the vintages.
Let us denote the oldest vintage still belonging to the capital stock with 0. Then summing
the depreciations and taking into account the price adjustment 1

4.3. A comparison of the different approaches
In this section of the paper we run a Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the performance of
the algorithms by Lindenberg/Ross, the NBER approach, the algorithm proposed by
Lewellen/Badrinath and our own proposed alternative algorithm.
- The average lifetime n of fixed assets is 10 years, evenly distributed between 5 and 15
years.
- Each firm has a specific average lifetime i
n of its fixed assets and a specific retirement
function.
- The retirement rates in
 of fixed assets with lifetimes n = 5, 6, ..., 15 for firm i are
drawn at random. They will be held constant over the whole simulation period. The
average lifetime of the firms fixed assets is then given by

=
=
15
5
n
in
i n
n  .
- We set book depreciations equal to economic depreciations, so there is no need to
correct non-economic, tax-oriented depreciations. (Note that this assumption has to be
made in the approaches by L/R, NBER and L/W, while in our algorithm we make use
of an adjustment procedure in the initial year to correct for differences and apply an
economic meaningful linear depreciation scheme.)
A. Equal investment throughout all years, price increases randomly drawn from a
uniform distribution between 0 and 10 % per year.
B. Random draws from the empirical data (Bilanzstatistik/VGR)
According to this procedure, the true capital stock at replacement values is generated for a
period of 70 years. We assume that the data available to the researcher start at period 21
(=t0).

It can be seen from the simulation results that the algorithm we propose performs rather
well. The results show that our algorithm is outperformed by the algorithm suggested by
Lewellen/Baldrinath. But it should be remembered that their approach requires investment
to be known at least 10 years before the first capital stock can be calculated. Therefore
their approach, even having the smallest error, cannot be applied in most empirical cases.
Comparing the algorithm which we propose with the two approaches having similar data
requirements, we find that the errors for the new algorithm are rather small.
4.4. Estimates of the capital stock
4.4.1. The capital stock at replacement costs for the Bundesbank data file
If we summarize the results, we find that the ratio of the capital stock at replacement costs
to balance sheet values at historical costs is on average 2.5. There is a strong increase in
the capital stock at replacement values by about 25% between 1987 and 1993. In the
following years up to 1998 the capital stock is almost stationary.

The comparison with official sectoral data (national accounts) shows that for
manufacturing and construction the estimates based on the individual balance sheet data
resemble the aggregate data reasonably well. Only for the wholesale/retail trade sector do
the balance sheet-based figures underestimate the sectoral data noticeably. When assessing
the results it should be borne in mind that no information concerning the sectoral level of
capital stocks was used in the calculations. Only sectoral price changes and sectoral ratios
of different price concepts were used for adjusting the book values as well as the sales
coverage ratio of our data base. We therefore conclude that the algorithm used for
estimating the capital stock at replacement values based on given historical cost data from
firm-level balance sheets performs rather well.

5. The Calculation of Q
While the advantage of average Q based on stock prices is the exploitation of market
expectations there are several serious drawbacks to this conventional approach. First,
market expectations can be rather poor. The recent slump in technology shares, which lost
about 90% of their value within one year, may serve as an example of the noisiness of
share prices. The second drawback is that only a small fraction of an economy's firms is
quoted on stock markets. Finally, it is marginal Q that is theoretically relevant for the
firm's investment decision and not average Q, except under special conditions concerning
production technology.
In this chapter we outline our approach to calculating measures of Q using balance sheet
data. Both measures of Q we calculate are based on balance sheet data using a vector-
autoregressive forecasting procedure. By estimating market values of equity, we first
calculate average Q values comparable to the conventional Q measures based on stock
markets. In a second approach following Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995, 1998) we
estimate marginal Q-values based on strong assumptions about firms' production
technology. After giving a brief overview of related work, the estimation procedure as well
as empirical results are presented.
5.1. An Overview of empirical work using the direct forecasting approach
In the following overview we concentrate on empirical papers which adopt the direct
forecasting approach. An extensive overview of empirical studies using stock market data
was already provided by Hubbard (1998). We start with the influential paper by Abel and
Blanchard (1986), which introduced the method of vector autoregression into the context
of Q-models. Even though it only used aggregated data, the paper laid the fundamental
basis for the following extensions to panel data by Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995, 1998).
The paper by Bontempi et al (2001) follows Gilchrist and Himmelberg by applying the
approach to a large panel data set of non-quoted Italian firms.
5.1.1. Abel/Blanchard (1986)
Abel and Blanchard base their approach on the Q-theory of investment. Instead of using
the conventional stock market-based average Q, they estimate Q through forming
expectations on future returns based on lagged variables.12 The authors use a VAR model
to make use of the time series information contained in their macroeconomic data set.
Marginal Q is estimated as the discounted sum of expected future profits.13 The
expectations of the unknown marginal profits and the unknown discount factors are each
estimated as linear combinations of an observable vector Z which evolves according to a
12 See Abel/Blanchard (1986), p. 249.
13 Thereby Abel and Blanchard treat the future discount rate as an unknown random variable. In this
case the estimation of the unknown marginal Q requires taking into account the product of random
variables.
-20-
vector-autoregressive process. As the information set 1
-
t includes only lagged values of
Z, the estimated Q is a beginning-of-period marginal profit of investment.14
Variables used to estimate the VAR are, besides the returns on equity and debt, the ratio of
labor cost to the capital stock, the sales/capital stock ratio, the stock market valuation of
capital, average Q, the manufacturing price inflation, and the investment ratio.
In the estimated investment functions, only lagged values of the estimated marginal Q
series have any explanatory power for investment, whereas the parameter of current Q is
insignificantly negative. If added to the investment equation, lagged sales appear to have a
significant positive influence on investment.
The performance of marginal Q in explaining the investment ratio is relatively poor. The
authors present a list of possible causes of the poor results: the aggregation problems, the
assumption of homogeneity of capital, the assumption of perfect capital markets and the
negligence of liquidity constraints.
5.1.2. Gilchrist/Himmelberg (1995, 1998)
Following Abel and Blanchard (1986), the authors estimate a set of vector-autoregressive
forecasting equations using a subset of balance sheet information. The forecasts of the
VAR model are used to construct the expected value of marginal Q conditional on the
observed fundamentals. The expected value of marginal Q is called fundamental Q.15
The unobservable marginal profit of capital is proxied by a measure of realized profits in
relation to the existing capital. This approximation holds under strong assumptions
concerning the production technology.16
The VAR model is estimated separately for a priori liquidity constrained and unconstrained
firms to allow for differences in the forecasting scheme. The authors do not use firm-
specific depreciation rates nor time-varying interest rates. The fixed value assumed for
depreciation is 15% and the fixed value assumed for the interest rate is 6%.
Tobin's Q based on share prices leads to much lower parameter estimates compared to
fundamental Q. Adding cash flow as a further explanatory variable leads to a significant
cash flow sensitivity for both Q specifications. When the sample is grouped a priori, only
the constrained firms show a significant cash flow sensitivity. Controlling for cash flow
through the incorporation in the forecasting system does not alter the findings of the
previous literature.
14 Abel and Blanchard use quarterly data on US manufacturing for the period 1948:2 to 1979:3. The
VAR model is estimated using 5 or 7 variables following a fourth-order vector-autoregressive process.
15 In the 1998 paper Gilchrist and Himmelberg extend the approach, analyzing in a first step the
dynamics of firms' investment behaviour using a VAR model for panel data. See
Gilchrist/Himmelberg (1998).
16 See Gilchrist/Himmelberg (1995), p. 550.
-21-
Even if the authors find Tobin's Q a poor proxy for investment opportunities, the results of
the literature using Tobin's Q are confirmed. The fundamental Q seems to be superior,
leading to higher parameter estimates. Because cash flow is explicitly included in the
forecasting model, the authors interpret an additional sensitivity of cash flow as evidence
of the existence of capital market imperfections.
5.1.3. Bontempi et al (2001)
Bontempi et al base their analysis on the fundamental distinction between equipment and
structures.17 These two components of the capital stock are characterized by different rates
of depreciation and a different tax treatment. The usual aggregation of equipment and
structures is criticized because this aggregation rests on the counterfactual assumption of
perfect substitutability. Further, the authors assume that equipment and structures show
different adjustment costs.18
The results show that equipment reacts strongly and significantly to Q, whereas structures
do not respond to Q.19 Some of the regressions have to be interpreted with care because
the Sargan test fails to reject the validity of the instruments. When testing for different
forms of adjustment costs, the authors find that the assumption of convex adjustment costs
does not hold for structures. This implies a fixed component in the adjustment costs. When
estimating separate equations for purchases and sales of investment goods, the results show
that only equipment responds significantly to Q, with purchases reacting much more
strongly than sales.
In a further step Bontempi et al explore the possibility of interrelated adjustment costs. It is
therefore assumed that the level of structures influences the adjustment costs of equipment
and vice versa, and that the adjustment cost function is linearly homogeneous. The
estimated investment functions now include, besides the Q-measures for equipment and
structures, the ratio of the two components of the capital stock as well as the product of Q
and the measure of the capital stock's structure. For this investment equations Q is
significant for structures as well as for equipment, while the structure of the capital stock is
never significant and the combined effect only sometimes. Based on these results, the
authors conclude that the two capital goods seem to be complements in their adjustment
costs.20
17 See Bontempi et. al. (2001), p. 2.
18 The authors use a large database including balance sheets and income statements of more than 52,000
Italian manufacturing firms. The final estimates are base on a balanced panel of 1,539 firms.

-22-
5.2. The Calculation of Q using firm-level balance sheet data
We use the following definition of marginal Q stated by Hayashi (1982) as the starting
point: "Remember that Q, which we call marginal Q, is the ratio of the market value of an
additional unit of capital to its replacement cost."21
As marginal Q is not observed, one way to overcome this problem followed extensively in
the empirical literature is to use stock market data to measure unobservable expectations.
Since in Germany only the smallest share of an economy's firms is quoted on stock
markets, the concept of using stock market data to study firms' investment behaviour
excludes the majority of firms from an empirical investigation.22 When using accounting
data it is therefore necessary to apply alternative concepts to find measures that proxy for
the expectations about future profits or future marginal profitabilities of capital. In the
following two concepts for measuring the firm's investment profitabilities, average Q and
marginal Q, are illustrated.
5.2.1. Calculating Tobin's Q (average Q)
The approach used in this paper is based on the formula used by several authors23 to
calculate Tobin's Q for firm i at period t as the ratio of the market value of equity (
it
V ) plus
the market value of outstanding debt ( )
it
D minus the replacement value of all remaining
assets besides the capital stock ( )
it
N to the replacement value of the capital stock (

K ):

When using balance sheet data in the empirical analysis, no market values of equity and
debt are available in the data source and they therefore have to be estimated. The approach
used in this paper is to estimate market values of equity based on a VAR-forecasting model
as was suggested by Abel and Blanchard (1986). This approach was extended to panel
data by Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995, 1998).
The VAR-model we estimate contains three variables, pre-tax profits (PTP), sales (S) and
cash flow (CF). The use of pre-tax profits instead of the theoretically more appealing after
tax profits is inevitable because the apparent tax rate often shows implausible values and
enormous variance. This is due to the fact that the data base contains firms of different
legal status and no information about the firms' dividend policy. In our final estimates we
make use of the forecasts based on a VAR containing one lag, but we obtained comparable
results when using two lags.
21 Hayashi (1982), p. 214.
22 Beside the argument of data availability, the empirical results using stock market data have been
rather disappointing, see e.g. the overview in Chirinko (1993).
23 See e.g. Erickson/Whited (2000a) p. 1034.

The equations of the VAR do not contain time dummies because we are interested in
expected values conditioned on lagged values and fixed firm effects and not conditioned
on specific time effects.24
As the usual LSDV estimator is known to be biased, one of the various other available
approaches has to be followed, taking into account the problems of dynamic panel data
estimation.25 When applying a direct bias correction to estimate the dynamic equations
containing fixed effects, all variables j are measured as deviations from their firm-
individual means and therefore the equations do not contain firm-specific effects:

Using these forecasts, the discounted value of future profits at time t can be calculated as

We use the capital market interest rate (Umlaufsrendite festverzinslicher Wertpapiere
inländischer Emittenten) as a measure of the opportunity costs to discount future profits.
For each year the firm faces its forecasting problem, we use the actual term structure of
capital market interest rates for 1 to 9 years maturity. For discounting even further
forecasts the interest rate with a maturity of 9 years is used. In this respect we differ from
earlier approaches (Gilchrist and Himmelberg 1995, 1998 and Bontempi et. al. 2001),
which for simplicity assume a fixed interest rate for all years and for all maturities.

5.2.2. Calculating marginal Q
So far we have estimated average Qa using the estimated market value of equity.28 To
calculate marginal (fundamental) Qm we follow a similar approach using the described
Panel-VAR-technique. To calculate fundamental Qm we first have to find a proxy for the
marginal profitability of capital ( it
MPK ). Following Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1998) we
use a measure based on a Cobb-Douglas-Production technology where capital is seen as a
quasi fixed factor of production:


 M
L
CK
Y =
26 This formulation of the forecast process does not take into account the existence of individual fixed
effects. Either these effects have to be cancelled out by some data transformation (averaging or
differencing) or they have to be estimated explicitly. See the Appendix for further details.
27 In our calculation we stop after 200 forecasting periods instead of using an indefinite forecast horizon.
28 From a theoretical point of view a marginal Q is more appropriate, see Gilchrist/Himmelberg (1998).

Therefore, the unknown MPK is proportional to the sales-to-capital-stock ratio. To
estimate the unknown parameter  we assume that on average the MPK equals the user
costs of capital (U), which we measure as the sum of the apparent interest rate (ri) and the
rate of depreciation (di). Using the sectoral calculation of  including all years and all

29 While Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995) assume a constant value for all firms and all years we take
the individual depreciation rates, resulting mainly from different ratios of structure to equipment for
individual firms, as well as the interest term strucuture into account.

6. Empirical Results
6.1. Descriptive evidence
The following table contains some descriptive statistics for the estimated average and
marginal Q. From the table as well as from the graph containing kernel-density estimations
for the two Qs, it can be seen that average Q exhibits on average a higher level and greater
variance.30 While the average Q is somewhat higher than the expected equilibrium value,
the estimated marginal Q values are somewhat too low.

Before estimating the dynamic investment equations using the two different measures of Q
we take a non-parametric approach to see whether we can find any indication of a linear
relation in the bivariate case. We estimate three non-parametric regressions explaining the
investment ratio by its lagged value, average and marginal Q respectively.
30 To control for outliers we drop the upper and lower 0.5% quantils for both (average and marginal) Q-
measures.

The non-parametric regression indicates a positive and fairly linear relation between
investment and the Q measures for positive Q-values, while the figure for lagged
investment might indicate a saturation point.
6.2. Estimated Q-investment functions
The investment functions are estimated using a bias-corrected estimator to take into
account the resulting bias when using the lagged endogenous variable.31 We also applied
GMM-estimation techniques to estimate the dynamic investment function. But when
comparing the two estimation techniques we prefer the direct bias correction method for
two reasons. First, when analyzing different estimator simulation studies (Kiviet (1995),
Judson and Owen (1999), Hansen (2001)) find a corrected LSDV estimator superior
compared to GMM-estimators.
Second, as is usually the case when using large micro data files containing mainly cross-
section information, the correlations of the data are rather low in almost all respects.
Therefore, the use of differences instead of levels considerably reduces the amount of
information contained in the data used for estimation. Instrumental estimation is known to
be problematic when instruments are rather weak.32 When instruments are weak, the
results are extremely sensitive to the choice of instruments, leading to a large number of
degrees of freedom for the researcher. We therefore regard it as an advantage of the bias
correction approach that it restricts these facilities.33

We find both measures of Q to be highly significant.34 In both equations the lagged
investment ratio is highly significant as well. Comparing the parameters, we find that the
parameter of marginal Q is four times the parameter of average Q. But it has to be taken
into account that average Q has a standard deviation almost four times the standard
31 See the appendix for details about the estimation procedure.
32 When instrumenting the difference of Q by the lagged difference of Q we loose about 99% of the
information contained in the difference of Q!
33 A comparison of the results using GMM-methods is given in the appendix.
34 These results confirm the significant influence of Q on German firms investment spending found
when using sectoral data, see Behr/Bellgardt (1998, 2000). For results for German firms using stock
market data see Audretsch/Elston (2002).
-30-
deviation of marginal Q. The parameter of average Q is at the upper bound of the interval
of parameters found in empirical studies using stock market data rather than the direct
forecasting approach.35 The higher parameter of marginal Q is closer to the theoretical
expectations about its value when trying to interpret the parameter as the capital stock
adjustment cost parameter. However, because of the dependence of the parameter value on
the standard deviation of the Q measure, the parameter should be interpreted with care.
Whited (1992) discusses the problems of inferring adjustment cost parameters from the Q-
parameter in detail.
Even if the simple variance decomposition does not hold exactly in the context of the
dynamic panel data estimation, the share of explained variance is still a useful indicator of
the explanatory power of the estimated equation. It turns out that average Q (5%) explains
a slightly larger part of investment compared to marginal Q (4%).
As marginal and average Q were measured quite differently, one might ask whether the
information is rather redundant, or whether the two measures are independent of one
another. As shown by Hayashi (1982), the two measures can be interchanged only in the
case of perfect competition and linear homogeneous technology.
Therefore, comparing the two different measures can also be seen as an indirect test of the
combined hypothesis of the production function and the adjustment cost function of the
capital stock being linearly homogeneous and of perfect competition. Of course, the
comparison is based on the operationalisation of both concepts and therefore depends
strongly on the adequacy of the operationalisation procedure. The following shows the
estimated dynamic investment function containing marginal as well as average Q.

We find that both measures of Q contain valuable and largely independent information
explaining the investment behaviour of firms. According to the t-values, average Q does
explain partially a somewhat larger amount of the investment compared to marginal Q.
Together both measures of investment profitability explain about 10% of the variation of
investment according to the naive measure of residual sum of squares divided by total sum
of squares. The finding of fairly independent information in the two different measures of
Q casts doubt on the theoretical assumptions of perfect competition and linear homogenous
technology, which would make the use of the two measures interchangeable.
35 See e.g. Whited (1992).

6.3. Results for classes of firm size
In this section of the paper we analyse the investment behavior of four classes of firm size.
The following table contains descriptive measures for these four classes of firm size.36
As can be seen, the investment ratio decreases with firm size from 16.6 % in the smallest
class of firms to only 11.8 % in the class containing the largest firms. While marginal Q
also decreases from 0.7 for the smallest firms to only 0.6 in the class of the largest firms,
there is no such evidence for average Q.

Next we estimate dynamic investment functions for the four different size-classes using a
direct bias correction estimation method. The following table contains the results. It can be
seen that the firms belonging to different classes exhibit strong differences in their
investment behaviour. The influence of the lagged investment ratio increases from 0.05 for
the class of smallest to 0.23 for the class of largest firms and is significantly different from
0 in all classes. Of course, it has to be borne in mind that the smaller the capital stock the
less continuous will the investment process of a firm be according to pure aggregation
effects. For larger firms the aggregation will smooth out such discontinuities. The
parameter for average Q almost halves from 0.092 for the smallest firms to only 0.040 for
36 The variable used to classify firms according to size is total assets (TA, balance sheet total) in 1988,
the year prior to the estimation period. Because only the balance sheet total is observable for lenders
and outsiders, we do not correct the balance sheet total for the capital stock at replacement values. The
grouping according to the balance sheet total corrected for the revaluation of the capital stock leads to
no major changes in the results.
-32-
the largest firms. Therefore it can be stated that the larger the firms the more its investment
ratio is influenced by its past investment behaviour and the less it takes the profitability,
measured by average Q, into account.
When using marginal Q the findings for the different size classes are similar concerning
the increasing influence of lagged investment for increasing firm size. For marginal Q
there is less evidence of decreasing influence with firm size compared to average Q. Each
of the four different size classes show a strong and significant reaction to marginal Q.

7. Conclusion
In this paper we have analyzed the investment behaviour of German firms within the
framework of the Q-theory. Facing two severe problems of non-adequate capital stock
balance sheet data and non-available stock market data, alternative measures were applied.
Transforming the balance sheet figures of the capital stock less depreciations at historical
costs into meaningful figures at replacement values was accomplished using a new
algorithm. The disaggregation into structures and equipment, the disaggregation into
-33-
vintages and the existence of different capital goods' lifetimes is taken into account.
Since anonymous individual firm balance sheet data were used, no stock market measure
of Q is available. The data basis contained roughly 2,000 firms covering the twelve years
for the period 1987 to 1998. By following the approach of Abel and Blanchard and
Gilchrist and Himmelberg, measures of Q were derived making use of a vector-
autoregressive model to forecast future profitability directly. Two different measures of Q,
marginal and average Q were derived. Both, a direct bias correction method and the GMM
approach, were applied to estimate the investment functions. Given the loss of information
when turning to differenced variables, as also because simulation results favour a direct
bias correction procedure, the direct bias correction method was preferred to the GMM
approach.
The estimation results of dynamic investment equations show that the Q measures
influence the firm's fixed investment spending significantly. When comparing the two Q-
proxies, the average Q slightly outperforms marginal Q. This outcome might be due to the
strong assumptions concerning the production technology underlying the calculation of
marginal Q which are perhaps not met in reality.
When analyzing the investment behaviour in four different classes of firm size, we find
that larger firms react less strongly to Q and more strongly to lagged investment.

C. Details of the estimation technique
A direct bias correction procedure
The procedure is based on Kiviet (1995) and Hansen (2001). The basic idea is to estimate
the asymptotical bias of the least-squares-dummy-variable-model through a plug-in
method. In the following

E. The data source
The data set after calculating the capital stock using the detailed schedule of fixed asset
movements leaves us with 3,169 firms and 11 years to start with.
To prevent outliers biasing the results we drop the upper and lower 0.5 % of the
observations of the following nine variables:
- ratio of aggregated investment to the aggregated capital stock
- ratio of investment in equipment to the capital stock of equipment
- ratio of investment in structures to the capital stock of structures
- ratio of pre-tax profits to the capital stock
- ratio of sales to the capital stock
- ratio of cash flow to the capital stock
- ratio of operating income to the capital stock
- marginal Q
- average Q.
The balancing of the data after eliminating the outliers leaves 2,303 firms in the sample.
Owing to lags, the period available covers 10 years, 1989-1998.
Throughout the analysis we use (with one exception) all variables at nominal values. The
reason for doing so is the use of ratios in the investment equation:

By dividing through the capital stock, the resulting ratios contain the relevant information
for the investor according to our understanding. We do not see a ratio of, for examples ales
at prices of year t-k to the capital stock at prices of year t-k as constituting a relevant piece
of information for the investor. By the same reasoning, we do not envisage an investor
deciding about investment at prices of year t-k divided by the capital stock at prices of year
t-k.
