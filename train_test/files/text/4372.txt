Introduction
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used in
patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic
kidney disease (CKD) due to their impact on long-term out-
comes, including overall mortality,1,2 but approximately
30­50% of patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibition experience aldosterone breakthrough,3 a
phenomenon where aldosterone levels increase up to or
above pre-treatment levels after 6­12 months of ACE inhi-
bition.4 Aldosterone breakthrough is not merely a function
of inadequateACE inhibition,5 but the details of its underly-
ing mechanism remain unknown. Aldosterone is primarily
regulated by angiotensin II (ATII), serum potassium levels,
and to a minor extent by serum adrenocorticotropic hor-
mone (ACTH). Breakthrough has been shown in patients on
ARBs,6 indicating that ATII derived from non-ACE cataly-
sis of angiotensin 1 (AT1) to ATII is unlikely to play a role
in breakthrough. Additionally, hyperkalemia does not
appear to be contributory, as potassium levels are not sig-
nificantly different between patients with and without
breakthrough.7 There may be a role for the AT2 receptor, as

Abstract
Introduction: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are widely used in
congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease, but up to 40% of patients will experience aldosterone breakthrough,
with aldosterone levels rising above pre-treatment levels after 6­12 months of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
blockade. Aldosterone breakthrough has been associated with worsening congestive heart failure and chronic kidney
disease, yet the pathophysiology remains unclear. Breakthrough has not been associated with elevated peripheral blood
pressure, but no studies have assessed its effect on central blood pressure.
Methods: Nineteen subjects with well-controlled peripheral blood pressure on stable doses of angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker had aldosterone levels checked and central blood pressure parameters
measured using the SphygmoCor system. The central blood pressure parameters of subjects with or without
breakthrough, defined as serum aldosterone >15 ng/dl, were compared.
Results: Of the 19 subjects, six had breakthrough with a mean aldosterone level of 33.8 ng/dl, and 13 were without
breakthrough with a mean level of 7.1 ng/dl. There was no significant difference between the two groups in any central
blood pressure parameter.
Conclusions: We found no correlation between aldosterone breakthrough and central blood pressure. The clinical
impact of aldosterone breakthrough likely depends on its non-genomic, pro-fibrotic, pro-inflammatory effects rather
than its regulation of extracellular volume.

ACEi subsequently showed reduced aldosterone levels after
receiving an AT2 antagonist.8
Observational studies have shown that aldosterone
breakthrough is associated with increased morbidity in
patients with chronic heart and kidney diseases, including
increased left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH),7 reduced
exercise tolerance,9 increased albuminuria in CKD,10 and
accelerated decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR).11
Two hypotheses could explain the clinical impact of
aldosterone breakthrough: (a) activation of pro-fibrotic
and pro-inflammatory pathways by aldosterone leading to
glomerulosclerosis12,13 and LVH,14 or (b) increased sys-
temic pressure due to increased sodium absorption and
potassium excretion. The former hypothesis implies that
the deleterious effects of breakthrough are based primar-
ily in aldosterone's non-epithelial effects, while the latter
hypothesis implies that aldosterone's classic effects at the
epithelial sodium channel are responsible for injury.
Studies of aldosterone breakthrough, to date, have not
shown that breakthrough leads to elevated peripheral
blood pressure (PBP).4,10,15 Central blood pressure (CBP)
and PBP often do not correlate,16 exemplified by the
reduced CBP with amlodipine/perindopril compared to
atenolol/thiazide in the CAFÉ subgroup of the ASCOT
trial despite statistically equivalent PBP.17 CBP parameters
have also been shown to be incrementally superior to PBP
in predicting carotid hypertrophy and LVH,18 time to first
cardiovascular event,19 microalbuminuria,20 and progres-
sion to end stage renal disease (ESRD).21 Given that PBP
may not accurately represent CBP and that CBP has inde-
pendent value in predicting cardiovascular (CV) and renal
outcomes, we investigated whether aldosterone break-
through was associated with elevated CBP parameters in a
cohort of patients on long-standingACEi andARB therapy
with well-controlled PBP.
Methods
Participants
This cross-sectional study recruited volunteers from the
nephrology clinics at New York Presbyterian Hospital. All
subjects signed an informed consent before enrollment.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of Columbia University Medical Center.
Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had well-con-
trolled PBP (<140/90 mm Hg) on stable doses of ACEi or
ARB for >1 year, as well as no changes to other anti-hyper-
tensive medications for >1 year, including diuretics. Patients
were excluded if they had atrial fibrillation, a diagnosis of
secondary hypertension, known structural vascular abnor-
malities, potassium >5.5, or a prescription for a mineralo-
corticoid receptor blocker. It was not deemed necessary that
a patient be on maximal doses of ACEi to be included in the
study, since no association has been found between the dose
of ACEi and the incidence of breakthrough.22
Non-invasive hemodynamic data acquisition
Participants were studied in the seated position, brachial
systolic and diastolic blood pressures were obtained
using an aneroid sphygmomanometer, and those pres-
sures were in turn used to calibrate the SphygmoCor
AtCor central arterial pressure device.23 Applanation
tonometry of the radial artery provided waveforms that
were processed with pulse wave analysis according to the
manufacturer's guidelines to derive a waveform of the
ascending aorta. Systolic and diastolic CBP were meas-
ured directly from this derived central waveform, central
pulse pressure (CPP) calculated as the difference between
systolic and diastolic CBP, augmentation pressure (AP)
calculated as the difference between the second and first
systolic peaks, and augmentation index (AI) as the ratio
of AP to CPP, normalized for a HR of 75. Estimations of
CBP using applanation tonometry have been well vali-
dated, and non-invasive measurements of CBP using this
technique correspond closely to those obtained through
catheterization, with a mean error of only 1.1 mm Hg in
one meta-analysis.24
Definition and measurement of aldosterone
breakthrough
A variety of different cutoffs have been used to define
aldosterone breakthrough including the mean value in the
studied population (ranging from 6­10 ng/dl). For this
study, aldosterone breakthrough was defined using the
strictest available criteria for a cross-sectional study: an
aldosterone level above the upper limit of normal,22
defined as >15 ng/dl at our institution. Sample acquisition
for aldosterone levels was conducted in a seated, upright
posture along with routine laboratory testing ordered at
each participant's outpatient nephrology clinic visit. No
restrictions were imposed on participants regarding diet or
fluid intake prior to sample acquisition.
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was conducted using Student's t-test to eval-
uate for difference between those patients with and with-
out aldosterone breakthrough, with significance set at
p<0.05. Analyses were also performed separately for quar-
tiles of aldosterone levels.
Results
Patient characteristics
The mean age of participants in the study was 53±18 years,
with roughly equal representation of ACEi and ARB in
their medication lists (Table 1). Diuretics were over-
represented in the breakthrough group, but had been stably
dosed for >1 year as per our inclusion criteria so that they
Beenken and Bomback 3
would be without dynamic effect on the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) axis. CBP and AP are known
to increase with age,16 but no significant difference was
found between the mean age of individuals with and with-
out breakthrough. Women comprised only 26% of indi-
viduals, and the majority of the participants were either
Hispanic or Caucasian by ethnicity. No significant differ-
ence in body mass index (BMI) could be seen between the
two groups. Of the 19 subjects evaluated, six were found
to have aldosterone levels >15 ng/dl, classifying them as
having aldosterone breakthrough as per our pre-defined
criteria. Between those with and without aldosterone
breakthrough, there was no difference in serum potassium
levels but a significant difference was found in terms of the
severity of CKD. In addition to an increased prevalence of
macroalbuminuria, individuals with aldosterone break-
through had a mean serum creatinine (Cr) 3.2±1.9 mg/dl,
significantly higher than those without breakthrough, who
had Cr of 1.4±0.5 mg/dl (p<0.006). A broad range of eti-
ologies leading to CKD were represented in our study
group (Supplementary Material, Table 1).
Central hemodynamics in aldosterone
breakthrough
None of the central hemodynamic parameters we meas-
ured had any significant difference according to aldoster-
one breakthrough status (Table 2). Mean CBP, CPP, AP,
and AI were all without statistically significant differences
between the two groups. Categorizing the subjects in terms
of quartiles for serum aldosterone levels 0­6 ng/dl (n=5),
6­9 ng/dl (n=5), 9­20 ng/dl (n=5), and >20 ng/dl (n=4),
created four groups each with statistically significant dif-
ferences in mean serum aldosterone level (Table 3).
However, this grouping by quartiles did not reveal any sta-
tistically significant differences between the first and
fourth quartiles nor any statistically significant trends in
the overall dataset.
Discussion
In this cross-sectional study of 19 patients with CKD on
long-standing ACEi or ARB therapy with well-controlled
PBP, we found no evidence that aldosterone breakthrough,
manifest in one-third of the study population, was associ-
ated with elevations in any CBP parameters. The absence
of correlation between aldosterone breakthrough and cen-
tral hemodynamics in our cross-sectional study suggests
that aldosterone's non-genomic effects, especially its
upregulation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic path-
ways, are likely responsible for the pathophysiology asso-
ciated with aldosterone breakthrough.
Aldosterone's effects on fibrosis and inflammation are
well documented: transforming growth factor-beta
(TGF-b)- and Type I collagen expression are increased in
rats with chronically elevated aldosterone levels,25 aldos-
terone induces superoxide production,26 as well as apopto-
sis through free radical production,27 while spironolactone
reduces glomerulosclerosis in rat models.12 These mecha-
nisms are believed to underlie aldosterone's deleterious
effects on left ventricular function and GFR. The absence
of any hemodynamic alteration associated with aldoster-
one breakthrough, either in PBP as documented in prior
studies,4,10,15 or in CBP as presented here, suggests that the
pathophysiology of aldosterone breakthrough is driven
primarily by its pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects.
On first pass, it would seem surprising that there is no
effect on central hemodynamics from aldosterone break-
through, especially in light of the differential effect of
RAAS inhibition on central hemodynamics: ACEi/ARB
have been shown to reduce CBP to a greater degree than
PBP17,28 and, in general, vasodilators inclusive of calcium
channel blockers and alpha-blockers are more potent at
reducing central pressures when compared to non-vasodi-
lators.29 But it should be borne in mind that aldosterone

levels in aldosterone breakthrough are not a function of
ATII activity and do not correlate with upregulated RAAS
pathway activation. In a study of 34 patients with CHF on
maximal recommended doses of ACEi, aldosterone break-
through occurred despite maximal ACE inhibition as con-
firmed by measurement of ATII/ATI ratios,5 and the
proportion of individuals experiencing aldosterone break-
through remained the same whether on either ACEi or
ARB alone or on combined ACEi/ARB therapy.30 Since
elevated aldosterone levels in aldosterone breakthrough
are independent of ATII and its effect on vasoconstriction,
it could be reasonably expected that central hemodynam-
ics remain unchanged following aldosterone breakthrough
as seen in this study.
Our study is notable for being the first to examine the
impact of aldosterone breakthrough on CBP. In addition,
this study and its CKD subject population provide inter-
esting new data for the field of breakthrough. We report
here a 32% prevalence of aldosterone breakthrough in
patients with CKD on ACEi or ARB therapy, using a
very conservative definition of breakthrough, but also
found that those with breakthrough had significantly
worse kidney function compared to those without break-
through. Reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) has previously been shown in a multivariate
regression analysis to be predictive of the likelihood of
aldosterone breakthrough in a longitudinal study of
patients with diabetic nephropathy, mean eGFR=45, and
macroalbuminuria.31 Our data likewise may suggest that
reduced glomerular filtration or impaired renal handling
of sodium, potassium, or the hormones of the RAAS in
CKD could predispose individuals to aldosterone break-
through. Although elevated Cr has in turn been corre-
lated with increased CPP,21 our data show no such
evidence of statistically significant differences in CPP
between the groups.
Limitations to our study include its inability to assess
causality given its cross-sectional design. The study's
small size additionally may leave it underpowered to
assess for statistically significant differences in hemody-
namic parameters between individuals with and without
aldosterone breakthrough. Finally, given the unequal gen-
der and race distribution of the participants in our cohort,
further study is necessary before these data can be applied
to the population as a whole.
In conclusion, we show here that aldosterone break-
through, in a cohort of CKD patients with well-controlled
PBP, occurs in approximately one-third of patients on
long-standing ACEi or ARB therapy. We detected signifi-
cantly worse renal function in those who demonstrated
breakthrough compared to those who did not. However,
we demonstrated no differences in CBP parameters
between these groups, suggesting that aldosterone break-
through does not appear to mediate an effect via the hor-
mone's classical, epithelial actions.
