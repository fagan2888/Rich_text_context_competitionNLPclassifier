Polygyny and HIV in Malawi

Abstract
We review the relationship between polygyny and HIV and identify a positive
individual-level correlation, and a negative ecological correlation. We subsequently
examine two mechanisms that contribute to the individual-level correlation. First, we
find that men in polygynous marriages have more extramarital sex than men in
monogamous unions (both in terms of self reports and in terms of spousal reports of the
suspicion of adultery). Second, we find evidence of adverse selection of HIV positive
women into polygynous unions via an investigation of the relationship between
marriage order and polygyny status. We conclude with reflections about possible
explanations for the distinct individual and ecological correlations.

1. Background
In early scientific, policy, and popular discourses around HIV/AIDS, polygyny often
features as a cultural practice that facilitates the spread of the epidemic (Gausset 2001;
Oppong and Kalipeni 2003). The association between polygyny and HIV, however, is
not very often empirically verified. In theory, there are several plausible reasons why
polygyny may contribute to the spread of HIV. First, polygynous marriages involve
multiple partners, each of whom might introduce HIV into the household. Once one of
the spouses is or becomes HIV positive, the others are also exposed to HIV. The
simultaneous nature of partnerships in polygynous unions is likely to have an
independent effect on the spread of the virus (net of the quantum of partnerships): under
serial monogamy earlier partners are not at risk of being infected by later partners; in
concurrent relationships, the protective effect of the sequence is lost (Morris and
Kretzschmar 1997). Concurrency of partnerships is considered particularly important
for HIV because the probability of transmitting the virus is highest in the period
immediately following seroconversion (Morris and Kretzschmar 1997; Wawer, et al.
2005).4 Second, men in societies where polygyny is practiced tend to marry at a later
age and more often have casual sexual partnerships in early adulthood (Caldwell, et al.
1993; Philipson and Posner 1995). Third, the institution of polygyny presumably
endorses the belief that men require more than one woman for sexual satisfaction
(Caldwell, et al. 1993). Fourth, polygynous societies are often also characterized by
high rates of marital dissolution and the easy remarriage of widows and divorcees
(Goldman, et al. 1989; Halton, et al. 2003; Hertrich 2006; Pison 1986; Van de Walle
1990). This may lead to an increase in the total number of sexual partners over a man's
or a woman's lifetime.
On the other hand, it is sometimes argued that polygyny contains the spread of
HIV because it limits the incidence of extra-marital sex (Caldwell, et al. 1993; Carael,
et al. 2001; Mitsunaga, et al. 2005).5 The empirical evidence for that is mixed. Two
4
The empirical evidence for a concurrency effect on the spread of HIV and other STDs is, however, mixed.
In a study on the spread of Herpes Simplex, Halton and colleagues found that the risk of infection was as high
in women whose husbands were polygynous as in those whose husbands had a prior marriage (Halton, et al.
2003). This suggests that it is the number of partners one has had, and not necessarily the concurrency of
these relationship that affects the spread of STDs. This was also suggested by Lagarde and colleagues who
were not able to show that concurrency of sexual partnerships facilitates the spread of HIV (Lagarde, et al.
2001). Convincing evidence for a concurrency effect on HIV incidence and prevalence in the Rakai district in
rural Uganda could not be found either (Kelly 2001). In a study on Chlamydia transmission in Colorado,
however, concurrency was identified as the most powerful predictor of transmission (Potterat, et al. 1999).
5
A greater permissiveness of extra-marital sex is sometimes associated with the practice of prolonged post-
partum abstinence (Cleland, et al. 1999; Orubuloye, et al. 1997). Men in polygynous unions, however, could
change partners within marriage, and thus have less of an incentive to engage in non-marital sex than
monogamous men (Cleland, et al. 1999; Van de Walle 1990).
Demographic Research: Volume 19, Article 53
http://www.demographic-research.org 1813
studies found partial evidence that men (and women) in polygynous unions have more
extra-marital affairs than their counterparts in monogamous marriages (Carael, et al.
2001; Mitsunaga, et al. 2005). A study in Tanzania suggests that non-marital
partnerships are less common among polygynous men and more frequent among
women in polygynous unions (Nnko, et al. 2004).
In this article, we study the relationship between polygyny and HIV infection in
rural Malawi and try to disentangle the process that leads to different infection rates in
polygynous and monogamous unions. We first describe the relationship between
polygyny and HIV, and find that HIV prevalence is higher among those in polygynous
compared to monogamous unions. With that in mind, we investigate two mechanisms
that could lead to higher prevalence rates in men and women who are in polygynous
unions: (1) partners in polygynous unions have more extra-marital relationships and
thus increase each other's exposure to HIV; (2) women who are recruited into a
polygynous union are more likely to be HIV positive than those who marry a
monogamous husband. In addition to these two mechanisms, variation in HIV
prevalence rates by union type is also possibly due to a `polygyny-effect', or, in other
words, due to the fact that individuals in polygynous unions are part of a sexual
network with concurrent partnerships.
We study the first of these hypotheses using reports of spousal infidelity and assess
whether extra-marital sexual relationships are higher in polygynous compared to
monogamous unions. To test the second hypothesis we need to investigate selection of
spouses into polygynous marriages based on their HIV status. Because the sample size
and number of HIV positive cases is too small to permit such an analysis, we focus
instead on two risk factors of HIV, namely widowhood and marriage order. We thus
investigate whether widows are more often selected into polygynous unions than
divorcees and analyze whether marriage order correlates with selection into a
polygynous marriage. Both multiple marriages and widowhood are considered risk
factors for being HIV positive; an assumption for which we provide some evidence as
well.
2. Data
We use data from the adult samples of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change
project (MDICP). These are longitudinal survey data collected in the rural areas of three
districts with approximately 1,500 ever-married women and their husbands who have
Reniers & Tfaily: Polygyny and HIV in Malawi
http://www.demographic-research.org
1814
been interviewed in 1998 (MDICP1), in 2001 (MDICP2) and 2004 (MDICP3).6 In
2004 respondents were counseled and tested for HIV.7 HIV prevalence in the sample is
9.3 percent for women (95%-CI: 7.6-11.3) and 6.4 percent for men (95%-CI: 4.6-8.7).
Unless stated otherwise, we rely on retrospectively reported marriage histories collected
as part of MDICP2. For each respondent, these histories contain information on the
present (or most recent if not currently married), previous and first marriage. This
means that the marriage histories are incomplete for those who married more than three
times. This is not of great importance because only five and two percent of men and
women, respectively, have incomplete marriage histories. The dataset has information
on the beginning, duration and outcome of marriages, as well as on a number of
marriage characteristics such as the residence pattern during marriage, the age
difference between spouses, whether or not the husband is or was polygynous, and
whether there was any suspicion of spousal adultery.8 From these histories, we created
a dataset of marriages that will be used in several of the analyses that are presented
below. Compared to DHS surveys or censuses, which typically provide information on
current status, this is an exceptionally rich data source because it gives an insight into
the marriage trajectories rather than a snapshot in time. Retrospective reporting,
however, may be subject to bias because of the problematic reporting of ages and dates,
the ex post facto rationalization of decision-making processes, and possibly because of
a greater propensity to omit short unsuccessful unions from marriage histories as time
passes. Retrospective reporting also implies that the information is confined to those
who survived and were present at the time of the survey.
The sample is ethnically and religiously heterogeneous. Rumphi in the north is
characterized by a predominantly patrilineal system of descent with patrilocal residence
after marriage. The ethnic groups in Balaka in the south follow a matrilineal system of
filiation, and residence after marriage is most often matrilocal. In Mchinji, in the center
of the country, descent is less rigidly matrilineal, and residence may be either matrilocal
or patrilocal. The southern district is predominantly Muslim; Christians are in the
majority in the other two areas. The Tumbuka are the main ethnic group in Rumphi, the

Marriage outcome (if ended) is defined as either divorced or widowed. Separation is very rare and combined
with the category `divorced'. The measure of polygyny used in this article is based on two questions: (1)
whether or not the husband (or respondent if male) had any other wives at the time of marriage, and (2)
whether the husband (or respondent) married an additional wife (or wives) during the marriage under
consideration. A marriage is considered polygynous if any of those two questions was answered affirmatively.
The measure of suspected adultery is clarified in section 4.

Chewa in Mchinji, and the Yao in Balaka. Because of this cultural heterogeneity, we
control for district in most of our statistical models.
Marriage in Malawi is quasi-universal but divorce rates are high, with some
variation across the three research sites: in the south, over 50 percent of first marriages
dissolve within 15 years and in the two other districts, this figure is between 30 and 40
percent. Part of this discrepancy is related to the matrilineal system of filiation that
predominates in most southern ethnic groups wherein marriage dissolution is
traditionally higher (Reniers 2003).
3. Polygyny and HIV prevalence in Malawi
There are quite important regional differences in the level of polygyny. The percentage
of married women with one or more co-wives, and the percentage of married men with
more than one spouse are highest in the north and lowest in the southern region (Table
1). For a number of reasons, the indices of polygyny in the sample are higher than
those reported in the 2004 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) (NSO and ORC
Macro 2005). First, the MDICP sample is drawn from exclusively rural settings where
polygyny levels are generally higher. Second, in MDCIP1 the sampling frame consisted
of ever-married women and their husbands. In MDICP2 other and new spouses of
already sampled men and women were also interviewed, thereby increasing the share of
women married to a polygynous husband. Third, the measure of polygyny in the DHS
reflects current status, whereas the definition used here categorizes a marriage as
polygynous when the husband had another wife at any time during the marriage under
consideration (see also footnote 5). Fourth, the MDICP data pertain to all (i.e., current,
previous and first) marriages of men and women in the sample. If polygyny levels have
declined over time, the polygyny indices reported in Table 1 should be lower in the
Malawi DHS compared to MDICP data because the DHS only contains information on
the current marriage.9 Rather than a nuisance, however, the over-representation of
polygynous marriages in our sample is a convenient statistical feature because it
increases the power of statistical tests.
9
As shown in Table 1, the percentage of women with one or more co-wives declined between 1992 and 2004,
while the decline in the percentage of polygynous men during the same period was modest or non-existent. In
van de Walle's (Van de Walle 1968) terminology this suggests a decline in the intensity of polygyny (i.e., a
decrease in the average number of wives of each polygynyst) rather than a decline in the incidence of
polygyny (i.e., the proportion of married men with more than one wife). A decline in the fraction of women
with co-wives has been reported for several (not all) African countries (Antoine 2002; Westoff 2003).

In terms of HIV prevalence, the levels in the DHS sample are higher than those in
the MDICP. This is mainly because the latter pertain to an exclusively rural population.
The central region is an exception, and that is possibly due to the uncharacteristically
high refusal rates in the DHS survey in the central region (particularly in Lilongwe
where less than 40 percent of the respondents were tested) (NSO and ORC Macro
2005). Polygyny is most common in the district (Rumphi) where HIV infection rates
are the lowest. In Balaka, where HIV prevalence is the highest, polygyny is least
common. At the aggregate level, polygyny thus negatively correlates with HIV
prevalence. At the individual level the association is positive:10 the odds for being HIV
positive are 2.58 times (95%-CI: 1.34 - 4.94) higher among men who have ever been in
10 A similar, albeit reversed, disparity has previously been identified for the relationship between polygyny
and fertility (Ezeh 1997; Pebley and Mbugua 1989): these studies have found that women in polygynous
unions tend to have lower fertility than women in monogamous unions, but populations that practice
polygyny usually have higher fertility rates compared to populations where polygyny is uncommon.
Demographic Research: Volume 19, Article 53
http://www.demographic-research.org 1817
a polygynous union than among men who have not had any concurrent spouses. The
corresponding value for women is 2.00 (95%-CI: 1.30 - 3.08).11
These differences persist after controlling for district and age (Table 2, model 1).
This is particularly so for polygynous men who are about three times more likely to be
HIV positive than monogamously married men. The odds for being HIV positive are
significantly higher among women who have been ­or still are­ married to polygynous
husbands compared to women who have been in unions with monogamous husbands
only. That relationship appears to be stronger for second and third wives than for first
wives, but the differences are not statistically significant (p=0.18) and omitted from the
final model.
One of the mechanisms that could produce a difference in HIV prevalence rates in
polygynous and monogamous unions is a difference in the number of marriages. To test
whether this has an effect on HIV status and to verify whether it absorbs some of the
variance in HIV prevalence attributed to polygyny, we introduce marriage order as an
additional explanatory variable in the analyses. For women, having been married more
than once correlates significantly with HIV status, and reduces the effect of having ever
been in a polygynous marriage. Controlling for marriage order entirely absorbs the
effect ­if any­ of wife's rank (not shown). The parameter estimates for the polygyny
variable, however, remain significant, and that implies that marriage order alone cannot
explain the variance in prevalence rates by polygyny status.12
The test is less straightforward for men because polygyny implies multiple
partners by definition. In their case, we compare prevalence rates for those who are or
have been in precisely two formal unions and those who are or have been in at least
three marriages. The effects are of a similar magnitude as for women, but not
statistically significant; perhaps because the small sample size limits statistical power.
11 This positive association is also reproduced for each of the three districts separately. For men the
relationship is only statistically significant for Mchinji. There are, however, only 40 HIV positive men in the
sample and that contributes to the low statistical power of the tests. In the MDHS, the odds that a polygynous
man (current status) tested positive are lower than those for a monogamous man, but these values are not
statistically significant (OR: 0.65, 95%-CI: 0.39 - 1.14). For women, the value is closer to what we find in the
MDICP sample and statistically significant (OR: 1.49, 95%-CI: 1.08 - 2.06) (NSO and ORC Macro 2005).
12 Marriage order is strongly associated with the probability of marrying a polygynous husband (which ranges
from 34.81 percent for women in their first marriages to 76.60 percent for women in third or higher order
marriages). Marriage order is also correlated with the probability of becoming a second (or higher order-
ranked) wife of a polygynous husband (from 12.85 percent for women in first marriages to 56.03 percent for
those in second or higher order marriages) (not shown). This finding concurs with earlier reports that first and
higher order wives of polygynous husbands often have diverging characteristics (Timæus and Reynar 1998).

a For men, marriage order is defined irrespective of the outcome of the previous marriage. Analysis pertains to higher order
marriages only. The second marriage is the reference category.
So far, we have presented evidence that HIV prevalence rates are higher in
polygynous unions, and this does not seem to be a simple function of the respondent's
number of formal unions. In what follows we investigate two processes that could lead
to higher HIV prevalence in men and women in polygynous unions, namely differences
in (risky) sexual behavior between men and women in monogamous and polygynous
unions and the adverse selection of HIV positive women into polygynous unions.
Demographic Research: Volume 19, Article 53
http://www.demographic-research.org 1819
4. Polygyny and adultery
To test the association between polygyny and risky sexual behavior, we compare the
frequency of extra-marital sex in monogamous and polygynous unions. To do so we
rely on self reports of adultery and on spousal reports of ­the suspicion of­ adultery.
The suspicion of adultery was operationalized via the survey question: "During your
time together, did/do you suspect or know that your husband/wife had/has sexual
relations with other women/men apart from you". Women of polygynous men were
told that this did not include co-wives.13 The suspicion of spousal infidelity is reported
by women in 33.2 percent of the marriages and by men in 14.5 percent of the marriages.
Self-reports of adultery are lower: men report extra-marital affairs in 19.5 percent of the
marriages and women only in 2.5 percent of the cases. These percentages are virtually
the same if the analysis is restricted to first marriages only.
The statistical model that we use to test the association between polygyny and
adultery is a binary logistic regression where reported (suspicion of) adultery is the
outcome. We do this for both men (Table 3) and women (Table 4). Men who are in
polygynous marriages are 50 percent more likely to self-report extra-marital affairs than
men in monogamous unions, an effect that remains stable after controlling for
demographic, socioeconomic, and residence variables. The odds that women in
polygynous marriages suspect their husband of infidelity are about three times the odds
of women in monogamous unions. The effect becomes even stronger after controlling
for demographic and residency variables.
In terms of the control variables, we find that reports of male adultery decline with
an increasing age at marriage. The effect of marriage period suggests that adultery has
decreased over time (Reniers 2008). Educated men are about 66 percent more likely to
self-report infidelity than their uneducated counterparts, but education does not seem to
matter for spousal reports of adultery. Having a spouse who lives in the same village is
negatively associated with reports of adultery. This probably indicates that adultery is a
matter of opportunity and social control. Because its effect is only significant for
spousal reports of adultery and not self-reports, it may also be due to women's
uncertainty about the behavior of absent spouses. Regardless of the effects of these
controls, the main conclusion from this analysis remains that polygynous men more
often have extra-marital affairs (measured via self reports as well as reports by their
spouses), which could contribute to the difference in HIV prevalence rates between
individuals in polygynous and monogamous unions.
13 Unfortunately, the survey instructions did not include explicit guidelines for coding sex with women who
were to become future wives.

For women there does not seem to be any substantial difference in extra-marital
relationships between those in polygynous and monogamous unions: although the
parameter values point in the same direction as those for men, they are smaller and lack
statistical significance (Table 4). In Balaka, where the Yao follow a predominantly
matrilineal system of decent, the reports of female adultery are higher than in the other
two districts. This is consistent with anthropological commentary that women in
matrilineal groups exercise greater control over their sexuality and offspring (Caldwell,
et al. 1992). The other factors influencing infidelity among women are quite similar to
those for men: educated women are more likely to self-report extra-marital affairs than
their less educated counterparts, and reports of adultery are less common in recent
marriages, and when partners co-residence in the same village. Combined, Tables 3 and
4 thus provide evidence that polygynous men (but not women) are more likely to
engage in risky sexual behavior than monogamously married men and thus increase
their own as well as their spouses' risk of HIV infection.

5. Selection of HIV positive women into polygynous unions
A direct assessment of the selection of HIV positive women into polygynous unions
requires a measure of HIV status for all women at the time of marriage. Unfortunately,
these data are not available. Instead, we examine selection processes with respect to
characteristics that are measurable and that correlate with HIV status. One of them is
widowhood, and we therefore compare the likelihood that widows and divorcees
become part of a polygynous union. The odds for being HIV positive are about 78
percent higher (p=.12) for a widow than for a divorcee (controlling for district and
age).14 Adding an additional control for having been in a polygynous union barely
changes that relationship. For adverse selection into polygynous marriages to account
for (part of) the difference in HIV prevalence rates between polygynous and
monogamous households, women whose previous husband(s) died should be
disproportionately found in marriages with a polygynous husband.15
The other predictor that we consider is marriage order. Here we postulate that
marriage order correlates with HIV status (see Table 2), and that women at higher order
marriages are disproportionately recruited into marriages with polygynous men. In
14 In the 2004 Malawi DHS, HIV prevalence among the widowed (current status) was 35.5 percent (N=103)
and 23.3 percent among the divorced and separated (N=272) (NSO and ORC Macro 2005).
15 In a different study, remarriage rates of widows were found to be lower than those of divorcees (particularly
in the 1990s), most likely because an increasing share of widows are surviving spouses of AIDS victims and
therefore not very attractive marriage partners (Reniers 2008). In this article, we are merely interested in
explaining differences in HIV prevalence by marriage type. The analysis therefore conditions on remarriage.
Demographic Research: Volume 19, Article 53
http://www.demographic-research.org 1823
these analyses we define a polygynous husband as someone who had at least one other
spouse at the time of marriage. The tests for both of these selection processes are
carried out by means of a binary logistic regression model whereby the marriage type is
the outcome of interest and widowhood (versus divorced status, Table 5, model 1) and
marriage order (Table 5, model 2) are the predictors.
In addition to our earlier finding that the prevalence of polygyny varies by district,
we learn from Table 5 that the frequency of polygynous marriages increases with
women's age at marriage: the older a woman, the more likely she is to marry a
polygynist. The quadratic effect for age at marriage indicates that the odds of marrying
a polygynous husband follow a curvilinear pattern with an inflection point around age
36. Widows are, as expected, more likely to remarry a polygynous husband, but the
effect is relatively small and not statistically significant.16
The effect of marriage order is much stronger and highly significant: the odds that
a woman will marry a polygynous husband are about three times higher in a second
marriage than in a first marriage, and the association gains strength with marriage order.
Interestingly, marriage order is also a better predictor of HIV status than widowhood
(when compared to divorce). In these analyses, we thus find support for the proposition
that HIV positive women are more likely to be selected into polygynous marriages than
monogamous unions.
16 The lack of a strong effect is also an indication that levirate or widow inheritance is probably not very
important in Malawi (at least not to the extent that it would lead to noticeable differences between widows
and divorcees in their likelihood of remarrying a polygynous husband). Because levirate is uncommon in
ethnic groups with matrilineal descent systems, we tested for an interaction (not statistically significant)
between widowed and district.

a Analysis pertains to higher order marriages only
Variable definitions: Age at marriage: age at marriage of the respondent (i.e., the wife); widow: whether the woman's previous
marriage ended in widowhood or divorce/separation; Marriage order: 1st marriage (reference category), 2nd marriage, or higher
order marriage of the wife.
Models selection: The interaction between marriage period and outcome of the previous marriage is insignificant (indicating no
significant change in the selection of widows into polygynous unions over time). The interaction effect between marriage period
and marriage order seems to suggest that women in their third marriage or above are selected into polygynous households
more often in the 1990s than was the case before that period. This effect, however, does not reach statistical significance either
(z=1.04). Both interactions are omitted from the final model.

6. Discussion
We began with the observation that HIV prevalence rates in Malawi are higher among
those who have been in a polygynous union compared to those who have been in
monogamous marriages only. We proposed and tested two mechanisms that could
produce such a difference and found evidence for each of those processes. First,
polygynously married men more often engage in extra-marital affairs than monogamous
men, a result that holds for both self-reports and spousal suspicion of adultery. For
women, the evidence points in a similar direction but does not reach the same level of
statistical significance. Our data do not allow us to investigate why polygynous men are
presumably less faithful than monogamous men. Possible explanations are that these
men have a greater disposition for multiple partners, that they are searching for new
spouses, or, that they experience less objection from their current wife or wives.
Selection is another avenue that can produce higher HIV prevalence rates in polygynous
unions. Although our evidence is indirect, women who are more likely to be HIV
positive (e.g., women who have been married before) more often join polygynous
unions. An alternative explanation for the relatively high HIV prevalence in members
of polygynous unions, namely the concurrency of sexual relationships, can be neither
rejected nor confirmed with the available data.
A puzzling feature of the study site is that the highest HIV prevalence rates are
found in the district where polygyny is least common (and vice versa). Using the
evidence at hand, it is not possible to explain the difference in individual and aggregate-
level correlations between polygyny and HIV.17 Unobserved factors are a likely
candidate, but a more intriguing hypothesis is one that implies a strong selection of HIV
positive individuals into polygynous households. As we have observed in this study,
this could contribute to a positive individual-level correlation between polygyny and
HIV. However, if the selection is strong and the sexual networks of men and women
who are in polygynous unions are sufficiently distinct from those who are in
monogamous unions, they could have the potential to contain aggregate HIV prevalence
rates in populations where polygyny is practiced compared to those that are more
exclusively monogamous. Another factor that may help to contain the spread of HIV in
populations that practice polygyny is a reduction in the frequency of intercourse in
conjugal units of polygynous marriages. Such a coital dilution effect has been
recognized early on in studies of differential fertility in polygynous and monogamous
marriages (Musham 1956), and it might as well affect HIV incidence in serodiscordant
couples with a polygynous husband.
17
Incidentally, HIV prevalence is also much lower in western Africa where polygyny rates are usually much
higher than in the eastern and southeastern Africa. A similar observation has been made by Frank (1992).
