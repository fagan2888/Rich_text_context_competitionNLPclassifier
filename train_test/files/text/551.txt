abstract
OBJECTIVES: In the context of a group randomized field trial, we evaluated whether parents who
participated in a workplace intervention, designed to increase supervisor support for personal and
family life and schedule control, reported significantly more daily time with their children at the
12-month follow-up compared with parents assigned to the Usual Practice group. We also tested
whether the intervention effect was moderated by parent gender, child gender, or child age.
METHODS: The Support-Transform-Achieve-Results Intervention was delivered in an information
technology division of a US Fortune 500 company. Participants included 93 parents (45%
mothers) of a randomly selected focal child aged 9 to 17 years (49% daughters) who completed
daily telephone diaries at baseline and 12 months after intervention. During evening telephone
calls on 8 consecutive days, parents reported how much time they spent with their child that day.
RESULTS: Parents in the intervention group exhibited a significant increase in parent-child shared
time, 39 minutes per day on average, between baseline and the 12-month follow-up. By
contrast, parents in the Usual Practice group averaged 24 fewer minutes with their child per
day at the 12-month follow-up. Intervention effects were evident for mothers but not for
fathers and for daughters but not sons.
CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that the intervention would improve parents' daily time with their
children was supported. Future studies should examine how redesigning work can change the quality
of parent-child interactions and activities known to be important for youth health and development.
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Children's
time with parents is critical for healthy
development. Lack of control over parents'
schedules and limited supervisor support for
personal and family life can interfere with
parents' family time.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is the first group
randomized controlled field trial demonstrating
effects of a workplace intervention, designed to
increase schedule control and supervisor
support, on working parents' time with their
children, as assessed by using longitudinal daily
telephone interviews.

Time with parents is a significant
factor in children's health and
development. Shared activities
promote close, nurturing
relationships that are critical for
youths' psychological and behavioral
adjustment1­3 and for their ability to
develop close relationships with
peers and romantic partners.4,5
Parent-child shared time also affords
opportunities for parents to monitor
their children's activities and deter
health risk behaviors,6 promote
healthful eating and exercise,7,8
arrange health care appointments,9,10
and foster skills and knowledge that
are important for youths' current and
future successes.11
With longer work days and commute
times, more nonstandard work
schedules, and greater work stress, it
is more difficult to be a parent today
than in the past.12 Parents' time at
work necessarily limits time to invest
in children, and today's US working
parents often report feeling the time
squeeze, that is, insufficient time to
fulfill responsibilities for both work
and family.13 Cultural standards set
a high bar for what constitutes
sufficient time with children and
can place a strain on parents,
increasing their feelings of work-
family conflict and time inadequacy.14
Yet, public and workplace policies are
limited and mismatched in meeting
the needs of working parents, needs
that ultimately affect the welfare
of children.12,15
Most research on parents' work and
time with their children shows that
longer work hours are associated
with less parent-child time.16 The
correlational designs of this research,
however, mean that conclusions
about causal associations between
work involvement or workplace
conditions and parent-child shared
time cannot be drawn. One exception
is a study of a workplace initiative in
a white collar organization that
improved mothers' and fathers'
perceptions of adequacy of time with
their children; however, this study did
not assess parents' actual time with
children.17 Most research in this area
focuses on working parents with
young children; we know little about
the effects of parents' work on
adolescent-aged offspring.
Adolescents' increasing autonomy
and involvement in the world beyond
the family mean that parents and
adolescents spend less time together
than in childhood.18 However,
adolescents' time with parents
remains important for their
development,19 and work policies
and practices that allow parents to be
responsive to their adolescents'
schedules may promote parent-youth
shared time.
The Work, Family, and Health Study
(WFHS) builds on previous research
to evaluate the effects of a workplace
intervention designed to increase 2
resources: supportive supervisor
behaviors for personal and family life
and schedule control. Our hypotheses
were that increases in work resources
would reduce employees' work-
family conflict and, in turn, benefit
their health and family lives. Our
study is situated within the work-
home resource model,20 which holds
that work demands deplete parental
resources, including time and energy,
thereby influencing parents' family
functioning. Correspondingly, work
resources, such as supervisor support
for personal and family life and
schedule control can increase
personal resources, with positive
implications for family role
performance, including increased
time with children.21 We
hypothesized that parents in the
intervention condition would exhibit
significantly more daily time with
their children 1 year after
intervention, compared with parents
who were randomly assigned to the
Usual Practice (UP) condition. We
also tested whether intervention
effects varied as a function of parent
gender, youth gender, or youth age. In
line with gender role socialization
that highlight the social and kinship
orientations of women and girls,22 we
expected that the intervention would
be most effective for mothers and for
daughters. In line with developmental
research that stresses youths'
increasing involvement in the world
beyond the family, we expected that
the intervention would be more
effective in the case of older
adolescents.23
METHOD
Study Design
The WFHS is a group randomized,
field experiment conducted in an
information technology division of
a US Fortune 500 company. We tested
the effects of the STAR (Support-
Transform-Achieve-Results)
intervention, which was designed to
promote a supportive work culture by
increasing supervisor support for
personal and family life and schedule
control.24,25 The STAR intervention
was introduced by executives as
a company-sponsored pilot program.
The intervention was developed
jointly by our research team and
outside consultants who customized
the materials for this work force. In
an additional effort to keep the data
collection and intervention separate,
4 facilitators delivered the STAR
intervention to supervisors and
employees, and a separate group of
research staff, blind to participants'
experimental assignment, was
responsible for data collection.24,25
Fifty-six groups of information
technology workers who reported to
the same manager were randomized
to either the intervention (STAR), or
UP conditions. STAR involved
facilitated training sessions (6
manager training sessions, 4
employee sessions) across a 4-month
period. The sessions were designed to
change work culture to focus on work
results rather than when and where
people perform their work,17 that is,
valuing work productivity rather than
face time. In addition, managers
completed a 1-hour computer-based
training that focused on providing
876 DAVIS et al
emotional and instrumental support
for employees facing family and
personal demands, modeling effective
work-family management, and
identifying creative work-family
management strategies.26 Managers
also were instructed to track their
supportive behaviors by using the
weSupport Behavior Tracking
application. Research staff blinded to
participants' group assignment
conducted workplace interviews at
baseline and 6, 12, and 18 months
post-STAR. The WFHS was approved
by several internal review boards. A
detailed description of the
intervention design and protocol has
been published elsewhere.27 All of
the intervention materials can be
found on the following Web site:
www.workfamilyhealthnetwork.org.
Of the 823 employees who completed
workplace interviews, 222 (26.97%)
were eligible for home interviews
because they were a parent of a child
aged 9 to 17 who lived at home for at
least 4 days a week and who was
willing to participate in a home
interview. Of the 147 employees who
completed the baseline home
interview, 131 participated in an 8-
day daily telephone diary study at
baseline (89.12%) and 99 (67.34%)
participated at both baseline and the
12-month follow-up. The attriters (n
= 32) did not differ from those who
completed both the baseline and 12-
month diary assessments (n = 99) in
basic demographic information (eg,
age, education, household income,
number of children living in the
home) or the target intervention
variables (ie, schedule control and
supervisor support for personal and
family life; Fig 1). Over the course of 8
consecutive evenings, participants
completed interviews assessing daily
mood, health, work and family
experiences, and time use. In addition
to its ecological validity, the daily
diary method reduces recall biases
that can occur when parents provide
global reports of their time use over
extended periods.28 Parents
completed 7.81 (SD = 0.47)
interviews, on average, at baseline,
and averaged 7.92 (SD = 0.30) of 8
interviews at the 12-month follow-up.
They received $150 and $200 for
participation at baseline and 12
months, respectively.
Participants
Analyses used the subsample of 93
parents (STAR = 57, UP = 36; 45%
mothers) who participated in the
diary study at baseline and 12
months. Most were college-educated,
with annual household incomes .
$100 000 (Table 1). Target children
averaged 13 years of age, and about
half were girls.
Measures
Daily parent-child time was assessed
on each of 8 consecutive evenings
with the following question: "Since
this time yesterday, how much time
did you spend taking care of or doing
things with [TARGET CHILD NAME],
such as helping with homework,
playing with him/her, driving him/
her around, or doing something else
with him/her?" Time was converted
to minutes per day.
The independent variables to test the
intervention effect were Condition (0
= UP, 1 = STAR), Wave (0 = baseline,
1 = 12 months after assessment), and
their interaction. Covariates included
diary day (range = 1­8, centered at
day 1), whether the youth was on
summer vacation (0 = no, 1 = yes),
mean number of school days across
the 8 diary days at each wave, mean
number of parent work days at each
wave, parent and youth gender (0 =
girls, 1 = boys), and youth age
(centered at the grand mean at
baseline). During the study rollout,
the firm experienced a merger, which
affected some employees; we
included an indicator variable for
FIGURE 1

rr, response rate.
PEDIATRICS Volume 135, number 5, May 2015 877
merger experience (0 = no, 1 = yes).
We tested whether the subsample of
employees who consented to
participate in the diary study were
comparable on demographic
characteristics (parent gender, parent
age, parent education, child gender,
child age, marital status, number of
children living in home, household
income), general work characteristics
(work hours, tenure at company), and
the intervention targets: supervisor
support for personal and family life21
and schedule control.17 The STAR and
UP diary groups differed only on
parents' schedule control at baseline,
measured by an 8-item scale in the
workplace interview (eg, "How much
choice do you have over when you
begin and end work each day?"),29
and so this measure was added as
a covariate.
Statistical Analyses
We used intent-to-treat analyses.30
We created an interaction term
between wave and intervention
condition (UP, STAR) to indicate
whether the 2 groups differed in the
extent of change in daily parent-child
time from baseline to 12 months. To
account for the clustering of
observations within persons, we
tested multilevel models using SAS
Proc Mixed (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary,
NC). For significant interactions,
simple slopes tests were used to
determine if increases or decreases
were significantly different from
zero.31
RESULTS
Main Effects of the STAR Intervention
Compared with UP parents, those in
STAR increased in parent-child time
from baseline to the 12-month follow-
up, B = 62.44, 95% confidence
interval (CI) = 30.76 to 64.13
(Table 2). This increase, an average of
39 minutes per day, was significant, B
= 38.60, P , .01. By contrast, parents
in the UP condition averaged 24
fewer minutes per day with their
children, B = ­23.84, P = .06 from
baseline to follow-up.
Moderation Analyses
Parent gender, B = ­113.03, 95% CI =
­176.68 to 49.38, and youth gender, B
= ­78.49, 95% CI = ­141.67 to 15.31,
but not youth age, were significant
moderators of the intervention effect.
First, the intervention was more
effective in increasing mother-child
time than father-child time (Fig 2).
Mothers in the intervention group
exhibited a significant increase in
shared time from baseline to the 12-
month follow-up to 58 minutes per
day, B = 23.93, 95% CI = ­27.13 to
88.62. By contrast, mothers in the UP
group exhibited a significant
decrease: approximately 70 minutes
per day, B = ­69.53, 95% CI = ­106.29
to 32.77. Increases in intervention-
group fathers' time reached trend
level, B = 23.93, 95% CI = ­3.07 to
50.94, but there was no change
among fathers in the UP group and no
significant group difference in
changes in fathers' time, B = ­9.56,
95% CI = ­22.58 to 41.70. The
intervention also was more effective
in increasing parent-daughter relative
to parent-son time (Fig 3). Parents in
the intervention group exhibited
a significant increase from baseline to
the 12-month follow-up, 70 minutes
per day, in time with daughters, B =
70.23, 95% CI = 41.03 to 99.43,
whereas parents in the UP group
declined by 34 minutes, B = ­33.79,
95% CI = ­70.55 to 2.97. There were
no group differences in change in
shared time for parents of sons.
DISCUSSION
Changing parents' work (by
increasing schedule control and
supervisor's support for employees'
personal and family life) can facilitate
more time with children, a significant
intervention outcome given previous
research on the role of parental time
in their children's healthy
development.1­11 This is the first
study to demonstrate that
a workplace intervention designed to
train managers to be supportive of
employees' personal and family
life21,26 and increase employees'
control over when and where they
work17 can increase employees' time
with their children. Parents in the
STAR intervention reported an
average of 39 minutes more time per
day or 4.5 hours per week with their
child at 1 year after intervention. By
contrast, parents randomly assigned
to UP exhibited declines in time with

their children over the same period,
declines that would be expected given
the increasing autonomy of
adolescents.18 Youths' increasing
involvement in the world beyond the
home, in combination with parents'
demanding work schedules, may
create special challenges for parents'
time with adolescent-aged children.
Close parent-child relationships
remain important, however, in
protecting youth from the increases
in adjustment problems and health
risk behaviors that often emerge
during this developmental period.32
By providing parents with support
from managers and flexibility in when
and where to complete their work,
our results suggest that the STAR
intervention opened up opportunities
for parents to remain connected to
their adolescents.
Changes in parent-child time were
more apparent for mothers than for
fathers. Mothers in STAR increased
nearly 1 hour per day by the 12-
month follow-up, whereas UP
mothers declined by more than an
hour per day in time with their child.
Although the simple slopes test
revealed a trend-level increase in
parent-child time for fathers in STAR,
they did not differ significantly from
UP fathers. Past decades have
witnessed increases in fathers' time
with children, but cultural scripts
regarding mothers' role as caregiver
and fathers' role as breadwinner
remain pervasive34 and mothers still
spend more time than fathers.33 One
strategy mothers use is limiting their
time on personal activities.14
Important to note is that mothers in
this sample did not work significantly
fewer hours per week (baseline
means: 46.24 and 46.59 hours per
week for mothers and fathers,
respectively), and work hours did not
significantly change for either
mothers or fathers. Thus, mothers
may have been more inclined to take
advantage of the opportunities and
supports afforded by STAR to spend
time with their children.
Our findings on youth gender
moderation suggest that children, too,
play an important role in these
processes: daughters may be more
inclined than sons to seek out their
parents or be seen by their parents as
more available for and amenable to
conversations and companionate
activities. Indeed, research on
developmental changes in parent-
child time has shown that, across
adolescence, mother-daughter dyads
spend more time together than dyads
of any other gender constellation,35
and our findings fit with this pattern.
This finding could also reflect
parenting practices that tend to keep
daughters under closer supervision
than sons.36 The sample size limited
our ability to test whether mother-
daughter dyads showed the largest
increase in shared time compared
with other parent-child gender
constellations; this is a direction for
future research.
Taken together, our findings are
consistent with the work-home
resource model,20 which holds that
work demands deplete resources but
that work resources can increase
parents' resources, including time,
with positive implications for family
role performance. Early results
showed that the STAR intervention
improved 2 workplace resources
(supportive supervisor behaviors and
schedule control27) and our analyses

tervention and UP groups.

revealed that it also increased
employees' time with children. By
promoting schedule control in the
context of supervisor support, STAR
may have provided more flexibility
for parents to spend time when their
adolescent-aged offspring were
available, and such time investments
are known to have positive
downstream implications for youth
adjustment.1­11
Important to note is that this study
tested the effects of a workplace
intervention on quantity but not
quality of parent-child time. Although
more time together brings
opportunities for positive parent-
child experiences, it does not
guarantee them. The autonomy of
adolescence, however, means that
youths have increasing opportunities
to avoid spending time with their
parents when shared time is not
rewarding, and further, there is
evidence that the quantity of parent-
child shared time is linked to
adjustment measures, such as self-
esteem and peer social competence in
adolescence.35 Other research
identified specific activities, such as
family meals, assisting with
homework, and discussing daily
activities, that are linked to positive
youth outcomes,37,38 and thus
determining whether and what
workplace resources promote
involvement in particular kinds of
activities or interactions is a direction
for future study.
In this study, we used parents' rather
than youths' daily reports of shared
time. Although our daily measure
reduces memory distortions and
social desirability biases because
reports focus on a single day, future
research should take youths'
perspectives into account. Reports
from individuals not directly involved
in the intervention (such as youths or
spouses) would provide confidence
that behavioral changes are due to the
intervention and not placebo-type
effects. Although using a more
traditional time diary approach could
provide more accurate reports of time
use than end-of-day reports,39 the
latter approach was more viable for
a sample of working parents with
limited time. We also focused on
parents' time with 1 "target child,"
aged 9 to 17 who lived at home for at
least 4 days per week, and thus our
findings are not generalizable to
youths in other age groups or family
circumstances. Another important
direction for research is to test the
effects of efforts to increase
supervisor support for personal and
family life and schedule control in
work organizations and industries
beyond the white-collar context we
studied. Finally, although our
previous research documented
significant increases in family
supportive supervisor behavior and
schedule control and decreases in
work-family conflict in the
intervention group relative to the UP
group,40 a next step is to identify the
mechanisms through which the
intervention affected parent-child
shared time.
In the face of some limitations, our
research advances understanding of
the effects of parents' work on family
life. Most importantly, the design
allows for causal inferences about the
effects of the intervention, leading to
the conclusion that workplace
practices can have positive effects in
employees' family lives and benefit
their children. Using daily
measurements, we were able to
document with precision the effects
of the intervention on a key
dimension of parent-child
relationship quality (how much time
youth spend with their parents) that
is critical for youth health and
adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS
By using an experimental design and
daily measurement, we documented
that the effects of a workplace
intervention spilled over to affect
employees' family lives in the form of
increases in parents' time
investments in their children. Our
results were consistent with theory
and previous, largely correlational
findings in suggesting that workplace
changes that target 2 key workplace
resources (supervisor support for
personal and family life and employee
schedule control) can help to mitigate
the often conflicting demands and
responsibilities of work and family.

THE SMELL OF SUMMER RAIN: All my life I have enjoyed the smell of a gentle
summer rain. I associate it with warm days, dry earth, and walks with my family.
I had always assumed that the smell of rain was due to the rain water itself. After
all, everyone says they can smell the rain. It turns out that the smell of rain is actually
the smell of the earth. To my surprise, scientists have known since the 1960s that
the scent we associate with rain is actually the smell of the soil and is called petrichor.
What scientists have not known is how the soil smell gets into the air.
As reported in The New York Times (Science: January 26, 2015), scientists studying
the absorption ofwater dropsby various surfaces,includingsoil, noticed that under
certain conditions, tiny bubbles were released after a water drop hit the ground.
Usinghighspeedvideotheylearnedthatthesizeofthedrop,velocityofthedrop,and
typeofsoilall hadagreatdealofimpactonwhether airbubbles werereleased. Rain
drops of just the right size, falling at just the right speed, on the right type of dry soil
trap tiny air bubbles beneath it. As the drop collapses, the bubbles, embedded with
molecules from the soil, burst out. The molecules in the air bubbles give the familiar
scent we associate with rain. While this is intriguing, I suspect however, that I will
continue tosaythatIlikethe smellofrain.The "smellofsoil"orthe"petrichorscent"
just does not have the same ring.
