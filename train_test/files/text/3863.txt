It is widely acknowledged that regular exercise is associated
with significant physiological and psychological benefits
(Warburton, Nicol, & Bredin, 2006; Williams, 2001).
However, in many westernized countries, less than half the
population meet the minimum recommended physical activ-
ity requirements to achieve these health benefits (e.g.,
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2010; Canadian
Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute, 2004; U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2003). As such,
investigating ways of increasing exercise is a concern within
health psychology (e.g., Hagger & Armitage, 2004; Hagger,
Chatzisarantis, & Biddle, 2002a; Jones, Sinclair, Rhodes, &
Courneya, 2004; Rhodes,& Nasuti,2011). The focus of this
research is to identify the socio-cognitive factors that predict
exercise intentions and behavior and provide a psychological
account of how these factors determine behavior. Advancing
theories in this way is important as successful manipulation
of these factors via health promotion and communication
may be useful in increasing the rates of exercise (Armitage &
Conner, 2000).
Several models have been proposed to explain health
behaviors. Two prominent models are the Theory of Planned
Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1985, 1987) and the Extended
Parallel Process Model (EPPM; Witte, 1992a). Both these
models have been utilized to explain health behavior and
intentions to engage in health behavior. Intention refers to
the strength of the motivation or desire to engage in a par-
ticular behavior (Ajzen, 1991). Embedded in both models is
the assumption that an individual's intention to engage in a
particular health behavior is a proximal predictor of engage-
ment in that behavior (Ajzen, 1991; Witte, 1994). As such,
intentions are often used as the dependent variable of interest
rather than actual behavior change (e.g., Abraham, Sheeran,
& Henderson, 2011; Armitage & Conner, 2000; Godin &
Kok, 1996; Hagger & Armitage, 2004; Hagger et al., 2002a).
However, meta-analytic reviews suggest that neither model
can explain all or even most of the variance in either behav-
ioral intentions or health behavior change (e.g., Armitage &
Conner, 2001; Floyd, Prentice-Dunn, & Rogers, 2000;
Hagger et al., 2002a; Milne, Sheeran, & Orbell, 2000; Witte
& Allen, 2000).
The literature primarily focuses on testing and utilizing
existing theory to predict intentions and health behavior.

A Case for Theoretical Integration:
Combining Constructs From the Theory
of Planned Behavior and the Extended
Parallel Process Model to Predict Exercise
Intentions
Jay A. Richards1 and Martin P. Johnson1
Abstract
The present research investigated whether constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Extended Parallel
Process Model can be integrated into a model that can better explain intentions to exercise than the TPB constructs alone.
A total of 336 participants completed measures of constructs from both theories and past exercise behavior. Hierarchical
regression analyses revealed that attitudes, subjective norms, susceptibility, self-efficacy, and past behavior contributed
unique variance to a model that predicted intentions to exercise. This model explained a greater proportion of the variance
in exercise intentions than the TPB alone. Relationships between key variables of both models were also highlighted.
Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

Most often, one theory is selected to guide the choice of
explanatory and outcome variables as if the other theories
did not exist (Weinstein, 1993). Several researchers have
lamented that there is a lack of research comparing compet-
ing theories or augmenting existing theories (Noar &
Zimmerman, 2005; Ogden, 2003; Weinstein, 1993, 2007;
Weinstein & Rothman, 2005; see Conner & Armitage, 1998;
Dodge, Stock, & Litt, 2013; Dolman & Chase, 1996; Godin
& Kok, 1996; Hagger et al., 2002a; Murray-Johnson et al.,
2006, for some notable exceptions). Failing to compare or
adjust existing theory means that it fails to naturally evolve,
and as such our understanding of the socio-cognitive factors
which determine health behavior change (and the mediators
of health behavior change) does not improve (Weinstein &
Rothman, 2005).
Several researchers have advocated taking a broader
approach to predicting health behavior change by utilizing
constructs from several theoretical perspectives--namely,
theoretical integration (e.g., Hagger, 2009, 2010; Noar &
Zimmerman, 2005). Bringing together the constructs with
the most research support into a single model may yield a
model which can explain a larger proportion of the variance
than any single model alone. In many cases, the similarities
between models of health behavior outweigh the differences
(Hagger, 2009, 2010; Weinstein, 2007). Therefore, to reduce
redundancy, only dissimilar models should be integrated.
Two models which stand out as being different from one
another, while still explaining a large proportion of the vari-
ance in health behavior change, are the TPB and EPPM.
Main Theoretical Perspectives
The TPB
According to the TPB (Ajzen, 1985, 1987, 1991), intentions
and perceived behavioral control (PBC) are the proximal
predictors of behavior. PBC refers to an individual's appraisal
of how much control they have over adopting a particular
behavior (Ajzen, 1991, 2002). This is determined by the indi-
vidual considering the relevant resources they have available
to them (i.e., requisite skills, social support, disposable
income, etc.) and determining whether these are sufficient to
overcome any barriers they anticipate in the performance of
the behavior. Ajzen argues that if people believe that they
will be successful in performing the behavior, they will be
more likely to expend greater effort in adopting it (cf.
Bandura, 1977, 1982, 1991). PBC is only likely to be an
important predictor of behavior when behaviors are some-
what difficult or effortful to perform.
An individual's intentions are determined by their atti-
tudes, subjective norms, and PBC. One's attitude toward a
behavior refers to their appraisal (positive or negative) of
their performing the behavior. Beliefs contributing to the for-
mation of an attitude include the expected outcomes of
engaging in the behavior (behavioral beliefs) and whether or
not these outcomes are appraised as favorable or unfavorable
(subjective evaluation; Ajzen, 1991). More positive attitudes
are generated when expected outcomes are appraised as
favorable. Subjective norms refer to the "perceived social
pressure to perform or not perform the behaviour" (Ajzen,
1991, p. 188). The beliefs which determine subjective norms
are the perceived likelihood that important people in the indi-
vidual's life (e.g., friends, family members, medical profes-
sionals) will approve or disapprove of them engaging in a
particular behavior, and their motivation to comply with each
important other's wishes. According to the TPB, an individ-
ual is most likely to intend to perform health protective
behaviors if they believe that (a) the behaviors are associated
with favorable outcomes, (b) important others will approve,
and (c) they have a high level of control over whether the
behavior is adopted.
The TPB has received much research interest and has
been found to be useful in explaining a variety of health
behaviors including exercise (e.g., Armitage & Conner,
2001; Chatzisarantis, Hagger, Wang, & Thøgersen-
Ntoumani, 2009; Godin & Kok, 1996; Hagger et al., 2002a;
Hausenblas, Carron, & Mack, 1997; Murnaghan et al., 2010).
Meta-analytic reviews have found that, on the whole, TPB
explains 39% to 51% of the variance in behavioral intentions
and 26% to 34% of the variance in health behavior (Armitage
& Conner, 2001; Godin & Kok, 1996; Hagger, Chatzisarantis,
& Biddle, 2002b; McEachan, Conner, Taylor, & Lawton,
2011). Therefore, although the TPB explains a large propor-
tion of the variance in intentions and behavior, a significant
amount of variance remains unexplained, suggesting that
other predictors may exist which could explain this missing
variance.
EPPM
The EPPM (Witte, 1992a) was designed to explain responses
following exposure to a fear provoking health message--or a
fear appeal (Witte, 1992a). Fear appeals generally consist of
two elements: an explicit threat to health (e.g., "obesity
increases your chances of heart disease") and a recom-
mended response which will alleviate that threat ("exercise
for 30 min 5 times per week"). However, many of the prin-
ciples of the EPPM can be applied outside of a fear appeal
context to explain how individuals are likely to respond to a
perceived health threat (e.g., Rimal, 2001; Rimal, Böse,
Brown, Mkandawire, & Folda, 2009; Rimal, Brown, et al.,
2009; Rimal & Real, 2003; Turner, Rimal, Morrison, & Kim,
2006). Witte (1992a) theorized that responses to a health
threat are a function of two appraisal processes: threat
appraisal and efficacy appraisal (cf. Lazarus & Folkman,
1984). During the threat appraisal, individuals evaluate fac-
tors associated with the health threat, including feelings con-
cerning the seriousness of a health threat (severity) and the
likelihood of their being affected (susceptibility). The effi-
cacy appraisal evaluates factors associated with a possible
Richards and Johnson 3
response to the threat including beliefs regarding the effec-
tiveness of the response in reducing the health threat
(response-efficacy) and a conviction that they can succeed in
adopting the response (self-efficacy; cf. Bandura, 1977).
According to the EPPM, when a health threat is appraised
as trivial (low severity) or irrelevant (low susceptibility), no
fear is elicited and there is no motivation to respond to the
fear appeal or continue to attend to its message. Thus, low
threat messages are unlikely to lead to adaptive behavior
change, regardless of the efficacy level (Witte, 1992a).
However, when a health threat is appraised as harmful and
relevant, fear is elicited (e.g., Maddux & Rogers, 1983;
Rippetoe & Rogers, 1987; Rogers & Mewborn, 1976; Witte,
1992b, 1994; Witte & Allen, 2000). This fear motivates a
consideration of possible responses to the health threat (effi-
cacy appraisal; cf. Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). When a par-
ticular response is believed to be effective in alleviating the
health threat (high response-efficacy) and easy to perform
(high self-efficacy), the individual should become motivated
to protect themselves from the health threat. This protection
motivation should in turn stimulate acceptance of the
response (i.e., adaptive attitude, intention, and behavior
change; Witte, 1992a; Witte & Allen, 2000). Therefore, the
EPPM predicts that when individuals perceive themselves to
be susceptible to a severe health threat, and believe that
adopting a particular behavior will be effective in alleviating
that health threat, they are likely to hold positive attitudes
and intend to adopt that behavior (see Witte, 1992a, for a
fuller explication of the predictions of the EPPM).
Meta-analyses reveal that the five key variables (fear,
severity, susceptibility, response-efficacy, and self-efficacy)
of the EPPM each have positive associations with behavioral
intentions and behavior change (Floyd et al., 2000; Milne et
al., 2000; Witte & Allen, 2000). However, on the whole,
effect sizes range from no effect to moderate (r = .07-.36;
Milne et al., 2000). Self-efficacy, response-efficacy, and fear
are generally stronger predictors of intentions and behavior
than severity or susceptibility (Milne et al., 2000; Witte &
Allen, 2000). Research findings suggest that perceptions of
threat and efficacy account for 20% to 56% of the variance in
intentions and 19% to 46% of the variance in health behavior
(e.g., Hodgkins & Orbell, 1998; Maddux & Rogers, 1983;
Melamed, Rabinowitz, Feiner, Weisberg, & Ribak, 1996;
Plotnikoff & Higginbotham, 1995, 1998, 2002; Plotnikoff,
Trinh, Courneya, Karunamuni, & Sigal, 2009; Rogers &
Mewborn, 1976; Stanley & Maddux, 1986; Van der Velde &
Van der Pligt, 1991). Although these findings are impressive,
there is still a large proportion of the variance which is left
unexplained by the model. Therefore, other variables may
need to be considered if a more complete explanation of
health behavior is to be realized.
The Case for Theoretical Integration
The present study aims to investigate the utility of taking a
more comprehensive approach to predicting exercise
intentions by utilizing constructs from two socio-cognitive
models as predictors. The study will investigate whether
adding perceived susceptibility, severity, self-efficacy, and
response-efficacy to the TPB increases its explanatory power
for predicting intentions to exercise. Hagger (2009) identi-
fied three arguments in favor of theoretical integration; it can
eliminate gaps in theories, reduce redundancy, and increase
parsimony. Both the TPB and EPPM contain different
explanatory variables (Ajzen, 1985, 1987; Witte, 1992a), but
each still explains a significant proportion of the variance in
health behavior intentions (e.g., Armitage & Conner, 2001;
McEachan et al., 2011; Witte & Allen, 2000). Therefore, it is
possible that constructs from the EPPM may be able to fill
explanatory gaps in the TPB, and vice versa, highlighting
redundancies and unnecessary variables between theories.
Therefore, theoretical integration may help streamline health
promotion campaigns by identifying the most important
variables to manipulate (Hagger, 2009). Other researchers
agree that combining social-cognitive models may be a use-
ful next step in the development of health behavior theory
(Armitage & Conner, 2000; Fishbein et al., 2001; Maddux,
1993; Plotnikoff, Rhodes, & Trinh, 2009). To date, no
research has attempted to combine variables from the TPB
and EPPM to explain exercise intentions.
Integrating Ideas From the TPB and EPPM
Theorists have argued that self-efficacy and PBC are concep-
tually similar (Ajzen, 1985, 1991; Ajzen & Madden, 1986).
However, Conner and Armitage (1998) argued that PBC is
really a confounded measure of two constructs: one which is
akin to self-efficacy (cf. Bandura, 1977, 1982; that is, ease
with which the behavior can be adopted) and the other akin
to locus of control (cf. Rotter, 1966; that is, whether a person
believes that the behavior is under volitional control--per-
ceived controllability). In support of this view, several stud-
ies have provided evidence for the conceptual distinction
between perceived controllability and self-efficacy (e.g.,
Armitage & Conner, 1999a, 1999b; Dzewaltowski, Noble, &
Shaw, 1990; Terry & O'Leary, 1995). Terry et al. argued that
they should each be included as separate variables within the
TPB framework. Adding self-efficacy to the TPB has been
shown to increase the explanatory power of the model in
terms of explaining exercise intentions and behavior (e.g.,
Hagger et al., 2002b; Povey, Conner, Sparks, James, &
Shepherd, 2000; Yordy & Lent, 1993). Therefore, it is pre-
dicted that perceptions of self-efficacy and perceived con-
trollability will be conceptually distinct and will each predict
exercise intentions.
It has been argued that components of perceived threat
within the EPPM (i.e., susceptibility and severity) may be
incorporated into the TPB as beliefs contributing to one's
attitudes (Maddux, 1993; Rogers & Prentice-Dunn, 1997).
Susceptibility may be conceptualized as a perceived out-
come of not engaging in the healthy behaviors (i.e., "if I
maintain my sedentary lifestyle I may develop heart
4 SAGE Open
disease"). Perceptions of severity could be conceptualized as
unfavorable evaluations of developing a health problem (i.e.,
"heart disease is a serious and life-threatening"; Maddux,
1993). Beliefs about one's susceptibility to a severe illness
should lead to more negative attitudes concerning the current
unhealthy behavior (cf. Rogers, 1983; Rogers et al., 1997)
and as a result more positive attitudes about proposed
changes in behavior, especially if these are believed to be
effective in alleviating the health risk. Therefore, beliefs
about the efficacy of a particular response in alleviating the
health risk (i.e., response-efficacy) could also be conceptual-
ized as a behavioral belief concerning that response. It can be
safely assumed that this belief would be favorable as it is
unlikely that improving one's health would be viewed as
unfavorable. This suggests that the EPPM constructs of sus-
ceptibility, severity, and response-efficacy may be determi-
nants of attitudes within the TPB. As such, it is predicted that
the effect of these variables on intentions will be mediated by
attitudes.
Ajzen (1991, 2011) argued that a measure of past behav-
ior may be used to test the sufficiency of the TPB. If the TPB
is sufficient, prior behavior (or any other variable) should not
add significant unique variance to the model. However,
meta-analytic reviews of the TPB consistently suggest that
past health behavior is a relatively strong and consistent pre-
dictor of both intentions and behavior even after controlling
for the effects of attitudes, subjective norms, PBC, and inten-
tions (e.g., Conner & Armitage, 1998; Hagger et al., 2002b;
McEachan et al., 2011; Ouellette & Wood, 1998; Sandberg &
Conner, 2008). The addition of past behavior to the TPB also
significantly attenuates the effects of intentions and PBC on
behavior, and the effects of attitudes, subjective norms, and
PBC on intentions (McEachan et al., 2011). Therefore, the
TPB may not be sufficient to predict intentions and behavior,
suggesting that important socio-cognitive predictors may
have been left out of the model.
Ouellette and Wood (1998) argued that when a behavior is
performed frequently within similar contexts, the perfor-
mance of that behavior can become automatic or habitual--
occurring independent of the conscious deliberation posited
by the TPB (cf. Ronis, Yates, & Kirscht, 1989). Therefore, if
an individual has made a habit of exercising in the past, they
are likely to do so in the future.Ajzen (2002) offered an alter-
native explanation arguing that the determinants of past
behavior are likely to affect future behavior and future inten-
tions. As such, assuming these determinants do not change
significantly over time, past behavior will necessarily corre-
late with intentions. Ajzen suggested that the link between
past behavior and intentions is spurious and should be medi-
ated by other predictors of intentions. It is possible that this
effect may be due to past exercise raising individual's self-
efficacy with respect to exercising in the future. Engaging in
exercise demonstrates empirically that one should be able to
exercise again (cf. Bandura, 1977, 1982). Therefore, it is pre-
dicted that self-efficacy will mediate the effect of past exer-
cise behavior on intentions to exercise.
Taken together, we propose a model in which exercise
will be determined by attitudes, subjective norms, self-effi-
cacy, and perceived controllability. Severity, susceptibility,
and response-efficacy will have no direct effect on intentions
but will exert their influence via attitudes. Past behavior will
be used to test the sufficiency of the model and its effect on
intentions should be mediated by self-efficacy.
Method
The results reported here are preliminary findings from a
larger study investigating the predictors of health behavior
change around obesity, diet, and exercise. The present
research will report only the results pertaining to the predic-
tors of exercise.
Participants
A total of 336 participants (265 females, 71 males) were
recruited for the study. The mean age of participants was
25.28 years (SD = 11.01). Most participants were recruited
from the undergraduate psychology program of a university
in New South Wales, Australia, via an online advertisement
(N = 284), the remaining 52 participants were recruited from
the general public via advertisement posters. Undergraduate
participants received partial course credit for their participa-
tion, whereas the general public participants received no
incentives or rewards.
Measures
With the exception of the demographics measure, all mea-
sures used in this study have been adapted from those used
in previous research testing the TPB (e.g., Chatzisarantis et
al., 2009; Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010; Jones et al., 2004; Payne,
Jones, & Harris, 2004; Rivis & Sheeran, 2003) and the
EPPM (e.g., Cho, 2003; Witte, 1994; Witte, Cameron,
McKeon, & Berkowitz, 1996). The phrasing of the items
remained similar but was adapted to fit the health context of
this study.
All items corresponded to exactly the same specific
behavior ("exercising 30 min a day, 5 days per week") over a
specific time frame ("the next month") following recommen-
dations from Ajzen (1991). With the exception of the demo-
graphics measure (which was presented first) and the
attitudes and intentions measures (which were presented
last), the items from the remaining scales were presented in
random order. All measures except the attitudes measure uti-
lized a 7-point categorical scale anchored by strongly agree
and strongly disagree. The attitudes measure utilized a
7-point semantic differential scale. Items pertaining to each
of the measures were summed, then averaged by dividing the
total by the number of items, such that each measure was
scored out of seven. The experiment was performed online
on the university server. The survey program was used to
randomize the items.

Demographics/past behavior.Age, sex, and information per-
taining to relevant health behaviors (e.g., frequency of exer-
cise, minutes spent exercising per week) were gathered using
a demographics measure. Past exercise behavior was deter-
mined by asking participants how many exercise sessions
they had completed over the past month and what was the
average length of these exercise sessions. These values were
used to calculate the time (in hours) spent exercising per
week. This was used as a measure of past behavior. As a
guide, participants were provided with the following defini-
tion of exercise: "Exercise is defined as physical activity that
is planned, structured, and repetitive for the purpose of con-
ditioning any part of the body or increasing physical
fitness."
Attitudes. Participant's attitudes were measured using a four-
item semantic differential scale. Participants indicated the
extent to which engaging in exercise during the next month
would be good/bad, enjoyable/not enjoyable, unwise/wise,
and beneficial/not beneficial. The internal consistency for
this measure was high ( = .84).
Subjective norms.Subjective norms were measured using a
two-item scale. Participants indicated the extent to which
they believe that important others would "approve" or "rec-
ommend" that they engage in exercise during the next month.
The internal consistency for this measure was acceptable
( = .77).
Perceived controllability.Perceived controllability was mea-
sured using a two-item scale. Participants indicated the
extent to which they believe that they have control over
engaging in exercise during the next month (i.e., "It is mostly
up to me [I have control over] whether or not I exercise for at
least 30 min per day during the next month"). The internal
consistency for this measure was high ( = .89).
Susceptibility. Susceptibility was measured using a three-item
scale. Participants indicated whether they believed them-
selves to be "at risk of," "likely to develop," or "possibly
affected by" the adverse health effects associated with weight
gain. The internal consistency of this scale was high
( = .96).
Severity.Severity was measured using a three-item scale.
Participants indicated the extent to which they believed that
the adverse health effects associated with weight gain are
"severe," "serious," and "significant." The internal consis-
tency of this scale was acceptable ( = .78).
Self-efficacy.Self-efficacy was measured using a six-item
scale. Items included the following: "Exercising for 30 min-
utes per day 5 days per week during the next month will be
easy (difficult, inconvenient [reverse scored]) for me" and "I
am able to (I am certain I could, If I wanted to I could easily)
exercise for 30 min . . ." The internal consistency for the
scale was high ( = .93).
Response-efficacy.Response-efficacy was measured using a
three-item scale. Participants indicated the extent to which
they believe that engaging in exercise "works" and "is effec-
tive" in preventing weight-related health problems. The
internal consistency for this measure was high ( = .89).
Intentions. The dependent variable, intentions, was measured
using a two-item scale. Items included the following: "I
intend to exercise for at least 30 min per day, 5 days per week
during the next month" and "I will exercise . . ." The internal
consistency for this measure was high ( = .88).
Data Analysis
Principal components analysis was utilized to ascertain
whether self-efficacy and perceived controllability were dis-
tinct constructs. Pearson's correlations were utilized to
investigate the intercorrelations between the psychological
variables used in this study. Multiple regression was utilized
to investigate the predictors of attitudes. Hierarchical regres-
sion analysis was utilized to uncover a significant model of
factors that predict exercise intentions. This analysis was
performed by entering four different blocks of predictors into
a regression equation predicting intentions. Block 1 con-
sisted of the TPB variables (i.e., attitudes, subjective norms,
and perceived controllability). Block 2 contained self-effi-
cacy. Block 3 consisted of the remaining variables from the
EPPM (i.e., susceptibility, severity, and response-efficacy).
Block 4 contained past exercise behavior. Hierarchical
regression was also utilized to investigate whether the effect
of severity, susceptibility, and response-efficacy on inten-
tions is mediated by attitudes, and whether the effect of past
behavior on intentions is mediated by self-efficacy.
Results
Principal Components Analysis
As PBC and self-efficacy are conceptually similar, there was
a need to ensure that the items used were indeed representing
two separate constructs, rather than one overarching con-
struct. Therefore, a principal components analysis with
Varimax rotation was performed on the perceived controlla-
bility and self-efficacy items. Kaiser's criterion (eigenvalue
> 1) was utilized to determine how many factors to extract.
The first factor (rotated: eigenvalue = 4.00, variance
explained = 49.95%; unrotated: eigenvalue = 5.13, variance
explained = 64.17%) was found to all six of the self-efficacy
items loading on it (with factor loadings greater than .5;
Kline, 1994). The second factor (rotated: eigenvalue = 2.23,
additional variance explained = 27.87%; unrotated: eigen-
value = 1.09, additional variance explained = 13.65%) had
6 SAGE Open
both of the perceived controllability items loading on it. No
further factors were extracted (eigenvalues < 1). As pre-
dicted, these results indicate that the self-efficacy and per-
ceived controllability items represent distinct constructs.
However, the percentage of additional variance explained by
the second factor was small, indicating that this factor is rela-
tively weak. Nevertheless both factors were retained to
investigate the unique effect of self-efficacy and perceived
controllability on intentions. The total variance explained by
the two-factor rotated solution was 78.21%. The correlation
between the resultant measures of perceived controllability
and self-efficacy was r = .51.
Descriptive Statistics and Correlations
Descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients for each of
the psychological variables are presented in Table 1.
Pearson's correlations coefficients revealed a strong positive
association between self-efficacy and intentions; moderate
positive associations were observed between exercise inten-
tions and attitudes, subjective norms, perceived controllabil-
ity, and past behavior. Exercise intentions were also weakly
associated with response-efficacy. Contrary to predictions,
no significant bivariate correlation was found between exer-
cise intentions and susceptibility or severity. As predicted,
attitudes were positively associated with response-efficacy,
and past behavior was positively associated with self-
efficacy. However, contrary to predictions, neither severity
nor susceptibility was associated with attitudes. Furthermore, a
moderate positive correlation was found between self-efficacy
and perceived controllability. Other intercorrelations were
generally weak or non-significant. However, moderate posi-
tive associations were recorded between attitudes and sub-
jective norms, attitudes and self-efficacy, subjective norms
and self-efficacy, subjective norms and response-efficacy,
and perceived controllability and response-efficacy.
Prediction of Attitudes
Multiple regression analysis was utilized to investigate the
effect of susceptibility, severity, and response-efficacy on
attitudes. A significant model which explained 7.29% of the
variance in attitudes was found, F(3, 332) = 9.77, p< .001
(see Table 2). Response-efficacy was the only variable found
to explain a significant proportion of the variance in atti-
tudes. Contrary to predictions, the effects of both susceptibil-
ity and severity were non-significant.
Predictors of Exercise Intentions
The first step in the hierarchical regression analysis revealed
that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived controllability
each contributed to the prediction of exercise intentions,
F(3, 332) = 44.60, p< .001 (see Table 2). Self-efficacy was
found to explain a further 16.21% of the variance,F(1, 331)
= 97.60, p< .001. Following the addition of self-efficacy to
the model, the effect of both subjective norms and perceived
controllability was attenuated to non-significance. The
remaining EPPM predictors explained a further 1.90% of the
variance in intentions, F(3, 328) = 4.89, p< .005. However,
perceived susceptibility was the only variable to explain a
significant proportion of the remaining variance. Finally,
past exercise behavior was also found to be a significant pre-
dictor of intentions, explaining a small proportion of the
remaining variance, F(1, 327) = 8.95, p< .005. The overall
model explained 47.46% of the variance in exercise
intentions.
Given the zero-order bivariate relationship between sus-
ceptibility and intentions (r = .02, p = .78), it is possible that
susceptibility acted as a suppressor variable. Suppressor
variables generally increase the prediction of an outcome
variable of interest by increasing the predictive validity of
one or more predictor variables (cf. MacKinnon, Krull, &
Lockwood, 2000; Pandey & Elliot, 2010; Tzelgov & Henik,
1991). This occurs as the suppressor variable suppresses
variance in one or more of the predictor variables, which is
irrelevant to the outcome variable. Investigation of the cor-
relation matrix revealed that susceptibility was negatively
associated with self-efficacy (r = -.19, p< .001). Furthermore,
a small increase in the beta-weight for self-efficacy was
found following the inclusion of susceptibility in the model.
MacKinnon et al. demonstrated that suppression and

mediation are mathematically equivalent. As such, tests of
mediation, such as the Sobel test, can also be applied to iden-
tifying suppressor effects (Preacher & Hayes, 2004). A Sobel
test revealed that the inclusion of susceptibility in a model
regressing intentions from self-efficacy significantly
increased the predictive validity of self-efficacy (Z = -2.44,
p< .05). This indicates that susceptibility acted as a suppres-
sor variable within the regression equation, suppressing vari-
ance in self-efficacy, which was irrelevant to intentions
(classical suppression; Horst, 1941; Pandey &Elliot, 2010;
Tzelgov & Henik, 1991). These findings suggest that exer-
cise intentions are not associated with the shared variance
between self-efficacy and susceptibility.
Mediation Analyses
It was predicted that attitudes would mediate the relationship
between response-efficacy and intentions, susceptibility and
intentions, and severity and intentions. Following Baron and
Kenny (1986), variables were only entered as potential medi-
ators when (a) the predictor was correlated with the mediator
(attitudes), (b) the predictor was correlated with the
dependent variable (intentions), and (c) the mediator was
correlated with the dependent variable. Investigations of cor-
relation matrix revealed that attitudes qualified as a mediator
for the effect of response-efficacy on intentions. Both sus-
ceptibility and severity did not correlate with intentions. This
suggests that neither susceptibility nor severity exert any
direct or indirect effect on intentions.
Attitudes were found to fully mediate the effect of
response-efficacy on intentions to lose weight. Response-
efficacy was found to be a predictor of intentions in the first
step of a hierarchical linear regression analysis ( = .15, p<
.01). However, following the addition of attitudes into the
equation, the effect of response-efficacy was attenuated to
non-significance ( = .07, p = .20). A Sobel test of mediation
revealed that the indirect effect of response-efficacy on
intentions was significant (Z = 3.68, p< .001; cf. Preacher &
Hayes, 2004). These findings support the prediction that atti-
tudes will mediate the effect of response-efficacy on
intentions.
A similar analysis was performed to investigate whether
self-efficacy mediated the relationship between past exercise
behavior and intentions. Investigation of the correlation
matrix revealed that self-efficacy qualified as a mediator.
Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that adding self-
efficacy to a model regressing exercise intentions from past
exercise behavior attenuated the effect of past exercise
behavior to non-significance-- reduced from .26 (p< .001)
to .02 (p = .63), Z = 6.62, p< .001. These findings support the
prediction that the effect of past behavior on intentions will
be mediated by self-efficacy.
Discussion
The current study aimed to investigate whether there is util-
ity in combining constructs from the TPB and EPPM to pre-
dict exercise intentions. Results suggested that although the
TPB is a useful model for predicting exercise intentions, the
addition of variables from the EPPM increased its explana-
tory power. The identified integrated model suggested that
individuals are most likely to intend to exercise when they
believe that engaging in exercise will lead to desirable out-
comes, believe that others will approve of their exercising,
believe that they are able to exercise effectively, and believe
that they are susceptible to weight-related illnesses. The
identified model closely resembles the structure of the TPB,
the only differences being that only the self-efficacy compo-
nent of PBC was an important predictor and perceived sus-
ceptibility explained additional variance. The proportion of
the variance explained by the model is comparable with that
found in meta-analytic reviews of TPB research relating to
health behaviors (e.g., Godin & Kok, 1996; Hagger et al.,
2002; McEachan et al., 2011). The addition of susceptibility
and past behavior only added a further 3%, suggesting that
these variables are far less important predictors of exercise
intentions than attitudes and self-efficacy.

Self-Efficacy and Perceived Controllability
The results of this study lend further support for the separa-
tion of the PBC construct into two component parts: self-
efficacy and perceived controllability. These findings are
consistent with a large number of studies, which have pro-
vided evidence for the conceptual distinction between self-
efficacy and perceived controllability (e.g., Armitage &
Conner, 1999a, 1999b; Hagger & Chatzisarantis, 2005;
Povey et al., 2000; Terry & O'Leary, 1995; White, Terry, &
Hogg, 1994). Although there is evidence to suggest that both
self-efficacy and PBC may contribute unique variance to
models of health behavior intentions (e.g., Hagger et al.,
2002; Yordy & Lent, 1993), this finding was not borne out in
the current study. In the present study, the effect of perceived
controllability on intentions was attenuated to non-signifi-
cance following the addition of self-efficacy to the model.
However, these results echo other previous findings which
suggest that self-efficacy is a stronger predictor of intentions
than perceived controllability (e.g., Povey et al., 2000;
Sparks, Guthrie, & Shepherd, 1997; Terry & O'Leary, 1995).
These findings suggest that individual's belief that they are
capable of engaging in exercise is a more important predictor
of exercise intentions than their belief that they have control
over whether they engage in exercise.
Attitudes
Attitudes were found to be a predictor of intentions lending
support to the predictions of the TPB. Attitudes are consis-
tently a strong predictor of intentions in TPB research (cf.
Godin & Kok, 1996; Hagger et al., 2002; McEachan et al.,
2011). As predicted, response-efficacy was found to be a sig-
nificant predictor of attitudes. However, contrary to predic-
tions susceptibility and severity were non-significant
predictors. These results support previous findings in the lit-
erature, suggesting that perceptions of efficacy (but not
threat) are associated with more positive attitudes concern-
ing health behaviors (e.g., Ruiter, Verplanken, Kok, & Werrij,
2003; Witte, 1992b, 1994). Attitudes were also found to fully
mediate the effect of response-efficacy on intentions.
According to the EPPM, individual's perceptions of
response-efficacy can be manipulated through health mes-
sages highlighting the effectiveness of certain responses
(e.g., Cho, 2003; Witte, 1992b, 1994; Witte & Allen, 2000).
Therefore, a health message may increase perceptions of
response-efficacy with respect to a recommended response,
which determines one's attitudes concerning that response,
which in turn determines intentions and behavior. This medi-
ation model is consistent with the results of this study and the
predictions of both the TPB and EPPM. As such, it may be
possible to apply the TPB to the prediction of health message
responsiveness. Investigating this possibility would be an
interesting venture for future research.
Other predictors of exercise intentions included subjec-
tive norms, susceptibility, and past behavior. Importantly,
these variables were much weaker predictors of intentions.
Several researchers have noted that subjective norms are
often a weaker predictor of intention than either attitudes or
PBC as evidenced by effect sizes in meta-analytic reviews
and regression weights (e.g., Ajzen, 1991; Armitage &
Conner, 2001; Conner & Armitage, 1998; Hagger et al.,
2002; Hausenblas et al., 1997; McEachan et al., 2011; Rivis
& Sheeran, 2003). Findings also suggest that perceptions of
threat are weaker predictors of exercise intentions than effi-
cacy perceptions (e.g., Lippke & Plotnikoff, 2009; Plotnikoff
& Higginbotham, 1995; Plotnikoff & Trinh, 2010; Plotnikoff,
Rhodes, & Trinh, 2009; Plotnikoff, Trinh, et al., 2009).
Furthermore, susceptibility was identified as a suppressor
variable increasing the predictive validity of self-efficacy.
This suggests that the positive effect of self-efficacy on
intentions is not at all attributable to the finding that those
with high self-efficacy tend to report lower susceptibility. The
effect of susceptibility was significant because it removed
variance in self-efficacy which was unrelated to exercise
intentions; rather than susceptibility exerting any direct
impact on intentions.
Past exercise behavior was also found to be a predictor
of exercise intentions. However, it only added a very small
amount of the residual variance in intentions after control-
ling for the effect of the other psychological variables.
Nevertheless, this suggests that the current model may be
inadequate and other psychosocial constructs may need to
be considered to optimize the prediction of exercise inten-
tions (cf. Ajzen, 1991, 2011). However, the results of this
study suggest that the effect of past exercise behavior on
intentions is mediated by self-efficacy. This finding sup-
ports Ajzen's (2002) contention that the effect of past
behavior on future intentions is spurious and should be
mediated by other predictors of intentions. The results of
the present study suggest that engaging in exercise in the
past increases one's belief that they could continue to exer-
cise in the future, which in turn predicts intentions to
exercise.
It is important to note that variables from both the TPB
and EPPM contributed to the model. Furthermore, several of
the psychological variables from both models either did not
predict exercise intentions (susceptibility and severity) or did
not contribute unique variance to its prediction (perceived
controllability, response-efficacy). This suggests that neither
model provides a complete or optimal account of exercise
intentions. Despite a large number of variables being used as
predictors, a relatively simple five-factor model of intentions
emerged. This suggests that theoretical integration can be
used to identify variables that are weakly or spuriously asso-
ciated with an outcome variable of interest (cf. Hagger, 2009,
2010). The results of this study further suggest that theoreti-
cal integration can be utilized to develop our understanding
of the relations between constructs from separate models.
With the large number of extant models being applied to
health behavior, many of which making very similar or iden-
tical predictions, it is important to identify and understand
Richards and Johnson 9
connections between these models. This allows for identifi-
cation of general cross-theoretical principles of predicting
health behavior (Maddux, 1993; Noar & Zimmerman, 2005).
This is desirable as it serves to simplify and reconcile the
health behavior literature as a whole (cf. Hagger, 2009;
Maddux, 1993). Reconciliation of the health behavior litera-
ture may be achieved through further research, which
employs theoretical integration (cf. Hagger, 2009, 2010).
A limitation of the present research is the use of intentions
as the primary outcome measure in lieu of a specific measure
of behavior. Although many socio-cognitive models (includ-
ing TPB and EPPM) assume that intentions are the proximal
predictor of behavior, this assumption has often been called
into question (e.g., Rhodes & Dickau, 2012; Rhodes,
Plotnikoff, & Courneya, 2008; Sheeran, 2002). In a review
of the relevant literature, Sheeran found that intentions
explained, on average, only 28% of the variance in behavior.
This suggests that individuals self-reported intentions do not
necessarily translate into behavior. Future research could
employ a longitudinal design to ascertain the extent to which
intention predicts subsequent behavior within an integrated
model.
Conclusion
The present study suggests that exercise intentions can be
predicted by attitudes, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and
past behavior. Several other psychological variables that
have been shown to be robust predictors of behavioral inten-
tions in previous research were investigated but did not con-
tribute unique variance to the model. Furthermore, an
interesting relationship between response-efficacy and atti-
tudes was uncovered, which suggests that the TPB may be
applied to the prediction of responses to health messages.
Taken together, these findings suggest that theoretical inte-
gration can highlight variables that are weakly or spuriously
associated with health behavior intentions. Furthermore, it
can develop our understanding of how constructs from dif-
ferent theoretical models can be combined to predict inten-
tions. The authors advocate using theoretical integration as a
methodology to improve understanding of the determinants
of health behavior.
