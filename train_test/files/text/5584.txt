Introduction
In recent decades, the proportion of deaths associated with
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has been increasing.1
The rising trend of lifestyle-related diseases presents a major
global public health challenge, and is fast becoming a burden
on population health, draining resources from healthcare sys-
tems worldwide.2­5 Various modifiable risk factors for NCDs
have been identified, including hypertension, hypercholester-
olaemia, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, tobacco use and inade-
quate intake of fruit and vegetables.6 Many of these modifiable
risk factors are closely related to dietary patterns and physical
activity, and are important in chronic disease prevention.7
Various national and international guidelines have recom-
mended at least 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic
physical activity per week, or 75 min of vigorous-intensity
aerobic activity, or equivalent alternatives, for healthy
adults.8­11 In addition, as fruits and vegetables are naturally
low in energy content while rich in dietary fibre, vitamins and
minerals, at least two servings of fruits and two servings of

Abstract
Introduction: Many modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases are related to dietary patterns and physical activity. This
study aims to establish the prevalence of adequate fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity among community-ambulant
patients in Singapore.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among community-ambulant patients using convenience sampling. Data
were collected through a survey questionnaire, covering self-reported level of physical activity and daily fruit and vegetable
intake. Demographic information, awareness and adherence to recommendations were summarised using descriptive
statistics. To identify factors influencing awareness and behaviour, exploratory logistic regression analyses were performed.
Results: Three hundred and eighty-five complete responses were analysed. For intake of fruits and vegetables, 29.1% and
21.3% of participants were aware of and adherent to the fruit and vegetable intake recommendation respectively. For physical
activity, 21.3% and 26.8% of study participants were aware of and adherent to the recommendation respectively. Only 4.7%
and 5.5% of participants were aware of and practising both recommendations respectively. Gender, age, ethnicity and body
mass index were found to have significant influence on the awareness of the recommendations. However, there was no
significant factor found to be contributing to the adherence to the recommendations.
Conclusion: Awareness of and adherence to lifestyle recommendations among patients remain low despite ongoing
publicity efforts. Many are not fully aware of and adherent to the dietary and physical activity recommendations publicised.
Apart from intensifying public outreach on every possible occasion and delivering messages in manners understandable by our
older patients, strategies targeting the knowledge­behaviour disconnect among working middle-aged patients also deserve
continued attention in the near future.

vegetables are recommended daily. Meeting these recom-
mendations has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovas-
cular diseases, type-2 diabetes, cancers and premature
mortality.12,13
Despite well-known benefits of an active lifestyle, and
adequate fruit and vegetable intake, health authorities globally
have been experiencing difficulty in encouraging their respec-
tive populations to adopt the recommendations. In a study
conducted by the United States Centre for Disease Control
and Prevention, less than 20% of men and 15% of women
engaged in these two lifestyle strategies.14 In Brazil, more than
half of the adult population was found to be overweight, and
failed to practise any kind of physical activity during leisure
time, or consume fruits and vegetables regularly.15,16 Similarly
in Singapore, the 2010 National Health Survey revealed that
only one in five adults engaged in regular exercise during their
leisure time. Even with inclusion of physical activity at work,
and walking or cycling while travelling to and from places in
addition to leisure-time physical activity, only six in 10 adults
had sufficient total physical activity.17,18
In an effort to improve adherence to recommendations
and combat chronic diseases, a wide range of research and
interventions have been trialled, with limited success.19­21 In
Singapore, for instance, the Ministry of Health has recently
declared war on diabetes and rolled out a series of long term
campaigns, such as the `Eat, Drink, Shop Healthy' Challenge
and National Steps Challenge, to encourage active lifestyle
and healthy eating habits, including adequate fruit and vegeta-
ble intake.22,23 While such publicity strategies through mass
education campaigns, news coverage and advertisements
have also been implemented in various settings, it is not
known how much impact these efforts have on actual behav-
ioural changes, especially among patients with existing medi-
cal conditions and chronic diseases.24­26 As such, our
cross-sectional study aims to establish current prevalence of
adequate fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity
among community-ambulant patients in Singapore. A second-
ary exploratory objective is to investigate the associations
with socio-demographic and contribution of different factors
towards awareness of and adherence to recommendations
for physical activity and intake of fruits and vegetables. This
will help to guide the future development of health promo-
tion strategies that aim to reduce the burden of obesity and
chronic diseases.
Methods
Study design and data collection
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a 330-bed acute
care hospital in Singapore, from September 2016 to
December 2016. Participants were selected by convenience
sampling among patients filling prescriptions at the outpatient
pharmacy. Inclusion criteria for participant selection were: (1)
community-ambulant adult patients between the age of 21
and 80 years who are not confined to bed or institutionalised
as a result of disease or surgery; (2) without prescribed
restriction of diet and exercise; (3) able to communicate in
English or Mandarin. Participants were excluded if they with-
drew their participation at any point of the data collection or
were unable or unwilling to give verbal consent for participa-
tion. The study protocol was vetted by Singhealth Centralised
Institutional Review Board (ref.: 2016/2837).
The three-page survey questionnaire was administered by a
single study investigator, who would clarify queries and rein-
force definitions to the respondents during data collection. The
questionnaire (Appendix 1) was divided into three section:
demographic information, dietary habits and exercise regime.
Both open-ended and closed-ended questions were used to
elicit information from the participants. Separate illustrative
charts for exercise types and portion sizes for food (Appendix
2) were also used during data collection to help participants
estimate their level of physical activity and daily fruit and vege-
table intake. While there may be varying interpretations and
aspects of `adequacy' in fruit and vegetable intake and physical
activity in different countries or healthcare settings, we define
the standards for the purpose of this study as adherence to
Singapore's Health Promotion Board (HPB) recommendations:
(1) two servings of fruits and two servings of vegetables daily,
and (2) at least 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical
activity per week, or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic activ-
ity, or equivalent alternatives. These recommendations have
been consistently conveyed over the years while other guide-
lines such as the food pyramid and macro-nutrient consump-
tions have undergone considerable revisions.
Sample size calculation and statistical
analyses
Based on an infinite population, with 5% margin of error and
95% confidence level, 385 survey responses were needed.27,28
Demographic information, awareness and adherence to life-
style recommendations were summarised using descriptive
statistics. Predictive ability of awareness towards actual adher-
ence to recommendations was determined using one-way
analysis of variance. To identify factors influencing awareness
and behaviour, logistic regression analyses were performed
with the following patient demographics: gender, age, ethnic-
ity, education level, body mass index (BMI), history of long
term medication use, tobacco use and alcohol consumption.
All the analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Version 17.0
(Chicago: SPSS Inc.).
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure of this study was the preva-
lence of adequate fruit and vegetable intake and adequate
physical activity among community-ambulant patients in
Singapore. The secondary exploratory outcome measure
was significance of selected demographic factors affecting
awareness and adherence to at least one of the dietary and
lifestyle recommendations of interest.
Results
In total, 389 patients were approached at the hospital's outpa-
tient pharmacy for survey participation while they were waiting
for their prescriptions to be filled. Three hundred and eighty-
five patients completed the survey questionnaire. Figure 1
details the participant enrolment process for the study.
Goh et al. 3
Characteristics of the participants
Of the 385 patients who completed the survey, 197 (51.2 %)
were male, with most of them above 40 years of age (68.3%)
and of Chinese ethnicity (54.0%). The majority of the partici-
pants had at least secondary education (76.9%). The mean BMI
of the participants was 22.81 kg/m2. Other demographic char-
acteristics of the study participants are summarised in Table 1.
Awareness of and adherence to
recommendations
For intake of fruits and vegetables, 29.1% of participants were
aware of the recommendation on daily intake of two servings
of fruits and two servings of vegetables. However, they con-
sumed only 1.04 servings of fruits and 1.78 servings of vege-
tables daily on average, with 78.7% of participants failing to
consume the recommended two servings of fruits and two
servings of vegetables on any typical day. Common reasons
given for non-adherence were personal dislike of fruits
(49.6%) and vegetables (49.2%) and lack of time to prepare
or purchase (42.3%).
For physical activity, 21.3% of study participants were
aware of the recommendations by HPB. The mean time
spent on moderate-intensity physical activity was 90 min per
week and 73.2% of participants reported that they did not
engage in at least 150 min of moderate-intensity physical
activity on any typical week. Common reasons given for physi-
cal inactivity were perceived poor health (40.4%) and laziness
or tiredness (38.3%).
Out of the 385 participants surveyed, only 18 (4.7%) par-
ticipants were aware of both recommendations and 21
(5.5%) patients reported to have met both recommenda-
tions. About one in four participants were aware of and were
able to meet either recommendation respectively. One hun-
dred and fifty-four (40.0%) participants were reportedly
unable to meet the recommendations as they were not aware
of them in the first place. On the other hand, 73 (19.0%)
participants failed to meet the recommendations despite
being aware of them. Surprisingly, there were 97 (25.2%) par-
ticipants who met the recommendations despite not being
aware of them. That was reportedly due to their general
awareness of health benefits for dietary fibre intake and exer-
cise while not knowing the specific recommended amounts.
These findings are tabulated in Table 2.
Awareness in dietary recommendation was not predictive
of adherence (p=0.389, 95% confidence interval (CI): ­0.294
to 0.755); similarly, awareness in physical activity recommen-
dation was also not predictive of corresponding behaviour
(p=0.765, 95% CI: ­0.462 to 0.628).
Factors affecting awareness and adherence
Two logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the
influence of pre-defined demographic factors that may be asso-
ciated with levels of awareness and adherence to at least one of
the dietary and lifestyle recommendations of interest. Gender,
age group, ethnicity and BMI were found to have significant influ-
ence on the awareness of the recommendations. Collectively,
these four factors alone explained 20.2% of the variation.
On the other hand, there was no significant factor found
to be contributing to the adherence to the recommenda-
tions. These findings are summarised in Tables 3 and 4
respectively.
Discussion
Considerable evidence has accumulated in recent decades
regarding the importance of adequate physical activity and
intake of fruits and vegetables in the management of
chronic diseases.29­31 A review of literature revealed that

exercise confers significant therapeutic benefits in meta-
bolic syndrome-related disorders, heart and pulmonary
diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, a number of cancers and
mental illnesses.32 Guidelines and public health strategies
have also accorded increasing attention to these non-phar-
macologic interventions to chronic disease prevention and
management.22­26
In our study, however, significant proportions of patient
participants were found to be unaware of and not adhering to
the specified dietary and lifestyle recommendations of inter-
est despite intensive publicity by the health authorities over
the years.33­36 Also, being aware of the recommendations did
not translate into corresponding adherence to them, present-
ing a potential knowledge­behaviour disconnect. Although
similar findings have been reported and reasons were
explored in similar studies from other countries, the observa-
tion from our study may be further explained by several addi-
tional reasons befitting the cultural context in Singapore.14­16
First, 49.6% and 49.2% of our study participants report-
edly `disliked fruits' and `disliked vegetables' respectively.
These personal preferences and perceptions could be a result
of lifestyle habits adopted since their youth due to potential
economic reasons or low recognition of the associated health
benefits by the parents then.37 At the national level, there
may be a need to study and review the state of nutrition edu-
cation and awareness, identify gaps and determine whether
ongoing nutrition messages are indeed achieving their
intended objectives among the average Singaporeans.
Second, 42.3% of our study participants claimed that they
did not have time to prepare healthier food at home. Hectic
work commitment and related stress may be contributors to
this phenomenon.38 It was also noted that as the proportion
of dual-income families increases due to rising costs of living,
the practice of eating out has become increasingly common in
Singapore.39,40 However, food items sold in most eateries in
Singapore are not usually served with fruits, these having to be
purchased separately. In addition, the vegetable component in
local food choices is also often small in portion size. Collectively,
these may help to explain the external factors surrounding the
lack of fruit and vegetable intake among our participants.
Third, there seemed to be considerable inertia among our
patients with self-reported `poor health' to get physically active.
Among 188 (48.8%) patients who provided reasons for their
physical inactivity 76 (40.4%) cited poor health. Nonetheless, it
was unclear whether those who cited poor health as the
reason were indeed unsuitable for the recommended level of

physical activity or actually facing difficulty of concurrently man-
aging their chronic diseases alongside competing commitments.
Similar to our Taiwanese counterparts, middle-aged Singapore
residents exercise least regularly.18,41 Health promotion strate-
gies targeting middle-aged patients who continue to work may
warrant more attention in the future.
Finally, although it was only 26.8% of the participants
whose reported physical activity met the recommendations,
a previous study conducted in Singapore established that as
much as 73.8% of the population could meet the physical
activity guidelines if travel-related activities were included in
the computation.18 This is important for Singapore as the
majority of the population travel by foot or public transport
owing to low private car ownership.42 Singapore has also
done well in the creation of self-sufficient satellite towns
where each housing estate is fully equipped with essential
amenities within walking distance, effectively encouraging
residents to walk when running errands within their housing
estates. However, it is worth noting that travel-related activi-
ties may be of lower intensity and it has been suggested that
their health effects might be less significant than those of pur-
poseful exercise.43,44 As well, regular exercise may confer
additional benefits beyond general health, such as physical fit-
ness, dexterity, strength or even quality of life.43,45­47 The
finding that despite engaging in less physical exercise many
Singaporeans are still able to achieve relatively high levels of
total daily physical activity, if travel-related activities are
included, has lessons to be learnt for the selection and imple-
mentation of appropriate health promotion strategies at the
national level. Studying the patterns of travel-related activity
against different socio-demographic characteristics may shed
light on unmet needs in supportive infrastructure. Other
strategies, such as promoting work­life balance and work-
place physical activities, heightening awareness of exercise
and recreational facilities and encouraging supportive work-
place cultures, may need to be considered.
From the exploratory logistic regression models, it was
found that gender, age, ethnicity and BMI were significant fac-
tors that may affect the awareness of lifestyle recommenda-
tions, but only managed to collectively explain 20.2% of the
variation in the rate of awareness. Moreover, none of the fac-
tors included in the regression model for adherence behav-
iour turned out to be significant. It echoed the findings of
many previous studies that issues relating to lifestyle and
behaviour are often multifaceted, involving the interplay of
many known and unknown variables.14­18 As such, it is unlikely
that the problems of low awareness of and low adherence to
healthy lifestyle practices may be addressed by a few simple
or targeted solutions. Nonetheless, the least that healthcare
professionals and health campaigners may do is to seize every
possible opportunity to remind and motivate patients to take
greater initiative in adopting a healthier lifestyle and greater
ownership in maintaining their health in the community. This
may just help to persuade some patients contemplating it to
actually begin their journey of behavioural change.48
To our knowledge, this is the first local study to evaluate
awareness of and adherence to lifestyle recommendations
among community-ambulant patients and the results of this
study could provide healthcare professionals and government
organisations with insights to improve future health promotion
initiatives in Singapore. The survey was intentionally designed to
be short and simple, covering only pertinent questions to
answer our study investigations. This led to an impressive
response rate of 99%, thereby reducing the risk of selection
bias. Moreover, all the questionnaires were administered by a
single investigator with the use of illustrative charts and dia-
grams. These helped to improve consistency in survey responses
and minimise potential information bias during data collection.
There were some limitations in this study. Given that this
was a cross-sectional study, it may not be appropriate to
extrapolate the findings to other time points. Data collection
was done under the assumption that there was minimal
reporting bias, and that any ongoing health campaigns, such as
the War on Diabetes and National Steps Challenge, had mini-
mal influence on the responses during the recall period.22,23 It
was a deliberate decision to include only community ambulant
patients in this study because the study team believed that this
group of patients has good potential to be engaged and influ-
enced through measures and intervention to encourage adop-
tion of healthier lifestyles. However, the study team was not
able to sample patients from the community who have their
conditions managed solely by general practitioners. This limits
the generalisability of the study findings to other patient
groups who may have milder diseases not requiring specialist
care. In addition, the definition over what may constitute

`healthy lifestyle' is not unified across different countries, cul-
tures and care settings. For this study, we based our awareness
of and adherence to `healthy lifestyle' solely on Singapore's
HPB's recommendations. Therein lies a potential bias as
patients who are aware and adherent to recommendations
other than HPB's would be classified as unaware of or non-
adherenttoourstudy-specificrecommendations.Nonetheless,
we settled on HPB's ongoing recommendations as the team
felt that they were probably the most applicable in our local
context. As most data were self-reported by the respondents,
there could be recall bias. To mitigate this risk, we used illustra-
tive charts to help the respondents during the recall process,
and worded the questions neutrally without informing the
respondents of what were the actual target recommenda-
tions. Finally, we did not attempt to collect personal data that
may contain possible confounders, such as personal income
data, occupation and exposure to social media, for our logistic
regression models. As a result, the possibility of residual con-
founding from unmeasured demographic factors could not be
ruled out and this could have influenced the results.
In conclusion, our study findings suggest that awareness of
and adherence to lifestyle recommendations among patients
remain low despite years of publicity effort. Many commu-
nity-ambulant patients in Singapore are not fully aware of and
adherent to the dietary and physical activity recommenda-
tions that were publicised. Apart from intensifying public out-
reach at every possible occasion and delivering messages in
manners understandable by our older patients, strategies
targeting the knowledge­behaviour disconnect among work-
ing middle-aged patients who are aware of the recommenda-
tions but choose not to act on them also deserve continued
attention in the near future.
