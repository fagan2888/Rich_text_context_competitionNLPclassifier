Abstract
Objective: To investigate the role of ovarian cystectomy in patients with early-stage immature
teratoma.
Methods: A retrospective review was undertaken on patients diagnosed pathologically with
immature teratoma and with malignant lesions confined to the ovary. Patients were included if they
had been treated between January 1997 and December 2015 at the Obstetrics and Gynaecology
Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Relevant demographic and clinical data were
retrieved from the medical records.
Results: Forty-three patients were included in the study; 14 underwent ovarian cystectomy
(group 1) and 29 underwent unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (USO; group 2). Three of the
patients who underwent USO relapsed and required a second surgical intervention. The 5-year
disease-free survival rates were 100% and 88%for groups 1 and 2, respectively. There were no
significant differences between the two groups in terms of survival or postoperative fertility
outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analysis further revealed that ovarian cystectomy was not a
poor prognostic indicator for disease-free survival.
Conclusion: These current data suggest that ovarian cystectomy can be considered for patients
with apparent early-stage immature teratoma as it preserves fertility as much as possible without
adversely impacting upon survival.

Introduction
Pure immature teratomas are the second
most common type of malignant ovarian
germ cell tumour (MOGCT) and constitute
approximately 30% of all MOGCT cases.1
This tumour principally manifests in girls
and young women, for whom the preserva-
tion of fertility is extremely important.2
Fortunately, immature teratoma is a poten-
tially curable condition as most cases exhibit
excellent sensitivity to chemotherapy.3,4
This provides physicians with a significant
chance of preserving fertility, even in
patients with advanced stages of disease.
Furthermore, most of the patients are
diagnosed at an early stage.5 For example,
in a Canadian cohort of 34 patients, 32
patients (94.1%) were diagnosed with
International Federation of Gynecology
and Obstetrics stage I.6 The National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
recommends that for these early-stage
patients the standard treatment should be
fertility-sparing surgery in the form of uni-
lateral salpingo-oophorectomy (USO) with
comprehensive staging procedures.7
However, carrying out salpingo-oophor-
ectomy will inevitably compromise fertility
as the affected ovary is permanently
resected. In order to preserve fertility as
much as possible, ovarian cystectomy is
undoubtedly better than excising the whole
ovary as this practice would minimize loss of
normal cortex tissue. Several studies have
investigated ovarian function following cyst-
ectomy in other conditions, such as ovarian
endometrioma.8­10 One study reported a
transient reduction in anti-Mu
¨ llerian hor-
mone (AMH), an indicator of ovarian
reserve; however, after 6 months, the
AMH levels had recovered and by 12
months after surgery they had returned to
normal.8 Another study reported a slight but
nonsignificant reduction in serum
AMH if cystectomy was implemented with-
out using bipolar coagulation.9
However, cystectomy may involve a risk
of leaving residual tumour within the
remaining ovarian tissue. Immature tera-
tomas are characterized by the fact that if
recurrent, these tumours may develop into
mature teratomas.4 For example, a previous
study reported that from 34 patients, four
patients experienced malignant relapse of
immature teratoma, while three patients
relapsed in the form of a mature teratoma.6
Furthermore, even if immature teratomas
reoccur in a malignant form, most patients
can be treated effectively because such
tumours exhibit excellent sensitivity to
chemotherapy.6,11
Based upon these facts, this present study
hypothesized that cystectomy could be con-
sidered for immature teratomas in patients
diagnosed at an early stage. Because of the
rarity of this tumour, there has been no
specific study of this type as yet, although
there have been a few sporadic cases
reported previously (Table 1).3,6,11,12 In the
largest set of seven patients receiving cyst-
ectomy; only one patient with a stage IA
grade 1 tumour relapsed with a mature
teratoma 3 months later.6 In a study of
two patients (one of stage IA grade 1, and
the other of stage IA grade 2) undergoing
cystectomy without chemotherapy, neither
patient relapsed.11 A report of a single
patient (stage IC grade 1) who received
bilateral cystectomy followed by three
cycles of the bleomycin, etoposide and cis-
platin (BEP) regimen demonstrated that the
patient did not relapse over a 39-month
follow-up period.12 These 10 cases support
the hypothesis that cystectomy might be a
safe option for patients with early-stage
immature teratomas.6,11,12
This present study reviewed a cohort of
patients with apparent early-stage immature
teratoma over a 19-year period in an
Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital in
Shanghai, China. The aim of the study was
to investigate whether performing cystec-
tomy instead of USO would compromise the
772 Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
survival rates of patients with early-stage
immature teratoma.
Patients and methods
Patient population
This retrospective study enrolled consecu-
tive patients surgically treated in the
Department of Gynaecology, Obstetrics
and Gynaecology Hospital of Fudan
University, Shanghai, China between
January 1997 and December 2015.
Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) patho-
logical diagnosis of a pure immature tera-
toma; (ii) gross confinement of malignant
lesions to the ovary (or ovaries) as reported
in the surgical report; (iii) patients who
received fertility-sparing surgery. The exclu-
sion criteria were as follows: (i) patients with
malignant tumours originated from sites
other than the ovaries; (ii) patients possess-
ing immature teratoma and other histo-
logical types of MOGCT at the same time
as revealed by the pathological report; (iii)
patients with malignant lesions of immature
teratoma outside of the ovaries as reported
in the surgical report; (iv) patients whose
fertility was not spared during surgery.
This study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Obstetrics and
Gynaecology Hospital of Fudan University
(approval number: 2016-21). Written
informed consent was obtained from all
patients.
Data collection
The following parameters were retrieved
from medical records: age, parity, tumour
diameter, b-human chorionic gonadotropin
(b-HCG) levels, the widely-used tumour
markers serum cancer antigen (CA) 125
and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), histopath-
ology, surgical details and information
relating to adjuvant chemotherapy.
Patients were followed in the outpatient
department to determine clinical outcome
such as recurrence, death or survival, along
with reproductive outcome, such as resump-
tion of menstruation and pregnancy.
All histological slides were reviewed by
two independent pathologists. Immature
teratomas were graded according to the
criteria developed previously.13 Fertility-
sparing surgery was defined as preservation
of the uterus and at least part of an ovary.
Comprehensive staging surgery included
cytological analysis of the peritoneal cavity
fluid, excision of suspicious nodules of the
peritoneum, infracolic omentectomy and
pelvic lymphadenectomy.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Continuous variables are
described as mean Æ SD. The Student's t-test

while 2-test orFisher'sexact test wereused to
compare categorical variables. Spearman cor-
relation analysis was used to investigate the
correlationsbetweencovariates.Survivalana-
lysis was constructed using the Kaplan­Meier
method. Following univariate analysis with
log-rank test, a Cox regression model was
employed to account for the potential effects
of confounding factors. A P-value < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
During the 19-year study period, 51 females
with pure immature teratoma were identi-
fied. Of these, 47 patients (92.2%) had
malignant lesions confined to the ovary.
Application of the full inclusion criteria
resulted in a final cohort of 43 patients
with a mean Æ SD age of 22.0 Æ 6.0 years
(range, 10­39 years). The mean Æ SD
tumour diameter was 147.6 Æ 43.3 mm
(range, 46­250 mm). None of the patients
tested positive for b-HCG. Serum CA125
and AFP was available for 35 and 33
patients, respectively. In total, six and eight
patients were classified as being within the
normal range for CA125 (<35 U/ml) or
AFP (<10 ng/ml), respectively. The study
cohort included 22, 15 and six patients of
grade 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Spearman
correlation analysis revealed that the AFP
level was positively correlated with tumour
grade (r ¼ 0.37, P < 0.05) and the detection
of immature teratoma in frozen tissue sec-
tions (r ¼ 0.47, P < 0.05).
All patients exhibited unilateral immature
teratomas, although 12 patients also pos-
sessed a mature teratoma in the contralateral
ovary (Table 2). Comprehensive staging sur-
gery (cytological analysis of the peritoneal
cavity fluid, infracolic omentectomy and
pelvic lymphadenectomy) was performed in
only three patients. Nevertheless, cytological
analysis of peritoneal washings, lymph node
dissection, and omentectomy were performed
in 14, 10, and 10 patients, respectively. None
of these samples tested positive for malig-
nancy and no residual lesions were left in any
patients. In total, 32 of 43 patients (74.4%)
received adjuvant chemotherapy following
surgery. The BEP and cisplatin, vincristine,
and bleomycin (PVB) regimens were admin-
istered to seven and 14 patients, respectively.
In addition, the vincristine, actinomycin, and
cyclophosphamide (VAC) regimen, an older
regimen used to treat MOGCTs in the
1990s,14­16 was provided to one patient.
From the study cohort, 14 patients
received ovarian cystectomy and were cate-
gorized as group 1. Ovarian cystectomy was
carried out in these patients for the following
reasons: (i) frozen sections during surgery
presented a primary diagnosis of mature
teratoma (one patient) or suspected imma-
ture teratoma but without proof of immature
neural tissue (12 patients); (ii) the lack of
frozen sections for analysis (one patient). The
29 remaining patients received USO and were
categorized as group 2. Demographic and
clinical data for these two groups are
presented in Table 2. AFP levels were signifi-
cantly higher in group 2 (P ¼ 0.013).
Furthermore, a significantly higher propor-
tion of patients in group 2 underwent
cytological analysis of peritoneal washings
(P ¼ 0.013), omentectomy (P ¼ 0.012) and
pelvic lymphadectomy (P ¼ 0.012). There
was no significant difference in age, tumour
size, tumour grade or CA125 level.
Three patients (7.0%) were lost during
the median follow-up period of 41 months
(range, 4­207 months); one was from group
1 and the other two were from group 2.
Three patients, all from group 2, experi-
enced a relapse. Detailed information
relating to recurrence in the three patients
from group 2 is presented in Table 3. None
of the patients in either group died during
follow-up. There was no significant
between-group difference in the 5-year
DFS, which was 100% for group 1 and
88%for group 2 (Figure 1). Univariate
774 Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
analyses using log-rank tests showed that the
following factors were not poor prognostic
factors for DFS: age (!25 years), laterality,
tumour grade, comprehensive staging sur-
gery, the practice of cystectomy, CA125
level (!500 U/ml), AFP level (!40 ng/ml),
or more than three cycles of chemotherapy.
There was no significant difference in DFS
of patients treated with either the BEP or
PVB regimens. However, univariate ana-
lyses showed that use of the VAC regimen
was significantly associated with DFS
(P < 0.001) when tested by log-rank test.

Prior to surgery, all patients had regular
menstruation cycles except one premenarchal
patient in group 2. Data regarding menstrual
status and pregnancy after surgery was avail-
able for 13 and 26 patients in group 1 and 2,
respectively (Table 2). Of these, 12 patients
(85.7%) in group 1 and 25 patients in group 2
(86.2%) resumed normal menstrual cycles.
Five patients (35.7%) in group 1 and six
patients (20.7%) in group 2 delivered healthy

Discussion
Pure immature teratomas are rare and rep-
resent less than 1% of all ovarian cancers.17
A study undertaken in 580 patients diag-
nosed with ovarian teratoma identified only
24 immature cases (4.1%).18 The majority of
patients are diagnosed at an early stage.6 In
this present study, 92.2% (47/51) of patients
were diagnosed with apparent early-stage
teratoma with lesions confined to the ovary.
Survival is closely associated with disease
stage. For example, the overall survival rate
was 91.6% when all stages were considered,
but only 80% for patients with advanced
stages of disease.12 This present study
demonstrated a 5-year overall survival rate
for our cohort of apparent early-stage
patients of 100%. Patients with a higher
tumour grade are reported to have a higher
rate of recurrence.19 However, in this pre-
sent cohort, tumour grade was not found to
be a useful prognostic factor for DFS. This
may be due to the excellent survival rate of
this present cohort of early-stage patients.

the NCCN, is USO plus comprehensive
staging.7 Routine biopsy of the unaffected
ovary is unnecessary because immature
teratoma is almost always unilateral.3 It
has also been suggested that comprehensive
staging procedures can be omitted without
compromising survival. For example, of 23
patients with pure immature teratomas who
did not receive comprehensive staging, only
one patient relapsed and recovered after
four cycles of etoposide and cisplatin
chemotherapy.3 Another study, based upon
the `Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results' programme, showed that lympha-
denectomy does not provide any significant
benefit to the survival of patients affected by
immature teratoma.20 In this present cohort
of 43 patients, only three patients received
comprehensive staging surgery but the sur-
vival outcomes were satisfactory. The over-
all analysis in the present study also showed
that comprehensive staging surgery was not
a useful prognostic factor for DFS.
Collectively, this suggests that comprehen-
sive staging procedures can be omitted for
patients with apparent early-stage teratoma
without compromising survival. In fact,
some researchers have considered that the
role of surgical staging in this disease was to
avoid adjuvant chemotherapy for low grade
early-stage tumours.12
In the present study, none of the 14
patients who received cystectomy relapsed
during follow-up and cystectomy was not
shown to be a poor prognostic factor for
DFS. Furthermore, none of these 14

patients were comprehensively staged
during surgery. These current findings sug-
gest that the application of cystectomy
without comprehensive staging surgery is a
safe option for patients with apparent early-
stage teratoma.
The BEP protocol is the standard chemo-
therapy regimen recommended by the
NCCN and is the most widely used strat-
egy.7 However, the PVB regimen can also be
effective and is widely used in China.21 In
this present study, there was no significant
difference in the survival rates of patients
treated with either the BEP or PVB regi-
mens. The NCCN supports the omission of
adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
stage I, grade 1 immature teratoma based
upon the fact that comprehensive staging is
adopted.22 Over recent years, the role of
chemotherapy in the treatment of early-
stage immature teratoma has become
increasingly questioned. For example, the
MITO-9 trial strongly suggested that phys-
icians should not adopt chemotherapy in the
primary setting but rather apply this strat-
egy only in cases of recurrence for all grades
of stage I tumour.11 Furthermore, a recent
report showed that adjuvant chemotherapy
did not reduce the chance of relapse in
paediatric patients although the situation
in adult patients was not clear.23 This pre-
sent study also considered whether it was
safe to omit both staging procedures and
chemotherapy and perform only cystectomy
for these early-stage patients. In the 14
patients receiving cystectomy, none were
comprehensively staged while eight patients
received adjuvant chemotherapy. However,
the present study was not able to reach a
definitive conclusion because no relapses
were observed in this group of patients.
This present study demonstrated that
there were no significant differences between
cystectomy and USO in terms of the
resumption of normal menstruation or preg-
nancy rate following surgery. However,
several young patients were not ready for
pregnancy, were unmarried, or were taking
contraceptive measures.
In this present cohort, cystectomy was
performed mainly (13/14, 92.9%) in patients
with frozen sections that failed to confirm
the presence of immature neural tissue,
although malignancy was suspected in 12
patients according to gross examination.
This casts doubt over whether patients in
the cystectomy group possessed malignant
lesions smaller than those of the USO group,
which may further impact upon prognosis of
the patients. The quantity of malignant
lesions, more specifically the immature
neural tissue, is closely related to the grade
of the tumour.24,25 If hardly any immature
neural tissue can be detected under high-
power microscopy when sampling properly,
then the tumour should be designated grade
1.13 However, the final pathology report
proved that eight patients were diagnosed
with grade 1 while the other five were
verified as grade 2. When preparing samples
for frozen sections, only one small piece of
tissue was sampled. Both the experience of
the pathologist and the limited volume of
sampled tissue may have resulted in the
failure to collect a sample that included
malignant tissue.
Twenty-five patients (25/33, 75.8%) in
this present cohort presented with abnormal
serum AFP levels. The Pediatric Oncology
Group and the Children's Cancer Group
have reported that 44.8% patients with
immature teratomas were confirmed to
have co-existing microscopic foci of endo-
dermal sinus tumour (EST), especially in
grade 2 or 3 tumours.26 Although no micro-
scopic foci of EST were reported in this
present study, if the tumours had been
examined more closely, then tiny EST foci
might have been detected. Spearman correl-
ation analysis showed that the AFP level
was positively correlated with tumour grade
in the present study. Although significantly
higher AFP levels were found in group 2
compared with group 1, no significant
778 Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
difference in the tumour grades was detected
between the two groups. Furthermore,
although AFP levels differed between the
two groups, elevated AFP (!40 ng/ml)
before surgery was not a prognostic factor
for DFS in this present cohort.
This study had several limitations. First,
it was retrospective and may have been
affected by selection bias. Secondly, the
sample size was small. Unfortunately, it
was difficult to compile a larger cohort, or
to carry out either a prospective or rando-
mized controlled trial, because of the rarity
of this tumour. Any disparity between the
two groups did not appear to impact upon
the results.
In conclusion, to the best of our know-
ledge, this is the first study to investigate the
role of cystectomy in patients with apparent
early-stage immature teratoma. These pre-
sent data suggest that cystectomy could be
considered for patients with apparent early-
stage immature teratoma without compro-
mising survival.
