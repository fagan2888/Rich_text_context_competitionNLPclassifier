TOOTH DECAY IS THE MOST COM-
mon chronic childhood dis-
ease; annual treatment costs in
the United States are esti-
mated to be at least $4.5 billion.1,2 If left
untreated, tooth decay can result in sub-
stantial morbidity due to pain, dysfunc-
tion, poor appearance, and possibly
problems with speech development. In
the past 50 years, probably as a result
of dentifrices and increased levels of
fluoride in drinking water, pediatric
dental caries occurrence in the United
States has declined dramatically; nev-
ertheless, there remain important dis-
parities in caries prevalence within the
population.3,4 In particular, young chil-
dren living in poverty constitute the 1
subgroup in which there has been little
progress in reduction of caries.5 Hence,
it is especially important to identify
modifiable risk factors for caries in this
group.
Dental decay appears to be an infec-
tious disease that involves coloniza-
tion by Streptococcus mutans; these bac-
teria produce lactic acid from the
fermentation of carbohydrates, and the
acid dissolves the surface structure of
teeth.6 However, why some children are
particularly vulnerable to decay is
poorly understood.7 We hypothesized
that environmental tobacco smoke
(ETS), a common cause of pediatric
morbidity and mortality that dispro-
portionately affects children in low so-
cioeconomic status environments, may
be a risk factor for cavities.8-13 Environ-
mental tobacco smoke has previously
been shown to be associated with peri-
odontal disease in adults.14 Moreover,
there are increasing experimental data
supporting the biological plausibility of
a causal role for ETS in caries forma-
tion. Research indicates that the bac-
teria responsible for caries formation are
acquired in infancy from the saliva of
mothers (via kissing, etc).7 Elsewhere,
nicotine has been shown to promote the
growth of cariogenic S mutans bacte-
ria in vitro; thus, mothers who smoke
may be more likely than nonsmokers
to transmit these germs to their chil-
dren.15 Environmental tobacco smoke
has immunosuppressive properties and
is a known risk factor for infections of
the cranial organs (eg, otitis media);
thus it is not surprising that it would
be a risk factor for caries develop-
ment, which is an oral infectious dis-
ease.16,17 In addition, ETS is associated
with decreased serum vitamin C lev-
els in children and decreased levels of

Context Dental decay is the most common chronic disease of children and it dis-
proportionately affects those living in poverty, but the reasons for this are not clear.
Passive smoking may be a modifiable risk factor for dental caries.
Objective To examine the relationship between dental caries and serum cotinine
levels.
Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional data from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) of 3531 children aged 4 to 11
years, who had had both dental examinations and a serum cotinine level measure-
ment.
Main Outcome Measures Passive smoking defined as serum cotinine levels of 0.2
to 10 ng/mL and caries defined as decayed (unfilled) or filled tooth surfaces.
Results Twenty-five percent of the children had at least 1 unfilled decayed tooth
surface and 33% had at least 1 filled surface. Fifty-three percent had cotinine levels
consistent with passive smoking. Elevated cotinine level was significantly associated
with both decayed (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.9) and
filled (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8) tooth surfaces in deciduous but not in permanent
teeth. This relationship persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race, family income, geo-
graphic region, frequency of dental visits, and blood lead level. For dental caries in
deciduous teeth, the adjusted OR was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.2-2.7) for the risk of decayed
surfaces and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1-2.0) for filled surfaces. We estimated the population
attributable risk from passive smoking to be 27% for decayed and 14% for filled tooth
surfaces.
Conclusions There is an association between environmental tobacco smoke and risk
of caries among children. Reduction of passive smoking is important not only for the
prevention of many medical problems, but also for the promotion of children's dental
health.

vitamin C are associated with growth
of cariogenic bacteria.18,19 Also, it is pos-
sible that ETS may reduce the protec-
tive properties of saliva that operate
against caries--saliva acts as a buffer-
ing agent when acids are produced, it
physically removes debris from tooth
surfaces, and it has immunological and
bacteriostatic properties.20 Environ-
mental tobacco smoke is known to in-
crease inflammation of the respiratory
tract, producing symptoms of various
clinical conditions, including allergic
rhinitis, which frequently cause mouth
breathing and thus result in dry mouth
(ie, an effective decrease in saliva).21
Thus, ETS could promote dental de-
cay both through a direct effect of nico-
tine on caries-causing bacterial agents,
as well as via other systemic physiologi-
cal changes in the host.
The decline in caries among US chil-
dren has occurred mainly in perma-
nent and not deciduous teeth.7 If pas-
sive smoking does cause caries, there
are reasons to expect the effect to be
most pronounced in early childhood.
Colonization with the cariogenic S mu-
tans is thought to occur during a win-
dow of vulnerability around age 1 year,
and primary teeth are particularly sus-
ceptible to caries formation soon after
their eruption.6 One can also hypoth-
esizespecificmechanismsbywhichETS
exposure may be more likely to cause
caries in deciduous rather than in per-
manent teeth. For example, it is known
that the enamel in deciduous teeth is
much thinner than in permanent teeth,
and that enamel defects are associated
with caries.22 Also, maternal smoking
is a principal risk factor for prematu-
rity, low birth weight, and chronic ill-
ness in infancy, while these in turn are
all associated with generalized enamel
hypoplasia in the primary denti-
tion.6,10,23 Furthermore, in early child-
hood, when the immune system is gen-
erally less mature, the saliva is known
to be different from that of adults with
respect to IgA concentrations; in addi-
tion, salivary flow rate is lower.24 Young
children may thus be particularly vul-
nerable to the harmful effects of ETS on
the immune system and saliva flow.
Hence, it is it biologically plausible that
passive smoking could cause caries, par-
ticularly in early childhood.
The purpose of this study was to ex-
amine the association between pas-
sive smoking and dental caries by us-
ing data collected in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES III), which includes a na-
tionally representative sample of chil-
dren who had both a complete dental
examination and a serum cotinine level
measurement, which is an objective,
quantitative biomarker of ETS.
METHODS
NHANES III (1988-1994) is a cross-
sectional survey that includes personal
household interviews and health exami-
nations for approximately 4000 chil-
dren aged 4 to 11 years. The household
interview collected demographic, socio-
economic,dietary,andhealthhistoryin-
formation. The examination compo-
nent consisted of physical and dental
examinations and various laboratory
tests using blood and urine specimens.
Only children aged 4 years or older
had blood specimens for serum coti-
nine level taken, so younger children
wereexcludedfromtheseanalyses.Chil-
dren aged 12 years or older were ex-
cluded to reduce possible confusion re-
sulting from early active smoking. For
the same reason, we also excluded chil-
dren with a cotinine level higher than
10 ng/mL (only 23 children 12 years
had a cotinine level 10 ng/mL). A li-
censed dentist performed the dental ex-
amination. Details of the methods used
in the oral health component of the
survey have been published previ-
ously.25-27 Forchildrenaged4to11years
with at least 1 deciduous tooth, de-
cayed and filled primary surfaces were
analyzed. We analyzed filled and un-
filled dental surfaces separately to help
elucidate the interplay of access to den-
tal care with environmental factors. The
categories were not mutually exclu-
sive: a child could have both filled and
decayed (unfilled) surfaces. For per-
sons aged 6 years or older with at least
1 permanent tooth, the permanent sur-
faces were analyzed. For this study, sub-
jects were categorized as either having
any caries or being caries-free.
The primary independent variable of
interest was ETS exposure as reflected
by a serum cotinine level of 0.2 ng/mL
or greater, but less than 10 ng/mL. This
cutoff approximately divides the non-
smoking population into those with
above or below median ETS expo-
sure.11 For the dose-response analysis,
serum cotinine level was divided into 4
categories. A cotinine level of less than
0.05 ng/mL was below the limit of de-
tection;alevelof0.05ng/mLtolessthan
0.2 ng/mL was considered low expo-
sure; a level of 0.2 to 1.0 ng/mL, mod-
erate exposure; and a level greater than
1, high exposure. Other potential inde-
pendent associations with dental caries
were analyzed, including the subjects'
age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, re-
gionofresidence,educationlevelofhead
of household, blood lead level, use of
dental services, and sugar intake. Low
socioeconomic status was defined as a
poverty income ratio below 2. The pov-
erty income ratio is the total family in-
comedividedbythefederalpovertylevel
for the year of the interview. This defi-
nition of poverty was used because,
based on previous NHANES III stud-
ies, it is a good cutoff for pediatric car-
ies risk.28 Use of oral health services was
determined by the length of time since
the last visit to a dentist. Caries forma-
tion may be related to prolonged expo-
sure to carbohydrates, especially su-
crose.29 As there is no recommended
daily intake of candy, we defined high
sugar intake as at or above the median
of 45.3 g/d. NHANES III also includes
variables for parental report of prenatal
or postnatal smoking. We verified that
these variables also demonstrated a sig-
nificant association with caries, but re-
stricted the analyses to the use of se-
rumcotininelevelasthemeasureofETS
exposure because it is objective and
quantitative.
Bivariate (unadjusted) analyses were
conducted to determine associations
with caries status. Variables found to
be statistically significant based on the
2 test were included in logistic regres-
sion analyses to determine indepen-

dent associations with caries-free sta-
tus. Performing the analyses with
cotinine level as a continuous (as op-
posed to a categorical) variable did not
substantively change the findings. Vari-
ables in the logistic regression models
were screened for colinearity by exam-
ining correlation coefficients in bivar-
iate analyses. SUDAAN software was
used to account for the complex mul-
tistage sampling design of the sur-
vey.30 Sample weights were used to pro-
duce national estimates by adjusting for
the oversampling of young children and
older adults as well as for Mexican
American and black individuals. P.05
was the level of significance.
Population attributable risk esti-
mates were derived using the Levin for-
mula
Population Attributable Risk =
[Prevalence  (Relative Risk - 1)]
[1 + (Prevalence  {Relative Risk - 1})]
in which prevalence is the prevalence
of exposure to the risk factor in the
population.31 Relative risk is esti-
mated from the observed odds ratio
(OR) using the method of Zhang and
Yu.32 The following prevalence data spe-
cific to this population sample were
used in the population attributable risk
calculations: ETS exposure of 53%, de-
cayed primary surfaces in unexposed
children of 18.2%, and filled surfaces
of 29.2%.
RESULTS
A total of 3873 individuals aged 4 to 11
years were included in the analysis; of
these, 3531 had at least 1 deciduous
tooth and 2930 had at least 1 perma-
nent tooth. Overall, 53.1% (n = 2057)
of these children had cotinine levels
consistent with ETS exposure, 46.7%
(n = 1809) had decayed or filled sur-
faces in primary teeth, and 26.2%
(n = 1015) had decayed or filled sur-
faces in permanent teeth.
Inbivariateanalyses,weexaminedthe
associationofcotininelevelandotherpo-
tential risk factors with the occurrence
of caries in deciduous and permanent
teeth (TABLE 1). There were statisti-
callysignificantassociationsbetweense-
rum cotinine level and caries in decidu-
ous teeth. The OR for decayed surfaces
was 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI],
1.5-2.9) and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1-1.8) for
filled surfaces. In addition to cotinine
level, poverty and low level of educa-
tion of household head were signifi-
cantly associated with increased risk of
both decayed and filled teeth. Black and
MexicanAmericanrace/ethnicityandun-
deruse of dental services were associ-
atedwithmoredecayedsurfacesbutwith
significantly fewer fillings. Residence in
the southern region of the United States
increasedtheriskofdecay,butnotoffill-
ings. Age was not related to the risk of
decayedsurfaces,butolderchildrenwere
more likely to have more fillings. High
sugarintakeandsexofthechildwerenot
correlated with higher risk for either de-
cayed or filled surfaces. Elevated blood
lead level correlated with significantly
fewer fillings.
Inpermanentteeth,theassociationbe-
tween cotinine level and caries was not
statistically significant. The OR for de-
cayed surfaces was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.9-
2.2) and 1.1 (95% CI, 0.8-1.5) for filled
surfaces.Inadditiontocotininelevel,sex
of the child, region of residence, sugar
intake,andbloodleadlevelwerenotsig-
nificantly associated with either filled or
unfilled surfaces. Poverty, low level of
education of household head, and non-
whiterace/ethnicityweresignificantlyas-
sociated with increased risk of decayed
butnotfilledsurfaces.Blackchildrenand
those with infrequent visits to the den-
tistweresignificantlymorelikelytohave
decay, but had significantly fewer fill-
ings. Age was significantly related to the
risk of both decayed and filled surfaces.
The logistic regression analyses ad-
justed for age, race/ethnicity, level of
education of household head, pov-
erty, blood lead level, days since last
dental visit, and geographic region
(TABLE 2). Sugar intake and sex were
not included in the multivariate mod-
els since they were not significant fac-
tors in bivariate analyses. Testing for
colinearity revealed no significant re-
lationships between variables in-
cluded in the logistic regression model.
Cotinine level remained a signifi-
cant predictor of caries in deciduous
teeth. Adjusted OR for decayed sur-
faces was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.2-2.7) and 1.4
(95%CI,1.1-2.0)forfilledsurfaces.Pov-
erty was the only other variable that re-
mained a significant independent risk
factor for both decayed and filled sur-
faces. Underuse of dental services was
significantly associated with more de-
cayed surfaces and with fewer fillings.
The association between low educa-
tional level of the household head and
decayedorfilledsurfacesdidnotachieve
statistical significance. Mexican Ameri-
can ethnicity was associated with more
decayedsurfaces,whereasblackracewas
associated with a significantly de-
creased number of fillings. Residence in
the West was weakly associated with
more fillings but not with more de-
cayed surfaces. Age was not related to
the risk of decayed surfaces, but older
children were more likely to have more
fillings.Elevatedbloodleadlevelwasnot
significantly related to decayed sur-
faces and was associated with a signifi-
cant decrease in the risk of fillings. Ana-
lyzing for interactions revealed that the
effect of tobacco was neither increased
nor decreased by having an elevated
blood lead level.
For permanent teeth, in the ad-
justed analyses, ETS was still not a sig-
nificant risk factor for caries, nor were
poverty, region of residence, or el-
evated blood lead level. Nonwhite chil-
dren were significantly more likely to
have decayed surfaces, but black chil-
dren were significantly less likely to
have fillings, as were children who had
not seen a dentist in the past year. Low
education level of household head was
significantly associated with fillings.
The likelihood of both decayed and
filled surfaces increased with age.
For caries risk in deciduous teeth,
there was evidence suggestive of a dose-
response trend (TABLE 3). With se-
rum cotinine level divided into 4 cat-
egories (rather than 2 as above), we
found that in general, as ETS in-
creased, so did the risk of caries. The
trend for unfilled surfaces persisted af-
ter adjusting for the subjects' age, race,

family income, geographic region of
residence, education level of head of
household, blood lead level, and den-
tal service use across all 4 cotinine lev-
els. For filled surfaces, the trend was
suggested for the first 3 categories, but
not for the highest cotinine level.
Based on the ORs reported in Table
2 for the association of risk between co-
tinine level and caries, the population
attributable risk is estimated to be 27%
for unfilled caries occurrence in de-
ciduous teeth. In other words, a quar-
ter of the children who have caries in
deciduous teeth could be caries-free if
ETS exposure were eliminated. For
filled surfaces, the population attribut-
able risk is 13.7%.
COMMENT
This study, based on a nationally rep-
resentative sample and using objec-
tive measures of both ETS and caries,
found a statistically significant associa-
tion between cotinine level and risk of
caries, after controlling for numerous
potential confounders. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first report

ofanassociationbetweenpassivesmoke
exposure and dental caries in US chil-
dren. Previous reports on the oral health
of children in the United States have not
considered ETS as a possible risk fac-
tor for caries.2,3,27,33-36 A literature search
revealed only 1 other study specifi-
cally investigating the link between ETS
and caries: it was conducted in the
United Kingdom (UK National Diet and
Nutrition Survey) and yielded results
consistent with those we found in the
United States.37 Our investigation has
the additional strengths of using coti-
nine level, rather than subjective pa-
rental report, to estimate ETS expo-
sure, and it studies a broader age range
than the UK study, which included only
3- and 4-year-olds.
These data, in general, also suggest a
dose-responserelationshipbetweenchil-
dren's cotinine levels and the likeli-
hoodofhavingcariesindeciduousteeth,
even after controlling for multiple po-
tential confounders. However, the rela-
tionship for unfilled cavities (decayed
surfaces) leveled off at the highest quar-
tile, and for the filled surfaces the risk
decreased from the third to the fourth
dose categories. It is possible that there
isathresholdabovewhichchildren'srisk
for caries does not continue to increase
further. In addition, there may be an-
other explanation for filled surfaces.
Filled status is determined not only by
biological formation of caries, but also
by subsequent dental care. Hence, the
dose-responserelationshipbetweenETS
and caries formation may be masked if
families allow their children to be ex-
posed to very high levels of ETS and also
fail to take their children in for dental
visits to get fillings. Further study of the
dose-response relationship is war-
ranted. While we are unable to explain
why children with the highest cotinine
levelsdonotappeartohaveahigherrisk
for caries on filled surfaces than chil-
dren in the next highest cotinine cat-
egory, and their risk of having caries is
not statistically significant at P.05
when compared with children with the
lowest cotinine levels, their OR was in
fact 1.5 and marginally significant at
P.07. It may be that there is a thresh-
oldofexposuretoETSabovewhichchil-
dren's risk for caries does not continue
to increase further.
We cannot demonstrate conclu-
sively that passive smoking is causally
linked to dental caries on the basis of

observational data alone. The cross-
sectional nature of the data also im-
poses limitations on the ability to test
mechanism-specific hypotheses.38 For
example, if ETS exposure at the time
of enamel formation is the most rel-
evant mechanism, ideally one would
need to analyze cotinine levels during
infancy. We did not have data on co-
tinine levels for children younger than
4 years, and do not know if current co-
tinine levels are good estimates of ETS
exposure in infancy. Our finding that
ETS was associated with caries in de-
ciduous but not permanent teeth is con-
sistent with the hypothesis that expo-
sure in early life is important for the
effect on dental health. The study re-
sults are consistent with what is known
regarding the pathophysiological char-
acteristics of caries formation and are
therefore biologically plausible.
Nevertheless, the main difficulty with
interpreting this study is the possibility
that serum cotinine level is simply a
marker for some unmeasured true cause
of caries formation. For example, be-
cause smoking is an unhealthy behav-
ior, it could be that parents who smoke
also practice other unhealthy behav-
iors that would put their children at risk
for cavities (eg, not brushing teeth, not
using fluoride toothpaste, not going to
the dentist, eating too much candy, etc).
Unfortunately, NHANES III does not in-
clude a variable for tooth brushing or
other oral hygiene practices. We at-
tempted to control for inadequate den-
tal care by including a variable for use
of dental services. Rarity of dental vis-
its was a predictor of fewer fillings, but
it was not related to decayed surfaces.
Cotininelevelremainedasignificantpre-
dictor of both decayed and filled sur-
faces, even after including this variable
intheregressionmodel.Thefindingthat
level of parental education dropped out
of the model also argues against ETS
being merely a marker for health behav-
iors associated with low socioeco-
nomic status. Although there is a popu-
lar perception that cavities are caused
primarily by excessive dietary sugar, our
finding that sucrose intake was not re-
lated to caries prevalence is consistent
with the scientific literature on the
topic.29,34,37 Although public water sup-
plies serve the same water to individu-
als with a range of tobacco exposure lev-
els, one must also consider whether
tobacco exposure is simply a marker for
residence in an area that is not served
by fluoridated drinking water, inas-
much as fluoride exposure is strongly
linked to dental caries risk.2 However,
ETS exposure is highest in urban areas,
and that is where people are most likely
to have fluoridated water.2,12 NHANES
IIIdoesnotprovideinformationonfluo-
rideexposure,sofurtherstudyisneeded
to resolve this issue. Overall though, it
appears that ETS is not simply a marker
for poor dental health behaviors or for
lack of fluoride.
In addition to the need for more com-
prehensive information on risk factors
for caries, one of the limitations of this
study is the age of the data. However,
these are the most recent NHANES oral
health data available, and there exists a
general consensus that early childhood
caries in poor children remains a major
problem.2 For cotinine level though,
there are more recent national data, and
these indicate that despite reductions in
smoking in the overall population, the
proportion of US children exposed to
ETS is still more than 50%.39 This is
likely due to the ubiquity of tobacco
smoke exposure in urban environ-
ments(evenforchildrenwithnonsmok-
ingparents),andthefactthatchildren--
especially preschool age children--are
disproportionately affected by pov-
erty.12,13,40 Thus it would appear that the
findings presented here regarding den-
tal decay, child poverty, and tobacco
smoke exposure are, unfortunately, still
relevant.
Small geographic differences in the
prevalence of dental caries in US school-
children have been previously re-
ported.41 Inourunadjustedanalysis,resi-
dence in the South was associated with
highercariesprevalence,althoughtheas-
sociation was not significant in the mul-
tivariate model. Given that children in
the South have an above average preva-
lence of exposure to ETS, these results
are consistent with the hypothesis that
passive smoking plays a role in the geo-
graphic variation in caries prevalence.42
However, NHANES III was not de-
signed to account for seasonal variation
in ETS exposure, and this may intro-
duce measurement error in the assess-
ment of regional patterns. For practical
reasons, the mobile examination cen-
terssampledindividualsfromtheNorth-
east and Midwest during summer
months and in the West and South dur-
ing winter months.43 This arrangement
tendstominimizeobservedcotininelev-
els (because people spend more time in-
doors in extreme cold or hot weather
than at other times, and ETS exposure
is higher indoors than outdoors).44
Another bias in our study that would
tendtoclassifyexposedchildrenasunex-
posedandthusreducetheobservedORs
is the cotinine level cutoff of 0.2 ng/mL
used to define ETS exposure. This is a
conservativedefinitionoftheupperlimit
of nonexposure as it represents a level
that is well above the limit of detection
with the technique used in NHANES III
(0.05 ng/mL), and it corresponds to a
medium low exposure level, slightly
lower than the median cotinine level
amongnonusersoftobacco.11,45,46 Indeed,
the use of lower cutoffs in the dose-
response analysis yielded higher ORs.
The association between poverty sta-
tus and dental caries in the NHANES III
data has been the topic of a previous
study: as family income increased, chil-
dren were less likely to have any de-
cayed teeth.28 The finding that poverty
remains a significant predictor of de-
cay and fillings after controlling for ETS
suggests that there are other unmea-
suredaspectsofpovertythatincreasethe
formation of caries. In addition, pov-
erty remains an important determinant
of reduced access to dental care.47 The
increased risk of caries in Mexican
American children is consistent with
previous reports.28 Black children, along
with children with infrequent visits to
the dentist, were significantly less likely
to have fillings despite being more likely
toexperiencedecay--thissuggestsagap
in access to dental care for black chil-
dren, which is also consistent with the
recent literature.48

Elevated blood lead level did not
increase the risk of decay and was
also significantly associated with
decreased odds of having fillings.
However, a previous study that found
an association between blood lead
level and caries used different meth-
ods that might be more sensitive for
detecting an association with blood
lead level.49 The relationship between
blood lead level and caries requires
further study.
These findings underscore the need
for further investigation of risk factors
forcaries formation, especially in early
childhood. Future studies of the bio-
logical effects of ETS and other pollut-
ants should examine oral health out-
comes, such as caries. If a causal
association between passive smoking
and dental caries is substantiated, then
health interventions for dental caries
should include strategies to reduce ETS
exposure. These results provide one
more piece of evidence indicating that
passive smoking is harmful and that all
children should be allowed to grow up
in a smoke-free environment.50
