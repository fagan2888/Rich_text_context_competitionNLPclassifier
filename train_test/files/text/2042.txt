Abstract
Background: Surveillance and response to diabetes may be accelerated through engaging online diabetes social networks
(SNs) in consented research. We tested the willingness of an online diabetes community to share data for public health
research by providing members with a privacy-preserving social networking software application for rapid temporal-
geographic surveillance of glycemic control.
Methods and Findings: SN-mediated collection of cross-sectional, member-reported data from an international online
diabetes SN entered into a software applicaction we made available in a ``Facebook-like'' environment to enable reporting,
charting and optional sharing of recent hemoglobin A1c values through a geographic display. Self-enrollment by 17%
(n = 1,136) of n = 6,500 active members representing 32 countries and 50 US states. Data were current with 83.1% of most
recent A1c values reported obtained within the past 90 days. Sharing was high with 81.4% of users permitting data
donation to the community display. 34.1% of users also displayed their A1cs on their SN profile page. Users selecting the
most permissive sharing options had a lower average A1c (6.8%) than users not sharing with the community (7.1%,
p = .038). 95% of users permitted re-contact. Unadjusted aggregate A1c reported by US users closely resembled aggregate
2007­2008 NHANES estimates (respectively, 6.9% and 6.9%, p = 0.85).
Conclusions: Success within an early adopter community demonstrates that online SNs may comprise efficient platforms for
bidirectional communication with and data acquisition from disease populations. Advancing this model for cohort and
translational science and for use as a complementary surveillance approach will require understanding of inherent selection
and publication (sharing) biases in the data and a technology model that supports autonomy, anonymity and privacy.

Introduction
Diabetes is a global health threat with an evolving disease
morphology whereby onset, burden and course are shifting in
concert with population-wide alterations in behavioral and lifestyle
factors and disease management strategies [1] [2,3]. Intensive
population-wide monitoring and longitudinal tracking of diabetes
are imperative for course correcting the disease and represent a
significant extension of current reporting practice and capacity.
We test a low-cost and scalable model of citizen science [4] for
diabetes research and surveillance by launching and promoting a
data-sharing software application into an established online
international community of people with diabetes. Unprecedented
uptake by consumers of online social networking (SN) through
social media websites like Facebook and MySpace represents an
opportunity to engage populations in citizen science health
research [5]. Our attempt is to assess the willingness of members
of social networks to participate, as a distributed population of
citizens--lay observers and patients--in public health reporting
about diabetes to augment clinical observation undertaken within
structured samples. We focus on a disease-specific online SN site.
This type of site provides a vehicle for communities with strong
impulses to advance health and may be an important untapped
resource for research: sites operate independently of formal health
care and information systems, serve as virtual support groups for
substantial numbers of patients and/or caregivers [6] [7] and,
while not intended as channels for specific programs to influence
knowledge, behavior or beliefs, nor for surveillance or research
they are evolving. For example, PatientsLikeMe, a network
created for patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [8], now
actively recruits members for patient-driven observational studies
and even biological sample collection.
We tested an SN-mediated approach to research sharing,
focusing on a very simple idea: that we could facilitate a ``data
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 4 | e19256
donation drive'' to enable community wide surveillance of
variation in a standard measure of glycemic control, the
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c or A1c). The A1c provides a
measures of the average blood glucose present over the past three
months, serving as a diagnostic marker of diabetes and is
associated prospectively with risk for diabetes complications [9]
[10]. Incremental reductions in A1c% have been associated with
reduced risk for diabetes related complications in rigorous
prospective research [11], underscoring the importance of careful
tracking of this indicator. For this purpose, we developed a
software application to allow members of an international online
diabetes SN site to report about and share disease information for
cohort and community research as part of their SN activity. We
examined reactivity of the sample to outreach efforts, uptake
patterns by country and state, patterns of data sharing and re-
contact permissions set by users and the associations among these
factors and health status--information vital to understanding
selection and reporting biases for this new approach. We also
undertook preliminary analyses of comparability of network-
sourced aggregate data with aggregate data from a structured
health reporting system and sample. We hypothesized high
willingness to participate and share information and a gradient
in information sharing among application users such that
participants selecting highly public sharing conditions would
report better diabetes health metrics than participants selecting
more private sharing conditions, at least initially. We also
hypothesized that despite the likely inherent selection bias
suggested by the medium and model, aggregate levels of glycemic
control reported by project participants would resemble aggregate
metrics obtained using a national structured reporting system and
sample. Our aim was to lay the groundwork for longitudinal study
using an engaged cohort of social network members and test the
feasibility of this model for rapid reporting of health metrics for
health research and as a source of personal and contextualized
feedback to the online community.
Methods
Test Site and Sample
The test site is www.TuDiabetes.org, an international online
diabetes social network. Founded in March, 2007, it is operated by
the not-for-profit Diabetes Hands Foundation. At the launch of
our project, TuDiabetes had 14,678 members. The majority of
website use is by members in the US (77% of website visits) but
also Canada (6%), the UK (4%), Australia (1%), and other
countries. In the US, California has the most visits (13%), followed
by New York (8%), Texas (7%), and Florida (5%). Persons ages 18
and over are eligible for membership; younger persons are
required to join with a parent/guardian. Membership comprises
primarily patients with a minority of members (approximately
15%) joining as significant others or friends of persons with
diabetes. The website contains news articles, blogs, and discussion
forums, and allows one to create an online profile to interact with
other members.
Network members are eligible to use the TuAnalyze application
if they meet membership criteria for TuDiabetes­are at least 18
years old, speak and read English, have internet access and are
affected by diabetes as a patient, family member or friend of
someone with diabetes. The network uses a team of volunteer
members to review membership applications and member
activities in an attempt to limit the presence in the community
of persons seeking to profit from engaging with the community in a
duplicitous or non-transparent fashion.
Software Application Overview
The TuDiabetes network is built on Ning, a software platform
for creating custom social networks. Ning implements the widely-
adopted OpenSocial standard for online social networks, hence
conferring generalizability to applications we develop for it. As do
Facebook and MySpace members, TuDiabetes members routinely
add software applications developed by third parties to their
profile. We developed and deployed a novel application
TuAnalyze, which enables members to report and share
biomedical data with the community under a consented model.
TuAnalyze is also a bidirectional communication link between the
online community and a research or public health team. The
application operates within the TuDiabetes website and is
platform-independent. TuAnalyze uses an innovative approach
to managing patient autonomy and confidentiality in that the
backend of the software application is a personally controlled
health record [12,13]. We leverage the INDIVO personally
controlled health record's fine grained, user-managed access
controls to enable consented sharing of data with the community,
research teams, or public health. Figure 1 provides a schematic of
the main activity flows of the application. When a user has agreed
to share their information a query/poll across the personal health
records returns consented results. An important feature of
TuAnalyze is biosurveillance-derived display of live, aggregate,
geo-referenced data back to the community for benchmarking at
country, province and/or state level. Geographic areas within the
map (e.g., a US state or Canadian province) illuminate with
descriptive displays once a sufficient sample of participants from
that area engages and shares data. Illumination of regions of the
map is tied to TuAnalyze participation: a critical mass of
TuDiabetes members is required to illuminate a region to protect
individual identity, incent ongoing engagement, and provide a
graphical and tabular data context against which engaged users
can compare themselves. There is growing evidence that patients
and consumers are interested in making such comparisons [8,14].
The displays are created from aggregated permissioned data
polled across personally controlled health records. They are
frequently refreshed creating a near real-time ``biosurveillance''
display of A1c levels. Individuals sharing data can view in
application graphs their A1c level plotted against the distribution
in their own state.
Information Sharing and Permission to Re-contact Users
for Research
Preferences for sharing information are flexible to accommodate
motivators of personal and collective benefit through affording
different uses and views of data. Three sharing settings are
supported among which there is a hierarchical relationship (see
Figure 2). As a condition of application use, all participants agree
to share data for research purposes under conditions of strict
identity protection (level one, the default setting). Users can also
opt to share their personal information with aggregate charts,
graphs and maps for display within the community where data are
anonymized and individual identity is protected (level two).
Finally, users can choose to share their information in the above
manner and on their network profile, to be visible according to the
privacy settings that govern that page (level three). In this least
restrictive condition, anyone a user permits to see their profile
page can see information entered in the application. Users can set
their preference for being re-contacted about future research
participation as part of the application interface. The default
setting is to permit re-contact and prompts users to confirm or
change this setting.

Sources of Data and Health Measurement (A1c)
Study data draw on three sources and sets of measures. The first
set of data is from the TuAnalyze application and includes self-
reports of most recent and past A1c values, user-set selections
governing research participation, privacy/sharing settings and re-
contact, and TuAnalyze metadata about application use (e.g.,
joining date, number of A1cs entered). The main health metric,
A1c, is an excellent summary statistic for personal and population
monitoring of diabetes including in self-reported form [15,16].
The application user interface supports A1c reporting on a
continuous scale, with associated data fields describing date
(month/year) of both A1c lab test and TuAnalyze data entry.
The second data category comprises metadata from the TuDia-
betes host site, specifically geography of membership for the
overall community including state location for US members,
obtained from an export of the member database provided by the
site administrator prior to implementing the application. Geo-
graphic location is requested upon creation of an account on
TuDiabetes and may be changed at any time; these data were
obtained as semi-structured user-entered information and were
then cleaned and integrated into the project database. The third
category of information comprises the most recent National
Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES) 2007­2008,
which includes laboratory and self-reported values for A1c among
a representative adult US sample. The 1024 NHANES A1c values
represent both self-report (n = 213) and lab results (n = 1003); for
Figure 1. Main activity flows of the TuAnalyze application. Individuals enter A1c data into the TuAnalyze application on TuDiabetes.org,
select sharing settings and consent to be re-contacted (A). Data flows into the Indivo PCHR (B) which provides secure backend, information storage
and patient-controlled sharing. All data entered into the application are captured in the research data set (C); an individual's sharing setting (D)
determines how and to whom their data is displayed on the TuDiabetes site (E).

those individuals with both values (n = 192), the average of the two
was used in comparisons. NHANES data were downloaded as a
publicly available file from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention website.
Sharing Toward a Citizen Science Model
The approach is guided by a model for engaging a distributed
population of observers in research activities through reporting,
sharing and contributing labor and computing time under a
collective enterprise organized around scientific discovery or gain.
The design builds on the intrinsic interest within online health-
related social networking sites to share information for personal or
collective benefit [17,18] and/or as an expression of ``information
altruism'' [19] [20]. The social network mediated model is distinct
from a more general sentinel surveillance model in which citizens
report about their health to a central authority using a web-
interface or survey, as is being done under the Gripenet project
centered on influenza [21]. The TuAnalyze cycle of data entry,
processing, sharing and contextualization are assumed to reinforce
ongoing engagement in a virtuous cycle of collaborative research.
The spirit of collective enterprise is further reinforced through:
N ``branding'' of the application in relation to the host social
network
N promotion and reinforcing activities of the host network and
restriction around use of the application and participation to
SN community members
N opportunity to self-identify within the community as a
participant in the project
N visualization of participants' contributed data, de-identified
and aggregated, within the community pool of data
N opportunity to contextualize personal information relative to
larger community aggregates.
The Data Donation Drive
Community engagement in the effort was pursued in May 2010
through publication on the site of multiple open broadcast
announcements to the community alerting them to the availability
on the site of the research application and overall project. These
initial promotional activities occurred during the first four weeks
and included publication by the site administrator of a news
article, banner text, forum posts and a blog entry about the
project, and email communication to the membership. Addition-
ally, the community newsletter featured an article about
TuAnalyze. Open promotion was followed in June 2010 with
more targeted outreach using Twitter to encourage continuing
community uptake and emails and direct messages to location-
based groups to encourage state level engagement sufficient to
light up various regions of map displays. The promotional
communications emphasized the voluntary nature of participation,
the strict controls over privacy and sharing, and used a non-
judgmental tone around sharing and levels of A1c to encourage a
broad range of community members to participate.
Analyses
The study period was the first three months of the application's
availability. Analyses consider all users given the international
membership of the host network and sub-analyses of US users, the
largest initial user group. For US only analyses, we examined state
level engagement in the application and tested for differences
between the national percentage of TuDiabetes members using
the application and each by-state average, testing for differences in
average A1c among participants from states whose uptake patterns
of the application are below, above and equivalent to the national
pattern. Also for US members, we estimated the average A1c and
compared that to the value estimated from the most recent
NHANES study (2007­2008). We used descriptive statistics to
characterize engagement with the application over time and by
geography, sharing settings and diabetes health metrics. The exact
binomial test was used to compare US state-level application use to
the mean. ANOVA was used to compare A1c across the three
groups of representative and non-representative states and the
three levels of sharing. Differences in A1c by location, research
contact settings, number of values entered, join period, currency of
value, and source (TuAnalyze or NHANES) were examined using
the two-sample t-test. Chi square tests were used to compare
application settings and use by location (US and non-US). All data
were analyzed using SAS version 9.2.
All study activities were reviewed and approved by the
Children's Hospital Boston Committee on Clinical Investigation
under a model of implied consent that was based on the pre-
existing norms for sharing in the community and in alignment
with the published privacy policy and terms of use of the site that
clearly inform the community about conditions for sharing data
and privacy protections.
Results
Initial uptake of the TuAnalyze application by nationality,
US state
In the initial study period, 1,136 members engaged with the
TuAnalyze application and 1,062 entered into it at least one A1c
value. The individuals using the application represent TuDiabetes
members from 32 countries and all 50 US states. Entered values
describe A1cs measured anywhere between 0 days to 7 years prior
to data entry. 83.1% of the most recent values entered by users
were ``current'', meaning reported values were obtained within 90
days of data entry. A substantial majority of application users
(89.7%) began using the application within 30 days of launch.
Engagement in this initial period aligns with outreach and
promotion activities to the TuDiabetes community (see Figure 3,
cumulative application uptake synced to promotion in the first 30
days).
Uptake of the TuAnalyze application is on a rolling basis
prospectively and estimating participation requires specification of
a denominator. Of 14,678 registered TuDiabetes members at
launch, 40­50% were considered to be ``active'' members based
on application to the total site membership of the logged traffic for
repeat site visits obtained using a web analytic system [22]. Thus
an unconstrained estimate of participation is 17% (n = 1,136 of an
estimated n = 6,500 active members). Alternatively, 11,019
members received a targeted newsletter promotion about the
application. Thus a constrained estimate of initial participation is
10% (n = 1,136 of n = 11,019 targeted mail recipients). The actual
participation level is likely to be somewhere between these two
estimated levels.
US members make up 90% of the TuAnalyze population;
Canada, Great Britain, and Australia represent the three largest
populations of non-US users (respectively, 3.5%, 1%, and 0.75%).
Of the US TuDiabetes population at launch (n = 10,223),
approximately 4,600 were considered to be active during the
initial launch period [22]. 21% (n = 959) are using TuAnalyze.
The proportion of US users picking up the application at the state
level was proportionate to this overall level in all but four states,
one of which was underrepresented and the other three were
Data Sharing in an Online Diabetes Social Network

overrepresented. Together, the membership in these four states
comprised 21% of the overall TuAnalyze US users.
Multiple A1c values were entered by 14.5% of all TuAnalyze
users (n = 154) upon first entering any data (n = 77) and/or in a
return visit to the application (n = 90). Of all users with multiple
values, 45% returned to the application to enter at least one
prospectively measured A1c (i.e., a value obtained after starting to
use the application). Non-US users were more likely than US users
to have entered multiple measurements (OR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.2­
3.2).
Sharing and Re-contact Settings
Overall, 81.4% of TuAnalyze users chose to include their data
in charts, graphs and maps describing the community with 34.1%
of the total also sharing their personal A1c data on their profile
page. The remaining 18.6% of users opted out of community
sharing entirely but agreed to have their data included in the
research data set. The distribution amongst the three privacy
options (Table 1) was comparable for US and foreign users
(p = 0.29). Despite the community map featuring only the United
States during the study period, the proportion of users inside and
outside of the US who opted to share their A1c data with the
community on the aggregate map was not significantly different
(p = 0.20). 95% of both the US and overall population have
permitted re-contact about further research studies.
Glycemic Control
Average A1c among users was 6. 9% (Table 1) and did not
differ between US and non-US TuAnalyze users (p = .69). The US
states with disproportionately high or low levels of uptake did not
differ from the rest of the states with respect to average A1c
(p = .23). In both the total sample and the US population, users
who entered multiple A1c values into the application had on
average a lower most recent A1c than those who had entered only
one. Very early adopters (i.e., those picking up the application
within the first two weeks following its launch) also had a lower
average A1c than did participants who picked up the application
later in its diffusion in both groups. Among very early adopters
there was no association between glycemic control and sharing/
privacy setting.
In the population as a whole, less restrictive privacy settings
were associated with better self-reported measures of glycemic
control. Users selecting the most permissive sharing option
(profile-display) had a lower average A1c (6.8%) than users with
the most restrictive setting (7.1%, p = .038). However, this
association was not robust (6.8% vs. 7.0% p = .058) among the
US sample which may indicate insufficient power.
Comparability
The average A1c for US TuAnalyze users (6.9%) was
comparable to the unadjusted average A1c of adults with a
diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes reported in the 2007­2008
NHANES (6.9%, p = 0.85). There were no differences between
aggregate TuAnalyze and aggregate NHANES data in subana-
lyses that considered NHANES modality (self-report, lab, or the
average of the two).
Discussion
It is well established that social networks transmit norms,
behaviors, information and pathogens that along with other
network properties, such as social support and social capital,
influence health [23,24,25,26]. Where reliable information about
ties and health outcomes or behaviors exists, novel and important
inferences about the patterning of disease in populations can be
made through social network analyses [27,28]. Where a
communication channel back to a source population persists,

our ambition of a rapid surveillance platform for ongoing
investigation and translation of findings to action may be achieved.
Toward that goal, we tested a model for engaging a distributed
population of lay persons and patients in reporting about diabetes
using a software application implemented for use by an online
international diabetes SN community.
We found high levels of participation and sharing of personal
health information for research use. There was substantial early
adoption of the application with participation by 10%­17% of the
overall community and 21% of the US community in the initial
study period. Uptake followed targeted outreach and promotion
suggesting that a rapid surveillance model run on the SN platform
can stimulate engagement and suggesting also the importance of
monitoring and directing promotional activity to foster diffusion
and sustained engagement. Extending the model to other public
health actions, such as alerting, surveying, polling around adverse
events to support post-market drug safety surveillance and
comparative effectiveness studies--all of which require engaged
samples and a nimble structure--may be feasible. Among
participants, the large majority (83%) of reported A1c measures
were current when reported, further supporting use of the
modality for rapid assessment of population health status. As
A1c is typically measured every three months, it remains to be seen
whether the data set remains current as it matures past the study
period. A minority of users provided a retrospective time series of
their A1c when they first used the application. The low prevalence
of this was not surprising given the application user interface
instructed users to enter their ``most recent A1c'' albeit the
application supports entry of a time series of measures. The values
for the most recent A1c reported by users who provided a time
series were lower on average than those reported by their peers
entering only one value. Compared to users reporting one value,
users entering a time series may be more vigilant, better organized,
or have better access to health information and testing resources.
Though differences in A1c between groups seem small, on a
population level these differences translate to substantial health
impacts.
Four fifths (83.1%) of users are actively choosing to share their
data with others in the community and switched from the default
sharing setting (research only) to either sharing data with
community charts or graphs or profile display. Thus, a strong
norm of sharing for research does not equal a blanket norm of
openness. This is consistent with prior findings of high willingness
to share personal health information for research conditioned by
perceptions of autonomy, anonymity, context and purpose [29].
Provision for user control over data sharing through the
application is a marked improvement over standard practice
among diabetes social networking sites wherein sites commonly
share member data and provide few if any user controls [6]. As
hypothesized, users selecting the most restrictive sharing settings
had on average worse self-reported measures of glycemic control
than users who selected more public/less restrictive settings. Thus,
data shared within the community may be slightly skewed toward
a better overall health metric. This may reflect myriad factors
including embarrassment, inhibition, or concern for adverse
consequences from disclosure, as found in prior research on
consumer-centered health information technologies [14]. Ability
to discern these biases is vital to successful use of this approach and
will help protect against validity threats to inferences made about
data from the community. Equally vital is learning how best to
engage populations in worse health that may not yet be
participating and that may require a greater understanding of
the approach and its privacy-preserving provisions.
In the US, differences in engagement with the application by
geography were few and not associated with health status. While
the majority of users are from the US, the model has captured an
international community and engagement may grow once country
or regional participation is sufficient to trigger international
illumination of mapping displays which provide incentive and
context.
Unadjusted aggregates of glycemic control in the community
were not different from unadjusted aggregates from the most
recent NHANES panel and this finding holds true for lab and self-
reported subsamples of NHANES data. Before inferences about
comparability are drawn, additional data that describe disease
type, course, history and demographics will need to be collected
and controlled in analyses. This will be possible as the application
matures to include a survey tool and other features. For this first
report, we note that the TuAnalyze model engaged an
equivalently sized sample in a highly accelerated time period
using a community-based approach that supports permissioned
recontact. This model enriched by additional demographic
information may comprise a rapid assessment complement to
traditionally structured research efforts.
The TuAnalyze software will allow integration of professionally-
sourced health system data in the near future through activation of
the personally controlled health record system platform on the
backend. This expansion, plus the integration of survey data into
the application interface, will afford opportunity to validate patient
entered information against health services data and enable a truly
comprehensive diabetes monitoring system with twinned lenses of
clinic and citizen-consumer.

Limitations
Promising early results should be viewed in the context of
limitations. The TuAnalyze population comprises consumers who
may be highly motivated to achieve good glycemic control and
whose degree of technological savvy and digital comfort may be
unrepresentative of the general population of persons with
diabetes. Participation biases limit our ability to generalize but
they enable this research and learning about them is vital to
advancing this model. Data on participation in a distributed
community with changing membership and participation are
necessarily limited by challenges in ascertaining a reliable
denominator that describes persons exposed to the site or active
during a given time period. Levels provided for this analysis are
bracketed by likely upper and lower bounds but are estimates:
reliable counts of registered members are available but not all
members were active during the study period or ``at risk'' of being
notified about a new application. Data are self-reported and
analyses do not yet adjust for demographics, diabetes type and
disease course factors. Collection of these data was not supported
under the initial application which prioritized a test of engagement
with the model and near real-time processing and return of A1c in
a model that supports contextualized reporting back to the
community. Future work will include a broader set of analyses on
demographically adjusted data, enabled by expanding the
TuAnalyze application to include a survey tool and other features.
The test site defines itself as a single community and we need to
study whether the findings generalize to other online communities,
including ones that may contain patients with other health
problems including diseases that may be highly socially stigma-
tized. Nevertheless, the site and sample represent considerable
international and geographic spread.
Conclusions
The participatory model employed in TuAnalyze is centered on
building a research relationship with an engaged cohort to foster
prospective study, ongoing communication and flexibility sufficient
to accommodate an evolving study protocol or measurement
model and diffusion and translation of findings. Our approach,
wherein data is sourced from a volunteer, consented cohort, is
distinct from data mining of web content where users have no
voice, control or opportunity for follow-up. It also differs from
registries of clinically tethered populations which provide few
opportunities for real-time patient input or expansion beyond
institutionally bound patient populations. Clinical registries
provide vital clinically observed metrics but they typically lack
patient-reported outcomes and generally do not provide registry
data back to patients; moreover, the timing and tempo of clinical
interviews and observations follow a research visit timeline as
opposed to the calendar of the patient and her experiences. The
TuAnalyze model, which provides for patient reporting and
aggregate feedback on a flexible time schedule could provide a
boon to public health and research and complement these other
approaches.
Leveraging the medium's power to sustain engagement and
foster consented reporting and communication may offset cost,
labor and processing demands associated with large sample
prospective data collection and ameliorate research challenges
related to: a) recruiting and maintaining study cohorts and
samples; b) moving beyond inflexible and single disease data
models that are difficult to modify or extend once in the field; c)
responding rapidly and at scale to emerging health phenomena or
findings; and, d) ``closing the loop'' between collection and analysis
of research data and translation or communication of findings to
source populations. No one model may be sufficient to address the
problem of diabetes but strategic use of a range of approaches may
help ``steer the ship'' as we address a global pandemic.
