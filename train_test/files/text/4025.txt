Introduction
Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is an important complica-
tion for patients with intrathoracic and extrathoracic malig-
nancies. In the United States, more than 175
000 people are
affected by MPE annually; the figure in the United Kingdom
is 40000. It is estimated that up to 50% of patients with meta-
static malignancy will develop a pleural effusion.1,2 The pres-
ence of an MPE portends a poor prognosis, with median

Abstract
Background. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common complication in most malignancies. Despite its frequent occurrence,
current knowledge of MPE remains limited and the effect of the management is still unsatisfying. Traditional Chinese medicine
(TCM) external treatment has unique advantages, such as quicker efficacy and fewer side effects. Objective. To observe the effects
and safety of Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment (TCM herbal ointment) in MPE. Design. This was a placebo-controlled double-blinded
randomized study. A total of 80 patients were enrolled, of which 72 were randomized to receive Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment or
placebo at an allocation ratio of 1:1. Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment or placebo was applied on the thorax wall for 8 hours daily. The
intervention lasted 2 weeks. Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment consisted of Astragalus membranaces , Semen pharbitidis 
, Cassia twig , Pericarpium arecae , Curcuma zedoary , Borneol ), and other substances.
In both groups, diuresis and drainages were used as needed. Outcomes covered the quantity of pleural effusion evaluation, TCM
Symptom Scale, Karnofsky Performance Scale, and safety indicators such as routine blood test, blood biochemistry test, and
response table of skin irritation. Results. Of 72 patients randomized to receive Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment or placebo along with
symptomatic treatment, the response rate was documented as 42.4% for the treatment group and 25.0% for the placebo group
(P = .138). As for the TCM symptom scale, the treatment group showed improvement in chest distress (P = .003), fullness and
distention (P = .042), shortness of breath (P < .001), no statistical significance in palpitation (P = .237), and pain (P = .063), whereas
the placebo group did not show statistical significance in any of the 5 symptoms. Major adverse events related to the treatment,
mainly skin irritation, were distributed equally. Conclusions. Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment showed a potential of reducing MPE, and
it could alleviate symptoms of dyspnea. Thus, it may be appropriate as a supplementary intervention for MPE. There were some
flaws in the study design. A larger scale and better designed trial is advocated.

survival ranging from 3 to 12 months.3 Furthermore, MPE
severely impairs patients' quality of life (QoL) and shortens
their survival.4 Physicians must always be clearly aware that
MPE usually indicates an incurable stage of cancer. Despite
great advances in cancer treatment in the past decades, man-
agement for MPE remains palliative. The usual treatment
options are (a) observation while awaiting treatment response
to underlying malignancy, (b) repeated thoracentesis, (c)
pleurodesis, (d) indwelling pleural catheter placement, and (e)
palliation of symptoms with opioids and oxygen in terminal
patients.1-5 The therapeutic goals of MPE treatment should not
only be fluid removal but also symptom relief (especially
from breathlessness), improvement in QoL, and maximizing
time outside of hospital.5 Because most procedures are con-
fined by limitations and complications, strategies for MPE
management should be made with deliberation.
External treatment is an important technique with a long
history and extensive application in broad disciplines in tradi-
tional Chinese medicine (TCM). It has been applied in MPE
and other complications of malignancies for several years.6-13
In the past decade, TCM external treatment has been success-
fully used in malignancy complications in our clinical practice.
Meanwhile, studies of external treatment for cancer complica-
tions showed promising outcomes.14-17 Some studies showed
that Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment, a TCM herbal ointment of
external treatment, had some effect on decreasing MPE.16,17
The aim of this study was to observe the effect of Kang'ai
Xiaoshui ointment on MPE, in the hope that it could provide
some higher level evidence for external treatment in MPE.
Methods
Design
This study was a multicenter, parallel, double-blinded, ran-
domized, placebo-controlled trial. It was aimed to observe
the safety and efficacy of Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment, a
TCM herbal ointment for external treatment on MPE.
Ethics
The trial was performed with the approval of the Ethics
Committee of China-Japan Friendship Hospital for Drug/
Instrument Clinical Researches (2013-36). All patients
signed an informed consent form before randomization and
treatment.
Participants
A total of 80 patients were enrolled, of which 72 were ran-
domized to receive Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment or placebo
in an allocation ratio of 1:1.
Eligible patients had to meet the following inclusion cri-
teria: (a) patients with malignant tumor confirmed by
pathology or cytology; (b) patients with pleural effusion
detected by sonogram or X-ray; (c) cancer cells can be
found from subjects' pleural effusion sample or subjects
diagnosed with pleural metastasis; (d) no history of intra-
peritoneal chemotherapy and/or intraperitoneal immuno-
therapy within 3 weeks; (e) no severe dysfunction of heart,
liver, or kidney; (f) age 18 to 80 years; (g) patients are able
to participate in study procedures and QoL evaluations; and
(h) patients understand and agree to receive the treatment,
and sign information consent form.
Exclusion criteria were the following: (a) patients with
skin ulceration or severe hypersusceptibility and (b) patients
undergoing radiotherapy/chemotherapy or had radiother-
apy/chemotherapy within 1 month.
The subjects were enrolled from 1 of the following 3
centers: China-Japan Friendship Hospital (Center 1),
Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Third Affiliated
Hospital (Center 2), and Beijing Hospital of Traditional
Chinese Medicine (Center 3).
Outcomes and Response Assessment
Primary outcome was the quantity of pleural effusion evalua-
tion, which was assessed by imagological examination (sono-
gram or X-ray).18,19 The other primary outcome was TCM
Symptom Scale20 (Supplementary Table 1, available online at
http://ict.sagepub.com/}supplemental). Secondary outcomes
were drainage quantity of pleural effusion/body surface and
Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS). There were safety indi-
cators such as routine blood tests, blood biochemistry test, and
response table of skin irritation. All indicators were evaluated
before enrollment and weekly after randomization.According
to maximum of effusion depth, our rating scale defined depth
less than 5 cm as Small, 5 cm to 10 cm as Moderate, more
than 10 cm as Large. Complete response (CR) was defined as
plural effusion having disappeared and symptoms relieved
completely. Partial response (PR) was defined as plural effu-
sion having decreased more than 1 grade and symptoms
apparently relieved. No change (NC) was defined as no plural
effusion decrease and no relief of symptoms. Response was
defined as CR + PR.
Intervention
Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment or placebo 10 g was applied on the
lateral thorax wall of the effusion side and covered with dress-
ing for 8 hours daily. In both groups, diuresis and drainage
were used as needed.The intervention lasted 2 weeks. Kang'ai
Xiaoshui ointment is a hospital preparation of China-Japan
Friendship Hospital. The formula consisted of Astragalus
membranaces , Semen pharbitidis ,
Cassia twig , Pericarpium arecae ,
Curcuma zedoary , Borneol ), and other
substances. The placebo composition was starch and pigmen-
tum. It was prepared by the Pharmaceutical Department of
China-Japan Friendship Hospital, as was the placebo. The
Feize et al 475
ointment and placebo were packed in sealed identical bottles
that contained a supply for about 1 week. The patients were
randomized to begin therapy after the enrollment and baseline
assessment and after signing the consent form.
Randomization and Blinding
Randomization was used to allocate patients 1:1 to each treat-
ment arm. It was stratified with centers, and with block size of
6. Randomization was made with SAS 9.1.3. Labels with con-
tinuous code, which represented randomization and interven-
tion arms, were pasted on the corresponding bottles. Every
code had 3 copies of the label pasted on the corresponding
bottles. The randomization and codes were kept by an inde-
pendent personnel blinded to the patients and researchers.
Sample Size Considerations
The sample size calculations were based on the results of
previous studies. We assumed that the effect rate of Kang'ai
Xiaoshui ointment was 60%, while that of placebo was
25%.17 For 80% power with  set at .05, we would need 29
participants in each arm. Considering 20% as the noncom-
pletion rate, the sample size was 35 for each arm.
Statistical Analysis
We used 2-sample t tests or the Wilcoxon test for continuous
variables and 2 or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.All tests
were with a .05 significance level. Statistical analyses were
done using SAS software version 9.1.3. A third party
(Guoxinzeding International Medical Technology Co,
Beijing, China) did the statistical analysis independently.
Results
A total of 72 patients with malignancies were randomized.
Thirty-seven patients were male. The mean age of the patients
was 64.3 (range 40-79) years. The mean disease course was
716.0 days, and the median was 481.0 days. The patients in the
2 groups were well matched for baseline characteristics (Table
1). All patients stayed in the same group as assigned. Of these,
65 were eligible for analysis, 33 of the treatment group and 32
of the placebo group, as shown in the flow diagram in Figure 1.
Of the 7 cases of noncompletion, 4 were lost to follow-up. Two
ceased due to adverse events, and 1 patient declined the inter-
vention and requested chemotherapy (Supplementary Table 2,
available online at http://ict.sagepub.com/supplemental).
Treatment Outcomes
Of the 72 patients randomized to receive TCM herbal ointment
or placebo along with supportive treatment, 65 were eligible
for analysis. Twenty-two were reported as PR, 43 were NC,
with no CR was reported. The response rate was documented
as 42.4% (14/33) in patients receiving TCM herbal ointment
and 25.0% (8/32) in those receiving placebo. There was a trend
that the treatment group was more effective than the placebo

group, but no statistical significance was shown (P = .138;
Table 2). However, in relieving symptoms of chest distress,
fullness and distention, and shortness of breath, the treatment
group showed statistical significance, while the placebo group
showed no significant differences in any of the 5 symptoms.
Symptoms of heart palpitation and pain in the treatment group
showed no statistical significance (Table 3). No thoracentesis/
drainage was conducted throughout the treatment. In the treat-
ment group, mean KPS was 69.4 and the median was 70 at
baseline. In the last interview, the mean KPS was 71.9 and the
median was 70. There was no statistical significance of KPS
within the treatment group (P = .277). In placebo group, the
mean was 65.3 versus 67.1, and the median was 67.5 versus
70. There was no statistical significance (P = .599).

Adverse Events
During the intervention, 24 adverse events (AEs) were
recorded. There was no severeAE. The comparison ofAEs in
the 2 groups had no statistical significance (12 vs 12, P =
.723). Of all AEs, 9 were considered as related or possibly
related to intervention (4 in the treatment group, 5 in the pla-
cebo group), most of which were skin irritation or allergy.
Two cases led to ceasing the intervention, while the other 7
were merely mild skin reactions. The incidence of interven-
tion related AEs was 12.5% (11.1% vs 13.8%).
Blood routine and biochemical tests showed no statisti-
cally significant differences in both groups.
Discussion
Malignant pleural effusion, as a common complication for
malignancies, portends a poor prognosis and affects
patients' QoL.3,4 The therapeutic goals of MPE treatment
should take fluid removal and symptom relief into account.
Despite great advances in cancer treatment, management
for MPE remains palliative.1-5
Restricted by complications and some other factors, the
management for MPE remains intractable.
This randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-
controlled study was performed to investigate the efficacy
of Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment, a TCM herbal ointment for
external treatment, in dealing with MPE. It was planned to
provide some high level of evidence. However, the effect on
effusion volume showed no statistical significance between
the treatment group and the placebo group, which was not
in accordance with the results of previous studies.16,17 After
we reviewed the design and process, we found some flaws
in the study that might lead to a negative outcome. However,
we still consider this study as a meaningful one. So we will
pay some attention to discussing those flaws in hopes of
helping formulate a better design.
The response rate was documented as 42.4% in the treat-
ment group versus 25.0% in the placebo group, which showed
no statistical significance (P = .138). Most probably, this lack
of statistical significance is caused by a too small sample size
(36 for each arm), as we were overly optimistic in evaluating
the effect of the ointment observed in a pilot trial17 for sample
size calculation. If we take the data of this study to recalculate
sample size, the result will be as follows: set  = 0.05, 1 -  =
0.8, efficiency: 42.4% versus 25.0%, N1 = N2 = 112. If  =
0.05, n1 = n2 = 36, efficiency: 42.4% vs 25.0%, 1 -  = 0.357.
Fortunately, there was no thoracentesis and drainage
during the study. In this study, thoracentesis or drainage
would be a confounding factor that severely influenced the
response, but it was allowed by the protocol, which was a
flaw in the study design. To eliminate the confounding, sub-
jects who need thoracentesis or drainage should be excluded.

The protocol allowed using either X-ray or sonogram to
evaluate the effusion amount. However, there was no con-
sensus on pleural effusion grading of sonograms. Based on
clinical experience and feasibility, a grading criterion was
discussed and agreed through a Delphi method by the chiefs
of Ultrasonography Departments of all enrollment centers.
According to maximum of effusion depth, the grading crite-
rion defined depth less than 5 cm as Small, 5 cm to 10 cm as
Moderate, and more than 10 cm as Large.
In this study, the results of evaluation such as CR, PR, or
NC were based on the grading criterion mentioned above.
This criterion was different from the criterion that is usually
used in other studies, and had not been validated. Moreover,
the observation period in this study was 14 days, shorter than
other studies. Therefore, effect of a longer treatment period
remains to be seen. Furthermore, since the treatment goal for
MPE includes improvement in QoL and maximizing time
outside of hospital, it seems to be more valuable for a future
study to observe the duration of effusion decrease, times and
drainage or thoracentesis in a certain span of time.
As TCM naturally concerns patients'subjective feelings, we
designed the TCM Symptom Scale. However, the validity of
the scale might be weakened. For example, chest distress, full-
ness and distention, and shortness of breath are 3 TCM symp-
toms that describe dyspnea from different aspects. They may
help TCM doctors with syndrome differentiation and treatment
decision. As there was no TCM syndrome differentiation
involved, the 3 symptoms could be replaced by dyspnea.
Otherwise, patients would be confused. We intended to observe
palpitation and pain that was caused by effusion, but confound-
ing of heart disease and cancer pain could not be ruled out.
In consideration of this add-on study design, it would be
better to record the disease condition of cancer, which might
help identify confounding caused by cancer remission.
Conclusion
Kang'ai Xiaoshui ointment showed a potential for reducing
MPE and could alleviate symptoms of dyspnea. Thus, it
may be appropriate as a supplementary intervention for
MPE. There were some flaws in the study design. A larger
scale and better designed trial is advocated.
