Abstract
Objective: This investigation evaluated the real-time point-of-care testing (RT-POCT) of
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) for detecting acute kidney injury (AKI) and
prognosis of critically ill patients.
Methods: A total of 249 critically ill patients in the emergency department (ED), who were
diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure, sepsis or diabetic ketoacidosis were enrolled in
this study. All enrolled patients were followed up for 28 days or to death and the mortalities were
recorded. Serum creatinine (sCr) and NGAL were measured.
Results: 40.6% enrolled patients deteriorated to AKI during the observation period. The NGAL
level was significantly higher in the AKI versus non-AKI group. The NGAL levels in the non-
survivors group at 7-day and 28-day were significantly higher than in the survivors group.
NGAL was detected as an independent risk factor of AKI, and 7-day and 28-day morality.
The receiver operating characteristic curve of NGAL was calculated for diagnosing AKI; the area
under the curve (AUC) was significantly higher than that of 1-day eGFR.
Conclusions: NGAL is an independent predictor of AKI, and 7-day and 28-day mortality in
critically ill ED patients, and can be an early alert for AKI and useful for determining prognosis.

Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as a
sudden loss of renal function. AKI is a
major clinical issue in critically ill patients,
with persistently high rates of hospital re-
admission and mortality carrying a substan-
tial economic burden.1 Delay in diagnosis
and treatment of AKI will result in either
deterioration of renal function, or perman-
ent renal impairment leading to dialysis.2
Many critically ill patients with normal
kidney function may progress to AKI
during the course of treatment in the emer-
gency department (ED). Especially those
with sepsis, acute decompensated heart fail-
ure (ADHF) and diabetic ketoacidosis
(DKA), which may influence the perfusion
of the kidney significantly. Therefore, early
detection of AKI has become very import-
ant in diagnosis and prognosis in critically ill
patients.3
It has been proven that neutrophil gela-
tinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a
strong biomarker for early detection of
AKI in various clinical settings.4­6 NGAL
increases as early as 2 hours after injury to
the kidney. It appears to be a novel `real-
time' biomarker of AKI, which can predict
AKI several days earlier than serum creatin-
ine (sCr). Real-time point-of-care testing
(RT-POCT) is defined as medical testing
performed at the site of patient care, and has
been used widely in intensive care units
and EDs. Since the ED is the first site of
contact for most critically ill patients, the
use of RT-POCT can not only accelerate
triage, but also facilitate evidence-based
practices in the ED.7
Clinical studies have confirmed the diag-
nostic and prognostic value of NGAL in
various settings,6,8 but few of them used
the RT-POCT NGAL in critically ill
patients in the ED for evaluating its efficacy.
In this study, we reported our experience of
RT-POCT NGAL for detecting AKI in
critically ill patients of an urban university
tertiary hospital ED.
Methods
Population
Between April 2014 and September 2014,
critically ill patients in the ED who were
diagnosed with ADHF, sepsis or DKA
within 12 hours of admission to the ED,
were enrolled in this study. ADHF was
defined as the rapid onset or change of
symptoms and signs of heart failure.9 Sepsis
was defined according to the Surviving
Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines
for management of severe sepsis and septic
shock, 2012.10 DKA was defined as hyper-
glycemia (blood glucose >11 mmol/L or
200 mg/dl), venous pH < 7.3 or bicarbonate
<15 mmol/L, and the presence of keto-
nemia or ketonuria.11
The exclusion criteria were: age <18 years
old; pregnancy; previously diagnosed
abnormal renal function; autoimmune dis-
eases; terminal cancer; known urinary tract
infection; known exposure to nephrotoxic
agents during treatment in the ED, which
included aminoglycoside, angiotensin-con-
verting enzyme inhibitors, contrast agent
et al; treatment time in hospital <3 days
(not including died within 3 days); and
patients (or their relatives) who declined
to participate. The enrolled patients were
followed up for 28 days or until death.
A flow diagram of patient enrollment is
shown in Figure 1.

Study design
The protocols were approved by the ethics
committee of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital,
Capital Medical University. The study was
conducted in the ED of Beijing Chao-Yang
Hospital, Capital Medical University, which
is an urban university tertiary hospital with
approximately 250,000 ED admissions every
year. Subject data, name, age, sex, past
medical history, vital signs, and Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
(APACHE) II score12 were recorded imme-
diately after enrollment. Within 60 min of
arrival in the ED, and as soon as possible, a
blood sample was collected from patients for
routine laboratory examinations including
sCr and RT-POCT NGAL. Treatment for
all enrolled patients was based on the rou-
tine standard of care and was entirely inde-
pendent of the study. All patients were
followed up for 28 days and then the prog-
nosis was recorded. If a patient was
discharged within 3 days, all data about
them were excluded from the research,
because no definite prognosis was required.
The estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) was calculated by the Cockcroft-
Gault equation and adjusted for body sur-
face area per 1.73 m2.13 AKI is defined as
any of the following (not graded): A increase
in sCr by Â0.3 mg/dl (Â26.5 mmol/L) within
48 hours; B increase in sCr to Â1.5 times
baseline, which is known or presumed to
have occurred within the prior 7 days; C urine
volume <0.5ml/kg/h for 6 hours. The classi-
fication of AKI was according to the Kidney
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes
(KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines.14
Laboratory tests
sCr was tested by the ADVIAÕ 2400 chem-
istry system (Siemens, Germany) using an
enzymatic method in the hospital lab
straight after blood samples were drawn.
Figure 1. Diagram of enrollment 313 patients were registered when they were admitted to the ED, and
64 were excluded according to the exclusion criteria. Thus, 249 patients were enrolled in this investigation.

RT-POCT NGAL results were obtained
using the AlereTM TriageÕ Meterpro Device
(Alere San Diego, Inc., San Diego, CA,
USA) with an immunofluorescence kit
within 15­20 min. The kit contains an
NGAL-specific monoclonal antibody con-
jugated to a fluorescent nanoparticle and
integrated control features including posi-
tive and negative control immunoassays,
which ensure that the test performs cor-
rectly. 200 l whole blood was dropped on
the sample port where cells were separated
from plasma through an integrated filter.
The antibody-conjugated fluorescent detec-
tion nanoparticles flow down to the diag-
nostic lane via capillary action. Both
monomeric and dimeric forms of NGAL in
the samples will prevent binding of the
fluorescent detection particles to the solid
phase. The serum NGAL concentration is
inversely proportional to the fluorescence
detected. A control zone is located in the
same kit. Calibration information is relayed
to the device via a code chip module. To
decrease bias, the tests were performed by
two designated experimenters.
Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using SPSS 19.0
software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Categorical data were presented as frequen-
cies and percentages. All continuous vari-
ables were skewed distributions and are
presented as the inter-quartile range
(IQR) (25th percentile to 75th percentile).
Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-
Wallis H tests were conducted to detect the
differences among the different groups.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves and the area under the curve (AUC)
were calculated to detect the differences
among the indexes for predicting AKI and
the 28-day mortality. Based on the optimal
thresholds, which were detected by the
ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value (PPV) and negative
predictive value (NPV), were then calcu-
lated. A Z-test was used for comparing
AUCs between the different curves. Binary
logistic regressions were applied for deter-
mining the risk factors of 28-day mortality
and AKI. Multinomial logistic regression
was used to determine the predictive effects
of NGAL on KDIGO. Curve estimate was
performed for establishing the regression
equation between the eGFR and NGAL. All
statistical tests were two-tailed, and P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
The general characteristics of patients in
the different diagnosis groups
A total of 313 patients were registered when
they were admitted to the ED, and 64 were
excluded according to the exclusion criteria.
Therefore, a total of 249 patients were
enrolled in this investigation. General char-
acteristics of patients in the different diag-
nosis groups are summarized in Table 1. No
significant difference in sex was found
between the different groups (ADHF,
sepsis, DKA) at admission, whereas a sig-
nificant difference in age between the ADHF
and DKA groups was found (P ¼ 0.032).
Both 1-day sCr and 1-day eGFR were
normal, and while significant differences
were found between them among the differ-
ent groups, these differences disappeared
after the 3rd day of admission. The median
value of NGAL and APACHE II score at
admission was 119 [IQR 79­264] ng/ml and
14 [IQR 11­18] respectively. 40.6% of the
enrolled patients deteriorated to AKI during
the observation period. The 7-day and
28-day mortality rate was 9.6% and 29.7%
respectively. Significant differences in
NGAL were found among the three groups
(P < 0.01), due to the higher level of NGAL
in the sepsis and DKA groups.

The general characteristics of patients in
different KDIGO classifications
The general characteristics of patients in
different KDIGO classifications are sum-
marized in Table 2. There were no signifi-
cant differences in age in the different
KDIGO classifications, while significant dif-
ferences in sex, the NGAL level, APACHE
II score and mortality among the different
KDIGO classifications were found. The
percentage of males and the NGAL level
were significantly higher in the patients
with AKI than without AKI (P < 0.05).
Moreover, the more severe the KDIGO
classification, the higher the NGAL level
was. This was not surprising that very
significant differences in sCr and eGFR
were found among the different KIDGO
classifications, because they are determined
by sCr level. The 7-day and 28-day mortality
increased with the severity of KDIGO clas-
sification, to a maximum of 42.9% and
64.3% respectively in KDIGO 3.
NGAL levels in the different groups of
patients
When the patients were admitted to the ED,
the NGAL levels were higher in the AKI
group than in the non-AKI group
(Z ¼ À11.343, P < 0.001, Figure 2(a)). It
was also significantly higher in the sepsis
group when compared with the ADHF
group (Z ¼ À3.267, P ¼ 0.001). In the sepsis
group, the NGAL levels of non -AKI and
AKI patients were 113 [IQR 77­235] ng/ml
and 406 [IQR 147­1250] ng/ml respectively,
and a significant difference was found
between the two groups (Z ¼ À4.206,
P < 0.001). The NGAL levels in the non-
survivors group at 7-days (Z ¼ À6.173,
P < 0.001, Figure 2(b)) and at 28-days
(Z ¼ À5.562, P < 0.001, Figure 2(c)) was
significantly higher than it was in the sur-
vivors group.
Risk factors for mortality and AKI
Age, sex, NGAL level, 1-day eGFR and
APACHE II were analyzed by binary logis-
tic regression, and only sex and NGAL were
confirmed as risk factors for AKI (Table 3).
Multinomial logistic regression analysis was
performed for KDIGO classification with
the same variables as binary logistic regres-
sion. The result indicated that high NGAL
levels were correlated with high KDIGO
classification (Table 4). The increase in
serum NGAL was also detected as an inde-
pendent risk factor for high mortality at
7-day and 28-day by binary logistic regres-
sion (Table 5).
Regression analysis of NGAL levels
and eGFR
An inverse equation was established
between NGAL and 3-day eGFR by curve
regression (R2 ¼ 0.775, F ¼ 93.655,
P < 0.001) (Figure 3). The equation was:
3 À day eGFR ¼ 43:461 þ 2171:012=NGAL
The diagnostic power of NGAL, eGFR and
APACHE II score for AKI and mortality
The ROC curve of NGAL was calculated
for diagnosing AKI, the AUC of which was
0.923. This was higher than that of 1-day
eGFR (AUC ¼ 0.534, Z ¼ 9.435, P < 0.01).
Similar results were found in predicting
7-day and 28-day mortality by NGAL, the
AUC of which were 0.883 and 0.723 respect-
ively. Notably, NGAL was the highest of all
indexes. The AUC of NGAL combined with
the APACHE II score was 0.718 for pre-
dicting 28-day mortality; thus, no extra
benefit was found compared with NGAL
alone (AUC ¼ 0.723, Z ¼ 0.102, P > 0.05).
However, an improved result was gained for
predicting 7-day mortality when combined

was better than NGAL alone (AUC ¼
0.883, Z ¼ 13.620, P < 0.01) (Table 6 and

respectively.
Discussion
It is well known that hypoperfusion, espe-
cially of the non-crucial organs (including
kidneys), is one of the key factors for AKI
progressing, which is common in critically ill
patients. It was reported by the latest
meta-analysis that 1 in 5 adults (21.6%) and
1 in 3 children (33.7%) experienced AKI
worldwide using the KDIGO definition.15
AKI is increasingly observed in critical care
settings; meanwhile, critically ill patients with
normal renal function can progress quickly to
severe AKI. It is crucial to identify those
high-risk patients from others for targeted
interventions. So far, the golden criteria of
diagnosis and classification of AKI is Cr and
urine output. However, the defects and the
unreliability of Cr and urine output for
monitoring renal function in the critically ill
and in the acute setting are well known.16 Cr
also lacks the sensitivity to detect minor
changes in renal function.
Figure 3. Curve estimate of NGAL and eGFR An inverse equation of 3-day
eGFR ¼ 43.461 þ 2171.012/NGAL was established between NGAL and 3-day eGFR by curve regression
analysis.
eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate; NGAL: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin.
Hang et al. 1239
In our study, eGFR was derived from sCr
by the Cockcroft-Gault equation. There are
more accurate methods for estimating
eGFR, such as the Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, but that
was built from the chronic kidney disease
(CKD) population.17 It is well known that
the relationship between eGFR and Cr is
not the same in CKD and healthy subjects.18
Indeed, the MDRD formula may underesti-
mate the true eGFR in healthy subjects,
especially when its value is !60 ml/min/
1.73 m2.19,20 Since most of our patients,
especially in the DKA group, had normal
kidney function when they were enrolled, we
used the Cockcroft-Gault equation, which
correlated with the MDRD equation and is
more accurate in normal kidneys.

NGAL is a ubiquitous protein of
178 amino acids with a molecular mass of
approximately 25kDa and is composed of 8
beta sheets that form a shaped structure.21 In
an induced kidney injury experiment, Paragas
et al.22 found that the timing and the intensity
of NGAL mRNA and protein were corre-
lated and dependent on the degree of kidney
damage. POCT NGAL measurement aided
the assessment of renal function during acute
burn resuscitation in an ICU, but in this
investigation, only 15 patients were
involved.23 A similar result was found in
our previous experiments in a porcine model
of cardiac arrest for predicting renal func-
tion24; there was a positive correlation
between the grade of renal injury and serum
NGAL level.25 Thus, detection of early renal
injury is possible by NGAL levels even when
sCr levels are normal.
ADHF, sepsis and DKA are the most
common critical diseases in the ED, which
can decrease renal perfusion significantly.
Therefore, it was not a surprise that AKI
was found in these patients after a period of
normal renal function. That was why we
used them to investigate AKI in non-
preexisting renal disease patients. Our pre-
vious investigation already confirmed that
NGAL was higher in the septic patients with
AKI than those without AKI.5 In this
investigation, we shifted the testing time of
NGAL as early as we could, and used the
fastest RT-POCT technology. We tried to
confirm the predictive value of NGAL in
critically ill patients with normal sCr. In our
study, elevated NGAL levels with the deteri-
oration of renal function during hospital
stay were observed. The incidence of AKI
was 40.6% in all enrolled patients, and was
34.7%, 50.6% and 44.0% of ADHF, sepsis
and DKA patients respectively. This sug-
gests that the presence of underlying acute
tubular injury, detected by elevated NGAL
level, may be directly associated with devel-
opment of AKI. Logistic regression also
confirmed that the increase of NGAL level
was an independent risk factor for the
KDIGO classification, and 7-day and
28-day mortality.
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is always accom-
panied by the potential decline of kidney
function with time, although the Cr could be
normal. The relatively low reserved renal
function may be an issue when patients
with DM undergo physiological stress.
Moreover, when patients with DM devel-
oped DKA, there was always more severe
tissue hypoperfusion than in HF and sepsis
because of the dehydration. Therefore, it is
not surprising that the percentage of
KDIGO 3 patients was the highest in the
DKA group compared with the other two
groups. Furthermore, we have evaluated the
power of NGAL in prognosis. The results
show that the NGAL combined with the
APACHE II score was not any more bene-
ficial than NGAL alone for predicting 28-
day mortality. However, this was different
when combining them for predicting 7-day
mortality, which was better than using
NGAL only. That may be because the
APACHE II score emphasized the acute
physiological condition of a patient with
relative normal renal function, so it could
not evaluate the future prognosis. However,
NGAL can do what the APACHE II score
cannot do, which may demonstrate that it is
a sensitive marker for evaluating the severity
of early AKI and further prognosis. In our
investigation, when sCr or eGFR were
still normal, NGAL was already abnormal.
Notably, eGFR would not decrease until
3 days later. Furthermore, an inverse regres-
sion was found between the NGAL and
3-day eGFR, which also supported that
there might be a relationship between
NGAL and renal function, although this
relationship may not be a simple linear one.
Historically, emergency physicians have
been caught between the proverbial rock
and a hard place when evaluating critically
ill patients. Our choices were limited to using
rapid but analytically imprecise assays or
Hang et al. 1241
more accurate but significantly slower
laboratory platforms. Although it is cur-
rently agreed that the time delay of the
slower tests is ``just an hour or so differ-
ence'',7 the risk of patient morbidity and
mortality increases with more time spent in
the ED.26 Similarly, the earlier the recogni-
tion of AKI, the better the kidney function
may recover. It is important to recognize
that the timing of biomarker measurement
has a significant impact on the ability of
NGAL to predict the development of AKI,
since NGAL was also time dependent.
Currently, NGAL can be measured in
whole blood, serum, plasma, and urine by
several commercially available analytical
immunoassays. However, most of the meas-
urements take a relatively long time (at least
2 hours), which may increase the emergency
physicians' therapeutic turnaround time and
ultimately extend the time of stay in the
ED. In this study, we used the RT-POCT
NGAL, which was conducted beside the
patient in less than half an hour. So far,
there are few studies investigating the
RT-POCT NGAL in clinical use, especially
in the ED. Currently, critically ill patients
arrive at the ED, a quick evaluation is done
and NGAL is tested as soon as the blood
sample is taken. On average, the time it takes
for the NGAL test results to return from
the time of the patients' arrival was thirty
minutes. This was much faster than the central
laboratory. Thus, ownership of the RT-POCT
NGAL can facilitate ED physicians' ability to
confirm a diagnosis of AKI and reduce their
therapeutic turnaround time.
Limitations
This was a single-center study and the
number of enrolled patients was only 249.
In this study, we did not compare other
severity score systems and biomarkers.
The NGAL level was measured only once
and its dynamic changes over time were not
observed. In contrast, infection can influence
the NGAL level in serum,27 which may bias
our results. However, a significant difference
of serum NGAL could be found between
patients with or without AKI in the sepsis
group, so it may not influence the conclusions
of our investigation.
Conclusions
NGAL is an independent predictor of AKI,
and 7-day and 28-day mortality in critically
ill patients in the ED. POCT NGAL can
alert to AKI early and provide a prognosis
in critically ill patients.
