ABSTRACT
Objective: To examine the association between socioeconomic status (SES), self-rated health (SRH), and mortality
separately by race-ethnicity in a nationally representative sample of US adults.
Methods: We analyzed data from 16 716 adult women and men who were followed up for mortality for up to 12
years as part of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination survey (NHANES III). Poverty-income ratio
(PIR) and education were assessed as measures of SES. All-cause mortality (n = 2850) was recorded from the
NHANES III linked mortality file.
Results: Lower PIR was associated with mortality after adjustment for lifestyle, clinical risk factors, and SRH in all
racial-ethnic groups (P-trend <0.005). In contrast, after adjusting for lifestyle and clinical risk factors, lower
education was not associated with all-cause mortality in non-Hispanic whites (P-trend = 0.16), whereas the
association remained significant after adjustment for SRH and lifestyle and clinical risk factors in other race-
ethnicities (P-trend = 0.005; P-interaction between education categories and race-ethnicity was 0.02).
Conclusions: Our results suggest that lower PIR was associated with mortality in all racial-ethnic groups. In
contrast, lower education was significantly associated with mortality only in racial-ethnic groups other than non-
Hispanic whites. Our results indicate that, beyond lifestyle and clinical risk factors, adjusting for SRH resulted in only
a modest change in the association of SES and mortality.

INTRODUCTION
The effect of socioeconomic disparities on health outcomes
is a public health concern. Major socioeconomic variables
include income, education, occupation, and insurance status,
all of which may dictate differential access and control of
material and social resources in a society. Of particular interest
is the manner in which other global inequalities, such as ethnic
and sex inequalities, interact with socioeconomic inequalities
to modify associations with health. Although ethnic and sex
disparities in health have been observed and extensively
studied,1­5 a side-by-side comparison of race-ethnicity, sex,
and socioeconomic disparities would likely better illuminate
the particular effects on specific segments of a population,
which is crucial for targeted public health decision-making.
An understanding of the pathways and mechanisms through
which health is affected is of value to public health. To
date, research suggests that individual health behaviors (eg,
smoking) and clinically diagnosed health status (eg, high
blood pressure)6 are variables that might partially explain the
observed social gradient in health, as these variables also
demonstrate a similar socioeconomic gradient.7­9 However, it
is possible that subjective factors such as psychosocial and
emotional components of health are also determinants of the
social gradient in health.10,11
Global self-rating of health has been widely advanced as
a reliable predictor of mortality in several studies.12,13 As
opposed to conventional objective assessments, self-rated
health (SRH) considers a more holistic approach to health
assessment by accounting for physical, social, and emotional
influences on health.12­15 Socioeconomic differentials have
been established in SRH16­18: self-rated health in lower
socioeconomic groups is generally worse than that in higher
socioeconomic groups, and several studies have also
demonstrated SRH variations across sex and ethnicities.12,13
However, little research has evaluated the role of SRH in
explaining socioeconomic differentials in mortality. A study
conducted in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort concluded that SRH

does not explain socioeconomic differentials in mortality
beyond those already explained by clinical and lifestyle-
related factors in the European cohort.19 However, that study
did not conduct any subgroup analyses (eg, by race-ethnicity)
and examined only occupation status as a socioeconomic
variable. It has been suggested that income may be a better
socioeconomic status (SES) variable of health than occupation
status.20 Furthermore, no studies have examined this relation
in US cohorts. In this context, we examined the association
between SES and all-cause mortality after adjustment for
SRH, in addition to behavioral and clinical factors, in a
large, nationally representative sample of US adults. We also
performed stratified analyses by race-ethnicity to examine if
there are racial differences in the observed associations.
METHODS
Study participants
The third National Health and Nutrition Examination survey
(NHANES III) collected data on a nationwide probability
sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized US population.
Standardized questionnaires were administered at home,
followed by detailed physical examinations at a mobile
examination center. Detailed descriptions of the complex
survey design, interviewing procedures, and physical
examinations conducted have been published before and are
available online.21 In brief, NHANES III uses a stratified
multistage probability sample of households, with over-
sampling of Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks to
ensure adequate sample size for analysis. The study protocol
was approved by the institutional review board of the National
Center for Health Statistics of the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
Of the 18 825 participants aged 20 years or older who
participated in the interview and examination components of
NHANES III, mortality assessment data were available for
18 800 participants. We excluded those with missing data on
poverty-income ratio (PIR, n = 1978), education status (n =
96), and certain other variables included in the multivariable
model (n = 10), leaving 16 716 for the current analysis.
Outcome of interest
The main outcome of interest was all-cause mortality.
Mortality was recorded from the NHANES III linked
mortality file provided by the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS).22 Mortality assessments were conducted
from the baseline interview between 1988­94 through 31
December 2006. Mortality ascertainment was based on a
probabilistic match between NHANES III and National Death
Index death certificate records.
Measurement of exposure
PIR and educational status were chosen as measures of SES.
PIR was computed as the ratio of the midpoint of the observed
family income category to the family's appropriate poverty
threshold set by the US Census Bureau in a given calendar
year. PIR is one of the best available indicators of SES and is
widely used as an indicator of SES in many studies using the
NHANES data.23,24 PIR is a more sensitive SES measure than
income because it allows income data to be compared across
NHANES survey years as the income thresholds are adjusted
for inflation. A PIR of 1 indicates the official federal poverty
threshold. According to the 2009 Federal Poverty Guidelines,
this corresponds to an individual earning $10 830 per year, a
couple earning $14 570 per year, and a family of 3 earning
$18 310 per year.25 Accordingly, a PIR lower than 1 is defined
as poor, 1 to 1.9 as near poor, 2 to 3.9 as middle income, and
4 or higher as higher income. Educational status based on
completed years of education was ascertained from the
following questions, "What is the highest grade/year of
regular school you have ever attended?" and "Did you finish
that grade/year?", with the response categorized as less than
high school graduate (<12 years), high school graduate (12
years), and more than high school graduate (>12 years,
including college degree). We also assessed insurance status, a
strong correlate of income,26 as an alternative SES indicator.
Participants were considered to have insurance coverage if
they answered affirmatively to the question, "During the last
month were you covered by one or more health insurance
plans obtained privately or through an employer or union?"
Measurement of covariates
Age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol intake,
self-reported history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary
heart disease, stroke, cancer (excluding skin cancer), and
intake of oral hypoglycemic drug or insulin administration
or antihypertensive medication were assessed using a
standardized questionnaire at home interview. Individuals
who had smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes during their
lifetime were considered never smokers, those who had
smoked 100 or more cigarettes during their lifetime but did
not currently smoke were considered former smokers, and
those who had smoked 100 or more cigarettes during their
lifetime and currently smoked were considered current
smokers. Current alcohol drinking was defined as con-
sumption of 1 or more alcoholic drink in the past month.
One alcoholic drink was described as 360 mL of beer, 120 mL
of wine, or 30 mL of hard liquor. SRH was assessed with the
question, "Would you say your health in general is excellent,
very good, good, fair or poor?" with the responses collapsed
into 3 categories: excellent/very good, good, fair/poor.
Information on anthropometric, physical, and laboratory
measurements was obtained during the mobile examination
center (MEC) examination.27 Blood pressure (BP) was
measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer, and the
average of 3 measurements was used as the systolic
and diastolic BP values. Patients were considered to have
hypertension if they reported taking antihypertensive

medication, had a systolic BP of 140 mm Hg or higher, or a
diastolic BP of 90 mm Hg or higher. Body mass index (BMI)
was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of
the height in meters. Diabetes was defined as a serum glucose
level of 126 mg/dL or higher after fasting for a minimum of 8
hours, a serum glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher after
fasting less than 8 hours before their NHANES visit, self-
reported physician-diagnosed diabetes, or current use of oral
hypoglycemic medication or insulin. Serum total and high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were measured
enzymatically. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was defined
as self-reported history of coronary heart disease, myocardial
infarction, angina, or stroke. Participants were considered
physically active if they walked a mile or more without
stopping at least 20 times in the past month.
Statistical analysis
In the current analysis, PIR values were categorized into
quartiles. We compared selected characteristics of the
participants by quartiles of PIR using the chi-square test or
analysis of variance, as appropriate. We examined the
association between PIR and all-cause mortality using
logistic regression models. We calculated the odds ratio
(OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of all-cause mortality
associated with PIR quartiles using the highest quartile
(quartile 4) as the referent in 3 nested models: (1) age-
(years) and sex-adjusted model, (2) multivariable-adjusted
model 1 additionally adjusted for race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic
whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, others),
smoking (never, former, current), alcohol intake (absent,
present), hypertension (absent, present), diabetes (absent,
present), cancer (absent, present), CVD (absent, present),
mean arterial BP (mm Hg), BMI (kg/m2), HDL cholesterol
(mg/dL), and physical activity (absent, present), and (3)
multivariable-adjusted model 2 adjusted for all variables in
multivariable model 1 plus SRH (excellent/very good, good,
fair/poor). We then examined the association between
education and all-cause mortality using "more than high
school graduate" as the reference category, using similar
multivariable models. In subgroup analyses, we examined the
association between the 2 SES indicators (PIR and education)
and all-cause mortality stratified by sex and race-ethnicity. To
examine the dose-response association between SES and all-
cause mortality, we carried out statistical tests for linear trend
by modeling each SES indicator category as an ordinal
variable separately in the corresponding multivariable model.
Interactions between SES measures (PIR and education) and
sex and race-ethnicity were formally evaluated by including
cross-product interaction terms in the corresponding multi-
variable models. In a supplementary analysis, we examined
the association between SES and all-cause mortality using
insurance status as an alternative SES indicator in the same
multivariable models. Sample weights that accounted for
the unequal probabilities of selection, oversampling, and
nonresponse were applied to all analyses, using SUDAAN
(version 8.0; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, NC, USA) and SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA) software; standard errors (SEs) were
estimated using the Taylor series linearization method.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study population
by quartiles of PIR. Adults in the lowest PIR quartile: were
more likely to be younger, female, less than high school-
educated, and current smokers; had higher BMI and HDL
cholesterol; had higher prevalences of diabetes, hypertension,
and poor SRH; and were less likely to be non-Hispanic
whites, physically active, and have insurance coverage.
Table 2 shows the characteristics of the study population by
educational categories. Adults with less than a high school
education: were more likely to be older and current smokers;
had higher BMI, systolic BP, and HDL cholesterol; had higher
prevalences of diabetes, hypertension, CVD, cancer, and poor
SRH; and were less likely to be non-Hispanic whites, current
drinkers, physically active, and have insurance coverage.
The association between PIR and all-cause mortality is
shown in Table 3. The crude mortality rate was highest among
those in the lowest PIR quartile and lowest among those in the
highest PIR quartile. In logistic regression models, lower PIR
quartiles were associated with mortality in both the age-
and sex-adjusted model and multivariable model 1 (which
additionally adjusted for lifestyle and clinical risk factors).
Although additional adjustment for SRH in multivariable
model 2 attenuated this association, it remained significant.
When stratified by race-ethnicity, the association between
PIR quartiles and mortality was consistently present in
all categories of race-ethnicity (P-interaction between PIR
quartiles × race-ethnicity = 0.3 in multivariable model 2). The
association between education and all-cause mortality is
shown in Table 4. Similar to PIR, the crude mortality rate
was highest among those with less than a high school
education and lowest among those with more than a high
school education. In logistic regression models, decreasing
categories of education were associated with mortality in both
the age-and sex-adjusted model and multivariate model 1.
However, in contrast to the findings for PIR, additional
adjustment for SRH in multivariable model 2 considerably
attenuated the OR for low education, and the association
became nonsignificant. When stratified by race-ethnicity,
education was not associated with mortality among non-
Hispanic whites after adjustment for lifestyle and clinical risk
factors, whereas the association remained significant after
adjustment for lifestyle and clinical risk factors and SRH
in other race-ethnicities (P-interaction between education
categories × race-ethnicity = 0.02 in multivariable model 2).

education) and all-cause mortality stratified by sex and race-

PIR and mortality was significant among both non-Hispanic
whites and other race-ethnicities, whereas the association
in women was not significant in either non-Hispanic

DISCUSSION
In a nationally representative sample of US adults, lower
PIR--a measure of low SES--was associated with mortality,
independent of SRH or demographic, lifestyle, or clinical risk
factors. This association between lower PIR and mortality was
significant in all racial-ethnic groups. In contrast, an initial
association between lower education and mortality that was
present after adjustment for demographic factors was not
statistically significant after adjusting for lifestyle and clinical
risk factors in non-Hispanic whites; however, it remained
significant in other race-ethnicities even after multivariate
adjustment.
With regards to the income-mortality association, our
results are consistent with past studies that identified an
independent dose-response relationship between lower
income and all-cause mortality.7,28­33 Our study contributes
to the existing literature by showing that income is associated
with mortality even after adjusting for SRH and lifestyle
and clinical factors, suggesting a relatively independent
role. This is similar to the findings from the EPIC-Norfolk
study, which showed that occupation has a modest residual
effect on mortality even after adjusting for SRH.19
Concerning the education-mortality association, past
research has mostly been inconclusive regarding the
association between lower education and mortality, with
more studies reporting an independent association34­37 than
not.7 Our result that adjusting for SRH and lifestyle and
clinical risk factors in the multivariable model mostly
explained the education-mortality association in non-
Hispanic whites, but not in other racial-ethnic groups, is a
new addition to the literature.
In contrast to the education-mortality association, which we
found to be mostly explained by SRH and lifestyle and
clinical risk factors, the residual association with mortality for
income indicates the influence of factors that may not easily
be conceived by individuals responding to the question on
SRH. These may include contextual factors38 or political,
economic, cultural, or historic factors39 that may shape an
individual's exposure and access to public infrastructure and
health care, which are not captured in SRH. Therefore, there is
a need for more research in this field to elucidate the role of

income on mortality that is not explained by lifestyle and
clinical risk factors or SRH.
In non-Hispanic whites, the education-mortality association
became statistically insignificant after adjusting for SRH and
lifestyle and clinical risk factors. In contrast, among other
race-ethnicities, an educational gradient was still apparent
after adjusting for SRH and clinical and lifestyle factors. It is
possible that increased awareness of the role of lifestyle and
clinical risk factors in health among non-Hispanic whites
resulted in the narrowing of educational differences in
mortality in this population.40 In minority ethnicities, it may
be that education's role in health is greater than that perceived
and influenced by the individual. In this sense, the residual
effects of education in minority ethnicities after adjustment
for SRH may be an indicator of differential availability
of educational resources across ethnicities in the society. A
corollary observation is that health inequalities, including the
education-mortality differences that we observed, are still
heavily influenced by racial/ethnic differences in the United
States. Therefore, it is vital to formulate active federal and
state policies that expand health and educational services and
opportunities across all race-ethnicities, along with improving
attitudes and promoting lifestyle changes.
The association between lower PIR and mortality was
significant in both non-Hispanic white men and those of
other race-ethnic groups, but not in women. It is possible
that men with low income may be exposed to more
work-related deaths or indulge in unhealthy lifestyle,
including excessive alcohol,40 or cigarette smoking.41 Our
results are consistent with a previous systematic review of
observational cohort studies from developed countries, which
found that socioeconomic inequalities in mortality were more
pronounced in men than in women, using absolute measures
of inequality.42 However, it is also understood that sex
differences in the SES-health association may depend on the
SES measure employed in a study and its characteristics
(eg, relative or absolute SES terms) and that the association
is also highly context-oriented, largely due to differences
in cultural or societal characteristics among countries and
populations (eg, by age groups).
We found that lack of health insurance coverage--an
indicator of access to care--was associated with mortality,
independent of SRH or demographic, clinical, or lifestyle risk
factors. Two thirds of uninsured persons in the United States
are from low-income households that are unable to afford
either healthcare insurance or out-of-pocket healthcare costs.43
Studies have shown that lack of health insurance is associated
with increased risk of mortality due to difficulty in accessing
healthcare services and poor quality of healthcare in both
preventive services and management of chronic diseases.44,45
An important contribution of our study is the fact that
we had adequate sample size and ethnicity-specific data,
which permitted detailed stratified analyses by race-ethnicity.
We found that even after adjusting for SRH and demographic,
lifestyle, and clinical risk factors, PIR was significantly
associated with mortality in non-Hispanic whites as
well as other race-ethnicities. In contrast, education was
independently associated with mortality in other race-
ethnicities only. In non-Hispanic whites, the association
between education and mortality that was initially evident
after adjusting for age and sex was substantially attenuated
and lost statistical significance after additional adjustment
for lifestyle and clinical risk factors. After additional
adjustment for SRH, the magnitude of the association was
further weakened. Our results are thus consistent with the
hypothesis that various SES variables may interact differently
with race-ethnicity in complex ways to cause health effects
and higher mortality. For example, our results suggest that
lower education is independently related to mortality in
racial-ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic whites; whereas,
low PIR was related to mortality in both non-Hispanic whites
and other race-ethnicities. A corollary observation is that as
a public health intervention strategy, improving education
may be more beneficial in other race-ethnicities than in non-
Hispanic whites, whereas improving income may be equally
beneficial in both groups.
There are several limitations in our study. Firstly, lower
socioeconomic status has been significantly associated with
higher morbidity for chronic diseases such as diabetes,46
hypertension,6 cardiovascular diseases,47 and end-stage renal
diseases,48 all of which can increase mortality. Our adjustment
of these variables may have been inadequate, and residual
confounding from these factors may lead to overestimation of
the effect of socioeconomic variables on mortality. Secondly,
ascertainment of SES, clinical conditions, health behavioral
aspects, and SRH was performed only once, at the time of
NHANES III. Due to variability in these factors over time, our
results may be biased due to time-varying confounding by
these factors. Finally, we excluded occupation as measure of
SES in our analysis, as it was imprecise among women and
retirees in the sample. However, we believe that exclusion of
occupation status from the analyses is unlikely to have biased
the study findings, as it was previously established that
income might be a better SES indicator of health, given that
employment status is a subset of income.20 The availability of
a large and nationally representative sample, along with rich
covariate information, is a major strength of our study.
In conclusion, we found that lower PIR was associated with
mortality in all racial-ethnic groups, independent of SRH
or demographic, lifestyle, or clinical risk factors. In contrast,
lower education was not significantly associated with
mortality in non-Hispanic whites, although the association
remained significant in other race-ethnicities. While our
results suggest that adjusting for SRH resulted in only a
modest change in the SES-mortality association beyond
lifestyle and clinical risk factors, our findings also highlight
the significance of racial-ethnic variations in socioeconomic
disparities in health in relation to education.
