Cognitive Mobilization
The concept of Cognitive Mobilization (CM) put forward by
Inglehart (1977, 1990) states that in postindustrial societies,
how citizens' political participation is formed is affected by
the fact that they are generally better educated and have
increased access to information. Inglehart studies the evolu-
tion of CM and its effects in different societies to make com-
parative observations of how much it depends on other
factors, such as economic and cultural development. To mea-
sure the influence of these factors, Inglehart combines a cross-
sectional analysis of European societies (observing different
levels of economic development) with, principally, a longitu-
dinal study to determine the effect that the level of education
has on different age groups, under the clear premise that levels
of education and access to information are on the rise. This
article considers Inglehart's hypotheses and updates the time
frame that he analyzed by a matter of decades. Extending this
time period not only corroborates some of Inglehart's conclu-
sions but also introduces nuances and modifications in others,
in the light of the analysis of new data.
Inglehart sees CM as a central aspect within a broader
process. The context is that of modernization and the devel-
opment of Western societies. In his work, The Silent
Revolution, he defines it as follows:
We are interested in these changes insofar as they con-
tribute to the process of Cognitive Mobilization. The
essence of this process is the development of the skills
needed to manipulate political abstractions and thereby
to coordinate activities that are remote in space or
time. Without such skills, one is more or less doomed
to remain an outsider to the political life of a modern
nation-state. Consequently, historical changes in the
distribution of these skills have been a major factor in
defining the politically relevant public.
Social Mobilization is a broad process. Western countries
have long since completed many of its most important
stages, such as urbanisation, basic industrialisation, wide-
spread literacy, mass military service, and universal suf-
frage. Nevertheless, an essential aspect continues -the
very core of the process: the increasingly wide dissemi-
nation of the skills necessary to cope with an extensive
political community. We use the term "Cognitive
Mobilization" to refer to this central aspect of the broader
process. (Inglehart, 1977, pp. 295-297)
In the model developed, the established sequence con-
siders structural changes in various fields (economic,
social, political, and cultural) that mutually affect one
another: Development and economic and urban growth due
to modernization run parallel to the process of a better edu-
cated and more informed population and to an end to scar-
city. The end of scarcity produces a change in hierarchy of
predominant values, moving from those aimed at satisfying

The Cognitive Mobilization Index: Crises
and Political Generations
Antonio Alaminos1 and Clemente Penalva1
Abstract
This article shows how the cognitive mobilization index, designed for use in observing potential political participation, can be
used as an indicator of the political climate that a particular society is going through. Following a discussion of the theoretical
elaborations (and their working definitions) of the concept of cognitive mobilization, a longitudinal study of various European
countries is used to consider the question of how political crises influence cognitive mobilization indexes and what effects
they have on the political socialization process among the youngest cohorts.

basic needs (security) to those aimed at meeting the need
for self-expression.
Of all these changes, the most significant in CM terms is
that of the population being better educated and more
informed. This increase is central because it means increased
autonomy for subjects in terms of bureaucratized forms and
classic hierarchies linked to politics (the political party,
chiefly), a preference for new (unconventional) forms of par-
ticipation and, in short, an approximation of the practice of
direct (top-down) democracy.
Thus, the development of the concept of CM relates
clearly to the classical meaning of the concept of public
opinion: the discussion of public issues by informed citizens.
To an extent, it takes up the idea of small political communi-
ties in which political communication occurs face-to-face
and develops through direct knowledge of public issues,
facilitating collective decision making.
A precursor to what could in terms of political culture be
called the "cognitive mobilization theory" is the concept of
"subjective political competence" as described by Almond
and Verba (1964), which is used to study citizen involvement
in the political system. Their interest was to establish a the-
ory as to how citizens perceived political structures and insti-
tutions by studying their opinions. The aim was to observe to
what extent people surveyed believed that they could partici-
pate in political decisions at a local level. The greater the
subjective competence, the higher the probability of being
politically active. The authors conclude that well-informed
citizens with higher status possess greater subjective compe-
tence (defined as the extent to which citizens think that they
can influence political decisions) and a higher chance of par-
ticipating in politics. Alongside this sense of "political effi-
cacy" is "political orientation" (community involvement and
very politically informed).
Much of the literature on CM has focused on the link to
political parties. The oldest precursors of this are found in
Campbell, Gurin, and Miller (1954), who were the first to
reflect on the phenomenon of party identification. For these
authors, this phenomenon is psychological and it has emo-
tional components that are formed during the process of
socialization, and the main source of which is the family.
They are interested in how attitudes are formed and political
participation, with the political party as the main agent.
Campbell and Converse (1960), however, draw the conclu-
sion that the political party acts as a funnel model. As an
agent of political socialization, this model determines the
attitudes and votes of citizens, who develop a feeling of emo-
tional identification toward a party's "label." The conclusion
is that it is political parties that translate abstract political
concepts for citizens and offer them an interpretation of
reality.
Another concept closely linked to CM is "political sophis-
tication," as discussed by Converse (1964), who studies the
degree of influence of ideology and beliefs in political
behavior. The author's aim is to determine the degree of
coherence of citizens' ideological constructs and measure
their ability to understand and apply political information
when assessing certain issues or deciding how to vote. The
relationship between interpretation, system of beliefs, and
education leads to the concept of "political sophistication."
For Converse, the most politically sophisticated are those
who are most highly educated, politically involved, and well
informed, while political party identification facilitated the
decision-making process for voting, preferably in less politi-
cally sophisticated voters. Another important contribution is
Shively's (1979) functional model, in which political parties
translate political information for citizens. This is because
party identification is a cost-saving device in the decision-
making process of which party to vote for. With higher levels
of education, there is less need for party guidance.
Together with Inglehart, Dalton's works have been the most
influential in the research of CM. Dalton (1984) uses the con-
cept of "cognitive mobilization" to create a classification sys-
tem for political party identification that is widely used in the
study of political participation (apartisans, cognitive partisans,
ritual partisans, and apoliticals). Dalton defines CM as a pro-
cess by which more people acquire the resources and skills that
help them to face the complexities of politics and make their
own decisions. The variables of level of education and interest
in politics are used to create the index. For Dalton, just as for
Inglehart, a progressive increase in education leads to an
increase in independent citizens (high CM and low party iden-
tification). Although he observes that party identification has
been positively correlated with CM, this relationship should
change when younger cohorts are incorporated, as not only do
they have higher levels of education, they also have greater
access to political information through their exposure to the
mass media.
Dalton's work has had notable repercussions and has been
widely reviewed by other authors, including the author him-
self (Dalton, 2007), presenting new models that analyze
party identification. In general, criticism of the Dalton model
comes from the empirical evidence that in some countries,
party identification has not dropped in any considerable way,
and has even risen. Dalton defends himself from criticism in
a recent study on German voters (2010). In his review of
Dalton's works, Albright (2009) asserts that it is risky to
draw any conclusions regarding the progressive drop in party
identification. The problem arises when the two phenomena
occur simultaneously (identification and CM based on the
indicators for "interest in politics" and "level of education"),
in which case it is impossible to determine whether CM is
the cause (Albright, 2009, p. 251).
Berglund, Holmberg, Schmitt, and Thomassen (2005)
observe that contextual factors have not been taken suffi-
ciently into account, such as the degree of polarization between
parties. Polarization may lead subjects to perceive greater
ideological differences between parties and for party identifi-
cation and partisanship to rise. Huber, Kernel, and Leoni
(2005) assert that changes in party identification may be due
Alaminos and Penalva 3
more to the institutional political context than to changes in
social structure, and that the degree of party identification
depends on the nature of the competition between parties.
In general, it is assumed that deficiencies in the models
applied in Europe are the result of the differences in the
political and electoral system, the political culture, and other
historic aspects. Contextual factors, for instance, have not
been sufficiently developed, although some authors have
pointed this out in the study of political involvement and
party identification. This clearly responds to the difficulty in
incorporating an excess of variables into such a study, but
according to Inglehart's concept of CM (central part of a
broad process), this is essential.
It could be concluded that CM theory encompasses all
works that use it as an explanatory variable of the changes that
occur among younger generations in postindustrial societies,
characterized at times by low levels of electoral participation
and party identification. Discussion in recent years over the
theory is whether there really are more or fewer "partisans" in
terms of identification and whether there is more or less par-
ticipation in elections for Dalton's different categories of par-
tisans. It is our belief that within the CM theory, its influence
on voting and party identification has been overstated in many
studies, particularly those referring to the United States.
Whereas for Dalton, CM is used as an independent vari-
able to explain changes in party identification and voting,
Inglehart uses it to explain contemporary political culture in
terms of participation. However, in both cases, the relation-
ships of causality are hard to establish. In Dalton's terms,
CM is what explains the changes in participation and party
identification, with important criticism, as stated previously.
In Inglehart's view, CM is above all a symptom: Structural
changes have their correlation in the variation of CM just as
in changes in values, education, and information. In turn, by
changing how citizens perceive and participate in politics (in
terms of political efficacy), CM has an influence on these
factors and on contextual factors. In fact, as has been seen,
various articles refer to these factors as aspects that have not
been sufficiently dealt with in theory and which would
explain the differences between countries (political culture,
history, electoral system, or political system) or between dif-
ferent historic moments (electoral polarization, and crisis
and inflation, which are treated lightly by Inglehart).
However, here we are concerned with an interesting product
of Inglehart's studies: how political participation takes shape.
Due to the effect of disassociation with parties, the rise in infor-
mation and the change in priority in terms of young people's
values (more postmaterialist), electoral participation is not the
only form of political expression. Unconventional forms of
political action and the formation of ad hoc structures as a way
of making demands are more likely in societies with a higher
level of CM. Due to the effects of increased education, the gen-
erational change means an increase in "potential" political par-
ticipation and, more importantly, a drop in the importance of
suffrage. For a population that has moved beyond materialist
values, the vote is no longer as important. There are other prior-
ity interests (environment, solidarity, identity) where uncon-
ventional forms of political expression can be used, relegating
the vote to a secondary plane. Votes will be used to the extent
that the issues at stake in the ballot box will affect what is
hoped to be achieved according to these new values.
In short, for the purposes of this study, the conceptual and
working definitions developed by Inglehart in his publica-
tions are used here. The main virtues of Inglehart's work can
be summed up in the following aspects: (a) It incorporates the
concept of CM as a "potential" political action, conceived as
a central aspect within a broader process of modernization of
the political systems; (b) it attends to the different forms of
political action (including unconventional methods); and (c)
it produces a CM index that does not include its explanatory
determinants (such as the level of education) in its definition
and introduces two basic elements that point to the classic
definition of democracy and public opinion (frequency of dis-
cussion about politics and attempts at persuasion), linking the
individual level to the group level.
Method
In his study on European democracies, Inglehart (1990)
establishes a series of hypotheses on the effects and evolu-
tion of CM. He basically considers three hypotheses:
1. Increased CM reduces the influence that politi-
cal parties have on public opinion and of citizens'
identification with political parties.
2. Because they are better educated and more
informed, young people should show a greater
degree of CM. In general, this increased level of
cognitive political mobilization makes them more
politically sophisticated.
3. A generalized increase in CM and participation is
caused by (a) incorporation of women, (b) higher
level of education, and (c) changes in evaluative
priorities toward individual self-expression, to the
detriment of the needs for survival.
The second thesis is the subject of validation and study in
this analysis, by extending the data series originally used by
Inglehart. We give a detailed consideration of two conclu-
sions regarding generational change and the process of
political maturation among young people.
1. Inglehart checks these hypotheses by using Euroba-
rometer surveys from 1973 to 1987 and shows the
trend toward greater CM in European societies. In
terms of cohort analysis, people born after World War
II who were young in the 1960s are the most politi-
cally mobilized.Although Inglehart observes the his-
torical period that this highly mobilized generation
lived through (May 1968, mobilizations against the
4 SAGE Open
war in Vietnam, the Prague Spring), he indicates that
this maximum is reached through increased access to
information and a higher level of education.
2. In his second hypothesis on generational change,
Inglehart writes that younger people are less mobi-
lized because they need a period in which to mature
politically and become incorporated into public life.
A cohort analysis indicates that as young people
"mature," their CM increases. This is observed in the
group born between 1956 and 1965, who begin as
the second least politicized group in 1973 (they were
below 18 years of age), and who quickly increase in
political mobilization as they become adults, so that
in 1983 they have become one of the most politicized
cohorts, practically on a par with the cohort born
between 1946 and 1955, as Inglehart explains:
Here, life cycle effects clearly are present ­but they work
in the opposite direction from than specified by the
"aging produces disengagement" hipótesis: People are
less apt to discuss politics during their preadult years, but
upon reaching adulthood, the younger and more educated
cohorts show higher rates of political discusión than do
the older cohorts. This explains the anomaly . . . The
youngest age group is, at any given point in time, less
politicized than some of the older groups not because of
a reversal of trends but because it has not yet reached
political maturity. (Inglehart, 1990, pp. 346-347)
This article focuses on the hypotheses regarding the
increase in CM among young people. Inglehart introduces
cohort analysis to determine how the progressive global
increase in levels of education has an effect on the CM of
societies, in such a way that an increase would be observed
in the level of politicization because the younger (better edu-
cated) generations replace less educated cohorts from the
adult population. Thus, regarding Inglehart's theses, the
hypotheses to test in this article are the following:
Hypothesis
Hypothesis 1: The CM index is sensitive to political
crises. Times of particular political and social unrest
produce an increase in CM above the structural
increases expected by the effect of the rise in levels
of education and greater access to information.
Hypothesis 2: Political crises distort the sequence of
political maturation and its relationship with CM,
with two effects:
a. In these periods, younger generations reach greater
levels of mobilization than generations that have
reached maturity due to the life cycle.
b. These periods alter the substitution process (with
regard to maximum levels of mobilization) of pre-
vious (less well-educated) cohorts by subsequent
(better educated) cohorts, as the cohorts that live
through these periods in their youth retain high
rates of mobilization throughout their lives.
These hypotheses are tested for the set of updated data on
CM that is available in the European Barometer database: in
the first hypothesis, using an analysis on admissible cases
such as that of the transition to democracy experienced by
Southern European countries in the 1970s (Portugal, Greece,
and Spain), which reproduce the climate of political inten-
sity and leave a political mark on a generation, and in the
second, by incorporating data to the series so as to obtain a
wider time frame than that used by Inglehart.
Indicators
CM is such a broad concept that reducing it to only a few indica-
tors leads to problems. Indeed, in developing his theory, Inglehart
uses different indicators to explain changes in the societies ana-
lyzed. In The Silent Revolution, the index (four levels) is obtained
from frequency of discussion and attempts at persuasion (leaving
education to one side, as it correlated strongly with income and
occupation), but in Culture Shift, Inglehart uses "frequency of
discussion," on one hand, for the analysis of cohorts as an indica-
tor of "potential political participation" (not CM), and discussion
and instruction (five levels), on the other hand, to observe the
influence on "unconventional political action" in different coun-
tries. In fact, the Eurobarometer contains two indexes: CM Index
1 (discussion and persuasion without instruction; four levels) and
CM Index 2 (discussion, persuasion, and instruction; five levels).
Index 1 has the greatest temporal scope, as it allows the whole
series to be established up to the present day.
This index is built using the combination of answers to two
questions: how often people try to convince others of their own
opinions (When you hold a strong opinion, do you ever find
yourself persuading your friends, relatives, or fellow workers
to share your views? If so, does this happen often, from time to
time, or rarely?) and how often political issues are discussed
(When you get together with your friends, would you say you
discuss political matters frequently, occasionally, or never?)
(Table 1).
The combination of these two questions (talking about
politics and trying to convince) creates four levels of CM. The
highest of these represents those who show the greatest degree
of mobilization and participation in social life, and the two
intermediary levels refer to qualities of cognitive political par-
ticipation above and below the average. The lowest refers to
those with minimal social participation. Dichotomizing the
index into two large categories produces "medium-high and
high CM" and "medium-low and low CM." The indicator
directly expresses the degree of participation in political dis-
cussion spontaneously and individually, without it being
Alaminos and Penalva 5
regulated or institutionalized. However, it is associated with
the expected characteristics: Those with greater capacity for
political mobilization also show greater interest in politics and
a high level of education and media usage.
We used the indicators that the Eurobarometer produced
from their theoretical contributions and empirical tests. The
CM indicator resulting from the discussion on the concept in
recent decades is set out in summarized form. As indicated
above, although the importance of the level of education is
assumed as an indicator of political competence and capac-
ity, the Eurobarometer dispenses with this variable due to its
association with other factors that explain CM, such as social
class.
However, the CM index that the Eurobarometer uses
allows us to conduct empirical tests from the same data
source that Inglehart used. In operative terms, this indicator
separates the causes that lead to CM (education and informa-
tion) from mobilization in itself and is backed up by
Inglehart's initial definitions regarding direct political par-
ticipation in the agora as a place to debate public issues.
Inglehart gives priority to variables that measure participa-
tion by means of conversation and discussion with others,
and considers that this is a better indicator of activism than
electoral participation figures. The Eurobarometer surveys
include the variables "frequency of discussion on political
issues" and "trying to convince others of one's own opin-
ion," thus qualifying (objective) conversation with a motiva-
tional element, expressed by the intent to convince others of
one's own opinion. This then is a definition of a specific con-
cept of participation that inserts debate about politics within
the context of everyday life. This is why it is also used to
detect "opinion leaders," which in a way alludes to the notion
of transmitting political information in two steps (Lazarsfeld,
Berelson, & Gaudet, 1944), without the involvement of
mediating bodies such as political parties.
An important advance in Inglehart's CM indicator is that
education has been removed when creating the indicator.
Education ensures that people are enabled to interpret infor-
mation coming from the media. It is clear that the role the
media play in forming attitudes and opinions and in inter-
personal communication varies from one sociocultural
context to another. The media's influence differs widely
depending on citizens'level of education, which by theoretical
association with CM brings the problem of interdependence
on other variables such as social class. This identification
can be observed in other very similar concepts, such as the
political sophistication of MacDonald, Rabinowitz, and
Listhaug (1995) and the political attention of Zaller (1992).
Dalton (1984) produces an index using the variables of edu-
cation (degree of competence) and interest in politics
(involvement and participation). Inglehart also initially
includes level of education and participation in political dis-
cussion (Inglehart, 1977; Inglehart & Klingemann, 1976) as
an index of CM. A society's level of education is incorpo-
rated into how the index is built because of the strong asso-
ciation between education and other indicators used to build
the CM index. This makes several authors conclude that the
level of education should be included in the index, despite
its limitations (Inglehart, 1977, 1990). However, it does not
appear to be a particularly useful contribution because the
different meanings of the level of education indicator mean
that it relates to three different socioeconomic indicators:
competence and the objective education of individuals,
social class/status, and socialization (Cassel & Lo, 1997). In
all cases, the importance placed on interaction between indi-
viduals is a constant in the design of indicators of CM.
Another concept incorporated into the hypothesis test is
that of crisis. A crisis is a moment in which the occurrence of
a certain event with a certain degree of "impact" provokes
high commotion in the population. In etic terms, political cri-
ses would be moments, within a broad spectrum of phenom-
ena, in which a substantial political change occurs, or there is
major debate about the possibility of such a change, (a) of
internal origin: regime change, reforms in the system, politi-
cal changes of a territorial nature, and economic reforms or
(b) of external origin (with regard to other countries), the
result of which ranges from diplomatic tension to military
intervention.
Yet, however hard we try to complete and fine-tune this
typology, it comes up against a phenomenological (emic)
argument. Because these events have a major impact, the
question of the perception of these occurrences is a central
one. And because this is a question of perception, how citi-
zens interpret information becomes hugely relevant. In this
sense, the mass media play a key role (their influence is indi-
rect, as the meaning belongs to the receiver) and indicators
could be used (monitoring the media, where the events are
placed in news media, emphasis measures--number of news
and information items, font size, presence of images). These
aspects have been discussed in a previous article (Alaminos
& Penalva, 2010), in which the mass communication theory,
particularly the agenda-setting theory and the framing the-
ory, is highly useful.
Building political climate indexes on the bases of media
indicators (press distribution, content analysis, user num-
bers) for each country considered goes beyond the objectives

of this research. However, we find it hard to question certain
moments of history as political crises according to previous
attempts to classify them: the European cultural revolutions
of the late 1960s, the transitions to democratic regimes in
Southern Europe in the second half of the 1970s, and the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
Data and Sources
The data used is drawn from the Eurobarometers.1 It is impor-
tant to note that more years are considered than those studied
by Inglehart and the data that the author used are included in
the study. In this sense, the study replicates and extends his
analysis. The Eurobarometer is a survey conducted in several
European countries. For many years, the inclusion criteria
were for the country to belong to the European Economic
Community or the EU. However, the survey was extended to
countries whose entry into the EU was pending. It is con-
ducted every 4 months and with an average sample size of
1,000 interviews per country, a figure that varies depending
on the population.
In particular, this work studies the effects on CM in two
historic stages of notable political, social, and cultural unrest
that had an extraordinary effect on various European societ-
ies: the mobilizations that occurred at the end of the 1960s in
European countries with democratic regimes, typified by
France in May 1968, and the mobilizations that occurred
during the process of political transition in Mediterranean
countries whose autocratic regimes came to an end in the
mid-1970s (Greece, Portugal, and Spain).
Results
The results are presented as a graphic analysis. For each
country, the distribution of relative frequencies of CM is
charted each year in 10-year cohorts. The distributions are
arranged in yearly intervals. In this way, it is possible to
appreciate trends and inflections in the replacement of
cohorts, and the structural relationship between them for each
year. Each cohort is defined by the following age intervals, in
years: 14 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, 45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to
74, and more than 74. Thus, graphical analysis (in a yearly
base) is useful to appreciate cohort, period and aging effects.
The data is shown in three charts. Figures 1 and 2 show the
two types of models (general patterns of evolution of CM and
specific patterns of transition, respectively), and Figure 3
shows a mixed model of the Federal Republic of Germany
and the landmark of unification in 1989, which can be com-
pared with the processes of transition experienced by the
democracies of Southern Europe.
The growing trend of CM indices and the postwar generation.
In general terms, the new data validate Inglehart's hypothe-
ses. In the past four decades, the increase in the level of edu-
cation and the growth of and increased access to the media
have been accompanied by an increase in the level of CM.
The trend is clear and the hypothesis is partially confirmed.
A rising trend can be observed in all the European countries
considered. The cohorts born in postwar Europe are consid-
erably more mobilized than those born before World War II.
However, no sustained growth in mobilization can be
observed with each new cohort. On the contrary, the genera-
tion of the 1960s reaches a landmark in mobilization with
regard to new generations, who have lower levels of partici-
pation. The maximums detected by Inglehart in the genera-
tion born in the postwar period distort this trend. These are
remarkably high percentages of CM, leading to a series of
considerations. First, it should be observed that they coincide
with a particularly "hot" moment in history in terms of the
political climate, which was characterized by a general atmo-
sphere of social and cultural revolution throughout Europe,
expressed in the form of mass protests (the war in Vietnam,
May 1968 in France, the Prague Spring), and in changes in
customs and social norms, of which the main protagonists
were the younger generations. Second, it can be seen how
this distortion is prolonged in its effects, as the cohort in
question maintains high rates of political mobilization dur-
ing the following decades, due to having experienced the
most intense era of political socialization in those socially
convulsive years. Thus, their high exposure to social and
political participation remains and revolutionizes the genera-
tional structure. Subsequent generations tend to show less
participation (due to there being fewer left-wing and other
sociopolitical characteristics).
A very similar change dynamic, but with a different his-
toric origin, can be observed in the countries that lived
through the transition to a democratic regime in the 1970s.
The process of maturation and new generational distortions
(Greece, Portugal, and Spain). For Inglehart, the process of
political maturation among young people raises their CM
when they reach sufficient political competence. The effect
of this maturation can be observed in the "horseshoe" shape
of the time frame that marks the highest CM in cohorts aged
25 to 34 years, who were previously aged 14 to 24 years. In
Portugal, Greece, and Spain, a generational delay can be
seen, in the extent to which the most participatory generation
is that aged 14 to 24 years at the time of the political transi-
tion to democracy. The general process leads from an ordered
linear generational structure in the functional relationship
with CM to another horseshoe-shaped form (nonmonotonic
linear). The stability of the generational position in the
30-year period considered makes it possible to see the matu-
ration process and change of position in the life cycle. The
cases of Greece and Spain experience a process of character-
istically horseshoe-shaped transformation, with young peo-
ple less participatory than those of the transition and a lesser
variability among generations that can be seen when the seg-
ments are shortened. The case of Portugal is an exception.
Young people maintain a high level of participation and the
trend is one of increased variability between generations, as
can be observed in the growth of the segment.

Within this horseshoe structure, which is very clear in the
data expressed in 10-year cohorts, a subprocess occurs by
which the new cohort that is incorporated appears with a
very low level with regard to the previous cohort. The matu-
ration and life cycle effect means that this cohort, which is at
such a low level, 10 years later reaches a similar level to that
of the previous cohort. As previously in other European
countries with regard to the generation of 1968, the genera-
tions that were politically socialized in the transition to
democracy maintain a higher level of CM than those that
succeed them. This generation, which "breaks" continuity,
has higher levels of CM than those which replace it. This will
have a clear statistical effect, first by weakening and then by
breaking the association between age and CM. Each country
shows specific features associated with the crises described.
However, this maturation process that marks a level of
political participation associated with the life cycle displays
nuances in moments of crisis. This can be observed by study-
ing generational patterns in certain moments of political
upheaval, where younger people have the highest levels of
mobilization. This is the case of Germany in the early 1990s
after the fall of the Berlin wall and the reunification process,
of France with the disturbances in Paris protesting the situa-
tion of the immigrant population, and of Spain following the
terrorist attacks in Madrid in 2004.
In the transnational dimension, with the data from 1982,
Inglehart saw Greece as an atypical case: a country with a low
economic level but high CM. He defined this as a "striking
deviant case" in his cross-sectional analysis and interpreted it
as an effect of the influence of the tradition of the former city-
state democracies. The effect of the period of transition to
democracy, which was not considered by Inglehart, could be
a better explanation and could also explain the historical
maximums found in our analysis: the generation that was
young in the political climate of 1968 records a maximum
level. Subsequent generations, with higher levels of mobiliza-
tion than those born after World War II, tend to be compara-
tively lower than those of 1968. The same occurs for the
generations that lived through those times of transition to
democracy in the countries considered.
We present a mixed model, between the postwar society
type of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, and the soci-
ety in transition type of Greece, Portugal, and Spain. The
Federal Republic of Germany shows patterns from both
models, which strengthens the hypothesis. On one hand,
there is a trend of increasing political mobilization among
successive postwar generations, with a sharp increase in
mobilization scores for the generation involved in the 1968
mobilizations. On the other hand, the early 1990s show a
change in the basic horseshoe shape in the change of cohorts,
with an increase in mobilization observed in younger genera-
tions, canceling out the process of political maturation. This
is a politically hot moment reflecting the reunification pro-
cess after the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989.
Discussion and Conclusions
In this work, as well as the general trend of modernization
that can be seen in all the societies studied, it is also possible
to observe the foreseeable anomalies of each case, reflecting
the historical political circumstance of each country.
Inglehart's hypotheses are subtly altered. The advantages of
having a longer historical series than that which the author
used means that we can state that the historic period at the

end of the 1960s crossed with the general rising trend in
levels of education and the availability of and access to the
media. By taking other historic moments of increased politi-
cal tension, we can state that the period effect explains the
trends more precisely, and explains the anomalies that Inglehart
found, as is the case for Greece. He interpreted this anomaly
as the repercussion of the country's classical tradition linked
to political discussion in the agora.
We consider that in his works, Inglehart gave sufficient
consideration to two of the three effects considered in cohort
analysis: that of maturation (in terms of the process of acquir-
ing political competence) and that of cohort (which explains
how patterns of mobilization are maintained depending on the
time in history when political socialization is most intense).
However, he underestimated the importance of time period.
The period effect affects society as a whole, corresponding to
an exceptional political or social climate. We know it is not
possible to determine the effect that, independently, can be
attributed to the period, age, or cohort.As Glenn (2005) states,
the effect of cohort (C, year of birth), the effect of age (A, year
since birth), and period (P, current year) are linear and addi-
tive. Separated effects can not be estimated.
To illustrate the effect of the period and its interaction
with cohort and maturation, this article includes similar
political situations (in terms of the intensity of the political
climate and its effects on political participation in general)
such as the political transition of the European countries con-
sidered (Greece, Portugal, and Spain). Thus, considering this
effect, Inglehart's conclusions must be modified, as it can be
confirmed that the historical maximum in CM of the genera-
tion of 1968 is due to the atypical context of the political
climate.
Thus, even though CM effectively defines a potential for
participation, whether this is activated depends on the con-
text. Political crises raise the level of mobilization in general,
but this increase occurs to a greater extent in younger cohorts,
who are more qualified in cognitive terms. The level of
mobilization shows a growing trend for a set of countries
that already had high levels of mobilization. For another set
of countries, it can be seen how this average level tends to
remain stable, with changes in growth and contraction that
coincide with "hot" periods or political crises. In this sense,
it is not appropriate to consider as a general thesis that
increases in the number of citizens with CM capacities are a
direct and mechanical consequence of conditions such as
education, available media, or economic development.
Rather, for certain countries, CM (talking about and discuss-
ing politics with other citizens) develops circumstantially,
depending on the sociopolitical context and climate. Within
the average level of mobilization displayed by society, it can
be seen how the indicator is sensitive to the most relevant
crises, leading to discontinuous trends and altering the pro-
cess of political maturation. With the consideration of con-
textual and circumstantial factors, the CM index would
show greater utility when diagnosing, understanding, and
foreseeing social mobilizations, as it considers a key element
of its theoretical definition to be direct democracy and the
consideration of unconventional forms of participation,
which are more present at times of crisis.
Therefore, by introducing the period element, two of
Inglehart's statements need modifying: the first, which states
that the level of education automatically has an influence on
levels of CM by raising participation as a structural pattern,
and the second, which considers the life cycle as a necessary
element of political maturation. Inglehart's theses do not
give sufficient consideration to CM as a potential that is acti-
vated by reacting to circumstances to the point of producing
functional discontinuous patterns in the relationship between
age and CM, as well as distortions in the process of political
maturation and its relationship with the life cycle.2 Certain
historic events mobilize younger generations who, according
to Inglehart, should not have reached that level of political
maturity. These crises clearly mark the trends of mobiliza-
tion for all his biography, as these events coincide with the
era of greatest political socialization. As can be deduced in
the analysis, "testing" the direct democracy that Inglehart
spoke of at times when the process of socialization (youth) is
at its most intense allows tools and knowledge of political
practice to be acquired that will be retained for the rest of
one's life. This political learning is supported by the cogni-
tive basis of education and information but reinforces the
pragmatic (rational) dimension of "political efficacy" and
the identity (emotional) dimension due to the links within a
group acquired in that generational experience.
There are a series of works that deals with a closely
related concept, namely "political generation," as discussed
by Mannheim, which links the political experiences of each
cohort in the most intense periods of socialization, as youth
tends to be. We have found some studies that discuss the phe-
nomenon of political socialization by linking the period and
cohort effects, such as the works by Cavalli (2004), Hooghe
(2004), Hadjar and Beck. As stated by Hooghe,
In this view, primary socialisation experiences tend to
produce persistent effects, which are only marginally
influenced by later socialisation experiences. This
concept of persistent political self-identification is of
course nothing new, as it already was formulated in
Karl Mannheim's classical thesis on the creation of
"political generations" by what he called generation-
defining events. (p. 334)
Hadjar and Beck (2010) also clearly explain this relation-
ship between experiences of political crises and period effects:
Period effects are expressions of societal events,
political developments, value climate and societal
conditions, both on the structural and ideological level
that affect all birth cohorts in a specific country . . .
Causes of period effects may be very polarising election
Alaminos and Penalva 11
campaigns, the introduction of controversial laws,
unemployment, or a general distance from politicians
after political scandals. (p. 537)
It is important, in light of the discussion of concepts and
the findings presented in this work, to remain open to new
knowledge that is being incorporated to perfect this index.
The qualitative (specifically biographical) methodology
would improve knowledge of the phenomenon of CM and
how it connects with the socializing effect of the period lived
through (in the primary group or in the corresponding gen-
eration). Detailed knowledge of the phenomenon could put
an end to the confusion detected by various authors between
cause (elements that give shape to a potential mobilization)
and effects (mobilization at a specific time).

2. In Inglehart's (1990) studies, for the definition of Cognitive
Mobilization, the period effect is treated tangentially, because
it estimates that it is an effect that tends to be annulled in the
long term with the progressive incorporation of new cohorts.
He does consider it, however (introducing the temporal series
of inflation indexes), as an indicator that is close to his hypoth-
esis of scarcity. Inglehart concludes that although its influence
should be taken into account, differentiating between the three
effects (age, cohort, and period) is a very hard task.
