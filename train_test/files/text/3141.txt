Impact of Information Technology,
Clinical Resource Constraints, and
Patient-Centered Practice Characteristics
on Quality of Care
JongDeuk Baek1 and Robert L. Seidman1
Abstract
Objective: Factors in the practice environment, such as health information technology (IT) infrastructure, availability of other
clinical resources, and financial incentives, may influence whether practices are able to successfully implement the patient-
centered medical home (PCMH) model and realize its benefits. This study investigates the impacts of those PCMH-related
elements on primary care physicians' perception of quality of care.
Methods: A multiple logistic regression model was estimated using the 2004 to 2005 CTS Physician Survey, a national sample of
salaried primary care physicians (n ¼ 1733).
Results: The patient-centered practice environment and availability of clinical resources increased physicians' perceived quality of
care. Although IT use for clinical information access did enhance physicians' ability to provide high quality of care, a similar positive
impact of IT use was not found for e-prescribing or the exchange of clinical patient information. Lack of resources was negatively
associated with physician perception of quality of care.
Conclusion: Since health IT is an important foundation of PCMH, patient-centered practices are more likely to have health IT in
place to support care delivery. However, despite its potential to enhance delivery of primary care, simply making health IT
available does not necessarily translate into physicians' perceptions that it enhances the quality of care they provide. It is critical
for health-care managers and policy makers to ensure that primary care physicians fully recognize and embrace the use of new
technology to improve both the quality of care provided and the patient outcomes.

Care that is responsive to individual patient values and needs1 is
central to primary care in the United States and is a core com-
ponent of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model
that has become the centerpiece of health care delivery reform.2,3
Studies have found that provision of patient-centered care is
associated with higher patient engagement, satisfaction, and
reduced health care costs.4,5 Despite these benefits, implement-
ing patient-centered care can be challenging for primary care
teams, particularly within the context of the PCMH model.
Adopting a team-based, patient-centered approach often requires
significant changes to traditional patterns of interaction and can
be costly and time consuming for primary care practices.6,7
Factors in the practice environment, such as health informa-
tion technology (IT) infrastructure, availability of other clinical
resources, and financial incentives, may influence whether
practices are able to successfully implement the PCMH model
and realize its benefits. Health IT has the potential to facilitate
patient-centered care by improving care coordination and
enhancing patient­provider communication.8,9 However,
despite significant growth in health IT infrastructure over the
last decade, primary care physicians do not sufficiently utilize
health IT to ensure high-quality primary care.10,11 Although

some have shown that greater use of health IT can increase
physicians' ability to provide high-quality primary care in a
patient-centered environment,12 full realization of its potential
may require a stronger perception that IT improves both the
quality of care provided and the patient outcomes. This study
investigates the impacts of the patient-centered practice envi-
ronment and health IT use on primary care physicians' per-
ceived confidence in providing high-quality primary care.
The comprehensive research framework shown in Figure 1
illustrates how many PCMH-related elements are associated
with physicians' perception of quality of care.
Methods
This study analyzed data from the 2004 to 2005 Community
Tracking Study Physician Survey because it is the only large
national survey that includes measures such as practice policy,
medical care management, patient relationships, and physician
compensation.13 The sample consisted of salaried primary care
physicians, who have become more prevalent in primary care
delivery.14 A total of 1733 salaried primary care physicians,
who are board certified in family medicine, internal medicine,
or pediatrics, were selected.
Study Variables
Table 1 lists all variables included in this study. Appendix
A provides the original survey questions from which these
variables were defined.
Confidence in providing high-quality care. The outcome variable
was primary care physicians' self-assessed confidence in pro-
viding high-quality care. Instead of a highly specific outcome
measure that may be an unreliable or invalid proxy for actual
quality, this study used perceived quality of care by primary
care physicians, who are the appropriate persons to make clin-
ical decisions for patients. The dependent variable for this
analysis is based on recoding a self-assessed measure (1:
strongly disagree to 5: strongly agree) into a dichotomous vari-
able (strongly agree vs all other responses) to investigate
whether health IT contributes to the strongest perception of
quality care. The distribution of data for the original variable
did not allow for robust estimation of additional intervals.
Patient-centered practice environment. The patient-centered prac-
tice environment was defined using 4 items specific to the
interpersonal dimension between doctors and patients15: (1)
ability to maintain a long-term relationship with patients, (2)
spending enough time with patients during office visits, (3)
freedom to make clinical decisions in the best interest of
patients, and (4) clinical freedom to make decisions that meet
patients' needs. These 4 items are consistent with the widely
endorsed PCMH definition as ``a model of care that strengthens
the clinician-patient relationship by replacing episodic care
with coordinated care and a long-term healing relationship,
p.2.''16 They were averaged into a single score for the empirical
analysis.
Health IT use. Three types of IT functionalities were selected
that represent the core of meaningful use in clinical prac-
tice: clinical information access, e-prescribing, and

information exchange. The IT use for clinical information
access was based on 4 survey items measuring whether
physicians (1) obtain treatment alternatives or guideline,
(2) generate preventive service reminders, (3) access patient
notes and medication/problem lists, or (4) identify potential
drug interaction with other drugs, allergies, and other
patient conditions. E-prescribing was defined as the use of
IT systems to write a prescription regardless of the type of
system or the organization's IT capacity and included the
use of IT to (1) obtain information on formularies or (2)
write prescriptions. An additional dimension of IT use was
whether physicians exchanged patient information with (1)
other physicians or (2) hospitals or laboratories. Separate
variables were created for each of these 3 health IT dimen-
sions based on the number of IT functions used.
Resource/structural constraints and financial incentives. Other vari-
ables were created to control separately for constraints that may
influence physician's perceived quality of care. These variables
captured (1) the availability of supportive or referral resources,
(2) the degree to which physicians consider their patients' out-
of-pocket financial burden, and (3) constraints in prescribing
medications. Two additional variables measured the impact on
quality of care of financial incentives aligned with quality or
profitability of the practice.17
Physician age, gender, race, practice type, practice area,
foreign medical degree status, and the percentage of patients
whose primary language is not English were included in the
multiple logistic regression model to capture the independent
impact of these physician and practice characteristics on per-
ceived quality of care.

Results
Primary care physicians in this sample are generally younger
(36.5% younger than 40 years old), male (60.3%), and white
(73.9%). Family/general practitioners were the most frequently
reported specialty (39.7%), and the majority (83.5%) of physi-
cians practiced in a large metropolitan area (Table 2).
Approximately 38% of salaried primary care physicians
were strongly confident that they provide high-quality care.
The majority of physicians in the sample used some health
IT, with 87.1% using it to access clinical information, 59.7%
for e-prescribing, and 76.3% for information exchange. Physi-
cians generally believed their practice environment was
aligned with patient centeredness (mean ¼ 3.89), yet also per-
ceived several significant constraints to their practice, includ-
ing the inability to refer patients for specialty services (87.5%
reported many barriers). Over 60% of physicians also reported
basing practice decisions on the patient's financial burden and
facing constraints on ordering prescriptions (Table 3).
Logistic regression results suggest that physicians practicing
in a more patient-centered practice environment are more
likely to report providing high-quality care (odds ratio [OR]
¼ 4.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 3.37-4.91). When
compared to physicians who did not use any IT to access clin-
ical information, physicians who use 3 or 4 functions were
more likely to perceive that they provide high-quality care
(OR ¼ 2.01; 95% CI ¼ 1.19-3.39 for all 4 functions; OR ¼
1.58; 95% CI ¼ 1.01-2.51 for 3 functions). A similar positive
impact of IT use on physicians' ability to provide high-quality
of care was not found in e-prescribing or the exchange of
clinical patient information. In fact, physicians who used both
e-prescription functions were 39% less likely to be confident in
providing high-quality care compared to those who engaged in
no e-prescribing IT functions.
The physician financial incentive variables were not statis-
tically significant, suggesting that salaried primary care physi-
cians may not be sensitive to reimbursement incentives in
providing high-quality care. Physicians who faced major con-
straints in support of their clinical decisions were less than half
as likely to report providing high-quality care (OR ¼ 0.49; 95%
CI ¼ 0.30-0.78). Among physician and practice characteristics,
male physicians were 30% more likely than female physicians,
and internists were 35% less likely than pediatricians, to
believe that they provided high-quality care.
Discussion
Despite its documented benefits, a relatively small proportion
of salaried primary care in the United States is delivered using a
patient-centered approach.18-22 Greater adoption of a PCMH
approach in primary care could lead to more emphasis on pro-
vider partnerships, patient preferences, and communication,
resulting in increased quality of care.23 Physician decisions are
guided legally and ethically by the best interests of their
patients, so their perceptions of how certain factors influence
their ability to provide high-quality care are likely to be strong
predictors of whether they are interested in changing practice
behaviors.
The impact of health IT on physicians' confidence in pro-
viding quality of care was mixed in this study. The positive
impact of IT use to access clinical information on quality pri-
mary care is consistent with previous literature.24,25 However,
IT use for e-prescribing was negatively associated with high-
quality primary care. Although e-prescribing could enhance
medication safety,26 physicians have been critical of its useful-
ness in providing safety alerts27 and are also concerned about

the required time commitment for computing tasks rather than
spending time with patients.28 This may prompt physicians to
believe that e-prescribing does not enhance, and in fact may
distract from, their ability to provide quality care. Realizing the
full practice benefits of e-prescribing in primary care may
require careful attention in the transition to an e-prescribing
system to ensure that it is perceived as complementing a pri-
mary care physicians' workflow instead of generating more

problems that adversely affect the physicians' time or
practice.28,29
Current health reform emphasizes the importance of patient
information exchange among health-care providers and its role in
improving patient safety and the quality of care.30 Lack of a
significant related finding in this study may indicate that salaried
primary care physicians perceived little advantage to engage in
this or alternatively that exchange of patient information between
primary care physicians and hospitals or specialists is limited31,32
due to lack of data standards and interoperable systems33 or
possible physician resistance to changes in the care process.34,35
The significant findings for clinical IT access and lack of a
comparable result for other IT functions might also indicate that
physicians in this study may have been familiar with using health
IT simply to access patient information, including laboratory test
results and visit history, rather than exchanging patient informa-
tion with other providers or e-prescribing.
Previous studies on health IT have generally been limited to
just a few large health institutions and have focused on specific
health outcome measures.12 This study relies on a national
sample of physicians in different primary care practices and
includes different measures of IT adoption and use as well as
quality of care. Although we might expect physician age and
practice setting to be associated with IT use, neither factor was
estimated to have an independent impact even when each was
included in the model separately to avoid possible correlation
problems. Although IT adoption in primary care has increased
during the last decade, recent data still indicate a lower use of
health IT among primary care physicians.10,11 Our results have
managerial implications for primary care practices planning to
adopt or increase use of health IT systems. For example, access
to clinical referral services was negatively associated with the
perceived ability to provide high-quality care. Effective use of
these resources is critical to implementing a PCMH model of
primary care. This highlights the importance of aggressive and
proactive attention by administrators to maximize access to
these resources and ensure that physicians are trained in their
use and understand how they contribute to both improving
patient care and achieving the organization's mission.36
Several data and design issues may limit generalization of
this study's results. First, Health maintenance organization
(HMO) penetration in the health-care market was not controlled
explicitly.37 Although areas with greater HMO enrollment may
be more conducive to health IT use, the data did not permit
inclusion of this factor. However, factors that may be indirectly
related to HMO presence in markets, such as e-prescribing con-
straints and limitations in obtaining referral or clinical support
services, were included in the empirical analysis. Although this
study focused on IT usage behaviors regardless of the exact prac-
tice setting, there may have been a relationship between the type
of practice setting and the availability of IT use. Similarly, pri-
mary care physicians who did not use health IT may have faced
different practice policies or financial incentives compared to
those who made greater use of IT. An indirect attempt was made
to control for these possible impacts by including practice-
specific structural and contextual factors. The duration of
physician IT experience might also promote a more positive per-
ception of the value of IT in delivery of quality care. Unfortu-
nately, data on this factor were not available for this study. Given
evidence of limited e-prescribing adoption by primary care phy-
sicians prior to 2008 and38 the years of these data, only a minimal
impact on IT use would be expected. Finally, this study focused
on salaried primary care physicians, so the results do not neces-
sarily hold for nonsalaried physicians or those in other specialties.
Conclusion
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes a number of provi-
sions to promote PCMH and adoption of health IT in order to
reduce costs and improve care quality and patient outcomes.39
Since health IT is an important foundation of PCMH,40 patient-
centered practices are more likely to have health IT in place to
support care delivery. However, despite the potential to
enhance the patent-centered delivery of primary care, simply
making health IT available does not necessarily translate into
physicians' perceptions that it enhances the quality of care they
provide. If physicians perceive that any dimension of health IT
does not serve their (or their patient's) interests or fails to
contribute to providing high-quality care, they may tend not
to use it optimally or simply refuse to use it at all.
The PCMH implementation significantly alters the care envi-
ronment and practice of medicine by primary care physicians. It
is crucial for health-care executives and managers to address
challenges in PCMH transformation to ensure that physicians
understand how to utilize health IT and recognize how it may
improve health-care quality and outcomes instead of believing
that it reduces their connection with patients and detracts from
their ability to provide high-quality care. Providing more edu-
cation for physicians on the benefits of PCMH practice and the
effective use of health IT, including such strategies as identify-
ing physician champions, involving physicians in decision on
PCMH transition, and effective change management that
enhances organizational learning, may facilitate effective imple-
mentation of patient-centered practice in primary care.
Salaried practice environments tend to be those that are
larger where physicians may place a greater value on the avail-
ability of health IT. Even in these settings, the results of this
study indicate that several dimensions of health IT did not
positively impact the belief that using health IT strengthens
their ability to provide high-quality care. Physicians in differ-
ent settings may have even greater skepticism about the value
of health IT insofar as it affects their potential for better patient
relationships and the ability to provide quality care and may
also dramatically increase their costs and time commitment to
learn and use the technology. Given both the challenge for
technology adoption in small primary care practices and the
financial incentives to integrate more technology through
Meaningful Use and policies or incentives included in the
ACA, it is critical for health-care managers and policy makers
to ensure that primary care physicians fully recognize and
embrace the use of new technology to improve both the quality
of care provided and the patient outcomes.
