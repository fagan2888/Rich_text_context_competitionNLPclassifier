in Functional Status Among Elderly Persons

Datafrom the Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA) were analyzed to describe the heterogeneity offunctional status
transitions over 2-years (single-state model), and to explore whether changes in status in the previous two tofour year
period enhance the prediction of a subsequent transition (two-state model). Multivariate logistic regression with a ro-
bust estimate of variance was used to analyze a 7-category nominal response of:functional status (4 levels), institu-
tionalization, death, and missing. Weightedpercentages for functional status transitions and stability (unchanged sta-
tus) showed that unchanged or improvedfunctioning were at least as common as death or worsenedfunctional status.
Initial disability level, morbidities, and self-rated health were the strongest predictors of disability status after 2-years.
The two-state model revealed that a previous transition (positive or negative) increases the riskfor a subsequent transi-
tion, independent of initial disability level. The predictive and explanatory quality of the two-state model is substan-
tially improved over single-state models, particularly from its ability to identify subgroups of individuals with marked
functional status instability.
DISABILITY patterns among elderly persons provide key
information about the heterogeneity of burden in the
community from morbidity, in terms of loss of independence,
decreased life satisfaction and social isolation (Mor, Wilcox,
Rakowski, & Hiris, 1994), and in the level and duration of
health care service needs (Manton & Soldo, 1992).
Knowledge of the segways and longitudinal patterns in func-
tional status transitions is increasingly being sought by health
care planners to refine their risk assessment models developed
to manage disability in an epoch characterized by population
aging and health care reform. The challenge is that disable-
ment is a many varied thing. For some persons, disability may
occur late in life and progress rapidly to the point at which in-
stitutional care is necessitated or death occurs. For others, it
may produce a more dynamic pattern, with varying sequences
of fluctuations and reversals in disability interrupted by peri-
ods of stability (Guralnik & LaCroix, 1992). For example, in
population-based prospective studies, a considerable propor-
tion of disabled elderly persons report improved functioning
over periods of a few years to several years (Branch & Ku,
1989; Crimmins & Saito, 1993; Johnson & Wolinsky, 1993;
Manton, 1988b; Mor etal., 1994; Verbrugge, 1992).
It is known from epidemiological, demographic, and medi-
cal data that the linkages of major functional disability with
aging are often correlational but not causal. Aging is the venue
for the transitions of accumulated risk factor exposures to
functional impairments, and later to limitations in functioning
(Nagi, 1976). In large observational studies of elderly persons,
using periods of follow-up ranging from 2 to 6 years, ad-
vanced age is but one of many factors associated with risk for
disability and use of healthcare and community services
(Crimmins & Saito, 1993; Manton, 1988b; Mor et al., 1994).
Appreciable variability in disability is found for type of co-
morbidity, predispositional factors such as gender, and the in-
dividual's social resources. Morbidity holds a primary position
in the disablement process and has a complex association with
disability. The number of chronic diseases and illnesses is lin-
early associated with prevalent and incident disability (Fried
& Guralnik, 1997). The type of disease may produce different
patterns of functional disability (Buchner & Wagner, 1992;
Ettinger, Davis, Neuhas, & Mallon, 1994; Manton, 1989;
Verbrugge, 1992.). Other important predictors of disability
connected to disease and illness include current functional sta-
tus, and global self-rated health perception (Crimmins & Saito,
1993; Branch & Ku, 1989; Manton, 1988a; Mor et al., 1994).
Older-aged women have a higher prevalence of disability and
chronic disease, particularly cardiovascular diseases (Manton,
1988a), and survive longer than similarly disabled men
(Guralnik & Kaplan, 1989; Manton, 1989; Guralnik et al.,
1993; Rogers, Rogers, & Belanger, 1992). Family support,
and the availability of close social contacts during aging ap-
pear to prolong life (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988), and
promote health and adaptation to impairment processes result-
ing in more time spent in the community (Bradsher et al.,
1992; Mittleman et al., 1996).
While this body of work has been quite important in de-
scribing the heterogenous patterns in disability and need for
longterm care services in the community, a general limitation
has been the reliance upon a single time interval (single-state
model) to study transitions which are assumed to hold over
multiple time periods. Very little work has explored patterns of
disability over multiple intervals, such as in a two-state model
where an initial transition can be observed to effect transitions
in disability status in a subsequent period. As a result, there is
virtually no prospective information on the prognostic impor-
tance of functional status decline on subsequent disability, and
whether some subgroups of elderly persons have markedly
more functional status instability than others. Similarly, the
functional status prognoses of those observed with improved
functional status over an interval has not been well described.
The general limitations of single-state models was recognized
by Mor et al. (1994) in their own reliance on a six-year model
S17

for transitions. Documenting the dynamic variability in dis-
ability may provide important insight regarding the prognostic
importance of an initial decline on subsequent transitions and
could be useful in identifying risk for marked functional status
instability, such as sustained functional decline.
This study extends the disability literature by comparing
and contrasting prospective single-state and two-state func-
tional status transitions among elderly persons who partici-
pated in the Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA). Analyses
were undertaken to document increased precision possible in
predicting functional status in two-state models over single-
state models and to identify individual predictors of marked
functional status instability.
METHODS
Sample
Data for this study come from all four interview waves of the
LSOA. The LSOA is based on the 1984 National Health
Interview Survey, Supplement on Aging (SOA) conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics. The LSOA provided a
follow-up to the SOA to examine change in living arrange-
ments and functional limitations over time among elderly per-
sons who, based upon their age, were likely to experience
change in functional disability. Re-interviews were conducted
by telephone in 1986, 1988, and 1990 with 7,527 persons in the
SOA, or their proxies, who were 70 years and older in 1984
and living in a household residence at the time of the interview
attempt. Those without telephones were contacted by mail with
a self-administered questionnaire. Proxies were used for re-
spondents who were not available on the day of the interview,
most commonly from health impairments (Fitti & Kovar,
1987).
Due to budgetary constraints, the first LSOA re-interview
(1986) followed only 5,151 of the original cohort of 7,527
SOA participants. This sample was selected to include: all
SOA panel members 80 years and over; all persons of black
ethnicity ages 70 to 79; one-half of the remaining sample age
of 70 to 79 years; and all other persons age 70 to 79 who lived
in the same household as one of the above selected persons
(Kovar, 1989). In the remaining re-interview waves (1988 &
1990) attempts were made to contact each of the 7,527 SOA
participants. Thus, four waves of data collection were at-
tempted for 5,151 SOA respondents (Sample A), and three-
waves were attempted on 2,376 persons not re-interviewed in
1986 (Sample B). Because the focus of this paper relates to
functional status transitions observed over 2-year intervals
(i.e., 1984-1986, 1986-1988, 1988-1990), our analyses are
based only on Sample A, the four-wave sample.
The self-response rate in the initial LSOA survey was high,
requiring the use of proxy reports in approximately 8% of
households. In the subsequent re-interview periods, proxy re-
ports ranged from 31% to 36%. The data used in this study in-
cluded both that derived from self-reports and proxies. This
method was preferred because non-response may be related to
substantial declines in health and functioning, as reported in
the LSOA for mortality and level of disability (Kovar, 1989).
In addition, there is evidence from other sources suggesting
that proxy reports involving behaviors or health conditions
when the respondent is cognitively impaired or severely ill
(Rodgers & Herzog, 1989) may be advantageous over nonre-
sponse. In the latter cases, these proxy reports were judged to
be more precise and more stable over time than self-reports. In
the LSOA proxy respondents were chosen who could likely
provide reliable and accurate information; most lived within
the same household as the respondent.
Measures
Functional status was assessed by self-report from items re-
ferring to activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ac-
tivities of daily living (IADLs). ADLs represent common, ev-
eryday tasks required for self care (Katz et al., 1963) which, in
the LSOA, included the ability to: bathe/shower, dress, eat,
transfer, and use a toilet. IADL items capture a range of inde-
pendence more complex than ADLs (Lawton & Brody, 1969),
and represent less severe dysfunction than ADLs (Spector,
Katz, & Fulton, 1987). IADL items in the LSOA included: the
ability to prepare meals, shop, manage money, use a telephone,
do heavy house work, and do light housework. Similar to other
reports on functional status transitions (Manton, 1988b; Mor et
al., 1994) we created distinct categories of functional disability
based upon whether an individual was unable to perform the
specified activity. A respondent was classified as being (1) inde-
pendent: able to perform all ADL and IADL activities; (2)
IADL disabled only: unable to perform one or more IADLs but
had no ADL disabilities; (3) moderately ADL disabled: unable
to perform one or two ADL activities; and (4) severely ADL
disabled: unable to perform more than two ADL activities.
Competing risks to functional transitions include institution-
alization and death; hence, each was included as a possible
outcome in our 7-category response. Institutionalization infor-
mation was updated for each 2-year interval (LSOA interview
waves of 1986,1988 & 1990 as ascertained from a contact per-
son identified by the participant during the baseline interview).
Using a combination of LSOA information and results from
record matches with the National Death Index (NDI), deaths
were identified and assigned to the interview wave based on
date of incidence. This methodology has been shown to im-
prove the accuracy of identifying deaths in the LSOA com-
pared to using only NDI or LSOA information, and is de-
scribed in detail elsewhere (James, Miller, Anderson, Worley,
& Longino, 1997).
Covariates, modeled as baseline (1984 SOA interview) pre-
dictors of functional status transitions, included the respon-
dent's gender and race, and baseline values for age, living ar-
rangements, functional status, self-rated health, number of
illnesses, and comorbidity. The transition models (described
below) add updated information for age and functional status,
as time-dependent covariates. The respondents living arrange-
ment was measured from both marital status, and if unmarried,
whether living alone versus with others. This allowed us to in-
clude unmarried persons (e.g., widowed) who live with some-
one for assistance. Self-rated health was rated as excellent/very
good, good, or fair/poor. Participants with missing values for
the self-rated health item were combined with the fair/poor
category. The latter coding decision was consistent with the
LSOA documentation (1991) which stated that those not re-
sponding to self-report health questions were very old, ill, or
both. Self-assessed number of illnesses had a range of 0 to 10
(the highest level was truncated as 10 or more) and was treated
FUNCTIONAL STATUS TRANSITIONS S19
as a continuous variable. Based upon the work of Manton
(1989) and Verbrugge (1992) that transitions can depend upon
disease type (acute/fatal vs chronic/nonfatal), two classes of
comorbidity were investigated: cardiovascular diseases (CVD)
including coronary heart disease, stroke (or cerebrovascular
accident), hardening of the arteries, or angina pectoris; and
musculoskeletal diseases (MSD) including osteoporosis,
arthritis, or whether the respondent ever had a broken hip.
These disease groups have a high prevalence among older
adults in general and were reported to account for approxi-
mately 85% of all morbidities reported in the Long-term Care
Study (Manton, 1989). CVD was introduced as a disease
grouping likely to produce a relatively fast pace of functional
decline, while MSD was introduced as a disease likely to pro-
duce a relatively slow pace of decline. The CVD and MSD
classifications were constructed from 1984 self-reported preva-
lent health conditions. Note that comorbidity, self-rated health,
and number of illnesses were assessed only at baseline in the
LSOA and therefore reflect only the status reported in 1984.
Statistical Modeling
Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze a 7-
category, nominal response: 4 levels of functional status
(independent, IADL disabled, moderately ADL disabled,
severely ADL disabled), institutionalization, death, and oth-
erwise unknown status. Thus, each model adjusts the prob-
ability of functional status transitions for competing risks
from institutionalization, death, and having missing infor-
mation on status. Predictors considered in the models in-
clude variables representing previous functional status, age,
gender, race, self-reported health, CVD, MSD, number of
illnesses, marital status, and living arrangements (i.e., lives
with others versus lives alone). By including previous func-
tional status in these models, we are able to predict the
probability of transitions from precedent to antecedent
functional status states. Age, as measured in one-year incre-
ments in 1984, was parameterized in all models to estimate
a cross-sectional effect of age on the probability of the ob-
served transition. Change in age since 1984 was used to es-
timate the longitudinal effect of aging using parameteriza-
tions similar to those described by Laird, Donnelly, and
Ware (1992). Inclusion of this longitudinal aging effect is
equivalent to including a variable representing time from
1984 to the beginning of each two-year period in our mod-
els. Interactions between time (longitudinal aging) and pre-
vious functional status were explored to indicate whether
certain transition probabilities exhibited a pace of decay
which was specific to time under observation. A statistically
significant longitudinal aging interaction term would indi-
cate that the multiple 2-year time periods contain different
associations between covariates and functional transition
probabilities, and thus must be analyzed separately by in-
terval. Transition probabilities were estimated by regressing
end-of-period status on beginning-of-period status using a
parameterization representing all possible patterns of
change. This model was selected because tests of quadratic
and cubic orthogonal polynomial terms relating the two pe-
riod-statuses were highly significant (p < 0.0001), thus in-
validating the assumption of a linear effect associated with
the use of change scores.
Interaction terms were included in the models to investigate
the possible effect modifications between initial functional sta-
tus and each of the following covariates: gender, age, CVD
and MSD. Interactions between comorbidity status (CVD &
MSD) and time (longitudinal aging) were also explored to as-
sess the potential differential impact of these comorbidities on
functional status 2 versus 4 years later.
Generalized estimating equations, adopting the assumption
that repeated observations for a subject are independent of one
another, were used to estimate parameters in all models (Liang
& Zeger, 1986). A robust estimate of the variance of estimated
model parameters (Binder, 1993; Liang & Zeger, 1986) was
used to account for dependency within the primary sampling
units (PSUs) for the original SOA survey (Kovar, Fitte, &
Chyba, 1992). Because the PSU references the highest level of
clustering, with repeated functional status outcomes taken on
participants falling within single PSUs, this use of the robust
variance estimate also accounts for dependence between the
multiple measurements obtained for each participant (Korn &
Graubard, 1995). When there is no dependence between out-
comes within PSUs, these methods reduce to maximum likeli-
hood techniques.
All of the results presented were calculated with weights
that account for the unequal probabilities of selection and
non-response adjustments. Potential instability of the estima-
tion process resulting from multicollinearity of predictor vari-
ables was investigated by inspecting the bivariate correla-
tions between pairs of predictors and regressing each
predictor variable on all other predictor variables, thus deter-
mining how any single variable behaved in the presence and
absence of other variables in the model. This latter analysis
provided us with an indication of the percentage of variation
of each predictor that could be explained by all other predic-
tors. All variables chosen a priori for investigation were in-
cluded in the models except those which displayed multi-
collinearity with other covariates. Because marital status was
so closely related to living arrangements (alone versus with
others), we chose to retain the latter variable because of its
broader applicability to living arrangement types. Stability of
model parameter estimates and associated variances were in-
vestigated by: 1) fitting both single and two-state transition
models after entering each covariate solely into the model,
and 2) re-fitting our final model containing all covariates
multiple times, each time removing a single covariate from
all variables contained in the final model. All multivariate lo-
gistic regression models were fit using the MULTILOG pro-
cedure of SUDAAN (Shah, Barnwell, & Bieler, 1996). Re-
sults from these models are presented in terms of the odds
ratios (Agresti, 1990) for being in each of the seven end-of-
period outcome states relative to having no disability along
with their 95% confidence intervals.
As an illustration of odds ratios are obtained from the
multivariate logistic regression analyses, consider a model
using gender and race as predictors of our seven outcome
categories (independence, IADL disabled, moderate ADL,
severe ADL, institutionalized, death, missing). The models
that we fit use "Independent" as the reference category for
each of the logistic models that can be obtained from the
other response categories. For example, the logistic model
for White males relating the probability of being "IADL
S20 ANDERSON ET AL.

be specified as:
log (Pmb IADL disabled/ Prob Independence) = |i, + TC

where jx,, TG/
, and iR]
represent the intercept, gender effect,
and race effect, respectively, for this logit model. The ratio of
the odds of being "IADL disabled" relative to "Independent"
for men versus women, controlling for White race, is deter-
mined as follows:

)
Single-State Transition Models. -- Transition probabilities
for the 7-category nominal response described above were cal-
culated for two-year transitions considering the subject's func-
tional status state at the previous time point. For this model,
there were three, two-year periods available: 1984-1986,
1986-1988,1988-1990. For each period, respondents' func-
tional status was updated to reflect their reported condition at
the start of each two-year period. This was done to allow the
probability of a transition within the specified interval to be a
function of the most recent functional status information. Both
cross-sectional and longitudinal aging effects were included in
this model.
When modeling transition data, a general difficulty encoun-
tered is that some competing risks are considered to be absorb-
ing states, or conditions which essentially designate attrition
from the study, such as death. Institutionalization and missing
from follow-up can be temporarily absorbing states, as some
individuals later return to the community, are traced, or have
proxies to provide updated survey information. Persons with
missing data for one period remained active in the LSOA, and
in many instances (n = 317), had assessments completed in
subsequent LSOA reinterview periods. In our transitional mod-
els that use multiple periods of follow-up for each participant,
we included all participants that possessed covariate informa-
tion at the beginning, and outcome information at the end, of
each specific interval.
Two-State Transition Model. -- To explore whether the two-
year transitions in the single-state model might also be depen-
dent on the participant's functional status measured four years
prior, we used available data from the two, four-year periods
in the LSOA: 1984-1988 and 1986-1990. This model con-
tained the same covariables as those included in the single-
state, two-year transitional model, but also included functional
status measured four years prior as an additional predictor.
Thus, the probability of the two-year transitions between
1986-1988 and 1988-1990 are predicted, taking into account
changes in functional status in the previous two years. In this
model, if functional status measured two years prior is a sig-
nificant predictor, and functional status measured four years
prior is not, then this result favors a conclusion that the proba-
bility of being classified into functional states in 1988 or 1990
is only dependent on the functional status measured in 1986 or
1988, respectively. In contrast, if both prior functional status
measures are significant, then there exists evidence that the
two-year transition probability depends on functional status
measured both 2 and 4 years prior.

or widowed (other). Approximately one-third lived alone.
Between one-quarter and one-third reported having fair to poor
health; nearly one-quarter (23.9%) reported ever having one or
more CVD conditions; and more than one-half (55.9%) reported
ever having one or more MSD conditions. Nearly 30% had
some level of functional disability. These 1984 data are also pre-
sented for those who were alive and contacted at the beginning
at each LSOA re-interview wave (1986 & 1988) to show the im-
pact of attrition on sample characteristics. It is evident that attri-
tion from death, institutionalization or having unknown infor-
mation in the subsequent 1986 to 1988 period, resulted in the
loss of participants who: were men, were older, reported some
level of functional impairment, had proxy-reported information,
had CVD, or reported having fair-to-poor health.
Functional Status Transitions
Table 2 presents the weighted percentages for men and
women for aggregated 2-year functional status transitions
(1984-86, 1986-88, 1988-90). Death and institutionaliza-
tion at the end of the period sharply increased with more
severe disability at the beginning of the period 7.4% to
36.7%; however, men were more likely than women to die
at each level of disability. It is also evident that women re-
porting any level of disability (IADL or greater) were more
likely to have been institutionalized during the two-year pe-
riod than men. Considerable heterogeneity in functional
status transitions is evident. The weighted percentages of
men with improved status in 2 years, by level of disability
(IADL, moderate ADL, & severe ADL), ranged from 13.0
to 22.0 among men, and 14.2 to 21.1 among women. A
large percentage of persons were also classified with un-
changed status, for example: 28.2% of men and 32.6% of
women with severe ADL disability, and 21.4% of men and
28.3% of women with moderate ADL disability had un-
changed status. Taken together, having either unchanged or
improved functional status ranged from 46.8 to 64.0% for
women, and 41.2 to 64.8% for men. Not having functional
decline (e.g., same or improved status) was more common
than death and institutionalization at each level of disability
for women and men at all levels of functional status, except
severe ADL disability.
Predictors of 2-year Functional Status Transitions
Table 3 presents adjusted odds ratios (and 95% CI) from the
single-state, multivariate model predicting the combined 2 year
period transition probabilities. For each covariate, the odds are
specific for each competing outcome state, relative to being in-
dependent and adjusted for the effects of all other covariates
listed. After controlling for the level of functional status at the
previous interview (2 years prior), there was no longitudinal
aging effect. Additionally, we found no interaction between the
longitudinal aging effect and the previous functional status vari-
able (p = 0.357). Initial age, self-rated health, and level of func-
tional impairment were each strongly related to each of the five
outcomes shown in the Table. The pattern of odds ratios (OR)
for gender are consistent with unadjusted probabilities which
showed that men were less likely to have disability than women
(albeit the 95% CI for those with severe ADL includes 1.0), and
more likely to die. Whereas, the odds for women to be institu-
tionalized by the end of the interval is larger than for men ad-
justing for all model covariables. However, the 95% CI for this
odds ratio marginally included 1.0 and thus did not reach for-
mal statistical significance (p < .05).
An increasing level of disability was strongly associated with
having moderate or severe ADL disability, being institutional-
ized or having died. For those beginning the interval with some
disability, the odds of reporting worse functional status at the
end of the interval, relative to reporting independence, are much
greater than these same odds for persons reporting indepen-
dence at the beginning of the interval. This result is consistent
with the unadjusted, weighted percentages reported in Table 2,
where approximately 64% of persons reporting independence
at the beginning of the interval also report independence at the
end of the interval. Persons starting the period with moderate or
severe disability are quite unlikely to report independence at
the end of the interval. Thus, the odds ratios associated with
these two categories are quite large. For all levels of disability
except severe disability, stability is generally the most frequent
outcome, resulting in the large odds ratios for stable functional
status. Among those reporting severe disability at the beginning
of an interval, the odds for moderate disability, institutionaliza-
tion, and death are also quite large relative to the infrequent oc-
currence of a report of independence.

Finally, having poor self-rated health, and a self-reported
history of MSD or CVD, were strongly associated with greater
odds of being in a disabled state relative to independence.
Having MSD exhibited a trend (p > .05) toward being less
likely than those without MSD to become institutionalized or
to have died, relative to being independent. Interaction effects
between initial functional status and gender, age, MDS, and
CVD, as well as interactions between time (longitudinal aging)
and CVD did not reach statistical significance ofp < .05.
Our investigation of the sensitivity of our results to the pres-
ence of specific covariates found that the odds ratios for func-
tional status at the beginning of the period were affected by the
presence/absence in the model of either self-rated health or age
in 1984. When self-rated health or age were entered into a
model containing only the previous functional status variable,
the odds ratios for functional status decreased within a 10% to
30% range. Similarly, when either of these variables was
deleted from the final model containing all other covariates,
the odds ratios for functional status increased by similar per-
centages. The presence/absence of any other variables in the
model did not greatly impact the estimates for the functional
status variable. The presence of covariates decreased the vari-
ances of the functional status parameter estimates, relative to
the variances obtained from a model containing only the previ-
ous functional status variable. Thus, the large confidence inter-
vals present in Table 3 for several of the odds ratios represent-
ing the effect of previous functional status are primarily a
result of the data sparseness present in the cross-classification
of initial functional status and subsequent status two years
hence.
Finally, from our investigations of bivariate correlations, and
the amount of variation in any single covariate that could be
explained by all other covariates, we concluded that multi-
collinearity most likely did not pose a threat for estimation of
parameters in our multivariable model. In particular, our bi-
variate analyses indicated that the other covariates most highly
correlated with the variable representing previous level of
functional status were: self-rated health (r = 0.32), number of
illnesses (r = 0.26), presence of cardiovascular disease (r =
-0.24), presence of musculoskeletal disease (r = -0.18), and

age in 1984 (r = 0.28). The greatest correlation was between
the covariates representing the presence of CVD and the num-
ber of illnesses (r = -0.65). Among the remaining correlations,
the greatest correlations were between gender and whether the
participant lived alone (r = 0.32), self-rated health and the
number of illnesses (r = 0.28), self-rated health and the pres-
ence of CVD (r = -0.24), and the number of illnesses and the
presence of MSD (r = -0.22). All remaining correlations be-
tween covariates were smaller than ± 0.20. Using multiple re-
gression, we determined that the largest amount of total vari-
ability for any single covariate, that could be explained by all
other covariates, was for the number of illnesses, which was
46%. All covariates explained only 26% of the variability in
previous level of functional status.
Whether Previous Functional Status Predicts Subsequent
2-year Period Transitions
The weighted percentages for 2-state, 2-year functional sta-
tus transitions are shown in Table 4. These provide a compari-
son of the predicted transition probabilities associated with 2
years prior status, as stratified by 4 years prior status. These
data reveal patterns in functional status heterogeneity over
time, as presented graphically in Figures la and lb. Initial sta-
bility (unchanged statuses 4 years to 2 years prior) predicts
subsequent period stability (2 years prior to end-of-period sta-
tus). The probability of subsequent period stability diminishes
with increasing disability status 4 years prior. Among those
who were independent 2 years prior (Figure la), having had
severe ADL disability 4 years prior is associated with a sub-
stantially smaller probability of continuing to have indepen-
dent status than when only IADL disability is present 4 years
prior (i.e., 21.7 vs 43.5). Likewise, the probability of having
worsened status increases with increasing disability 4 years
prior. This same pattern is evident among those with IADL
disability 2 years prior (Figure lb.). Also evident in this pattern
is that persons who had improved functional status in the ini-
tial period (4 years to 2 years prior) have a much larger chance
of having continued worsening status than having either con-
tinued stability or improvement.
Table 5 presents the adjusted odds ratios and 95% CI for the
functional status variables when two previous states of func-
tional status, adjusted for all covariates listed in Table 3, are
used to predict subsequent status. The p-value for the term rep-
resenting functional status 4 years previous is highly signifi-
cant adjusting for the 2 years prior status (p < .0001), indicat-
ing that the predicted probabilities for groups defined by
functional status 2 years prior are refined to reflect their func-
tional status 4 years previous. The two-state model reveals
substantially more heterogeneity in functional status transi-
tions than does the single-state model. After accounting for
functional status obtained 4 years prior, the odds ratios ob-
tained for functional status obtained 2 years prior are consis-
tently smaller than those presented in Table 3 for the single-
state model. The significant odds ratios associated with 4 years
prior status indicate that the odds related to end-of-period sta-
tus associated with 2 years prior status depend upon the level
of disability reported 4 years prior. For instance, relative to
persons reporting independence at the end of the interval, the
odds that a person beginning the interval 2 years prior with se-
vere disability will complete the period as institutionalized are
83.22 times these same odds for a person beginning the inter-
val with independent functional status, controlling for 4 years
prior functional status. However, taking the same example, the
odds that persons who had severe ADL disability both 4 and 2

reporting independence both 4 and 2 years prior will complete
the period institutionalized.
Our investigations of multicollinearity for predictors used in
this model obtained results very similar to those described for
the single-state model. In addition, our investigation regarding
the sensitivity of our two-state modeling results to the presence
of specific covariates produced results almost identical to those
described for the single-state model. Only the presence of either
initial age or self-rated health in this model decreased the odds
ratios associated with the previous functional status variables.
DISCUSSION
Previous reports have documented the complex and dy-
namic nature of functional disability among elderly persons
(Branch & Ku, 1989; Manton, 1988a; Mor et al., 1994). A no-
table finding from the prospective models is evidence that the
process of functional change among elderly persons is not uni-
directional (Manton, 1988b). A substantial proportion of those
with disabilities will remain stable or actually improve over
time; many more will remain in the community with medical
and home care assistance irrespective of functional transitions.
Our study builds upon the literature by examining short- and
long-term patterns in disability by incorporating prior changes
in status using a two-state model to more fully observe the di-
versity in functional status transitions. To our knowledge, this
is the first report on functional transitions among elderly per-
sons using this approach.
Due to data sparseness in functional status transitions across
our 7-category outcome, we chose to combine all 2-year peri-
ods (for the single-state models), and all 4-year periods (for the
two-state models). Because this method assumes common ef-
fects for distinct time periods, we investigated for interactions

between periods and effects included in our models. Our testing
revealed no significant interactions, which supported our as-
sumption of common effects across intervals and provided evi-
dence that our updated measures of disability for each distinct
2-year period adequately captured the aging of the sample.
Consistent with findings reported by Manton (1989) from
the National Long-term Care Survey (LTCS), and Guralnik,
LaCroix, & Abbott, (1993) for the EPESE study, our single-
state model revealed a substantial percentage of subjects in the
LSOA initially with some degree of disability who reported ei-
ther the same level or lesser disability after two years. For ex-
ample, 21.3% of persons with moderate ADL disability had
improved status, while 13.8% of those with severe ADL dis-
ability had improved status. The likelihood of improving di-
minished for persons with severe ADL disability. In the LTCS,
more than 20% of persons with severe disability had improved
status. We note that the LTCS used a method of classifying
disability that was similar, but not identical, to ours, and that
the LSOA included a more aged cohort than the LTCS. Also
consistent with reports by these other investigators was our
finding of relatively high proportions of persons with moderate
to severe disability (IADL or greater) who reported the same
level of disability after 2 years (26.4% to 37.2%).
Our examination of transitions by gender revealed that
women had greater stability than men. Crimmins and Saito
(1993) studied transitions in LSOA participants who survived
the initial 2-year period, and had reported that women had less
deterioration of IADL and ADL functional statuses. Our re-
sults demonstrate that women as a group have better outcomes
at each initial disability level. Thus, considering functional sta-
tus, from the single-state model men and persons moderately
ADL disabled appear to have the highest risks for a change in
status over 2 years. Men were more likely to die, and also sub-
sequently, men who remain in the community appear to have
less disability than women. Women, however, appear more
likely to be institutionalized than men, perhaps a consequence
of their better survival with disability (Manton, 1990). Persons
who lived with others at the beginning of the period had higher
odds for being severely ADL disabled and lower odds of being
institutionalized during the period.
Independent of initial functional status and all other vari-
ables considered, each of the health status measures signifi-
cantly predicted the outcomes studied. Variables representing
the presence of musculoskeletal-related morbidity (MSD) and
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were constructed to capture
these highly prevalent forms of morbidity associated with dis-
ability among elderly persons (Fried & Guralnik, 1997). MSD
was included to exemplify a slow, progressive disease, while
CVD exemplified a faster-paced disease which may have more
importance in predicting disability over relatively short time
intervals. While we found, as others have (Crimmins & Saito,
1993; Guralnik, et al., 1995; Manton, 1988b), that having
MSD and CVD related diseases is associated with greater dis-
ability, there were no distinct patterns in disability risk between
morbidity groups with the exception of a trend for persons ever
having CVD, to be more likely to become institutionalized
than those without CVD (however, the 95% CI for the odds in-
cluded 1.0). The interaction effects between CVD and MSD
with time were non-significant. Thus, we did not find evidence
that declines with CVD occur at a faster pace than with MSD
that was predicted by Manton and Soldo (1992) from cross-
sectional data from the LTCS. Verbrugge and colleagues
(1992) found arthritis was associated with less death and insti-
tutionalization than non-arthritic illnesses over a 2-year period
in the LSOA. However, our model used a different morbidity
categorization and controlled for baseline perceived health sta-
tus and number of illnesses. In a more extensive analysis (data
not shown), we found that over a 6 year interval functional sta-
tus declines associated with having MSD appeared slower than
with CVD. This was evidenced by larger odds for having
IADL disability (OR=1.44 vs 1.15) and moderate ADL dis-
ability (OR=1.61 vs 1.26); the lower bound of 95% CFs for
these estimates was above 1.0 for the odds only with MSD.
Thus, in our study, only when we allowed for appreciable attri-
tion from mortality over a longer time period did a differential
pattern of disability emerge by disease type.
General health status has also been shown to predict disabil-
ity and mortality among elderly persons (Borawski, Kinney, &
Kahana, 1996; Fried & Guralnik, 1997; Mor et al., 1994). An
increase in the number of illnesses from the LSOA list of
prevalent conditions was associated with increasing odds for
death. Reporting perceived health status as either "excellent/
very good" or as "good" versus "fair/poor or missing" was
strongly associated with less disability and a smaller probabil-
ity of death and institutionalization in the period, adjusting for
all other covariates. Subjective appraisals of health in the
LSOA, as in other large epidemiological studies, are robust
predictors of functional transitions and mortality (Kaplan &
Camacho, 1983; Wolinsky & Johnson, 1992) and capture both
psychological well-being, general physical illness states, and
levels of disease severity which may be more crudely captured
by diagnostic categories.
The central contribution of our study to the literature on
functional transitions was our test of the two-state model.
Combining reinterview information on functional status from
several 2 -and 4- year periods, we demonstrated that the proba-
bility of functional transitions is dynamic. Specifically, proba-
bilities based on status 2 years prior is dependent upon disabil-
ity 4 years prior. Information from a previous state,
incorporated with that from a recent state, significantly refines
models of disability risk. This study builds upon the work of
Wolinsky and colleagues (1993) who first demonstrated that
functional health status between two time points was signifi-
cantly associated with later period institutionalization and
death. Our two-state models for functional transitions were de-
rived from all 2-year and 4-year time periods to overcome the
problem of data sparseness given the sample size and transi-
tion events in the LSOA. Still, in many cases the odds ratios
and 95% confidence intervals become large, and we must cau-
tiously interpret trends in the data when the confidence inter-
vals just include 1.0.
The 2-year transitions obtained in the LSOA revealed con-
siderable and statistically significant heterogeneity based upon
status 4 years prior, and using two time periods resulted in im-
proved discrimination of functional transitions over single-
state models. Wolinsky and colleagues (1993) similarly found
that two-state models more precisely predicted nursing home
placement. An unanticipated finding was that an initial transi-
tion in functioning involving improved status (as well as an
initial decline), can bode for subsequent decline. This suggests
S26 ANDERSON ET AL.
that, for some elderly persons, even positive transitions may
signal general instability rather than processes underlying re-
covery or vitality as is implicitly assumed in the literature (e.g.,
Manton, 1989; Verbrugge, 1992). Future research should more
closely examine this occurrence, and more broadly identify
covariates of a previous functional decline which modify the
risk of subsequent transitions using data inclusive of lifestyle
factors, health promoting practices, and post-hospitalization
health care. Much of this information is not available in the
LSOA. We also need to learn more about not only how to pre-
vent declines, but also how to lengthen the rebounds from
functional loss by promoting healthy lifestyles and timely
health care.
Our study has some potential limitations. First, there is little
data in the literature on the reliability of functional status infor-
mation over time in the circumstance when there has been no
change in status. This measurement property has not been
quantified in the LSOA; however, we assume that this error is
random, and, hence, diluted the precision of our estimates and
our ability to observe patterns in functional transitions. The use
of proxy reports for functional status information when the re-
spondent was too sick or otherwise unable to complete the
LSOA interview may have resulted in systematic error. There
are too few conclusive studies documenting costs and benefits
of using proxy reports in gerontological studies (Moore, 1988;
Rodgers & Herzog, 1989), and some have found proxy reports
to be more reliable then respondent reports (Rodgers &
Herzog, 1989). Several factors argue against removal of prox-
ies in the LSOA (Crimmins & Saito, 1993). Since the most
common reason for proxy reports was respondents' physical
and mental impairment, eliminating the latter would seriously
jeopardize the representativeness of the sample data. Most
proxy reports of functional status information in the LSOA are
provided by persons living within the household of the respon-
dent, and who are thus capable of providing quality informa-
tion. Another caveat of our results is that our measurement
scale for disability compared three hierarchical levels of dis-
ability, which differentiated between IADLs and ADLs com-
mon in gerontological research (Weiner et al., 1990). However,
recent scaling work with these measures (Fitzgerald, Smith,
Martin, Freedman, & Wolinsky, 1993; Johnson & Wolinsky,
1993; Rueben, Laliberete, Hiris, & Mor, 1990) have shown
that ADLs have a more complex structure, such as a cognitive
component and advanced activities and further, that some do-
mains of ADLs have differential predictive validity for transi-
tion, such as nursing home placement and mortality. Thus, ad-
ditional insight on risk for functional status instability in
two-state models may be gained by examining these different
dimensions of ADLs. We also could not examine subsequent
period outcomes associated with adaptation to functional dis-
ability, per se, and in the context of impairment. Hence, it is
uncertain whether those with reported improved status, yet
higher risk for subsequent declines, have inherent health insta-
bilities patterned as cycles of recovery and recurrent illness
episodes, or whether short-term, yet appreciable, gains in func-
tioning were realized from adaptations to disability. Successful
adaptation to disability may result in gains in functioning,
lengthening the time spent without severe disability. The
effectiveness of adaptations may also be hypothesized to vary
by disease type. With acute life-threatening diseases, such as
severe CVD, adaptation might produce relatively small gains
in subsequent period functioning as compared to the gains pos-
sible from slower paced chronic diseases, such as arthritis, for
which gradual declines in functional status over time from dis-
use may be substantially avoided (Buchner & Wagner, 1992).
The considerable plasticity in functioning is intriguing from
a health care and policy perspective. There appears to be a
residual potential that at least some of the variability observed
may be affected by early interventions aimed at maintaining
functioning in older adults, and to sustain improvements in
functioning with timely interventions. Models which identify
those who are at highest risk for instability may require func-
tional status information from more than one time interval.
