Introduction
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a hormonal cascade
in control of cardiovascular and renal functions that control
arterial pressure, fluid and electrolyte balance.1 Traditionally,
RAS is thought to be initiated by renin-mediated cleavage of
angiotensinogen (AG) to form the decapeptide angiotensin I
(Ang I), which is metabolized to the octapeptide angiotensin
II (Ang II) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).2­4
Although the existence of RAS has been known for more
than five decades, recent advancements in cell and molecular
biology have improved the understanding of the role of this
system in normal and diseased states.1,5 Many authors have
described that local/tissue RAS are present in many tissues
such as the brain, heart, peripheral blood vessels, adrenal
glands, and kidneys, and are able to operate in an autocrine,
paracrine and/or intracrine manner and exhibit multiple
physiological effects at the cellular level that add to and/or
differ from the circulating RAS.6­8

Abstract
Introduction: Tonin is an enzyme that is able to generate angiotensin II (Ang II) from angiotensin I (Ang I) or directly
from angiotensinogen. Our goal was to characterize the renal renin-angiotensin system in transgenic mice that express
rat tonin (TGM`(rTon)).
Materials and methods: Mice were euthanized and the kidneys removed for analysis. Tonin activity was evaluated
by radioimmunoassay and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity by HPLC. Tonin, ACE and angiotensin II-
converting enzyme (ACE2) expression was analyzed by Western blotting.
Results: Tonin activity was significantly increased in TGM`(rTon) compared to their respective wild-type (WT) littermates
(1.7 ± 0.21 vs 0.11 ± 0.02 nmol of Ang II/min/mg of protein). Tonin activity had a strong positive correlation with tonin
expression in both TGM`(rTon) and their respective wild-type littermates. The ACE activity and expression levels of 65-
kDa N-domain angiotensin I-converting enzyme isoform were significantly increased in the TGM`(rTon) when compared
with WT. ACE2 expression levels were statistically significantly higher in the TGM`(rTon) when compared with WT.
Angiotensin 1­7 (Ang(1­7)) and Ang I levels were significantly lower in the TGM`(rTon).
Conclusions: We suggest that the environment of tonin abundance may increase N-domain ACE activity liberated by
a secretase able to cleave somatic ACE.

Studies have demonstrated alternative pathways forAng
II formation involving proteinases other than renin and
ACE and have been observed in several species, including
humans.9­11 In tissues, including blood vessels, brain, heart,
and adipose tissue, it is possible to generate Ang II directly
from AG, independently of renin and ACE. It has been pos-
tulated that chymase, cathepsin G and tonin are part of
alternative enzymatic pathways for Ang II production.12­14
Tonin (rat kallikrein 2, rKLK2) is a serine proteinase
present in several rat tissues, such as the brain, kidney,
prostate, and mainly in the submandibular gland.15­20 Tonin
releases Ang II from peptides presenting the sequence cor-
responding to the N-terminal portion of AG like Ang I and
tetradecapeptide (AG(1-14)),13,21,22 the synthetic renin sub-
strate. There is evidence that tonin plays a role in blood
pressure control23 and participates in the local hydromin-
eral balance in several sites.24 Intracerebroventricular injec-
tion of tonin induces salt appetite and water intake and
increases urinary volume and blood pressure.16
Tonin was described as an Ang II-releasing enzyme,
therefore, since its discovery, tonin has been studied in
order to verify its participation in the pathophysiology of
hypertension. Some studies have shown that tonin may be
involved in the genesis and maintenance of hypertension.
Initial studies show that: (a) the activity levels of tonin in
the plasma are increased in humans with essential and ren-
ovascular hypertension; (b) infusion of tonin intravenously
in mice does not alter blood pressure; however, in indo-
methacin salt-treated rats a marked increase in arterial
blood pressure was observed under tonin infusion; (c) a
single intravenous administration of rabbit antiserum tonin
into one-kidney one-clip hypertensive rats restored blood
pressure to normal in seven out of 10 animals. The authors
suggest that tonin is important in the maintenance of high
blood pressure. However, other factors, possibly prosta-
glandins and sodium, have to be modified in order to acti-
vate the tonin-Ang II system.25
Cardiovascular and electrocardiographic parameters
after tonin administration were recently evaluated in
Wistar rats. The authors observed that tonin is able to gen-
erate Ang II in the isolated heart, and the cardiovascular
response induced by tonin was completely blocked by can-
desartan, an indication that the action of Ang II on the AT1
receptor is the major mechanism of the heart effects.26
In order to clarify the importance of tonin for the car-
diovascular system, Cardoso et al. (2010)27 generated
transgenic mice that express rat tonin, the TGM(rTon).
These mice present high levels of tonin messenger RNA
(mRNA) and activity specifically in the brain. As a conse-
quence, TGM(rTon) develop increased blood pressure and
water intake. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is less hypoten-
sive for TGM(rTon) than for control animals. The AT1
receptor antagonist candesartan equally lowers blood pres-
sure in transgenic and in control mice. Plasma Ang II is
increased in TGM(rTon) as compared to the wild type. AT1
receptors are desensitized in this transgenic model.
Cardoso and collaborators concluded that tonin in the
brain may represent an alternative pathway to generate
Ang II with effects on the cardiovascular system.27
Recently, our group generated a second lineage of
transgenic mice (TGM`(rTon)) that also express rat tonin
in many tissues of cardiovascular importance. More
recently, our group demonstrated for the first time that the
systemic antinociceptive effects in the TGM`(rTon) are
blocked, at least in part, by losartan and A-779, suggesting
that Ang II produced in these transgenic mice may be
involved with antinociception via the AT1
receptor, while
Ang(1­7) induces its effects via the Mas receptor.28 The
aim of the study was to characterize the RAS in the kidney
of transgenic mice overexpressing rat tonin.
Material and methods
Production of TGM`(rTon)
Transgenic TGM`(rTon) mice were obtained by microin-
jection of the transgene into zygotes as described by
Cardoso et al. (2010).27 Total RNA was extracted from the
submandibular gland of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats using
Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's proto-
col.AfterreversetranscriptionwithM-MULV(Invitrogen),
tonin cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) in the presence of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and
specific primers (59-ACC TGA TAC CAT GTG GCT
CC-39 and 59-CAT GGT GGG TTT TAT TGA GAC-39).
The product was cloned into the pGEMT vector (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) and sequenced using an automated
DNA sequencer. The rat tonin cDNA (0.83 kb) was sub-
cloned into the pBluescript II SKq vector (Stratagene, La
Jolla, CA, USA) downstream of a 2.2-kb fragment con-
taining the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
gene promoter, previously removed from the plasmid
pCAT-2 using KpnI and XbaI. A 0.6-kb fragment contain-
ing the SV40 polyadenylation site was excised from the
plasmid pDLux with XbaI and cloned downstream of the
rat tonin cDNA. All cloning junctions were confirmed by
sequencing with specific internal primers (59-CAG CCG
TGA TCA CCC AG-39 and 59-CGA GAC TGG CCA
GGA GGT GC-39). The transgene was cleaved from the
construct using ScaI, BglII and NdeI, and transgenic ani-
mals were generated by the pronuclear microinjection
method.29 C57BL/6 mice were used as zygote donors. The
presence of the transgene in mouse genomic DNA was
verified by PCR using primers that anneal to exon 3 (59-
AGG TGG TGT GAA GGT TAT CG-39) and exon 4 (59-
CCT CCT TCC ATC TCT CCT GC-39) of the tonin gene.
Homozygous transgenic mice TGM'(rTon) were gener-
ated and maintained by breeding. Transgene expression
driven by the human GFAP promoter was not limited to
the brain of TGM`(rTon) animals (Table 1).

Animal protocols
Studies were performed using tissues obtained from adult
male 10- to 12-week-old wild-type controls (WT, C57
black six) and TGM`(rTon). Animals were maintained on
a normal diet, with free access to tap water with a 12:12-
hour light-dark cycle with food and water ad libitum.
Animals were euthanized by decapitation and kidneys
were immediately removed and stored at -80°C until
experiment procedures. Experimental protocols were
approved by the Experimental Animal Use Committee of
the Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil (Protocol
0241/08).
Tonin activity
TGM`(rTon) (n = 4) and C (n = 4) were euthanized, kid-
neys removed and homogenized in 250 mM sucrose
buffer (pH 7.0) containing: 10 mM ethylenediaminetet-
raacetic acid (EDTA) (metalloprotease inhibitor), 10 mM
o-phenanthroline (metalloprotease inhibitor), 10 mM
dipyridyl (metalloprotease inhibitor), and 10 mM sodium
tetrathionate (cysteine protease inhibitor). After centrifu-
gation, a fraction of the supernatant was incubated at
37°C with 5 µg of synthetic substrate of renin, tetradeca-
peptide (AG(1­14)) in 0.1 mol/l sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 6.8) containing the inhibitors described above. The
Ang II liberated in the incubation medium was deter-
mined by radioimmunoassay as described by Gualberto
and colleagues (1992).18 The detection assay limits were
in picomolars and the results were expressed as specific
activity as nanomol of Ang II liberated/minute/milligram
of protein.
Renin activity
Kidneys were homogenized (TGM`(rTon) (n = 10) and C
(n = 9)) in 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing: 1 µM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (serine protease
inhibitor), 10 mM EDTA (metalloprotease inhibitor) and 1.5
mM o-phenantroline (metalloproteases inhibitors).After cen-
trifugation, a fraction of the supernatant was incubated (20 µl)
at 37°C for 10 minutes with 1 nmol of synthetic renin sub-
strate, tetradecapeptide (Porcine) in a final volume of 1 ml of
50 mMTris/HCl buffer in the presence of inhibitors described
above. Aliquots were collected at zero time (control assay)
and 10 minutes later, the reaction was stopped by addition of
orthophosphoric acid 10% (10 µl). The AG(1­14) was quan-
tified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy (HPLC). Products of reaction were separated on a
reversed-phase columnAquapore ODS 300, 250 × 4.6 mm, 7
 (PerkinElmer's Browlee Columns) using isocratic gradient
for five minutes followed by 20 minutes of linear gradient
from 5% to 35% mobile phase B (95% acetonitrile in 0.1%
H3
PO4
), under a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min for 40 minutes.
Peptides were identified by comparing the retention times
with that of standard peptides. Detection limits of the renin
assay were nanomoles order per milliliter. The results were
expressed in nanomol per minute and milligram of tissue.
ACE activity
TGM`(rTon) (n = 10) and C (n = 8) were euthanized, kidneys
rapidly harvested, rinsed and homogenized in 0.4 M borate
buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.34 M sucrose and 0.9 M NaCl (1
g tissue: 10 ml buffer) in the presence of 100 mmol/l PMSF
(serine protease inhibitor), as described by Oliveira and col-
leagues (2000).30 The homogenates were centrifuged at 3000
× g, at 4°C for 10 minutes and the supernatant frozen at -80°C
until experimental use. ACE activity was determined fluori-
metrically as described by Friedland and Silverstein (1976).31
A tenfold diluted aliquot (10 l) of the supernatant was incu-
bated for 10 minutes (37°C) with 100 mmol/l borate buffer
(pH 8.3) in the presence of 300 mmol/l NaCl and 0.1 mmol/L
ZnSO4,
containing Z-Phe-His-Leu (Z-PHL) (1 mmol/l) or
Hippuryl-His-Leu (HHL) (5 mmol/l). The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 280 mmol/l NaOH (1.5 ml) and
incubated with o-phthaldialdehyde dissolved in 20 mg/ml in
methanol (100 l) for 10 minutes. The fluorescent reaction
was stopped by the addition of 3N HCl (200 l). The liberated
dipeptide HL was measured fluorimetrically (360 nm excita-
tion and 500 nm emission) using a Hitachi Spectrophotometer
F2000 (Hitachi, Japan). Detection limits of the ACE assay
werenanomolesorderpermilliliter.Theresultswereexpressed
in milliunits (specific activity) per milligram of tissue.32
Angiotensin quantification
Kidneys (TGM`(rTon) (n = 7) and C (n = 7)) were homoge-
nized in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.2 containing

240 mM sucrose, 300 mM NaCl and the proteinase inhibitors:
1 mM EDTA(metalloprotease inhibitor), 1 µM o-phenanthro-
line (metalloprotease inhibitor), 120 µM pepstatin A (aspartyl
protease inhibitor), 1 µM PMSF (serine protease inhibitor) and
1 mM 4-chloromercuribenzoic acid (cysteine protease inhibi-
tor) at a ratio of 5 ml of buffer per gram of tissue. Homogenate
was centrifuged at 20,000xg for 40 minutes at 4°C. The sam-
ples were concentrated in C18 Sep-Pak column previously
activated with methanol (5 ml), tetrahydrofuran (5 ml), hexane
(5 ml), methanol (5 ml) and water (10 ml).After activation, the
samples were applied to the columns, washed with water and
eluted in ethanol/acetic acid/water in the proportion (90:4:6).
After elution the material was lyophilized and suspended in
500 l of buffer A (5% acetonitrile in 0.1% orthophosphoric
acid). The peptides were separated using the HPLC System
(Milton Roy, USA). Synthetic standards were used (Sigma,
USA) and peptide detection was carried out at 214 nm. The
angiotensins were identified by comparing them with the
retention time of standard peptides and results were expressed
in picomol per gram of tissue.32
Western blotting
Electrophoresis was performed on a polyacrylamide gel
(7.5%) in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as
described by Laemmli (1970)33 using 40 g of denatured
and reduced protein, which was dissolved in 30 l of sample
buffer. Electrotransfer was performed for 45 minutes at con-
stant voltage (40 V) using a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio
Rad, USA). The membrane was incubated in a 5% non-fat
dry milk blocking solution for one hour before overnight
incubation at room temperature with specific antibody for
ACE (Chemicon International, USA, diluted 1:2000),ACE2
(R&D Systems, USA) and tonin.15 The subsequent steps
were performed with the streptavidin/phosphatase alkaline
system (GE Healthcare, Sweden). Color development was
performed using nitro blue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-
3-indolyl-phosphate (NBT-BCIP) complex as recom-
mended by the manufacturer (Bio Rad, USA). The -actin
levels were determined in all samples and used to normalize
the expression levels of enzymes32 (TGM`(rTon) (n = 4) and
C (n = 4)).
Morphological examination in the kidney
The kidneys (TGM`(rTon) (n = 4) and C (n = 4)) were
excised fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-
buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin and serially cut
from the apex to the base. A transverse section (5 mm) was
collected every 0.8 mm and six to eight sections were
obtained from each kidney. Sections were stained using
hematoxylin and eosin and digitalized. We observed 30
glomeruli in each group. Measurements were restricted to
glomerulus that showed in a single cut, and at least one of
the poles: vascular or urinary. We calculated the diameter
of the glomerular tuft and space between Bowman's cap-
sule and tuft (external area ­ internal area of the Bowman's
capsule). Scanned images were then obtained through a
microscope (Leica DM 1000) coupled with a digital cam-
era. The images were analyzed using the Ipwin program.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Data were com-
pared by unpaired Student's t-test. A value of p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Enzymatic activities
Tables 1 and 2 present the results of specific activity of
tonin, ACE and renin in the kidney. Tonin, renin and ACE
activities were significantly higher in TGM`(rTon) com-
pared to WT. The ratio between Z-PHL and HHL was
higher in TGM`(rTon) when compared to WT (1.89 vs
1.34 mU/mg, respectively), indicating higher levels of
ACE N-domain isoform activity in transgenic animals.
Angiotensins levels
Figure 1 shows the levels of angiotensins in the renal tis-
sue of TGM`(rTon) and WT. Results demonstrated that the
levels of Ang(1­7) (87.89 ± 13.35 vs 1112.00 ± 96.14
pmol/g for TGM`(rTon) and WT, respectively) and Ang I
(71.66 ± 8.88 vs 135.80 ± 18.20 pmol/g of tissue for
TGM`(rTon) and WT, respectively) were significantly
decreased in TGM`(rTon). Ang II levels were significantly
increased in TGM`(rTon) (126 ± 10.81 pmol/g of tissue)
compared to WT (77.91 ± 8.81 pmol/g of tissue).
Western blotting

expressed as relative scan units, confirms that there was a
significant increase (p < 0.05) in tonin expression levels in
TGM`(rTon) (5.54 ± 0.08 vs 3.74 ± 0.4 for TGM`(rTon)
and WT, respectively) (Figure 2(a) and (b)). Figure 3(a) and
(b) show the expression levels of the ACE isoforms with
190 (somatic) and 65 kDa (N-domain ACE isoform) in the
kidney of TGM`(rTon) and WT. The 65 kDa isoform ACE
expression levels are lower than the 190 kDa isoform in
renal tissue in both groups. Expression levels of the 190
kDa isoform are significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the
TGM`(rTon) (sr = 3.90 ± 0.23) when compared to WT (sr =
2.20 ± 0.22). However, the presence of rat tonin influenced
the expression of 65 kDa isoform between the groups
TGM`(rTon) and WT (sr = 2.25 ± 0.16 vs 1.20 ± 0.18,
respectively). Figure 4(a) and (b) shows the expression lev-
els of the 90 kDa ACE2 in the kidney are significantly
higher in the transgenic mouse when compared to WT (sr =
0.19 ± 0.07 vs 0.37 ± 0.08 for WT and TGM`(rTon),
respectively).
Morphological analysis
Morphological analysis of the mice renal tissues from
TGM`(rTon) mice showed alterations in the glomerular
tuft diameter (42.92 ± 1.32 vs 52.55 ± 1.38 µm for
TGM`(rTon) and WT, respectively) (Figure 5). But, no
alteration on Bowman's capsule space was detected
(526.70 ± 44.10 vs 523.3 ± 41.7 µm2 for TGM`(rTon) and
WT, respectively).
Discussion
Given the lack of information regarding tonin in RAS, the
present work investigated the role of tonin in renal RAS in
animals TGM`(rTon). We observed in summary an increase
of tonin, renin and ACE activities, a reduction of Ang(1­7)
and Ang I with an increase in Ang II levels in the kidney of
TGM`(rTon) when compared to control animals.
In this model renal renin activity was increased, but
Cardoso and colleagues (2010) described that systemic lev-
els of renin in TGM(rTon) are not statistically different.27
The focus of our work was to study RAS in the kidney.
The early controversy on the novel concept of tissue RAS
has been based on the question of local synthesis vs uptake
from the circulation.8 Thus, it has been difficult to deline-
ate the quantitative contributions of systemically delivered
vs locally formed Ang peptides.34 These potential auto-
crine-paracrine systems may be important in the regulation
of local tissue functions in addition to the circulating endo-
crine system.35 An independent function of local RAS (for
example, in the brain where the RAS components are also
expressed in regions inside the blood-brain barrier) has
been postulated.8
Evidence suggests that local formation is of major sig-
nificance in the regulation ofAng levels in many organs and
tissues. It is necessary to understand the mechanisms
responsible for independent regulation of the intrarenal
RAS vs circulatory RAS of the development and mainte-
nance of hypertension and renal injury.34 Local synthesis of
renin may be limited to very small amounts, but uptake of
renin from the circulation is very likely.36 Our results in the
kidney taken together with the observation made by Cardoso
et al. (2010)27 suggest the existence of a possible dissocia-
tion of circulating and renal RAS in this animal model.
These transgenic animals produced an environment
with significantly increased levels of Ang II. Ang II plays

an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology
of the renal tissue.2 Ketteler and colleagues (1995) sug-
gested that Ang II damages the kidney by increasing glo-
merular filtration pressure, whereas autocrine transforming
growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) overexpression occurs
from unidentified mechanisms. Recent studies reveal that
Ang II is a potent inducer of TGF-beta synthesis in a vari-
ety of cells and that this mechanism exerts important bio-
logical effects including extracellular matrix accumulation,
cell proliferation, and hypertrophya.37 Histomorphometric
analysis revealed a decrease in the glomerular tuft diame-
ter, without changes in space of Bowman's capsule of
TGM`(rTon). These changes may be related to increased
Ang II and TGF-beta effects, which contribute to the for-
mation of renal fibrosis.37
The decreased levels of Ang(1­7) in TGM`(rTon) can
be attributed to modulation of the N-domain ACE isoform
in these animals whose activity and expression are
increased. N-domain ACE cleaves Ang(1-7), considered a
specific substrate for the N-domain ACE active site of the
somatic, as well as for the soluble (65 kDa) N-domain
ACE isoform.38 Yamada et al. (1998)39 reported that the
hydrolysis of Ang(1­7) by ACE to form Ang(1­5) appears
to be an important pathway for inactivation of this pep-
tide.40,41 Possibly, alternatives pathways have contributed
to the low levels of Ang(1­7), mainly through the action of
N-domain ACE on this peptide in the kidney. Ang(1­7) is
a specific substrate for N-domain ACE, which is found in
the mesangial, proximal and collecting duct cells.42 Despite
the increase of ACE2 activity, possibly the N-domain ACE
activation found in TGM'(rTon) is responsible for the pep-
tide degradation. Further studies are necessary to under-
stand the modulation of these enzymes.
The expression of ACE2 is increased in young diabetic
rats and has a renoprotective role by increasing the intrare-
nal levels of Ang(1­7).43 In the kidney, Ang(1­7) reduces
fluid absorption, induces diuresis, natriuresis, inhibits
Na+-K+ATPase, and enhances the vasodilator effect of
bradykinin (BK).44­46 In our model, the decrease ofAng(1­
7) may not facilitate the vasodilator effects of Ang(1­7)
and cause renal damage, but we did not detect morphologi-
cal alterations in the kidney in histological analysis.
Ang I levels in renal tissue of TGM'(rTon) were statisti-
cally lower than in control animals, although renin activity
was higher in this group. Ang I is also a substrate for ACE2,
a carboxypeptidase enzyme and homologue of ACE,
expressed predominantly in the kidney, heart and blood ves-
sels, that produces Ang(1­9). We did not measure the ACE2
activity in the kidney; however, its protein expression is sig-
nificantly increased, indicating that it may be involved in
Ang I degradation. ACE2 has a high affinity for Ang II to

form Ang(1­7), which is also formed by the action of ACE
on Ang(1­9).47,48 Possibly the degradation of Ang I can also
result from the action of ACE, due to high levels of activity
and protein expression found in this study. As described in
the literature, ACE3,4 and/or tonin13,21,22 pathways may con-
tribute to the low levels ofAng I. The low levels ofAng I can
also be explained by the activation of other enzymes, includ-
ing the neutral endopeptidase (NEP), which is found in tubu-
lar and glomerular epithelial cells.49,50 This endopeptidase is
also an important element of the intrarenal RAS, since it
mediates the conversion of Ang I to Ang(1­7).
Indeed, Bauer et al. (1999)51 demonstrated that the kid-
ney has a remarkable capacity to degradeAng I andAng II,
considerably higher than that in the pulmonary and sys-
temic circulation. They also concluded that the ability of
the kidneys to convert circulating Ang I to Ang II (21%) is
of minor importance for endocrine generation of Ang II
but could be useful for the paracrine production.
Recent studies have revealed intratubular conversion of
Ang II to Ang III by amino peptidase A.52 These data show
the complexity of RAS tissue, indicating that more studies
are needed to better understand the action of this system.
Results obtained in this study show increased activity
of the N-domain isoform, in both groups, in renal tissue.
This was confirmed by the increase of the protein expres-
sion of N-domain ACE in the transgenic group. Higher
levels of activity and protein expression of N-domain ACE
observed in renal homogenate suggested that in
TGM`(rTon) the modulation of this isoform may occur,
probably through the activation of proteinases capable of
releasing it. Secretases, sheddases or convertases are able
to cleave somatic ACE from the membrane-bound form,
generating a soluble form of the protein that has properties
either identical to or subtly different from those of the
membrane bound.53 Recently our group identified and
purified secretases described as serine proteinases able to
liberate N-domain ACE isoform in mesangial cells related
especially to hypertension.54
We suggest that the environment of tonin abundance
may increase N-domain ACE liberation in the transgenic
mouse by a secretase described as a serine protease and
its activity, explaining the low levels of Ang(1­7) in its
specific substrate.42 This environment may also activate
other pathways or cell signaling or alter the gene expres-
sion of different peptides or enzymes in order to main-
tain corporal homeostasis. Taken together, our data show
the role of tonin as an important modulator of renal RAS.
Despite some studies having described important phys-
iological effects of tonin, the physiological role of this
enzyme remains unclear. We have made some progress
toward a more precise definition of tonin-Ang II's role as
part of this amazing but still puzzling system of Ang
II-generating enzymes. Most knowledge to date on tonin
comes from rodents and the presence of tonin in human
tissues has not been clearly reported.
