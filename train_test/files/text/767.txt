Background. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between religious activities and cigarette
smoking in community-dwelling older adults.
Methods. Cigarette smoking and religious activities were assessed in a probability sample of 3968 persons age 65
years or older participating in the Duke Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) survey. Partici-
pants were asked if they currently smoked, if they ever smoked, and how many cigarettes per day they smoked. Atten-
dance at religious services, participation in private religious activities (prayer or Bible study), and use of religious
media (religious TV or radio) were also assessed. Data were available for Waves I--III of the survey (1986, 1989, and
1992). Analyses were controlled for age, race, sex, education, alcohol use, physical health, and in the longitudinal anal-
yses, smoking status at prior waves.
Results. Cross-sectional analyses revealed that participants who frequently attended religious services were signifi-
cantly less likely to smoke cigarettes at all three waves. Likewise, elders frequently involved in private religious activ-
ity were less likely to smoke (Waves II and III). Total number of pack-years smoked was also inversely related to both
attendance at religious services and private religious activities. Watching religious TV or listening to religious radio, on
the other hand, was not related to smoking at Waves I and II nor to total pack-years smoked, but was postively related
to current smoking at Wave III. Among those who smoked, number of cigarettes smoked was inversely related to fre-
quency of attendance at religious services (Wave I), private religious activities (Wave III), and religious TV/radio
(Waves II and III). Retrospective and prospective analyses revealed that religiously active persons were less likely to
ever start smoking, not more likely to quit smoking.
Conclusions. Religiously active persons are less likely to smoke cigarettes, and if they do smoke, smoke fewer
cigarettes. Given the association between smoking and disease, and the widespread prevalence of both smoking and
religious activity, this finding has implications for public health.
CIGARETTE smoking is a common behavior in the
United States, where over 25% of the population
smokes regularly (1). Most persons begin smoking during
their youth and continue this behavior into adulthood. Peo-
ple continue to smoke not only because of preference or
habit, but because they become dependent on nicotine
which is more addictive than alcohol, marijuana, or cocaine
(2). Although age is inversely related to cigarette smoking,
and 34% of persons aged 65 or older have quit, between 12
and 20% of older adults continue to smoke regularly (1,3).
Cigarette smoking causes an acceleration of the aging pro-
cess of the lung and a loss of lung reserve (4). The inci-
dence of lung cancer, now the leading cause of cancer
death in both men and women in the United States, is about
10 times higher in smokers compared with nonsmokers
(5,6). Smoking has also been associated with increased
cancer of the larynx (7,8), tongue (8), pharynx (8), esopha-
gus (8), pancreas (9), and cervix (10), and has been related
to leukemia and myeloma (11), hypertension (12), and
coronary artery disease (13). In fact, almost 50% of the dif-
ference in mortality rate between the sexes in the United
States can be accounted for by smoking alone (14). Cessa-
tion of smoking by older adults, on the other hand, is asso-
ciated with a rapid reduction in pulmonary and cardiovas-
cular morbidity and mortality (15).
Religious belief and activity are also important to many
older Americans. Recent Gallup Polls and Barna surveys
indicate that 53% of persons age 65 or older attend reli-
gious services at least weekly, over 60% read religious
scriptures during a typical week, and 90% pray (16,17).
Consequently, it is not surprising that nearly 75% of older
adults report that religion is "very important" to them (16).
In fact, participation in church or synagogue activity is
more common in later life than all other forms of voluntary
social activity combined (18). When health problems pre-
vent older adults from attending religious services, per-
sonal religious activities like prayer, Bible study, or reli-
gious media viewing may become particularly important
(19,20). Religious beliefs and practices, in turn, may im-
pact health and health behaviors (21).

RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES AND CIGARETTE SMOKING M427
Religious groups have long instructed members on what is
permissible with respect to diet, hygiene, exercise, and alco-
hol, drug, or tobacco use (22). Examples include Kosher
laws that regulate diet and hygienic practices for Jews (23),
John Wesley's teachings concerning health practices among
Methodists (24), and prohibitions concerning alcohol and
cigarette smoking by Mormons and Seventh-Day Adveritists
(25). Although other groups such as Catholics, Episco-
palians, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and Baptists promote no
specific health practices as essential for membership, each
tradition encourages behaviors that enhance health and well-
being and discourage use of substances that adversely affect
the physical body ("a temple of the Holy Spirit") (26).
The initiation and maintenance of cigarette smoking dur-
ing the teen years is strongly influenced by the smoking
behavior of both parents and peers (27). Active religious
participation at that time might reinforce negative attitudes
toward use of tobacco and enhance social pressure to avoid
smoking. As expected, higher levels of religious belief and
activity have been associated with lower rates of tobacco
use in adolescence and young adulthood (28-32). Thus,
persons who are religiously active during their early years
may never acquire the smoking habit and therefore may be
spared many smoking-related diseases later in life.
A number of studies have now demonstrated lower rates
of certain types of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, respira-
tory diseases, and overall mortality in Mormons (33) and
Seventh-Day Adventists (34), findings that have been ex-
plained at least in part by smoking behavior. Greater reli-
gious activity or commitment has also been linked with
lower rates of smoking among young adult African Ameri-
can women (35) and adults in New Zealand (36) and the
U.S. (37,38). No study, however, has examined the rela-
tionship between cigarette smoking and religious activity in
persons age 65 and older in the United States. We expect
certain forms of religious activity, particularly organized
religious activity, to be associated with lower rates of
smoking in older adults, many of whom may receive much
social support from members of the religious community
(18,39). Private religious activities like prayer or Bible
study, being reflective of greater religious commitment,
might also be associated with lower rates of smoking. More
passive religious involvement, however, such as religious
TV viewing or radio listening, may have less of an effect
on such behavior.
In the current study, we examine religious behaviors and
cigarette smoking in a random sample of 3,968 older adults
living in North Carolina. North Carolina is located in an
area of the United States where religious activity is preva-
lent. Likewise, a relatively large proportion of the popula-
tion smokes cigarettes, and the tobacco industry continues
to be an important contributor to the state's economic well-
being, as it has been for many years. Thus, a high rate of
both cigarette smoking and religious activity in this loca-
tion makes it an ideal setting to study the religion-smoking
relationship. In addition, the multiwave nature of this study
enables the examination of how religious activity influ-
ences smoking behavior over time.
We hypothesize that (a) increased frequency of religious
activity will be associated with lower rates of current and
previous cigarette smoking (particularly among elders who
frequently attend religious services and pray or study the
Bible); (b) among those who currently smoke, the number
of cigarettes smoked per day will be lower among those
who are more religiously active; (c) greater religious activ-
ity will be associated with cessation of smoking in the past,
and (d) religious activity at earlier waves will predict lower
rates of smoking at later waves.
METHODS
The sample consisted of participants in the three in-per-
son interviews (henceforth referred to as Waves I--III) con-
ducted as part of the National Institutes of Health spon-
sored Establishment of Populations for Epidemiologic
Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) project, Duke University
site. Subjects were identified for the initial interview (Wave
I) using a four-stage stratified probability sample of persons
from five contiguous counties (one urban, four rural) in
central North Carolina. In the first stage, 450 primary sam-
pling units of approximately equal population size were
selected from the survey area. In the second stage, one list-
ing area was selected from each sampling unit. In the third
stage, all households in a listing area were enumerated and
a certain number were randomly selected from this list. In
the fourth stage, the Kish method (40) was used to select a
person age 65 or older from each eligible household (per-
sons were identified not by letter or telephone call but by
knocking on doors). Approximately half of the final sample
came from the urban county and the rest from the rural
ones. Because one of the original study aims was to exam-
ine black-white differences, blacks were oversampled.
In this manner, 5,223 eligible persons were identified;
4,162 persons (80% response) completed Wave I in-person
interviews in 1986. Of these, 162 proxy interviews were
excluded from the present analysis, leaving 4,000 partici-
pant interviews. Data on both smoking and religious activi-
ties were available on 3,968 respondents who formed the
Wave I sample for this report. Wave II took place in 1989
when 3,336 in-person or proxy interviews were conducted;
664 subjects were not reinterviewed because they.had either
died (three quarters), refused, or were lost to follow-up.
Data were available on both cigarette smoking and religious
activities for 3,152 subjects, the Wave II sampie for this
report. Wave III took place in 1992 when 2,568 in-person or
proxy interviews were conducted; the remaining 1,432 par-
ticipants had either died (80%), refused, or were lost to fol-
low-up. There were data on both cigarette smoking and reli-
gious activities for 2,396 subjects, the Wave III sample.
Measures
In-person interviews were conducted by trained research
assistants. Included, in the survey was information on par-
ticipants' demographic characteristics, religious activity,
and denomination, health status, and health behaviors
(smoking and alcohol use).
Demographic variables.--Age (years, as a continuous
variable), sex (male - 6; female =1), race (white = 0, black
= 1), education (years, as a continuous variable), and reli-
gious denomination were measured at Wave I.
M428 KOENIG ET AL.
Religious activity.--Religious activities measured at each
wave included frequency of attendance at religious meet-
ings or services (measured on a six-point scale, from never
to more than once a week), frequency of prayer, meditation
or Bible study (measured on a five-point scale, from never
to daily or more often), and frequency of watching religious
TV or listening to religious radio (six-point scale ranging
from never to more than once a week). For categorical
analyses, response options were combined to reduce the
number of categories and ensure adequate cell size for anal-
ysis; for other analyses (e.g., correlations), response cate-
gories were left in continuous form.
Physical health.--Different religious activities are known
to be either less common (church attendance) or more com-
mon (private prayer/Bible reading) among those in poorer
health, and cigarette smoking is known to have adverse
health effects (41). The health measure used in this study
was based on the presence of five physical conditions at
Wave I: heart problems, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and
cancer (42). For each condition (e.g., level of hypertension),
36 physicians provided ratings to indicate its impact on
physical health (43). Physician raters were faculty or fellows
in the Division of Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Duke
University Medical Center; all had extensive experience
with elderly adults. When a condition was present, a respon-
dent was given a score equal to the mean physician rating
for that condition. These scores were summed across condi-
tions to form a continuous variable (other analyses not
shown here indicate that the effects of having multiple phys-
ical illnesses are probably additive, but not multiplicative).
For categorical analyses, the variable was dichotomized at
the midpoint of its distribution in the population (good
health = 0, poor health = 1); for other analyses (correla-
tions), it was left as a continuous variable.
Health behaviors.--Cigarette smoking was determined at
each wave by the following questions: (a) "Do you smoke
cigarettes regularly now?"; (b) if no, "Did you ever smoke
cigarettes regularly?" (Wave I); and (c) "On the average
how many cigarettes per day did you [or do you] usually
smoke?". Number of "pack-years" was also determined for
current or former smokers at Wave I. Participants were
asked how old they were when they first began smoking and
how old they were when they last smoked cigarettes regu-
larly. The number of years the subject smoked was then
multiplied by the average number of packs of cigarettes
smoked per day (20 cigarettes per pack) during that time.
Alcohol use is known to correlate with both smoking
(44) and religious activity (45). In this study, alcohol use
was determined at each wave by asking the following ques-
tions: "Have you had any beer or ale during the past year?";
"Have you had any wine during the past year?"; "Have you
had any liquor in the past year?". Answering "yes" to any
of these questions indicated alcohol use.
Statistical Analyses
Sample weights were used to adjust the sample distribu-
tions for probability of selection within households of vary-
ing sizes, to adjust for biases due to nonresponse, and to
match the demographic characteristics of the five county
area determined by the U.S. Bureau of Census (particularly
necessary because blacks were oversampled). All statistical
analyses and percentages, unless otherwise noted, were
weighted; numbers of subjects (Ns) were actual numbers,
not weighted numbers. Cross-tabulation was used to exam-
ine the distribution of smoking status (yes/no) by level of
religious activity. For categorical outcomes, two-step logis-
tic regression was used to examine the association between
smoking status and each religious variable. First, the reli-
gious variable was examined alone in the model; second,
the covariates age, sex, race, alcohol use, education, and
physical health were added to the model to control for their
effects. Odds ratios were obtained from the logistic regres-
sion procedures. For analyses predicting future smoking
status (e.g., Wave I religious activity predicting Wave II
smoking status), smoking status during the previous wave
(e.g., Wave I) was included in the model (residualized
change analysis). For continuous variables (number of
cigarettes smoked per day or number of pack-years), Pear-
son correlation was used for bivariate comparisons. Partial
correlation was then used to partial out the effects of age,
sex, race, education, alcohol use, and physical health.
RESULTS
Table 1 gives the characteristics of participants at each of
the three waves of the survey. Median age at the baseline
evaluation was 73 years; about two thirds of the sample
were women and over 50% were black (due to oversam-
pling). The effects of dropouts were quite small, although
there was a trend towards less alcohol use, decreased cig-
arette smoking, and increased private religious activities
from Wave I to Wave III among participants remaining in
the study. In general, frequency of religious activities
tended to remain stable during the six-year follow-up
period; there was no evidence for greater religiousness
among those who died or dropped out.
Hypothesis 1
Increased frequency of religious activity will be associ-
ated with a decreasedfrequency of smoking. This hypothe-
sis was supported for attendance at religious services and
private religious activity such as prayer or Bible study but
not for religious TV or radio. Religious service attendance
was significantly related to smoking status at all three
waves (Wave I attendance vs Wave I smoking, Wave II
attendance vs Wave II smoking, and Wave III attendance vs
Wave III smoking) (Figure 1 and Table 2). These associa-
tions persisted after controlling for age, sex, race, educa-
tion, alcohol use, and health status. Persons who attended
religious services at least once a week at Wave I were 25%
more likely not to smoke cigarettes at Wave I than those
who attended less frequently (odds ratio 1.25, p < .0001).
Frequency of private prayer and Bible study was related
to smoking status at Waves II and III, but not at Wave I.
Unlike attendance at religious services and private religious
activities, however, religious TV watching or radio listen-
ing was unrelated to smoking status--except at Wave HI,
where it was positively related (e.g., persons who watched
religious TV/radio frequently were more likely to smoke).

Frequency of Attendance at Religious Services
Figure 1. Attendance at religious services and cigarette smoking by
older adults (n= 3968).
Next, the association between smoking status and four
combinations of religious attendance and private prayer/
Bible study were examined at Wave I. Dummy variables for
"high-high," "low-high," "high-low," and "low-low" atten-
dance-prayer combinations were created and included along
with the six covariates in a logistic regression model predict-
ing smoking status. Subjects who both attended religious ser-
vices and prayed or studied the Bible frequently (high-high
category, n = 1329) were almost 90% more likely not to
smoke than persons who attended services infrequently and
prayed or studied the Bible infrequently (low-low category,
n = 923) (odds ratio 1.88,/? < .0001).
Pack-years smoked.--To examine the association be-
tween religious activities at baseline and overall life-time
exposure to cigarette smoking, we examined the total num-
ber of pack-years smoked. Frequency of attendance at reli-
gious services was inversely related to number of pack-
years smoked by both current and former smokers (r =
-.18, p < .0001, n = 3793) (Figure 1). This association
remained significant after controlling for age, sex, race,
alcohol use, years of education, and health status (partial
r = -.15, p<. 0001,n = 3654).
Private religious activity, such as prayer or Bible study,
was also inversely related to pack-years smoked (r = -.16, p
< .0001, n = 3704), although controlling for covariates weak-
ened the association (partial r = --.04, p < .05, n = 3565). The
average pack-years smoked by persons who rarely or never
engaged in private religious activities was 25.7, compared
with 12.5 pack-years among those who prayed or studied the
Bible once per day or more. Although frequency of religious
TV or radio listening was inversely related to pack-years (r =
-.12, p < .0001, n = 3785), the association disappeared when
covariates were controlled (partial r = -.01, n = 3646).
Hypothesis 2
Among those who smoke, the number of cigarettes per
day will be lower among the more religiously active. This
hypothesis was supported for all three types of religious
activity (Table 3). Among those who smoked, attendance at
religious services was inversely related to number of cig-
arettes smoked at each wave, but only the Wave I analysis
retained statistical significance after other covariates were
controlled. Private religious activity was also inversely
related to number of cigarettes smoked at each wave,
although the association retained its significance after con-
trolling for other covariates only at Wave III. Religious TV
or radio listening, on the other hand, was more consistently
related to cigarettes smoked. This activity was inversely
related to number of cigarettes smoked at all three waves,
and associations at Waves II and III retained their signifi-
cance when other covariates were controlled.
Hypothesis 3
Greater religious activity will be associated with cessa-
tion of smoking in the past. To explore the relationship

status).
between religious activities and cessation of smoking, we
reexamined associations at Wave I this time with three cate-
gories of smokers: never smoked, smoked but quit, and cur-
rent smokers. There were 2,190 participants who had never
smoked cigarettes, 1083 who had smoked previously, and
688 who were currently smoking.
Comparing participants who attended religious services
one or more times a week with those who attended less
than once a week, we found that frequent attenders were
more likely to have never smoked (57.8% vs 46.5%), about
as likely to have quit smoking (29.9% vs 30.6%), and less
likely to be currently smoking (12.3% vs 23.0%) (p < .001,
after controlling for the six covariates using multinomial
logistic regression). Participants who engaged in daily
prayer or Bible study were more likely to have never
smoked (59.9% vs 44.2%), less likely to have quit smoking
(26.3% vs 35.4%), and less likely to be smoking now
(13.8% vs 20.4%) (p < .05, after controlling for covariates).
Those watching or listening to religious TV or radio at least
once a week were also more likely to have never smoked
(55.1% vs 47.2%), were less likely to have quit smoking
(28.0% vs 35.0%), and were about as likely as less frequent
viewers to be currently smoking (16.8% vs 17.8%) (p <
.05, after controlling for covariates). Thus, in this retrospec-

tive analysis, greater religious activity was primarily related
to never having smoked, rather than to the cessation of
smoking (although, because highly religious people were
more likely to never smoke, a smaller proportion of them
were at "risk" for smoking cessation).

Greater religious activity at earlier waves in the survey
will predict lower rates of smoking at later waves. By Wave
II (1989), 44 persons not smoking at Wave I (1986) began
to smoke and 129 persons smoking at Wave I stopped
smoking. By Wave III (1992), 30 persons not smoking at
Wave I began to smoke and 151 persons smoking at Wave I
stopped smoking. We examined the ability of religious
activity at Wave I to predict smoking status at Waves II and
III, using logistic regression to control for smoking status at
Wave I, age, sex, race, education, alcohol use, and health
status; the same was done for religious activity at Wave II
predicting smoking status at Wave III.
Attendance at religious services and religious TV/radio
activity at Wave I and Wave II were weak and nonsignifi-
cant predictors of smoking status at Wave II and Wave III
(Table 2). Private religious activity at Wave I, on the other
hand, was a significant predictor of smoking status at Wave
II. Persons who prayed or studied the Bible more often at
Wave I were more likely than other participants not to
smoke cigarettes (either stop or continue not to smoke) at
Wave II; this effect weakened by Wave III and did not
replicate for Wave II private religious activity predicting
Wave III smoking status. Subanalyses revealed that private
religious activity was primarily related to continuing not to
smoke (odds ratio 2.00, p = .04) rather than to smoking ces-
sation (odds ratio 1.15, p- .53).
DISCUSSION
Cigarette smoking is the principal cause of preventable
disease and premature death in industrialized countries
throughout the world. Cigarette smokers, taken as a whole,
have a 30-80% higher death rate than nonsmokers, with
most of the excess mortality due to coronary heart disease
and lung cancer (46). In the present study, we found that
older adults who frequently attended religious services or
engaged in private religious activities like prayer or Bible
study were significantly less likely to smoke cigarettes, and
if they did smoke, smoked fewer cigarettes per day than
less religiously active elders. Those who both attended reli-
gious services at least once a week and prayed or studied
the Bible at least daily were almost 90% more likely not to
smoke than persons less involved in these religious activi-
ties. Participants more likely to pray or study the Bible at
Wave I were also significantly less likely to be smokers at
Wave II. Although religious TV or radio activity was unre-
M432 KOENIG ET AL.
lated to or positively related to cigarette smoking, those
who smoked and frequently watched or listened to religious
media programs smoked fewer cigarettes per day than other
smokers. Thus, all three forms of religious activity mea-
sured here were related to less overall cigarette smoking.
Durkheim (47) emphasized the socially integrative aspects
of religious participation, and how social influences from a
religious group may contribute to the development of per-
sonal identity and consequently affect behavior. Religious
groups model prosocial behaviors, and as we noted earlier,
may have proscriptions against the use of addictive or physi-
cally harmful substances. Religious practice offers the person
an opportunity to form social bonds with others who share
positive beliefs concerning health and health habits. This pro-
cess likely begins in adolescence or early adulthood, when
socialization experiences within religious settings may be par-
ticularly powerful in preventing the onset of tobacco use.
Futhermore, older adults who participate in religious
activities may cope better with stress and therefore experi-
ence less of a need to depend on tobacco use. Cigarette
smoking has increasingly become a marker for deprivation
(48), a stressful lifestyle (49), neuroticism (50,51), and is
associated with consumption of other drugs and alcohol
(48,52). In contrast, studies have demonstrated lower rates
of depression (38,53-55), anxiety (56), and alcohol abuse
(38,57) for persons who are more religiously involved. The
positive association between current cigarette smoking and
religious TV/radio activity may be relevant in this regard.
Other reports have found that persons who frequently
watch or listen to religious TV or radio have poorer physi-
cal health and may be more troubled in a variety of ways
(41,56), perhaps making them more prone to smoking
(analyses in the present study, though, were adjusted for
physical health). We have hypothesized elsewhere that pas-
sively watching religious TV programs or listening to reli-
gious radio programs may not have the health benefits of
more active religious participation (41).
Interestingly, the lower rates of cigarette smoking among
religiously involved elders in this study did not appear to be
due to a higher rate of smoking cessation but rather to never
having smoked. This emphasizes the importance of religious
activity in terms of disease prevention, particularly because
the negative health effects of smoking tend to be cumulative
and relate to total exposure to cigarette smoke over a life-
time (46). If religious involvement can help prevent the
onset of smoking in adolescence and young adulthood
(28-32), it may have considerable impact from a public
health perspective. A lower smoking rate among the reli-
giously active can also help explain the lower overall mor-
tality of this group in general (58-61) and their lower death
rate from cardiovascular diseases (62-64) in particular.
To get a better sense of the impact that smoking might be
having on the health of study participants, we examined the
effects of being a smoker at Wave I on mortality over the
next six years (1986-1992) controlling for age, sex, and edu-
cation using Cox proportional hazards regression. Dates of
death were confirmed using death certificates. As expected,
smokers were over 50% more likely to die than were non-
smokers (hazard ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.33-1.78, p < .0001).
Thus, we would anticipate that lower rates of smoking
among religiously active elderly persons is likely to have
substantial health benefits.
Limitations
Although the findings from this study include longitudi-
nal data suggesting that religious activity at one point in
time can influence smoking behavior 3 years later, these
results were not as robust or as consistent as were the cross-
sectional associations. This makes statements about reli-
gious activity "causing" lower rates of smoking quite tenta-
tive. An alternative explanation could be that cigarette
smoking has a negative impact on participation in religious
activities. It is also possible that other unmeasured variables
could account for the associations between religious activity
and smoking observed here. Nevertheless, the size and con-
sistency of the associations, the similar results reported by
other investigators examining different populations and age
groups, and the clear rationale for the presence of such asso-
ciations, argue for the validity of these results.
Lack of an objective measure of smoking status may have
also affected the results of this study, because religious per-
sons may have minimized the amount they smoked. The
major focus of the EPESE survey, however, was not about
religion. The few questions pertaining to religion were imbed-
ded in a questionnaire with literally hundreds of other ques-
tions about health and social activities, which was adminis-
tered by trained secular interviewers. Furthermore, given the
widespread knowledge of smoking's effects on health and the
health of others, there is probably a general tendency to mini-
mize reports of smoking (65). We are aware of no data, how-
ever, that suggest that religious persons are intrinsically less
honest about their habits than nonreligious persons.
Finally, the generalizability of our findings may be lim-
ited by the geographic location of the study in the Bible
Belt region of the United States, where religious activities
are part of the social fabric of society and over 60% of the
population is Baptist. Over one half of our sample attended
religious services at least weekly, prayed, or read the Bible
at least daily, and three quarters watched religious media
programs at least once a week or more. As noted before,
however, older Americans tend to be quite religious in gen-
eral (16,17).
Future Research
Future studies are needed to clarify what specific aspects
of religious activity are responsible for the inverse relation-
ship with smoking. Is it the social aspects of religion, the
personal commitment to religion, or the specific content of
religious belief that primarily fuels this relationship? For
example, it may be interesting to compare a group of
agnostic elderly persons who attend the YMCA several
times a week or some other social group activity where
smoking is prohibited and see if differences in smoking are
similar in magnitude to that seen with those who participate
in religious activities.
