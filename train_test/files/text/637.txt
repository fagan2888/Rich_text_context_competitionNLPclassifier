Associations of Substance Use, Abuse, and Dependence with Subsequent
Suicidal Behavior
Guilherme Borges,1-2 Ellen E. Walters,1 and Ronald C. Kessler1
General population survey data are used to disaggregate the associations of substance use disorders with
suicide attempts in order to evaluate a number of hypotheses about the processes leading to these associations.
Data are from the US National Comorbidity Survey (1990-1992). Discrete-time survival analysis is used to study
the effects of retrospectively reported temporally prior substance use, abuse, and dependence in predicting first
onset of suicidal behavior. Alcohol and drug use predict subsequent suicide attempts after controlling for
sociodemographics and comorbid mental disorders. Previous use is not a significant predictor among current
nonusers. Abuse and dependence are significant predictors among users for three of the 10 substances
considered (alcohol, inhalants, and heroin). The number of substances used is more important than the types
of substances used in predicting suicidal behavior. Disaggregation shows that the effects of use are largely on
suicidal ideation and nonplanned attempts among ideators. In comparison, the effects of use on suicide plans
and planned attempts among ideators are not significant. Clinicians need to be aware that current substance
use, even in the absence of abuse or dependence, is a significant risk factor for unplanned suicide attempts
among ideators. Am J Epidemiol 2000;151:781-9.

Although previous research in both community sam-
ples (1-3) and clinical samples (4-6) documents that
high proportions of suicide attempters have alcohol
and drug abuse or dependence, several issues concern-
ing this association remain uncertain. First, with the
exception of alcohol, little is known about the types of
substances most strongly related to suicide attempts.
Whether depressants are stronger predictors of suicide
attempts than are stimulants or hallucinogens is of par-
ticular interest (1, 7, 8). Second, it is not known
whether substance abuse and dependence are the pri-
mary predictors of suicide attempts or whether sub-
stance users without abuse or dependence also have
elevated risk (9). Third, it is unclear whether suicide
attempts are associated with a past history of substance
disorder or only with having an active disorder (10).
Fourth, little is known as to whether substance disor-

ders predict suicidal ideation, plans among ideators,
attempts among ideators either with or without a plan,
or some combination of these transitions (11, 12).
Finally, the extent to which comorbid mental disorders
explain the associations between substance disorders
and suicidal behaviors is unknown (13, 14).
All these issues are addressed in the current report,
which is based on analysis of data obtained in the
National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) (15). The NCS is
a nationally representative survey of the US household
population that includes retrospective reports about the
ages at onset and lifetime occurrences of suicidal
ideation, plans, and attempts along with information
about the occurrences of mental disorders, substance
use, substance abuse, and substance dependence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample
The NCS was carried out between 1990 and 1992 in
a nationally representative household sample of 8,098
persons aged 15-54 years. Informed consent was
obtained from all respondents and from the parents of
respondents who were minors aged 15-17 years. The
response rate was 82.4 percent. Two-part interviews
were carried out face-to-face in the homes of respon-
dents. The part I interview, which was administered to
all 8,098 respondents, assessed the lifetime and recent
781
782 Borges et al.
prevalences of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 3rd ed., rev. (DSM-EIR) (16) psy-
chiatric disorders. The part II interview, which was
administered to a total of 5,877 respondents consisting
of all those who screened positive for any psychiatric
disorder in part I and a probability subsample of all
remaining respondents, collected data on correlates of
psychiatric disorders. The part II data are the basis for
the current report, as questions about suicidal behav-
iors were included in the part II interview. These data
were weighted to correct for differential probabilities
of selection in part II as well as for differential proba-
bilities of within-household selection and nonre-
sponse. Comparisons of the part II NCS demographic
distributions with census data show that the sample is
representative of the US population on a wide range of
sociodemographic variables (17). More details about
the NCS design and data collection methods are
reported elsewhere (15, 18).
Measures
Diagnoses were based on the definitions and criteria
of the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-lUR,
operationalized with a modified version of the World
Health Organization's Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (19). The CIDI is a fully
structured interview designed for use by trained inter-
viewers who are not clinicians. The diagnoses of cen-
tral interest are abuse of and dependence on alcohol
and drugs. The substances considered here include
alcohol, four types of prescription medication (anal-
gesics, sedatives, tranquilizers, and stimulants), and
five types of illicit drugs (marijuana and hashish,
cocaine, inhalants, hallucinogens, and heroin).
Retrospective reports were obtained for each sub-
stance on age at first use, age at onset of abuse, and age
at onset of dependence. Abuse was defined as the per-
sistent (at least 1 month) or repeated occurrence of
either 1) continued use despite knowledge of having a
social, occupational, psychologic, or physical problem
caused or exacerbated by use of the substance or 2)
recurrent use in situations in which use is physically
hazardous. Dependence was defined as the persistent
or repeated occurrence of at least three of nine DSM-
111R symptoms, such as unsuccessful attempts to con-
trol use, tolerance, and withdrawal. Abuse and depen-
dence are defined as mutually exclusive so that a
respondent who meets criteria for both abuse and
dependence is classified as having dependence but not
abuse.
Controls were also included for a number of other
DSM-11LR disorders that include mood disorders
(major depression, mania, and dysthymia), anxiety dis-
orders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder,
phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder), conduct
disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and nonaffec-
tive psychosis. The assessments of all these disorders,
with the exceptions of conduct disorder and antisocial
personality disorder, were based on the CIDI. Conduct
disorder and antisocial personality disorder were
assessed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (20)
because the CIDI does not include these diagnoses.
World Health Organization CIDI field trials (21) and
NCS clinical reappraisal studies (22) both document
good reliability and the validity of most of the CIDI
diagnoses considered here with two important excep-
tions. The first involves mania. Only the euphoric-
grandiose subtype of mania is validly assessed with the
CIDI (23). As a result, only this subtype is included in
the definition of mania used in this report. The second
involves nonaffective psychosis, which is substantially
overdiagnosed with the CIDI (22). As a result, the
CIDI was used as a first-stage screen for nonaffective
psychosis. All NCS respondents who screened positive
had clinical reinterviews prior to a final diagnosis of
nonaffective psychosis (24).
The NCS questions about suicidality asked about the
lifetime occurrence; age at onset; and recency of suici-
dal ideation ("Have you ever seriously thought about
committing suicide?"), suicide plans ("Have you ever
made a plan for committing suicide?"), and suicide
attempts ("Have you ever attempted suicide?"). The
outcome of primary interest in this report is the first
lifetime occurrence of a suicide attempt, although we
also examine intervening effects of significant predic-
tors on first onset of suicidal ideation, developing a
plan among ideators, making a first attempt among
people with a plan, and making a first attempt among
ideators without a plan.
The sociodemographic variables included in the
analyses as covariates are sex, marital status, cohort,
educational attainment, race-ethnicity, urbanicity, and
age of youngest child. Marital status was coded to dif-
ferentiate the currently married, previously married
(separated, divorced, widowed), and never married.
Cohort was coded to differentiate respondents born in
the decades 1966-1975, 1956-1965, 1946-1955, and
1936-1945. Educational attainment was coded to dif-
ferentiate current students from those who already
completed their schooling and, within each of these
two categories, to differentiate those who had com-
pleted less than high school (0-11 years), high school
(12 years), some college (13-15 years), and college or
more (^16 years). Race-ethnicity was coded to differ-
entiate among non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic
Black, Hispanic, and other (Native American, Asian,
Pacific Islander, and respondents who self-defined
themselves as "other"). Urbanicity was coded into
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 151, No. 8, 2000
Suicidal Behavior and Substance Use in the NCS 783
three categories to differentiate among respondents
living in census-defined major metropolitan areas,
census-defined urban areas, and census-defined non-
urban areas. Finally, age of youngest child was coded
into four categories consisting of respondents who had
no living child and those whose youngest child was 1
year or less old, between 2 and 10 years inclusive, and
more than 10 years of age.
Analysis procedures
Discrete-time survival analyses with time-varying
covariates (25) were used to estimate the effects of
substance use, abuse, and dependence on predicting
the subsequent first occurrence of a suicide attempt. A
discrete-time approach was used instead of the more
traditional continuous-time approach because the NCS
recorded the time to event at yearly intervals rather
than on a continuous time scale and because the
discrete-time approach facilitates the use of the many
different time-dependent covariates included in our
analyses (26). The use of survival analyses relied on
retrospective age-at-onset reports to establish a tem-
poral order between the predictors and the outcomes
(27). This was done by treating the person-year as the
unit of analysis and creating separate observational
records for each year of a person's life up to and
including the year at first onset of the outcome. A
dichotomous variable was created to distinguish the
year of the outcome (coded 1) from years prior to the
outcome (coded 0). These data files were analyzed
using logistic regression models that included a
dummy variable control for each person-year.
Because of the complex sample design and weight-
ing of the NCS, standard errors of the survival coeffi-
cients were estimated using the method of jacknife
repeated replications (28). These estimates adjust for
the clustering and weighting of cases in the household
sample. The survival coefficients were exponentiated
and are reported in the form of odds ratios. The 95 per-
cent confidence intervals of these coefficients also are
reported and have been adjusted for design effects.
Multivariate tests were based on Wald chi-squares
computed from coefficient variance-covariance matri-
ces that were adjusted for design effects. Results
referred to as statistically significant are those that are
significant based on two-sided design-based tests eval-
uated at the 0.05 level of significance.
RESULTS
Aggregate associations
The lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts in the
NCS is 4.6 percent. Cross-sectional bivariate associa-
tions between sociodemographics and lifetime history
of making an attempt are shown in table 1.
Significantly elevated prevalences are found among
women, the previously married, respondents in the
youngest cohort, and those with comparatively low
levels of education. It is also shown that respondents
with alcohol and drug dependence have elevated
prevalences of suicide attempts.
Table 2 shows the results of survival analyses in
which the time-lagged effects of alcohol and drug use,
abuse, and dependence on predicting first suicide
attempt are assessed with multivariate controls for
sociodemographic variables. As shown in model 1, the
odds ratios associated with history of substance use
and substance disorders (with nonusers being the con-
trast category) in separate multivariate equations for
alcohol and drugs range between 2.8 (alcohol use) and
17.6 (alcohol dependence). There is a dramatic gradi-
ent in these odds ratios, with the lowest associated
with use and the highest associated with dependence.
The results in model 2 show how these odds ratios
change when we introduce controls for comorbid life-
time mental disorders with ages at onset prior to the age
at first suicide attempt. The odds ratios, although all
still significant, are considerably smaller than in model
1, suggesting that a substantial part of the gross associ-
ations are due to comorbidities with these mental disor-
ders, hi addition, the clear differences in the magni-
tudes of odds ratios associated with histories of use,
abuse, and dependence seen in model 1 are substan-
tially attenuated in model 2. Finally, the results in
model 3 show how the odds ratios change when mea-
sures of alcohol and drug use, abuse, and dependence
are included in a single prediction equation. The odds
ratios associated with abuse and dependence decrease
noticeably compared with their values in model 2.
Nonetheless, separate tests (with results not shown in
table 2) that reparameterized the model using contrast
coding of the substance exposures found that the odds
ratios of abuse and dependence are significantly differ-
ent from those of use for both alcohol (x2
2
= 6.6, p =
0.037) and drugs (/2
2
= 12.6, p = 0.002) in model 3.
Substance-specific associations
The joint effects of use, abuse, and dependence are
further explored in table 3 by focusing separately on
each of the 10 substances assessed in the NCS. Each
row of the table is based on a separate survival equa-
tion that includes dichotomous measures of depen-
dence, abuse without dependence, and use without
abuse of or dependence on one particular substance
along with controls for sociodemographics and comor-
bid lifetime mental disorders with ages at onset prior to
the age at first suicide attempt. The substance use

ences in the odds ratios within substances found that
the dependence and abuse odds ratios are significantly
different from the odds ratios associated with use for
only three of the 10 substances: alcohol {y?2
= 31.9,
p < 0.001), inhalants (x2

heroin (%2

Associations with current versus previous
lifetime use
The results in table 4 focus on the effects of use
(with or without abuse or dependence) and distinguish
between person-years associated with current and pre-
vious use. Coefficients are based on 10 separate equa-
tions, one for each substance. All 10 of the current use
odds ratios are statistically significant predictors of
first suicide attempt, controlling for sociodemograph-
ics and comorbid lifetime mental disorders. Odds
ratios range between 2.0 for current cocaine use and
6.1 for current heroin use. In comparison, only two of
the previous use odds ratios are statistically signifi-
cant: those for marijuana (odds ratio (OR) = 1.5) and
heroin (OR = 2.4). The other odds ratios for previous
use are in the range 0.8-1.8 and are mostly greater than

t Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were obtained from discrete-time survival analyses using design-
based methods (see Analysis procedures subsection) to obtain standard errors. This table represents the results
of 10 equations, one for each row. Each model controls for sociodemographics and comorbid lifetime mental dis-
orders with ages at onset prior to the age at first suicide attempt. The reference category is never use. Percentages

1.0. This indicates the existence of a positive trend
association with attempted suicide. However, this set
of odds ratios is not significant globally (%2
8
= 8.3,
p = 0.405). Furthermore, no significant effects could
be found in post hoc analyses of a global dummy vari-
able for any previous drug use (x2i = 0.4, p -- 0.527)
or a continuous variable for number of drugs previ-
ously used (x2! = 0.3, p = 0.584).
A survival model was estimated that included sepa-
rate dummy variables for current use (with or without
abuse or dependence) of each substance along with
controls for sociodemographics and comorbid lifetime
mental disorders. As a set, the 10 coefficients for cur-
rent use were found to be powerful predictors of first
suicide attempt (x2
l0
= 162.9, p < 0.001). Seven of the
10 substances had odds ratios greater than 1.0: alcohol,
sedatives, tranquilizers, stimulants, marijuana,
inhalants, and heroin. The other three substances (anal-
gesics, cocaine, and hallucinogens) had insignificant
odds ratios less than 1.0. The seven positive odds
ratios did not differ significantly from each other. This
means that the number of substances used is more
important than the types of substances used (/2
7
= 5.7,
p = 0.647).
Decomposition of associations through ideation
and plans
We combined this result with information about the
number of substances currently used into a single
count ranging between 0 and 7. As shown in table 5,
there is a significant monotonic relation between this
count and the subsequent occurrence of a first suicide
attempt (%2
6
= 88.5, p < 0.001). The range of odds
ratios is dramatic, from a low of 2.6 associated with
use of only one substance (compared with respondents
who currently used none) to a high of 27.4 associated
with use of six or seven substances.
Table 5 also presents the results of survival equa-
tions that disaggregate this overall relation into com-
ponents from suicidal ideation to planned suicide
attempt. The first of these equations considers the
effects of use on first onset of suicidal ideation. The six
odds ratios are statistically significant as a set (%2
6
=
199.4, p < 0.001), and there is a consistent monotonic
relation across the set from a low of 1.6 associated
with use of one substance to a high of 13.2 associated
with use of six or seven substances. However, none of
the odds ratios is as large as the parallel coefficients in
the equation to predict suicide attempt.
The next equation considers the effects of use on
subsequent first onset of a suicide plan in the subsam-
ple of ideators. The six odds ratios are not statistically
significant as a set (%2
6
= 10.4, p -- 0.107), although
all the odds ratios are greater than 1.0, and there is a
significant odds ratio associated with using six or
seven substances (OR = 2.9). None of the odds ratios
in this equation is nearly as large as the parallel coeffi-
cients in the equations to predict ideation or attempt. A
separate analysis, not reported in the table, shows that
a single dummy variable for any use is also not signif-
icant in predicting onset of a plan.
The last two equations consider the effects of use on
first suicide attempt in either the absence or the pres-
ence of a plan. The odds ratios in the equation for
unplanned attempt are statistically significant as a set
(X 6 = 21.6, p < 0.001), and each of the individual

t Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were obtained from discrete-time survival analyses using design-based methods (see Analysis procedures sub-
section) to obtain standard errors. This table represents the results of a single model (applied to the five outcomes) that controls for socJodemographlcs and
comorbid lifetime mental disorders with ages at onset prior to the age at first suicide attempt. The reference category is zero substances currently used.

odds ratios also is statistically significant. There is no
meaningful dose-response relation among the coeffi-
cients. In comparison, the odds ratios in the equation
for planned attempt are not significant either as a set
(2C2
6= 3.6, p = 0.732) or individually, although all but
one of the odds ratios are greater than 1.0. A separate
analysis, again not reported in the table, shows that a
single dummy variable for any use is also not signifi-
cant in predicting onset of a planned attempt.
Finally, we evaluated specifications of the results in
table 5 as a function of the sociodemographic variables
(sex, marital status, cohort, educational attainment,
race-ethnicity, urbanicity, and age of youngest child).
Global interaction tests of the number of drugs (mod-
eled as a continuous variable) with sociodemographic
variables were performed based on backwards elimi-
nation from a saturated two-way interaction equation.
This was done for each of the four nested outcomes
(ideation, plan among ideators, unplanned attempt, and
planned attempt). We found no more significant inter-
actions than one would expect by chance (two of 28).
DISCUSSION
The results reported here are limited by the fact that
the NCS is a cross-sectional survey in which informa-
tion about the occurrences and ages at onset of lifetime
substance use and suicidal behaviors is based on retro-
spective reports. Unwillingness to report or failure to
recall accurately the age at onset could introduce errors
into the results. Within the context of these limitations,
the association between substance disorders and sui-
cide attempts that has been found repeatedly in both
clinical samples (5, 29-32) and community samples
(1, 3, 33, 34) was replicated. Consistent with previous
research (35-37), our results show significantly higher
lifetime prevalences of attempted suicide among
women and the previously married, along with a sig-
nificant inverse association with education (38).
As noted in the Introduction, little attention has been
given in previous research to the specifications consid-
ered in the current report. The first issue considered
was that it might not be substance disorders them-
selves, but rather comorbid lifetime mental disorders
that predict suicide attempts (13, 14). Our results were
partially consistent with this hypothesis in showing
that statistical controls for comorbid mental disorders
lead to a substantial reduction in the odds ratios asso-
ciated with substance use disorders. However, the
residual odds ratios remain statistically significant
even after controls for mental disorders, strongly sug-
gesting that the effects of substance use disorders on
suicide attempts are not entirely due to the effects of
comorbid mental disorders.
The second issue considered was whether there is a
significant difference in the odds ratios associated with
use in the absence of abuse or dependence and the
odds ratios associated with abuse or dependence. Use
was found to be a consistent significant predictor
across all substances, while we found significant incre-
mental effects of abuse or dependence for only three
substances (alcohol, inhalants, and heroin).
The third issue considered was whether the associ-
ation between use and suicide attempt is found across
a wide array of drugs or is limited only to substances
with certain pharmacologic properties. Our results
are quite clear in showing that, after controlling for
the confounding effects of sociodemographics and
mental disorders, the strength of the association is
very similar for all the types of drugs studied. The

number of substances is clearly more important than
the type of substance in predicting first suicide
attempt. This finding contradicts the hypothesis that
depressants (e.g., alcohol and tranquilizers) are
stronger predictors of suicide attempts than are other
substances (7, 8).
The fourth issue considered was whether it is current
use or a history of use that more strongly predicts sui-
cide attempts. The former was found to be the case,
although there are two significant odds ratios for pre-
vious use (of marijuana and heroin). With these excep-
tions, we found that the major risk of suicidal behav-
iors is linked to current use rather than to past use,
suggesting that the causal pathways involved in this
association are ones that are activated by use or its
proximate correlates.
Although there has not been a great deal of research
on the disaggregation of substance effects on suicide
attempts through ideation and plans, what little is
known about this matter suggests that substance disor-
ders are associated weakly with suicide ideation, but
more strongly with plans among ideators (11, 12, 39,
40). We found exactly the opposite. It is not clear why
this discrepancy exists, but it is worth noting that the
previous studies that examined this specification did
not attempt to use age-at-onset reports to sort out tem-
poral priorities and disaggregate nested effects in the
way we did in the current report. It is conceivable that
this difference in refinement of measures and analysis
methods explains the discrepancies.
Another interesting and related specification is our
failure to find a dose-response relation between the
number of substances used and the risk of unplanned
suicide. Assuming that use of multiple drugs does not
lead to any greater disinhibition than does use of only
one drug, this finding is consistent with the disinhibi-
tion hypothesis, which specifies that intoxication can
increase risk of suicide attempts among ideators by
reducing inhibitions to make an impulsive attempt (41,
42).
Importantly, the association between the number of
substances used and the onset of suicidal ideation does
exhibit a dose-response relation. The fact that this is
not true of the association between the number of sub-
stances used and the unplanned attempts among
ideators implies that the processes involved in the
association between use and ideation are different
from those involved in the association between use and
progression from ideation to an unplanned attempt We
have no way of knowing what these processes might
be, but it is noteworthy that they involve determinants
of current rather than of lifetime use. This suggests that
the most fruitful areas for further investigation are
likely to involve active influences on use or short-term
adverse consequences that no longer exist once use has
ended.
Finally, the results reported here suggest that clini-
cians should recognize that substance users with sui-
cidal ideation have an elevated risk of first suicide
attempts even in the absence of a plan. This is an
important result in light of the fact that the presence
of a plan is typically used as the key indicator of sui-
cide risk among ideators and the fact that little is
known about the predictors of attempted suicide
among ideators without a plan. The failure to find a
dose-response relation in predicting unplanned
attempts among ideators indirectly suggests that dis-
inhibition is somehow involved in the effects of sub-
stance use. It would be useful for future research to
investigate this suggestion more directly by develop-
ing measures of individual differences in disinhibi-
tion while under the influence as well as by investi-
gating the mediating and modifying effects of
personality characteristics associated with lack of
planning.
