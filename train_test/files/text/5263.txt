Introduction
The paralysis of US immigration policy at the federal level
now means that policymaking is centered at the state level,
where legislatures have passed thousands of laws address-
ing immigrant-related issues over the past decade.
Explaining disparate state responses to immigration has
been the focus of a growing body of research, with some
researchers focusing on the rise of anti-immigration state
laws (Ybarra et al., 2016; Zingher, 2014; Marquez and
Schraufnagel, 2013; Reich and Barth, 2012; Turner and
Sharry, 2012; Schildkraut, 2001) and others emphasizing
the relative mix of pro- and anti-immigrant state legislation
(Gulasekaram and Ramakrishan, 2015; Rivera, 2014;
Monogan, 2013; Nicholson-Crotty and Nicholson-Crotty,
2011; Boushey and Ludtke, 2011).
Because the growth of state immigration legislation fol-
lowed the expansion of immigration flows into states that had
little past experience with immigration, a key issue within
existing research has been the extent to which state activism
reflects demographic pressures resulting from increases in
immigration versus a politically-motivated shift towards either
punitive or accommodating policies (Gulasekaram and
Ramakrishnan, 2015). Existing research has yielded contra-
dictory findings. Gulasekaram and Ramakrishnan find restric-
tive legislation unrelated to state demographic change but
rather a function of polarized partisan politics. By contrast,
Monogan (2013), Nicholson-Crotty and Nicholson-Crotty
(2011), and Boushey and Luedtke (2011) generally find parti-
sanship unrelated to state legislation, with Boushey and
Luedtke presenting evidence that larger immigrant popula-
tions induce more integrative state legislation. However, their
results also suggest that larger foreign-born populations were
significantly related to restrictive legislation and that the
growth of immigration was positively related to both integra-
tion and control policies. Zingher (2014) finds that both legis-
lative conservatism and the growth of immigration propelled
restrictive legislation while Marquez and Schraufnagel (2013)
and Ybarra et al. (2016) present evidence of a more focused
backlash against Hispanic immigrants. However, Marquez
and Schraufnagel's results again suggest a contradiction, with
the growth of state Hispanic populations also associated with
increases in pro-immigrant legislation.
An unresolved problem in existing research is the fail-
ure to address two sources of causal heterogeneity. First,
existing studies often fail to consider whether increased

Abstract
State governments are now the principal source of immigrant legislation in the US. Existing research presents contradictory
findings concerning the sources of pro- and anti-immigration state legislation. However, research has not adequately
accounted for the multidimensional nature of immigrant legislation and the fact that many variables hypothesized to
affect state legislation encompass both within-state, time-varying effects and time-invariant, cross-sectional effects.
Measurement and research design strategies to address these problems are applied to a dataset of state immigrant
legislation approved between 2005 and 2012. The findings are important because they show that partisan, demographic,
and economic effects are often different within versus across states and may differently affect the volume versus the
relative tenor of legislative output.

2 Research and Politics 
legislative activity necessarily alters the overall tenor of
state legislative output. Because immigrant legislation
spans multiple issue areas (education, health care, law
enforcement, labor laws, professional licensing, welfare
benefits), states produce varying mixes of accommodat-
ing and restrictive legislation. As a result, an increased
volume of one type of law (restrictive or accommodating)
may not necessarily change the relative tenor of state
immigrant legislation. Thus, research designs should
consider whether variable effects are presumed to affect
the volume of immigrant legislation, the overall tenor of
legislation, or both.
Second, researchers have generally ignored cross-state
versus within-state causal effects at the state level.
Individual predictors at the state level often simultane-
ously encompass short-term changes observed within a
state over a given period of time--such as changes in the
growth of immigrant populations or partisan control of
government--and cross-sectional effects that are static
over the course of most observational studies: the same
variable also registers that some states are whiter, more
Republican, or have larger immigrant populations than
others. The problem is that in the presence of both causal
effects, as Bell and Jones (2015) show, a single measure
represents an uninterpretable, weighted average of these
two effects. In situations where variables encompass both
a time-varying, "within-unit" process as well as a time-
invariant, "between-unit" effect, Bell and Jones argue for
a random effects estimation strategy that separately
measures these two effects. This approach creates sepa-
rate coefficients that distinguish time-variant and time-
invariant effects. "Within-unit" effects for each
time-varying independent variable are calculated by sub-
tracting the (in this case) state mean from the value of
each observation:
x x
ij j
-
where each i represents an observation--here, a legislative
year--of variable x in state j and xj
is the mean of that
variable across all observed years in state j. "Between-unit"
(i.e., cross-state) effects can then be estimated using the
mean value of the same variable at the state level xj
, in
addition to any other exclusively time-invariant meas-
ures, zj
. In this manner, average contextual differences
across states can be distinguished from time-varying
within-state effects. This "between" versus "within" hierar-
chical approach is presented below for a dataset of state
immigration laws approved between 2005 and 2012. The
models separately measure the absolute number of each
type of law produced as well as the relative balance of
accommodating versus restrictive legislation. At the same
time, variable effects are measured so as to distinguish
within-state changes over time from more time-invariant,
cross-state differences.
Independent variables
Between-state variables.Many variables that have figured
prominently in recent research differ across states, but not
(over the course of existing observational studies) within
states, including the following variables:
(1) Institutions of direct democracy (Turner and Sharry,
2012; Reich and Barth, 2012 Schildkraut 2001).
Differences in the presence and strength of direct
democracy are captured here via Lewis's (2011)
"Direct Democracy Impact" measure, normalized
to range from 0 (No citizen initiatives) to 5 (Highly
influential direct democracy).1
(2) Legislative professionalism (Monogan, 2013).
Squire's (2007) measure of legislative professional-
ism (measured here as 0 through 100) captures dif-
ferences between professional and citizen legislatures
over the period 2005 through 2012. This variable is a
weighted combination of legislative salary, days in
session, and staff per legislator (as compared with
members of Congress during the same year).
(3) The growth of the state Latino population, 2000­
2010 (Ybarra et al., 2016; Marquez and
Schraufnagel, 2013). This variable is included to
capture the specific effect of Latino immigration,
which may differ from that of immigration among
all nationalities (see below) and has been linked to
restrictive legislation.2
(4) Citizen ideology (Monogan, 2013). This is meas-
ured as the percentage of the state population in
2005 that self-identified as liberal, based on public
opinion data used by Pacheco (2011).
(5) Immigrant State Welfare Eligibility (Filindra, 2013;
Hero and Preuhs, 2007). The 1996 Personal
Responsibility and Work Opportunities
Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) afforded states dis-
cretion to define standards for immigrant welfare
eligibility. The welfare policies that states estab-
lished in the period following PRWORAcan be seen
as establishing a baseline level of accommodation or
restriction that may influence subsequent legisla-
tion; thus, the direction of legislation between 2005
and 2012 may display continuity with immigration
welfare policy regimes established post-PRWORA.
State variations in defining immigrant welfare eligi-
bility are captured via Hero and Preuhs factor-score
measure, which is based on nine welfare-related
policy items and ranges from -1.11 (exclusive) to
1.67 (inclusive).3
Within-state variables.Other variables identified in recent
research contain both a cross-sectional and a time-varying
effect, with the time-varying component measuring changes
within states between 2005 and 2012:
Reich 3
(1) Percent foreign-born population (Nicholson-Crotty
and Nicholson-Crotty, 2011; Boushey and Ludtke,
2011; Monogan, 2013).4 Note that the cross-state
average measures the "stock" of immigrants between
2005 and 2012, while the within-state variable meas-
ures changes in the size of the immigrant population
(the "flow" component) during that same period.
(2) Change in per capita state income, lagged one year
(Filindra and Pearson-Moskowitz, 2013; Ybarra
et al., 2015).5
(3) Republican party control (Zingher, 2014). Two
measures operationalize this effect: the percentage
of Democratic state legislators (averaged over both
state legislative chambers), and Republican control
of both the executive and legislative branches
(measured dichotomously).
(4) Latino legislative representation (Preuhs, 2007),
measured as the percentage of Latino state legisla-
tors, averaged over both legislative chambers.6
Dependent variable and estimation procedure
The dependent variables are derived from an original coding
of 1393 laws approved by state legislatures between 2005
and 2012.7 The data is grouped by state and legislative year,
yielding 371 observations across 8 years (see Table A1 in
online appendix for additional information on the coding
protocol and a summary of laws approved in each state).8
Two types of laws are analyzed.Accommodating legislation
sought to make public services, employment, state licenses,
and housing more accessible to immigrant populations,
regardless of their legal status. Restrictive legislation sought
to bar access to the same goods and outcomes and/or enlisted
state and local law enforcement in efforts to identify unau-
thorized immigrants. Following most recent work on state
immigration legislation (Ybarra, 2015; Marquez and
Schraufnagel, 2013; Nicholson-Crotty and Nicholson-
Crotty, 2011; Boushey and Ludtke, 2010), unweighted
counts of each type of law are used; the presumption is that
counts of legislative output speak meaningfully to the
importance of immigrant-related issues across legislatures
as well as the policy intentions of legislators.9
As is common with panel data, the counts of accommo-
dating and restrictive state legislation are "overdispersed"
(the variance is greater than the mean). Following Gelman
and Hill (2007: 326) and Bell and Jones (2015: 147), over-
dispersion is incorporated directly by including random
effects at both the state and the observation level, yielding
a three-level, Poisson regression:

In this model, the number of laws approved in legislative
year i in state j (Yij
) is a function of the vector of "between-
state" (j
) and "within-state" covariates, ij.
The between-
state components include the state-level means xij
( ), time
invariant measures (zj
), and a random state-level effect
(uj
). The variance at the observation level, , includes the
additional random effect 
1ij ij j
x x
-
( ) that captures varia-
tion beyond that explained by the Poisson regression (i.e.,
overdispersion). The random effects are assumed to be dis-
tributed normally.10 Posterior means and standard devia-
tions are estimated via Bayesian Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) resampling.11 Because immigration-
related legislation (both restrictive and accommodating)
increased steadily in almost all states between 2005 and
2012, a linear trend is included, with each year indexed as
one through eight. The year index was statistically signifi-
cant for both pro- and anti-immigration legislation, while
also improving the overall fit of the models, as indicated
by a lower Bayesian deviance information criterion.12 The
Woolridge test for autocorrelated errors in panel data
(Woolridge, 2002) failed to reject the null hypothesis of no
serial correlation.
Findings: Revisiting state legislation
Table 1 provides both the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and
standard deviations for each variable, with asterisks indi-
cating particularly robust directional effects: for a positive
(negative) posterior mean, it indicates that less than 5% of
its posterior distribution contains negative (positive) val-
ues.13 Models 1 and 2 illustrate the importance of distin-
guishing cross-sectional from time-varying effects. Model
1 suggests that the count of accommodating legislation
increased with the share of Democratic legislators within a
state: each percentage increase in Democratic legislative
representation increased the count of accommodating laws
by approximately 5% per year. However, the "between
state" coefficient shows that states that averaged higher
Democratic representation over the period 2005 to 2012
were actually associated with a 2% reduction in the annual
count of accommodating legislation.
Demographic and economic effects are also marked by
different within- and between-state effects. Within states,
restrictive laws increased by 52% for every percentage
increase in the immigrant population. But states with
larger immigrant populations passed more of both types
of immigrant legislation: the average size of the immi-
grant population was associated with a 5­7% annual
increase in both restrictive and accommodating legisla-
tion. Changes in state per capita income were also related
to immigration legislation, consistent with Ybarra et al.
(2016). However, their study only examined punitive state
laws. By contrast, Models 1 and 2 show that each percent-
age increase in per capita income (the "within-state"
effect) is associated with, respectively, a 4% and 8%
4 Research and Politics 
decrease in both accommodating and restrictive legisla-
tion, suggesting that immigrant legislation became less
salient to legislators as state income grew. These distinc-
tions were not possible in existing research, either because
researchers collapsed state legislative output over multi-
ple years (losing the time component) or did not distin-
guish within- versus between-state variable effects.
Other variables in Models 1 and 2 are more closely
associated with one type law than the other. Citizen ideol-
ogy, direct democracy, and the share of Latino legislators
are strongly associated with counts of restrictive legisla-
tion, but less so with accommodating legislation. In
Model 2, restrictive legislation increased by 21% for each
unit increase in Lewis's six-point "Direct Democracy"

index, and decreased by 10% for each percentage increase
in citizen liberalism and Latino representation. The cred-
ible interval indicates a greater than 95% posterior prob-
ability of these directional effects. By contrast,
accommodating legislation is closely associated with
more generous welfare benefits for immigrants: each per-
centage increase in the IW eligibility scale increased the
count of accommodating laws by 61%, which translates
into 1.7 more accommodating laws per legislative year
from the lowest to highest observed values of the scale.
Still other variables commonly cited in existing research,
such as legislative professionalism, the growth in state
Latino populations, and Republican control, had more
ambiguous effects, with wide credible intervals that
encompassed both increases and decreases in each type
of immigration legislation.
Of course, as argued above, changes in the volume of each
type of law do not address shifts in the relative balance of
legislative output. Table 2 uses a multinomial logistic model
to compare three legislative outcomes. In some instances, leg-
islatures approved more restrictive (R) laws than accommo-
dating (A) laws. This outcome, R>A, constitutes the base
category in Table 2, and is contrasted to outcomes in which
accommodating legislation predominated (A>R), and accom-
modating and restrictive laws were approved in equal num-
bers (A=R).14 Relative risk ratios (RRR) estimate the effect of
a one-unit change in each variable on the probability of the
A>R andA=R outcomes relative to the base category, holding
all other variables constant.
The results suggest that partisan effects were important
totherelativebalanceoflaws,consistentwithGulasekaram
and Ramakrishnan (2015), but in nuanced ways. In states
where Republican control of legislative and executive
branches was more common, the odds of a relatively
accommodating outcome (A>R) were 81% lower (RRR =
0.19) compared to the "restrictive dominant" (R>A) out-
come, a directional effect with a greater than 99% poste-
rior probability (PP). A similar, but weaker directional
effect occurs between the "neutral" outcome (A=R) and
the R>A base category (RRR = 0.45, PP = 82%). Thus,
although Table 1 suggests that Republican control of state
government was not strongly associated with the volume
of either accommodating or restrictive legislation, Table 2
suggests that it moved the balance of legislative output in
a restrictive direction. Likewise, within states, each per-
centage increase in Democratic legislative representation
increased the odds of the accommodating outcome over
the restrictive base outcome by 8% (PP = 99%) and by 5%
for the A=R outcome (PP = 83%). However, legislatures
that averaged higher Democratic representation across the
period 2005 to 2012 were actually less likely to shift
toward a relatively more accommodating stance. Taken
together, Tables 1 and 2 suggest an interesting legislative
dynamic: more Democratic-leaning states were actually
less likely to adopt a more accommodating tone toward
immigrants, except as the share of Democratic legislators
within the state increased.
Table 2 further clarifies the directional effects of eco-
nomic and demographic variables. As the average size of
the foreign-born population increased, states were more
likely to be, on balance, accommodating (RRR = 1.06,
PP = 92%) or neutral (RRR = 1.12, PP = .95%) rather
than restrictive. Likewise, each percentage increase in
average per capita income increased the odds of the more
accommodating outcome (A>R) over the restrictive out-
come by 59% (PP = 99%), and the neutral outcome by
90% (PP = 99%). Thus, larger average foreign-born pop-
ulations raised legislative output while higher average
per capita income reduced output (Table 1); however,
both variables were positively associated with a shift
toward less restrictive outcomes, consistent with
Boushey and Luedtke (2011) and Filindra and Pearson-
Merkowitz (2013).
Table 2 also suggests hypotheses regarding the politi-
cal processes producing each outcome. The odds of the
A>R outcome compared to the R>A base outcome approx-
imately doubled (RRR = 1.96, PP = 99%) for each unit
increase in the Immigrant Welfare State and increased by
5% with average Latino legislative representation (PP =
99%). Each percentage increase in Latino representation
within states further increased the relative probability of
the accommodating outcome over the restrictive outcome
by 18% (PP = 88%). Thus, growing Latino representation
decreased the volume of restrictive legislation (Table 1)
and tilted state legislation toward a relatively more accom-
modating balance (Table 2). By contrast, more direct
democracy decreased the odds of the accommodating and
neutral outcomes by, respectively, 11% (PP = 87%) and
20% (PP = 92%) compared to the base outcome. In short,
a restrictive outcome was less likely where states imple-
mented more inclusive post-PRWORA welfare benefits
for immigrants and where Latinos were a larger and grow-
ing share of state legislators. By contrast, stronger institu-
tions of direct democracy reduced the odds of either the
accommodating or neutral outcomes compared to the
more restrictive outcome.
Naturally, the results here are time-bound, encompass-
ing an eight-year period when the forces of immigration
restriction were extremely influential in Republican state
politics; and because there is no uniform standard for clas-
sifying state legislation, results may vary according to how
researchers classify state legislation. However, the find-
ings here suggest two guidelines that would provide more
clarity and consistency to future research. First, given the
multidimensional nature of immigrant legislation, causal
arguments need to distinguish variable effects on the vol-
ume of legislation versus the relative balance of laws.
Understanding whether states end up moving toward a
relatively restrictive set of policies (e.g., Arizona), more
accommodating policies (California), or some
6 Research and Politics 
intermediate outcome depends on this distinction. Second,
research would benefit from a clearer distinction of within-
and between-state variable effects where variables encom-
pass both processes. Substantively, many explanatory
variables simultaneously measure the "pull of history"--
relatively enduring contextual differences across states--
as well as short-term economic, political, and demographic
shifts. The forces may exert different directional effects on
legislation, a fact that is obscured when research designs
include no time component or when variables measure an
uninterpretable average of both effects.

Notes
 1. Lewis created this variable via a principal components factor
score derived from three variables: (a) legislation insulation,
(b) the degree of difficulty in qualifying an item on the ballot,
and (c) the number of times citizen-initiatives were placed on
state ballots between 1994 and 2006.
 2. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau (2011).
3. The immigrant welfare (IW) scale is based on immigrant
eligibility for state health and welfare programs as of 1999,
including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (both
before and after the federally-mandated five-year ban), state
cash payments, food stamps, Medicaid funds, Supplemental
Security Income, and state health care programs. While there
is a six-year gap between the IW measure and the start of the
legislation examined here, the measure establishes whether a
possible policy trajectory adopted after PRWORA (i.e., as of
1999) influenced post-2004 state legislation.

4. The percentage foreign-born population by state was
obtained from data collected by Pew Research Center's
(2014) Hispanic Trends Projection, based on American
Community Survey data for 2012.
 5. Real state gross domestic product per capita is measured in
2009 chained dollars and is derived from the US Department
of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis (n.d.).
6. Data from the National Association of Latino Elected and
Appointed Officials (2006, 2009, 2010, 2012)
7. Only laws approved by the legislature were considered,
although the substantive results are substantially similar
when resolutions are included. The data were obtained from
National Council of State Legislatures (2017).
8. The N of 371 reflects the fact that not every state legisla-
ture produces legislation annually. Legislatures in Montana,
Nevada, North Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming legislatures
meet biennially, as did the Oregon legislature until 2012 and
Arkansas until 2010. Nebraska's non-partisan legislature is
excluded from the analysis.
 9. Raw counts also avoid the problem of determining "policy
relevance," which involves ambiguous criteria, such as: (a)
the share of immigrants likely to be affected; (b) effects on
current immigrants versus future arrivals; (c) gaps between
legislative intent and implementation/enforcement, and (d)
symbolic versus substantive effects.
10. The variances are assumed to be normally-distributed in the
multilevel Poisson model. Alternatively, a negative bino-
mial distribution can be used to fit overdispersed count data
by including an overdispersion factor. However, such mod-
els use a single parameter to calculate Level 1 and Level 2
overdispersion, leading Rabe-Hesketh and Skondral (2008:
394) to advise against them. Regardless, the distributional
assumption does not appear critical here: coefficients and
standard errors reported below were virtually identical
when the model was estimated via a negative binomial
distribution.
11. Because the data represent a population, rather than a sam-
ple, the goal is to assess the goodness of fit of the models
rather than infer a population value, as in classical hypothesis
testing (Gill, 2001). Posterior means and standard deviations
reported in Tables 1 and 2 are based on 200,000 simulations,
following a "burn in" period of 10,000 iterations.
12. The significant time trend in Model 1 (b = 0.14, p < .001) and
2 (b = 0.10, p < .004) suggests unmeasured processes that
are not easily captured. For example, state legislation may
reflect the growing politicization of immigration nationwide
during a period when Congress debated various immigration
reform proposals or it may also reflect what Gulasekaram and
Ramakrishnan (2015: 101) call "issue entrepreneur" effects.
13. The incidence rate ratio shows the change in the rate (count)
of the dependent variable changes with each unit change in
the independent variable, holding all other variables con-
stant: an incidence rate ratio above 1.00 represents a percent-
age increase in the count, while numbers below 1.00 register
a percentage decrease in the count.
14. For the purposes of this analysis, legislative years in which
no immigrant legislation of any kind was approved are
removed, yielding an N of 286. Distinguishing legislative
outcomes according to the three categories, reduced the
measured state-level variance in both Models 1 and 2 to zero.
Thus, the multinomial logistic models in Table 2 are esti-
mated as single-level models.

Appendix
Classifying State Immigration Laws
The data on immigration-related state legislation is derived
from the National Council of State Legislature Immigration
(NCSL) Immigration Policy Project. Since the intent is to
assess both state legislative interest in immigration-related
issues (i.e. the volume of legislation) and policy direction,
we coded each law approved by the state legislature during
the period 2005 through 2012, including those that may
subsequently have been subject to partial (line item) or
complete gubernatorial veto (approved laws with a subse-
quent gubernatorial veto constituted 3.5% of the total laws
passed). In the case of omnibus bills that addressed more
than one policy area related to immigration, each policy
area addressed in the bill was included in the legislative
count and coded separately for intent. This process yielded
a total of 1,393 laws approved between 2005 and 2012.
State laws were placed into one of three categories:
accommodating laws or resolutions were defined as those
intending to provide legal protection and/or access to public
benefits and employment to immigrants, regardless of their
legal status (unauthorized or authorized), as well as those
encouraging federal reforms designed to extend citizenship
to, and/or discourage the deportation of unauthorized immi-
grants; restrictive laws were those intending to block or
limit access to housing, employment, and/or public services
to immigrants, regardless of their legal status (authorized or
unauthorized), as well as those encouraging the federal gov-
ernment to enhance border security and/or the identification
and/or apprehension of unauthorized immigrants. Neutral
laws were defined as those that had no discernible restric-
tive/punitive or accommodating/integrative intent.
To assess the reliability of the categories, two coders
separately classified all laws and legislation approved in
2012. Their initial evaluations substantially overlapped (r =
.77. p<.001). Discordant codings most often related to laws
placed in the "Neutral" category. Based on the initial cod-
ing, some clarifications were made to the categories. First,
laws that stipulated clarifications to previously approved
legislation, but that did not change the intent of the original
law were coded as Neutral. Second, human trafficking laws,
Reich 9
whose intent could be construed as both accommodating or
restrictive, were to be classified as "Neutral" unless: (a) they
only contained punitive elements (e.g. punishments for
human trafficking but no assistance for victims of human
trafficking), in which case they were coded as Restrictive; or
(b) they only focused on providing relief to victims of traf-
ficking, in which case they were coded as Accommodating.
Third, laws authorizing or releasing funds for programs pre-
viously approved were coded as "Neutral" provided no
change was made to existing legislation.
Subsequent coding was done separately by each coder
for each legislative year. In instances were coders had
doubts about the proper classification of laws, these were
noted and subsequent discussion among the research team
followed, with the final decision made by the author. For
purposes of the analysis here, "Neutral" were excluded
(these comprised 244 of all laws over all states, or 17.4% of
all laws approved between 2005 and 2012). Thus, the data
analyzed in Table 1 was comprised of 1,149 laws that fell
into the "Accommodating" and "Restrictive" categories.
The three coding categories, and examples of laws placed
into each category, are as follows:
1. Accommodating:
Examples:
- Laws protecting immigrants from fraud, theft, abu-
sive labor/business practices (e.g. a "notary public"
cannot present him/herself as a lawyer) or aiding
immigrants who are victims of some crime. -Laws
that ensure that legal immigrants are not denied
rights or liberties.
- Laws that state that immigrants and/or legal resi-
dents are allowed to practice a profession and/or
acquire a state license.
- Laws that create a state program that targets or
assists immigrants.
2. Restrictive:
Examples:
- Laws that enlist state/local officials in identifying
or apprehending immigrants or create partner-
ships with federal immigration law enforcement
authorities.
- Laws that specifically exclude unauthorized or
authorized immigrants from any state program.
-Laws that specifically exclude unauthorized or
authorized immigrants from any profession or
occupation.
- Laws that mandate verification of immigration sta-
tus for employment or access to state services.
-Laws that defund programs targeted toward
immigrants.
3. Neutral:
Examples:
- Initiation of a cost study or information-gathering
with no predetermined policy objective (either
restrictive or accommodating).
- Allocation of money for an expense incurred as
a result of immigration (either legal or illegal)
or distributions of revenue accrued from
immigrants.
- Human trafficking laws that provided some combi-
nation of penalties for traffickers and assistance to
victims of trafficking.
- Provisions upholding existing legal requirements/
standards (e.g. providing emergency first-aid ser-
vices regardless of immigration status, banning of
discrimination based on race, ethnicity). -Laws stip-
ulating legal or technical clarifications to previ-
ously passed legislation that leave the substance of
that legislation unaltered.
