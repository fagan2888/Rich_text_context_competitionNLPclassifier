Abstract
Limited data are available on the source of usual nutrient intakes in the United States. This analysis aimed to assess
contributions of micronutrients to usual intakes derived from all sources (naturally occurring, fortified and enriched, and
dietary supplements) and to compare usual intakes to the Dietary Reference Intake for U.S. residents aged $2 y according
to NHANES 2003­2006 (n = 16,110). We used the National Cancer Institute method to assess usual intakes of 19
micronutrients by source. Only a small percentage of the population had total usual intakes (from dietary intakes and
supplements) below the estimated average requirement (EAR) for the following: vitamin B-6 (8%), folate (8%), zinc (8%),
thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-12, phosphorus, iron, copper, and selenium (,6% for all). However, more of the
population had total usual intakes below the EAR for vitamins A, C, D, and E (34, 25, 70, and 60%, respectively), calcium
(38%), and magnesium (45%). Only 3 and 35% had total usual intakes of potassium and vitamin K, respectively, greater
than the adequate intake. Enrichment and/or fortification largely contributed to intakes of vitamins A, C, and D, thiamin,
iron, and folate. Dietary supplements further reduced the percentage of the population consuming less than the EAR for all
nutrients. The percentage of the population with total intakes greater than the tolerable upper intake level (UL) was very
low for most nutrients, whereas 10.3 and 8.4% of the population had intakes greater than the UL for niacin and zinc,
respectively. Without enrichment and/or fortification and supplementation, many Americans did not achieve the
recommended micronutrient intake levels set forth in the Dietary Reference Intake. J. Nutr. 141: 1847­1854, 2011.
Introduction
Americans are urged to meet their nutrient needs by consuming
foods that provide a well-balanced, nutrient-dense diet (1,2).
However, many individuals have diets that are lower in one or
more nutrients and higher in energy than recommended (2­10).
The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans identified 4 nutrients
of public concern: dietary fiber, vitamin D, calcium, and potassium.
For certain subgroups in the population, several additional under-
consumed nutrients were also identified: vitamin A, vitamin C,
folate, vitamin K, and magnesium (2).
Most foods contain several naturally occurring nutrients at
relatively low levels. The addition of nutrients to foods, either by
enrichment (replacing nutrients lost in processing) or fortifica-
tion (adding nutrients at higher levels than naturally occur in the
food), enhances levels of one or more nutrients in certain foods
that are widely consumed, thus raising intakes to more desirable
levels. Most grain products are enriched and a variety of other
food products are fortified. For example, bread is enriched with
thiamin, niacin, riboflavin, and iron; most RTE8 cereals are
fortified with added iron and B vitamins, including folate, and
most milk is fortified with vitamin D.
In addition to obtaining nutrients from foods, many Ameri-
cans use nutrient-containing dietary supplements (11,12). Ac-
cording to 2003­2006 NHANES data, one-half of Americans
(aged $1y) used dietary supplements, with multivitamin/min-
eral supplements being the most common (33% of the U.S.
population) (12). Very limited information exists on usual
micronutrient intakes in the U.S. from naturally occurring,
enriched and/or fortified foods, and dietary supplement sources,
with the exception of folate (13).
In Europe, fortified foods do not contribute significantly to
high intakes for any nutrient, and even with the inclusion of
dietary supplements most children and adults do not exceed the

UL (14). Given that fortification practices and dietary supple-
ment use are very different in the U.S. compared to Europe, this
study aimed to determine total usual nutrient intakes for 19
micronutrients from all sources as well as the relative contribu-
tions of foods (including both naturally occurring nutrients and
those added via enrichment and/or fortification) and of dietary
supplements within a nationally representative sample of the
U.S. population aged $2 y.
Participants and Methods
Study population. The NHANES data are collected by the NCHS of
the CDC. All participants or proxies provided written informed consent
and the Research Ethics Review Board at the NCHS approved the survey
protocol. We combined data from NHANES 2003­2004 and 2005­
2006 for these analyses (15). The combined sample included 18,063
participants who had complete 24-h dietary intake data. Of these, 1241
infants or children aged ,2 y and 712 pregnant and/or lactating females
were excluded from the analyses, resulting in 16,110 participants aged
$2 y in the analytic sample (n = 7250 for ages 2­18 y; n = 8860 for ages
$19 y). Participants completed an in-person health examination in a
Mobile Examination Center that included an in-person 24-h dietary
recall. A second 24-h dietary recall was collected via telephone ~3­10 d
after the Mobile Examination Center exam. Both 24-h dietary recalls
were collected using the USDA's automated multiple-pass method.
Nutrients from foods. Various USDA food composition databases
were used to determine the micronutrients derived from foods consumed
by NHANES participants and reported in the 24-h recall dietary
interview. The USDA estimated the nutrient content of NHANES foods
in recipes by linking the ingredients in survey food recipes to food
composition data provided by the SR. The SR-Link file of the FNDDS
version 2.0 was used in conjunction with SR release 18 to determine the
nutrient content of NHANES 2003­2004 foods. FNDDS 3.0 and SR
release 20 were used to determine the composition of foods reported by
NHANES 2005­2006 survey participants (16­19). An addendum to
FNDDS 3.0 provided the vitamin D content of foods reported in
NHANES 2005­2006 (20). Foods reported in NHANES 2003­2004
were matched to the vitamin D addendum, and if there was no match,
recipe calculations were performed using the SR-Link file of the FNDDS
2.0. Because SR releases 18 and 20 did not include the new vitamin D
values, SR release 22 was used (21).
Folate food composition values in the SR and FNDDS were separated
into amounts added as synthetic folic acid compared to food folate (i.e.
folate naturally occurring in food). Added vitamin B-12 and vitamin E
data were also readily available and naturally occurring amounts were
determined by the difference between the total and added vitamin
content of these nutrients. To estimate intakes of all other nutrients that
are added through enrichment and/or fortification of foods, we used
various approaches to separate the nutrient content of foods into
naturally occurring and added components. Data available from the SR
and FNDDS food composition databases as well as the MyPyramid
Equivalent Database 2.0 (22), which gives equivalent amounts of
MyPyramid food groups contained in survey foods, were used to
accomplish this task.
For example, if a food contained synthetic folic acid according to the
FNDDS and grain according to the MyPyramid Equivalent Database and
if the food was not a fortified grain product, such as bread, the recipe was
then examined to determine whether the synthetic folic acid was coming
from enriched flour or another source. We determined the amounts of
added thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, and iron per 100 g of the
enriched grain product by calculating the difference between the
enriched and unenriched SR values. Therefore, given the amount of
added folate per 100 g of the survey food and the proportionate amounts
of folate and other nutrients that were added to the enriched ingredient,
we could also then determine the proportionate amounts of other
nutrients added by enriching the survey food.
We used a different approach to determine the amounts of nutrients
added to fortified grain products, such as RTE cereals and cereal bars. In
this case, the amount of any nutrient added by fortification was obtained
by calculating the difference between the total nutrient content and an
amount determined to be naturally occurring in the food. We assumed
the difference was added by fortification if it exceeded 5% of the Daily
Value (used in food labeling) per serving of the food. Otherwise, it was
assumed to be zero if the difference was a trace amount or ,5% of the
Daily Value/serving, because errors may have been introduced into
calculation by rounding or making assumptions regarding the formula-
tion. The ingredients of the formulation for manufactured foods, such as
RTE cereals and cereal bars, were not listed in the SR-Link of the
FNDDS. Therefore, we used information from the MyPyramid Equiv-
alent Database regarding the cup-equivalent amounts of fruit, nuts, and
grains, combined with the nutrient content of representative SR food
codes in these categories that are typically used as ingredients of RTE
cereals, such as raisins, almonds, and unenriched flour, to separate the
naturally occurring nutrients from fortificants.
The amounts of nutrients added as fortificants to other foods, such as
vitamin C and calcium added to beverages and vitamins A or D added to
margarine or milk, were directly determined by performing recipe
calculations using food composition data and the SR-Link file of the
FNDDS. For example, we separated the fortificants from the vitamins A
or D that would be naturally occurring in milk and for all survey food
recipes that included a specified amount of milk. Using the same
assumptions as the USDA regarding the use of unfortified milk in food
manufacturing, we performed recipe calculations to determine the
proportions of the USDA survey food composition table values that were
derived from the fortification of milk as opposed to the vitamins A or D
naturally occurring in milk, meat, or other ingredients of the mixture.
Based on the above approaches, we were able to generate nutrients
values for all foods that were either naturally occurring or added via
enrichment and/or fortification.
Nutrients from dietary supplements. In conducting the NHANES
2003­2006, a dietary supplement questionnaire was administered
during the household interview to assess usage of vitamins, minerals,
botanicals, and other dietary supplements over the past 30 d (23). For
each dietary supplement the respondent reported, he or she was asked to
report the consumption frequency (i.e. number of days the product was
taken in the past 30 d), the duration (i.e. for how many days, weeks,
months, or years the product was taken), and the amount usually taken
per day on days it was taken in the past 30 d. The interviewer also
examined each dietary supplement container and recorded complete
product information so that every reported dietary supplement could be
matched or entered into a dietary supplements database. The NCHS
maintains a dietary supplements database that contains product label
information obtained from the manufacturers of dietary supplements
reported in NHANES and these data include the labeled dosage or
serving size, ingredients, and the amounts of ingredients per serving. The
average daily intake of nutrients from dietary supplements was calcu-
lated for individuals using the number of days that supplement use was
reported, the reported amount taken per day, and the serving size unit
from the product label.
Estimation of usual intake. Using the food composition data described
above, nutrient intakes from naturally occurring sources were quantified
from each food reported during the individual's two 24-h recall
interviews by multiplying the weight (in grams) of food consumed by
the nutrient content (amount per 100 g). We also estimated nutrient
intake from all foods (including nutrients added via enrichment and/or
fortification) using the same method. To account for differential
bioavailability of folate and folic acid (24), we used the dietary folate
equivalent metric.
Estimates of usual intake for each nutrient were determined using the
National Cancer Institute method (25) for a single dietary component,
because nutrients are consumed at some level on most days. Usual intake
statistics included means and percentiles of intake and probabilities of
meeting or exceeding the DRI for 19 micronutrients (24,26­29). Usual
intakes for nutrients with an established EAR were determined for
thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium,
iron, zinc, copper, and selenium and vitamins A, B-6, B-12, C, D, and E.

Where do Americans get their nutrients? 1849
Additionally, usual intake was determined for 2 nutrients with AI:
vitamin K and potassium. Because the distribution of requirements is
skewed for iron (28), we used the probability method to determine the
prevalence of the population below the EAR. We also determined the
percentages of the population exceeding the UL for nutrients for which
an UL was established, including vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E,
niacin, vitamin B-6, folate, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper,
selenium, vitamin D, and calcium. Because the UL for niacin and
magnesium were established only for supplemental sources (24,26) and
the UL for vitamin A and folate were based on retinol and added folic
acid, respectively (24,28), these were considered when determining
estimates of usual intakes greater than the UL for these nutrients.
Intakes from naturally occurring nutrients and from all foods
(including those enriched and fortified) were determined separately
from total intakes. To determine total nutrient intake, we added nutrient
intake from dietary supplements to the usual intake from all foods
similar to that previously reported (13). Intake data from both 24-h
recalls were used to estimate usual intake from foods. Covariates in the
usual intake models included age groups, day of the week of dietary
recall (weekend/weekday), interview sequence of the dietary recall (in
person vs. via telephone), and dietary supplement use. Thus, we
generated 3 sets of data on micronutrient intakes: 1) naturally occurring
in foods only; 2) from all food sources (including nutrients added via
enrichment and/or fortification); and 3) from all sources (including all
foods and dietary supplements).
Results
Total usual micronutrient intake from all food and sup-
plement sources. The percentage of individuals aged $2 y
with total usual nutrient intake, including that from foods and
dietary supplements, falling below the EAR was considerable for
vitamin D (70%), vitamin E (60%), calcium (38%), vitamin A
(34%), vitamin C (25%), and magnesium (45%) (Table 1). In
contrast, smaller proportions of the population had total usual
intakes below the EAR (in decreasing prevalence) for vitamin
B-6, zinc, folate, iron, thiamin, copper, vitamin B-12, riboflavin,
niacin, and selenium. Less than 3% of the population had total
usual intakes that exceeded the AI for potassium and ~35% of
the population had total usual intake greater than the AI for
vitamin K.
The percentage of the population that exceeded the UL (Table
1) was low for most nutrients (,3% for calcium, iron, and
vitamins D, C, and E; and ~5% and 8% for vitamin A and zinc,
respectively). The sole exception was niacin, in which ~10% of
the population had total usual intakes that exceeded UL.
Comparisons of usual micronutrient intake from various
sources. The percentage of micronutrient intake from foods,
including that from naturally occurring micronutrients and
micronutrients added via enrichment, varied considerably by
micronutrient for individuals aged $2 y (Table 2). Large
percentages of vitamins A, B-6, B-12, C, and D as well as
thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, and iron were from fortifica-
tion and/or enrichment.
The percentage of the population with usual intakes below
the EAR for many micronutrients was much higher when only
naturally occurring nutrients were considered (Fig. 1; Table 1).

When the contribution of micronutrients added to food via
enrichment and/or fortification was also considered, the per-
centage of the population with usual intakes below the EAR was
dramatically reduced for vitamin A (74 to 45%), thiamin (51 to
6%), folate (88 to 11%), and iron (22 to 7%) compared with
usual intakes from only naturally occurring nutrients. In addi-
tion, smaller reductions in the percentage of the population with
usual intakes below the EAR due to enrichment and/or fortifi-
cation were noted for vitamin C (46 to 37%), vitamin B-6 (22 to
12%), and zinc (15 to 11%). When the contribution of dietary
supplements was also considered, the percentage of the total
population (Fig. 1A,B; Table 1) with usual intakes below the
EAR was further reduced for vitamin A (45 to 34%), vitamin C
(37 to 25%), vitamin E (91 to 60%), and magnesium (55 to 45%).
For most micronutrients, only small changes were evident in
the percentage of the total population exceeding the UL when
intakes from enrichment and/or fortification were considered
(Table 1). With the addition of intakes from dietary supple-
ments, the percentage of the total population that exceeded the
UL for vitamin A (2­5%), niacin (1­10%), folate (1­6%), and
zinc (5­8%) further increased (Table 1).
Comparison of age groups. We also examined differences
between children (2­18 y) and adults ($19 y). Large percentages
of children (Supplemental Table 1) with total usual intakes
below the EAR were observed for vitamin D (73%), vitamin E
(66%), calcium (45%), magnesium (34%), vitamin A (25%),
and vitamin C (16%). Similarly, the percentage of adults with
total usual intakes below the EAR (Supplemental Table 2) was
considerable for vitamin D (68%), vitamin E (58%), magnesium
(48%), vitamin A (37%), calcium (36%), and vitamin C (28%).
In children, the percentages of the population with total usual
intake above the UL (Supplemental Table 1) were notable for
zinc (24%), niacin (16%), vitamin A (15%), and folate (15%).
Comparable data in adults were zinc (3%), niacin (94%), vitamin
A (1%), and folate (3%) (Supplemental Table 2). Among children
(Supplemental Table 1; Fig. 2) and adults (Supplemental Table 2;
Fig. 3), substantial percentages of both populations had intakes
less than the EAR when only naturally occurring sources were
considered, but these percentages fell dramatically with the
addition of micronutrients from enriched and/or fortified foods.
In children, the increase in the percentage of the population
that exceeded the UL when including intakes from enrichment
and/or fortification increased for vitamin A (0­6%), niacin (0­
4%), folate (0­4%), and zinc (10­18%) (Supplemental Table 1).
The addition of nutrients from dietary supplements increased
the percentage of children exceeding the UL to even higher levels
for vitamin A (6­15%), niacin (4­16%), folate (4­15%), and
zinc (18­24%).
Discussion
Current dietary guidance recommends that individuals achieve
recommended nutrient intakes from food sources while not
exceeding their energy requirements (1,2). Although all foods
contain some naturally occurring nutrients, naturally nutrient-
dense foods such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, milk,
and lean meats are more likely to help individuals meet their
nutrient needs. Other foods contain both naturally occurring
nutrients and nutrients added through fortification and/or en-
richment. In evaluating total usual intake, most Americans met
their recommended nutrient target for the majority of vitamins
and minerals evaluated; however, far fewer individuals would
have done so without fortification and enrichment. Neverthe-
less, even after accounting for the contributions of fortifica-
tion and/or enrichment and dietary supplements, considerable

1 Data source: NHANES 2003­2006; n = 16,110 using the first 24-h recall. Nutrients in foods consumed as reported in NHANES were
separated into nutrients naturally occurring and those that were added; when possible, added nutrients were further separated into
nutrients added via enrichment and those added via fortification. AT, a-tocopherol; DFE, dietary folate equivalents; RAE, retinol activity
equivalents.
Where do Americans get their nutrients? 1851
percentages of individuals aged $2 y had intakes that were
below the EAR for calcium and vitamin D and very few
consumed the recommended amount of potassium (all nutrients
that the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans singled out as
being of public health concern). Intakes of magnesium and
vitamins A, C, E, and K were also low for a considerable
percentage of the population. Our data suggest that enrichment/
fortification makes a greater contribution in the U.S. compared
to Europe. Flynn et al. (14) reported that nutrients naturally
occurring in foods were the major source of nutrients in most
European countries. This may be because the U.S. fortifies and
enriches foods to a greater extent than most European countries.
In addition to a sizeable percentage of the population who
appeared to have intakes below recommended levels for some
micronutrients, children were also likely to exceed the UL for
certain vitamins and minerals. Children were also more likely to
exceed the UL in Europe as well, with retinol, zinc, and
magnesium specifically mentioned (14). However, the proper
application of UL values for children has been the topic of
considerable debate (30). The UL is the highest level of daily
intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health (24). As
intake increases above the UL, the risk of adverse effects may
increase. However, the UL is based on a risk assessment
approach and it is not recommended to be used as a rigid
standard or cutoff point; other factors must be considered to
assess any possible adverse health effects of intakes exceeding
UL values (24). More research is needed on the adverse health
effects, if any, from intake levels exceeding the UL, especially
because the UL for children for several nutrients, including
folate, zinc, and vitamin A, were based on data with consider-
able limitations, including insufficient dose-response and toxic-
ity data (31­34).
The separation of added nutrients allowed for correct
assessment of certain nutrient intakes above the UL, namely
magnesium and niacin, which without doing so would overes-
timate the percentage of the population with intakes greater
than the UL. In our data, using total niacin intake for UL
purposes (not eliminating the naturally occurring niacin), the
estimate of the population that exceeds the UL was ;50% as
compared to 10% when conducted with only added niacin
intakes.
A major strength of our study is the use of a large nationally
representative population-based sample of children and adults
to assess the source of total usual intake of nutrients with the
National Cancer Institute method. For the first time, to our
knowledge, intakes of micronutrients naturally occurring in
foods and intakes of nutrients contributed by enrichment and/or
fortification were separately determined. One of the limitations
to our study was that both dietary intake and dietary supplement
intake estimates were self-reported and as such were subject to
bias. Additionally, our estimates of naturally occurring nutrients
and nutrients added to foods were approximate given the
assumptions needed to determine these intakes.

In conclusion, most Americans met their needs for many of
the micronutrients examined. However, large percentages of the
population had intakes below the EAR for magnesium and
vitamins A, C, D, and E, and very few individuals obtained the
recommended level of potassium. Compared with intakes from
naturally occurring nutrients, enrichment and/or fortification
dramatically improved intakes of several key nutrients, includ-
ing folate, thiamin, iron, and vitamins A and D. Dietary
supplements added to the intakes of those who used them and
further reduced the percentage of the population below the EAR
for magnesium and vitamins A, C, and E. Intakes from en-
richment and/or fortification and from dietary supplements also
increased the percentage of participants whose intakes exceeded
the UL for niacin, vitamin A, folate, and zinc. The percentage of
individuals exceeding UL for most nutrients was relatively small.
Health professionals must be aware of the contribution that
enrichment and/or fortification and dietary supplements make to
the nutritional status of Americans.
