Older adults, particularly those housebound, are suscepti-
ble to vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency because of
reduced sunlight exposure, inadequate nutrition, dermato-
logical changes, and diminished renal function (Witham
and Francis, 2014). Reduced levels of circulating serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) have been associated
with muscle weakness and reduced bone mineral density
(BMD), along with subsequent falls and fractures leading
to increased nursing home admissions (Weaver et al.,
2010). Chronic deficiency results in osteomalacia (bone
softening; known as rickets in children), osteoporosis
(porous bone), faster turnover of calcium metabolic activ-
ity, and an increase in production of parathyroid hormone
(PTH), which exacerbates the process of weakening bones
(Parfitt et al., 2011; Visser et al., 2003). Vitamin D is also
suspected to be important for maintaining proper immune
system operation and cognitive function (Buell et al., 2010;
Holick, 2004). Vitamin D may also offer a protective factor
in a broad range of diseases such as diabetes, cancer, multi-
ple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia (Buell
et al., 2010; Holick, 2004; Lips, 2001; Sakem et al., 2013).
The US Department of Health and Human Services esti-
mated that one-third of the total US population is at risk due
to insufficient (25(OH)D concentrations between 20 and
30
ng/mL) or deficient (25(OH)D concentrations below
20ng/mL) levels of vitamin D and global estimates are as
high as 40­50
percent for older adults having vitamin D
deficiency (Buell et al., 2009; Laurentani et al., 2010;
Looker et al., 2011; Sakem et al., 2013). Falls and associated
injuries were estimated to cost the US$30
billion in 2010
(Center for Disease Control (CDC), 2014). Significant
public health benefits such as increased quality of life and
years of active life as well as reduced cost and burden of
institutionalized and home direct care could potentially be
realized by fewer falls and related consequences (American
Geriatrics Society Workgroup, 2013).
The vitamin D precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol, is acti-
vated in the skin by ultraviolet light (UVL), usually from
the sun, but intense fluorescent lighting (emitting UV) can
also induce the synthesis of vitamin D (Holick, 1996;
Lips, 2001; Parfitt et al., 2011). The most widely accepted
treatment for insufficient and deficient vitamin D level is
oral supplementation; however, some have noted that this

Abstract
Diminished vitamin D is common among older individuals. Sunlight contributes more to vitamin D synthesis than diet
or supplementation. This study examined associations between objectively measured light exposure, vitamin D serum
levels, and bone biomarkers in 100 men aged over 60years. Light exposure was measured in lux via Actigraph monitors
for 1week. Significantly, greater levels of vitamin D were observed in participants with higher light exposure. Seasonal
differences in lux were also noted. Significant differences in bone markers were not found. Objective measurement of
light exposure is an inexpensive, simple, and effective way to address vitamin D deficiency.

method for addressing the end goals of increasing physi-
cal function and reducing falls may not provide these ben-
efits (Cummings et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2015; Moyer;
U.S. and Preventive Services Task Force, 2013). While
dietary intake and supplementation augment production
of vitamin D and provide a sparring effect, light exposure
has been documented to provide as much as 90percent of
an individual's vitamin D requirement (Hall et al., 2010;
Holick, 2004; Lips, 2001; Lips et al., 2014). However, the
amount of light exposure necessary to positively affect
25(OH)D levels varies based on personal circumstances
(Holick, 2004; Lips, 2001; Lips et al., 2014). Latitudinal
location and time of year are two major determinants of
vitamin D production. Those living in more northern loca-
tions may experience virtually no vitamin D production
for nearly half of the year (Lips, 2001). Production is also
heavily determined by skin composition as well. Vitamin
D production is higher in lightly pigmented skin com-
pared to heavily pigmented skin (Lips, 2001). Furthermore,
the skin in senior adults can continue to produce the pre-
cursors of vitamin D, but research shows that this organ
no longer does so as efficiently as during youth because of
reduced 7-dehydrocholesterol levels (American Geriatrics
Society Workgroup, 2013; MacLaughlin and Holick,
1985; Sakem et al., 2013). Also, in an effort to reduce skin
cancer, public health organizations have given blanket
recommendations to limit sun exposure and increase use
of sunscreen, which could be reducing population levels
of 25(OH)D (Sinha et al., 2013). It has been suggested
that a minimal "10-min exposure of head and arms (unpro-
tected) three times per week is adequate to prevent vita-
min D deficiency" or "doses small enough to produce
only minimal tanning" can create beneficial increases in
25(OH)D (Armas et al., 2007; Lips, 2001).
Current research has not consistently demonstrated ben-
eficial effects or reduced risk of disease and falls in the
older population with the exclusive use of oral vitamin D
supplementation (Bolland et al., 2014; Hansen et al., 2015).
However, despite continued debate on the role of supple-
mentation in producing various positive outcomes, there is
little doubt that sunshine is the most important contributor
to healthy vitamin D levels (Autier et al., 2014; Theodoratou
et al., 2014). Research in objective monitoring of light
exposure in respect to vitamin D and bone markers may
yield valuable insight into diagnostic and treatment proto-
cols in the older population.
One of the routinely used means of collecting outdoor
activity and light exposure is via sunlight exposure ques-
tionnaires. Advantages of these instruments include low
cost, fairly uncomplicated administration, and standardiza-
tion (Falk and Anderson, 2012). However, questionnaires
may provide imprecise measurement of vitamin D status
due to the wide variety of personal factors that inhibit vita-
min D production, such as sunscreen use, clothing material,
and melanin pigment (Cargill et al., 2013; McCarty, 2008).
Wearable light detection monitors have the potential to
become valuable objective tools whose benefits include
cost effectiveness, small size, and light weight, practicality
in participants' natural environments, and allowance for
monitoring over long-term periods (Martin and Hakim,
2011). This method is also an effective means of reducing
recall and reporting bias that could negatively impact the
data.
Previous research to determine a correlation between
objectively measured light in lux (one lumen per square
meter) and serum 25(OH)D levels has been limited and
yielded mixed results. Calogiuri et al. (2013) found no
significant differences in vitamin D levels for those in an
outdoor versus indoor activity group but did find a small
positive correlation between vitamin D levels and objec-
tively measured light exposure. Their participant group
was limited in size (14), and the timetable between light
exposure and blood draws being less than 24hours post-
exposure may have been too short to have demonstrated
a significant difference in vitamin D levels. In another
similar study, researchers in Korea were unable to con-
firm a relationship between serum 25(OH)D and sunlight
measured by objective means; however, they noted
a small sample size (20 women) and low compliance
with outdoor activity due to cold weather during their
November collection period as potential limiting factors
(Lee et al., 2012).
Clearly, institutionalized and/or housebound elderly
individuals are at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.
So, what is the likelihood of vitamin D deficiency or
insufficiency in an older population if they are relatively
active? The Robert E. Mitchell Center for Prisoner of
War Studies had a unique opportunity to measure light
exposure in a prior research project where activity and
sleep were measured, and lux was included. We sought to
identify in the same cohort of 120 older men whether
light levels, measured by lux as a feature of ActiGraph
accelerometer monitors, correlated with vitamin D and
associated bone metabolic biomarkers.
Methods
Participants
The participants were a subset of Vietnam-era repatriated
prisoners of war (RPWs) from all branches of services, as
well as a matched comparison group (CG) of combat veter-
ans (who had been in similar combat but were never cap-
tured/imprisoned). They have been voluntary contributors
to the Robert E. Mitchell Center for Prisoner of War studies
annual medical and psychological follow-up program
within the Department of Defense since 1973. Their ages
range from 61 to 86
years (mean
=
73, standard deviation
(SD)=5). This study comprises 100 participants (76 RPWs
and 24 CGs) who took part in medical follow-up at the
Fields et al. 3
Center between May 2012 and June 2013. Participants
reported being in good physical health for their ages and
were able to travel to the Mitchell Center in Pensacola,
Florida, to engage in the study. Their average grip strength
was above normal (45
kg) and their comfortable walking
gait was on par with their age group (1.3m/s) (Bohannon,
1997; Massey-Westropp et al., 2011). The majority of them
were free from psychological diagnoses (76 participants).
They supplied actigraphy and lux data and had a vitamin D
assay collected as part of their routine medical follow-up.
The other 20 from the original study (Fields et al., 2015)
were omitted because they did not have a vitamin D assay
collected at the time of actigraphy collection. Particulars of
this cohort have been previously published (Segovia et al.,
2013). This study was reviewed and approved by an institu-
tional review board, and all participants included in this
research have consented to being included in the study.
Lux meters
ActiGraphTM GT3X+ monitors (ActigraphTM; LLC,
Pensacola, FL, USA) with lux meters were used to gather
exposure to light in our participants. These actigraphy mon-
itors include triaxial accelerometers that identify move-
ment, steps, kilocalories, as well as lux. The monitors have
512MB of memory and activity and light collection
occurred at 30Hz. Participants wore the monitor for seven
consecutive days and nights on their non-dominant wrist.
Typical lux level estimates for the GT3X+ were as follows
(Table 1).
Procedures
Blood samples were obtained as part of routine clinical
practice, which included serum vitamin D, and other rele-
vant bone biomarker data (calcium, phosphorous, and alka-
line phosphatase). Actigraphy monitors with lux meters
were scheduled to turn on when participants returned home.
Lux levels were collected for 7days and nights from 92 of
the 100 participants. Of the remaining eight participants,
seven wore the ActiGraph for 6days, and therefore, lux was
gathered for only those 6days, and one participant wore the
ActiGraph for only 4days. These eight had forgotten to put
on the device at the designated time.
Data analysis
A vitamin D assay of 30­100
ng/mL is widely considered
within normal limits. Using this criterion as a cut point for
normal (30ng/mL) and abnormal (<30ng/ml) vitamin D
levels, the data were divided into these two groupings to
compare average daily light (in lux) exposure collected
from the ActiGraph and the associated bone metabolic bio-
markers. Since it took a year to collect this amount of data,
seasonal differences had to be accounted for as well. The
data were divided into the four seasons based on the official
calendar start of the season in the northern hemisphere (i.e.
fall, 21 September; winter, 21 December; spring, 21 March;
summer, 21 June).
Results
Descriptive statistics of seasonal quartiles and mean lux
illustrated differences in mean lux levels, particularly for
fall and winter (see Table 2). A Bonferroni post-hoc alpha
adjusted to p=.0125 (for four comparisons) indicated that
winter lux levels were significantly lower than summer lev-
els (p=.0001; large effect size=1.75), and fall levels were
significantly lower than summer levels (p=.011; large
effect size
=
.803); but, spring versus winter was not sig-
nificant because of the adjusted alpha for multiple com-
parisons. There were no significant differences between
remaining seasonal levels (see Table 3).
Descriptive statistics of vitamin D cut points between
normal and abnormal serum levels showed mean lux differ-
ences (see Table 4). Independent t tests demonstrated statis-
tically significant differences in mean lux levels between
the two groups, t(98)=2.53, p=.013. This difference was
moderate in effect size (Cohen's d=.51). The analysis of
variance (ANOVA) for vitamin D by normal/abnormal lev-
els was found to be significant (F(1, 98)=6.38, p=.013,
small effect size=.03) (Table 5).

Descriptive statistics of seasonal mean lux and vitamin
D cut points between normal and abnormal serum levels
illustrated some mean lux differences (see Graph 1).
However, with the exception of the fall season, independent
t-tests demonstrated no significant differences in mean lux
levels between the two vitamin D groupings. Fall sea-
son's significant mean lux difference between the two
groups demonstrated a large effect size (Cohen's d=1.27).

The ANOVA for vitamin D by the four seasonal levels
was found to be significant (F(3, 96)=7.36, p=.0001)
(Table 6).
Descriptive statistics of the associated bone metabolic
biomarkers showed no differences in the mean levels
between the normal and abnormal vitamin D groupings,
with the exception of possibly alkaline phosphatase.
However, independent t-tests showed no statistically sig-
nificant differences in any of these bone metabolic markers
(calcium, t(98)=1.50, p=.137; phosphorous, t(98)=.913,
p=.364; alkaline phosphatase, t(79.6)=1.50, p=.138).
Discussion
For this cohort, sunlight exposure translated into signifi-
cantly higher levels of vitamin D, which is congruent with
previous research. This finding was expected since there is
a direct correlation between exposure to ultraviolet B
(UVB) and serum concentrations of vitamin D. While the
associations were not robust across all potential interac-
tions between objectively collected light and vitamin D val-
ues, some of the associations were significant and indicate
that further evaluation within a larger and more controlled
design is prudent. A broad range of personal factors could
have influenced the data including diet, clothing choice,
and sunscreen use.
While there is no globally accepted stratum defining
vitamin D values, a vitamin D assay of 30­100
ng/mL is
commonly considered within normal limits. Using this cri-
terion as a cut point for normal and abnormal vitamin D
levels and comparing with average daily light (in lux)
exposure collected from ActiGraph monitors, this study
was able to partially establish anticipated seasonal differ-
ences in lux levels with winter and fall lux rates signifi-
cantly lower than summer. These differences may be based
upon seasonal sunlight variations as well as more amenable
weather conditions that contribute to extended outdoor
exposure.Also observed was an overall interaction between
objectively measured sunlight with serum vitamin D levels
showing that participants with abnormal vitamin D levels
had significantly less average daily light exposure com-
pared to those within normal limits of vitamin D. A signifi-
cant increase in both lux values and vitamin D were
observed during the fall season only. Contrary to expecta-
tion, the light exposure and vitamin D interaction was not
significant across all seasons nor was it associated with
bone metabolic markers.
Limitations
The use of a cohort of aged Caucasian men from a high
socioeconomic status restricts the ability to generalize
results to the average US population. Also, there were no
data collected on diet, nutritional supplementation, or sun-
screen use for the participants. Additionally, serum PTH
levels may have provided additional insight but were not
part of the routine laboratory tests. Finally, this study is a
cross-sectional study, and causality cannot be determined.
Despite these constraints, it is important to note that our
findings are similar to results observed in previous research
demonstrating the importance of continued research into
objectively measured sunlight on the production of vitamin
D and overall bone health.
Conclusion
With a large portion of the US population diagnosed with
abnormal vitamin D levels and associated costs of fall-
related injuries estimated in the billions of dollars, it is
important to explore all available avenues of diagnosis and
treatment of abnormal vitamin D. Today's advances in
technology have contributed to the production of smaller
and less invasive personal health monitoring devices; the
use of light meters to objectively obtain personal data on
light exposure could offer healthcare providers, patients,
and caregivers an opportunity to reliably evaluate reduced
sunlight as a potential impediment to positive overall
health. They could also provide a uniquely accurate and
reliable tool for treatment and evaluation of any benefits
received by sunlight therapy. Future research of vitamin D
levels in older populations would benefit from the contin-
ued use of objectively measured sunlight exposure while
controlling for such factors as dietary and supplementation
intake of vitamin D as well as sunscreen use.
