Background We analyse the NHANES III sample to assess the suitability of
measured stature and sitting height to estimate leg length
(tibia þ femur) and predict fatness. High rates of overweight in
the United States population may lead to greater gluteo-femoral fat
mass which will increase sitting height and artificially decrease
estimates of both absolute and relative leg length.
Methods The analyses include 3076 women and 3233 men, 20.0­49.9 years of
age of White, Black or Mexican-American ethnicity. The poverty
index ratio, measured stature, sitting height, upper leg length,
weight, four skinfolds, buttocks circumference and elbow, biacro-
mial and biiliac breadths were extracted from the database. The
sitting height ratio, % body fatness, % upper leg length (ULL/
stature), and other indices were estimated. Correlation and
principle component analysis were used to assess the relationship
between measures of body fatness, relative leg length and the other
variables.
Results For adults in the NHANES III % body fat is more strongly
correlated with buttocks circumference (r ¼ 0.87 and 0.78 for
women and men), than with any measure of estimated leg length
(r's range from À0.28 to À0.10 for both sexes). Principle
components analysis separates fatness, stature and estimated leg
length into uncorrelated factors for this sample.
Conclusion Reports of a negative association between leg length and fatness for
adults of the NHANES III are likely spurious, due to greater gluteo-
femoral fat thickness increasing sitting height. Future rounds of the
NHANES, and similar surveys in other nations with high body fat
populations, should measure lower extremity length directly to
better assess its relationship to health and disease risk.

length or the sitting height ratio [sitting height/
stature]) are used as epidemiological markers of risk
for overweight (fatness), coronary heart disease,
diabetes and certain cancers.6­8 There is also wide
support for the use of relative leg length as an
indicator of the quality of the environment for
growth during infancy, childhood and the juvenile
years of development.9­19 Human beings follow a
cephalo-caudal gradient of growth, the pattern of
growth common to all mammals. A special feature
of the human pattern is that after birth the legs
grow relatively faster than other post-cranial body
segments.20 For groups of children and youth,
short stature due to relatively short legs (i.e. a high
sitting height ratio) is a marker of an adverse
environment.21
The United States Third National Health and
Examination Survey of 1988­1994 (the NHANES III)
is the most recent national sample to include
measures of both stature and sitting height (length
of the body from buttocks to crown of the head),
which allows the estimation of leg length via
subtraction, leg length ¼ (stature ­ sitting height),
and the estimation of relative leg length via sitting
height ratio (SHR ¼ sitting height/stature Â 100). The
lower the SHR values the longer are the legs in
proportion to total stature.
Analyses of the NHANES III data report that US
adults with relatively shorter legs have more body fat,
greater insulin resistance and greater prevalence of
diabetes than Americans with relatively longer
legs.22,23
These findings may not be quite accurate. In the
NHANES III, 57.4% of men and 56.4% of women
aged 20.0­49.9 years old are overweight or obese
(using the US Center for Disease Control cutoff points
for the body mass index: BMI ¼ 25.0­29.9 is over-
weight and a BMI ¼ 30 þ is obese). Given this level
of fatness, it is possible that the accumulation of
buttocks fat (gluteo-femoral fat) may underestimate
and obscure accurate estimations of leg length.
Several studies have measured subcutaneous fat
thickness above the gluteal muscle by computed
tomography scanning.24­26 Some subjects in these
studies have nearly 9 cm of subcutaneous buttocks
fat. In one of these studies, greater body fatness,
as assessed by BMI is shown to be positively
correlated with supergluteal fat thickness (r ¼ 0.51,
P < 0.01, n ¼ 25 men).25 While subcutaneous fat is
compressible, a thicker gluteo-femoral fat mass will
increase sitting height and artificially decrease both
absolute and relative leg length. Spurious associations
between measures of sitting height and leg length on
the one hand, and leg length-based risks for fatness
and metabolic disease on the other hand, are likely.
In this article we analyse the NHANES III sample to
assess the reliability of the sitting height ratio as a
proxy for leg length in adult men and women when
corrected for estimated supragluteal fatness.
Methods
Population
The NHANES is a periodic survey conducted by the
U.S. National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The NHANES III, 1988­94 was the seventh in a
series of these surveys. The survey is based on a
complex, multi-stage sampling plan, designed to
provide national estimates of the health and nutri-
tional status of the United States' civilian, non-
institutionalized population in the 50 states and the
District of Columbia.
Study design
The major design parameters of the NHANES III have
been described elsewhere.27 In NHANES III, 39 695
persons, aged 2 years and older, were selected over
the 6 years. The NHANES identifies subjects by sex,
age, ethnicity and by the poverty income ratio, an
index of family income relative to the poverty level
adjusted for family size for a given year. `Race/
ethnicity' was self-reported for adults. The NHANES
III defined four `race/ethnic' groups: Non-Hispanic
White, Non-Hispanic Black, Mexican-American and
Other. There are too few of these `Other' individuals
for useful analysis.
`Race/ethnic' codes are social categories and not well
defined genetic or biological groups (www.aaanet.org/
stmts/racepp.htm). Nevertheless, U.S. Blacks have, on
average, relatively longer legs than Whites and
Mexican-Americans.28,29 The causes of these group
differences in relative leg length are not well under-
stood.12 The existence of these group differences
requires analysis by `race/ethnic' groups.
Measures
Ethnicity/race is self reported by the participants in the
survey as White, Black or Mexican-American.
Sex (female or male) is self reported by the
participants in the survey.
Age at interview, in years (Age) was calculated from
date of birth and the date of interview.
Poverty income ratio is computed as a proportion of
two components. The numerator is the midpoint of
the observed family income category reported in
the Family Questionnaire of the NHANES III. The
denominator is the poverty threshold, based on the
age of the family reference person, and the calendar
year in which the family was interviewed. The poverty
threshold values (in dollars) are produced annually by
the U.S. Census Bureau and are adjusted for inflation.
Anthropometry measurement protocols are available.27
Standing height and sitting height were measured
directly to the nearest 0.10 cm. Leg length was
calculated by subtracting sitting height from stand-
ing height. Additional anthropometry used in the
present analysis includes weight, four skinfolds
(subscapular, triceps, suprailiac, thigh), upper leg

length (femur length), biiliac breadth (maximum
breadth of the hips at the highest point of the iliac
crests), biacromial breadth (maximum breadth of the
shoulders across the lateral borders of the acromial
processes), elbow breadth (greatest breadth across the
epicondyles of the humerus at the elbow) and
buttocks circumference (maximum circumference of
the hips). The body breadths are included as a control
for body shape and as a measure of frame size, an
important variable associated with body fatness.30
Percentage body fat was calculated using the
formulas of Peterson et al. 31, which assume a four-
compartment model of body composition. For men
the formula is: % body fat ¼ 20.94878 þ (age Â 0.1166)
À (height Â 0.11666) þ (sum4 Â 0.42696) À (sum42 Â
0.00159). For women the formula is: % body
fat ¼ 22.18945 þ (age Â 0.06368) þ (BMI Â 0.60404) À
(height Â 0.14520) þ (sum4 Â 0.30919) À (sum42 Â
0.00099562). In both formulas the term `Sum4' is
the sum of the triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and
midthigh skinfolds. In the formula for women the
term `BMI' is the body mass index (weight in kg/
height in m2).
As our measure of relative leg length we use the
sitting height ratio. We feel this is more appropriate
than using estimated leg length [i.e. (stature ­ sitting
height)]. The sitting height ratio gives the percentage
of total stature that is due to the length of the head,
neck and trunk of the body and, therefore, partially
corrects for the stature variation within the sample.
The sitting height ratio is a better descriptor of body
shape than stature or leg length.12 Moreover, if
buttocks fatness biases the measurement of sitting
height then it also biases the estimate of calculated
leg length. It seems better to analyse a ratio of the
direct measurements of height and sitting height
rather than a calculated estimate of leg length.
We compute % upper leg length, % biiliac breadth,
% biacromial breadth, % elbow breadth and % but-
tocks circumference by dividing each variable by
standing height (e.g. buttocks circumference in cm/
height in cm). BMI, an index of weight-for-height, is
also included in our analyses. Relating these variables
to stature allows for common comparison of lengths,
breadths, mass and circumferences.32,33
Study sample and statistical analysis
A study sample of 6282 participants 20­49 years of
age (3220 men and 3062 women) with data for all of
the variables was extracted. We chose this age range
to avoid the effects of growth, development and
maturation for younger people. We also wish to avoid
age-related changes for older adults in stature and
sitting height, which in the NHANES III sample tend
to decrease after age 50 relatively rapidly compared
with younger adults (analysis not shown here, see
also ref.34). Age 50 years is also a convenient cut-off
point for fatness changes in the NHANES III sample.
Summarizing our analyses of age changes in fatness
(not shown here), women tend to increase to age 60
years, but slowly after age 50. Fatness in men tends to
increase relatively rapidly to age 40 years, more slowly
to age 60 years, and then stabilize to age 90.
In Table 1 the distribution of participants by
ethnicity (White, Black and Mexican-American) and
sex along with the means and standard deviations for
age, height, sitting height, % body fat are presented.
The maximum number of men and women for any
single variable totals 9023 cases. The study sample
does not differ in terms of mean values for age,
stature, sitting height or % body fat from the total
database (P40.05). The study sample of women
has smaller mean buttocks circumference and lower
% buttocks circumference (P < 0.01). This might bias
results against our hypothesis that gluteo-femoral
fat thickness causes an underestimate of relative leg
length.
Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to
provide a simple measure of association between each
of the variables. Due to relatively large number of
correlations, and the possible multicollinearity (linear
dependence) between many of these variables it may
be difficult to understand the underlying biological
structure of the data set. Principle component analysis
was used to extract uncorrelated sets of variables
(i.e. factors), reduce the number of variables, and to

FATNESS BIASES RELATIVE LEG LENGTH IN NHANES III 203
detect structure in the relationships between
variables.
In our statistical analysis we use the reported data
without any sample weights or other adjustments.
Such weighting and adjustment is needed when the
NHANES III data are used to estimate national
prevalence and rates. In the present analysis the
data are treated as a sample of convenience.
Results
We begin the presentation of results by assuming that
the sitting height ratio is an accurate proxy for
relative leg length. In Figure 1 we show the relation-
ship of means for sitting height ratio according to
quartiles of % body fat for adult women. Quartile 1 is
the lowest and quartile 4 the highest % body fat.
Similar data for men are shown in Figure 2. In
women, all three ethnic groups show increases in
sitting height ratio (relatively shorter leg length) with
increases in % body fat (P < 0.001). For men, Blacks
and Mexican-Americans show increases in sitting
height ratio with increases in % body fat (P < 0.01),
but Whites do not. Results of this type, that adults in
the NHANES III with relatively longer legs have lower
body fatness and lower BMI are reported in the
literature cited previously.
The association between relative leg length and
% body fat is reduced and less direct if additional
variables are considered simultaneously. Presented in
Table 2 is a correlation matrix for the set of variables
considered here for women and men. The correlation
coefficients (r) for sitting height ratio and % body fat
are 0.23 for women and 0.29 for men. For % upper leg
length and % body fat the r for both men and women
is À0.10. While the signs of these correlations are in
the expected direction (greater % body fat with
relatively shorter legs) these are small-to-modest
correlations given the sample size. In contrast, the r
values for correlations between % body fat, BMI and
% buttock circumference range from 0.87 to 0.91 for
women and 0.77­0.91 for men, indicating that these
three variables are strongly associated. Percentage
buttocks circumference has very little association with
% upper leg length (r ¼ À0.04 for both sexes), but a
modest association with sitting height ratio (r ¼ 0.25
for women and r ¼ 0.32 for men). The measurement
of buttocks circumference and upper leg length are
independent in terms of technique. In contrast, the
measurement of sitting height includes some amount
of gluteo-femoral tissue that also contributes to
buttocks circumference.
Principle component analysis results for women
and men are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.
For women, four factors have eigenvalues greater
than 1.0. Factor 1, accounting for 34.68% of the
variance in the dataset, is composed of loadings 40.70
for % body fat, % biiliac breadth, % elbow breadth,
% buttocks circumference and BMI. The choice of a
`critical level' for factor loadings is arbitrary. Some
sources suggest values greater than 0.50.35 We chose
0.70 because it is more conservative and recom-
mended by the software (STATISTICA) used in our
analysis.36 The negative signs of the loadings may be
ignored as they are all negative, and only the relative
size of the loading is important. This seems to be a
body fatness/body breadth factor. Factor 2, with
loadings for sitting height and standing height
(15.36% of the variance), seems to be a linear skeletal
dimension factor. Factor 3 is comprised of relative leg
length, both the sitting height ratio and % upper leg
length. The opposite signs for these loadings indicate
that adults with greater sitting height ratio have, as
expected, relatively shorter femurs. Factor 4 is the
Poverty income ratio.
For men, five factors have eigenvalues41.0. Factor 1
(28.46% of the total variance) is composed of
% body fat, % biiliac breadth, % buttocks

circumference and BMI. This seems to be a body
fatness/lower body breadth factor. Factors 2 and 3 are
essentially the same as for women. Factor 4 is Age
and factor 5 is Poverty income ratio.
Discussion
The results of the principle components analyses
indicate that fatness, and measures of body breadth
correlated with fatness, comprise the factor which
dominates the anthropometric structure of the
NHANES III sample of adults. The `fatness/body
breadth' factor is not correlated with the `linear
size,' or `relative leg length' factors in the NHANES
III sample. Accordingly, the reported relationship
between relative leg length and fatness in the
literature, and the one we show in Figures 1 and 2
are, at least partly, spurious associations that arise
from sources of bias not measured in a simple
analysis.
Within factor 1, the strong correlation between
% body fat and % buttocks circumference suggests
that the thickness of buttocks fat is one source of bias.
We are not aware of any studies that divide buttocks
circumference into anatomical regions of fat. One
published report finds a positive association between
BMI and subcutaneous supragluteal fat thickness.25

FATNESS BIASES RELATIVE LEG LENGTH IN NHANES III 205
This study measured 25 men and 25 women (30%
overweight and 14% obese) undergoing medical proce-
dures that called for a pelvic region CT scan at a hospital
in Ireland.
Aside from the published analyses of the NHANES
III sample,22,23 only two other studies address the
relationship between variation in sitting height ratio
and body fatness in adults. One is an analysis of 669
Brazilian women, which finds that individuals with
relatively shorter legs carry significantly more body fat
than women with relatively longer legs.37 The authors
measured height and sitting height to calculate sitting
height ratio. Buttocks circumference was also mea-
sured but not included in their regression analysis, so
it is possible that gluteo-femoral fat thickness biases
the results to some extent. The second study is of 30
Spanish women, 35­55 years old.38 No relationship
was found between % body fat and height, trunk
length or leg length. Measurement protocol is not
reported, so it is possible that leg length is estimated.
The small sample size may obscure important
relationships.
Factor 3 of the principle component analysis
includes sitting height ratio and % upper leg length.
It is expected that these measure of relative leg length
would be strongly, and negatively, correlated if
buttocks fatness were not a bias, but less strongly
correlated if sitting height is biased and upper
leg length is not. The strong association in the
NHANES III sample may indicate that both measures
of relative leg length are biased by fatness. The
method for measuring upper leg length used in
the NHANES III requires palpating the knee to find
the patella-femur junction, drawing a line across
the knee at this junction, measuring from the mid-
point of this line to the mid-point of the inguinal
crease (the junction of the thigh with the lower
abdomen when the participant is seated). The
NHANES III manual instructs anthropometrists that,
`No pressure is to be applied at the inguinal crease;
however, folds of fat tissue may have to be lifted on
some obese SP's [subject persons] to measure at
the crease' 27 (pp. 3­9). Applying `no pressure' to a
fat-filled inguinal crease will underestimate true
femur length.
Living conditions and growth trends in
the United States
The principle component analysis finds that the
poverty index ratio accounts for about 8% of the
variance for both women and men in the data set. In
the United States, sub-optimal nutrition and relatively
frequent disease are more common for children and
adults of lower income families, of recent immigration
from other countries, for unemployed and under-
employed families, and minority ethnic groups.39,40
A recent report41 indicates that since 1975 the United
States born populations show a modest increase in
mean stature for Whites and no increase for Blacks.
These trends in height are in contrast to western
European populations showing stronger positive
trends in stature during the same period. The authors
suggest the patterns of height growth in the United
States may be attributable to the unequal distribution
of health care and, `. . . the relatively weak welfare
safety net' (p. 283). Indeed, this same report states
that the United States has the greatest income
disparity, as measured by the Gini coefficient, of any
of the industrialized nations. Body weight and
fatness, of course, have increased at a rapid rate for
the United States adult population during this same
period,42,43 and the burden of the overweight/obesity
epidemic falls heaviest on those with a lower poverty
income ratio.44

A negative relationship between sitting height ratio
and the poverty index ratio for children and youth of
the NHANES III is reported.45 Fatness in these
children and youth may bias this relationship, since
those with relatively shorter legs also have greater
sum of four skinfolds.23 Even so, it is possible that
the relatively short-legged children from families with
a lower poverty index ratio do, in fact, have reduced
leg growth. These lower income children may become
adults with shorter stature, reduced relative leg length
and greater risk for fatness and metabolic disease.46
Conclusion
There seems to be a significant bias when leg length
and relative leg length (e.g. sitting height ratio) are
estimated from stature and sitting height in popula-
tions with high percentage of overweight and obesity.
In such populations, the relation of leg length to body
fatness, and hence disease risk, will be overestimated.
Future rounds of the NHANES, and similar surveys
in other nations with high body fat populations,
should measure lower extremity length directly.
Measuring lower leg length is especially important
as the tibia is more sensitive to changes in the health
environment than is the femur or the long bones of
the arm.47­48
It is easier to measure sitting height than leg length.
In part this is because there is no consensus for
choosing the appropriate anatomical landmarks. Two
common methods for measuring upper and lower leg
length are to have the person stand and measure
subischial length (the perpendicular distance from
pubic symphysis to the floor) or greater trochanter
height (the perpendicular distance from the lateral
margin of the greater trochanter of the femur to the
floor). Palpating these landmarks in overweight and
obese individuals may be difficult, time consuming
and possibly embarrassing. Nevertheless, more direct
measurement of leg length is called for to better
assess its epidemiological value as a marker for health
and disease risk and to track changes over time as an
indicator of the effectiveness of health and nutrition
policy and practice.

We thank Nada Beydoun for assistance in the
organization of the NHANES III database prior to
analysis. Prof. Robert Malina suggested a possible
association between gluteal fatness and sitting height
that sparked the idea for this analysis.

KEY MESSAGES
For adults aged 20­49 years:
 Estimates of relative leg length based upon measured stature and sitting height are biased in
populations with high levels of body fatness.
 Fatness, linear height/sitting height, relative leg length and socioeconomic level (as measured by the
poverty index ratio) are uncorrelated principle components in the NHANES III database. This seems to
be due to the high level of fatness in this sample across all `race/ethnic,' sex, socioeconomic and age
groups.
 Low socioeconomic status may reduce leg length in children and lead to greater fatness and metabolic
disease in adulthood. This possibility should be explored using direct measurements of upper (femur)
and lower (tibia) leg length.
