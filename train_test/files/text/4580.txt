ABSTRACT
AxD (Alexander disease) is a rare disorder caused by het-
erozygous mutations in GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein)
resulting in accumulation of the GFAP protein and elevation
of Gfap mRNA. To test whether GFAP itself can serve as a
biomarker of disease status or progression, we investigated
two independent measures of GFAP expression in AxD mouse
models, one using a genetic reporter of promoter activity and
the other quantifying GFAP protein directly in a manner that
could also be employed in human studies. Using a trans-
genic reporter line that expresses firefly luciferase under the
control of the murine Gfap promoter (Gfap-luc), we found
that luciferase activity reflected the regional CNS (central
nervous system) variability of Gfap mRNA in Gfap+ / + mice,
and increased in mice containing a point mutation in Gfap
that mimics a common human mutation in AxD (R239H in
the human sequence, and R236H in the murine sequence).
In a second set of studies, we quantified GFAP protein in CSF
(cerebrospinal fluid) taken from three different AxD mouse
models and littermate controls. GFAP levels in CSF were in-
creased in all three AxD models, in a manner corresponding
to the concentrations of GFAP in brain. These studies demon-
strate that transactivation of the Gfap promoter is an early
and sustained indicator of the disease process in the mouse.
Furthermore, GFAP in CSF serves as a potential biomarker
that is comparable between mouse models and human
patients.

INTRODUCTION
AxD (Alexander disease) is a rare neurodegenerative disor-
der caused by heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding
GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), the major intermediate
filament protein of astrocytes (Brenner et al., 2001). The mu-
tations appear to act in a gain-of-function fashion, with a rise
in GFAP levels above a toxic threshold serving as a key step in
pathogenesis (Brenner et al., 2009). However, the mecha-
nisms underlying the accumulation of GFAP are not com-
pletely understood. Studies from cell culture models impli-
cate impaired degradation through the proteasomal pathway
as one cause of GFAP increase, despite a near simultaneous
increase in autophagy (Tang et al., 2006, 2008). In addition,
analysis of both human tissues and mouse models reveal
increases in GFAP mRNA (Hagemann et al., 2005, 2006), sug-
gesting that increased synthesis could also contribute to an
accumulation of GFAP protein. Given the very slow turnover
rate for GFAP protein (Chiu and Goldman, 1984; Morrison
et al., 1985; DeArmond et al., 1986; Price et al., 2010), any
changes in GFAP promoter activity and increased synthe-
sis would have long-lasting effects. GFAP accumulation may
also exacerbate pathology through the formation of positive
feedback loops that impact both synthesis and degradation
(Messing et al., 2012).
Regulation of GFAP expression occurs primarily at the
level of GFAP transcription, rather than through alterations
in mRNA stability or translational efficiency (Brenner, 1994).
Whether the changes in GFAP mRNA noted above reflect
feedback stimulation of Gfap promoter activity is not known.

Methods for investigating promoter activity in vivo have been
greatly facilitated by the development of transgenic models
that carry reporter genes under the control of cell-specific
regulatory elements (Cui et al., 1994). One such reporter is
the Gfap-luc mouse, which expresses the firefly luciferase
gene under the control of a 12 kb 5 flanking region from
the murine Gfap gene (Zhu et al., 2004). These mice have
previously been shown to exhibit increases in luciferase ac-
tivity in response to a variety of insults or diseases that also
result in astrogliosis and raised levels of GFAP mRNA, includ-
ing kainic acid-induced seizures (Zhu et al., 2004), bacterial
infection (Kadurugamuwa et al., 2005), inflammation (Luo
et al., 2008), stroke (Cordeau et al., 2008), scrapie (Tamg¨
uney
et al., 2009), motor neuron degeneration (Keller et al., 2009)
and expression of mutant APP (amyloid precursor protein)
(Watts et al., 2011).
With the goal of identifying indicators of disease sever-
ity and progression that could be easily monitored in mouse
models of AxD, we sought to test whether the Gfap-luc re-
porter is responsive to the novel genetic injury represented by
the expression of mutant GFAP. We also tested the hypothe-
sis that the elevations in GFAP protein previously detected in
brain parenchyma are also reflected at the level of CSF (cere-
brospinal fluid), a site that is readily amenable to biopsy in hu-
man patients and in which increased GFAP has been observed
in AxD patients (Kyllerman et al., 2005). We found distinct
variations in GFAP expression and response to AxD mutations
in different brain regions of the mouse models. Increased ac-
tivity from the Gfap-luc reporter is evident at the whole
brain level as soon as 14 days after birth and this increase is
sustained through at least 6 months of age. We also found
that GFAP is detectable at low levels in the CSF of control
mice, but is elevated in three different AxD models to degrees
corresponding to the amount of GFAP accumulation in brain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
The experiments described here were approved by the An-
imal Care and Use Committee for the Graduate School at
the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The GfapR236H/ + and
GfapR76H/ + lines of mice contain knock-in mutations at the
endogenous Gfap locus that are homologous to common
human AxD-associated mutations (R239H and R79H, respec-
tively) (Hagemann et al., 2006). The GFAPTg mice are a trans-
genic line (Tg73.7) that overexpresses wild-type human GFAP
(Messing et al., 1998). The Gfap-luc mice are a transgenic line
that expresses firefly luciferase under the control of a 12 kb
murine Gfap promoter (Zhu et al., 2004). Gfaptm1Mes mice
carry a null mutation at the Gfap locus (McCall et al., 1996),
and were used as negative controls in the validation of the
GFAP ELISA (see below). All mice were maintained in the
FVB/N background and were housed under a 14­10 light­
dark cycle with ad libitum access to food. Samples were col-
lected from mice at 8 weeks of age. Brains were either divided
sagittally into two equal halves, or dissected into individual
regions [olfactory bulb, frontal cortex (anterior to Bregma,
dorsal grey matter containing little or no white matter), hip-
pocampus, cerebellum and brain stem] along with cervical
spinal cord. Tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitro-
gen and stored at - 80C until further processing.
Quantification of Gfap promoter activity
Gfap-luc transgenic mice were used as indirect reporters of
Gfap promoter activity. Firefly luciferase activity was quanti-
fied using the Dual-Glo luciferase kit (Promega), according to
the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, tissues were homoge-
nized in reporter lysis buffer (125 mg tissue per ml buffer),
centrifuged at 17500 g for 20 min at 4C, and the super-
natant taken for analysis. An aliquot of this supernatant
(40 l for half brains, 20 l for smaller pieces) was diluted
1:1 in firefly luciferase reagent and allowed it to incubate
at room temperature (22­24 C) for 12 min. The signal in-
tensity was then determined with a GloRunner Microplate
Luminometer (Turner Biosystems). A separate aliquot was as-
sayed for total protein using a BCA Protein Assay kit with
BSA as a standard (Thermo Scientific). Values are expressed
in arbitrary luminescent units per mg protein.
Quantification of Gfap mRNA
Tissues were homogenized in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) ac-
cording to the manufacturer's directions. cDNA was synthe-
sized using Superscript III (Invitrogen) according to the man-
ufacturer's protocol. Specific transcripts were then quantified
by real-time PCR using Power SYBR Green Master Mix and an
Applied Biosystem 7500 Real-Time PCR system as described
previously (Hagemann et al., 2005). Primer sets were the fol-
lowing: Gfap (forward: 5 -CAACGTTAAGCTAGCCCTGGACAT-
3 , reverse: 5 -CTCACCATCCCGCATCTCCACAGT-3 ), 18S ri-
bosomal RNA (forward: 5 -CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTCT-3 ,
reverse: 5 -CGAACCTCCGACTTTCGTTCT-3 ) and TATA-box-
binding protein (forward 5 -GCACAGGAGCCAAGAGTGA-3 ,
reverse 5 -CCCACCATGTTCTGGATCTT-3 ). Gfap transcript lev-
els were normalized to both the 18S ribosomal and TATA-
box-binding protein RNAs. Both normalizations yielded simi-
lar results. Data shown were normalized to the 18S ribosomal
RNA.
Collection of CSF
CSF was collected from mice according to the method of
DeMattos et al. (2002). Mice were anaesthetized with avertin
(400­600 mg/kg intraperitoneally). A midline sagittal inci-
sion was made over the dorsal aspect of the hindbrain and
three muscle layers carefully peeled back to expose the cis-
terna magna. The membrane covering the cisterna magna

was pierced with a 30 gauge needle, and CSF was collected
immediately using a flexible plastic pipette. Approximately
10 l of CSF was collected per animal, and stored at - 80C
until further processing.
Quantification of GFAP protein
Brain samples were homogenized (w/v, 1:16) in 2% SDS,
50mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 5mM EDTA (pH 7.4), 1mM Pefa-
blocSC (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1× Complete Proteinase In-
hibitor (Roche) using a Geno/Grinder tissue homogenizer
(SPEX CertiPrep). After homogenization, samples were boiled
for 15 min. Samples were then diluted in PBS (Fisher, #BP399-
4) and protein concentration determined using a BCA Protein
Assay kit with BSA as a standard (Pierce). This same diluted
sample was then used for the GFAP ELISA as described below.
GFAP protein was quantified using a sandwich ELISA as
previously described (Petzold et al., 2004; Hagemann et al.,
2009), with minor modifications. Briefly, a microtitre plate
(Nunc MaxiSorp) was coated with a cocktail of monoclonal
antibodies (Covance, SMI-26R) diluted in PBS (Fisher). Plates
were blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk
powder in PBS before addition of samples or standards diluted
in PBS with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 1% (w/v) BSA (Sigma,
#A7030). Antibody incubation steps were performed in 5%
(w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk powder­PBS, and washing
steps were performed in PBS­Tween 20 (without BSA). Stan-
dard curves were generated using bovine GFAP (Fitzgerald
Industries International, # RDI-PRO62007) diluted in PBS­
1% BSA. Assay volumes consisted of 100 l per well when
analysing brain samples or 50 l per well when analysing CSF.
Samples were diluted with PBS­Tween 20­BSA as needed to
bring their GFAP values within the linear range of the stan-
dard curve.
In the case of CSF samples from controls, which typically
had low levels of GFAP, the dilutions required to bring the
reaction volume up to the minimum 100 l for duplicate
wells often meant that the values fell below the BLD (bi-
ological limit of detection) (see below). We therefore used
pooled samples for controls, replicated as four independent
sets derived from 3­4 animals per group, and diluted a mini-
mal amount (36 l CSF + 64 l ELISA buffer). Mice from the
AxD models had high-enough levels of GFAP to allow di-
lutions from individual samples, typically 1:16­1:120. After
washing, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Dako, # Z334) was
used to detect the GFAP followed by a peroxidase conju-
gated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Sigma, # A6154).
The peroxidase activity was detected with SuperSignal ELISA
Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Thermo Scientific)
and quantified with a GloRunner Microplate Luminometer
(Turner Biosystems). GFAP values for the brain samples were
expressed as per mg total protein and for the CSF samples as
ng/l.
Under these conditions the lower limit of detection (de-
fined as three S.D. above the mean of replicate blank samples)
was 11 ng/l, and the BLD (defined as the lower limit of detec-
tion plus three S.D. of a known low-concentration sample)
(Westgard, 2008) was 21 ng/l for a 50 l reaction volume. The
intra-assay COV (coefficient of variation), determined using
the bovine GFAP standard at 33 ng/l in ten sets of triplicate
wells, was 13%. The inter-assay COV, determined from the
pooled CSF samples taken from GFAPTg mice (with values
higher on the standard curve), divided into multiple iden-
tical aliquots to allow ten independent assays on different
days, was 11%. Samples from Gfap-null mice give readings
that are below the BLD in this assay (results not shown), thus
validating its specificity.
Statistical analysis
For the comparisons of Gfap promoter activity, mRNA and
protein shown in Figure 2, data were first log transformed
[Y = log(Y)] to equalize the S.D. (the Figure shows the orig-
inal untransformed data) and then analysed using a two-
way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni-corrected t-tests. All
other data analyses used a one-way ANOVA with post-
hoc Bonferroni-corrected t-tests between GfapR236H/ + and
Gfap+ / + . The error shown for the fold-changes between
GfapR236H/ + and Gfap+ / + mice in Figure 2 is the calculated
propagated error for each data point. The CSF analysis also
required log transformation of the data to equalize the S.D.,
and was then analysed using a one-way ANOVA with post-
hoc Bonferroni-corrected t-tests.
RESULTS
Gfap promoter activity, mRNA and protein vary
by brain regions in Gfap+ / + mice
We sought to test whether Gfap-luc transgenic reporter mice,
which express the firefly luciferase under the control of the
murine Gfap promoter, thus serving as an indirect monitor
of promoter activity, faithfully reflect the regional varia-
tion in GFAP expression that is known to exist in the rodent
CNS (central nervous system). In Gfap-luc transgenics that
are wild-type at the Gfap locus (Gfap+ / + ), luciferase activity
was highest in the spinal cord, intermediate in olfactory bulb,
hippocampus and brain stem, and lowest in cerebral cortex
and cerebellum (Figure 1A). For comparison, we measured
Gfap mRNA levels in these same regions, and found that
spinal cord and brain stem had the highest levels, and cere-
bellum and cerebral cortex the lowest (Figure 1B). Total GFAP
protein levels, as measured by ELISA, followed essentially the
same pattern as mRNA (Figure 1C). Hence, luciferase activity
from the reporter mice mirrored relative mRNA and protein
levels for all regions that were examined, with the exception
of brain stem.

Regional Gfap gene activity in GfapR236H/ + mice
Mice carrying point mutations at the Gfap locus mimicking
those found in AxD patients have elevated levels of Gfap
mRNA and protein (Hagemann et al., 2006; LaPash Daniels
et al., 2012), although not uniformly in all regions of the CNS.
In order to test whether these changes in GFAP expression are
mirrored by the Gfap-luc reporter, we crossed the reporter
with a knock-in of the R236H mutation (GfapR236H/ + ), and
examined all three measures of GFAP expression in various
CNS regions of 8-week-old mice (Figure 2).
Gfap promoter activity significantly increased in all six
regions of Gfap-luc;GfapR236H/ + mice compared with Gfap-
luc;Gfap+ / + littermates. The largest fold-increase of Gfap
promoter activity was in the olfactory bulb (7.6 +
- 1.2), and
the smallest in cerebellum (2.1 +
- 0.4), with intermediate
changes for the other regions. Quantification of Gfap mRNA
levels in the same mice revealed fold changes similar to those
found for promoter activity in olfactory bulb, hippocampus,
cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and more modest increases
in brain stem and spinal cord.
Figure 2 Levels of Gfap promoter activity, mRNA and protein in
GfapR236H/ + mice compared with Gfap+ / + mice
A comparison of the fold changes seen in Gfap promoter activity, mRNA and
protein shows that all three are reflective of the other except in spinal cord
and brain stem (two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni t-test; ns, not
significant; **P < 0.01;*** P < 0.001 compared with wild-type). Presented as
an average fold-change +
- 1 S.D. on log 2 scale (n = 3­6 per genotype, males).
We then measured total GFAP protein levels in the same
brain regions from Gfap mutant compared with wild-type
mice. As previously described (Hagemann et al., 2006; LaPash
Daniels et al., 2012), both olfactory bulb and hippocampus
displayed substantially increased levels of GFAP (40-fold +
- 5
for olfactory bulb; 30 +
- 3 for hippocampus), but well be-
yond the fold changes observed for promoter activity and
mRNA. Cerebellar GFAP increased by a modest amount, com-
mensurate with the changes in promoter activity and mRNA.
Interestingly, the two regions of the CNS with the highest
basal levels of GFAP protein in wild-type mice, brain stem
and spinal cord (see Figure 1C), displayed marked discrep-
ancies between promoter activity/mRNA levels and protein
levels when evaluated in the GfapR236H/ + mutants. Although
promoter activity increased about 5-fold in both the brain
stem and the spinal cord, mRNA levels increased by a lesser
amount, and protein remained unchanged in brain stem and
actually decreased in spinal cord. Hence, when examined in
the context of the injury response associated with expression
of mutant GFAP, the precise relationships between promoter
activity, transcription and protein accumulation is complex
and varies considerably between different regions of the CNS.
Induction of Gfap promoter and increase in
mRNA is not affected by gender
Previous studies have implicated oestrogens in the hormonal
regulation of GFAP expression (Laping et al., 1994; Stone
et al., 1998; Levin-Allerhand et al., 2001; McAsey et al., 2006;
Cho et al., 2010). We therefore tested whether the changes
in Gfap promoter activity and mRNA observed in the con-
text of the R236H point mutation were influenced by gen-
der. However, none of the regions examined showed any
differences between males and females [olfactory bulb illus-
trated in Figure 3, other regions (results not shown)].

While Gfap promoter activity and mRNA are elevated in GfapR236H/ + mice
compared with Gfap+ / + , the effect is similar in males and females in olfactory

Time course of induction of Gfap promoter
activity in Gfap+ / + and GfapR236H/ + mice
To determine when Gfap promoter activity becomes elevated
in Gfap mutant mice during development, we analysed lu-
ciferase activity in whole brains (including olfactory bulbs)
from Gfap-luc;GfapR236H/ + mice compared with Gfap-luc
littermate controls at various ages beginning at post-natal
day 1 (p1). Luciferase activity displayed about a 4-fold in-
crease in GfapR236H/ + mice as early as p14, and remained sig-
nificantly elevated through 8 weeks of age (Figure 4). Using
a different luciferase assay, we examined mice at 6 months
of age, and found that elevated promoter activity was still
evident (results not shown).
GFAP in CSF of Gfap mutant and GFAP
transgenic mice
In pilot studies of CSF from individual control mice using
standard dilutions required to reach minimal assay reaction
volumes (see the Materials and Methods section), one-third
of the samples yielded values that were below the BLD of the
assay. To permit an accurate determination of the values in
controls, we therefore created four separate sets of pooled
samples, each composed of CSF taken from 3­4 Gfap + / +
mice. In this manner, the volume of CSF was sufficient for

Gfap promoter activity is significantly elevated in GfapR236H/ + mice over
Gfap+ / + controls as early as postnatal day 14 (p14) and remains elevated
through 8 weeks of age (p56). (One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni

use with minimal dilution in the GFAP ELISA, thus increasing
the sensitivity for detection. We then measured GFAP in CSF
from individual mice of three AxD models that have previ-
ously been found to have varying levels of GFAP accumu-
lation in brain parenchyma: the GfapR236H/ + mice described
above, the GfapR76H/ + knock-in model (homologous to the
human R79H mutation and intermediate in levels of GFAP
between control and GfapR236H/ + mice), and the transgenic
that overexpresses human wild-type GFAP to very high lev-
els (Hagemann et al., 2006). We found that GFAP in the CSF
of Gfap+ / + mice was detectable in all four pooled samples
(354 +
- 217 ng/l, means +
- S.D.), whereas GFAP in the CSF of all
three AxD models was significantly elevated compared with
controls, and in the same rank order as expected from brain
(1264 +
- 596 for GfapR76H/ + ; 2637 +
- 1001 for GfapR236H/ + ;
46676 +
- 40533 for GFAPTg mice; n = 9­14 in each group).
In addition, the differences in CSF levels between the AxD
model groups were statistically significant in all pair-wise
comparisons (Figure 5).
Brain levels of GFAP were then determined in each individ-
ual from which the CSF samples were taken in the three AxD
models. Although the between-group comparisons showed
distinct differences, within each group the correlation be-
tween CSF and brain levels for individuals was not signifi-
cant (GfapR76H/ + , r2 = 0.27; GfapR236H/ + , r2 = 0.38; GFAPTg,
r2 = 0.07; analysed by the Spearman non-parametric correla-
tion) (Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.asnneuro.org/
an/005/an005e109add.htm).
DISCUSSION
While mutations in GFAP are clearly the initiating event in
AxD, ultimately the total amount of GFAP rises with sec-
ondary consequences for a multitude of astrocyte functions.

Figure 5 GFAP protein in CSF of mouse models of AxD
GFAP is elevated in CSF of all three mouse models of AxD (GfapR76H/ + ,
GfapR236H/ + and GFAPTg) compared with Gfap+ / + controls. Presented as
means +
- 1 S.D. on a split linear scale (n = 9­14, males). (One-way ANOVA

What accounts for this increase is not clearly understood, al-
though changes in the rates of both degradation and synthe-
sis have been proposed (Messing and Brenner, 2013). Whether
documented elevations in GFAP mRNA can be accounted for
by increased activity of the GFAP promoter has not previ-
ously been addressed, and whether the putative changes in
promoter activity and increases in protein can be exploited
for drug discovery and clinical studies is also not known. Here
we demonstrate, using several mouse models of AxD, that the
activity of the murine Gfap promoter is indeed increased as
an early and sustained response following the expression of
mutant GFAP in vivo. Furthermore, we find that the levels
of GFAP in CSF increase, roughly in parallel with the degree of
increase present in brain. These results provide a foundation
on which to build future studies seeking to interfere with the
toxic increase in GFAP as a therapeutic goal (Messing et al.,
2010).
Activation of the GFAP promoter with resulting increase in
synthesis is considered a fundamental property of reactive as-
trocytes. Although the precise mechanisms mediating this in-
crease are still topics of active investigation, numerous stud-
ies suggest that at least some of the regulatory elements for
the reactive response lie within a 2.2 kb fragment of the 5 re-
gion of the gene. Previous studies from our laboratory utilized
this 2.2 kb human GFAP promoter construct to create dual
luciferase reporter mice for monitoring of GFAP promoter
activity, and in crosses of these luciferase reporters with the
GfapR236H/ + mutants we found only a modest increase in lu-
ciferase activity, which disappeared by 8 weeks of age (Cho
et al., 2009). In contrast, the Gfap-luc mouse utilized in the
present study, which differs from our dual luciferase mouse
in several respects, reports a much larger and sustained in-
crease in promoter activity. In addition, the fold-increase in
luciferase activity more closely resembles the fold change
in mRNA levels, suggesting as well that the predominant
regulation of GFAP expression occurs at the level of tran-
scriptional activation.
The degree to which elevated levels of GFAP protein per se
provide the initial stimulus leading to promoter activation is
not yet clear. Future studies will examine the response of the
Gfap-luc reporter in transgenic lines that overexpress wild-
type rather than mutant GFAP, although it will be important
to closely match the levels of GFAP protein between lines.
It is possible that mutant GFAP acts in essentially the same
manner as wild-type, but more efficiently and at lower levels
of overexpression.
That expression of GFAP varies considerably in different
regions of the CNS and in different populations of astro-
cytes is well known. For instance, both mouse and human
data reveal the highest levels of both mRNA and protein
in spinal cord and brain stem, followed in descending or-
der by hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cerebellum and cerebral
cortex (Palfreyman et al., 1979; Chen et al., 1993; Martin and
O'Callaghan, 1995; Lein et al., 2007). In contrast, one study of
rats found cerebellum to be higher than hippocampus (Martin
and O'Callaghan, 1995). The reasons for these differences are
not clear, but could reflect variations in either the number
or composition of astrocyte sub-types among regions. Re-
cent studies of human astrocytes differentiated in vitro from
embryonic stem cells reveal that those induced to a `cau-
dalized' phenotype through exposure to retinoic acid express
higher levels of GFAP than those following the default rostral
pathway of differentiation (Krencik et al., 2011). Our studies
support the idea that regulation of GFAP levels occurs pri-
marily at the level of transcription, as originally proposed by
Brenner (1994), with a notable exception being spinal cord of
the GFAP mutants. It is interesting that while the type I form
of AxD is characterized by predominance of forebrain lesions,
the type II form shifts to a hindbrain distribution, with many
adult-onset patients experiencing atrophy of the medulla and
cervical spinal cord (Prust et al., 2011; Messing et al., 2012).
Why GFAP should appear in the CSF is not at all clear.
Studies in a wide variety of human disorders document el-
evations of GFAP that are typically attributed to cell death,
although most of these studies also find detectable levels
even in healthy controls (Liem and Messing, 2009). One pos-
sibility is that GFAP, despite being a cytoskeletal protein,
is normally secreted from astrocytes, as has been found to
occur for vimentin from macrophages (Mor-Vaknin et al.,
2003). Studies of the astrocyte secretome have largely uti-
lized cell cultures and are complicated by the problem of
correcting for contamination by cytoplasmic contents ­ most
reports finding that vimentin and not GFAP is secreted (Del-
court et al., 2005; Keene et al., 2009; Greco et al., 2010).
Dowell et al. (2009) did find GFAP in the supernatant from
cultured mouse astrocytes, but considered it a contami-
nant. Moore et al. (2009), in a study using rat astrocyte
cultures, found neither vimentin nor GFAP. Whether the
GFAP mutations and brain overexpression that have been
found in AxD lead to astrocyte death, with consequent re-
lease of cytoplasmic contents into the extracellular space and

GFAP expression in Alexander disease models
eventually CSF, is also not known. Evidence for an increase
in cell death following expression of mutant GFAP has been
obtained from cell culture models (Mignot et al., 2007; Cho
and Messing, 2009), but no similar data have been obtained
from the in vivo models of disease (Hagemann et al., 2006;
Tanaka et al., 2007). The amount of GFAP present in the CSF
of GFAPTg mice is sufficiently high as to be detectable by mass
spectrometry, thus opening new possibilities for methods
of quantification and characterization (Cunningham et al.,
2013).
A major problem facing therapeutic research is the iden-
tification of suitable biomarkers that reflect key pathways of
disease and could be responsive to drugs or other types of
treatment. The response of the Gfap-luc reporter mouse
clearly demonstrates transactivation of the Gfap promoter,
perhaps as a final common pathway in the putative posi-
tive feedback loops that lead to toxic accumulation of GFAP
(Messing et al., 2012). Activation of the Gfap promoter may
also represent a step in pathogenesis that is amenable to
drug discovery or screening efforts (Cho et al., 2010; Messing
et al., 2010). In addition, the elevation of GFAP that occurs
in CSF may prove useful as a biomarker of disease severity
or progression in clinical studies of AxD. Indeed, Kyllerman
et al. (2005) studied three patients, each of whom exhibited
markedly elevated levels in their CSF compared with con-
trols. A study of CSF levels of GFAP in a larger cohort of
AxD patients is currently underway, along with an evalua-
tion of blood levels. The validation of biomarkers that occur
both in human patients as well as animal models will greatly
facilitate the evaluation of candidate therapies in the future.
