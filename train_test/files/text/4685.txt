Responding Appropriately to Sensitive Research Issues
Research staff face considerable challenges ensuring that
prospective participants understand what research participa-
tion will entail. Ethical­legal frameworks stipulate a long
menu of concepts that must be understood, for example, the
guidelines from Council for International Organizations of
Medical Sciences (CIOMS, 2002) sets out over 30 key
elements. Prior research has shown many deficiencies in
participants' understanding across many research settings
(Mandava, Pace, Campbell, Emanuel, & Grady, 2012), and
some commentators have argued that consent is "widely
valued" yet "imperfectly realized" (Grady, 2004, p. 467). It
has been recommended that consent efforts be strengthened
with adult education and communication principles (Meade,
1999; Penn & Evans, 2009). It also has been recommended
that consent interactions be observed and analyzed using
specialized observational frameworks (Gross-Cohn, Jia,
Chapman Smith, Erwin, & Larson, 2011; Tomamichel, Sessa,
Herzig, de Jong, Pagani, & Cavalli, 1995). Commentators
have asserted that critical consent outcomes, such as under-
standing, are best understood as a function of the interaction
between individual characteristics (e.g., educational attain-
ment, literacy, familiarity with research) and the consent
context, including the skills and strategies of communicators
(cf. Fisher, 2010). Faden and Beauchamp drily observed in
1986 that "disclosure is the lawyer's entre to the world of
informed consent, but it is a back-fence gate to that world,
and a narrow one at that" (p. 307) arguing instead for the
centrality of "effective communication" (p. 307).

Abstract
There has not been enough study of the processes by which site staff help participating community members and potential
participants to understand complicated concepts for HIV vaccine trials. This article describes strategies reported in six
focus group discussions with Community Advisory Board members, educators, and consent counselors at an active HIV
vaccine trial site in South Africa. Thematic analysis identified a considerable range of strategies, and findings suggest that
such staff do not only try to promote understanding of critical information but also try to build trust in communicated
information, to respect cultural differences, and to promote voluntariness. Findings also suggest occasional tensions
between these implicit goals. Actual engagement and consent encounters at HIV vaccine trial sites should be observed,
recorded, and analyzed; and the relationship between practices and valued outcomes should be assessed. These efforts
may help to make consent-related encounters as "potent" as possible given finite resources.

Consent challenges abound in trials of HIV vaccines
where fairly complex concepts should be understood (Joint
United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS/ World
Health Organization [UNAIDS/WHO], 2012; Lindegger,
Milford, Slack, Quayle, Xaba, & Vardas, 2006; South
African Medical Research Council [SA MRC], 2003).
There have been many efforts to enhance understanding in
such trials by developing sound written consent materials
(Koblin et al., 2010; Lally, Goldsworthy, Sarr, Kahn,
Brown, Peralta, & Zimet, 2014). However, commentators
in this field also increasingly argue for attention to the pro-
cesses by which these complex concepts are communicated
(Koblin et al., 2010; Ndebele, Wassenaar, Masiye, &
Munula-Nkandu, 2014; Rautenbach, Lindegger, Slack,
Wallace, & Newman, 2015; Watermeyer & Penn, 2008).
Yet, there is very little published work evaluating commu-
nication during consent interactions in HIV vaccine trials
(Watermeyer & Penn, 2008). This article explores the strat-
egies and practices being used by key vaccine stakeholders
at an HIV vaccine trial site in South Africa to communicate
complex research concepts to prospective participants in
consent and engagement encounters in HIV vaccine trials,
and the attendant challenges.
Aims and Method
Our overall study aimed to explore--with critical site con-
stituencies--the representations of key research concepts in
HIV vaccine trials, and strategies used to communicate con-
cepts for such trials, and to consider the implications for
consent processes. The overall study was approved by all
Research Ethics Committees affiliated to the research team,
the site, and the funders [University of KwaZulu-Natal
Humanities and Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee
(HSS 0554/012)]. Results related to "competing" versions
of key concepts were presented in an earlier article
(Rautenbach et al., 2015). The present article describes
results regarding the strategies reportedly being used to
communicate complex research concepts to prospective
participants in consent and engagement encounters in HIV
vaccine trials and complexities.
Ongoing outreach to the site underscored that there
were various encounters in which research concepts are
communicated. First, there were sessions in the commu-
nity where Community Advisory Board (CAB) members
and educators interact with participating community
members about the site and research more generally.
Second, there were group-discussion sessions at the site
where educators interact with community members inter-
ested in research. Third, there were group-based consent-
discussion groups, and individual sessions, at the site
where consent counselors interact with potential partici-
pants about enrollment into specific trials. Representatives
from these three site-related constituencies (namely, CAB
members, educators, and consent counselors) took part in
focus group discussions (FGDs) because all were well
placed to shed light on how information is communicated
about HIV vaccine trials. Specifically, we conducted two
FGDs with 10 CAB members each (i.e., 20 CAB-enrollees)
late in 2013. Then we conducted one FGD with eight edu-
cators also late in 2013 (i.e., eight educator-enrollees).
Subsequently, we conducted three FGDs with consent
counselors of seven, six, and eight members, respectively
(comprising 10 counselor-enrollees because several con-
sent counselors participated in more than one FGD).
Consent counselor FGDs were conducted in early 2014,
late 2015, and early 2016. Participation in any FGD
depended on availability and interest, and we did not pre-
clude any interested person from participation--given that
our objective was in-depth exploration through an itera-
tive process characteristic of qualitative research, rather
than to achieve generalizability.
During FGDs, representatives from each of the three
constituencies were asked to discuss key concepts, how key
concepts are explained (including the use of analogies), and
challenges or difficulties they experienced. Semistructured
schedules with probes guided the FGDs (cf. Kvale, 1996).
Also, facilitators and FGD-participants role-played the
explanation of concepts to "mock" participating commu-
nity members or "mock" potential participants and, subse-
quently, FGD-participants were invited to reflect on these
role-plays to stimulate discussion about the concepts, how
they are communicated, and challenges (cf. Rautenbach
et al., 2015). All FGDs explored similar domains, but ques-
tions and prompts were tailored to the activities and roles of
different trial constituencies.
FGDs were conducted between August 2013 and
February 2016, as set out above. The data set consisted of
six transcribed FGDs. Text was coded for practices using a
deductive and inductive approach to thematic analysis,
where some codes emerged from the literature and other
codes emerged from engagement with the transcripts
(cf. Braun & Clarke, 2006; Sandelowski, 2000). Practices
were collated according to the interface being reported on,
that is, CAB-participating community members, educator-
interested community members, and consent counselor-
potential participants and were finally clustered according
to critical goals being pursued, such as comprehension. A
sample of interviews was coded by an independent coder.
Coding differences were resolved by "reconciliation discus-
sions" (Boyatzis, 1998, p. 152). Written informed consent
was obtained for participation in FGDs. Site leadership
gave permission for site entry, and visits with various site
constituencies were undertaken to plan the research in 2013.
Three interactive feedback sessions were conducted in mid-
2014, late 2014, and late 2015 to obtain feedback on the
accuracy of the preliminary results (using anonymized
data), to stimulate discussion about the preliminary
324 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 11(4)
findings, to discuss the practical utility of the emerging
results, and to plan avenues for future inquiry.
Results
CAB members, educators and consent counselors all
described various practices to communicate key concepts in
a way that enhanced understanding. However, in many
instances, they appeared to be striving to reach other impor-
tant goals, such as building trust in communicated informa-
tion, respecting the culture of persons with whom they were
interacting, and preserving the free choice of potential par-
ticipants. Notably, in a few select instances, these goals
appeared to be in tension. The results are organized into
four sections representing overarching goals, and within
each section, various strategies to achieve these goals are
described.
Enhancing Comprehension
CAB members, educators, and consent counselors all
reported that they "share"/"give" information ("inform")
or "educate" potential participants and participating com-
munity members about key issues, such as HIV as a prob-
lem, the need for multiple HIV-prevention methods, the
need for research, the nature of research, HIV vaccine tri-
als, aims, procedures, risks, benefits, right to withdraw,
and other concepts. This "informing" was explicitly linked
to the goal of enhancing understanding, but more implic-
itly, they also seemed to view themselves as providing a
kind of information service--to build knowledge and
skills about HIV prevention. This information (the "what")
was reportedly delivered using various practices (the
"how") outlined below.
Representatives from most constituencies reportedly
made efforts to "inform" without using unfamiliar or overly
technical terms. Also, CAB members, educators, and con-
sent counselors all discussed using analogies to explain dif-
ficult research-related concepts. This included, for example,
referring to "soldiers" to help explain the role of antibodies
("Antibodies, I can make an example of the soldiers. Like,
the army . . . the army is there to attack, the intruder" [FGD
3, Educators]). Various analogies were reportedly available
to help explain different risks associated with being vacci-
nated with an experimental HIV vaccine in a clinical trial.
For example, to help communicate the potential risk of
increased susceptibility to HIV if vaccinated, the analogy of
a "magnet" could help explain how an experimental vac-
cine might make people more susceptible to HIV infection.
Participants also acknowledged the potential for confusion
to arise from the use of some analogies.1
Furthermore, CAB members, educators, and consent
counselors all reported using familiar examples--from
everyday life--to explain research and its contribution to
health (e.g., a popular local over-the-counter analgesic like
Grandpa headache powder was alluded to as a product of
research). They also frequently invoked familiar childhood
vaccines (such as polio vaccine or tuberculosis (TB) vac-
cine) to explain the process and benefits of vaccines--how
vaccines have controlled deadly diseases, and how their
safety and efficacy must be explored with human volun-
teers ("you have to start with what they know, you have to
start with the flu vaccine" [FGD 4, Consent Counselors]).
Here, they were trying to build understanding of less famil-
iar material by drawing on experiences with common med-
ical interventions:
. . . if you make mention of the vaccines about polio, measles
and other diseases, it clears up their mind, and it gets into
their understanding--"okay there is a vaccine for other
diseases" so, there are, you make comparison, of the HIV
vaccine to the vaccines that are available in the local clinics.
(FGD 3, Educators)
In addition, site staff reported using various aids, for
example, educators reported using PowerPoint presenta-
tions or pamphlets to ensure that participating community
members have a visual representation of what is being ver-
bally discussed. Consent counselors reported bringing
instruments to the consent discussion (such as tubes for
blood draws) to help potential participants better under-
stand procedures they would undergo:
So, another thing that's, that helps a lot, if you are going to talk
about blood samples, visual aids help a lot. If you gonna talk
about blood samples you cannot say "we gonna take this much
blood," in their mind they cannot make up, how much blood
you gonna take. You need to have those tubes in front of you
. . . (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)
Also, educators and consent counselors reported using
various techniques to increase discussion with, participa-
tion by, and contributions from, potential participants.
Educators reported modeling the asking of challenging
questions, and using group formats where question-ask-
ing would be modeled by other attendees. Consent coun-
selors described building in "pauses" ("stops"), asking
for questions, directly asking questions of attendees,
working through consent forms, and using group formats
for consent discussions where making inputs was mod-
eled for other group attendees. Here, trying to get persons
to interact with site staff seemed to be viewed as a good
outcome in and of itself (possibly because it respected
their status as adult learners, with an experiential base)
but was also viewed as an important way to improve
understanding by identifying knowledge needs and
knowledge deficiencies:
Slack et al. 325
. . . we make sure that we do, when we are doing a consent
discussion group, we have more people, maybe ten people, so
that there can be more discussion and it will be the first time that
they will be hearing about the study, so we expect that they will
have many questions, so that they can be able to understand what
will be going on in the study . . . (FGD 6, Consent Counselors)
Consent counselors observed that participants some-
times report that they understand even when they do not
understand, linking this to potential power differentials
(e.g., between participants and senior study staff like study
clinicians), or to participants'desires to service the relation-
ship with the counselor:
. . . like they will stare at you, and then when you ask questions
they'll say, "no I'm ok." You know what I mean, so that's why
you need to prepare at first that, "we will interact, I will give
you information, (there'll be) questions. If you don't ask me, I
will ask you." (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)
In response, consent counselors described not necessar-
ily accepting reports that participants understood, but rather
attempting to check participants' understanding by asking
them to explain research concepts in their own words, iden-
tifying gaps in understanding, and revisiting informational
aspects, as highlighted in the quote below:
. . . that is why from the very onset, when that participant
comes to the site, when you are giving that information, you
pause, and ask the participant "do you understand? Can you
explain to me what exactly did you (take in), from what I was
saying to you?" From there it's . . . pick up that ok, now the
participant absorbed this information, this one didn't really go
in. Then we know where to do the touch-ups . . . (FGD 5,
Consent Counselors)
Furthermore, consent counselors reported making
efforts to communicate with potential participants using
their preferred language--to help get messages across
thereby improving understanding. However, it seemed to
also be used to achieve other more implicit goals such as
making participants feel more comfortable (at ease) during
the interaction, to equip them for the consent encounter and
to respect them as choosing agents by showing them that
their preferences would be respected. Sometimes the goal
of improving understanding and the goal of respecting
choices appeared to conflict--such as when counselors
reported overriding preferences for English when it was
clear that this would undermine comprehension, as seen in
the following quote:
. . . our participant would like to choose English . . . maybe they
are fearing to be judged, by us . . . you'll find "no, sisi [sister],
you don't understand English." And, they said "no I
understand" I said "ok fine, explain to me, what `blood test'
mean." You know what I mean. (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)
Consent counselors also reported switching between
languages to accommodate participants' language prefer-
ences. ("So you switch yourself you go for the language
that is easy for him, you can go for the deeper language,
you just accommodate" [FGD 4, counselors].) Educators
and consent counselors reported doing on-the-spot trans-
lation of terminology into potential participants' home
language--with some resulting challenges. As one coun-
selor remarked, "Most of the scientific terms do not exist
at all, in the indigenous language, so we have to make a
sentence in order to define that word" (FGD 4, Consent
Counselor). Consent counselors reportedly viewed the
informed-consent process as an ongoing process with
multiple opportunities to interact with participants and to
reinforce information:
. . . so every visit they come, we review the informed consent.
We know mos it's a lot of information that we give them in the
informed consent form--maybe they will forget . . . If they
having some questions in that--because they have got their
copies, to take home and to read it at home. Then, if they've got
any questions, come back they answer/they ask the questions.
And then each day . . . has got its own procedures. That is when
you have to revisit the informed consent that we did at first . . .
(FGD 5, Consent Counselors)
Consent counselors experienced some tension between
sound understanding and the sheer volume of information
that needed to be disclosed in the available time frame, and
tensions between sound understanding, and the demands of
working through several consent forms, for example, one
for trial enrollment and another for stored samples. As one
reported,
So for us we find it is very strenuous but there are these
clauses that limit us that come from the sponsor that part of
these visits these are the consents. Cos we feel it's too much,
really, doing different consents in one time . . . (FGD 4,
Consent Counselors)
Educators and consent counselors also described identi-
fying key characteristics of the persons they were educating
and making efforts to accommodate these:
. . . we need to understand this person or this group. You
understand. Their level of understanding, a way of observing
. . . these are the things that you always consider, you know
prior you know starting a consent . . . (FGD 4, Consent
Counselors)
Educators and consent counselors recognized that there
may be preexisting ideas in the minds of potential partici-
pants or circulating in the community that might undermine
understanding of important information, and that explana-
tions have to be tailored to such misunderstandings:
326 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 11(4)
. . . we start explaining to the participant that, what exactly the
Centre is doing. That we are a research centre unit, we are not
taking blood as for donation . . . we are not giving people food
parcels because some of them they come with that mind-set that
they are going to get food parcels, so we need to explain to
participants, some of them they will come and said, "I'm
coming for VCT" [Voluntary Counseling and Testing] . . .
(FGD 5, Consent Counselors)
Building Trust
CAB members, educators, and counselors all reported
encountering information about key research concepts
among community members and potential participants that
is wrong or inaccurate. In response, they reported that they
elaborate, explain, educate, invite for education, use spe-
cific terms, give the "right" or "correct" information, as
well as track common suspicions. However, in addition to
merely giving information that is "correct" (or simplified,
or translated, or adequately discussed--as discussed under
the "Enhancing Comprehension" section), they reported
various strategies likely to build trust in the information that
is given, that is, likely to strengthen the credibility of infor-
mation that is given
For example, it was reported that ex-participants play a
role in informing others about the research. This served not
only to enhance understanding, by being able to detail the
impacts of participation, but also, more implicitly, to build
trust in the account because it derived from a credible
source:
And when I reach out to the community I explain to them that
I am also, one of those participants on the site, so I practice
what I actually preach to them . . . I say "no, I've been I've
gone through this my own self, so, I practice what I actually
preach . . ." (FGD 2, CAB members)
Furthermore, it was reported that educators and consent
counselors employed at the site were drawn from similar
cultural, racial, and linguistic backgrounds. This served not
only to improve comprehension of transmitted information
by, for example, using appropriate language but also to
strengthen confidence that such information is trustworthy.
Representatives from most constituencies described var-
ious practices they viewed as critical in building interper-
sonal trust between themselves and participating community
members or potential participants with whom they interact.
CAB members and consent counselors reported the impor-
tance of being honest or transparent, and being consistent or
reliable:
you can never try to motivate behavior in the communities, if
you talk this, and tomorrow you do the other . . . And it will
really lose trust in you, because you telling us this, and you are
not doing it yourself. (FGD 2 CAB)
In addition, consent counselors acknowledged the
importance of respecting confidences, and generally treat-
ing potential participants right (such as greeting, welcom-
ing, offering refreshments, and showing interest in their
nonresearch lives). These latter aspects underscore the
intrinsic importance of treating potential participants with
respect:
. . . then I'm like "have a seat, and relax," make that
participant feel at home, and to try to communicate with the
participant, try to feel what the participant is feeling, try to
put yourself in their shoes. Then that's what makes the
participant--the other thing is, speaking the same language
with the participant . . . it makes him or her comfortable . . .
(FGD 5, Consent Counselors)
Also, educators and consent counselors noted the impor-
tance of the site providing services to participating commu-
nity members who are not enrolled in any research (e.g.,
health screening, counseling) and also to enrolled partici-
pants (e.g., ancillary care). Serving the community and
potential participants, and describing such services when
educating about trials, communicated that the site (and its
staff) is not motivated merely by self-interest but can be
trusted to further the nonresearch interests of the constitu-
encies with whom it interacts.Serving acted as a balance to
taking (time, goodwill) from such persons--it was a form
of giving back, and an observable demonstration of sensi-
tivity to their nonresearch lives:
And then you ask them about social impacts, because there are
so many things that are happening in our communities . . . So
that makes a person feel very, very comfortable, and see that
you care for them. So you don't just give them vaccine and just
sit down and, you don't follow up on whatever happens in their
lives. [And later] then you'll see that that participant has hope
that it's not about the study, that's it, then you deal with the
other issues that they have. (FGD 5, Consent Counselors)
In addition, CAB members, educators, and counselors
all reported that they describe the site as a partner in the
struggle against HIV--a struggle shared with community
members. Here, the site was positioned as an ally doing its
part against the epidemic, not only implying that a com-
mensurate response from the participating community
would be valued but also increasing trust in the site's broad
motivation--HIV prevention. Also, as discussed earlier,
CAB members, educators, and consent counselors fre-
quently invoked proven childhood vaccines such as polio
vaccine--which not only served to enhance understanding
of the pathway for HIV vaccine research but also might
serve to build trust in medical research as a whole, by citing
significant contributions that research has made to improve
the everyday lives, and health, of the most vulnerable soci-
etal members, namely, children.
Slack et al. 327
Respecting Culture
Consent counselors reported recognizing that potential
participants are drawn from cultures where norms govern-
ing how information can be discussed may differ from
norms governing the research enterprise. There were
instances where counselor efforts to improve understand-
ing of research concepts appeared to conflict with demon-
strating respect for participants' culture. In such instances,
consent counselors reported seeking permission to break
cultural boundaries--whereby they signaled to prospective
participants that culturally sensitive material was immi-
nent, justified the importance of the material in relation to
its sensitivity, and sought implicit permission to proceed.
In the quote below, the research procedure of rectal sam-
pling is being discussed:
. . . in our African people like if you say, to talk about, rectal
sampling when you have to explain to them, it seems as if you
being rude . . . so when you have to talk about anus and vaginas,
and now when you have to explain it in Xhosa, it's becoming a
big word, and her/in her ears. So you try to be like, even when
you talk to her and say, "This is going to be sensitive" . . .
because they start to be shocked when you try to explain these
words to them. (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)
Preserving Free Choice
Consent counselors experienced some tensions when pro-
moting understanding of key concepts such as payment for
participation. They recognized that payment often acts as
the initial motivator, so efforts are needed to broaden moti-
vation by informing potential participants about beneficial
study procedures, for example, health screens, as well as the
overall purpose of HIV vaccine research:
. . . we had a participant on (protocol name) . . . She said "you
know what when I came in here, my intention was to get
money, honestly, you understand. But now as the time goes by
where I get educated by counselors, I start changing that
attitude." That's the process of our most participants they
follow . . . (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)
They experienced some conflict between, on one hand,
their need for potential participants to understand study-
related payments (and study-related benefits), and, on the
other hand, their need for participants to concentrate on the
right things when deciding about research enrollment:
So, you have to explain clear, about that, not to put money
first. Because if you put money first the participant will only
come because they will get money, they will not concentrate or
understand what's gonna, what is, going on . . . (FGD 5,
Consent Counselors)
Consent counselors also reported emphasizing the
concept of voluntariness in their interactions with potential
participants, so that the right to refuse or withdraw is under-
stood, even while recognizing that participants may fail to
withdraw from studies (despite understanding their right to
withdraw) because of complexities linked, paradoxically, to
the high-quality relationship described under the "Building
Trust" section:
We always tell them, at the first, they have a right to withdraw
at any time they want, this is their voluntary, but you will find
out now, they are not doing their best, because they want to
impress us, because we have built that kind of a relationship
where we know them, on their first-name basis, now they want
to impress us . . . (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)
Lastly, consent counselors (and, in fact, also educators
and CAB members) reported appealing to altruism when
encouraging support for trials, and even participation in tri-
als. They described emphasizing that participation contrib-
utes positively to society as a whole, and that selfless acts
are required in the fight against the HIV epidemic. They did
not explicitly report concerns about the impact of such
appeals on voluntary choices.
. . . because we all know that HIV is killing all of us. And, I
believe that as we are explaining the importance of using this
(product) they will be, at some point or in some years to come,
they will be happy and knowing that they were part of that
clinical trials, that came up along with the product, that can
prevent the HIV infections . . . at the end of the day it's gonna
benefit many people, generations and generations of people to
come . . . (FGD 4, Consent Counselors)
Discussion
Representatives from various constituencies in our study
reported a range of strategies to promote understanding of
key research concepts. However, they also appeared com-
mitted to building trust, showing cultural respect, and pro-
moting voluntary consent for participation. In most
instances, there was harmony among these goals, yet, in
some instances, there was some tension between them. In
this section, these goals are discussed in relation to relevant
literature.
Promoting Comprehension
First, many of the practices reported to communicate trial
information resonate with recommendations to inform edu-
cational and consent encounters with principles of adult
education and principles of communication (Meade, 1999;
Woodsong & Abdool Karim, 2005). For example, everyday
examples and analogies were reportedly used--represent-
ing efforts to help people understand new ideas by relating
these to the rich reservoir of information and experience
they already possess as adult learners (Spezzini, 2010).
The use of more than one language (code switching) was
328 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 11(4)
described--recommended in adult education to not only
present the subject matter clearly but also create a warmer,
less alienating atmosphere for learning (Omidire, 2014).
Efforts to increase interaction were reportedly used--repre-
senting efforts to tap into accumulated skills and awareness
(Knowles, 1980). Critically for consent, "active participa-
tion" (where questions are asked, and concerns elicited)
helps ensure participants "receive information that is per-
sonally material"--allowing them to act on personal values
and desires (Faden & Beauchamp, 1986, p. 307)--ideally
leading to better quality decision making.
Second, many of the reported strategies are consistent
with ethical-guideline recommendations to be process-
focused--namely, that research teams should strive to
communicate key concepts, to promote the expression of
participants'concerns and questions, to establish an optimal
emotional context to explore information, to be sensitive to
the interpersonal interaction, to be aware of social desirabil-
ity, and to be culturally sensitive (UNAIDS/WHO, 2012;
Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS
[UNAIDS]2011; SA MRC, 2003).
Third, many of the reported practices are in accordance
with empirical research underscoring the importance of dis-
cussion in enhancing comprehension of research. For
research generally, Nishimura and colleagues (2013) found,
in a systematic review of 54 consent interventions tested in
randomized controlled trials, that discussion-based inter-
ventions were among the most effective at promoting
understanding. Tamariz, Palacio, Robert, and Marcos
(2012) found, in a systematic review of consent interven-
tions for low-literacy participants, that more time in discus-
sion was the most effective intervention. For HIV vaccine
trials specifically, Coletti and colleagues (2003) found that
an enhanced consent process among a subset of participants
in a vaccine preparedness study was associated with sub-
stantial knowledge gains compared with a standard con-
sent--the enhanced process included discussion of materials
with educators, and additional discussion with trained staff
members. However, Koblin et al. (2010) found no apparent
advantage to a consent intervention (also comprising dis-
cussion) conceding this may have been due to the success of
the standard consent. Other consent explorations in HIV
vaccine trials point to success of educational sessions
(Fitzgerald, Marotte, Verdier, Johnson, & Pape, 2002;
Joseph, 2006). Notably, the communication strategies used
in these discussions (and implicated in the positive out-
comes) have not been analyzed or described in published
research. We are aware of only one study for HIV vaccine
trials--conducted by Watermeyer and Penn (2008)--that
described communication practices being used in two taped
consent discussions between counselors and potential par-
ticipants. They reported finding several positive counselor
practices, such as providing simple explanations at appro-
priate linguistic levels and creating personalized moments
(humor, laughter). They also reported finding several nega-
tive counselor practices, such as dominating the session,
allowing minimal participant contribution, and not making
efforts to verify information. Yet, they did not explore the
relationship of such practices to outcomes such as improved
comprehension. It has been argued that--even for research
as a whole--it is still not entirely clear what aspects of con-
sent discussions or "person to person" interactions promote
understanding (Flory & Emanuel, 2004, p. 1589).
Fourth, many of the strategies reported here underscore
the recommendation in the HIV-prevention literature that
informed-consent processes can be strengthened by prior
and ongoing community engagement (UNAIDS, 2011;
Woodsong & Abdool Karim, 2005). Strategies to communi-
cate key concepts were reportedly implemented by engage-
ment stakeholders (educators and CAB members) at earlier
education sessions in the community and at the site, as well
as by consent staff during consent discussions. This sug-
gests that engagement and consent staff should be helped to
develop and share accurate and consistent messaging for
their communications. Even where sites do not use this
"staggered" approach, they should be aware that potential
participants might have been exposed to some concepts
before they interact with consent staff in individual consent
sessions, and that community-level ("on the street") under-
standings may have an impact on individual-level apprais-
als (cf. Woodsong & Abdool Karim, 2005, p. 414).
Also, some forms of effective communication may well
be threatened by time and efficiency pressures. For example,
interactive encounters are arguably more time-consuming
and less "efficient" than conventional "lecture"-type inter-
actions but may be associated with better outcomes (e.g.,
better attention or better motivation to learn; Knight &
Wood, 2005). Continued frank discussion, during staff
training, about potential threats to effective communication
is important to ongoing efforts to strengthen key processes.
Finally, we found that several communication practices
perceived to be important by site staff involved in consent
encounters were not reflected in available observational
frameworks for consent, such as the Process and Quality of
Informed Consent instrument or P-QUIC (Gross-Cohn
et al., 2011), for example, practices to demonstrate aware-
ness of cultural differences. Available frameworks may
benefit from adaptation based on empirical work with con-
sent communicators.
Building Trust
Many of the practices reported here from both educational
and consent encounters to build trust in the information
being communicated (e.g., making use of trustworthy
sources) show that site staff face considerable suspicion
about medical research in general, about the site itself and
even about themselves (Rautenbach et al., 2015). This
Slack et al. 329
underscores the importance of the dual goals of building
"research competency" ("literacy") and of building trusting
relationships (cf. UNAIDS, 2011) and recognizes "mis-
trust" to be as important a barrier to involvement in trials as
"misinformation" (cf. Andrasik et al., 2014; Newman &
Rubincam, 2014; Newman et al., 2015). As noted by
MacQueen, Bhan, Frohlich, Holzer, Sugarman et al. (2015),
future research into engagement should evaluate the explicit
contribution of various practices to various outcomes--not
only increased trust but also increased understanding, cul-
tural sensitivity, and contributions to research, as well as
decreased controversy or conflict (MacQueen et al., 2015;
Newman et al., 2015; Rubincam, Lacombe-Duncan, &
Newman, 2016). This qualitative investigation cannot deter-
mine which practices actually have an impact on the desired
outcome of increased trust (nor any other desired outcome),
but can shed light on practices perceived by core stakehold-
ers to be significant, for incorporation into future explora-
tions. What this study does indicate is that a singular focus
on information disclosure may elide crucial elements of trust
building implicit in the education and consent process.
Respecting Culture
Several practices described by these constituents represent
efforts to show respect for the culture of potential partici-
pants, such as using appropriate linguistic terms and care-
fully broaching sensitive topics (cf. Bayer, 1994; Rubincam
et al., 2016). Interestingly, in instances where helping
potential participants to understand what might happen to
them in trials was expected to run counter to cultural norms
about "who" can say "what," consent counselors "prepared
the ground" for disclosure of sensitive information. This
practice suggests that consent counselors do not uncritically
accept cultural norms (cf. Bayer, 1994), such as those
restricting women from discussing sensitive topics with
men (e.g., sexual body parts). Instead, they acknowledge
these norms and justify sensitively overruling them in the
interests of participant understanding. Of course, it is not
clear from this study whether such practices are actually
effective in adjudicating between the goals of understand-
ing and cultural respect, but they merit further attention in
research and practice guidelines.
Promoting Voluntariness
Several practices described by these constituents (e.g.,
emphasizing voluntariness, discussing benefits) appear
more relevant to promoting voluntary research participa-
tion, rather than informed research participation although
voluntariness and benefits are obviously concepts to be
understood in their own right. There were concerns about
whether promoting understanding of benefits might come at
a price--where decision making is somehow undermined.
Mamotte and Wassenaar (2015) observed that voluntariness
has generally been conceptualized poorly. Leading models
assert that "offers" are not threats to voluntariness unless
research-related risks are undervalued, ignored, or disre-
garded (Appelbaum, Lidz, & Klitzman, 2009a). Site staff
may need reassurance that discussing payments or benefits
(that themselves should be modest and well justified) with
potential participants is not in and of itself ethically prob-
lematic unless risks are being overlooked. Some site staff
described strategies to cultivate nonfinancial motivations
for enrollment. These data suggest that site staff may value
opportunities to practice communicating research-related
risks skillfully to potential participants in such discussions.
A recent study found that participants in two HIV clinical
trials did not report payment as the main reason for partici-
pation, nor was payment associated with reduced voluntari-
ness (Mamotte & Wassenaar, 2016).
The practice of appealing to altruism was not explicitly
reported as a concern; however, its ethical acceptability will
be briefly discussed here as this approach seemed to be fre-
quently used. Appelbaum, Lidz, and Klitzman (2009a)
argued that appealing to values such as "altruistic impulses"
(p. 33) does not render a decision to enroll nonvoluntary,
and "altruism is generally regarded as the least problematic
motivation for participation" (Appelbaum, Lidz, &
Klitzman, 2009b, p. 13). However, it stands to reason that
appeals to altruism should not be at the expense of a thor-
ough discussion of research risks, or be used to preempt
individuals' stated concerns. Also, there are arguably many
ways to express altruism in the HIV epidemicapart from
trial enrollment, such as taking part in advocacy efforts for
HIV prevention (UNAIDS, 2011).
Limitations
We explored reported practices at one site, and therefore,
our results may not be generalizable across other HIV vac-
cine trial sites; however, it is possible that sites with similar
approaches, staffing arrangements, and context may have
similar experiences and may find aspects of this study
applicable. Also, by design, FGDs were homogeneous to
encourage openness and candor. Therefore, there was no
opportunity for CABs, educators, and consent counselors to
interact and compare across constituencies their practices
(or challenges they face), which may further illuminate
some of the issues described. Furthermore, FGDs were con-
ducted across a period of time, during which staffing duties,
personnel, and approaches may have shifted. Finally, as
alluded to earlier, study methods used here cannot verify the
actual practices being implemented. For example, it is pos-
sible that in practice, educators and consent counselors use
less interactive techniques than they reported--because of
social desirability pressures to report communication efforts
and the contextual pressure in practice to transmit many
330 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 11(4)
complex and legally required concepts in an efficient time
frame. Also, merely because a strategy was not raised in a
FGD does not necessarily mean it is not used. In addition,
this study cannot shed light on which practices are effective
in achieving desired goals. Last, we did not canvass the
views of actual trial participants on these issues--this is a
more challenging population to engage with given under-
standable concerns with additional research activities that
may influence participant behaviors and the course of a
trial. Our results do, however, reveal important challenges,
unofficial strategies, and insights from uniquely positioned
and understudied informants who play vital roles in directly
interfacing with potential participants in HIV vaccine trials;
and the results raise important issues for further research
and engagement efforts.
Conclusion
Overall, site staff involved in engagement and consent pro-
cesses--such as educators and consent counselors--were
not merely trying to promote understanding of HIV vaccine
trials but appeared committed to other valued goals, such as
building trust, respecting culture, and promoting voluntari-
ness. The range of strategies and practices reportedly used
to promote these goals was quite considerable. In several
instances, these goals appear to be in tension, such as
respecting language choice while promoting understanding,
promoting understanding of invasive procedures while
respecting culture, or promoting understanding of study
aspects like payment while preserving free choice. Also, for
the goal of enhanced understanding, the need to transmit
multiple, complex concepts in an "efficient" time frame
may threaten those communication practices that are not
necessarily "efficient."
Best Practices
Trial sites should continue to make the human-resource
commitments needed to ensure that participating commu-
nity members and potential participants are engaged in mul-
tiple activities designed to increase understanding of
HIV-prevention trials. Sites should evaluate how well com-
plex concepts are being communicated in consent and
engagement encounters. Research Ethics Committees
should ask for more detail about the interpersonal strategies
that will be implemented to promote understanding (cf.
Woodsong & Abdool Karim, 2005), in addition to scrutiniz-
ing the adequacy of written consent forms.
Research Agenda
Building on our findings, actual engagement and consent
encounters at HIV vaccine trial sites should be observed,
recorded, and analyzed. This might help open an important
"black box" (cf. Wade, Donovan, Athene-Lane, Neal, &
Hamdy, 2009, p. 2019). Observations could use existing
frameworks, for example, the P-QUIC (Gross-Cohn et al.,
2011), but these should be adapted based on empirical
research with relevant communicators, such as the present
study. Site staff themselves should be involved in develop-
ing user-friendly frameworks that allow them to observe
simulated and real encounters, as part of their in-service
training.Also, the relationship between practices being imple-
mented in such encounters (e.g., promoting discussion) and
outcomes (e.g., enhanced understanding) should be assessed
in future research (cf. MacQueen et al., 2015; Meade, 1999;
Newman et al., 2015) so that site staff can inform their encoun-
ters with empirically informed practices. Further qualitative
research should more fully explore the similarities and differ-
ences in practices used across different site constituencies.
Further qualitative research should explore more thoroughly
implicit tensions between site staff members' multiple goals,
such as whether describing services as part of trust building
may be in tension with efforts to promote understanding of the
site's central purpose to conduct research. Finally, research
with enrolled trial participants (e.g., to explore the perceived
usefulness of strategies such as using analogies) would enable
triangulation of participant perspectives with those of site
staff. In addition, it may be helpful to investigate changes in
understanding and trust across various time points at clinical
trial sites--to ascertain how such phenomena evolve through-
out ongoing contacts. Research with enrolled participants
could comprise ancillary studies attached to "parent" HIV
vaccine trial protocols.
Educational Implications
Role-players at HIV vaccine sites involved in engagement
and consent encounters should have access to training in
core communicative competencies--ideally those with evi-
dence for their usefulness, not only those informed by, for
example, adult education principles. These efforts may help
to make consent-related encounters as "potent" as possible
given finite resources for such trials, and competing claims
on resources. Pressure to transmit multiple, complex con-
cepts "efficiently" should be faced head-on as a potential
threat to effective communication, and best practices for
resolving this tension should be shared. Further training and
educational support should address other potential tensions
identified empirically, for example, how to respect cultural
choices about preferred language while still promoting
understanding.

Note
1. Site constituencies also have access to many educational
materials that use analogies--for example, where prevention
options are compared with a toolbox; Community Advisory
Boards (CABs) are compared with the eyes and ears of the
community, or with a bridge between the researchers and the
community; and an HIV vaccine is compared with a photo-
copy or a scarecrow--implying it lacks the key ingredients to
cause HIV infection.
