Background: Cigarette smoking is responsible for at least
one third of all cancer deaths annually in the United States.
Few sources exist in the peer-reviewed literature document-
ing state and regional differences in smoking behavior,
despite the fact that cancer prevention and control efforts
are increasingly being implemented below the national level.
Purpose: Our goals were to determine smoking prevalence
rates among men and women, by region, and for each of the
50 states and the District of Columbia from census survey
data collected hi 1992 and 1993 and to compare these rates
with rates determined in 1985. Methods: Every month, the
U.S. Bureau of the Census collects labor force statistics on
more than 100 000 individuals on its Current Population
Survey (CPS). For the September 1992, January 1993, and
May 1993 CPS, the National Cancer Institute sponsored a
40-item Tobacco Use Supplement The definition of a cur-
rent smoker changed slightly between 1985 and 1992-1993.
For the 1985 CPS, individuals were considered current
smokers if they had smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime
and were smoking at the time of interview; for the 1992-
1993 CPS, current smokers included anyone who had
smoked 100 cigarettes and was currently smoking every day
or just on some days. We calculated current smoking rates
(every day and some days combined) based on more than a
quarter million adults (n = 266 988) interviewed in 1992-
1993. Results: Substantial geographic variation exists in
rates of current cigarette use among adults within the
United States. In general, adults in the southern United
States have higher rates of smoking and adults in the
western states have lower rates of smoking than adults in the
rest of the country, although differences in smoking be-
havior between men and women and among various racial
and ethnic populations strongly influence these patterns.
Only two states, Kentucky and West Virginia, exhibited
adult smoking rates (men and women combined) of 30% or
higher in 1992-1993; in contrast, in 1985, such rates were
reported from 20 states. The only states in which the
prevalence was below 20% in 1992-1993 were Utah (17.1%)
and California (19.5%). Rates approaching 20% were
reported from New Jersey (20.7%), Massachusetts (21.5%),
and Nebraska, New York, and Hawaii (22.0% each) in 1992-
1993. Rhode Island experienced the greatest relative decline
in smoking prevalence from 1985 to 1992-1993, with a calcu-
lated relative change of -30.7% (based on a change in rate
from 33.5% to 23.2%), followed by Delaware (-25.9%), the
District of Columbia and New Jersey (-23.9% each), Con-
necticut (-23.2%), California (-22.9%), Alaska (-22.8%),
Georgia (-22.6%), Massachusetts (-22.1%), and New York
(-22.0%). Conclusions: Smoking rates are not uniform in the
United States but vary considerably from state to state, even
within the same region of the country. The CPS is the only
mechanism currently capable of simultaneously monitoring
smoking trends nationally, regionally, and on a state-by-
state basis. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1996;88:1748-58]
Cigarette smoking remains the single most preventable cause
of excess cancer mortality in the United States (1-3). To address
this problem, in October 1991 the National Cancer Institute
(NCI), in conjunction with the American Cancer Society (ACS),
began the largest tobacco prevention and control project ever
undertaken in the United States. Called the American Stop
Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention--ASSIST--
it represents the first federally funded program whose specific
aim is to establish a long-term public health infrastructure for
tobacco control at the state level (4). After a year-long national
competition involving 37 states, 17 state health departments
were awarded ASSIST contracts. These 17 states' have a com-
bined population of 91 million people; 23 million are children
under the age of 20 (approximately 2.0 million of whom are
smokers), 10 million are African-American, and 7 million are
either Hispanic or another ethnic minority. Nearly 19 million are
adults who report regular tobacco use (4).
ASSIST also represents a national-state partnership, since it
involves not only the NCI, the ACS, and health departments in
17 states, but also thousands of institutions, agencies, and in-
dividuals who have joined state and local tobacco control coali-
tions (5). The goal of the project is to reduce smoking
prevalence among adults in ASSIST states to no more than 17%
by 1998 and to 15% or less by the year 2000. Reaching these
goals is estimated to result in 4.5 million adults quitting smok-
ing and preventing 2 million children from ever taking up the
habit. Total NCI outlays will exceed $120 million, and the ACS

will contribute an additional $25-$30 million for local staff,
materials, volunteers, and other in-kind support (5).
During the first 24 months of ASSIST (October 1991-September
1993), each state conducted a detailed site analysis and needs as-
sessment. On the basis of this information, each state developed
and published its own 5-year comprehensive smoking control plan.
The 17 ASSIST sites are implementing these plans through 1998 (6).
As part of the planning for ASSIST, the NCI initiated a na-
tional surveillance system to monitor progress and assess pro-
gram impact. The primary outcome of the project will be based
on changes in smoking prevalence as measured by NCI's
Tobacco Use Supplement to the U.S. Bureau of the Census'
Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS Supplement for
1992-1993 was designed to provide base-line estimates for
ASSIST and will be repeated at both the mid-point (1995-1996
CPS) and end of the project (1998-1999 CPS).
This article presents current cigarette smoking estimates for
adults, 20 years of age and older, by region and state, from the
1992-1993 CPS Tobacco Use Supplement conducted by the
Bureau of the Census for September 1992 and January and May
1993. The total sample size for all 3 months of the CPS was
nearly 300 000. This analysis, however, is based on respondents
who were 20 years old or older at the time of interview (n =
266 988). Age 20 years was chosen as the age cut point so that
prevalence estimates would be compatible with the Healthy
People 2000 health objective No. 3.4 (7)--tobacco reduction
among adults--whose stated goal is to "reduce cigarette smoking
to a prevalence of no more than 15% among people aged 20 and
older." In this article, data from the 1992-1993 CPS are presented
and are compared with those from the 1985 CPS (8,9).
Methods
Current Population Survey
The CPS is a continuous monthly survey conducted by the Bureau of the
Census It focuses primarily on labor force indicators for the civilian noninsutu-
tionaJized U.S. population, including individuals 15 years old or older. A 40-
item Tobacco Use Supplement was developed by NCI staff and pretested by
trained Bureau of the Census interviewers prior to full field implementation.
Questions on smoking and tobacco use were added to the CPS for the September
1992, January 1993, and May 1993 surveys.2
The complete CPS methodology has been published in detail elsewhere (/0).
Briefly, the CPS is a probability sample based on a stratified sampling scheme of
clusters of four neighboring households. The three main sources were
households listed in the most recent decennial census (for the 1992-1993 survey,
the 1980 census base was still used), updated building permits, and area sam-
pling where no address lists from the Bureau of the Census exist. The 1992-1993
sample was drawn from 729 primary sampling units comprising 1973 counties
and independent cities with coverage in every state and the District of Columbia.
Approximately 59 000 housing units or living quarters are assigned for inter-
view, and about 56 000 households containing approximately 110000 persons
are interviewed each month. All strata are defined within state boundaries, and
the sample is allocated among the states to produce state, census region and
division, and national labor force estimates, keeping the total sample size to a
minimum. Also included are demographic data for approximately 33 000
children 0-14 years old and 550 Armed Forces members living with civilians
either on or off base within households.
Interviews
Interviews are conducted with a knowledgeable household respondent, who
generally responds for all household members 15 years old or older. Slightly
more than half of all of those interviewed are typically self-respondents, and the
remainder are proxies (10). For the 1992-1993 Tobacco Use Supplement, how-
ever, an attempt was made to minimize the proportion of proxy responses be-
cause answers to some questions of interest to the NCI would be known only by
the person to be interviewed. The Tobacco Use Supplement questionnaire was
administered "off document" on a form separate from the standard labor force
core questionnaire, so that data collection was not constrained by the 1-week
limit for labor statistics collection. This procedure reduced proxy responses to
18%.
Response rates to the CPS labor force core questionnaire for the 3 months
were 95.7%, 95.3%, and 95.2% for September 1992, January 1993, and May
1993, respectively. The corresponding response rates for the Tobacco Use Sup-
plement questionnaire of those responding to the CPS core questionnaire were
88.5% (September 1992), 89.1% (January 1993), and 86.1% (May 1993). All in-
itial household contacts for the CPS are conducted in person. Approximately
25% of all interviews were conducted in person and 75% by telephone.
For all non-English-speaking respondents, interviews were conducted by
foreign language interviewers from a regional office of the Bureau of the Cen-
sus; if a foreign language interviewer was not available, a person from a nearby
university or another household member was recruited. For Spanish language in-
terviews, a fully translated Tobacco Use Supplement was utilized. Data
presented by race and ethnic origin were based on standard Bureau of the Census
classifications. Where estimates were presented for whites and blacks, they were
non-Hispanic.
Both proxy and self-reported responses were used for producing smoking
prevalence estimates summarized in this analysis. Information on adult current
cigarette use obtained from proxies has been shown to closely agree with that
obtained through self-reports in both surveys and clinical trials (11-14). Supple-
ment weights for nonresponse were developed according to a special algorithm
by the Bureau of the Census.
Definitions Used to Determine Smoking Status
Questions measuring smoking status on the 1992-1993 Tobacco Use Supple-
ment were based on the newly developed series of questions adopted for use on
the National Health Interview Survey (15). All respondents were asked if they
had ever smoked 100 cigarettes in their entire life. Those responding "no" were
considered never smokers; those responding "yes" were asked if they currently
smoked cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all. Respondents answering
either "every day" or "some days" were classified as current smokers; those
responding "not at all" were considered former smokers.
Current smoker status in the 1985 CPS was based on slightly different criteria
(8,9,16)- Like the respondents in the 1992-1993 CPS, respondents in the 1985
CPS were asked if they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their entire life;
those responding "no" were classified as never smokers. However, those in-
dividuals who responded "yes" were asked only, "Do you smoke cigarettes
now?" Those responding in the affirmative were considered to be current
smokers, whereas those responding "no" were considered to be former smokers.
For both the 1985 and 1992-1993 surveys, we excluded from the analysis
those individuals responding "don't know" to either the 100-cigarettes question
or to the question "do you smoke now''" (a choice only in 1985). We also ex-
cluded individuals whose responses contained incomplete or missing informa-
tion (including nonrespondents to the supplement).
Standard errors for calculating 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 1992-
1993 data and those estimates based on 1985 CPS data in Table 6 were based on
Bureau of the Census-derived adjustments for the design effect described in the
Bureau's "Sources and Accuracy Statements" provided with its Public Use
Documentation materials. Where P values are presented, they are based on a
two-sided z test.
Results
Sex Differences by Region, Division, and State
As shown in Table 1, the 1992-1993 CPS estimates indicated
a national smoking rate of 26.8% for adult males and 21.8% for
adult females. The rates among adult males in the four regions
(Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) varied from highs of
29.1% and 28.2% reported for those in the South and Midwest,

respectively, to lows of 24.1% and 24.0% for those in the West
and Northeast, respectively.
The smoking rates for divisions within regions are also
presented in Table 1. As might be expected, rates of divisions
tended to parallel regional rates. The East South Central
Division--which includes Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and
Mississippi--had the highest reported smoking rate for males
(32.7%), followed by the East North Central Division (28.8%),
the South Atlantic Division (28.5%), and the West South
Centra] Division (28.2%). The rates for divisions in the West
and Northeast were lower, with the lowest rate occurring in the
Pacific Division (23.7%).
Regional patterns among adult females generally followed
those among males. That is, the higher rates occurred in the
Midwest (23.7%) and the South (22.7%), and the lower rates oc-
curred in the Northeast (21.0%) and the West (18.5%). The
greatest differences between male and female smoking rates
were seen in the South (29.1% for males versus 22.7% for
females).
Among census divisions, the highest smoking rates for
women were reported from the East South Central Division
(25.0%) and the East North Central Division (24.0%). The
lowest rate was reported for women residing in the Pacific
Division (17.5%). Although rates for females paralleled those
for males in the East North Central Division and in the East
South Central Division (male and female rates in each division
being high), the male-female patterns observed for the South
Atlantic Division and the West South Central Division were less
congruent. In the latter case, the rates for males were high, but
the rates reported for females were lower, similar to those in the
New England Division and the Mountain Division.
Moreover, the rates revealed a trend toward less difference
between males and females in regions, divisions, and states
where smoking rates were comparatively lower. For example,
with a few exceptions, the smoking rates for females were only
1 or 2 percentage points lower than those for males for most
states in the Northeast and West, whereas the smoking rates for
females in the Midwest and South were 5-9 percentage points
lower than those for males.
By and large, smoking rates for men and women followed
similar patterns by state (Table 1). A major difference was noted
for North Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi, where the rates
were comparatively higher for males but substantially lower for
females, compared with rates for females elsewhere. But in two
states, Rhode Island and Montana, smoking rates were higher
among women than among men; these are the only states where
this phenomenon was observed. Of interest, the smoking rates
for males and females residing in Utah remained the lowest in
the nation (20.5% and 13.8%, respectively). Similarly, the rates
among adult women in California were just a few percentage
points higher (16.2%) than those among adult women in Utah.
Differences by Race/Ethnicity
Table 2 shows smoking patterns by race/ethnicity and sex for
whites, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders
(Asian/PI), and other races. Prevalence rates among both men
and women and at virtually all geographic levels were highest
among other races. But given the undefined nature of this
category and the relatively smaller sample, the remaining dis-
cussion will focus only on the four major racial/ethnic groups. It
is also important to note that the census does not weight or ad-
just Asian/PI as a group separate from others (see Table 2).
Nationally, among males, the highest rates were reported by
African-Americans (31.3%), followed by whites (26.4%),
Hispanics (25.0%), and Asian/PI (22.8%). Differences in the
smoking rates between white and Hispanic males, whether
measured nationally, regionally, or within the nine census
divisions, were quite small, usually varying by no more than
l%-2%; the notable exception occurred in the West North
Central Division.
Among males, there was a variation in rates by region; e.g.,
the highest prevalence rates for whites were found in the South,
while the highest prevalence rates for African-Americans and
Hispanics were in the Midwest and those for Asian/PI were in
the West. The lowest rates for white and African-American
males were in the Northeast, while the lowest rates for
Hispanics were in the West. Among Asian/PI, there was no dif-
ference between the Northeast, Midwest, and South; rates of ap-
proximately 19% have been reported from all of these regions.
White and African-American females nationally experienced
similar smoking rates (22.9% and 22.5%, respectively), whereas
smoking among Hispanic women (12.7%) and women classified
as Asian/PI (8.0%) was significantly less (P<.0001). Asian/PI
women experienced the lowest smoking rates of all the major
demographic groups in the United States. Regionally, the pat-
tern for women was identical to that seen among men; i.e., the
highest smoking rates were in the South (24.3%) for whites, in
the Midwest for both African-Americans and Hispanics (26.5%
and 16.1%, respectively), and in the West for Asian/PI (8.8%).
The greatest male-female differences nationally within race/
ethnicity were found among Asian/PI (14.8-percentage-point
difference), followed by Hispanics (12.3-percentage-point dif-
ference), African-Americans (8.8-percentage-point difference),
and whites (3.5-percentage-point difference). For all races, the
greatest male-female difference by region was observed in the
South, except for Asian/PI, for whom the largest differences
were seen in the Midwest and West. Generally, however,
smaller differences between men and women, within race, oc-
curred in the West and Northeast.
Differences by Age, Sex, and Region
Table 3 reports smoking rates for males and females by 10-
year age groups, by census region, and by division. With only a
few exceptions, smoking prevalence was highest through ages
30-39 years for both men and women, then declined with in-
creasing age. Men experienced higher smoking prevalence than
women at practically every age and geographic level, with the
single exception of 60- to 69-year-old women in the New
England Division. Male-female differences by age were
greatest in the South, where a consistent 5- to 7-percentage-
point difference existed between the sexes for nearly every age,
except those in the very oldest age category, where the rates nar-
rowed considerably; a similar pattern was observed for each of
the three southern divisions as well. Smaller differences in
prevalence were noted between men and women in the youngest
age group (ages 20-29 years) in the Northeast Region and the

Midwest Region, but this pattern was not seen in the South or
West, where a 5- to 6-percentage-point difference persisted.
Differences by Occupation
Table 4 presents smoking rates by occupation, sex, region,
and division. Among both males and females, the highest rates
of smoking for each of the three major occupational groups oc-
curred in the Midwest and the South. The rate of smoking
among blue-collar and service workers was significantly higher
(P^.0001) than that of their white-collar peers. This finding was
true for both men and women and was consistent across all
geographic levels.
Nationally, it is interesting to note that female white-collar
workers reported slightly higher smoking prevalence rates than
male white-collar workers (20.8% versus 19.8%, respectively).
Compared with male white-collar workers, female white-collar
workers had higher rates of smoking in virtually every geographic
part of the country (i.e., three out of four regions and every
division, except the Pacific). Female blue-collar workers living in
the West and, to a somewhat lesser extent, female service workers
living in the same region reported lower smoking rates than their
counterparts in the other regions of the country (Table 4).
Rates of 40% or greater were observed among male blue-col-
lar workers in the South (including two of three southern
divisions) and among male service workers in the West North
Centra] Division in the Midwest. The highest rate among
females was observed among blue-collar workers in the Mid-
west Region, where the rate was 38.8%--a rate identical to that
reported for male blue-collar workers in the region.
Among females residing in the West, an interesting pattern
was seen in the smoking rates among the occupational groups
between the Mountain Division and the Pacific Division, where
rates were lower in the latter compared with the former. This
pattern was especially pronounced among women working in
blue-collar and service jobs. For example, female blue-collar
workers in the Pacific Division reported a prevalence rate of
21.0% compared with a 32.9% prevalence rate among female
blue-collar workers in the Mountain Division.
State Ranking by Sex
Sex-specific smoking prevalence rankings, both high and
low, by state are presented in Table 5. Rankings based on results
from the 1992-1993 CPS were compared with rankings based on
results from the 1985 CPS. It should be noted, however, that

these rankings are somewhat artificial in the sense that small
differences in prevalence can separate one state from another.
Among the 10 highest ranking states in 1992-1993, all reported
male smoking prevalence to be at or above 30%; no state
reported a rate of 30% or greater for females. States with the
highest smoking rates were in the South; although this was true
for both men and women, it was especially evident among men
included in the 1992-1993 CPS, in which all but three of the
highest ranking states were from the South.
Among the states ranking lowest in smoking rates of in-
habitants, those in the Northeast and the West dominated the
rankings determined from the CPS data in 1992-1993.
Among males, five of the 10 states with the lowest rates were
from the Northeast Region; in contrast, among females, the
lowest rates were in the West. This pattern was considerably
different from rankings according to sex in 1985 (Table 5),
where the West dominated the rankings (six states) among
men, but rankings were more evenly divided between the
South and the West for women. Among women, only one
state (Texas) from the South was listed among the 10 lowest
in prevalence in 1992-1993.
State Smoking Rates in 1985 Versus 1992-1993
In Table 6, data on overall smoking prevalence are presented
by state for 1985 and 1992-1993; the states are arranged al-
phabetically, and the relative percent change between the two
time periods is provided. All data were based on adults (men
and women combined). The number in parentheses next to.each
state represents the state's rank in prevalence based on 1992-
1993 CPS results, from highest (No. 1) to lowest.
In 1985, the five states with the highest overall adult smoking
rates (men and women combined) were Nevada (36.5%), Alaska
(35.5%), Kentucky (35.4%), Michigan (33.7%), and Rhode Is-
land (33.5%); 15 other states reported rates of 30% or higher. In
1992-1993, only two states, Kentucky (32.2%) and West Vir-
ginia (30.5%), reported smoking rates of 30% or greater.
With the exception of Utah, most states have experienced a
decline in smoking prevalence; for a few, however, prevalence
has remained flat in the approximately 8 years between the two
studies. For some states the rate of decline is quite substantial,
whereas in other states such progress has been relatively slow.
States that are traditionally considered to be tobacco-producing
states have experienced a considerable decline in smoking

prevalence. In Virginia and Maryland, for example, smoking has
declined 21.2% and 18.4%, respectively, since 1985, while it
declined 12.9% in North Carolina. The rate of decline in Kentucky
has been more modest, whereas prevalence of smoking in adults in
Tennessee and South Carolina has changed little (Table 6).
Of all states, however, Rhode Island has had the greatest rela-
tive decline in adult smoking (-30.7%) since 1985. Delaware
was next with nearly a 26% decline in prevalence, followed by
the District of Columbia and New Jersey (-23.9% each), Connec-
ticut (-23.2%), California (-22.9%), Alaska (-22.8%), Georgia
(-22.6%), Massachusetts (-22.1 %), and New York (-22.0%).
Nationally, smoking prevalence declined 17% overall since
1985, with men doing only slightly better than women. Among
the four regions of the country, there was considerable variation
in the rate of decline (data not shown). Prevalence declined the
most in the Northeast (-20.5%) and the West (-19.1%) and the
least in the Midwest (-12.9%), followed by the South (-16.1%).
Discussion
Consideration of potential limitations in survey methodology
that may affect interpretation of results are in order. Although
there was a change in the definition of current smoker between
the two Current Population Surveys, the impact of this change
on any real difference in smoking prevalence should be mini-
mal. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion in analyzing their own survey results, just a 0.9% difference
in prevalence could be attributed to the new definition based on
their analysis of 1992 data from the National Health Interview
Survey (75). The percentage of proxy responses obtained on the
1992-1993 CPS (18%) was considerably smaller than that ob-
tained in 1985 (45%). As noted earlier, however, other studies
(77-74) have shown that proxy responses for estimating adult
smoking behavior correspond well with self-responses. A
strength of the CPS comparisons over time comes from other
aspects of the design and interview methodology that were con-
stant for both surveys.
Other variations in methodology, such as personal versus
telephone interview, and potential biases of nonresponse to the
supplement within a given survey should also be minimal. For
example, the overall response rate to the 1992-1993 CPS core
questionnaire was extremely high (nearly 96%), leaving little
room for significant response rate variability over the different

states. More importantly, the larger component of the non-
response rate, nonresponse to the supplement among those com-
pleting the CPS core questionnaire, varied little by state, ranging
from 5.4% in Iowa to 17.8% in New York. Likewise, the actual
percentages of interviews conducted by telephone did not vary
much by state (66.9% in the District of Columbia [which, for the
purpose of this argument, is considered as a state] to 82.8% in
Maryland). The rather high overall response rate can be at-
tributed to the fact that all initial household contacts for the CPS
are made in person, regardless of whether data collection for
either the CPS core or the supplement is accomplished via face-
to-face or telephone interviewing.
Similar to findings based on 1985 CPS results (8,16), analysis
of CPS data for 1992-1993 revealed substantial variation in rates
of current cigarette use within the United States. In general, the
South and Midwest experienced higher rates of smoking
prevalence than the rest of the country, and the West ex-
perienced the lowest, although differences in smoking behavior
between men and women and among various ethnic and racial
groups within regions strongly influence these patterns. There
was also considerable variability in smoking among the major
racial and ethnic groups of the population nationally, with the
highest rates recorded among African-American males (31.3%)
and the lowest among Asian/PI females (8.0%).

Changes in the age at which smoking prevalence begins to decline
was somewhat different in 1992-1993 than in 1985, when rates
remained elevated until ages 40-49 years before they declined. In the
current analysis, smoking rates declined after ages 30-39 years.
Smoking rates for women working in white-collar oc-
cupations now exceed those of their white-collar male
counterparts. This is the first time such a crossover has
been reported and may indicate the generally lower rates of
cessation observed in women than in men. Smoking among
male white-collar workers decreased nearly 25% since
1985 compared with 19% among female white-collar
workers. As noted earlier, female white-collar workers in 1992-
1993 experienced higher rates of smoking than male white-col-
lar workers in virtually every part of the United States. Declines
in smoking among male service workers and blue-collar
workers since 1985 were not as steep as those observed among
their white-collar peers. Nevertheless, smoking rates declined
16% among male service workers and 12% among male blue-
collar workers during this period. Smoking rates among female
service and blue-collar workers each declined 11% since 1985.
Many of the states that ranked high in smoking prevalence in
the 1985 CPS also ranked high in the latest analysis, and this
1756 ARTICLES Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 88, No. 23, December 4, 1996
was true for both men and women. There are, however, several
notable exceptions. For example, Alaskan males had the highest
smoking rates in 1985 at 42.6%; however, by 1992-1993, just
28.4% were smoking--a 33% decline--nearly double the rate
of decline seen in males nationally. Smoking declined among
Alaskan females as well, but the rate of decline in women was
considerably lower than that in Alaskan men. The reasons for
this sharp decline among men but not among women are un-
clear, but they could be related to changes in the state's
demographic makeup between the two study periods.
Utah continues to experience the lowest overall smoking
prevalence rate of any state in the nation, a position it also held
in 1985. While prevalence increased in Utah between the two
study periods, the difference was not statistically significant (P
- .1052). Smoking was slightly higher in Wisconsin in 1992-
1993 (26.2%) than in 1985 (25.7%), but the 95% confidence in-
terval around the increase included no change. Smoking in
several states (Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri,
Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee,
and West Virginia) can also be characterized as relatively un-
changed.
Rhode Island experienced the greatest relative decline in
smoking prevalence since 1985 (-30.7%). Other states worth
noting for their decline in smoking prevalence include Delaware
(-25.9%), New Jersey (-23.9%), Connecticut (-23.2%), Califor-
nia (-22.9%), Alaska (-22.8%), Georgia (-22.6%), Massa-
chusetts (-22.1%), and New York (-22.0%). California, which
was already reporting relatively low rates for men and women in
1985, has improved its position in the latest survey. California
ranked ninth lowest in prevalence among men and fifth lowest
among women in the 1985 study; it is now the fifth and second
lowest among men and women, respectively, and the second
lowest overall. The decline in smoking among California adults
is attributed, to a large extent, to the aggressive statewide smok-
ing control actions implemented there in 1989 following a $.25-
per-pack increase in the state excise tax {17). However, other
factors may have contributed to the decline, including an in-
crease in populations whose smoking histories have been tradi-
tionally much lower than those of other demographic groups
(e.g., Asian and Hispanic females).
Regardless, California and Utah are the only states where
smoking is under 20% among adults. Several other states, in-
cluding New Jersey (20.7%), Massachusetts (21.5%), and
Hawaii, Nebraska, and New York (each 22.0%), are reporting
rates in the low 20's percentiles and should soon be below 20%
if current trends continue. Massachusetts may be particularly
well positioned to reach this goal. Like California, Mas-
sachusetts increased its cigarette excise tax by $.25 a pack in
January 1993, and a substantial portion of the revenues was
dedicated to a statewide tobacco-use reduction initiative. A
sharp drop in cigarette sales (-12.5%) was recorded in Mas-
sachusetts between 1992 and 1993 compared with just a 3%
decline nationally {18).
Finally, as smoking control is increasingly seen as a com-
munity health priority, it will become increasingly important to
have a surveillance mechanism in place that is capable of sys-
tematically monitoring changes in tobacco use at the state and
local levels (5,7). In addition to NCI's 17-state ASSIST demon-
stration project, in 1993 the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention initiated its own program--IMPACT (Initiatives to
Mobilize for the Prevention and Control of Tobacco Use)--for
states not receiving funding under ASSIST (6). While the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide funding to
more states (32 states and the District of Columbia), annual
funding under IMPACT is more modest, averaging about $150 000
per state, compared with ASSIST's approximately $1 million
per state. Both programs, however, share many common charac-
teristics, including an emphasis on policy-based interventions to
reduce smoking among both adults and children. More recently,
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation announced formation of
its own program--called Smokeless States--which provides ad-
ditional fiscal support to 19 states. This program, however, does
not support comprehensive statewide programs for all states
receiving funding.
The CPS, with its comprehensive sampling scheme (more than
700 primary sampling units) and large sample size (100 000 in-
terviews per month), is ideally suited to accurately monitor state
tobacco use trends as well as trends in other areas. For example,
the Tobacco Use Supplement collects data on cessation counsel-
ing by physicians and dentists; on the existence of workplace
smoking policies and the characteristics of those policies (19);
on public attitudes toward smoking restrictions in various public
settings, such as restaurants, indoor worksites, and indoor shop-
ping malls (19); and on public opinion about smoking control
policies, such as the ease with which minors can buy tobacco in
their communities.
Many of the questions contained on the NCI Tobacco Use
Supplement represent areas for which state health departments
are increasingly taking responsibility or represent areas that
states may be required to monitor under various federal require-
ments. For example, Public Law 102-321 (commonly known as
the Synar Amendment) and the more recently proposed Food
and Drug Administration regulations are specifically intended to
reduce smoking rates among youth by reducing illegal sales of
cigarettes and tobacco products to minors (20, 21). The supple-
ment can help monitor trends related to many of these issues.
Furthermore, the CPS collects information on tobacco use
among all household members 15 years of age and older; thus,
the CPS can help monitor, at least on a national-regional basis,
the 15- to 19-year-old age group.
The Tobacco Use Supplement was specifically designed by
the NCI to provide prevalence and other information for its 17-
state ASSIST demonstration project, but because the CPS in-
cludes information on all states in its sampling scheme, not just
those involved in ASSIST, data are available for each of the 50
states and the District of Columbia. Furthermore, beginning in
1995, the Bureau of the Census increased the number of primary
sampling units in its sampling scheme to 818 (by way of com-
parison, the National Health Interview Survey in 1994 increased
the number of primary sampling units used in its sampling
scheme from 201 to 400); thus, both coverage and reliability of
state estimates collected via the CPS should be enhanced even
further.
