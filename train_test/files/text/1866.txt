Consent for genetic research in a general
population: An update on the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey experience
Geraldine M. McQuillan, PhD1, Qiyuan Pan, PhD1, and Kathryn S. Porter, MD1
Purpose: The study determines the consent rates for storage of biologic samples for future research with and
without genetic studies and describes trends in sociodemographic factors associated with consent. Methods: We
performed an analysis of the characteristics of consenting individuals participating in three data cycles of the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the U.S. population.
Results: In the 1999 to 2000 and the 2001 and 2002 surveys, 84.8% and 90.1% of eligible participants,
respectively, consented to have their biologic samples including DNA stored in a national repository. Female and
non-Hispanic black participants were least likely to consent when genetic studies and DNA were included. In the
2003 to 2004 survey, with the discontinuation of the DNA collection, 98.4% signed the consent document and
these race/gender differences were no longer observed. Conclusion: Females and non-Hispanic blacks consis-
tently had lower consent rates during the survey years when genetic studies were mentioned in the consent, but
once DNA collection was discontinued these differences disappeared. These findings demonstrate wide accep-
tance among survey participants for allowing storage of specimens for future studies but indicate the need to
explore race/gender issues with the collection and storage of DNA for genetic research. Genet Med 2006:8(6):

Key Words: informed consent, genetic research, survey, representative sample
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), a representative sample of the United States pop-
ulation, randomly selects 5000 individuals each year to partic-
ipate in the survey. Individuals who agree to participate are
interviewed in the home and then are scheduled to be exam-
ined in the Mobile Examination Centers (MECs) a few weeks
after the home interview. The informed consent document for
the examination and the separate consent for the storage of
biologic specimens for future use are presented to the partici-
pant after the interview in the home is completed. In 2003
we analyzed data from the 1999 and 2000 survey years to de-
scribe the sociodemographic predictors of the willingness of
NHANES participants to sign the consent and allow their bio-
logic specimens to be used for genetic research.1 We now pro-
vide an update on the NHANES experience with consent for
storage of biologic specimens for future studies during the 4
years of the survey when DNA was collected and the 2 years
when it was dropped from the protocol. We also examined the
trends among sociodemographic factors associated with con-
sent over time.
METHODS
Survey design
NHANES, a series of cross-sectional national surveys con-
ducted since 1971 by the National Center for Health Statistics
of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ob-
tains a nationally representative sample of the U.S. civilian
noninstitutionalized population. The surveys use a complex,
stratified, multistage probability sample design with unequal
probabilities of selection to oversample certain subgroups of
people, such as adolescents, African-Americans, and Mexican
Americans.2 In 1999, NHANES became a continuous survey
with 2-year data-release cycles. Persons participating in each
survey year are representative of the U.S. population and are
examined once in the MECs, with no longitudinal follow-up.
Similar procedures were used to select the sample and conduct
the interviews and examinations as in previous NHANES
surveys.3 The surveys provide national statistics on the health
and nutritional status of the U.S. population. One of the goals
of the survey in the 1999 to 2002 survey was to establish a
national probability sample of biologic specimens including
genetic material for future research. During the 2003 to 2004
survey years, DNA collection was dropped from the protocol
because of funding constraints.

Data collection for NHANES occurs at three levels: a brief
household screening interview, an in-depth household survey
interview, and a medical examination in a special MEC. Con-
sent for the examination and a separate consent for the collec-
tion of the specimens for future studies were obtained after the
individual was selected for participation in the study and the
household interview was completed. Only participants aged 20
years or older were eligible for DNA collection in the 1999 to
2002 survey, although biologic samples for future research
were collected on all age ranges with either parental or individ-
ual consent or assent. Although the consent included the pos-
sibility of extracting DNA from saliva, only whole blood was
processed for DNA extraction. The NHANES survey and con-
sent documents were approved by the National Center for
Health Statistics Research Ethics Review Board.
This article presents the trends in the percentage of partici-
pants who signed the "Specimen Storage and Continuing
Studies" consent form during the three 2-year cycles of the
survey. There were minor changes to the consent document in
20001 and a major revision in 2003 and 2004 with the discon-
tinuation of the collection of DNA for future genetic studies.
The consent documents used for the storage of biologic speci-
mens in 1999 and 2000 were previously published.1 The con-
sent form used in the 2001 to 2002 survey that included DNA
collection and future genetic studies and the 2003 to 2004 sur-
vey document without this collection are presented in Figures
1 and 2 (online only).
NHANES participants were informed that all the health data
collected would be kept strictly private and that the staff were
not allowed to discuss their participation in the survey under
penalty of Federal law: Sections 308 (d) of the Public Health
Service Act (42 USC 242m) and the Privacy Act of 1974 (5USC
552C). Participants who were interviewed and examined, and
who agreed to storage of their specimens cannot be identified
by any researcher using the NHANES public use microdata
files. Data are recategorized, top coded, and/or suppressed be-
fore public release if there is any potential for identification of
participants.
The purpose of collecting the stored specimens was to pro-
vide a resource for new scientific laboratory tests, including
genetic tests, that were not available when the participant was
examined. Therefore, the participant was informed that no
specific studies were currently planned, and that researchers
using their samples would not be contacting them for any ad-
ditional information. They were also told that NCHS would
not contact them with specific results but would provide infor-
mation on the studies being conducted in a newsletter. Propos-
als for use of their specimens would be reviewed for scientific
merit and by an institutional review board to ensure that the
proposed research was ethical. Finally, they were told they
could remove their specimens at any time and were given a
toll-free number to obtain information.
The number of adults aged 20 or more years selected for
the survey was 6401 in the 1999 to 2000 survey, 6941 in the
2001 to 2002 survey, and 6971 in the 2003 to 2004 survey.
Race/ethnicity based on self-report was categorized as non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican Ameri-
can. Individuals who did not self-select into these categories
were classified as "other." Poverty-index was calculated by
dividing total family income by the poverty threshold index
adjusted for family size at the year of interview. All inter-
views were conducted in English or Spanish. If another language
was spoken by the participant, a family member or local inter-
preter translated the interview from English. Samples sizes in the
poverty index and years of education categories do not equal the
total population because of item nonresponse for these variables.
With the addition of a separate consent document for
specimen storage and continuing studies including DNA
collection in 1999, interviewers expressed some concerns
that they needed more training to adequately explain the
purpose and potential use of the specimen repository. In
2000 the NHANES program held several training sessions
for the interviewers and provided fact sheets and brochures
to address the use of the bank and the protections that were
in place to ensure that all studies would have adequate tech-
nical and ethical review. Interviewers reported that these
materials were helpful with answering concerns and in ob-
taining respondent cooperation.
Participants were able to check a box on the consent form
that allowed the storage of blood, urine, or saliva for future
studies and sign the form but not agree to have blood or saliva
kept for future studies using their genes.
Statistical analysis
These analyses are based on data used to monitor the survey
operations. Rates are therefore not weighted to produce na-
tional estimates. Consent rates and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) and logistic regression analysis were computed using SAS
version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC). Differences between
subpopulations or survey years were evaluated by examining P
values calculated using a univariate t statistic. To correct for
multiple comparisons within categories within a survey cycle
or between the survey cycles, the Bonferroni correction was
applied to this P value.4
All variables examined were entered into a logistic regres-
sion model to determine which factors independently contrib-
uted to an unwillingness to consent in the two study cycles that
included the collection of DNA for genetic research. The other
racial/ethnic group was deleted from the logistic regression
because of the small sample size and the diverse composition of
the group, and the language of interview was not modeled
because it was not evenly distributed among the three race/
ethnic groups. All other variables were included to control for
the effect of age, education, or income on response, and pair-
wise interactions in the model were explored using a P  .05
from the Wald chi-square to test for significance.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the overall response rates to the household
interview for each of the three data-release cycles (1999Â­2000,
2001Â­2002, and 2003Â­2004) for individuals aged 20 or more

years. Response rates for the interview varied from 72% to 78%
over the 6 years of the survey included in this report. In most
survey years non-Hispanic whites were less likely to agree to be
interviewed. There was no significant sex difference in inter-
view consent rates, and in all survey years individuals aged 60
or more years were less likely to participate than younger age
groups. Response rates between survey years were significantly
higher in the 2001 to 2002 survey compared with the 1999 to
2000 survey, but were significantly lower in the 2003 to 2004
survey when compared with the 2001 to 2002 cycle among the
total population and Mexican Americans.
Table 2 presents the percentage of interviewed individuals
who signed the "Specimen Storage and Continuing Studies"
consent document. There were significant increases in the per-
centage of participants consenting between the 1999 to 2000
and 2001 to 2002 survey cycles in every demographic group
observed except between those aged 50 to 59 years. This signif-
icant increase between survey cycles was even more dramatic
between the 2001 to 2002 and 2003 to 2004 survey cycles when
the mention of DNA collection for genetic studies was re-
moved from the consent document. This significant increase
was observed in every demographic category.
In 1999 and 2000, non-Hispanic blacks compared with non-
Hispanic whites, females, and those with a poverty index less
than 1 were significantly less likely to consent to future re-
search, whereas those aged 40 to 59 years were more likely to
consent compared with those aged 60 or more years. In 2001
and 2002, females and those living at or above the poverty level
were less likely to consent, whereas those with less than a high
school education were more likely to consent compared with
those with some college education and those aged 40 to 59
years compared with the participants aged 60 or more years.
Although participants were given the option of signing the
consent form but not checking the box allowing their genes to
be used for future studies in the 1999 to 2002 survey, only 43
individuals in 1999 and 2000 and 38 individuals in 2001 and
2002 used this option and signed the form.
The removal of the mention of DNA collection for genetic
studies from the consent document in 2003 and 2004 also re-
moved the significant decrease in consent by non-Hispanic
blacks and females. In-fact, non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican
Americans were significantly more likely than non-Hispanic
whites to consent to the storage of specimens.
To determine independent predictors for not consenting to
future studies that included genetic research, the 1999 to 2002
data were modeled controlling for age, education, and poverty
index (Table 3). Non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity was the
strongest predictor for not consenting, followed by female sex.
Individuals aged 40 to 59 years were significantly more likely to
consent when compared with those age 60 or more years.
DISCUSSION

tative specimen bank of biologic specimens, including DNA,
for future health studies. High response rates are important to
the survey so response bias can be reduced or controlled and
estimates generalizable to the U.S. population can be pro-
duced.
We first reported differences by demographic groups in ac-
ceptance of the "Specimen Storage and Continuing Studies"
component of the survey based on response rates in 1999 and
2000.1 Participants were told that no results from future testing
of their biologic samples would be returned to them and that
they could remove their samples at any time. A toll-free num-
ber was provided on the consent form so they could call to
remove their samples. The NHANES interviewers did not re-
ceive comments on not returning future test results, and no

participant, to date, has ever called to remove his or her sam-
ples. Extensive training of our interviewers and the provision
of answers to commonly asked questions (Appendix 1) signif-
icantly increased this response rate in every demographic cat-
egory between the two cycles of the survey that contained the
collection of DNA for future genetic studies. Training and in-
formation did not change the significantly lower response rates
for non-Hispanic blacks compared with whites and females
compared with males observed in the 1999 to 2000 and 2001 to
2002 surveys. Other studies have demonstrated that minority
race/ethnic groups are less willing to participate in genetic
research.5,6 The consistently lower consent rates for females
during the years when consent was sought to store specimens
for future genetic studies have not been seen in clinical genetic
studies;6,7 however, a population-based study in Japan found
that female gender and older age were factors for nonpartici-
pation in a population-based cohort study involving genetic
research.8 Because NHANES participants are selected to be
representative of the general U.S. population with no selection
if there was any disease or condition, the lack of a personal
incentive of a clinically relevant reason to participate in the
collection and storage of blood for continuing studies that in-
clude genetic studies may impact women more than men when
faced with the decision to sign the consent document. A logis-
tic regression analysis to determine independent predictors for
not signing the consent document with the genetic research
included demonstrated that being non-Hispanic black or fe-
male was the independent predictor for not consenting after
controlling for age, education, and poverty index.
When the mention of genes and DNA was removed from the
Continuing Studies consent document in 2003 and 2004, there
was no longer a significant decrease in consent by non-His-
panic blacks and females. Consent also increased from 90.1%
to 98.4%. This change suggests that the concept of genetic re-
search was a cause for concern for some participants in the
NHANES survey because removing words directly linking the
collection to genetic research significantly increased response
rates in every demographic category when the 2003 to 2004
survey was compared with the 2001 to 2002 or 1999 to 2000
surveys when genes were mentioned.
The debate on the appropriate consent for the collection and
storage of biologic samples is ongoing and not restricted to
only the NHANES project.6,9 Because the NHANES is a general
health study with no overarching disease or condition driving
the data collection, a general consent was requested with the
only limitation that the future studies will look at health con-
ditions. This authorization of unlimited future research has
been examined in two recent studies with the conclusion that
although research participants want to know and consent for
the storage of their biologic specimens, the majority of partic-
ipants studied were not concerned with the particular disease
that would be studied.6,9 During the two 2-year survey cycles
when DNA and genetic studies were included on the consent
document, we offered our participants the option of storage of
blood, urine, and saliva while not agreeing to the storage of
blood to look at genes. Less than 1% of participants chose to
check this box and still sign the consent form. We conclude
that we could not properly articulate this option in the consent
document; therefore, we plan on a simplified approach to con-
sent for continuing studies in future cycles of the survey that
includes the storage of biologic samples to be used for future
heath studies including studies using genes.
The results of this current analysis of consent for specimen
storage and continuing studies suggest that there is general
acceptance across the demographic groups for participation in
future research including genetic research in the general U.S.
population. As our interviewers, who presented the consent
document, gained experience with explaining this component,
consent rates improved in every category examined. Although
there was a 90% acceptance of future studies including genetic
studies in 2001 and 2002, once the mention of the collection of
DNA was removed in the 2003 to 2004 cycle consent form,
consent was almost universal with the lowest consent rate in
the 60 years or older age group.
The NHANES program is planning to reintroduce the col-
lection of DNA in the 2007 to 2008 survey. The declining cost
of DNA preparation has provided an opportunity to include
this component in the survey. Because we now have experience
with the use of our DNA and can provide examples of the type
of genetic projects approved for use of the NHANES DNA
samples, we hope we can continue to improve our consent

rates and address any concerns that participants might have
about the use of their biologic samples.10 Our experience be-
tween the 1999 to 2000 and 2001 to 2002 survey years demon-
strates that interviewer training with specific information that
addresses the participants' questions and concerns can signif-
icantly improve consent rates.

APPENDIX 1
Future Research Q & A's
What type of genetic research will be conducted using my DNA
sample?
Only research that tries to learn more about the health and
nutrition of people living in the United States. Conditions
likely to be looked at are those we ask questions about during
the interview.
How can I be sure this is the only research that will be
conducted?
All research studies have to be approved by a group of people
who represent you called a review board. They are members of
the community and outside scientists who are not involved in
the survey. They oversee all research studies to ensure that only
safe health research is conducted.
Will my DNA be shared with law enforcement or other Federal
agencies not doing health research?
No! All health information and blood samples collected dur-
ing the survey are kept strictly private. Under penalty of Fed-
eral law (section 308(d) of the Public Health Service Act [42
USC 242m] and the Privacy Act of 1974 [5 USC 552A]) we
cannot give out your name, or any other information that
could identify you.
If you agree to future research and the project is approved by
the review board, no personal identifying information will be
linked to the samples that the researchers use.
Samples will NEVER be shared with any agency or person
who is not doing health research.
Can you use my DNA sample for cloning?
No! The samples we collect cannot be used for cloning.
Why should I agree to future research?
Many important scientific discoveries have been made using
samples from previous NHANES surveys.
Samples from the NHANES conducted in the late 1970s
showed that some Americans were more likely to be infected
with the hepatitis B virus. This discovery resulted in a universal
immunization program that began in 1991.
Stored samples have also been used to discover differences in
nutrition, communities that might not have adequate child-
hood vaccinations, what causes tooth decay, and indicators of
exposures to toxins in the environment. This information
helps Congress identify problems that need national support to
meet health objectives.
Without stored samples from you and your fellow survey
participants, we will not be able to continue to look at the
health of the nation as new scientific discoveries are made.
What have stored blood samples from NHANES been used for in
the past?
You and other people who participate in the survey repre-
sent all Americans. When we test your blood we are able to see
what the general health of the population looks like. In the past
we have measured:
 how many people had been vaccinated with the measles
vaccine
 how many people had been exposed to the hepatitis vi-
ruses
 how many people had sufficient vitamin levels from their
diet
 how many people had been exposed to pesticides
 how many people were allergic to latex
The Centers for Disease Control use specimens that come
from general surveys such as NHANES to compare communi-
ties that have an outbreak of an infection with the general pop-
ulation. Your samples become a control group representing
the general population that is compared with samples from
infected communities. This comparison helps identify the
cause of an outbreak. In the past, stored NHANES samples
have helped identify the cause(s) of:
 Hantavirus*
 Legionnaire's disease*
 Toxic shock syndrome*

*Hantavirus:Hantavirusesarecarriedbynumerousrodentspecies
throughouttheworld.In1993,apreviouslyunknowngroupofhan-
taviruses emerged in the United States and caused an acute respira-
tory disease now called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
*Legionnaire's disease: An acute illness, commonly charac-
terized by fever, cough, and pneumonia. In the early 1980s, this
disease was described and identified by the Centers for Disease
Control when a group of Legionnaires attending a convention
in a Philadelphia hotel developed pneumonia with a high fa-
tality rate.
*Toxic shock syndrome: This was identified in the 1980s
when a new super-absorbent tampon came on the market.
Women using this product developed staph infections. Some
died of shock.
*Lyme disease: Increased deer populations and suburban
migration have exposed people to deer ticks that carry this
newly described disease. Lyme disease was first recognized in
the United States in 1975, after a mysterious outbreak of ar-
thritis near Lyme, Connecticut. Since then, reports of Lyme
disease have increased dramatically, and the disease has be-
come an important public health problem in some areas of
the United States. Symptoms include fever, chills, rash, and
arthritis.
