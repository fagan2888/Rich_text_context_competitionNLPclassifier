Objectives. The use of, and changes in the use of, formal (paid) and informal care by elderly persons who are chron-
ically disabled and living in the community was studied.
Methods. Estimates were made of the sources and volume of home care use for persons reporting chronic disability
in the 1982, 1989, and 1994 National Long Term Care Surveys. Comparisons were made across disability intensity, sur-
vey data, and age.
Results. The analyses showed changes over time in the sources of home care services. Generally, the combined use
of both paid and informal home health care increased, whereas the use of either source of care alone decreased. The
amount spent on formal care increased with disability level and age.
Discussion. Use of formal sources of care by community disabled elderly residents increased, likely because of
changes in the Medicare home health care benefits in 1989. Increased use of home health care was associated with the
concurrent use of informal care.
XPANDING public financing for home-based long-
term care (LTC) for disabled elderly persons is an issue
that has been debated for almost two decades. Limited pub-
lic funding is currently available for home care, largely
through Medicare and Medicaid, and only under specific
circumstances. Public spending for home care is a fraction
of the spending for nursing home care, even though the ma-
jority of elderly persons needing LTC reside in the commu-
nity and prefer home care. The majority of home care re-
ceived by disabled elderly persons is provided by family
members (Manton, Stallard, & Corder, 1995), many of
whom incur substantial personal and economic costs.
The rapid growth of the elderly population is likely to in-
crease future LTC demand. How future LTC requirements
will be met is important for elderly persons and their fami-
lies. It will be helpful to know who is receiving home care,
what the sources of payments are, and how much out-of-
pocket costs are incurred. To examine national trends and
patterns of use of home care, and sources of payment, we
analyzed the 1982, 1989, and 1994 National Long Term
Care Surveys (NLTCS) and described the use and payment
for home care between 1982 and 1994 by disabled elderly
persons.
LTC encompassing a range of health, social, and residen-
tial services compensates for disabilities caused by physical,
cognitive, or mental impairments. Physical disabilities can
be measured in terms of dependencies in activities of daily
living (ADLs) or in instrumental activities of daily living
(IADLs; Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson & Jaffe, 1963;
Lawton & Brody, 1969). ADL dependencies result in need
for assistance in personal care functions. Five ADLs are
widely used--bathing, dressing, transferring from bed or
chair, toileting, and eating. Dependency in IADLs reflects
difficulties performing household chores such as preparing
meals, shopping for groceries, and managing money. Some
IADLs reflect cognitive as well as physical impairments.
Approximately three quarters of disabled older persons
reside in community settings and receive LTC from infor-
mal sources such as spouses and other family members (Liu &
Manton, 1994). A smaller proportion of disabled older persons
receive LTC from informal sources and paid caregivers.
The roles of informal and paid caregivers differ depending
on the circumstances of the disabled older person. Paid care
might substitute for informal care in some situations and
complement informal care in others (Greene, 1983). In a
small proportion of cases, disabled older persons use only paid
assistance, for example, when the informal care network is
fragile and only small amounts of home-based LTC are
needed. Whether disabled persons receive home-based care
from informal sources only, both informal and paid sources, or
only paid sources reflects the type and level of disability,
strength of the informal caregiver network, financial resources,
and availability of services.
Long-Term Care Expenditures
In 1996, $109 billion was spent on LTC: $79 billion for
nursing homes and $30 billion for home-based care (Levit et
al., 1997). Of the $30 billion spent on home care, Medicare
financed 45%; state and local sources, particularly Medicaid,
paid 14%. Individuals paid 20% out of pocket. All other
sources (e.g., private insurance) financed the balance.
Medicaid limits coverage to people who are poor by wel-
fare program standards or who become poor by incurring
health care expenses. Medicaid's LTC expenditures are

mostly for nursing home care; in 1996 Medicaid's LTC ex-
penditures for elderly persons were $31 billion--82% for
nursing homes. The remaining expenditures were incurred
for home health, personal, and other home and community-
based care. Because states have not been uniform in their
provision of home and community-based services under
Medicaid, access to services varies greatly (Coughlin, Ku, &
Holahan, 1994).
Medicare focuses on coverage of acute health care costs,
although liberalization of eligibility and coverage policies
has resulted in sometimes long periods of service use for
some beneficiaries. To qualify for home health services, a
person must be in need of skilled nursing care or therapy
services on an intermittent basis. Most chronically disabled
people do not need skilled care but rather nonmedical sup-
portive care and assistance with self-care functions.
Three other programs--the Social Services Block Grant
(SSBG), the Older Americans Act, and the Supplemental
Security Income (SSI) program--provide support for com-
munity-based LTC for impaired elderly persons. Because
funding for these programs is limited, their ability to pro-
vide LTC is also limited. Some states use "state-only" funds
to support home and community-based LTC.
Policy Context for Home Care
Public policy interest in home care evolved because of
the financial burden to federal and state governments of
Medicaid spending for nursing home care, the impoverish-
ing consequences of use of nursing home care by disabled
elderly persons, and the preference by elderly persons for
home care. Some analysts believe that expanded home- and
community-based LTC could be a lower cost alternative to
nursing home care, especially for post-acute-care problems
(e.g., Stewart, Vandenbroek, Pearson, & Horowitz, 1999).
Research and demonstration projects conducted to test
community-based LTC as a substitute for nursing home
care have had mixed findings. Research in the 1980s gener-
ally found that home-based care did not significantly reduce
nursing home use (Kemper, Applebaum, & Harrigan, 1987).
Recent research suggests, however, that states have saved
money using home- and community-based LTC (Alecxih,
Lutzky, & Corea, 1996; U.S. General Accounting Office,
1994). Research also found that expanded community-based
care improved the quality of life of disabled older persons,
as well as of family caregivers. Some studies also reported
significant improvements in the health and functioning (Stew-
art et al., 1999) and social interaction (Kemper et al., 1987)
of older persons. Medicare home health care costs have in-
creased rapidly from 1989 to 1996. The 1982­1994 NLTCS
showed large declines in the rates of nursing home use
(Manton, Corder, & Stallard, 1997). The rate of growth of
Medicare home health costs was addressed in the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997.
Policy makers have been slow to embrace home care be-
cause of a fear of rapid expenditure growth (Wiener & Han-
ley, 1992). Because of the popularity of home-based LTC,
there has been concern about "woodwork effects" (i.e., in-
duced demand) if such services were made available. The
overriding issue, as yet unresolved, is whether the public or
private sectors, or a combination, should be financing LTC.
Different positions have been taken on who should provide
financing. Some proposals would establish a new social in-
surance program for LTC or include LTC in a national
health insurance program. Others would provide tax incen-
tives for the purchase of private LTC insurance. Other pro-
posals include new public funding for care but do not cover
all disabled people or all expenses.
As strategies for reforming the financing and provision of
LTC evolve, data on the disabled population and its use of
LTC will be helpful in informing policy makers about the
beneficiaries of various reform options. In this article we
present data on a subset of all persons requiring LTC: dis-
abled older community residents.
METHODS
We used data from the NLTCS, which were designed to
measure the prevalence of chronic disability and institution-
alization in the U.S. elderly, Medicare-enrolled population,
and changes experienced by those individuals (Manton et
al., 1997). We used data from the 1982, 1989, and 1994 sur-
veys. The three surveys used the same survey methodology
and instruments (Manton et al., 1997). Data were drawn
from lists of Medicare-eligible persons aged 65 and older
for 173 primary sampling units (PSUs). Because of the two-
stage sample design, only persons with chronic disability
were given detailed community interviews. To assume that
all persons aged 65 and older are represented in each year,
we gathered an age-in sample of 5,000 persons who passed
age 65 between survey data. In 1994 samples of healthy per-
sons and persons aged 95 and older were also drawn. Com-
parisons could be made between years to determine trends
in the use of home care services between 1982 and 1994.
The detailed community interviews in 1982, 1989, and
1994 elicited information on persons identified as chroni-
cally disabled (i.e., having a disability that lasted, or was ex-
pected to last, at least 90 days) according to 9 ADL or 11
IADL questions. Of relevance for policy initiatives, the
NLTCS collected data on the five "core" ADLs--bathing,
dressing, transferring, toileting, and eating. A study by
Wiener and Hanley (1992) suggested that ADLs can be rel-
atively well measured in a variety of national surveys.
Another set of questions in each NLTCS referred to care-
givers of disabled elderly persons. Data collected included
the relation of the caregiver to the disabled person, whether
the caregiver was paid, sources of payment if the caregiver
was paid, and how much the disabled person paid out of
pocket. The 1989 and 1994 NLTCS elicited data on how
many hours of care disabled persons received in the preced-
ing week from caregivers. Comparable data were not avail-
able from the 1982 NLTCS.
In addition to data on disability levels and caregiver pro-
files, information about prior use of health care, income, liv-
ing arrangements, and demographic characteristics was col-
lected in the NLTCS. These data are useful in estimating
how disabled subgroups' use of home-based LTC differed.
FINDINGS
We first describe the population of disabled elderly per-
sons, their disability status, and their informal and paid
caregivers. Second, we describe disabled elderly persons
CHANGES IN HOME CARE USE S247
who received paid home care and sources of payment.
Third, we describe persons paying home-based services out
of pocket, the amounts paid, and the relation between char-
acteristics of those persons and out-of-pocket payments.
Disabled Elderly Persons
The numbers of elderly persons in 1982, 1989, and 1994
residing in institutions and in the community, according to
their disability level, are shown in Table 1. The number of
elderly persons in the United States increased from 27 mil-
lion to 33 million between 1982 and 1994. In each of the
three years, 16­18% of the total elderly population was dis-
abled and residing in the community; 5­6% resided in insti-
tutions. The number of disabled elderly community resi-
dents increased from 4.8 million to 5.3 million between
1982 and 1989 and decreased slightly between 1989 and
1994. Despite the aging of the population aged 65 and older,
the institutional population increased little between 1989
and 1994 (Manton et al., 1997).
Because the number of elderly persons increased steadily, the
decline, between 1989 and 1994, in the number of community-
resident disabled elderly persons has to be due to a declining
disability rate (Manton et al., 1997). Between 1982 and
1989 and between 1989 and 1994, the proportion of the elderly
population disabled and residing in the community or in in-
stitutions declined. The decline of the elderly disabled popu-
lation estimated from the 1982­1994 NLTCS is consistent with
estimates from other surveys, for example, Crimmins, Saito,
and Reynolds (1997), the Survey of Income and Program
Participation (SIPP; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1991),
Freedman and Martin (1998), and the Medicare Current
Beneficiary Survey (MCBS; Adler, 1994). All of these surveys
covered years up to 1993 or 1994 except for the MCBS,
which covered from 1991 to 1996. Table 1 shows declining
rates in most ADL categories between 1989 and 1994.
A shift toward paid caregivers.--To analyze trends in
types of caregivers assisting disabled elderly people between
1982 and 1994, we classified caregivers as paid helpers, in-
formal helpers, and both paid and informal helpers. Table 2
contains data on disabled persons recorded by the NLTCS as
having caregivers in the reference weeks of the 1982, 1989, and
1994 surveys (90% of the community disabled elderly persons).
From 1982 to 1994, most persons used only unpaid help-
ers, although the proportion who relied on informal helpers
only declined from 74% to 64%. By 1994, a third of dis-
abled persons used paid care, either alone or in combination
with informal care.
The proportion of persons who used both paid and infor-
mal helpers increased with ADL dependency. There were
decreases, with increasing ADL dependency, in the propor-
tions of persons using only paid or only informal care. That
is, the more severely disabled a person was, the less likely
either informal or paid care, by itself, could meet the needs
of that person. In 1994, 28% of disabled elderly persons had
both informal and paid assistance, and 55% of persons with
five ADLs received combined assistance.
The data clearly indicate that paid care increased between
1982 and 1994 for disabled elderly persons receiving home-
based LTC. The increase is due to many factors, such as
higher incomes, worse health, and less availability of infor-
mal caregivers. Policy changes in publicly financed home
services under Medicaid and Medicare (e.g., expansion of
home- and community-based care services under Medicaid
and liberalization of coverage requirements under Medi-
care's home health benefit) could account for increases in
paid care between 1982 and 1994. Through the 1980s, Med-
icaid expenditures for community-based care increased dra-
matically. For example, between 1984 and 1990, real spend-
ing grew at an annual rate of 24.6%. Such increases slowed
in the early 1990s, but expenditure growth still remained
high, averaging about 15% per year (Coughlin et al., 1994).
Similarly, Medicare home health care expenditures in-
creased rapidly between 1990 and 1996, averaging approxi-
mately 25% per year. The growth in Medicare home health
care expenditures was due, in large part, to liberalization in

court ruling (Scanlon, 1997).
Helper hours increased with ADL dependency.--We ex-
amined data from the 1989 and 1994 NLTCS on the hours of
helper assistance in the preceding week received by disabled
persons; comparable data was not available in the 1982
NLTCS. Table 3 presents the distribution of disabled persons by
number of helper hours received during the week and summary
measures of helper hours in terms of the average and median
(50th percentile) for each ADL category. None indicates no
help was provided during the reference week.
Among all disabled elderly community residents, more
than half (54% in 1989 and 58% in 1994) received 1­24 h
of assistance in a week. A total of 14% in 1989 and 10% in
1994 received more than 57 h in a week; that is, 8 h per day,
every day of the week. The number of helper hours received
was related to ADL dependency. In 1994, two thirds of per-
sons with only IADL dependencies received fewer than 25 h
of help in a week, whereas only one fifth of persons with
five ADL dependencies received that amount of help.
Nearly half of persons with five ADLs (44%) received more
than 57 h of help in a week.
In 1989, persons with three ADLs received an average of
35 h of assistance in a week. Those with five ADLs aver-
aged 83 h. In contrast, persons with only IADL dependen-
cies received only 14 h of assistance in a week, and half of
them received fewer than 8 h. One study found Medicaid
home care recipients with three or more ADLs received ap-
proximately the same total hours of care regardless of the
amount of informal family contributions--in 1995, an aver-
age of 65 h per week (Hokenstad, Ramirez, Haslanger, &
Finneran, 1998). Between 1989 and 1994, the means and
medians decreased, particularly for persons with high levels
of ADL dependency. The reasons for this decrease are not
clear, but declines in the proportion of people with unpaid
caregivers could be one cause, if unpaid caregivers provided
more hours of assistance, on average, than did paid caregivers.
Sources of Paid Care
The proportion of disabled elderly persons who received
help from paid caregivers increased, on average, from one
quarter in 1982 to more than one third in 1994.
Increased participation by most payment sources.--
Information on how frequently each payment source was
mentioned by disabled persons with paid helpers in 1982,
1989, and 1994 is provided in Table 4 for specific types of
help (e.g., nursing and ADL assistance). For any type of
home care assistance, the most common source of payment
was the disabled person; 57% of persons with paid care in
1994 helped pay for that care. Table 4 also shows that dis-
abled persons' participation in paying for their own care in-
creased between 1982 and 1989 for each type of assistance.
The greatest increase was for ADL help (45% to 53%). Be-
tween 1989 and 1994, however, levels of payment by dis-
abled persons decreased slightly for ADL and IADL helpers
but increased from 36% to 44% for nursing helpers.
The proportion of disabled persons who received care
paid by Medicare or Medicaid increased between 1982 and
1989. Medicare was most frequently mentioned as a source
of payment for nursing helpers; 39% in 1982 and 45% in
1989. For any type of care, Medicare's role increased from
16% in 1982 to 20.9% in 1989. Medicaid as a payer for
nursing services increased from 16% in 1982 to 24% in
1989; Medicaid as a payer for IADL services increased
from 9% in 1982 to 12% in 1989.
Between 1989 and 1994, the proportion of disabled per-
sons receiving care paid for by Medicare continued to in-
crease, but the proportion receiving care paid for by Medi-
caid decreased. Medicare coverage for nursing helpers
leveled off during this period, but there was a large increase
in Medicare coverage for ADL and IADL helpers. This is
consistent with the changes seen in Medicare home health
care use, that is, there have been more visits per person and
more visits by aides who perform ADL and IADL services.
In 1994 the proportion of disabled persons receiving Medi-
caid assistance for any helper fell to 8.9%--slightly below
the 1982 level of 9%. The largest reduction was in paying
for nursing helpers, from 24% in 1989 to 10% in 1994.
Other sources were proportionally less often used to pay
for home care in 1989 than in 1982, although the decline in
the participation rate of this source was greatest in the case

CHANGES IN HOME CARE USE S249
of ADL and IADL assistance, as opposed to nursing care.
From 1989 to 1994, the use of other sources increased for
ADL and IADL helpers and decreased slightly for nursing
helpers. We included, in other sources, cases in which paid
care was indicated but no source was mentioned. The pay-
ment sources most likely not known by the disabled elderly
persons receiving paid care were public programs, such as
SSBG or Older Americans Act grants. Table 4 shows that
the role of private insurance was small and virtually un-
changed between 1982 and 1994.
Trend shifts toward reliance on program sources.-- We
combined payment sources in Table 5 to differentiate per-
sonal, out-of-pocket sources (i.e., disabled person, family,
and friends) and program payers (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid,
private insurance, and other). Between 1982 and 1989, the
proportion of persons with only personal sources increased,
on average, from 44% to 51%, whereas those with only pro-
gram payment sources decreased from 44% to 36%. Between
1989 and 1994, the trend reversed, with higher proportions of
persons using only program payment sources and lower pro-
portions using only personal sources. The proportion of per-
sons using both personal and program sources of payment be-
tween 1982 and 1994 increased slightly, from 11% to 14%.
In 1982, 1989, and 1994, the proportion of persons with
only personal sources decreased as ADL dependencies in-
creased. The declining role of personal sources with in-
creasing ADL dependency was offset by higher proportions
of persons using program payers, alone or in combination
with personal funds. This is consistent with some third-
party payers' (e.g., Medicaid) having criteria that trigger
benefits at high levels of disability.
Paid helper hours.--Table 6 presents the number of
paid worker hours in a week received by persons with such
helpers in 1989 and 1994 with the number of hours paid by
personal out-of-pocket and program sources. On average,
persons with any paid helpers used 15.2 h of paid help in a

week in 1989 and 12.6 h in 1994. Among disabled persons
who had only personal sources of paid help, the average was
13.8 h in 1989 and 13.1 h in 1994. Among persons with
only program-related sources of payment, the number of
hours declined, on average, from 14.1 h in 1989 to 9.7 h in
1994. People who received paid help financed by both per-
sonal and program sources had the highest number of hours
of help, but the average declined from 24.0 h in 1989 to 19.5 h
in 1994.
The number of hours of paid help increased with ADL
level, regardless of source of payment, in both 1989 and
1994. Among persons who used only personal sources, ADL-
specific paid helper hours increased with ADL levels and
were similar for 1989 and 1994. In both 1989 and 1994, the
number of hours of paid help for persons with only program-
financed care leveled off at three ADLs. This may reflect
various factors, such as the possibility that persons with
only program-paid help may have had more informal care or
were healthier in ways not measured by ADLs. The lower
paid helper hours received by persons with only program
sources could also reflect limits in helper hours of coverage
prescribed by programs.
Overall, the trend between 1989 and 1994 was toward
fewer paid hours per week, regardless of ADL levels. Re-
ductions in paid hours were most dramatic in only program
sources and the combination of personal and program
sources. This is consistent with shifts in sources of program-
sponsored payment to Medicare, with its skilled care re-
quirements, from Medicaid and other program sources ori-
ented toward extended durations of home care.
In sum, disabled persons with lower levels of ADL or
IADL dependencies paid for home care themselves. With
increasing dependency, other sources--Medicare, Medi-
caid, or insurance--played a more important role, either as
the sole source or combined with personal sources. This was
observed for 1982 and 1989. The period through 1994 sug-
gests a different trend. Medicare use continued to rise; Med-
icaid coverage decreased.
Out-of-Pocket Payments by Disabled Elderly Persons
Although the 1982, 1989, and 1994 NLTCS measured
changes in payment sources, survey data were not available
on the payments from each source. Data were collected in
the NLTCS only on the payments made by disabled persons
for home-based LTC. Because this information was not pro-
vided by all respondents, the data may not represent all such
payments. From the 1989 NLTCS, 80% of sample persons
with out-of-pocket payments provided a dollar amount.
Nevertheless, the data provide insight on the distribution of
out-of-pocket payments made by disabled persons.

Out-of-pocket payments and ADL status.--Table 7 pre-
sents data on out-of-pocket payments made by disabled per-
sons. The top panel shows that an average of $259 (adjusted
for Consumer Price Index in 1994) was spent in a month by
all persons with out-of-pocket expenses in 1982. As ex-
pected, out-of-pocket payments increased with ADL depen-
dency, from $128 for persons with IADL or one ADL de-
pendency to $544 for persons with three or more ADLs.
Table 7 also presents the payment at selected percentile levels
for disability groups. For example, half of the persons with
three or more ADLs paid $184 or more in a month (50th
percentile), whereas 10% paid $1,227 or more in a month
(90th percentile).
Data are also presented in Table 7 for 1989 and 1994. The
average out-of-pocket payment was $257 in 1989 and $250
in 1994. For persons with only IADL or one ADL depen-
dency, the average out-of-pocket payment was $100 in 1989
and $110 in 1994; in contrast, persons with three or more
ADLs spent, on average, $546 in 1989 and $578 in 1994 in
a month. As with 1982, the distribution of out-of-pocket
spending was skewed. In 1989, half of persons with three or
more ADLs spent $142 or less in a month, but 10% spent
more than $1,425 in a month.
Table 7 suggests that (a) virtually no change occurred in
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by persons with little ADL
dependency (i.e., IADL or one ADL) and (b) among per-
sons with high levels of ADL dependency, some increase in
out-of-pocket expenses occurred among those spending the
most. For example, persons with three or more ADLs who
paid the most out of pocket (i.e., the 90th percentile level)
paid more in 1994 than in 1989 ($1,800 vs $1,425).
Because the NLTCS elicited out-of-pocket expenses for a
reference month, data in Table 7 must be annualized. Thus,
persons with any out-of-pocket expenses would have spent
$3,000 a year, and persons with three or more ADLs would
have spent $6,900 for home care.
Out-of-pocket payments and personal characteristics.--
Table 8 presents out-of-pocket payments in 1989 and 1994
for subgroups of the disabled elderly persons by personal
characteristics expected to be associated with higher than
average expenses for out-of-pocket home-based care. Per-
sons with out-of-pocket payments were sorted into three
ADL categories. A review of the group with three or more
ADLs shows, compared with the overall 1994 average of
$576 of out-of-pocket expenses in a month, persons aged 75
and older spent $631 a month. Unmarried individuals spent
$756. This is consistent with such persons not having infor-
mal assistance from a spouse, who would generally be an
important caregiver. For a similar reason, persons living
alone had higher out-of-pocket expenses than the average
disabled person with three or more ADLs.
Persons who were incontinent had the highest average
monthly out-of-pocket expense in both years for all ADL
levels, showing that paid care was important in the home
management of incontinent persons. Although persons with
hospital stays in the past year had higher out-of-pocket ex-
penses than the average, persons with a prior nursing home
stay had lower expenses than those without prior nursing
home stays. One might expect use of nursing home care to
be associated with worse health beyond that controlled for
by ADL level. On the other hand, persons with prior nursing
home stays might have received more home care from other
sources, such as Medicare or Medicaid, offsetting the need
for out-of-pocket payments. Because individuals currently in
the community with a prior nursing home stay were likely to
have used those facilities for short-term, medically related
problems, subsequent home care use was also likely to be re-

lated to such problems and thus have been covered by Medicare
or Medicaid. For example, about 15% of Medicare skilled
nursing facility patients subsequently receive Medicare home
health services (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission,
1998). Finally, urban residency was associated with higher
out-of-pocket payments, because of higher prices.
DISCUSSION
The projected growth of the U.S. elderly and oldest-old pop-
ulations when baby boom cohorts reach older ages foreshadows
increasing LTC demand. Our finding, and its replication in
other surveys, that disability rates among elderly persons de-
clined in recent years suggests that future LTC demand may be
much less than it would be otherwise. It will be important, how-
ever, to closely monitor future changes in disability prevalence.
Along with recent declines in disability rates, we identi-
fied recent changes in the sources and amounts of home care
received by the disabled elderly population. Such patterns are
important because they indicate how use of currently available
public and private resources has been changing. Maintaining a
disabled elderly person in his or her own home or other non-
institutional setting often requires a combination of payer
sources to meet costs, in addition to the predominant presence
of informal family caregiving. Focusing on 1989 and 1994,
we identified four trends.
The proportion of disabled elderly persons who relied on
only paid or only informal helpers declined between 1989
and 1994. The proportion of those using both sources in-
creased. Increases in the proportion of people relying on
both sources of care were large among disabled persons
with the highest levels of ADL dependencies (i.e., five
ADLs). Changes in family demographics, increasing oppor-
tunity costs of informal caregivers, and increasingly more
complex clinical profiles of disabled elderly persons in the
community might explain this trend. For example, competing
needs of informal caregivers, who tend to be women, and
the increasing role of women in the economic workplace
may account for some of the increase in reliance on combined
use of both informal and paid caregivers. Consistent with
this notion, a study of New York City Medicaid home care
users found the vast majority of family caregivers are female
and children of the home care recipients. Approximately
40% are employed full time (Hokenstad et al., 1998).
Despite the increased use of paid sources, our analysis did not
indicate a diminished role of informal caregivers. Other studies
have indicated that informal care continues to be an important
source of care, even for people eligible for program services.
For example, individuals with families who contribute to their
care received about 40% of their total assistance (Medicaid
home care plus family care) from family members.
Second, between 1989 and 1994 Medicare home care
coverage increased, and Medicaid coverage declined. Medicare
coverage of nursing helpers leveled off, but Medicare coverage
for ADL and IADL helpers increased. This is consistent
with Medicare home health use changes--more visits per
person and more visits by aides who perform ADL or IADL
services. It is also consistent with the rapid expansion in
Medicare home health spending after 1989 that resulted from a
liberalization of coverage guidelines (Scanlon, 1997).
Coverage by Medicaid might have declined during this
period because of states' increased interest in maximizing
Medicare financing for services that might otherwise have
been paid by Medicaid. Several studies have found that
Medicare and Medicaid expenditures were inversely related
(Cohen & Tumlinson, 1997; Kenney, Rajan & Soscia,
1998). The 1997 Balanced Budget Act contained provisions
intended to reduce Medicare home health spending. As the
provisions take effect in coming years, it will be important
to monitor the extent to which Medicaid responds to Medi-
care reductions, as well as to determine if the 1997 Bal-
anced Budget Act provisions result in increased burdens for
disabled elderly persons and their families.
Third, the number of hours of home care per week, either in
terms of combined paid and informal care or of only paid care,
declined between 1989 and 1994. This applied to all persons
regardless of their ADL or IADL dependency. Although we do
not have a clear explanation for this trend, one possibility might
be the increasing availability and use of technical and mechani-
cal aides, such as personal emergency response systems, mi-
crowave ovens, and grab bars. Reductions in paid helper hours
per week might have been due to the shift in reliance on fi-
nancing from Medicaid, which is more LTC oriented, to Medi-
care, which limits coverage to conditions that require skilled
care or supervision (e.g., Stewart et al., 1999).
Fourth, only small changes in out-of-pocket payments were
observed, with the possible exception of the most disabled

CHANGES IN HOME CARE USE S253
persons and those at the high end of the spending distribution,
where out-of-pocket costs increased between 1989 and 1994.
Despite the growth of Medicare home care, about 20% of the
disabled elderly persons spent money out of pocket for home-
based care to compensate for ADL and IADL dependencies.
In 1994, for example, persons with three or more ADLs
paid $576 a month. Persons with the highest out-of-pocket
payments tended not only to have the most disability, but
also to have other characteristics that made them vulnerable.
Persons with three or more ADLs who lived alone or had
been hospitalized in the preceding 12 months had higher
than average out-of-pocket payments for home care.
In sum, in our descriptive analysis of trends in home care
use between 1982 and 1994 we found changes in sources
and amounts of care. Although the possibility or extent of
substitution between sources was beyond the scope of our
analysis, the findings do suggest that coverage by different
sources is fluid and changes can occur in relatively short periods
of time. These results further suggest that changes in the
policies of one program could impact significantly the im-
portance of that program (e.g., Medicare) as well as those of
other funding sources (e.g., Medicaid). On the other hand, our
findings do provide continuing support to the importance of
focusing home care support on the most severely disabled
elderly persons. They are the most likely to use paid services,
to use the most hours of paid care, and to pay the most money
out of pocket for such care. The most severely disabled elderly
persons and their families are also most likely to be nega-
tively impacted by contractions in publicly supported home
care, as envisioned in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act pro-
visions to constrain Medicare spending for home health.
In conclusion, our findings indicate the continuing impor-
tance of home care services for disabled older persons. As
the number and proportion of older Americans increase in
the coming decades, policy discussions addressing expan-
sion of publicly financed home care services are also likely
to increase. The way in which home care services will be
expanded and the magnitude of potential expansions will re-
flect philosophical, political, and budgetary considerations.
Given the continuing concern that the popularity of home
care services will induce "woodwork effects," any proposed
expansion in services will likely be accompanied by rules
constraining eligibility, coverage, and reimbursements. In
this regard, current policies governing Medicaid's home
care services and ongoing debate on the management of
Medicare's home health benefit will provide important
guidance for those designing future program features.
