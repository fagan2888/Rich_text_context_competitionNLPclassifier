Abstract
Background: The likely corresponding increase in prevalence of chronic disease will be a major challenge for the health care
system. Few nationwide epidemiological studies include a large enough sample of older adults to provide estimates of
chronic conditions in the older adult population. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of eight common chronic
health conditions and examine socioeconomic inequalities in the diseases among older adults in China.
Method: Data are from SAGE-China Wave 1, including 13,157 people aged 50-plus years. Respondents were asked if they
had been diagnosed with any of the following chronic medical conditions: angina, arthritis, asthma, stroke, diabetes,
depression, chronic lung disease and hypertension. A set of validated symptom-based questions and related diagnostic
algorithms were also used to estimate disease prevalence for angina, arthritis, asthma and depression. Multivariate logistic
regression was performed to examine the probability of developing chronic conditions in relation to sociodemographic
variables such as gender, age, urban/rural setting and household wealth level.
Results: Fifty percent of respondents reported having one of the selected chronic conditions, 18.9% two conditions, 5.8%
three conditions, and 1.4% reported having four or more chronic conditions. Self-reported prevalence was generated for
angina (8%), arthritis (22%), asthma (2%), stroke (3%), diabetes (7%), depression (0.3%), chronic lung disease (8%) and
hypertension (27%). The symptom-based prevalence of angina, arthritis, asthma and depression was 10%, 20%, 4% and 2%,
respectively.
Conclusion: This study provides the best available prevalence estimates for major chronic health conditions among older
Chinese adults. Findings from this study indicated that major chronic conditions were common, so prevention and early
intervention targeting adults aged 50 years and older should be prioritized.

Introduction
China's population is ageing rapidly, by the end of 2010, the
proportion of Chinese aged 60 years and over had reached 13.3%
of the total population (Chinese sixth census, 2010). According to
demographic forecasts, this proportion is expected to rise to 30
percent by 2030. The absolute numbers are estimated to increase
from 128 million in 2000 to 431 million in 2050 [1]. As people
age, the risk of chronic conditions increases, such as diabetes, heart
disease, cancer and arthritis, with china's ageing estimated to
increase NCD burden by 40% by 2030. Chronic diseases are now
among the most common and costly health problems worldwide
including China [2], especially among the older population. An
estimated 66% of the total Chinese health burden is expected to be
in older Chinese adults by 2030 [3]. Given the high rates of
modifiable risk factors contributing to the increasing prevalence of
chronic disease, more current and detailed information on the
epidemiology of chronic conditions, especially among the rapidly
growing population of older adults, is urgently needed to
anticipate any major challenges for the health care system.
Compared with higher income countries, few nationally
representative epidemiological studies with a large sample of older
adults are available in lower income countries, in particular, the
prevalence of chronic conditions in China. Although several
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 9 | e74176
previous large-scale nationally representative studies have reported
the prevalence of some chronic conditions, such as CNNHS
(China National Nutrition and Health Survey) and Chronic
Disease Risk Factor Surveillance in China [4,5], these studies are
not designed specifically for older adults and lack comparability
due to differences in the socioeconomic indicators, age groups and
the definition of diseases.
The Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) China
Wave 1 is a cross-sectional population-based study designed to
provide high quality health and well-being data among the older
adult population in China. To our knowledge, this was the first
nationwide population-based older adults' health and well-being
survey in China. This study uses SAGE-China Wave 1 data to
estimate the prevalence of eight common chronic health
conditions, examine socioeconomic inequalities in the diseases,
and provide information about epidemiologic aspects of chronic
conditions among older adults in China.
Materials and Methods
Study Population and Design
The World Health Organization's SAGE is a longitudinal study
of ageing and older adults health in six low- and middle-income
countries (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russian Federation and
South Africa) [6]. SAGE-China Wave 1 provides the baseline
round of data for a national sample of respondents aged 50-plus. A
probability sampling design and a five-stage cluster sampling
strategy were used. First, eight provinces/municipalies (Guan-
dong, Hubei, Jilin, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanghai, Yunnan, and
Zhejiang) were selected from a total of 31 provinces/municipalities
in China, according to its geographic area and social economic
level (Figure 1). Second, one county from rural DSPs (national
Death Surveillance Points) and one district from urban DSPs in
each province were selected. In total, eight provinces and 16 strata
were selected in SAGE-China. The study sample covers a total of
64 principle sample units (PSU) (two urban and two rural
townships/communities from each county/district), and 127
secondary sample units (SSU) (2 Villages/enumeration areas
(EAs) per township/community) and 254 tertiary sample units
(TSU) (2 residential blocks per Village/EA). SAGE-China Wave 1
interviews were completed in 2010, and consists of 1,636
individual respondents aged 18­49 years and 13,177 respondents
aged 50-plus years. In this study, the data analysis is restricted to
the Chinese adult population aged 50-plus. The response rates for
the individual questionnaire was above 98 percent, for a final total
sample size of 13,157 for this analysis.
Chronic Conditions
Information on chronic conditions was based on self-reports.
Respondents were asked if they had been diagnosed with any of
the following chronic medical conditions: angina, arthritis, asthma,
stroke, diabetes, depression, chronic lung disease and hyperten-
sion. The question format used was, ``Have you ever been
diagnosed with/told by a health care professional you have... ?''
for each health condition.
In an effort to improve prevalence estimates based on self-
report, a set of validated symptom-based questions and related
diagnostic algorithms were also used to estimate disease prevalence
estimates for angina, arthritis, asthma and depression [7]. In
addition, blood pressure was measured three times, at intervals of
one minute, to estimate the prevalence of hypertension. An
average of the latter two measurements was used as the final blood
pressure. The diagnostic criteria and classification of hypertension
were based on the Chinese Guidelines on Prevention and Control
of Hypertension [8] and the Sixth Joint National Committee on
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood
Pressure guidelines [9]. The definition of hypertension is systolic
blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mmHg and/or
diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg and/or
self-reported treatment of hypertension with antihypertensive
medication in the last two weeks.
Sociodemographic Variables
Socio-demographic variables include age, gender, education,
rural/urban residence and income quintiles. For analysis purposes,
age is grouped into four categories: 50 to 59 years; 60 to 69 years;
70 to 79 years; and 80-plus years. Education levels were mapped
to an international standard and categorized into six groups for
analysis [10]. The income quintiles are based on possession of a set
of assets and a number of dwelling characteristics [11]. The
variable takes on the values Q1 to Q5 with Q1 being the quintile
with the poorest households and Q5 the quintile with the richest
households.
Statistical Methods
All analyses were carried out using normalized weights of each
individual to compensate for undercoverage, which was based on
selection probability, nonresponse, and post-stratification adjust-
ments. These weights are used to calculate self-reported and
symptom-based reporting prevalence of chronic conditions.
STATA SE version 9 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX) was used
in the analyses to calculate prevalence estimates, standard errors,
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic regression
was performed to examine the relationship between chronic
conditions and socio-demographics such as sex, age, urban/rural
setting and household wealth. Odds ratios are reported with 95%
confidence intervals and a two-side p-value of 0.05 used as the cut-
off for statistical significance.
Ethics Statement
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethical
review committee of Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention, to ensure the rights and the welfare of the subject are
adequately protected; the potential risks are outweighed by
potential benefits. Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants.
Results
Sample characteristics were presented in Table 1. From the
13,157 respondents aged 50 -plus years in the whole sample, 6,150
(48.1%) were men and 6,964(51.9%) were women. The overall
mean age of was 62.6 years (SD 0.3). The majority of the
respondents were between 50 and 59 years old (44.9%), nearly half
of all respondents (47.3%) lived in a rural area. Fifty-eight percent
had completed primary school or beyond.
The self-reported prevalence of the eight major chronic
conditions was estimated for the older population (See Table 2).
These conditions were commonly reported among respondents,
especially among the oldest­old (aged 80-plus years), and varied by
condition. Hypertension and arthritis were most commonly
reported, with a prevalence of 26.8% and 22.0% respectively,
whereas asthma and depression were least common in both sexes,
with a prevalence of 2.0% and 0.3%, respectively. Besides self-
reported prevalence, symptom-reported prevalence was also
examined for angina, arthritis, asthma and depression. Self-
reported prevalence of arthritis was close to the symptom-based
reporting prevalence (22% vs. 20.4%), whereas the symptom-

based reporting prevalence was higher than the self-reported rates
for angina (10.0% vs. 7.9%), asthma (3.9% vs. 2.0%) and
depression (2.0% vs. 0.3%). The prevalence of hypertension based
on measurements, was 59.7%, over two times higher than the self-
reported rate (Figure 2).
As shown in Table 3, comorbid conditions were also common.
Based on self-report data, 49.8% of respondents reported one of
the selected chronic conditions, 18.9% reported having two
conditions, 5.8% reported having three conditions, and 1.4%
reported having four or more conditions. Older age, female and
urban residence were variables that increased the likelihood of
having chronic conditions (Figure 3).
Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that the
prevalence of self-reported chronic conditions differed significantly
by sociodemographic variables. Respondents aged 70­79 were
more likely to report any chronic condition than those in other age
groups. Men were more likely than women to have a stroke,
chronic lung disease and asthma. Wealthier respondents were
more likely to report diabetes and hypertension. All the selected
chronic conditions were more common among urban dwellers,
especially diabetes and depression (see Table 4).
Discussion
SAGE-China Wave 1 is a cross-sectional study which is also
part of the multi-country longitudinal WHO SAGE study. In this
study, the data analysis is restricted to the Chinese adult
population aged 50 years and over. Our study provides the first
overview of the magnitude of major chronic conditions based on a
nationwide sample of Chinese older adults using self-reported and
validated symptom-based reporting methods. Despite several local
or national level studies, that have already reported the prevalence
rates of one or more chronic diseases in China [4,12,13,14],
compared with these studies, the present study has a number of
strengths: 1) SAGE China is based on a national probability
sample, which can be generalized to Chinese older adults; 2)
Validated and standardized questionnaires based on WHO's
World Health Survey to improve cross-national comparability;
and, 3) Validated symptom-reporting methods were also used to
estimate and compare prevalence rates for several chronic diseases
in an effort to improve prevalence estimates based on self-report.
However, an important limitation of SAGE is that the data for
some chronic diseases were based on self-reports, which may have
resulted in recall bias. Self-reported prevalence also may be
affected by respondents' knowledge, their willingness to report the
condition, and frequency of contact with a physician.

Chronic Conditions among Older Chinese Adults
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 September 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 9 | e74176
Findings from SAGE-China Wave 1 show that chronic
conditions are common among Chinese older adults. Overall,
50% of Chinese aged 50 years and older reported at least one of
the eight major chronic conditions identified, increasing to 78%
for those aged 80 years and older. Compared to other available
data in China, noting the wide variation in definition of chronic
conditions, in the selected survey population, and in sample sizes,
the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions among older adults
has been reported to range from 50% to 91%. This study
generated prevalence-estimates that are generally lower.
Hypertension was most commonly reported among older
Chinese men and women, the prevalence of hypertension based
on measurement (59.7%) was more than two times higher than
self-reported prevalence (26.2%). The prevalence from measured
blood pressure was slightly higher than the findings from repeated
measurements in the 2002 China National Nutrition and Health
Survey (NNHS,2002), where 50% of men and 52% of women
aged 60 years or older, had hypertension [15]. The results from
another national survey study using repeated blood pressure
measurements (chronic disease risk factor surveillance in China,
2007), showed the overall prevalence of hypertension in Chinese
aged 60 to 69 years to be 56.9% in both sexes [16], which is
similar to the findings of our study. Our results also indicated that
less than half of those who were hypertensive were aware of their
hypertension status. Dongfeng Gu et,al. [17] also found just 46%
of those aged 65­74 with hypertension were aware of their
diagnosis. Since hypertension is a leading cause of death and risk
factor for stroke, heart disease and diabetes, action should be taken
to promote awareness of hypertension in older Chinese adults.
Arthritis is more common among adults, especially older adults
[18]. Self-reported arthritis ranked second in this study at 22%,
and was very close to the prevalence generated through symptom­
reporting method (20.4%). The most likely reason is that the
discomfort and pain associated with arthritis are more likely to
impact activities and prompt people to seek health care services, as
compared to a ``silent killer'' like hypertension. Angina was ranked
as the third most common chronic disease in our study: 7.9% by
self-report and 10% using the Rose questionnaire, a recent
household-based, community survey showed lower prevalence,
6.5% (95%CI 5.7­7.3) by doctor's diagnosis and 5.7% (5.0­6.5)
using the Rose questionnaire among Chinese 60 years or older
[13].
The diabetes rate is increasing in China and becoming a
burdensome chronic disease [19,20]. The present findings for
diabetes prevalence were slightly higher than those reported by the
2007 Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Surveillance carried out by
China CDC among 49,247 persons aged 15­69 years with an
estimated diabetes prevalence for Chinese aged 45­59 and 60­69
to be 3.0% and 5.3%, respectively [16]. Self-reported diabetes
prevalence in our study (5.7% in men and 7.5% in women) is
much lower than that reported in a previous nationally
representative study [21], which found a rate of 20.4% for people
60 years and older using a clinical definition of fasting whole blood
glucose of 6.1 mm or higher. This suggests that about half of the
respondents are unaware of their diabetic status. Glycosylated

Stroke represents the third leading cause of death and the second
leading cause of disability and dementia in the adult population
over 65 worldwide [22]. Self-reported prevalence of stroke in this
study was 3.1%. it is very close to the prevalence rate among
Chinese Singaporeans aged 50 and older in other study [23]. Also,
this present findings for the self-reported prevalence of stroke
among older population aged 60­69 (3.4%) is consistent with
another study in china that estimated the self-reported prevalence
of stroke to be 3.0% among older population aged 60­69 [16].

Depression is one of the most common mental health problems
among older adults, but notoriously difficult to assess through
health surveys in China [24,25]. So there has been little
information about depression in older Chinese adults. In this
study, the self-reported prevalence rate is only 0.3%, and
considerably higher using symptom-reporting and diagnostic
algorithm (2%), but is still much lower than among western older
populations [26,27]. A meta-analysis on depression of older people
in China also found a lower prevalence of depression in mainland
China compared to some western countries, and speculated that

Chronic Conditions among Older Chinese Adults
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 September 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 9 | e74176
the possible reasons are Chinese tradition and culture [28]. In
addition, as in many other societies, the stigma of mental health is
likely present, leading to underdiagnosis and low health care
seeking behavior.
In China, respiratory diseases are the third leading cause of
death in rural areas and the fourth leading cause of death in urban
areas [29]. In SAGE, chronic lung disease is also relatively
common among older Chinese men and women. Over 7% of
respondents aged 50 years and older reported having chronic lung
disease, consisting of 9.3% of men and 6.6% of women. The
prevalence of asthma in this study appears to be a little high,
compared to prevalence observed in the west, with a rate of 2% by
self-report and 3.9% by symptom reporting. However, this finding
is very similar to the 2007 China chronic disease and risk factor
surveillance with self-reported prevalence of 2.7% among adults
aged 53­64 years [16].
In this study, increasing age is associated with higher self-
reported prevalence of chronic conditions. It suggests that special
attention is needed for older adults in primary care services.
Urban/rural inequalities in the prevalence of these chronic
conditions were also found in this study, which is a very important
finding. All these chronic conditions are more common in urban
areas, especially diabetes, hypertension and depression. Other
studies also reported higher prevalence of self-reported chronic
conditions in urban dwellers [4,15,30]. For example, the third
Chinese National Health Service Survey (CNHSS), found that the
prevalence of self-reported physician diagnoses of chronic diseases
was lower among rural than urban residents [10]. The reasons for
the high prevalence in urban areas is probably due to (1) the
higher rates of common chronic condition risk factors among
urban residents compared to rural residents, including low levels of
physical activity, air pollution, overweight and obesity; and, (2)
persons who live in rural areas being less willing to tell interviewers
about their illness due to low education level, traditional
understanding of diseases and consuetudinary restriction.
A strong negative income gradient was found in the prevalence
of diabetes and hypertension. Even after adjusting for age, sex and
urban/rural residence. Wenying Yang et, al. also found diabetes
prevalence to be slightly higher in developed region in China as
compared to undeveloped regions. Differences in nutrition and
lifestyle may play a very important role. Yet SAGE results contrast
findings of other studies in developed counties [31,32]. For
example, Rabi, et, al. [31] found that low income is associated
with a higher prevalence of diabetes in Canada.
Findings from this study indicated that chronic conditions were
common among the older adult population in China. In view of
the large older population in China, chronic conditions are likely
to be both a health issue and also a social challenge. Prevention
and early intervention targeting older adults and urban residents
should be prioritized.
