NHANES Data Highlight the Clinical Characteristics of Those With
Poorly Controlled Hypertension
Jan N. Basile, MD;1 and Michael J. Bloch MD2
Longitudinal data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) demon-
strate that during the years 1998­2008, the prevalence
of uncontrolled hypertension has declined. However,
there is still considerable room for improvement
because in 2007­2008, 49.9% of hypertensives, repre-
senting approximately 33 million Americans, did not
have adequate blood pressure (BP) control
(<140/90 mm Hg). The largest group of patients with
poorly controlled hypertension were those who
remained untreated (52.2% in 2005­2008). The sec-
ond largest group were those who were treated with
only 1 or 2 antihypertensive medications (34.4% in
2005­2008). Apparent treatment-resistant hyper-
tension, defined as poor control despite at least 3 anti-
hypertensive medications, was the third largest group
and found in 28.0% of uncontrolled hypertensives
between 2005­2008, an increase from past evalua-
tions. These data demonstrate that the majority of
patients with uncontrolled hypertension are usually
untreated or undertreated and not necessarily resistant
to treatment. Future population-based strategies to
improve BP control needs to focus on improving
access to care and raising awareness of hypertension in
those who infrequently seek primary care. In addition,
overcoming therapeutic inertia by adding antihyperten-
sive medications and intensifying treatment appears
important if we are to further improve BP control.
STUDY METHODS
Between 1988 and 2008 a series of surveys of the US
population was undertaken by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Known as NHANES, these
surveys used stratified multistage probability sampling
on the noninstitutionalized US population who were
asked to self-report information about a number of
chronic medical conditions and health-related behav-
iors. In addition, each participant had their BP mea-
sured in standardized fashion by trained study
personnel and had basic laboratory studies performed,
including lipid panels, measurement of renal function,
and fasting blood glucose. Hypertension was defined
as a systolic BP at least 140 mm Hg, a diastolic BP at
least 90 mm Hg, or a positive response to the question
``Are you currently taking medication to lower your
BP.'' Awareness, current treatment of hypertension,
and number of medications were all self-reported on
the basis of standard queries. Control of hypertension
was defined as a systolic BP <140 mm Hg and a
diastolic BP <90 mm Hg.
Therapeutic inertia was arbitrarily defined and strat-
ified according to prespecified criteria that took into
account the level of BP control, the number of health
care provider visits in the past year, the number of
medications being taken, and the underlying cardio-
vascular risk. Because medication dose and adherence
to therapy is not captured in NHANES, the term
apparent treatment resistant hypertension (aTRH) was
used and defined as uncontrolled hypertension despite
the use of at least 3 antihypertensive medications. The
investigators focused on those with uncontrolled
hypertension and identified 3 key groups: (1) untreated
hypertensives, (2) hypertensives taking 1 or 2 medica-
tions, and (3) aTRH. The authors used standard statis-
tical tools to identify key characteristics that were
significantly associated with each group.--Egan BM,

STUDY RESULTS AND COMMENTARY
Overall, the proportion of patients with uncontrolled
hypertension declined from 72.2% in 1988­1994 to
52.5% in 2005­2008. Across all time periods, male
sex, black race, and Hispanic ethnicity were associated
with poor BP control. Uncontrolled hypertensives were
more likely to have only 0 or 1 health care visits annu-
ally, while controlled hypertensives were more likely to
have at least 4 health care visits per year. Among
patients with uncontrolled hypertension, the proportion
of uninsured patients increased over time. Additionally,
the prevalence of diabetes was higher in controlled
rather than uncontrolled patients. These data suggest
that having an identified reason to access health care,
both in terms of expanding insurance coverage and
requiring a greater frequency of contacts with a health
care provider, has an impact on improving BP control.
Focus on Untreated Hypertension
The likelihood of being treated for hypertension rose
steadily from 1988­2008, but even in 2005­2008, more
than 50% of uncontrolled patients were untreated.

were unaware of their condition. The particular design
of the NHANES, where hypertension was often defined
based on BP readings from a single study visit, may
have overestimated the incidence of hypertension and
particularly untreated hypertension. Nonetheless, even
taking this into account, it would appear that lack of
treatment (and even awareness) of hypertension is the
most common reason for poor BP control.
Among this group of untreated hypertensives, infre-
quent contact with a health care provider was a major
issue as approximately 40% reported having 0 or 1
visits to a health care provider annually. Furthermore,
many patients with hypertension lack insurance and
cannot afford the visits to a health care provider
and/or the cost of antihypertensive medications. In
addition, since hypertension is largely an asymptom-
atic condition, even people with access to affordable
health care without other medical issues that often
prompt health care screening, such as young men, may
not have their BP measured regularly.
In summary, these data suggest that changes in pub-
lic health policy and health care delivery could lead to
substantial improvements in BP control. In addition
to expanding health insurance coverage and access to
affordable medications, increased BP screenings, par-
ticularly in less traditional settings where young men
are more likely to gather (ie, work sites, barbershops,
grocery stores, pharmacies) and public health cam-
paigns focusing on the importance of BP measurement
and control may be among the most important and
cost-effective ways to improve BP control rates.
Focus on Treated Hypertensives Treated With 1 or
2 Antihypertensive Medications
The second largest group of uncontrolled hypertensives
in NHANES were those treated with only 1 or 2 medi-
cations, representing about one third of the total in
each of the NHANES examination time periods. By
definition, this group of patients has inadequately
treated hypertension. Whereas infrequent contact with
a health care provider was a frequent characteristic of
those with untreated hypertension, in this group treat-
ed with only 1 or 2 medications, 85% to 90% had at
least 2 visits annually with a provider.
These data suggest that therapeutic inertia, the fail-
ure to intensify therapy in the face of poorly con-
trolled hypertension, appears to be the primary
driving force in this group. Degree of therapeutic
inertia, as defined somewhat arbitrarily for the pur-
poses of this study, was found in more than 50% of
these patients.
The authors of this report suggest that therapeutic
inertia is not a provider-only trait, but a reflection of
the provider-patient interaction. We believe it is really
the result of the complex interactions between patient,
provider, and other components of the health care
delivery system, including health plans, formularies,
pharmacies, and governmental agencies. Multiple stud-
ies have identified that therapeutic inertia is a major
contributor to poor BP control, and awareness of the
issue to date does not appear to have led to major
improvements in control. In order to better overcome
therapeutic inertia, we need to work towards develop-
ing systems of care that appropriately align incentives
across the spectrum of health care delivery and award
quality. Overcoming therapeutic inertia (ie, intensify-
ing therapy in the setting of poorly controlled hyper-
tension) should be considered a variable in emerging
pay-for-performance models.
Focus on Apparently Treatment-Resistant
Hypertension
Although definitions vary, resistant hypertension is gen-
erally defined as uncontrolled hypertension in the set-
ting of at least 3 well-chosen, adequately dosed
medications or BP that is controlled using at least 4
medications. Since the NHANES database has only lim-
ited data regarding antihypertensive medication adher-
ence and dose, it is not possible to adequately define
the exact proportion of patients who are treatment-
resistant, hence the use of the term apparent treatment
resistant. Over time, the proportion of uncontrolled
patients with aTRH increased from 15.9% in 1988­
1994 to 28.0% in 2005­2008. In actuality, many of
these patients may have the white-coat effect or poor
adherence rather than true treatment resistance.
While it appears to be less common than untreated
or inadequately treated hypertension, aTRH remains
an important issue. Other studies have demonstrated
that these patients are at significant risk for cardiovas-
cular events and may gain substantial clinical benefit
from improved BP control. In multivariate analyses,
clinical factors associated with aTRH-apparent, treat-
ment-resistant hypertension in NHANES include infre-
quent health care visits and the presence of obesity,
chronic kidney disease, or a high Framingham risk
score. One particular issue that was highlighted in this
paper is the infrequent use of spironolactone in this
patient population.
Hopefully, the Eighth Report of the Joint National
Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and
Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 8) will pro-
vide clinicians with more comprehensive guidance on
how to better use appropriate combinations of antihy-
pertensive medications in patients with poorly
controlled hypertension. Additionally, the continued
development of novel device interventions aimed at
treatment-resistant hypertension, including barorecep-
tor modulation and renal sympathetic denervation,
may prove beneficial.
FINAL THOUGHTS
The NHANES investigators have provided us with a
relatively complete snapshot of what the population of
patients with poorly controlled hypertension look like.
It is now up to us as clinicians and policy makers to
develop the best strategies to improve BP control
based on these findings.
