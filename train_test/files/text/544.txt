Objective.To investigate the sense of smell, including sensitivity and odor identification, and characterize the
U.S. national prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in older adults, thereby facilitating further investigation of the substan-
tial risks for older adults associated with this basic sensory ability.
Method. The sense of smell was evaluated using the Olfactory Function Field Exam (OFFE), a measure designed spe-
cifically for field research, which assesses 3 components of olfaction: sensitivity to n-butanol (a standard testing odorant)
and androstadienone (AND, a key social odor produced by humans), as well as the ability to identify odors. Respondents
were randomly selected from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project Wave 2 sample to receive the OFFE
(n = 2,304), and 2,212 consented to participate.
Results. In the U.S. population aged 62­90, n-butanol detection ability was significantly worse at older ages (ordinal
logistic regression, p < .001); however, there was no difference in detection ability between genders (p = .60). AND
detection ability was also significantly worse at older ages (p = .003), but in contrast to n-butanol, women outperformed
men (p = .001). As expected, odor identification ability was worse in older people than in younger (p < .001), and women
were more accurate than men (p = .001).
Discussion.We report for the first time 3 facets of olfactory function and its association with age and gender in a
representative sample of U.S. older adults. Future analyses of these data are needed to elucidate the sense of smell's role
in physical, social, and mental health with aging.
Key Words:Aging--Androstadienone--n-Butanol--Odor identification--Olfaction.
The sense of smell is a critical sensory modality for not
only human health but also psychosocial function and
overall quality of life (Frasnelli & Hummel, 2005; Smeets
et al., 2009). Although there is a literature investigating
olfaction and age (for a recent review, see Doty & Kamath,
2014), olfactory function has never before been measured
in a nationally representative sample of older adults. Thus,
measuring olfaction is an important component of the
National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP).
These data provide the ability to estimate the prevalence of
olfactory dysfunction in the growing older adult population
of the United States and to investigate the substantial health
and social consequences for older adults associated with
this basic sensory ability.
A functioning sense of smell requires the ability to physi-
cally detect an odor. People with high odor sensitivity can
detect the presence of an odor at low concentrations of the
odor molecule, whereas those with low sensitivity require
higher concentrations. This parallels sensory frailty in
other senses, for example hearing, where a stimulus has to
be louder to be perceived, a common condition of aging.
n-Butanol is a standard odorant used to assess olfactory
sensitivity. It is a short primary alcohol found in foods, fer-
mented beverages, and numerous consumer products.
A functional sense of smell also requires the ability to
cognitively identify an odor and its associated meaning
or name. Olfactory identification is typically measured by
presenting familiar odors of common objects such as flow-
ers, foods, and household items. First, the odor must be
detected, but to correctly identify an odor requires the cog-
nitive ability to then link that odor with a word or picture.
These independent components of olfactory function do
not operate in isolation and are equally important to assess
when considering what role olfactory function plays in the
lives of older adults.
Therefore, we developed and employed the Olfactory
Function Field Exam (OFFE), a tool to measure the sense
of smell in field and survey research (Kern, Wroblewski,
Schumm,Pinto,&McClintock,inpress).TheOFFEincludes
not only a measure of odor identification previously used in
NSHAP Wave 1 (Boesveldt, Lindau, McClintock, Hummel,
& Lundström, 2011; Pinto, Schumm, Wroblewski, Kern,
S134
Olfaction Assessment
& McClintock, 2014; Schumm et al., 2009), but also the
first measure of odor detection designed for use in a survey
research study.
The sense of smell declines with age, a condition known as
presbyosmiaandisanaspectofsensoryfrailtysimilartoimpaired
hearing or vision. The factors that predict this decline are poorly
understood,however.Thoughtheinfluencesofolfactiononhealth
are too numerous to detail here (for a review, see Jones & Rog,
1998 or Seiberling & Conley, 2004), there are two critical con-
sequences to consider for older adults: nutrition and detection
of danger. The sense of smell has a large effect on dietary habits
and nutrition (Schiffman, 1997;Visvanathan & Chapman, 2009),
which are vital components of maintaining physical health. Much
of what is perceived as the flavor and enjoyment of food is actu-
ally a product of retronasal olfactory perception, in which odors
from food travel through the back of the throat into the nose dur-
ingeating.Hence,presbyosmiacanresultindecreasedenjoyment
of food and associated social behaviors, such as dining out or
sharing a meal with others (Aschenbrenner et al., 2008). A func-
tional sense of smell is also critical for detecting malodorous envi-
ronmental dangers like spoiled food or smoke (Santos, Reiter,
DiNardo, & Costanzo, 2004), as well as mercaptans, which serve
as warning signals in otherwise odorless natural gas (Cain, Rabin,
Pierce, & Haven, 1989). Indeed, olfactory deficits are linked to
increased mortality (Gopinath, Sue, Kifley, & Mitchell, 2012;
Wilson,Yu, & Bennett, 2011), although the pathways linking loss
of smell to specific causes of death remain undiscovered.
Olfactory function is tied to not only health and qual-
ity of life measures like nutrition and avoiding potential
environmental threats, but also detection of social odorants
in the form of chemical signals that may be critical to the
physiology of social interactions, and even mental health.
Social chemical signals produced by humans have asso-
ciated odors and are known to affect behavior and mood
(Havlicek, Murray, Saxton, & Roberts, 2010). Much prior
research investigating human airborne chemical signals has
also focused on the possible existence of pheromonal mod-
ulators of sexual attraction or behavior (e.g., McClintock,
2000; Bensafi, Brown, Khan, Levenson, & Sobel, 2004;
Lundström & Olsson, 2005; Savic, Berglund, Gulyas, &
Roland, 2001; Saxton, Lyndon, Little, & Roberts, 2008)
However, recent research has suggested that human chemi-
cal signals, such as the steroid androstadienone (AND),
a molecule that is found in human plasma (Brooksbank,
Wilson, & Macsweeney, 1972), sweat (Gower, Holland,
Mallet, Rennie, & Watkins, 1994; Labows, 1988), axillary
hair (Nixon, Mallet, & Gower, 1988), and semen (Kwan,
Trafford, Makin, Mallet, & Gower, 1992), may exhibit
a broader social function: tuning individuals' brains to
attend to emotionally salient information (Hummer &
McClintock, 2009). Thus, AND has broader effects on
emotional interactions than just sexuality and may con-
tinue to function in postreproductive older adults. In this
context, the ability to smell AND may be tied to its physio-
logical and behavioral affects at subliminal concentrations.
Deficits to the sense of smell have also been linked to cog-
nitive decline (Sohrabi et al., 2012), and dementia associ-
ated with several neurodegenerative disorders (Barresi et al.,
2012). Thus, an individual's sense of smell is important for
navigating not only the physical and social world but also
has important implications for mental and cognitive health.
Previous survey research investigating olfactory func-
tion has been limited to tasks of odor identification using
samples of convenience (Wysocki & Gilbert, 1989) or in
relatively homogeneous samples (Brämerson, Johansson,
Ek, Nordin, & Bende, 2004; Murphy, Cruickshanks, Klein,
Klein, & Nondahl, 2002). This limitation stems from the
fact that traditional tests of the ability to detect an odor (i.e.,
sensitivity) use standard psychophysical measures that can
take up to 20min to administer, mainly because they require
repeated trials and many odorant concentrations (Hummel,
Sekinger, Wolf, Pauli, & Kobal, 1997). Prior efforts to
streamline a sensitivity protocol using fixed dose points
(Kobal et al., 2001; Lötsch, Lange, & Hummel, 2004) are
still too difficult to administer efficiently in a survey in the
home, especially along with a large number of social, psy-
chological, and biological measures.
Since the previous methods are ill-suited for omnibus
field surveys, the majority of knowledge of human olfac-
tion is limited to laboratory and clinic based testing. Clinical
olfactory studies have demonstrated that, in addition to the
substantial social health deficits associated with olfactory
dysfunction, declining olfactory abilities are a harbinger of
cognitive deficits associated with neurodegenerative diseases
(Doty, 2012; Morgan, Nordin, & Murphy, 1995; Olofsson
et al., 2009; Sun, Raji, Maceachern, & Burke, 2012). This
suggests olfactory tests may offer a means for earlier detec-
tion of these devastating illnesses (Atanasova et al., 2008;
Devanand et al., 2010; Murphy, 2002; Tabert et al., 2007).
Because of these factors, which are important in geriat-
rics, assessment of olfactory abilities in older adults offers
not only a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of
reduced sensory abilities on the physical and social health
of the aging U.S. population, but also the role of olfaction as
a potential marker of cognitive decline and neuropathology.
Method
Respondents
Approximately two-thirds of the NSHAP Wave 2 sample
was randomly selected to receive the OFFE (n = 2,304). Of
these, 2,180 were age-eligible respondents (age 62­90 years
old) (Jaszczak et al., 2014). Fully 96% of respond-
ents (n = 2,212) consented to participate in this module
(2,094 age eligible; 990 men and 1,104 women), thus dem-
onstrating excellent cooperation rates. Table 1 summarizes
the demographics of the NSHAP Wave 2 olfaction sub-
sample. Data is publicly available (Waite, L. J., Cagney,
K., Dale, W., Huang, E., Laumann, E. O., McClintock, M.,

Olfactory Function Field Exam
Olfactory function was evaluated using commercially
available Sniffin' Sticks smell pens (Burghart Medical
Technology, Wedel, Germany). Sniffin' Sticks reliably
deliver the same concentration of n-butanol with each
presentation for at least 3 years with correct use and
proper storage (Denzer et al., 2014). The NSHAP W2
field period was 11 months long (August, 2010 to June,
2011) and used approximately 120 pen sets in the field.
A single set of pens was administered a median of 11 times
(interquartile range = 5­19). As a result, we can be con-
fidant that NSHAP's measures of olfactory function were
reliable and consistent within a single interview, across
interviewers, and across the entire field period.
Wave 2 responses were directly entered into the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) by the Field
Interviewer (FI), thereby reducing interviewer burden and
error associated with paper scoring.
The odor detection component of the OFFE required
respondents to detect ascending concentrations of two
odors: n-butanol and AND. Concentrations were presented
in an increasing fashion to reduce the risk that a weaker
concentration was made more difficult to detect when pre-
sented following a stronger concentration for a given odor
(habituation) (Doty et al., 2003). Creation of the custom
AND Sniffin' Sticks pens used here has been described pre-
viously (Lundström, Hummel, & Olsson, 2003).
Prior to each olfactory detection task, respondents were
first presented with a pen that contained the strongest odor-
ant concentration in the OFFE. This was done as a neces-
sary component of psychophysical testing (Hayes & Jinks,
2012; Hummel et al., 1997) to ensure that respondents first
knew what stimuli they would be asked to detect, before
they were actually asked to detect it. Respondents were
asked if they were able to smell the odor and told explicitly
that this is the odor they would be attempting to detect dur-
ing later testing. After presenting the practice target pen, the
FI recorded the respondent's answer in CAPI and described
the instructions for the ensuing task. Similar to psycho-
physical testing, this time served as a "washout" period to
allow the nose to recover before testing began. All respond-
ents were administered the n-butanol task regardless of
their self-reported ability to smell the n-butanol practice
target pen.
The ability to detect AND as an odor is not a product
of overall olfactory acuity (Lundström et al., 2003), and
a genetic component explains this inability to smell AND
(Keller, Zhuang, Chi, Vosshall, & Matsunami, 2007).
Therefore, any NSHAP respondent who indicated that they
could not smell the AND practice screener pen was not pre-
sented with the AND detection task to minimize frustration
and maintain cooperation on ensuing NSHAP survey tasks.
The respondent's detection abilities were determined for
each odor by presenting a series of pens, three at a time. One
pen in each triad contained the target odor while the other
two pens did not. A schematic of the administration method
is presented in Figure 1. After presenting three pens, the FI
asked the respondent, "Which of the three pens contains the
odor?" and entered the response into CAPI before going on
to the next pen triad.
The concentrations of n-butanol (see Table 2) were
selected based on prior research on n-butanol sensitivity
in this age group in which older adults were found to have
a mean threshold to n-butanol of 0.06% (Hummel, Kobal,

Olfaction Assessment
Gudziol, & Mackay-Sim, 2007). All n-butanol concen-
trations in the OFFE are stronger than 0.06% to provide
greater ability to detect olfactory dysfunction across the
spectrum in NSHAP's diverse older adult population.
Data describing AND sensitivity in population-based
samples has never, to our knowledge, been previously col-
lected. Limited threshold testing done in laboratory set-
tings has indicated that individuals may be split by their
sensitivity to AND into three groups: (a) individuals who
cannot smell the odor regardless of strength (i.e., concen-
tration), (b) individuals who are only able to smell the odor
at high concentrations, and (c) individuals who are able to
detect AND at low concentrations (Lundström et al., 2003).
AND concentrations (Table 2) were therefore selected to
identify these three groups because detection ability may be
associated with social, mental, or physical health outcomes
that NSHAP investigates.
The odor identification portion of the OFFE is an abbre-
viated, validated test (Mueller & Renner, 2006) that is
identical to the five-odor test previously used in NSHAP
Wave 1 (Boesveldt et al., 2011; Pinto et al., 2014; Schumm
et al., 2009). Respondents were asked to choose the correct
odor from a set of four word/picture options. The response
options for each pen were as follows (correct odor indicated
in italics): (a) chamomile, raspberry, rose, or cherry; (b)
smoke, glue, leather, or grass; (c) orange, blueberry, straw-
berry, or onion; (d) bread, fish, cheese, or ham; (e) chive,
peppermint, pine, or onion.
When presenting each pen, the interviewer removed the
cap and gently waved it approximately 0.5 inches below
both nostrils. Respondents were asked to breathe in nor-
mally through their nose as each pen was presented for
about 2 s. FIs wore a cotton glove during administration
of the OFFE in order to minimize the effects of any odors
associated with the interviewer (e.g., lotions, soaps, body
odors, etc.).
Respondents were encouraged by the interviewer to do
their best to give an answer, but OFFE tasks did not use
forced-choice questions and respondents were allowed
to refuse to answer or respond by indicating that they did
not know (following Mueller & Renner, 2006). Although
forced-choice paradigms are typically used in psychophysi-
cal testing, they are not feasible in an in-home survey set-
ting where demanding the respondent offer an answer may
reduce cooperation for other parts of the extensive interview.
Variable names for the identification task are consist-
ent across NSHAP waves, bluepen_*. n-Butanol and AND
variable names were altered between waves to reflect the
significant changes to the measures that occurred in Wave 2
(redpen_* to redpen2_*; greenpen_* to greenpen2_*).
Data Analysis
Each OFFE task is scored separately by adding the num-
ber of correct responses for a given task, generating three
separate scores. Those respondents who indicated they
could not smell AND in the practice screener pen were
assigned a score of 0 on the AND detection task. A response
of "Don't know" or a refusal was considered incorrect in
each of the three tasks.
Analyses used the number of odors correctly identified or
detected as the dependent variable. Ordinal logistic regres-
sion modeled its relationship with age and gender. Logistic
regression was used to test the effect of survey wave on
the ability to identify odors. Analyses were weighted using
the weights, strata, and Primary Sampling Unit indica-
tors provided with the dataset to account for differential
probabilities of selection and differential nonresponse.
Statistical analyses were conducted with Stata Version 13.1
(StataCorp. LP).

Results
Olfactory Detection
n-Butanol.--The completion rate for the n-butanol detec-
tion task among the age-eligible respondents was 99.8%
(n = 2,089). Prevalence of correctly detecting n-butanol
concentrations is depicted in Figure 2 for the overall
U.S. population aged 62­90 as well as for age and gender
subgroups. Ordinal logistic regression indicated that detec-
tion ability was significantly worse at older ages (odds ratio
[OR] = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63, 1.06 for
70­79 vs. 62­69; OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.37, 0.60 for 80­90
vs. 62­69; overall p < .001), but there were no differences
between women versus men (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.85,
1.33, p = .60). Accuracy for detecting each concentration
of n-butanol is detailed in Table 3 for the U.S. older adult
population as well as age and gender subgroups.
Androstadienone.--The completion rate for the AND task
among the age-eligible respondents was 99.6% (n = 2,086).
Prevalence of correctly detecting AND concentrations over-
all is depicted in Figure 3 for the U.S. population aged
62­90 as well as for age and gender subgroups. A total of
569 respondents (27%) explicitly reported that they could
not smell the AND practice screener pen. These respondents
were assigned a score of 0 and were not asked to complete the
remaining AND task. The ability to detect AND was worse
at older ages (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.97 for 70­79 vs.
62­69; OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.84 for 80­90 vs. 62­69;
overall p = .003), and women outperformed men (OR = 1.54,
95% CI: 1.19, 2.00, p = .001). Accuracy for detecting each
concentration ofAND is detailed in Table 4 for the U.S. older
adult population as well as age and gender subgroups.
Odor Identification
The completion rate for the odor identification task
among the age-eligible respondents was 99.7% (n = 2,088).
Prevalence of correctly identifying the odors is depicted in
Figure 4 for the U.S. population aged 62­90 as well as for
age and gender subgroups. Rose was the most difficult odor to
identify (71% correct) and peppermint the easiest (89% cor-
rect). Population accuracy for each odor is detailed in Table 5.
Ordinal logistic regression indicated that older people per-
formed more poorly than younger (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.50,
0.86 for 70­79 vs. 62­69; OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.32 for
80­90 vs. 62­69; overall p < .001), and women outperformed
men (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.18, 1.84, p = .001).
Since olfactory identification was measured in Wave 1
(Schumm et al., 2009) andWave 2, we assessed the likelihood
of correctly identifying each odor for respondents of the same
age across waves. With the exceptions of leather (OR = 1.34,
95% CI: 1.13, 1.59, p = .001) and orange (OR = 1.59, 95%
CI: 1.27, 1.97, p < .001), which were more likely to be identi-
fied correctly in Wave 2, there was no effect of survey wave
on the ability to detect the identification odors.

Discussion
Olfactory function is most commonly measured by tests of
odor identification, where women are typically more accurate.
We replicated this gender difference with the NSHAP odor
identification task. In this first large population study of olfac-
tory sensitivity, women were also more sensitive to AND, a
social odorant. In contrast, there were no gender differences
in the ability to detect n-butanol, a standard testing odorant.

Accuracy on all three tasks was worse at older ages,
however the size of the effect varied between the dif-
ferent tests. In the comparison of the oldest versus
youngest age groups, the magnitude of the age differ-
ence was largest for the identification task followed by
the n-butanol and AND tasks (OR = 0.25, 0.47, 0.68,
respectively).
Explaining these differences in olfactory function will
offer insights into the complex physiology of olfaction and
also help to reveal the mechanisms by which the sense of
smell influences health, physical function, and social inter-

Olfaction Assessment
serve a social role only in the context of reproduction in
early adulthood.
Our results support the need for testing multiple facets of
olfactory function, odor sensitivity as well as identification.
We report well-established gender differences for the odor
identification task which required respondents to detect an
odor as well as the cognitive ability to match it to word-
picture items. In contrast, for the less cognitively demanding
n-butanol detection task, we saw no such gender difference.
Thus, when using data from NSHAP, both aspects of olfac-
tory function should be considered, especially when address-
ing analytical questions where the cognitive demands of the
odor identification task may serve as a possible confound. In
the same vein, when possible, future survey research should
incorporate multiple measures of olfaction rather than rely-
ing on only one facet of this sensory modality.
Use of the OFFE in NSHAP Wave 2 is the first success-
ful evaluation of odor detection and sensitivity in a repre-
sentative survey setting. Wave 1 of NSHAP attempted to
measure respondent olfactory sensitivity by presenting
increasing odor concentrations and asking respondents
to rate the intensity of the odor on a Visual Analog Scale
(VAS) from 0 to 10 (0 = no smell at all; 10 = smells very
strong). Results were measured in centimeters (range from
0 to 10). Respondents had difficulty using both a written
and electronic VAS and the resulting data were inconsistent
and ultimately uninterpretable.
Using triads of odor pens in the Wave 2 detection pro-
tocols eliminated the difficulties that occurred in Wave
1. Instead, with the exception of the relatively few responses
of "Don't know" or refusals, Wave 2 participants could
either accurately detect an odor at a given concentration, or
they could not.
However, researchers interested in estimating the preva-
lence of olfactory abilities based on a true forced-choice
paradigm that exists elsewhere in the clinical literature for
these types of tasks should consider using a technique such
as multiple imputation to incorporate the "Don't know"
and "Refused" responses (e.g., assuming that the respond-
ent, had he or she been forced to choose, would have cho-
sen from any of the pens with equal probability) (Schafer,
1999). Researchers should use a 1/3 probability of correctly
detecting the target pen in the detection triads or 1/4 prob-
ability for correctly guessing an identification pen.
Researchers interested in using OFFE data may also wish
to include other factors known to affect olfactory function.
The NSHAP Wave 2 interview documents any severe prior
head injuries or nose surgeries. Respondents were also
asked, "Today, do you have a head cold or chest cold?" to
account for an olfactory deficit that may have been present
due to illness on the day of the interview. Analysts should
also consider incorporating data on self-reported smoking
history, current smoking habits, and use of relevant cur-
rent medications recorded as part of the NSHAP interview.
These covariates offer useful information as each may influ-
ence the sense of smell (Doty et al., 1997; Jones & Rog,
1998; Reden et al., 2006).
Conclusion
In NSHAP Wave 2, the use of the OFFE makes possi-
ble for the first time a comprehensive investigation of the
relationship between global olfactory function (detection
ability of both standard testing and social odors, as well as
the ability to identify odors) and a host of physical, social,
and mental health outcomes in a representative sample of
the older adult population of the United States. Here, we
show that olfactory function is worse for older age groups
for odor identification, as well as n-butanol and AND detec-
tion. Women outperformed men on the odor identification
and AND detection tasks, however there was no gender dif-
ference in the ability to detect n-butanol.

Key Points
·
· Sense of smell in a nationally representative sample of
older adults was measured using the OFFE.
·
· The OFFE consists of three olfactory tasks, which
measure three components of the sense of smell: (a)
n-butanol detection, (b) AND detection, and (c) odor
identification.
·
· Differential performance across tasks suggests that
each one measures a distinct aspect of the sense of
smell.
·
· The OFFE provides an accurate, straightforward
method for investigating the role of different facets of
olfactory function in a field setting.
