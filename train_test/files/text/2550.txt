Abstract
The Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS) is a nationally repre-
sentative longitudinal survey of Taiwanese middle-aged and older adults. It adds the col-
lection of biomarkers and performance assessments to the Taiwan Longitudinal Study of
Aging (TLSA), a nationally representative study of adults aged 60 and over, including the
institutionalized population. The TLSA began in 1989, with follow-ups approximately
every 3 years; younger refresher cohorts were added in 1996 and 2003. The first wave of
SEBAS, based on a sub-sample of respondents from the 1999 TLSA, was conducted in
2000. A total of 1023 respondents completed both a face-to-face home interview and,
several weeks later, a hospital-based physical examination. In addition to a 12-h
(7 pm­7 am) urine specimen collected the night before and a fasting blood specimen col-
lected during the examination, trained staff measured blood pressure, height, weight
and waist and hip circumferences. A second wave of SEBAS was conducted in 2006
using a similar protocol to SEBAS 2000, but with the addition of performance assess-
ments conducted by the interviewers at the end of the home interview. Both waves of
SEBAS also included measures of health status (physical, emotional, cognitive), health
behaviours, social relationships and exposure to stressors. The SEBAS data, which are
publicly available at [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACDA/studies/3792/version/
5], allow researchers to explore the relationships among life challenges, the social envir-
onment and health and to examine the antecedents, correlates and consequences of
change in biological measures and health.

Cohort Profile
Why was the cohort set up?
The social environment, encompassing position in social
hierarchies as well as linkages within social networks and
support systems, interacts with life challenges and stress
exposure to influence physical and mental well-being. The
Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study
(SEBAS) in Taiwan was initially developed to explore how
understanding the relationships among life challenges, the
social environment and health can be enhanced by examin-
ing biological markers of health and stress. Incorporating
biological data into large-scale social surveys not only ex-
pands the range and depth of research topics that can be
pursued, but can also enhance study findings based solely
on self-reported data (which may suffer from misreporting)
or on smaller clinical studies that are often not generaliz-
able to the larger population.1
Specific aims of the initial study included: (i) investigat-
ing the extent to which biological markers of stress and
chronic illness are related to reports of life events; (ii)
examining the extent to which biological markers help to
explain variation in health across social hierarchies and
networks; and (iii) exploring the associations among the
biological markers, data from physicians' examinations
and self-reported health status, and their links to survival.
With the addition of longitudinal data, the goals of the
project have expanded to understanding the antecedents,
correlates and consequences of levels and changes in biolo-
gical measures, health and survival.
Who is in the cohort?
SEBAS is an extension of the Taiwan Longitudinal Study
of Aging (TLSA: also called the Survey of Health and
Living Status of the Near Elderly and Elderly). Here we
give a brief summary of the survey design and protocol;
more detailed information is provided elsewhere.2 The
TLSA began in 1989 with follow-ups approximately every
3 years; younger refresher cohorts were added in 1996 and
2003. The original 1989 sample was nationally representa-
tive, including the institutionalized population, and com-
prised 4049 people aged 60 and older (see Figure 1).
A three-stage sampling design that mirrored the original
TLSA design was used to select from the respondents who
were interviewed in 1999 a national sub-sample for the
SEBAS 2000 cohort. Two visits were made to the SEBAS
respondents' homes between July and December 2000: one
to administer a face-to-face questionnaire and the second,
several weeks later, to deliver urine collection containers
and make final arrangements for a hospital examination
the following morning. As shown in Figure 1, 1497 per-
sons (92% of those eligible) were interviewed in their
home and 1023 (68% of those interviewed) participated in
the physical examination, which was generally equivalent
to an annual physical examination offered by the national
health insurance programme.
Table 1 shows that respondents participating in the
2000 hospital examination were younger, more likely to be
male, and better educated than those who did not partici-
pate. Compared with non-participants, examination par-
ticipants were also less likely to report difficulty with any
activity of daily living (ADL), which was not surprising
given that respondents with serious health conditions were
ineligible for the examination. The distribution by self-
assessed health status suggests that respondents at both ex-
tremes were less likely to participate in the examination:
those who reported being in poor/not-so-good and those
who reported excellent health were under-represented
among participants. As a result of these offsetting influ-
ences, the mean self-reported health status for participants
Key Messages
· By combining self-reported information with clinical data, assays from blood and urine specimens, and performance
assessments, SEBAS allows researchers to elaborate the relationships among the social environment, life challenges
and health in an older population and to examine how biological markers of stress and health enhance our under-
standing of these relationships.
· SEBAS data show that higher socioeconomic status, more contact with friends, greater participation in social activ-
ities, and religious involvement are all associated with lower physiological dysregulation and better health, but family
social ties reveal little, if any, association with physiological dysregulation or cognitive function.
· Findings based on SEBAS data provide only modest support for the theory of allostatic load, showing a weak associ-
ation between exposure to stress and physiological dysregulation.
· Biomarkers derived from blood and urine specimens, especially markers of inflammation, improve morbidity and
mortality prediction compared with self-reports alone, as do interviewer-administered performance assessments
(e.g. peak expiratory flow and grip strength).

and non-participants was the same (3.1 on a five-point
scale where 5 ¼ excellent, P 0.84 based on a t test).
How often have they been followed-up?
A follow-up study was fielded between August 2006 and
the end of January 2007, using a protocol similar to the
2000 SEBAS. The targeted sample included the 1023 re-
spondents who had completed both the home interview
and the health examination in 2000 as well as a refresher
cohort of 660 respondents aged 53­60 in 2006 who were
first interviewed in the 2003 TLSA. Thus, the 2006 SEBAS
comprised a representative cross-section of the Taiwanese
population aged 53 and older.
For the 2006 SEBAS, 1284 were interviewed in their
homes (87% response rate; see Figure 1) and 1036 (81%
of those interviewed) participated in the physical examin-
ation. Both the youngest (those aged 53­59) and oldest
(80þ) age groups were less likely to participate in the
examination. Participants were also more likely to be

Mainlanders (i.e. originally from Mainland China) and less
likely to have difficulty with one or more ADLs than non-
participants (Table 1). However, because of lower participa-
tion rates among both the healthiest and the least healthy
individuals, the average self-reported health status among
participants was very close to that of non-participants
(3.2 vs 3.1 on a five-point scale where 5 ¼ excellent,
P 0.49 based on a t test).
Table 2 focuses on the longitudinal SEBAS sample (i.e.
the 2000 study participants who were followed in 2006),
showing that 757 of the examination participants were re-
interviewed in 2006, 89 were lost to follow-up and 177
had died. Those who were lost to follow-up, and particu-
larly those who had died, were older and more likely to
have difficulty with ADLs than those who completed the
2006 interview. Compared with those interviewed, dece-
dents were less educated, whereas those lost to follow-up
were more educated.
What has been measured?
The SEBAS 2000 in-home interview was conducted by a
local public health nurse and lasted for 1 h on average.2 In
2006, trained interviewers conducted the in-home inter-
view and administered a new module of health assess-
ments, which included in-home measurement of blood
pressure (in addition to the measurements in hospital) and
a set of performance-based tests (i.e. grip strength, lung
capacity, walking speed and chair stands). Together, the
2006 in-home interview and health assessments took about
1.25 h.2
Table 3 summarizes the data collected during the home
interview; Table 4 summarizes the clinical health indica-
tors derived from the physical examination and the blood
and urine samples. Comparisons of the laboratory assay re-
sults for duplicate specimens sent to the laboratory in
Taiwan (Union Clinical Laboratory) indicate high intra-
laboratory correlations (>¼ 0.9) for most markers tested,
with a few notable exceptions (e.g. IGF-1, sICAM-1).
Based on comparisons with results from a laboratory in the
USA (Quest Diagnostics), inter-laboratory correlations
were also generally high (>¼ 0.9), but in some cases (e.g.
HbA1c, IGF-1 and urinary dopamine in 2000; urinary cre-
atinine and urinary cortisol in 2006), the correlations were
much lower (0.60­0.69); for details, see Table 2.2 in the
SEBAS User's Guide.2 Unless otherwise noted, measures

measures are self-explanatory, we highlight a few of them
here. Additional information on study variables can be
found at [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/
studies/3792?q¼SEBAS&searchSource¼icpsr-landing].
In addition to standard measures of socioeconomic sta-
tus (SES), such as education, occupational status and in-
come, SEBAS included the MacArthur Scale of Subjective
Social Status (Table 3).3 Respondents were shown a picture
of a ladder with 10 rungs and told that the ladder repre-
sented where people stood in relation to each other in
Taiwan, with the top of the ladder representing people
who were the best off and the bottom of the ladder repre-
senting people who were the worst off. Respondents were
asked to place themselves on the ladder according to where
they thought they belonged in the hierarchy. The 2000
SEBAS contained a second measure that asked respondents
to rank themselves in their communities rather than in
Taiwan.4
As a complement to the simple self-rated health ques-
tion, which is widely used and has been shown to be a
good predictor of mortality, questions in the 2006 SEBAS
asked the interviewer and the examining physician to as-
sess the respondent's health on the same five-point scale
(excellent, good, average, not so good and poor). In an
analysis of how well these questions predicted 5-year sur-
vival, two unexpected findings emerged: (i) physicians' rat-
ings were weak predictors of survival; and (ii) interviewer
ratings were more powerful predictors of survival than
self-ratings.5 The results suggest that including a simple
question at the end of face-to-face interviews, asking inter-
viewers to provide an assessment of the respondents' over-
all health, may be a powerful and inexpensive addition to
household surveys. Testing in other socio-cultural settings
is needed to further evaluate the utility of such a measure.
Also in 2006, selected items from the Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index (PSQI)6 were added to the survey. Three of
the seven components of the PSQI were included in full
(subjective sleep quality, sleep duration and habitual sleep
efficiency). SEBAS included one of two items from each of
two other components (sleep latency, daytime dysfunc-
tion). Items from the remaining two components (sleeping
disturbances, use of sleeping medication) were excluded.
What has been found?
SEBAS has spurred more than 70 publications, primarily in
social science, health and epidemiology journals. Analyses
using the SEBAS data have covered a range of substantive
and methodological questions; we highlight a few here. For
a list of SEBAS-based publications, see [http://cph.george
town.edu/taiwan.html#2].
Testing the allostatic load framework
The theory underlying allostatic load implies that the ex-
perience or perception of repeated stressful situations can
cause dysregulation in multiple physiological systems
which, in turn, can lead to poor health outcomes.7
Numerous SEBAS analyses have tested hypotheses based
on the theory of allostatic load. In general these studies
find, at most, only modest links between stress and physio-
logical dysregulation.8­13 Thus, based on the measures of
stressful experience and biomarkers typically included in
large-scale biosocial surveys, SEBAS data have provided
little evidence to support the allostatic load framework.

Stronger relationships might have emerged if SEBAS con-
tained more detailed measures of lifetime exposure and re-
sponse to stressors or more comprehensive measures of
biological risk. A comparative study between Taiwan, the
USA and Russia suggests that the connection between per-
ceived stress and physiological dysregulation is stronger in
Russia than in the USA or Taiwan.14 The expected associ-
ation was observed in Muscovites of both sexes, who also
reported the highest levels of perceived stress among the
three populations, but not in the Taiwanese, who reported
the lowest levels of perceived stress. This finding raises the
possibility that the adverse effects of perceived stress on
biomarkers become evident only when the level of stress
reaches some threshold.
Is the blood worth the toil, tears and sweat?
In light of the cost, complex logistics and considerable re-
spondent burden imposed by adding biomarkers to large-
scale surveys, a number of analyses using SEBAS data have
explored whether biomarkers offer incremental value be-
yond self-reported measures, which are easier to collect

and impose less respondent burden. Results demonstrate
that biomarkers improve mortality prediction compared
with self-reports alone, but a collection of individual
markers performs better than a conventional biomarker
summary score (see Figure 2).15 That study also suggests
that collecting a second round of biological measures may
improve mortality prediction compared with one-time
measurement, although the incremental gain may be
small.15 Another study shows that interviewer-administered
performance assessments, particularly peak expiratory flow
and grip strength, also predict mortality above and beyond
self-reported physical functioning.16 Such tests are less inva-
sive than collection of biofluids (and may be less expensive),
but might be equally powerful in predicting downstream
health and mortality.
In a related line of research, analyses of SEBAS data
show that some biomarkers have greater prognostic power
than others. For instance, with the exception of DHEAS,
neuroendocrine markers (i.e. stress hormones) make little
contribution to predicting mortality, whereas inflamma-
tory markers yield the most prognostic value.15 These re-
sults bolster earlier findings suggesting that inflammatory
markers have greater power than standard clinical (i.e. car-
diovascular and metabolic) measures for predicting sur-
vival.17,18 Inflammatory markers also account for a higher
proportion of sex differences in life expectancy at older
ages than standard clinical markers, although no marker
comes close to smoking in this regard.18
Social environment, biomarkers, and health
Additional SEBAS-based analyses show that the social en-
vironment, encompassing position in social hierarchy as
well as linkages within social networks and support

systems and social participation, is related to health in
anticipated and unanticipated ways. For instance, contact
with friends, participation in social activities and/or reli-
gious involvement are associated with lower levels of allo-
static load12 and better health outcomes.19,20 However,
even though the extended family system and filial piety
play important roles in Taiwanese society,21 family social
ties reveal little, if any, association with physiological dys-
regulation12 or cognitive function.19 The SEBAS data re-
veal weak and inconsistent associations between social
relationship indicators and inflammatory markers.22
Other analyses have focused on the relationships among
position in the social hierarchy, biological markers and
health. These studies show the expected inverse relation-
ship between education, income and health23 and that
higher perceived social position is associated with better
health, even after controlling for objective measures of
SES.24,25 The use of cross-sectional data, however, may
overestimate the relationship between subjective social sta-
tus and health because the relationship between perceived
social status and subsequent health is greatly attenuated
when controlling for baseline health.25
An ongoing discussion in the literature concerns how
`SES gets under the skin' to affect health. In this regard,
SEBAS data have been used to examine whether biological
markers mediate the relationship between SES and health:
several studies indicate that biomarkers have accounted for
only a small part of the social disparities in health in
Taiwan,23,26,27 Costa Rica27 and the USA.27 However, a
similar analysis of education, biomarkers and health in
Russia reveals exceptionally large social disparities in
health among Muscovites; biomarkers account for a larger
share of those disparities than in some countries that have
been studied.28
What are the main strengths and
weaknesses?
Perhaps the most notable strength of the data is the detail
and breadth of the available indicators related to health,
the social environment and life challenges. First, as seen in
Table 4, the data contain an unusually large array of biolo-
gical markers, including several genetic markers. Current
work includes assays for additional genes and single nu-
cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); the public-use data file
will be updated for these markers when the work is com-
plete. Second, self-reported measures cover: multiple di-
mensions of health status (physical, emotional and
Figure 2. AUC improvements over baseline model from models predicting 5-year mortality as a function of self-reported indicators and biomarkers.
In addition to age, the baseline model controls for sex, ethnicity (Mainlander vs Taiwanese), urban residence, education, social integration and per-
ceived availability of social support. The self-reported health indicators include global self-assessed health, an index of mobility limitations, history of
diabetes, history of cancer, number of hospitalizations in the past 12 months and smoking status. The biomarkers comprise eight standard cardiovas-
cular/metabolic risk factors, four inflammatory markers, four neuroendocrine markers and three other markers that do not represent a common biolo-
gical subsystem. The biomarker summary score counts the number of markers (out of 19) for which the respondent exhibits a high-risk level, which
is defined by established cutoffs for the standard cardiovascular/metabolic factors and C-reactive protein (CRP) and by the high-risk quartile for the re-
maining markers. AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Source: Glei et al.15

cognitive); several health-related behaviours; and use of
biomedical and traditional health-care facilities and pro-
viders. Third, interviewer-administered health assessments
offer yet another method for evaluating the respondent's
health. Fourth, the data include high quality information
for determining survival status. Finally, SEBAS includes in-
dicators of both objective and subjective socioeconomic
status, social relationships and exposure to stressors rang-
ing from daily hassles to trauma.
Other strengths include: a relatively large, nationally
representative sample; an age range that includes persons
as young as 53; high participation rates; and longitudinal
follow-up with low loss to follow-up. Nonetheless, the
data also have limitations. As with any study of an older
population, those who died at relatively early ages are not
represented; yet, the proportion of the Taiwanese popula-
tion dying before age 53 is small at 7.5% in 2006.29 Even
so, surveying people in middle or older ages limits our abil-
ity to obtain reliable information about events that
occurred much earlier in life (e.g. childhood). In addition,
the subset of respondents for whom longitudinal bio-
marker data are available is much smaller than the sample
of respondents interviewed in either wave (N ¼ 639 partici-
pated in both the 2000 and 2006 physical examination, see
Figure 1). Lastly, as with other general surveys of health
and ageing, in order to obtain breadth of information,
SEBAS must sacrifice depth of detail collected about any
particular area. For instance, psychologists might mourn
the limited data on personality, whereas others might pine
for more detailed economic or contextual measures.
Can I get hold of the data? Where can I find
out more?
The data and documentation are maintained and distrib-
uted by the National Archive of Computerized Data on
Aging (NACDA) within the Inter-university Consortium of
Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA (persistent URL: http://
www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACDA/studies/3792/ver
sion/5). The dataset includes information from the: (i)
2000 SEBAS for the N ¼ 1023 respondents who completed
the home interview and the physical examination; and (ii)
2006 SEBAS for the N ¼ 1284 respondents who completed
the home interview (including clinical data for those who
also participated in the examination: N ¼ 1036). Users
interested in obtaining and using these data must complete
a Data Use Agreement form available by contacting ICPSR
User Support (1-734-647-2200) or by downloading the
form at the website noted above. Upon receipt of the data
use agreement and supporting documents, a copy of the
data will be sent to the primary user.
The public-use dataset includes limited data from
the parent study (TLSA). Additional information about
accessing the TLSA [http://www.hpa.gov.tw/english/
