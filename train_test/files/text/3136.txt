Filial caregiving has significant public health implications.1
More than 65 million people, 29% of the US population, pro-
vide care for a chronically ill, disabled, or aged family mem-
ber or friend during any given year. The largest proportion of
family caregivers--36%--provide care for a parent.2
Providing care to disabled elderly parents has been associ-
ated with considerable strain, burden, psychological distress,
and poorer physical health.3­8 Research across multiple types
of family caregiving has suggested that caregivers are at risk
of poorer immune system functioning, increased rates of
infectious illness, and other biological vulnerabilities that
can increase the risk of health problems.9
Nonetheless, while growing evidence from caregiving
research suggests that providing caregiving is linked to poten-
tial adverse effects on caregivers' physical health, relatively
little of this research has addressed associations between car-
egiving and underlying biological factors linked to health.7
The limited number of studies that have investigated biologi-
cal factors among caregivers10­13 have been typically based on
nonrandom samples, have typically assessed only one or a few
individual biological markers, and/or have not differentiated
caregivers by caregiving relationship type--a difference that
has been shown to be important in previous research.14­16
Additionally, gender differences in caregiving research related
to biological risks have not been consistently examined.
To address some of the limitations of previous research,
the purpose of this exploratory study was to use data from a
US national survey to examine the associations between one
specific type of family caregiving--care for a biological or
adoptive parent--and four clinically assessed biological risk
factor indices (a 15-item assessment of allostatic load (AL)

Abstract
Objectives: This study examined associations between providing caregiving for a biological or adoptive parent and clinically
assessed biological risk factors (allostatic load and its three subscales--inflammatory dysfunction, metabolic dysfunction, and
neuroendocrine dysfunction), as well as moderation of these associations by gender.
Methods: Regression models were estimated using telephone and self-report data from 962 men and women who
participated in the National Survey of Midlife in the United States in 2005.
Results: Filial caregivers demonstrated higher levels of neuroendocrine dysfunction. No gender difference in biological risks
was found.
Discussion: Filial caregiving is the most prevalent form of family caregiving, and results indicating the presence of greater
neuroendocrine dysfunction among filial caregivers in contrast to noncaregivers suggest an important public health concern.
Future research needs to continue to examine different relationship types of caregivers and include a range of biological risk
measurement to further the understanding of how family caregiving is linked to biological health risks.

Theoretical and empirical foundation
Biopsychosocial approach to health
In recent biomedical studies, models taking a biopsychoso-
cial approach to health have become more prominent. These
models help highlight how psychosocial factors such as
extreme/chronic stress can potentially have adverse effects on
biological factors related to health.17 Also, the biopsychoso-
cial approach posits that psychosocial factors have impact on
biological factors by predisposing the individual to additional
psychosocial risk factors, which can have indirect influences
on health. For example, extreme stress can directly lead to
biological changes linked to heart disease but also can lead
the person to be more likely to be depressed and use alcohol,
which, in turn, can also contribute to problematic physical
health. Therefore, the effects of problematic psychosocial
factors (e.g. stressful events, chronic stresses) can cause an
increased probability of having physical health problems,
biopsychosocial diseases, and/or higher mortality.18
Diverse empirical studies on caregiving and health have
indicated that family caregiving is a stressful life challenge
that typically includes various psychosocial stressors that
can be hazardous to caregivers' health.7 Additionally, sub-
stantial research has demonstrated the association between
caregiving and poorer mental health,4 which, in turn, is an
example of another psychosocial factor that might be
expected to problematically influence physical health.
Drawing upon the biopsychosocial model's assumptions
regarding the associations between stressful psychosocial
factors and their effects on biological health factors and
physical health, this study examined associations between
filial caregiving (vs noncaregiving) and health-related bio-
logical risk factors.
A life course perspective on caregiving
This study was also guided by a life course theoretical per-
spective on caregiving. The life course principle of "linked
lives"19 draws attention to how family members' develop-
mental trajectories (including mental and physical health tra-
jectories) are consequentially interdependent and "linked"
across time. Therefore, transitions and experiences of one
member of a family (e.g. an elder experiencing a transition to
greater disability or frailty) might be expected to have devel-
opmental consequences for other members of the family
(e.g. an adult child who observes undesirable change in a
parent's health and transitions into taking a greater role in
providing care for his or her parent).
The life course perspective additionally guides us to con-
sider important contextual factors when considering the
developmental effects of a role, such as a caregiving role.20
There is considerable evidence that in contemporary society,
the social script for a caregiver role is gendered; that is, nor-
mative expectations for caregiving are typically different for
women in contrast to men.21,22 Women more often assume
the role of primary caregiver (in contrast to secondary car-
egiver) than men; women typically engage in more hands-on
tasks, especially intimate personal care than men;21,22 and
women are socialized to view caregiving as a more salient
role in their role-identity repertoires than men and to be more
empathetic to the suffering of a loved one than men, thereby
making them even more vulnerable to compromised well-
being when stresses in this role occur.23 Additionally, the
overall structural disadvantages of women in gender rela-
tions in contemporary societies (e.g. lower incomes in simi-
lar work roles, more responsibilities for child care and other
extended kinship care, greater overall economic vulnerabil-
ity) would lead us to expect that men might suffer less and
women might suffer more in a caregiving role.24 Nonetheless,
an alternative hypothesis might be that due to being less
socialized to anticipate a caregiving role, less socialized to
feel comfortable seeking help when stresses accumulate, and
perhaps having less access to a larger social support network,
men might have their own unique health risks in a caregiving
role.25 Given these considerations, a life course perspective
guided us to consider potential gender differences in health
risk for a filial caregiving role.
AL
While considerable research on caregiving and physical
health relies on self-reported survey measures, it is also valu-
able to consider clinically assessed health-related biological
risk factors to understand even more clearly the mechanisms
whereby caregiving may get "under the skin" and influence
physical health. AL has been developed as a concept to cap-
ture the idea of overall level of cumulative biological system
dysfunction resulting from stress overload.26 This is relevant
to caregiving in that evidence from previous studies suggests
that caregiving can be an acute stress for caregivers, and long-
term caregiving can often be a chronic stress for caregivers.5
Human body systems respond to both body states and
external environments by adaptation activities. This adapta-
tion process includes reactions by the neuroendocrine (hypo-
thalamic­pituitary­adrenal (HPA) axis/sympathetic nervous
system (SNS)), the inflammatory/immune system, and the
metabolic/cardiovascular system. The allostasis response of
these systems is activated rapidly when individuals are cop-
ing with a certain challenge and adaptation and turned off
when they do not need to be activated. However, these sys-
tems become dangerous and lead to health risks when they
are overly stressed, and breakdowns occur such that they are
not turned off or turned down appropriately. Additionally,
when these systems cannot be turned on when needed, this
inappropriate response can also produce a load on the body
Kang and Marks 3
causing lack of normal protection and undesirable elevation
of other systems' activity.26 Adversity and stressful circum-
stances (e.g. caregiving) are likely to accelerate pathophysi-
ological processes and lead to higher chances of morbidity
and mortality and more susceptibility to cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD).26
Although some studies of caregiving and biological risk
have evaluated one biomarker measure or another (e.g. cor-
tisol, interleukin-6 (IL-6)), a cumulative measure of bio-
markers that constitutes a more complete assessment of AL
has shown promise as a measure of overall underlying health
risk in other areas of gerontological health research. Seeman
et al.27 helped formulate the theoretical rationale for AL
measurement and further led in operationalizing AL utilizing
a risk factor "count" measure based on 10 biomarkers,
including measures of systolic blood pressure, diastolic
blood pressure, waist­hip ratio (WHR), high-density lipo-
proteins (HDLs), total cholesterol, blood plasma levels of
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum dehydroepian-
drosterone sulfate (DHEA-S; a functional HPA axis antago-
nist), C excretion (an integrated measure of 12-h HPA axis
activity), norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Utilizing data
from a sample of over a thousand relatively healthy adults
aged 70­79 years participating in the MacArthur Study of
Successful Aging, they demonstrated that cross-sectionally
AL was linked to poorer baseline physical functioning and
cognitive performance. Additionally, they began to establish
the predictive validity (over 2.5 years) of AL by providing
evidence that it predicted greater declines in physical health
status and cognitive status and a trend toward a greater inci-
dence of problematic CVD events (controlling for sociode-
mographic characteristics and baseline health status).
Importantly, in this initial study, they also established that no
one biomarker predicted these same declines and CVD
events--providing evidence that a measure that includes
multisystemic biomarker components has added value over
individual measures in capturing the biological changes that
predict health decline and mortality.
Seeman et al.28 extended this program of work utilizing
7-year longitudinal data from the MacArthur Study of
Successful Aging to further investigate the predictive valid-
ity of AL and added more evidence of significant associa-
tions between higher AL scores and increased risks of
mortality, greater declines in cognitive functioning, and
greater declines in physical functioning over time.
Recent theorizing on AL has highlighted the value of
including biomarkers related to inflammatory dysfunction in
AL measurement (the original measure only included bio-
markers related to metabolic dysfunction and neuroendo-
crine dysfunction) and has also suggested the possibility that
various systems' components of AL may be sequentially
affected over time in the stress process. For example, it may
be that stress first results in neuroendocrine dysfunction,
which later also leads to inflammatory dysfunction, which,
in turn, may also provoke metabolic dysfunction.29,30 Such
temporal theorizing suggests the value of examining the
underlying systemic components of AL separately, as well as
examining a total AL score.
A recent review of 58 studies using AL to explore how
stress is linked to cognitive and physical health29 provides a
considerable accumulation of evidence regarding the value of
AL as a tool to help evaluate individuals at higher risk of
adverse health outcomes. Establishing the predictive validity
ofAL for future health outcomes has also brought more atten-
tion to the importance of understanding factors that help pre-
dict higher levels of AL and that might help buffer the impact
of stressors on AL--including psychosocial factors such as
histories of social relationships and social integration.31,32
Given the important demonstrated associations between
measures of AL and health, and its relevance to the potential
for the stresses of caregiving to impact current and future
health and mortality, this study explored the associations
between caregiving and AL operationalized by a cumulative
measure of 15 health-related biological indicators. We also
separately examined three subscales of this full AL scale,
including measures indicating neuroendocrine dysfunction
(four-item subscale: cortisol, norepinephrine, epinephrine,
and DHEA), inflammatory dysfunction (five-item subscale:
IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), E-selectin, intercellular
adhesion molecule (ICAM), and fibrinogen), and metabolic
dysfunction (six-item subscale: systolic blood pressure, dias-
tolic blood pressure, WHR, cholesterol, hemoglobin, and
HDL-cholesterol).
Empirical research linking caregiving and
biological factors linked to health
A number of studies have indicated health-related biological
factor risks linked to caregiving. For example, Clark et al.33
examined the association between caregiving and AL across
80 spousal caregivers of dementia patients, 120 veteran car-
egivers, and 60 noncaregivers. Results suggested that the AL
score increased over 2 years among caregivers, whereas there
was no significant increase over time among noncaregivers.
Studies have also indicated that compared to noncaregiv-
ers, caregivers demonstrate poorer immune function, slower
wound healing, or dysregulation of natural killer cell activ-
ity;13,34­36 are at greater risk to have elevated levels of prob-
lematic inflammatory markers in their blood and evidence of
CVD;12,37­40 and exhibit more risks in neuroendocrine,
stress-related hormone dysregulation.34,41­43 Nonetheless,
while researchers have demonstrated that caregivers have
more physiological problems across these multiple domains
than noncaregivers, few studies have used nationally repre-
sentative data, focused specifically on filial caregivers,
included sociodemographic controls also associated with
health, and included a noncaregiver comparison group in
their research designs.
Therefore, guided by the biopsychosocial model of health,
and the accumulating overall evidence suggesting a link
4 SAGE Open Medicine
between caregiving and negative effects on biological health
risk factors, in this exploratory population study, we hypoth-
esized that filial caregiving would be linked to more prob-
lematic levels of biological risk (as assessed by AL and
subscales of AL).
Gender differences in associations between filial
caregiving and biological health
Overall, research to date suggests that women caregivers
experience poorer global health than men caregivers,9,44
although there is also some evidence that men caregivers are
at more risk of poorer immune function45 and metabolic dys-
function.46,47 Very few studies of caregiving and biological
health indicators have examined gender differences in
research designs that include both caregivers and noncar-
egivers. And we have not found a previous study that has
focused specifically on potential gender differences in filial
caregiving influences on biological factors. Therefore,
guided by the available empirical research on caregiving and
physical health, in this exploratory population study, we
hypothesized that women filial caregivers would exhibit
higher levels of biological health factor risks (as measured
by AL and its subscales) than men filial caregivers.
Methods
Data and analytic sample
Data for our analyses came from the national random digit
dialing (RDD) sample of the National Survey of Midlife in
the United States (MIDUS).48 The MIDUS included 3487
noninstitutionalized, English-speaking adults living in the
United States at Time 1 (T1) (1995­1996) and included a
telephone survey and a mail-back self-administered ques-
tionnaire. Follow-up data collection took place about 9 years
later (Time 2 (T2): 2005). Siblings and a national twin sam-
ple were also included in the T2 study. The MIDUS website
provides details regarding the data set and data collection
procedures (http://midmac.med.harvard.edu/research.html).
The analytic sample for this study included 962 adults
(women = 515 and men = 447) aged 34­84 years at T2 who
participated in the biomarker study (a randomly generated
subset of T2 survey respondents who came in for 2 days of
clinical assessment to one of three regional medical centers
after completing the telephone survey and self-administered
mail-back survey). Caregiving status was not explicitly
assessed at MIDUS T1, but it was added and assessed via the
MIDUS phone questionnaire at T2 (see more in section
"Independent variables" below). Due to our research focus
on the relationship between filial caregiving, gender, and
clinically assessed biological risk factors, we limited our
analytic sample to T2 national survey main respondents and
twin respondents who participated in the MIDUS biomarker
study and who in the telephone survey reported either
(1) they were not providing caregiving for anyone or (2) they
were a caregiver for a parent. (This excluded 6% of the T2
sample who were "other" types of caregivers from the ana-
lytic sample. See more details on the caregiving status meas-
ure later in this section.)
Outcome variables
AL.Following the precedent of Seeman et al.27,28 and the
majority of studies that have used an AL measure,29 this
study used a risk factor "count" scale to assess respondents'
AL. Our scale also included items assessing inflammatory
dysfunction and therefore was a 15-item scale (in contrast to
the original 10-item scale developed by Seeman et al.27). Our
AL total scale included indicators of systolic blood pressure,
diastolic blood pressure, WHR, cholesterol, hemoglobin,
HDL, cholesterol, cortisol, norepinephrine, epinephrine,
DHEA, IL-6, CRP, E-selectin, ICAM, and fibrinogen. Fol-
lowing previous precedent in creating AL scales,27,28 quartile
values for all 15 items were calculated to create dichotomous
variables for each item where 1 = high-risk quartile (i.e. high
risk = being in highest quarter of the distribution for systolic
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, WHR, cholesterol,
hemoglobin, cortisol, norepinephrine, epinephrine, IL-6,
CRP, E-selectin, ICAM, and fibrinogen and high risk =
being in lowest quarter of the distribution for HDL-choles-
terol and DHEA) and 0 = otherwise. Note that overall, clini-
cal cut points for risk for most of these variables have not
been established, and typically there have not been different
cut points for risk suggested for women in contrast to men--
with one exception. WHR functions differently for men and
women. Therefore, in the case of this one variable in the
index, we used the top quarter cut point to signify high risk
based on gender-separate distributions. The total AL varia-
ble was created by summing across the 15 dichotomous vari-
ables for "high risk": systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood
pressure, WHR, cholesterol, hemoglobin, HDL-cholesterol,
cortisol, norepinephrine, epinephrine, DHEA, IL-6, CRP,
E-selectin, ICAM, and fibrinogen (range 0­15). (See descrip-
tives for all analytic variables in Table 1. See correlations for
all analytic variables in Table 2.)
Inflammatory dysfunction.This study also evaluated a five-
item subscale of the full AL measure described above to
assess respondents' inflammatory dysfunction. The inflam-
matory dysfunction subscale variable was created by sum-
ming five of the dichotomous variables noted above for the
AL scale: IL-6, CRP, E-selectin, ICAM, and fibrinogen
(range 0­5).
Metabolic dysfunction.This study also examined a six-item
subscale of the full AL scale to separately assess respond-
ents'metabolic dysfunction. The metabolic dysfunction vari-
able was created by summing six of the dichotomous
high-risk variables noted above for the AL scale: systolic
Kang and Marks 5
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, WHR, cholesterol,
hemoglobin, and HDL-cholesterol (range 0­6).
Neuroendocrine dysfunction. This study also used a four-item
subscale of the full AL scale to assess respondents' neuroen-
docrine dysfunction. The neuroendocrine dysfunction varia-
ble was created by summing four of the dichotomous
high-risk variables noted for the AL scale: cortisol, norepi-
nephrine, epinephrine, and DHEA (range 0­4).
Independent variables
Caregiving status.In the phone questionnaire at T2, partici-
pants were asked whether during the last 12 months they had
given personal care for a period of 1 month or more to a fam-
ily member or a friend because of a physical or mental condi-
tion, illness, or disability. Respondents who answered "yes"
were asked to indicate to whom they gave the most personal
care (relationship type: husband, wife, son, daughter, father,
mother, brother, sister, etc.). For this study, focused solely
on filial care, we created a dichotomous variable--parent
care--which was coded 1 if the respondent indicated they
had provided caregiving to a biological or adoptive mother
or father (n = 46, women = 30 and men = 16) and coded 0 if
respondents had answered "no" they did not provide any per-
sonal care to this extent to a family member or a friend dur-
ing the past 12 months (n = 916, women = 485 and men =
431). Respondents who indicated they provided any other
type of caregiving (e.g. spousal care, child care, parent-in-
law care, other kin care, nonkin care) were excluded from
this analysis.
Demographic control variables.Given findings from previous
studies indicating that a number of sociodemographic varia-
bles are associated with physical health,49,50 we controlled for
several of these factors to avoid confounding effects: gender
(dichotomous, 1 = female), respondents' age (continuous),
household income (continuous, including respondents'reports
of income from all sources, as well as their reports of all
spousal income), educational attainment (continuous, using
categories: 1 = no school/some grade school (1­6) to 12 =
PhD, EdD, MD, DDS, LLD, JD, or other professional degree),
race/ethnicity (dichotomous, 1 = non-Hispanic White), paren-
tal status at T2 (dichotomous, 1 = parent of a child), employ-
ment status (dichotomous, 1 = currently employed), and
marital status (dichotomous, 1 = currently married) at T2.
Data analysis
Ordinary least squares multiple regression models were esti-
mated (using pairwise deletion to maximize retention of
cases) to investigate the associations between filial caregiv-
ing andAL and its constituent subscales.All models included
all demographic control variables. To test our hypothesis
regarding the main effect of filial caregiving on biological
health outcomes, we estimated models for each outcome in
which each outcome was regressed on the dichotomous vari-
able (parent care) indicating whether respondents were filial
caregivers or not (Model 1 (M1)). To examine our hypothe-
sis regarding moderator effects of gender on associations
between filial caregiving and clinically assessed health-
related biological factor, Model 2 (M2) added the interaction
term Female × Parent care.

for their parents were reporting higher levels of inflamma-
tory dysfunction (Table 3, M1, b = .16, NS). Additionally, no
subgroup difference by gender was revealed in the associa-
tion between parent caregiving and inflammatory dysfunc-
tion (Table 3, M2, b = .12, NS).
Metabolic dysfunction.Findings did not reveal a significant
difference in levels of metabolic dysfunction for parent car-
egivers in contrast to noncaregivers (Table 3, M1, b = .08,
NS). No evidence was found for a difference by gender in the
association between levels of metabolic dysfunction and car-
egiving among parent caregivers in contrast to noncaregivers
(Table 3, M2, b = -.46, NS).
Neuroendocrine dysfunction. Congruent with our hypothesis,
respondents who reported they were providing caregiving
for their parents demonstrated higher levels of neuroendo-
crine dysfunction compared to respondents who reported
they were not providing any type of caregiving (Table 3, M1,
b = .28, p  .05). No subgroup difference by gender was
found in the association between parent caregiving and neu-
roendocrine dysfunction (Table 3, M2, b = -.42, NS).
In sum, findings indicated that providing care for a parent
was linked to higher levels of neuroendocrine dysfunction;
this association was similar for caregiving daughters and
sons.
Discussion
Guided by a biopsychosocial model, this study aimed to uti-
lize population evidence to investigate whether caregiving
for a biological or adoptive parent is linked to higher levels
of clinically assessed biological health risks among caregiv-
ers in contrast to noncaregivers, as well as to evaluate
whether gender moderates these health risks.
Our results provide the first population study­based evi-
dence of which we are aware that filial caregivers, specifi-
cally, are at greater risk of neuroendocrine dysfunction than
noncaregivers, adjusting also for numerous sociodemo-
graphic factors. While filial caregivers demonstrated higher
risk of neuroendocrine dysfunction--which is a primary sys-
tem linked to stress and adaptation, controlling reactions to
stress, and regulating many body processes--we did not find
that this risk extended to our additional measures of inflam-
matory dysfunction and metabolic dysfunction, nor to our
overall evaluation of AL (that combined all three of these
subscales).
Filial caregiving is the most prevalent form of caregiving,
and it is the most common type of caregiving that adults are
likely to experience at some point or at multiple points across
their lives.2 There are somewhat different normative expec-
tations for filial caregiving than for spousal caregiving or
caregiving for a disabled child,51 which may have led to
some earlier findings that filial caregiving is sometimes less
problematic for health than other types of caregiving.52
Nonetheless, empathizing with the suffering of an important
attachment figure,23 and participating in the "role reversal"
and potential physical and emotional strain that can come for
an adult child when a parent is no longer fully capable of
taking care of themselves, has the potential to put filial car-
egivers at biological risk of poorer health outcomes.
Compared to other types of caregiving, filial caregivers also
may be even more likely to experience the additional stress
that comes from having role conflicts between their internal-
ized normative expectations for filial caregiving and the
expectations and demands in their employment, marital/part-
ner, and parenting roles. This stress, in turn, may become
reflected in their impaired neuroendocrine profiles.
Given recent interest in determining within AL whether
there is evidence of a temporal sequencing of biological

systems impacted by stress--for example, first neuroendocrine
dysfunction, then immune dysfunction, leading further to meta-
bolic dysfunction30--our results are not conclusive, but they
may suggest that over time filial caregivers could progress to
other biological risks. Future research carefully tracking any
potential progression in elevation of other biological risks
among filial caregivers would be helpful in better mapping this
potential temporal sequence.
We note here that we undertook preliminary, supplemen-
tary analyses (not shown) where we estimated similar models
across a combination of filial, spousal, child, and parent-in-
law caregivers in the MIDUS study. These analyses did not
provide evidence of a significant association between com-
bined family caregiving and AL; there was one significant
association between combined family caregiving and meta-
bolic dysfunction, but not other subscales. No gender differ-
ences were in evidence when we examined moderating
effects utilizing the combined family caregiving variable.
Further supplementary analyses (not shown) indicated that
spousal caregiving was associated with higher levels of meta-
bolic dysfunction--making it likely that it was this group that
was driving the finding for the combined family caregiving
variable results. Because there was a limited number of male
spousal caregivers, it was not optimal powerwise to examine
gender differences in the effects of spousal caregiving. We
believe that these supplementary analyses also strengthen our
case for arguing the importance of examining each caregiving
relationship type separately to provide a more nuanced under-
standing of potential differences in caregiving type associa-
tions with biological factors linked to health outcomes.
Regarding our second hypothesis about gender, we did
not find evidence that caregiving daughters suffered more
biological health risk when providing care to a parent than
caregiving sons. Although Pinquart and Sorensen5,6 have
done reviews of the research that have indicated gender dif-
ferences in health among caregivers, they have also found
evidence that gender differences are smaller in physical
health than mental health outcomes,5 and they have specu-
lated that gender differences in health may be diminishing
among younger cohorts of persons due to more similar gen-
der roles in contemporary society.6 Controlling for a number
of caregiver resources and supports, Pinquart and Sorensen6
still found small gender differences in health among caregiv-
ers in their formal meta-analysis of studies, but these became
similar to gender differences in health in the noncaregiving
population. They speculated that additional resource differ-
ences between men and women that they did not adjust for
may have also led to these remaining differences. In this
study, we did adjust for a number of additional factors that
can differ between men and women and that are associated
with health--for example, household income, employment
status, race/ethnicity, marital status, and marital quality--
and this might have also influenced our finding of no gender
differences among filial caregivers in biological risks.
It also may be that some of the factors that have been
hypothesized to make men more vulnerable to health risks in
caregiving25 are balancing out the additional stressors of car-
egiving typically observed for women.6 Our relatively
smaller sample of men filial caregivers in this study may
have also reduced our power to find gender differences. The

issue of inconsistencies in research on gender differences in
physical health among caregivers remains one for future
research to continue to investigate and explain more
comprehensively.
Despite this study's conceptual and methodological
strengths, several limitations need to be acknowledged. Due
to the lack of measurement of caregiving due to illness or
disability at T1 in MIDUS, we needed to conduct a cross-
sectional analysis here, even though the data set is longitudi-
nal. Thus, we can only describe associations here, and any
inferences regarding causality must be considered tenuous.
Even though this study is from a relatively large national
sample, our sample of filial caregivers is still not very large,
particularly when gender differences are examined. Therefore,
some of our lack of finding significant associations may be due
to power considerations and must be viewed with caution.
Another limitation of our study is the fact that due to the
limitation in our caregiving measure, respondents were clas-
sified as caregivers without taking into account how long
they had been providing caregiving, the intensity of
caregiving (e.g. hours per week), coresidence, reasons for
caregiving (e.g. dementia vs surgery), and whether they were
a primary or secondary caregiver. Where we did have some
additional information--for example, about average hours
per week of caregiving--we did not have sufficient sample
size to further create subgroups. All these factors might be
additional moderators of caregivers' health risk5­7,53 and
would be beneficial to include in future research.
Although due to cell sizes we were not able to control for
additional differences among our caregivers, it may be of
some value for readers to have a little more descriptive infor-
mation about the filial caregivers in our sample when consid-
ering our results. For example, we found that about 37% of
the filial caregivers in our study reported that they coresided
with the care recipient while the care was being provided; an
additional 2% reported coresiding "some of the time." About
two-thirds (67%) of filial caregivers reported helping with
such personal care as bathing, dressing, and going to the
bathroom. About four-fifths (80%) reported that they helped
their parent with getting around inside and outside the home.
About three-quarters (74%) reported helping with things like
shopping, cooking, and housework. Almost three-quarters
(72%) reported helping with managing money and medica-
tions. About one-quarter (24%) reported helping their parent
every week of the last 12 months. But another almost two-
thirds (65%) reported helping their parent less than half the
weeks (i.e. less than 26 weeks) of the last year. The average
hours of helping across the weeks helped was 14 h. The
modal response on caregiving hours per week was 20. This
supplemental information suggests that the filial caregivers
in our study were, indeed, a heterogeneous group--varying
in reported intensity (and potential strain) of care. In some
respects, this variation makes it even more noteworthy that
we found a significant problematic difference in neuroendo-
crine dysfunction for this group.
In sum, findings from this study, which document the
association between providing filial caregiving and
greater neuroendocrine dysfunction risk, provide addi-
tional empirical support for the public health importance
of enacting policies and practices supportive of filial car-
egivers. Filial caregivers comprise the largest proportion
of informal caregivers in contemporary society. They are
providing caregiving to a large number of care recipients,
and in doing so, they may also be putting their own health
at risk and creating a new tier of public health concern and
cost.1 Additional research is needed to better clarify these
risks and evaluate factors and policy supports that may
mitigate them.
