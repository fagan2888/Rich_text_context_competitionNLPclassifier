Increase in
Clostridium
difficile­related
Mortality Rates,
United States,
1999­2004
Matthew D. Redelings,* Frank Sorvillo,*
and Laurene Mascola*
Reported mortality rates from Clostridium difficile dis-
ease in the United States increased from 5.7 per million
population in 1999 to 23.7 per million in 2004. Increased
rates may be due to emergence of a highly virulent strain
of C. difficile. Rates were higher for whites than for other
racial/ethnic groups.
Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, gram-positive ba-
cillus that can cause considerable disease, including
diarrhea, colitis, and septicemia, resulting in death (1). C.
difficile­associated disease (CDAD) primarily affects per-
sons >65 years. Risk factors include residence in hospitals
and long-term care facilities and the use of antimicrobial
medications (1­3). Incidence of CDAD has been increas-
ing, and severe cases are becoming more common (4,5).
These changes in the incidence and severity of CDAD may
be associated with the emergence of a more virulent strain
of C. difficile bacteria (5,6). Death rates associated with C.
difficile were reported to be increasing from 1999 to 2002
in the United States and from 2001 to 2005 in England and
Wales (7,8). However, no trend analysis was conducted to
evaluate the rate of increase. We incorporated mortality
data for the United States through the year 2004 to con-
duct trend analyses of CDAD-related deaths and to exam-
ine demographic characteristics and coexisting conditions
reported in deaths from C. difficile infection.
The Study
CDAD-related deaths were identified by using mul-
tiple cause-of-death data from national mortality records
for 1999­2004. CDAD-related deaths were defined as all
deaths for which the underlying cause of death or any of
the contributing causes of death included the International
Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) code
A04.7 (enterocolitis due to C. difficile). Information about
the size and demographic breakdown of the US population
for each year during 1999­2004 was obtained from censal
and intercensal year estimates with bridged race data (9,10).
Age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated by using the
age distribution of the 2000 US population as a standard
(11). The US population was divided into 5 racial/ethnic
categories: white, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, black,
and American Indian/Alaska Native.
During 1999­2004, CDAD was reported as a cause of
death for 20,642 persons. CDAD was reported as the un-
derlying cause for 12,264 (59%) of these deaths. A total
of 3,256 deaths were reported related to all other intestinal
infectious diseases combined (ICD-10 codes A00 to A09,
excluding A047) over the same period. The median age of
death for CDAD patients was 82 years. Age-adjusted mor-
tality rates from CDAD were slightly higher for men than
for women (Table) and were higher for whites than for any
other racial/ethnic group. Most CDAD-related deaths oc-
curred in hospitals (n = 16,557, 80%); 1,634 (8%) occurred
in long-term care facilities, and 2,027 (10%) occurred at
home.
Common coexisting conditions for CDAD-related
deaths included septicemia (n = 7,654, 37%), renal failure
(n = 4,786, 23%), pneumonia (n = 3,430, 17%), urinary
tract infection (n = 1,496, 7%), and anemia (n = 785, 4%).
HIV was reported for 81 CDAD-related deaths (<1%).
However, among the 697 deaths reported in persons 25­54
years of age, HIV was reported for 72 (10%).
The overall rate of C. difficile­related deaths during
the study period was 12.2 deaths per million population.
Mortality rates related to CDAD increased during the study
period (Figure), rising from 5.7 deaths per million popula-
tion in 1999 to 23.7 deaths per million population in 2004.
Poisson regression estimates showed mortality rates in-
creased by 35% per year (coefficient = 0.30, standard error
= 0.004, 95% confidence interval = 0.29­0.31) during the
study period.
Conclusions
Due to the inclusion of CDAD-related deaths when
CDAD was not reported as the underlying cause of death,
reported death rates in this study were higher than those
published in an earlier analysis of CDAD-related deaths in
the United States (7). C. difficile is a cause of a substantial
and increasing proportion of deaths in the United States
and may be underrecognized as a cause of death. Little at-
tention has been paid to C. difficile prevention; media and
public health awareness efforts have focused largely on
the prevention of disease from other intestinal pathogens
such as Escherichia coli or Salmonella spp. However, the
incidence of deaths from C. difficile is greater than the ex-
tent of deaths from all other intestinal infectious diseases
combined. C. difficile­related mortality rates were higher

for whites than for other racial/ethnic groups. Racial/eth-
nic differences in insurance status and access to care (12)
may render elderly whites more likely to receive treatment
with antimicrobial drugs that put them at risk for C. dif-
ficile infection. However, genetic or other factors may also
be involved, and further research is needed to determine
the causes of racial/ethnic differences in C. difficile­related
deaths.
Previous research showed increases in CDAD-related
mortality rates in the United States until 2002 (7,8). This
analysis estimates the rate of increase at 35% per year, and
shows that mortality rates continued to increase at least
until 2004. Increases in incidence and deaths from CDAD
may be associated with the emergence of a new and more
virulent strain of C. difficile (5). The emergence of virulent
strains of C. difficile makes continued assessment of mor-
tality statistics important.
Infection with C. difficile is associated with recent use
of antimicrobial medications and with residence in hos-
pitals. Most CDAD cases are acquired in healthcare set-
tings (1), and as many as 90% of cases may be associated
with antimicrobial drug use (2,3). High C. difficile death
rates call attention to the importance of proper infection
control practices in hospitals and long-term care facilities
and the judicious use of antimicrobial medications. Further
research is needed to explore current questions concern-
ing which antimicrobial medications, if any, will lead to
CDAD (13,14).
Infections such as septicemia, pneumonia, and urinary
tract infections were commonly reported in conjunction
with C. difficile­related deaths. For some of these patients,
the administration of antimicrobial medications to treat in-
fections from other pathogens may have paved the way for
infection with C. difficile. However, other risk factors are
known, so that in many cases the careful use of antimicro-
bial agents may not be enough to prevent C. difficile infec-
tion. HIV infection was only reported in a small fraction of
CDAD­related deaths. However, immunosuppression and
the use of prophylactic antimicrobial drugs in persons with
AIDS may increase the risk for CDAD (15), and the effects
of HIV should not be overlooked. In persons 25­54 years

of age, in whom HIV infection is most common, HIV in-
fection was reported in approximately one tenth of CDAD-
related deaths. Thus, HIV can considerably increase C.
difficile death rates for demographic groups in which HIV
prevalence is high.
Death certificate data may underrepresent the extent of
CDAD-related deaths. This analysis was limited to deaths
in which ICD-10 code A047 (enterocolitis due to C. diffi-
cile) was mentioned and may have failed to capture CDAD-
related deaths in which colitis was not present. In addition,
death certificate data may be affected by reporting error.
Supplemental information such as decedents' medical his-
tories was unavailable. No data were available regarding
which strains of C. difficile were responsible for reported
CDAD­related deaths.
C. difficile is an underrecognized cause of severe ill-
ness and death. This analysis underscores the importance
of CDAD as a public health problem and the increasing
incidence of CDAD-related deaths in the United States.
