Abstract
Objective: To test the hypothesis that there would be better clinical outcomes following the
treatment of patients with acute lung injury (ALI) using noninvasive positive-pressure mechanical
ventilation (NIPPV) delivered via a complex critical care ventilator compared with a conventional
mini-ventilator.
Methods: Patients with ALI who required NIPPV were prospectively enrolled and randomly
divided between three intervention groups: group A was ventilated using a mini-ventilator; groups
B and C were ventilated using a complex critical care ventilator using different settings. Clinical
parameters were recorded before and after 8 h of mechanical ventilation.
Results: A total of 51 patients with ALI were enrolled in the study. Clinical parameters in groups B
and C underwent greater improvements than those in group A. Group C demonstrated the lowest
treatment failure rate (23.5%). Failure rates were highest in group A (58.8%).
Conclusion: The findings of this present study suggest that there were more satisfactory clinical
outcomes following the treatment of patients with ALI when NIPPV was delivered using a complex
critical care ventilator compared with a conventional mini-ventilator.

Introduction
Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe
form, acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), are common and devastating com-
plications that occur during acute illness and
following injury. ALI and ARDS are asso-
ciated with high morbidity and mortality
and a long-term decrease in health-related
quality of life;1 they account for a high
proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) bed
use. Invasive mechanical ventilation
through an endotracheal tube is often a
life-saving intervention, but it may cause or
exacerbate lung damage in patients with
ALI/ARDS.2 A number of complications
may occur during invasive mechanical ven-
tilation, such as complications of intubation,
ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP),
ventilator-induced lung injury (e.g. baro-
trauma, volutrauma and biotrauma) and
cardiovascular events.2 Noninvasive posi-
tive-pressure mechanical ventilation
(NIPPV) delivers a positive pressure support
to the lungs without the use of an invasive
artificial airway. During the past 15 years,
NIPPV has become one of the most import-
ant developments in respiratory medicine3,4
and is increasingly being used in many
countries.5 NIPPV can provide a more con-
venient, comfortable and economic type of
ventilation, and has a good safety profile,
compared with invasive mechanical ventila-
tion.6 NIPPV can avoid endotracheal intub-
ation and intubation-related complications,
permits patients to eat, drink, talk and
expectorate, and has become the standard
of care in hypercapnic respiratory failure
secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.7 The application of noninvasive
mechanical ventilation (NIV) in hypoxaemic
acute respiratory failure (ARF) has also
been an area of research over the last two
decades.8 Although two meta-analyses of
randomized controlled trials found no
robust evidence to support the role of
NIV in hypoxaemic ARF and ALI/ARDS,
respectively;9,10 the use of NIV in specific
settings of hypoxaemic ARF (e.g. for pneu-
monia in immunocompromized individuals
and following lung resection surgery) has
been shown to reduce endotracheal intub-
ation rates and even mortality.11 Although
the role of NIPPV in ALI/ARDS remains
controversial, research has indicated that
the use of NIV increased tidal volume and
decreased the inspiratory muscle effort, with
a consequent improvement in dyspnoea and
oxygenation status in patients with ALI.12 A
randomized clinical trial showed the benefit
of using initial NIV treatment in strictly
selected ALI patients.13
Conventional NIPPV is usually provided
by a mini-ventilator using the bilevel posi-
tive airway pressure (PAP) mode. The appli-
cation and outcomes of NIPPV treatment
are limited by the function of the machine
and other aspects. Compared with the use of
mini-ventilators for NIPPV, modern large
ICU ventilators have unparalleled advan-
tages because they offer a full range of
functions, excellent performance and mul-
tiple modes of operation. For example, most
mini-ventilators are triggered by a posterior
pressure sensor, whereas large ICU ventila-
tors are usually triggered by an anterior
flow-rate sensor and are therefore more
sensitive. Mini-ventilators are commonly
employed to deliver NIV, but they use
single-limb tubing that can increase the
amount of CO2
rebreathing. However,
large ICU ventilators can deliver NIV by
double air circuits that can make patients
breathe more smoothly and constrain CO2
retention. Large ICU ventilators have a
higher ventilating pressure and can give
enough tidal volume and minute ventilation
volume. Moreover, they have a wider range
of ventilation modes that can be used for
different types of patients. Our clinical team
has achieved satisfactory results in the treat-
ment of ALI by NIPPV delivered using a
complex critical care ventilator in clin-
ical practice (personal communication).

Therefore, the current study was undertaken
to test the hypothesis that there would be
better clinical outcomes following the treat-
ment of ALI by NIPPV delivered using a
large complex critical care ventilator, com-
pared with a conventional mini-ventilator.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study enrolled consecutive patients who
met the ALI diagnostic criteria14 and were
admitted to the Department of Emergency
Medicine, the Department of Respiratory
Diseases and the surgical ICU (SICU) of the
General Hospital of Tianjin Medical
University between September 2009 and
March 2012. Causes of ALI included
severe bacterial or viral infection, trauma
(abdominal surgery not included) and pan-
creatitis. During mechanical ventilation,
conventional supportive treatments, anti-
infective agents and antishock treatments
were simultaneously administered as and
when required. The study was approved by
the Ethics Committee of the General
Hospital of Tianjin Medical University
(registration number: IRB2009-2015), and
written informed consent was obtained from
all patients or their authorized carers/legal
guardians.
Study design
This study consisted of a prospective part
and a retrospective part. The NIPPV part of
the study was prospective, with enrolled
patients meeting the following inclusion
criteria for ALI patients: (i) willing to
accept NIPPV with a disposable full orona-
sal mask and gastrointestinal decompression
if necessary; (ii) respiratory rate >23
breaths/min at the beginning or using ancil-
lary respiratory muscles; (iii) arterial oxygen
partial pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen
(PaO2
/FiO2
) <300­350 mmHg in standard
nasal cannular oxygen therapy. Delivering
NIPPV via a complex critical care ventilator
only needs the patient to be able to trigger
the flow sensor at a flow rate of 3 l/min, so a
more obvious degree of consciousness, syn-
chronized capability, and respiratory inten-
sity and depth were not required.
A subgroup of patients with ALI met the
diagnostic criteria for ARDS,14 therefore to
compare the use of a complex critical care
ventilator to deliver NIPPV with invasive
mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal
tube, this study also retrospectively recruited
patients with ARDS treated with artifi-
cial airway mechanical ventilation.14 These
patients had been treated at the Department
of Emergency Medicine, the Department of
Respiratory Diseases and the SICU of the
General Hospital of Tianjin Medical
University between November 2008 and
August 2009. These patients did not provide
written or verbal informed consent because
this part of the study was a retrospective
review of case history data, with no treat-
ment intervention.
Mechanical ventilation interventions
For the prospective NIPPV part of the
study, enrolled patients were divided ran-
domly into three groups using a random
number table at study entry and were
ventilated for 8 h continuously according
to the schedules described below. The ven-
tilator parameters could be modulated
according to the conditions 8 h later.
Group A was treated using a conven-
tional mini-ventilator (BREAS iSleep 22
BIPAP; Breas Medical AB, Mo
¨ lnlycke,
Sweden), a disposable oronasal mask and
an auto-bilevel PAP mode, i.e. pressure
support ventilation (PSV) þ positive end
expiratory pressure (PEEP), 7­8 l/min
oxygen flow by an infusing tube (FiO2
about 40­50%). The O2
flow rate could be
increased when PaO2
<40 mmHg continu-
ously. The high-pressure phase was
15 cmH2
O (1 cmH2
O ¼ 0.098 kPa); the
790 Journal of International Medical Research 42(3)
low-pressure phase was 6 cmH2
O, triggered
at 2­3 cmH2
O.
Group B was treated using a new type of
large critical care ventilator (Hamilton
Galileo Gold Ventilator; Hamilton Medical
AG, Bonaduz, Switzerland), a disposable
oronasal mask and a spontaneous mode, i.e.
PSV þ PEEP. FiO2
was 40­60% and FiO2
could be increased when PaO2
<40 mmHg
continuously. The PSV was 9 cmH2
O, but
15 cmH2
O when plus PEEP, which was
6 cmH2
O. The trigger flow-rate was 3 l/min
at the anterior extremity. The expiratory
trigger sensitivity (ETS) was 45%. The
pressure rising time (Pramp) was 25 ms.
Group C was treated using the same new
type of large critical care ventilator, a
disposable oronasal mask and a Duo PAP
mode (Duo PAP þ PSV). FiO2
was 40­60%
and FiO2
could be increased when PaO2
<40 mmHg continuously. The PSV was
9 cmH2
O, but actually 15 cmH2
O during
the low-pressure phase. The high-pressure
phase was 25 cmH2
O and the low-pressure
phase (PEEP) was 6 cmH2
O. The low-pres-
sure phase could be overlapped by PSV. The
high-pressure phase time was 1.5 s.
The mandatory rate was 10 times per min.
The flow-rate trigger was 3 l/min at the
anterior extremity; the ETS was 45%, and
the Pramp was 25 ms.
Clinical parameters (including respira-
tory rate, PaO2
/FiO2
, arterial CO2
partial
pressure [PaCO2
] and blood pH) were rec-
orded and the Murray ALI score was
measured to evaluate the severity of ALI
before the initiation of NIPPV.15 Each
patient was asked try their best to expector-
ate, or a sputum suction tube was used to
aspirate any secretions and then the patient
was given gastrointestinal decompression.
An oropharyngeal tube was used to prevent
the tongue root from falling, if necessary.
This airway secretion aspiration procedure
was performed every 1­2 h as this improves
the effects of treatment. Clinical parameters
were collected again after 8 h of ventilation.
The clinical parameters of groups B and C
included oral obstructive pressure at 0.1 s
after initiation of inhalation (P0.1), rapid
superficial breath (RSB) index, stationary
compliance of the lung (Cstat) and inflection
point, which were computed and analysed
using algorithms and analytical software
built-in to the large critical care ventilator.
Air leakage from the mask was carefully
restricted by adjusting the tighntess of the
headband. The pressure was high, to ensure
ventilation volume, and gastrointestinal
decompression helped to relieve abdominal
distension and prevent digestive tract
haemorrhage.
The retrospectively enrolled patients with
ARDS (retrospective group), who were
mechanically ventilated using an artificial
airway via the mouth, were treated using the
same large critical care ventilator and a
Duo PAP þ PSV mode. The initial FiO2
was
40­60%, but the ventilation parameters
were modulated according to clinical condi-
tions in individual patients.
The treatment was considered to fail after
the standard 8 h of ventilation when the
patient met any one of the following criteria:
(i) cannot tolerate NIPPV; (ii) arterial
oxygen saturation <85% or PaO2
<50 mmHg, or arterial oxygen saturation
!85% or PaO2
!50 mmHg but the patient
needs >60% of the continuous oxygen con-
centration during and after the 8 h of treat-
ment; (iii) serious difficulty with
expectoration; (iv) aggravating symptoms
that were too serious to allow successful
ventilation (e.g. spontaneous respiratory
rate fewer than five breaths per min, too
weak to trigger a breath, low tidal volume);
(v) having to establish an artificial airway;
(vi) patient's death.
The inflection point was measured by the
pressure­volume tools included within the
large critical care ventilator. Although
during noninvasive ventilation there was a
minor error in calculating the inflection
point, recording this information
Zhang et al. 791
remained valuable. An improvement in the
inflection point was defined as: lower inflec-
tion point disappeared; lower inflection
point enlarged to a steep inflection fragment;
the slope rate of the line connecting the
upper and lower inflection points increased;
the slope rate of the tangent line of the
pressure­volume curve across the lower
inflection point increased.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 11.5
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Data are presented as mean
Æ SD or n of patients. Statistical compari-
sons of demographic and baseline clinical
characteristics and improvements in the
clinical parameters among different groups
were performed by one-way analysis of
variance. Independent-samples t-test was
used to compare demographic and baseline
clinical characteristics, and total respiratory
support times, between group C patients
with ARDS and the retrospective group of
patients with ARDS. Exact probabilities in a
2 Â 2 table were used to analyse the devel-
opment of VAP and treatment failure
between groups. A P-value <0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 51 consecutive patients were
enrolled in the prospective part of this
study and were randomly divided into
three treatment groups. Their mean Æ SD
age was 49.96 Æ 9.80 years (range, 32­68
years). Demographic and baseline clinical
characteristics of the patients are presented
in Table 1 and there were no significant
differences between the three groups at
baseline.
Of the 17 patients in group C, nine met
the diagnostic criteria for ARDS and their
ALI scores were >2.5. In order to compare
the two methods of ventilation nine patients

characteristics of these two groups
of patients with ARDS are presented in

spective part of this study.

strated the lowest treatment failure rate
(n ¼ 4; 23.5%) compared with group A,
which demonstrated the highest treatment
failure rate (n ¼ 10; 58.8%). The traditional
mini-ventilator used for group A was unable
to measure the parameters P0.1, RSB index,
Cstat and the inflection point. Significant
improvements were seen in groups B and C
for P0.1, RSB index, and Cstat (P < 0.05 for
all comparisons). Both groups B and C
demonstrated improvements in the inflec-
tion point. The therapeutic effects of
NIPPV that were observed in groups B
and C were better than those observed in
group A. Group C demonstrated the best
improvements, based on the changes in
clinical parameters before and after
ventilation.

this study are presented in Table 4. The use
of a complex critical care ventilator to
deliver NIPPV in nine patients with ARDS
from group C resulted in a significantly

treatment with an invasive ventilation
method in the retrospective group of
patients with ARDS (P < 0.05). In addition,
treatment of patients with ARDS with a
complex critical care ventilator also resulted
in significantly fewer cases of VAP and

Discussion
This present study enrolled 51 patients with
ALI who required mechanical ventilation. A
subgroup of nine patients with ALI, rando-
mized to group C, met the diagnostic criteria
of ARDS. Consequently, the study retro-
spectively enrolled a further nine patients
with ARDS who were treated with artificial
airway mechanical ventilation. The results
of this study indicated that delivering
NIPPV using a large complex critical care
ventilator for patients with ALI was more
clinically effective than delivering
NIPPV using a conventional mini-
ventilator.
Traditional mini-ventilators are usually
triggered by a posterior pressure sensor,
while the complex critical care ventilator
that was used in the present study was
triggered by an anterior flow rate sensor,
and was therefore more sensitive than the
mini-ventilator used in group A. Triggering
by an anterior flow rate sensor can decrease
the reactive time;16 in addition, the complex
critical care ventilator has an adjustable ETS
and Pramp.17 Mini-ventilators, commonly
employed to deliver NIV, use single-limb
tubing that can increase the amount of CO2

rebreathing.18 However, complex critical
care ventilators deliver NIV using double
air circuits, which can make the patient's
breathing smoother and reduce CO2
reten-
tion. Complex critical care ventilators can
shorten the inspiration rising time, which
decreases the cross product of time and
pressure (which is used to estimate the
consumption of respiratory work) and
increases the initial inspiration flow rate,
both of which are efficacious in the inspira-
tory assistance provided by PSV. In add-
ition, complex critical care ventilators can
meet the demands that ALI patients have for
a high initial inspiratory flow rate.19 With a
higher ventilating pressure combined with
an oropharyngeal airway, complex critical
care ventilators can provide adequate tidal
volume and minute ventilation volume, and
improve the oxygenation of patients. The
present study identified better improvements
in the oxygenation index (PaO2
/FiO2
) of
groups B and C compared with group A.
Complex critical care ventilators do not
need to offer a strong matching ability
between patients and they can open the
upper airway more definitely and attain
better synchronization than mini-ventila-
tors. In a multicentre randomized crossover
study, Vignaux et al.20 evaluated the impact
of NIV algorithms used by ICU ventilators
on the incidence of patient­ventilator asyn-
chrony in 65 patients with acute respiratory
failure. The NIV algorithms reduced the
incidence of leak-associated asynchronies.20
They can also reduce the respiratory drive to
lower the respiratory work,21 improve

collapsed alveoli, improve lung compli-
ance and improve the inflection point.
In addition, the increasing tidal volume
and/or the opening of the alveoli can stimu-
late the neural reflex to promote respiratory
rate normalization.22 The results of this
present study also showed that the lung
compliance (Cstat) and the inflection point
were improved and central inspiratory drive
(P0.1) was decreased, compared with base-
line, which were consistent with the view-
points of the above-mentioned literature.22
The complex critical care ventilator contains
a comprehensive monitor and alarm system
that is a patient safety feature. However,
NIPPV also has some drawbacks. For
example, airway resistance and dead space
are more obvious during NIPPV. The par-
ameters and curves measured cannot fully
reflect the real situation of the patients
because the ventilation tube is not com-
pletely sealed.
The high pressure that can be delivered
by a large complex critical care ventilator
allows operators to use complex modes
when ventilating patients. In this present
study, the Duo PAP þ PSV mode was used
in group C to deal with the `sponge lung
model' of patients with ALI. Computed
tomography scans of lungs with ALI have
shown that lung density increases from the
ventral to the dorsal part, similar to a
sponge soaked with water.23 The air is
progressively extruded out from the basilar
lung area, causing compressive atelectasis
and consolidation. The Duo PAP þ PSV
mode allows patients to breathe spontan-
eously at the alternative two positive pres-
sure levels. Under the Duo PAP mode, there
are two alternative positive pressure phases
that can produce two functional residual
capacities and the difference between the
functional residual capacities drives the
ventilation of patients. Using the active
respiratory valve (which automatically and
dynamically assists spontaneous respiration,
increases the mean airway pressure and
decreases the peak airway pressure), pro-
longs the high functional residual capacity
phase and decreases ventilator-associated
injuries. During NIPPV, using the active
respiratory valve can reduce pulmonary
circulation suppression, open basilar alveoli
effectively and ensure spontaneous respir-
ation, and also reduces the use of deep
sedation and muscle relaxants.
In the retrospective part of the present
study, NIPPV delivered using a complex
critical care ventilator demonstrated simi-
lar efficacy as conventional artificial airway
ventilation in the treatment of a small
subgroup of patients with ARDS. These
findings suggest that using a complex crit-
ical care ventilator to deliver NIPPV could
reduce the use of endotracheal intubation.
More importantly, delivering NIPPV using
a complex critical care ventilator can begin
earlier than artificial airway mechanical
ventilation and has a wider indication
range compared with conventional nonin-
vasive ventilation using a mini-ventilator in
clinical practice.24 Therefore, using a com-
plex critical care ventilator makes it easier
for physicians to decide whether or not to
use noninvasive mechanical ventilation.
For patients with acute hypoxaemic
respiratory failure, early selective NIPPV
treatment can reduce the need for intub-
ation, reduce the risk of severe complica-
tions, improve survival and discharge
rate;11 and is associated with a low inci-
dence of pneumonia and mortality.25 In
addition, patients who accept invasive
mechanical ventilation are at risk of emo-
tional stress because they cannot talk; in
addition, it is often extremely difficult for
them to communicate their needs because
of the presence of an endotracheal tube.
This stress may negatively impact on ven-
tilator weaning and survival.26 The delivery
of NIPPV using a complex critical care
ventilator can relieve such stress because
patients can continue to eat, drink, talk
and expectorate. In patients who survive

following a period of mechanical ventila-
tion, those treated by NIPPV have a
shortened ventilation support time,27
which would be expected to be associated
with a lower consumption of medical
resources.
This present study had a number of
limitations. First, the sample size was rela-
tively small so the evidence should be con-
sidered with caution. Future research to
investigate the potential usefulness of com-
plex critical care ventilators in the delivery
of NIPPV should be undertaken in larger
patient populations. Secondly, the two
groups of patients with ARDS were not
treated during the same time period, so the
results may have been affected by bias.
In conclusion, the findings of this present
study suggest that more satisfactory clinical
outcomes were achieved in the treatment
of patients with ALI when NIPPV was
delivered using a complex critical care
ventilator compared with a conventional
mini-ventilator.
