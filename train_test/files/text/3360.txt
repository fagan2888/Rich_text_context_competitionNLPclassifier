Abstract. The irregularity of land uses and land parcels which constitute the morphology of a
small English town is measured. Form is described by the digitised perimeters and areas of
land-use parcels, and various methods are introduced which relate area to perimeter, and
perimeter to scale, enabling the degree of irregularity to be assessed by means of the concept
of fractal dimension. A theoretical exposition of scale and dimension leads to the definition of
methods for relating area and scale to perimeter, which are then tested using land-use data
for the town of Swindon, Wiltshire. Residential, commercial - industrial, educational, transport,
and open space constitute the range of land uses defined, and three approaches based on
area-perimeter, aggregated perimeter - scale, and individual perimeter - scale regressions are
tested. The methods tested, although well established, are demonstrably inadequate, but some
consistency in gauging the range of irregularity over the set of land uses is presented. It is
suggested that future work be orientated towards more disaggregated measures of land-parcel
irregularity.
Introduction
During the last twenty years, analysis of the regularities in the form of cities has
been largely based on models which identify activities which scale with one another.
Such scaling relations are central to social physics; they are manifest in the way
movement between places is attenuated or scaled inversely with distance, and the way
in which different sized places are clustered in the urban hierarchy. Distance, size,
and frequency are embodied in spatial interaction models of movement and in central
place theory, in which city size is structured around the idea of a rank-size rule.
Hitherto, there has been little emphasis on the meaning of the scale coefficients
associated with such models. In gravitational models, for example, departures from
the inverse square law are defined away as behavioural effects, distinct from the
physical constraints of space. In the last ten years, however, a powerful new
geometry has emerged. This is not only able to interpret scaling relations in a new
light and explain differences from theoretical postulates; it is able to demonstrate
how the regularity posed by Euclidean geometry, with its emphasis on simple
dimensions, can be generalised to embrace the kinds of irregularities empirically
associated both with natural and with artificial realities. Fractal geometry, as it has
been termed by its popularist Mandelbrot (1983), is able to explain many types of
irregular form which have hitherto resisted scientific classification and explanation.
This geometry enables 'order' to be extracted from what has always been considered
'chaos', and it has heralded a new dawn for the age-old study of theories of form.
There are three central constructs to fractal geometry. In essence, the geometry
concerns relationships based on scaling, but with the characteristic that such
relationships are invariant to scale: that is, relationships hold over several orders of
magnitude. The consequence of this first idea is a second one which suggests that
the form of the objects in question is similar over these orders of magnitude. In
short, such objects appear the same when viewed at different scales, typical examples
being rough terrain, branching structures such as trees, cloud formations, and so
on. Fractal objects such as these are called self-similar. The third concept is the
462 M Batty, P A Longley
most powerful and involves dimension. Euclidean geometry deals with the integral
dimensions: 1, 2, 3, and upwards to the higher dimensions. Fractal geometry is
based on noninteger, 'fractional', or as it is now referred to, fractal dimension. The
basis on which an object is fractal or not is its irregularity over scale, and if the
object is self-similar, its form can be captured in the single measure of its fractal
dimension. If such a dimension can be computed with confidence, the objects in
question must clearly manifest self-similarity and scale invariance, albeit usually in
a statistical sense.
The simplest fractals to visualise are those whose dimensions lie between 1 and 2.
The best example is that of a natural boundary such as a coastline which is more
irregular than a straight line of dimension 1, but is clearly less than the area of a
plane which has dimension 2. As such boundaries become more tortuous, the
fractal dimension increases until the curve in question twists and turns to fill the
space available. There are many conundrums in measuring such fractal curves, for
it can easily be shown that the length of such curves depends upon the scale and
sophistication of the measuring device, although the area enclosed by such curves
is always finite. Natural phenomena such as coastlines and man-made boundaries
such as frontiers are both fractals (Richardson, 1961). It is clear that a preliminary
approach to measuring the extent and irregularity of urban areas must begin with
an assessment of the extent to which the boundaries defining such areas are fractal.
In this paper, we will extend our earlier work in measuring such boundaries (Batty
and Longley, 1987a; 1987b) to different urban land uses constituting a medium
sized English town, Swindon, Wiltshire which had a population of 125 000 in
1981. This paper will also embrace an attempt to classify various land uses on the
basis of their fractal dimensions.
There have been many attempts in several disciplines to use fractal geometry to
measure morphologies by defining edges which can be treated as boundaries. In
fine particle science, there is a stream of work based on measuring the irregularity
of two-dimensional outlines (Kaye, 1986). Much work exists in defining the fractal
dimensions of coastlines (Kaproff, 1986) and terrain (Mark and Aronson, 1984), in
the geometry of fracture (Aviles et al, 1987), and in cartographic line generalisation
(Muller, 1987). This is apart from the enormous literature that now exists in the
physics of phase transitions, metereology, the mathematics of iterated functions, and
in computer graphics. We have referenced only those areas which involve the
definition and measurement of identifiable boundaries in the plane, and the literature
cited is the latest we have come across in a long line of related work. Interested
readers are also referred to the review article by Goodchild and Mark (1987) for a
recent survey of applications in spatial analysis.
Methods for determining the fractal dimension, and hence the irregularity of
curves, are comparatively straightforward. Richardson (1961) first demonstrated
the usual method, which consists of measuring the length of a curve at different
scales, and finding the least squares fit of length to scale from which the dimension
is an immediate consequence. However, the method is sensitive to the way length is
measured, and to the number of scales over which the relationship is likely to
hold. We have demonstrated variations and problems in this method in earlier
papers (Batty and Longley, 1987a; 1987b); here we will extend these ideas, but
the main purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which we can associate
different boundaries with different areas, in this case of land uses, based on their
fractal dimensions. An immediate problem which will be raised is the fact that
most land uses share the same boundaries with other land uses; in a system of
contiguous areas like a town, the boundary to each use will always consist of parts
The morphology of urban land use 463
of the boundary of other uses. The convoluted nature of every boundary poses
severe conceptual problems which we will raise, if not resolve, for the first time here.
We will begin by providing a consistent summary of the mathematics of scale
and dimension involving the line and the plane. We will then present two models
of scale dependence, and four methods or algorithms for extracting fractal dimensions
from various boundary data. The application of these methods to land-use boundaries
in Swindon is then presented beginning with a description of the characteristics of
the urban area in question. Fractal dimensions based on area - perimeter relations
across scales are then estimated, and these same dimensions are then derived by
examining scale changes within the digital representation of the perimeters themselves.
Last, individual dimensions of each of the land-use parcels are derived, and
interpretations are made as to the extent to which land uses can be classified on
the basis of their fractal dimensions. The analysis presented is inconclusive, but it
is clear that careful measurement is required in such applications. The sensitivity
of the analysis here to measurement differences casts considerable doubt on many of
the applications presented so far in a variety of fields. Directions for further
research are then indicated.
The mathematics of scale and dimension
In Euclidean geometry, the measure of size in a given dimension will scale directly
with the measure in another (for example, adjacent) dimension; this scaling will be
some product of the dimensions themselves. Consider area A and volume V based
on two dimensions and three dimensions, respectively. Area has a size calculated
as the square of the line measure P, that is P2, and volume has a size P3. If it is
required to derive area from volume, it is clear that this can be done as A °c V2S.
In the same way, if it is required to derive the base line P, which we will hence-
forth call perimeter, from area A, the relation is
P*A1/2. (1)
All relationships such as those implied by equation (1) show that size in one
dimension can be scaled directly if one knows the dimension of the object in a
higher or lower dimension. For example, if A = jtr2, the area of a circle with
radius r, P °c 7ir, and so on for a variety of regular forms. These types of relation
appear widely in the natural sciences where they form an essential part of the
study of relative growth, or allometry (Gould, 1966). If the relationship between
line and area is as postulated in equation (1), this is the condition of isometry. If
the power of A were greater than \, this would be positive allometry, if less, this
would be negative allometry.
Let us now define the area at a given scale n as An
. If area is regarded as a
measuring device for the perimeter, now called Pn
, when the scale is increased to
n+1, it is clear that
*n+l ^ [A 1/2
(2)
because more and more scaled detail about the boundary will be picked up. In
fact, the conundrum emerges that, in the limit as n -* °o, the ratio of areas in
equation (2) will converge, but the ratio of the perimeters will continue to increase.
From equation (1) it is clear that, to derive P from A, area must be rescaled by a
parameter which is greater than 1 but less than 2. That is
P °c {A1/2)D = ADa , (3)
where 1 < D < 2. If D = 2, then perimeter would scale up as area, which would
464 M Batty, P A Longley
imply that area be defined as a space-filling curve, a physically impossible
realisation for the kinds of systems dealt with here. If D = 1, perimeter would not
scale more than the basic unit of measurement which would imply that no scale
effects were present as area increased. The coefficient D is known as the
Hausdorff-Besicovitch or fractal dimension (Mandelbrot, 1983). In this context it
serves as an empirical measure of how much the curve in question departs from a
straight line, thus indicating how 'crinkled' or tortuous the boundary across the
space is. The relation in equation (3) is known as the area-perimeter relation and
it clearly implies a way of estimating the value of D (Lovejoy, 1982).
There is another way of showing how perimeter is related to the scale of
measurement. Consider a scale defined by a unit Axn
, where this is the basic unit
used to define the perimeter Pn
. When Axn
is used to define the perimeter, it
yields Nn
chords such that Pn
= Axn
Nn
. Assume that the scale is now halved, so
that Axn+1
= hAxn
. This scale then yields Nn+l
chords, but, as finer detail is
picked up, Pn+1
> Pn
, which implies that
% * > 2 , while - ^ " = 2 . (4)
Equation (4) shows that halving the scale yields more than twice the number of
chords or line segments.
To derive Nn+1
, hence Pn+i
, from Axn+l
, we can write equation (4) as
Nn+1
Ax, D
Nn
\Axn+1
l
where D > 1 in the given case. Equation (5) can also be written as
p \D
(5)
Nn+l
= -- n - \ , (6)
\Axn+1
;
but, as Pn
can be regarded as a base-level constant (a previous estimate of the
perimeter), equation (6) can be simplified to
A U = A A ^ . (7)
The perimeter Pn+l
is now calculated from equation (7) as
= AA*,,1;/>. (8)
More generally, the relation between any perimeter P and its scale Ax can be
written as
P O C A J C 1 " 0 . (9)
We thus have two relationships for P, one in terms of area, as in equation (3), and
one in terms of scale, as in equation (9). Combining these gives
p oc AD/1 °c Axl~D . (10)
It is tempting to try to equate these by considering how A relates to the scale, Ax.
However, it is not possible to do this in general, for it is only meaningful in special
cases where the geometry is known or assumed.
Besides the area-perimeter, and perimeter-scale relations, there is a third which
could be used to estimate the fractal dimension, D. This is the number-area rule,
known as Korcak's law (Mandelbrot, 1977; 1983). It relates the number of or
The morphology of urban land use 465
fraction of areas, F[A), with an area greater than A, to the area itself as
F(A) oc A~D/2 . (11)
We will not use equation (11) in the sequel for it requires a much larger number of
areas (in this case, land-use parcels) than the level of resolution of the example we
have chosen permits. Nevertheless, there may be circumstances amongst the kinds
of applications described here where it might be useful.
Determining irregularity through the estimation of fractal dimension
The area - perimeter and perimeter - scale relations in equations (3) and (9),
respectively, are both power laws, the parameters of which can be estimated by
means of least squares regression on their logarithmic transformations. However,
the data for these estimations are quite different. For the area - perimeter relation,
it would in theory be possible to measure the area and perimeter of an irregular
object at different scales and perform the regression on these measurements; but
the relation is more suited to estimation with a series of areas and perimeters
associated with a set of objects, all of different sizes. If the relationship holds over
many scales, more scaling detail will be picked up in larger objects than in smaller
ones. In contrast, the perimeter-scale relation is best estimated by calculating
perimeter lengths at different scales for the same object. Later in the paper, we
will explore the consequences of these two methods and note some of the conceptual
difficulties resulting from their comparison. In the rest of this section, however, we
will concern ourselves solely with their estimation and with techniques for measuring
the effects of scale.
First, we will write the area - perimeter relation in equation (3) as
P=0AfW (12)
where </> is a constant of proportionality and t(D) is some power function involving
the fractal dimension D, in this case f(D) = \D. Taking logs of equation (12) gives
l n P = ln^ + f(X>)lnA , (13)
where, in the case of equation (3), ln^ is the intercept and i(D) = \D is the slope
of the regression line of the log of perimeter on the log of area. Clearly, the slope
f(D) can take different functional forms from which D can always be derived, given
an estimate of the slope. The perimeter - scale relation in equation (9) can also be
generalised as
P = AAx«W , (14)
where A is a constant of proportionality and g(D) a power function, which in terms
of equation (9) is g(Z>) = 1-D. Taking logs of equation (14) gives
lnP = lnA + g(D)lnAx, (15)
where In A is the intercept and g(D) = 1-D is the slope of the regression of the
log of perimeter on the log of scale.
The conventional fractal model based on the use of equation (3) in equation (13)
and equation (9) in equation (15), has a linear form, which implies that D is scale-
invariant. However, in some contexts, it can be hypothesised that dimension itself
might vary with scale or area and, in this case, the linear form would be more
complex. We have used a second model based on the notion that fractal dimension
does vary systematically with scale to model the perimeter-scale relations for the
boundaries of urban development in the town of Cardiff (Batty and Longley, 1987b).
466 M Batty, P A Longley
These models will also be tested here. In the case of the area-perimeter relation,
the fractal dimension D can be hypothesised as f(D) = y^c+dA) which when used
in equation (13) gives
InP = Inf + hcXnA+hMlnA . (16)
In equation (16), the coefficient \c has an analogous role to \D in equation (3) as
applied to equation (13). The third term on the right-hand side of equation (1.6) is
a dispersion factor which measures the nonlinearity of the area - perimeter relation.
It is also clear that, as d -*- 0, c -+ D and equation (16) collapses back to the
logarithmic transformation of equation (3).
For the perimeter-scale relation, the hypothesis becomes g(D) = 1-D = a+bAx,
where D is a linear function of the scale Ax. Using this in equation (15) gives
InP = InX + alnAx+bAxlnAx. (17)
As b -* 0, (1 -a)·-· D and equation (17) collapses back to the logarithmic
transformation of equation (9) in equation (15). The third term on the right-hand
side of equation (17) is a dispersion factor, again measuring the nonlinearity of the
perimeter - scale relation, and thus acting as a kind of weighted entropy modulating
the effect of the fractal dimension. In some contexts involving research into the
stability of dimensions across scales, it has been postulated that the data are best
fitted by a multifractal model in which several distinct regression lines can be
discerned. In short, various ranges of scale are reflected by different dimensions
(Kaye et al, 1985; Orford and Whalley, 1983). The model implied by equations (16)
and (17) is the logical consequence of this multifractal specification (Suzuki, 1984).
In the rest of the paper, this model based on the systematic variation of dimension
with area or scale will be referred to as the modified model in contrast to the
conventional model of equations (3) and (9) where dimension is scale-invariant.
Estimating D for the two models from the area - perimeter relations in
equations (13) and (16) is straightforward. For each land parcel, the area and
perimeter can be easily measured and form the dependent and independent
variables, respectively. The number of parcels in the study obviously affects the fit
of the regression, and it may be necessary to identify and exclude outliers. However,
the variation in scale within the observations forming the data set is only influenced
by the prior selection of land parcels, not by any peculiarity of the area-perimeter
measurement.
In contrast, the perimeter - scale relations depend upon the choice of scale and
the measurement of the perimeter associated with that scale for each individual
object. In this case, we will form aggregate perimeters from more than one land
parcel in the first instance. We have used four methods which enable these
measurements to be made. These methods are examined in detail elsewhere
(Longley and Batty, 1986), but they will be summarised here. The most accurate
and time-consuming method involves traversing the perimeter of the object at
different scales by 'walking' a pair of dividers set at an appropriate scale around
the perimeter, thus enabling the perimeter to be derived as a function of the number
of chords generated, Nn
, and the divider length, Axn
, used; that is, Pn
= Axn
Nn
.
This method was first used by Richardson (1961) to derive the log-log plots of
perimeter versus scale, as implied by equation (15); these graphs have been
subsequently called 'Richardson plots' by Kaye (1978) who also refers to the
method as the structured walk, Richardson used a literal, hence manual, version of
this method but here we are able to simulate the walk with a computer algorithm
similar to that suggested by Shelby et al (1982).
The morphology of urban land use 467
The structured walk is time-consuming because it involves a trigonometric
interpolation between the digitised points on the perimeter, to determine the
location of the start and end points of each chord which approximate the perimeter
at the given scale. To reduce the computer time required, a second method
suggested by Kaye and Clark (1985), which they refer to as the equipaced polygon
method, involves computing the approximation to the perimeter from chords based
on successive sequences of every second, or third, or fourth (and so on) point
defining the base-level perimeter. The chords at any level of aggregation are thus
not equal to one another, but the aggregation is very quick. It is argued that this
method enables deep fissures as well as heavily digitised sections of the base-level
perimeter to be more clearly detected than by the structured walk method, since it
takes account of the original digitisation of points which are rarely equally spaced.
A third method which we call the hybrid walk method was first suggested by
Clark (1986) as a compromise between the time-consuming structured walk and the
quicker equipaced polygon method. As in the structured walk method, a divider
length or scale, AJC, is fixed, but instead of interpolation of each chord onto the
original base-level perimeter, the chord is fixed by approximating its end point as
the nearest point on the original curve.
The fourth and final method is based on approximating the perimeter by means
of a grid of cells whose spacing is set at different scales over the range of scales
adopted. At each scale, the perimeter is calculated by counting the number of
cells which are astride the original curve, and it is thus called the cell count method
(Goodchild, 1980). This is the only method in which scale aggregation is consistent
over the entire area and perimeter of the object. In essence, it approximates the
original curve by rasterised images at different scales, whereas the other three methods
use the original curve to fix the scale at different levels. The cell count method is
thus the least accurate with respect to the resolution of the original object, but is
the most consistent with respect to objective scale aggregation.
There are three additional features characterising the use of these methods.
First, with N points defining the base-level curve, the perimeter values obtained
are not independent of their starting point. Thus, each method has been applied
by starting at each of the N digitised points and forming an average perimeter
value from the N perimeter estimates obtained. For boundaries with several
thousand points, a method such as the structured walk can take several hours of
cpu time on a VAX 11/780 machine if an average perimeter is required for each
scale. As we have had sole access to such a machine for several days at a time
this has not constituted a problem; further details of these aspects of this kind of
simulation are given in Longley and Batty (1986).
Second, from each starting point, none of the methods will close exactly on the
first and last points in the base-level curve. A fraction of the chord length will
usually remain, and thus, in all applications, we have added these fractions to the
perimeter values.
Third, the range of aggregations used varies from scales which are fixed at the
average chord length of digitised base-level data up to the value of the maximum
spanning distance between any separate sets of points on the original object, this
maximum being known as Feret's diameter (Kaye, 1978). Within this range, with a
given number of aggregations to perform, the scales are determined in geometric
progression so that they will be equally spaced with respect to the logarithmic
regression.

Applications to urban land use: the area-perimeter relations
Swindon, Wiltshire, the town chosen for analysis, is located in south central
England about 70 miles west of London. The town is quite compact and not
affected in its form by any rapidly growing nearby towns. It has a reasonably
buoyant economy which in the 1960s was a result of its designation as an expanded
town, taking overspill population from Greater London. More recently, its
favoured location in a rapidly expanding area of southern England has led to the
location of new service and high-technology industries in and around the town
itself. Figure 1 shows land use in the town in 1981. It is clear that, as the town
has grown, it has absorbed villages in its immediate periphery. Figure 1 was
compiled as a fairly aggregated land-use map from diverse data sources: remotely
sensed data and local authority map records used by Rickaby (1987) as part of his
studies into the energy requirements of small towns.
The five land uses--residential, commercial - industrial, educational, transport,
and open space--shown in figure 1 constitute the basic data for this study. The
map was digitised with the Map Manager software (Bracken et al, 1987) and the
land parcels were extracted in polygon form by means of conventional digital
cartographic techniques in software developed by the authors. Figure 2 shows the
polygons which constitute the land parcels; they are drawn to scale and classified
according to the five land uses, but they are not arranged in any particular order.
When one observes how these parcels fit together to form the overall map, the
conundrum raised earlier relating to contiguous boundaries between different uses
is immediately apparent. For example, the largest land parcel of all is part of the
set of residential land uses shown in figure 2. In one sense, this parcel can be
considered as the skeleton of the entire town, but it is clear that about half its

The morphology of urban land use · * 469
boundary is common with other land uses; this raises the conceptual difficulty of
making comparisons of the irregularity and form of this boundary with that of
adjacent land uses. For the moment, we will assume that the different parcels can
be treated separately, and we will pursue the estimation in this manner before
commenting further on the problem later in this paper.
Some characteristics of the digital representation of the five land uses are
presented in table 1. There is considerable variation in the set of land uses and it
is clear that no generalisations can be made about educational land use which
comprises only three parcels; and there are limits to how far one can make
inferences about the transport land use which comprises only six parcels. However,
an examination of the average chord length of these data, which ranges from
0.7266 to 0.8375 base-level units, indicates that the base-level digitisation is fairly
independent of land-use type. The number of digitised points given in table 1 for
each land use and for the total involves the double counting of common boundaries
referred to above, in that the points which are common to any pair of land uses
are included in each land use.
Of the 6059 points which constitute the total number of points in each of the
distinct land uses, there are only 2335 points which are not common to adjacent
land-use boundaries. The remaining 3724 points which are common to various
pairs of land uses are in fact counted twice (for each land use in each pair) and
thus there are 1862 points which are common in the data set. In total, there are
4197 distinct points in the set, 43% of these being common to adjacent land uses.
In terms of the individual uses, 51% of the points defining the residential parcels are
common to other uses, whereas over 90% of the points referring to open space are
part of the boundaries of other land uses. These percentages, shown in table 1,
give some indication of the position of the land uses within the town. For example,

470 M Batty, P A Longley
most of the open space is enclosed within the town itself, not on its edge, whereas
educational land use is mainly on the town's edge. In table 1, the perimeter length
refers to the sum of all the perimeters relating to a given land use and the Feret
diameter represents the maximum spanning distance found amongst the parcels of
any given land use. It is clear from this and from figure 2 that there is some
considerable variation among land-use parcels with respect to size.
We are now in a position to estimate the first set of fractal dimensions based on
the area - perimeter relation. In figure 3, the log-log plots of perimeter against
area are presented as scatter diagrams for each of the five sets of land uses in
turn, and then for all five land uses making up the seventy-two land parcels in the
town. These plots demonstrate strong relationships between perimeter and area,
and it is difficult to detect any significant nonlinearity in their form. To these data
we have fitted the conventional model based on using equation (3) in equation (13),
which we can restate as
l n P = l n ^ + i D l n A , (18)
and the modified model given earlier in equation (16), which we will also repeat
for convenience as
InP = Infc + ^clnA+^dA^lnA (19)
Note that we now distinguish the intercept terms in equations (18) and (19) as <f>x
and <j>2
, respectively.
The results of these regressions are presented in table 2. With the exception of
educational land use where there are only three observations, the adjusted R2
(correlation) statistics for both sets of models are acceptable. There are no obvious
outliers, for example, whose removal might improve these statistics. The modified
model gives a slight improvement over the conventional one, but this is not
significant. The fractal dimensions in the conventional model are as postulated,
that is, 1 < D < 2, with the exception of the educational land use which we must
exclude from serious analysis. Interpretations of the parameter c in the modified
model are problematic because of the size of d. As d -+ 0, it is hypothesised that
c -» D, but none of these results show any meaning in these terms in contrast to
some previous work of the authors (Batty and Longley, 1987b). The conventional
model is the only one acceptable here and excluding education, the analysis suggests
that the commercial-industrial {D ~ 1.47) and transport land uses (D ~ 1.44) have
more tortuous boundaries than those of residential (D ~ 1.33) and open space
(D ~ 1.24). The dimension associated with all the land uses (D ~ 1.29) is clearly
an average. All these results are consistent with other estimates from aerial data

Estimation using aggregated perimeter-scale relations
Before we introduce the analysis based on perimeter-scale relations, it is worth
discussing the degree of irregularity associated with different land-use patterns as
we perceive them in a priori terms. In examining the five land uses, we might
argue that open space is more likely to be defined according to the boundaries
imposed by natural terrain, in contrast to more artificially determined land uses
such as the commercial-industrial and transport uses. Residential land use is
likely to have a degree of irregularity in its form somewhere between these
extremes, as might educational use. With respect to the area - perimeter relations,
this a priori ranking of open space, residential, educational, commercial-industrial,
transport is not borne out at all by the fractal dimensions. Indeed, table 2 implies
somewhat the reverse, but the Rh are lower than anticipated and it is possible that
area-perimeter relations do not capture scale effects to the same precision as
methods based on perimeter-scale relations.
However, to be consistent with the area-perimeter analysis, it is necessary to
devise a way of determining single fractal dimensions for each set of land parcels
according to land-use types. In a later section, we will look at the variation in
fractal dimension across land parcels and types, but here we will begin by defining
a global (or total) perimeter for each land-use set. Were we simply to calculate a
single total perimeter for each land use based on all its parcels, and regress these
against scale, this would be similar to our previous analysis as scale would be a
proxy for area. What we have done in fact is to calculate a total perimeter for
each land use by stringing together the individual land-parcel perimeters in the
arbitrary order in which the parcels and their coordinate points have been digitised.
We have also derived a total of total perimeters in the same way which contains all
the points relevant to each land parcel over all land uses.
In figure 4, we show these total perimeters for each of the five land uses. These
are not drawn to the common scales of the parcels contained in figures 1 and 2,
but are scaled up or down to be roughly comparable in area when displayed on a
graphics terminal. It should be quite straightforward to identify the land parcels
from their classification in figure 2. The total perimeters are in fact derived by
centring the first digitised point of each land parcel on a common point and
producing a string of coordinates in the order in which each land use was digitised.
The educational and transport land uses with the fewest land parcels show this
most clearly in figure 4. We have not included the total of total perimeters because
it is not possible to produce a clear and clean plot as a result of the continual over-
lapping of boundaries; we will, however, use this total in the subsequent analysis.
The morphology of urban land use 473
From these base-level perimeters, aggregations across the given range of scales
yielding approximate perimeters provide the data for estimating the parameters of
the perimeter - scale relation. Two issues are important. First, the order and
orientation of the land parcels forming the total perimeter could be crucial, and
second the aggregations should not be so great as to pick up the aggregate shape
of these composite perimeters which is clearly quite arbitrary. Order and orientation
have been varied and this makes little difference to the subsequent results, but the

aggregate shape problem does affect the estimated dimensions. In fact, this leads
to a reestimation of the perimeter - scale relations with a reduced set of aggregations
which will be reported in the next section.
The number and scale of the aggregations for each of these perimeters, which
provide the set of observations for the log-log regressions, are fixed so that each
observation is of equal weight in the estimation. The limits of aggregation for the
structured walk, hybrid walk, and cell count methods are first calculated as follows.
The maximum spanning distance or Feret diameter, F, is computed from
F = max{4,} , where ]
"' . (20)
dtj
= [(x-x^ + iy-yjfr2 ; J
dtj
is the distance between two distinct points referred to as / and j in the base-
level TV-coordinate data set which defines the total perimeter from the coordinate
pairs xt
yt
(i = 1, ..., N). The average chord length, d, in this data set is given as
*-?&· <2i»
where there are N-- 1 chords making up the base-level perimeter.
The sequence of aggregations where d represents the first chord size and F
represents the last, and where m is the number of aggregations, is given by
F = am~ld. (22)
In fact, the starting point is set as the minimum, not average, chord size, and this
can be represented as a fraction, JLL, of d. Therefore, equation (22) becomes
JUF = am~xiid. (23)
The weight a scales one chord size to the next in the sequence of aggregations
and this is computed from equations (22) or (23) as
a = expb^rJ- (24)
This method of aggregating perimeters can only be applied to the structured walk,
hybrid walk, and cell count methods of approximation, for the equipaced polygon
method does not involve distances between points, only the order of points in the
base-level data set.
A similar method of weighting is used, however, involving numbers of base-level
chords, not length based on distances. As the number of base-level chords used to
form a new chord increases, the actual length of the new chord increases and this
is akin to aggregation to larger distance scales. Then, if the number of original
points needed to approximate the coarsest acceptable perimeter is Nm3LX
and the
minimum number Nmin
, the sequence of chord sizes in the sequence of aggregations
is given as
M = a
m~lN · (25)
iymax ** iymin > \^uI
from which a is determined in the same way as previously; that is, as
(lnJVmax
-lnJVmin
^ . *
a = exp . (26)
\ m-\ J
In fact, Nmin
is always 2, and iVmax
is set as N/6, thus implying that the number of
chords defining the most aggregate perimeter is 6; this would make the top level of
The morphology of urban land use 475
The algorithm used to aggregate the original chords on each iteration into new
perimeters uses a in equation (26) only as a guide. Clearly the number of chords
must be integral, not real, thus equation (25) involves truncation or addition to
create integer numbers. The number of aggregated chords on each iteration n+1
is given as Nn+1
= int{aNn
). However, if Nn+1
is equal to Nn
, then Nn+1
is increased
by one chord length, that is Nn+1
= Nn
+ 1. In the application of these algorithms,
we have set m as 100 in each case. In fact, for the equipaced polygon method,
although this also applies, the actual number of aggregations made is always less
than 100 because of the discrete conditional nature of the aggregation.

The observations produced by applying each of these four methods to the five
total perimeters and the total of totals are shown as Richardson plots in figures 5-8.
Before the associated regressions are discussed there are several points to note.
First, there are quite clear upper scale effects caused by aggregation to too high a
level. These are seen as departures from the trend of each graph and as obvious
twists and turns in the tails of some of the plots. Second, these plots show strong
evidence of nonlinearity suggesting, as in previous work (Batty and Longley, 1987b;
Orford and Whalley, 1983), that the modified model, where fractal dimension varies
with scale, is more applicable than the conventional model. Third, the equipaced
polygon method gives cause for concern in that the algorithm attempting equal

weighting does not perform well in establishing equal spacing of observations or in
meeting the fixed number (m = 100) of aggregations; and there are clear twists in
the tails of the associated plots at the higher levels of aggregation. Last, the
aggregation, in the case of educational land use, over 100 levels is problematic in
that there are only 109 digitised points in the total perimeter set as shown in table 1.
We will present the fractal dimensions derived from the conventional and modified
models for all the plots shown in figures 5-8, notwithstanding the fact that the
equipaced polygon method and educational land use are, in the sense just described,
likely to yield unreliable results. In table 3, we show the fractal dimension D
computed from the slope of the regression line, g{D) = 1 -D, as in equation (9)

applied to equation (15) which involves the conventional model; and we also show
the performance of the model in terms of 100 x R2 statistics. In table 4, we show the
same for the modified model as given in equation (17)., In this table, we first give the
fractal dimension D derived from the coefficient a as 1 - a, and then we give the
dispersion coefficient, b, noting of course that as b ~* 0, D ~* 1 -- a.
It is immediately clear from tables 3 and 4 that the modified model in which
dimension is a function of scale gives by far the best performance over all methods
and land uses. Yet the equipaced polygon and hybrid walk methods produce
strange results for the modified model, in that fractal dimensions are less than 1 in
four cases. In the case of the conventional model, these methods also appear to
give D values higher than anticipated. With respect to the ranking of D values

from table 3, there is, however, a fairly consistent order over all methods in which
open space, all land uses, and commercial - industrial have higher fractal dimensions
than residential, which in turn is higher than educational and transport.
A more disordered set of ranks is associated with the modified model, although
there are some similarities with the conventional model results, and in any case,
the dispersion coefficients pick up the nonlinearity in the relations and hence
influence the value of D. In this respect, the dispersion coefficients are quite low
for most land uses. To summarise, then, if the equipaced polygon and hybrid
methods which seem to pick up inappropriate larger scale effects, are ignored, the
structured walk and cell count methods produce a ranking of fractal dimensions
across all land uses (with the exception of educational) according to our a priori
expectations. At this stage, it is even possible to say that variations in dimension
and coefficients between land uses are clearly wider than between methods, and
this implies that the choice of method is less significant than the division into
standard types of land use.

However, the really important point at issue here is the presence of unwanted
and arbitrary scale effects in the data. It is quite clear from figures 5-8 that we
must remove the highest aggregations from all these plots. In doing so, we also
immediately remove some of the nonlinearity from the data, thus hopefully
improving the conventional model estimates as well as resolving some of the
anomalous dimensions evident in tables 3 and 4.
Reestimation of the perimeter-scale relations
The range of aggregations with respect to the structured walk, cell count, and
hybrid walk methods as given in equations (23) and (24) begins with the first and
last chord lengths set as low as 70% of the average distance, d, and Feret
diameter, F, for residential land use, to as high as 99% of d and F for the
educational land use. Shelby et al (1982) recommend that the starting points
should be no lower than \d and Kaye (1978) recommends the end point be no
higher than \F. The lower limits (jud) we have used do not pose any problem, but
the upper limits {juF) yield approximations to the total perimeter with as few as
two chords and only as many as five chords. An approximation to the boundary
of any irregular object can never be made in less than six chords and in the case
where we have up to thirty land parcels forming an aggregated perimeter, it could
be argued that we should never go below 180 chords. Below this level we
unwittingly include scale effects which pick up the arbitrariness of the 'constructed'
perimeters; these are also sensitive to order and orientation of the land-parcel
strings. In terms of this argument, it would appear that we should take an upper
limit no greater than 20% of Feret's diameter, that is ju = 0.2.
From an examination of figures 5-8, it is quite straightforward to determine
cutoff limits at the upper tails of each plot which would remove those observations
clearly sensitive to these unwarranted scale effects. We have defined these cutoff
limits in these figures, showing the number of observations each set has been
reduced to. This varies for the structured walk methods from 9% to 22% of the
original set to as little as between 5% and 10% in the case of the equipaced
polygon methods. From figures 5-8, it is clear that we could impose even harsher
constraints on the observations used, but, although this would probably improve
the results still further, relevant scale effects would probably be removed too.
Tables 5 and 6 show the reestimations of the two models using the four methods
applied to each land use and the total of all land uses. There are marginal
increases in the performance of the conventional model as comparisons between

tables 3 and 5 indicate. There is increased consistency between the methods with
respect to the dimensions estimated, with the exception of the equipaced polygon
method. This is the most volatile of all the methods, with the structured walk
being the most consistent in terms of the original estimation and the reestimation.
With respect to the ranking of land uses by dimension, an even clearer pattern
emerges. Those with the higher fractal dimensions are open space and all land
uses, then commercial - industrial and residential, with much lower dimensions for
educational and transport uses. This bears out the a priori analysis even more
strongly, but it must be noted that the performance of the conventional model is
only just adequate.
The modified model results shown in table 6 are even better than those of
table 4. The ranking pattern is more variable than that of the conventional model
with the commercial-industrial, educational, and open space land uses having the
highest degree of nonlinearity as measured by the dispersion coefficient. The equi-
paced polygon method somewhat ironically perhaps, has by no means the worst
performance, but it still generates coefficients out of line with the other methods.
As with the conventional model, the structured walk provides the most consistent
results over each land use, and together with the cell count method gives the best
performance.
It is now worth summarising all these results with respect to the fractal dimensions
produced. In figure 9, an attempt is made to capture the variations in dimension
obtained across all methods and land uses in a single diagram. Each of the
diagrams shows this variation with respect to the area-perimeter, conventional
perimeter-scale, and modified perimeter - scale methods, the last two being shown
with respect to their original estimation and reestimation. It is quite clear from
these plots that the equipaced polygon method is the most problematic and should
be excluded. Yet the structure of these results does show that there are greater
differences between land uses than between methods, and this bears out the
original hypothesis that such differences can be detected and possibly explained
with respect to the processes governing the formation and evolution of different
land-use activities. We will say more about this in our conclusion, but before we
explore the variations between land parcels, we have averaged the dimensions
produced in the last three sections, and these are shown, together with those of the
subsequent section, in table 7.

The morphology of urban land use 483
It is clear that the area-perimeter method produces quite different results from
the perimeter - scale methods, but that the patterns produced by the perimeter -
scale methods are more robust and consistent with our a priori theorising. For the
conventional model, the fractal dimensions vary from D ~ 1.55 for open space and
all land uses to D - 1 . 4 5 for residential and commercial - industrial to D ~ 1.30
for educational and transport. With respect to the modified model D ~ 1.25 (in its
limit) for open space, all land use, and residential, whereas for the other three land
uses, 1.00 < D < 1.10. This implies that these last three land uses present greater
nonlinearity; that is, their fractal dimensions vary more strongly with scale. These
results mask the wide variation in dimension between land-use parcels within any
land-use type, and do not in any way address the equality of fractal dimension
over common boundaries between different land uses. We will address some of
these questions in the next section.

Fractal dimensions of individual land parcels
Figure 2 shows that there are seventy-two distinct land-use parcels, although in the
previous analysis the inner boundaries of some residential land parcels, where such
boundaries existed, were added to the aggregate perimeters. There are eight such
inner boundaries, all relating to residential land use as shown in figure 2, and in the
subsequent analysis they are treated as separate land parcels, thus augmenting the
number of parcels treated to eighty. First, all four aggregation methods--the
structured and hybrid walks, the equipaced polygon, and the cell count methods-
were applied to each of the eighty parcels, with the number of aggregations structured
in geometric form as implied by equations (21)-(25) but with a fixed and m
varied accordingly.
In the case of the equipaced polygon method, the aggregation of sixteen perimeters
out of the eighty possible yielded too few observations for any subsequent regression.
The other methods produced Richardson plots that were generally more linear than
those shown in figures 5-8 and therefore it was decided to fit the conventional
model to all sets of observations generated. The R2-values ranged from 83.3% to
99.9% in the case of applying the equipaced polygon method, but it was the
structured walk that produced the most consistent plots in contrast to the hybrid
and cell count methods which were more volatile across the land parcels. Some
methods produced dimensions for individual land parcels outside the range
1 < D < 2. It was therefore decided to pursue more detailed analysis and model
fitting using a narrower range of observations taken from the structured walk

method only. In fact, the emphasis in this section is on the variation between land
parcels, not on the variation between methods, hence the choice of the most robust
method to generate the perimeter - scale observations.
The application both of the conventional and of modified models is shown in
figure 10 with respect to their fractal dimensions and associated #2-statistics. The
results for each land parcel are shown in the arbitrary order of figure 2 according
to the way the parcels were digitised but ordered within land-use types as given
previously. All fractal dimensions for the conventional model are in the postulated
range from 1 < D < 2. For the largest land parcels, the dimensions appear higher
than for the rest but a regression of the number of digitised points of all parcels
on their conventional model dimensions yields an i?2-value of only 15.6%. With
respect to the five sets of land uses, these Revalues were more variable, rising to
68.6% in the case of commercial - industrial. But in general, there does not appear
to be a strong bias to higher dimensions for those land-use parcels with the highest
number of perimeter coordinates. Figure 10 also shows that the parameters of the
modified nonlinear model are consistent with the range of 1 < D < 2, and the
level of dispersion reflecting the nonlinearity of each parcel over scale, is fairly
modest in every case.
One way of summarising these parameters and statistics is by computing means
and standard deviations. Table 8 presents these results for both models. The
parameters and dimensions in this table are in their original form as predicted
from the application of equations (15) and (17), that is, the coefficient of the
conventional model is a, a = g(D) = 1 -- D, and the coefficients for the modified
model are a and b, where a -* (1 -- D) as b --> 0 {b is the dispersion parameter).
Table 8 presents the variation in size of the land parcels for each land use and
over the whole set in terms of their mean number of coordinates. The distribution
of these coordinates with respect to the number of land parcels is skewed, with a
much greater proportion of parcels below their mean size. In the case of the
residential parcels, this distribution is highly skewed, largely because of the
existence of the one large parcel which provides the skeletal structure of the town.
The variation in parameters and performance of the models, however, is much
less than the variation in the features of the land parcels themselves. Figure 10
makes this apparent, and these results are averaged for each land use over all
parcels in table 8. With respect to the conventional model, the /?2-values only
range from 93.4% in the case of residential parcels down to 91.9% for transport
and the range with each land use over the land parcels is also quite narrow. The
fractal dimensions D also show a pattern over the land uses which is consistent
with the aggregated perimeter - scale results but is considerably clearer. The ranking
of land uses from largest to smallest D is ordered from residential {D ~ 1.15),
open space (1.13), transport (1.11), commercial - industrial (1.10), and educational
(1.09) with an average over all land uses of 1.13. These values are considerably
smaller than those shown previously, yet they are more in line with previous work
(Batty and Longley, 1987a; 1987b). In fact, the largest residential parcel (see
figure 2) is just one of five parcels which has a dimension greater than 1.20. From
these results it is quite clear that the much higher dimensions produced by the
aggregated perimeter - scale relations are caused by the method of aggregating
individual perimeters into strings of coordinates. It would appear that the aggregation
picks up arbitrary scale effects which are central to the method itself and not the
order or orientation of the individual parcels in the process of forming these
composite perimeters.
The modified model results also shown in table 8 have a wider range of variation
around their mean estimates than those of the conventional model. In terms of the

ranking of the parameter a, the residential, open space and all land-use parcels
have a dimension higher than those of transport, commercial-industrial, and
educational, in that order, although these values are over a narrower range. The
values of the dispersion factors show this order and the i?2-estimates, although
slightly better than those of the conventional model, are not as high as those
produced by the aggregate perimeter - scale relations. Nevertheless, the nonlinear
model is an improvement over the linear and, in general, these results for the
individual parcels are better than originally anticipated.
Conclusions
The analysis presented here is generally inconclusive. At most, it would appear
that residential and open space land uses have a greater degree of irregularity than
commercial-industrial, educational, and transport. There is a logic here which we
spelt out before we began the analysis in that, for land uses which are larger in
scale, there is likely to be less effort put into the geometric control of land under
development. Yet there remains considerable uncertainty over the processes in
operation. We have, however, shown that, in general, scale effects vary with scale
itself, and this is likely to be the result of multiple processes changing their relative
importance through the range of scales. This argument was spelt out by Batty and
Longley (1987b) and is further confirmed here.
We have added to table 7 the results of the last section where the whole range
of models and methods applied throughout this paper are displayed in suitably
'averaged' form. This shows up the arbitrariness of the analysis, with open space
varying from D ~ 1.59 to D ~ 1.13 and residential land use from D ~ 1.46 to
D ~ 1.15 for the linear conventional model. In previous work, the methods them-
selves have been subject to considerable variation, but here despite some mild
association of dimension values with land uses, the main variation concerns the
way area, perimeter, and scale are defined and the type of approach or method
taken.
Questions of scale are never very clear in much fractal analysis, despite the fact
that fractals are defined by scale-invariance. In the area-perimeter method it is
assumed that objects of varying sizes show the effects of varying scale itself
(Woronow, 1981). In short, a small residential development will not pick up the
aggregate scale effects which can be detected by a large-scale development; so

runs the logic. However, this will depend on the base level of resolution in the
first place and there is seldom much discussion of this in the literature. The
method of aggregating perimeters used in the composite perimeter-scale analyses
of land uses, is also suspect because of arbitrary scale effects which can be produced,
despite careful control over the process of aggregation. Last the individual land-
parcel analysis using conventional perimeter - scale, not aggregated relations, suffers
from its very inability to aggregate parcels, other than by arbitrary statistics such as
simple averages.
What is clearly required in future work is a close examination of these approaches
in terms of scale effects. We have paid great attention to problems of denning
scale limits and ranges here, but on reflection, our analysis should have reduced
the range of scales much further. New methods are required which are more
robust than those used here, and we should now accept that in the perimeter - scale
analysis, the hybrid walk and equipaced polygon methods should be abandoned in
favour of methods such as the structured walk and cell count methods whose
properties of aggregation are better understood.
The final conclusion we will draw relates to more substantive questions. Although
we have tackled individual and aggregate analysis here, much finer analysis of the
fractal dimension of parts of perimeter boundaries is required. With k land uses,
there are \k(k+l) possible pairwise boundaries to examine separately. Better
classification of the fractal shapes of land parcels will not emerge until the
common boundary problem is directly broached. This must involve a detailed
examination of how such boundaries are formed and how they evolve over time.
By explaining the development process, more satisfactory explanations can be given
of the way land uses 'stick' to each other to form the whole town. Only by
extending the analysis along these lines can conclusive results about the ways in
which urban morphologies are structured and evolve, be demonstrated.
