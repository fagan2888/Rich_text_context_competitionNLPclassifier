Abstract. The effect of the spatial location of faces in the visual field during brief, free-viewing encoding
in subsequent face recognition is not known. This study addressed this question by tagging three
groups of faces with cheating, cooperating or neutral behaviours and presenting them for encoding in
two visual hemifields (upper vs. lower or left vs. right). Participants then had to indicate if a centrally
presented face had been seen before or not. Head and eye movements were free in all phases. Findings
showed that the overall recognition of cooperators was significantly better than cheaters, and it was
better for faces encoded in the upper hemifield than in the lower hemifield, both in terms of a higher d9
and faster reaction time (RT). The d9 for any given behaviour in the left and right hemifields was similar.
The RT in the left hemifield did not vary with tagged behaviour, whereas the RT in the right hemifield
was longer for cheaters than for cooperators. The results showed that memory biases in contextual
face recognition were modulated by the spatial location of briefly encoded faces and are discussed in
terms of scanning reading habits, top-left bias in lighting preference and peripersonal space.

1 Introduction
The ability to recognize faces is crucial because faces are highly salient and relevant visual stim-
uli in social interactions (Blais, Jack, Scheepers, Fiset, & Caldara, 2008; Bonner, Burton, & Bruce,
2003) and such ability is required across a broad array of exchanges. Information about the behav-
iour and appearance of individuals can be shared among people who have not interacted with each
other directly (e.g. gossip) as face recognition involves the mental tagging of individuals with labels
which are then used as guides in future encounters (Anderson, Siegel, Bliss-Moreau, & Barrett, 2011;
Sommerfeld, Krambeck, Semmann, & Milinski, 2007).
Several studies have addressed the question as to whether we recognize faces of cooperators bet-
ter than faces of cheaters or vice versa, since both types of responses are plausible from an evolu-
tionary point of view: social animals rely on cooperation, but need to detect cheaters efficiently to
avoid exploitation (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981; Trivers, 1971). Such duality is reflected in the com-
plexity of previous results. Some studies showed small biases towards faces of cooperators (Barclay,
2008; Brown & Moore, 2000; Felisberti & Pavey, 2010), whereas others argued that successful social
exchanges require an enhanced recognition of cheaters for subsequent avoidance or punishment (Bar-
clay & Lalumiere, 2006; Cosmides, 1989; Mehl & Buchner, 2008). In addition, a few studies either
failed to find biases in the recognition of cheaters or cooperators (Buchner, Bell, Mehl, & Musch, 2009;
Mehl & Buchner, 2008) or reported biases towards faces associated with threatening rather than cheat-
ing information (Bell & Buchner, 2012). The reasons underpinning the discrepancy in those results are
not clear, but they may be related to the different experimental paradigms used in those studies.
Many social encounters and exchanges involve multiple and simultaneous interactions, whereby
groups of faces are encoded rapidly (e.g. robberies). However, to date, remarkably few studies presented
groups of tagged faces for encoding. Previous studies employed individual face encoding, since during
free-viewing group encoding different parts of the visual field (i.e. fovea and periphery) are stimulated
concomitantly, and perceptual anisotropies in the vertical and horizontal planes have been widely reported
(Christman, 1993; Hillger & Koenig, 1991; Hines, Jordan-Brown, & Juzwin, 1987; Stone & Valentine,
2005; Thomas & Elias, 2011). For example, a left visual field (Luh, Rueckert, & Levy, 1991; Sergent,
1984; Yovea, Tambini, & Brandman, 2008) and an upper visual field (Carlson, Hogendoorn, Fonteijn, &
Verstraten, 2011) advantage has been linked with face processing. Contextual face recognition biases in

the vertical plane might be small and hard to tear apart, since such recognition involves widely distributed
semantic, visual and even emotional processing.
In most of the previous recognition studies faces were not tagged with relevant social informa-
tion and they were presented individually rather than in groups. Given the wide range of reported
perceptual anisotropies, the question as to whether contextual face recognition after group encoding is
affected by such anisotropies remains open.
This study investigated whether the spatial location of tagged faces in the visual field during brief
encoding (10 s/group) affected subsequent face recognition. Due to the brief encoding time, it would
be difficult for participants to split the time equally between the visual hemifields. Based on scanning
studies during the reading of Western languages and biases in lighting preferences, it is predicted that
the recognition of faces encoded in the upper hemifield would be better than faces encoded in the
lower hemifield. On the other hand, if such biases do not modulate the encoding of groups of faces,
memory biases in the horizontal plane should not be observed. Significant anisotropies related to the
right or left visual hemifields were not expected during free-viewing encoding.
2 Methods
2.1
Participants
Participants (N 5 80; 52 females, 28 males; M 5 26 years old, SE 5 1) were recruited via opportunity
sampling at two university premises. Five participants were left-handers, and four participants did not
specify their handedness. No financial compensation was given, but some participants received bonus
course credits. Participants were informed that the experiment was about memory for faces, but no
further experimental details were given. Written consent in accordance with the ethical guidelines of
the British Psychological Society and as approved by the university ethics committee was given by
participants prior to testing. Participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
2.2
Materials
An equal number of photographs of male and female faces (N 5 24) was selected from the XM2VTS
database. The colour, frontal head-shot photographs (227 3 181 pixels) stood against a dark blue
background and had neutral expressions. In a pilot study (N 5 6), half of the faces were judged to
belong to actors aged over 35 years old and the other half to actors aged between 18 and 30 years old.
The faces were associated with one of three behaviours: cooperator, cheate, or neutral. Twelve faces
had to be memorized in groups of four faces (Figure 1), which were presented in one of four positions
in the visual field: upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right. Each face set contained two males
and two females. The remaining 12 faces were used in the recognition test.
The faces in each of the three categories varied across some of the participants (e.g. the "coop-
erator" in one test could be the "cheater'" in another one). Faces were allocated to one of the three
behaviour groups using a simple randomization procedure (www.random.org).
Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the "old (yes)/new (no)" recognition test. Three sets of faces were memorized
in conjunction with behaviours linked to descriptions of cheating, cooperation and neutral behaviours. A brief
consolidation task (multiplications) followed the encoding phase. Afterwards, a memory test was presented
whereby participants saw a face and had to answer whether they had seen that face before or not.

The viewing angle was approximately 7 3 6 degrees at 60 cm from the centre of the monitor.
E-Prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) was used to design and present the face
recognition test.
2.3
Procedure
After reading and signing the consent forms, participants were told that the experiment would be test-
ing their memory for faces. Participants were tested individually and according to the following core
experimental protocol: (i) encoding of 12 faces with correspondent behaviours; (ii) distracter task
during memory consolidation (10 multiplications); and (iii) "yes­no" face recognition test (48 trials:
24 faces--12 encoded and 12 new ones--in two cycles of trials).
In the encoding phase, a screen introduced the social scenario, followed by another screen with
a behaviour. The information about people was obtained indirectly, i.e. participants did not suffer
any direct financial loss. The template for the conditional rule was of the form: "If you take benefit
P, then you must satisfy condition Q." Note that the descriptors did not contain the words "cheater,"
"cooperator" or "neutral."
The introductory screen in the program read: "Before you continue, it is important to know that
John is a successful businessman. Through his hard work, he has managed to build a very good life
for himself and his family. He is also quite generous. He is willing to help out his long-time friends by
offering them loans when needed. In the next three screens, you will meet John's friends. Press any
key to continue." The following screen read: "You will see three groups of people. The groups have
different behaviours, which are specified in a screen before their photos. Press any key to continue."
Before the participants saw the groups of faces, the tags for cooperators, cheater, or neutrals were
introduced. The tags contained the following information:
·
"This group of friends borrowed £25,000 from John and paid it back with interest within a year;"
· "This group of friends borrowed £25,000 from John and never paid it back;"
· "This group of friends did not borrow money from John."
The time allowed for reading the tags was not restricted; when participants finished reading them,
they simply pressed a key or clicked the mouse to move to the next screen, which contained the four
faces to be memorized in conjunction with the previous behaviour. The four faces in each of the groups
(e.g. cheaters, cooperator, and neutrals) were displayed around a centred fixation point (two faces on
top and two below it). The faces were spaced from each other by approximately 0.2 degree of visual
angle. The duration of encoding for each group of four faces was restricted to 10 s and participants
were free to move their eyes.
The order of encoding of the groups was randomized and counterbalanced as optimally as pos-
sible: 27 participants encoded cooperators first; 26 participants encoded cheaters first and 27 partici-
pants encoded neutrals first. The encoding order of the second group of participants was as follows:
25 encoded cooperators, 29 encoded cheaters and 26 encoded neutrals. Finally, the encoding order of
the third group of participants was as follows: 27 encoded cooperators, 25 encoded cheaters and 28
encoded neutrals.
The encoding of faces and correspondent behaviour was followed by a memory consolidation
phase, which consisted of a series of multiplications that lasted between 2 and 5 minutes. Answers
were entered with the keyboard and feedback after each trial was provided.
The recognition test started with a black fixation cross presented on a blank screen for 1 s. It was
followed by another screen with a face and the question "Have you seen this face before?" Half of the
faces had been memorized in the encoding phase, and half of the faces were new faces, absent from the
encoding phase. Participants answered by pressing a key (1 5 yes; 2 5 no). Feedback was provided
after each trial. To continue to the next trial, participants just pressed any key or clicked the mouse.
Two cycles of 24 faces (12 tagged and memorized, 12 new) were presented in randomized order to
each participant (N 5 48 trials). The whole procedure lasted approximately 20 minutes.
2.4
Data analysis
Participants' performance was measured as response sensitivity (d9) and reaction time (RT) for cor-
rect responses (range: 100 ms and 10,000 ms); an adjustment was used when the hit rate was 100%,
to avoid infinite d9 values (Green & Swets, 1974; Hautus, 1995; Macmillan & Creelman, 2004). The
repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) had the descriptors tagged to faces (cooperator,
Spatial location of encoding affects face recognition 355
cheater, neutral) and the visual hemifields (upper vs. lower or left vs. right) as the within-subject
factors. The dependent variables were the d9 and the RT. The performance or quadrant was not ana-
lysed statistically due to the relatively small sample size or quadrant/behaviour. Greenhouse­Geisser
adjustments to the degrees of freedom were performed when sphericity could not be assumed (Mauchly's
sphericity test). All pair wise comparisons were carried out using Bonferroni adjustments. Partial eta-
squared (p2) was used to refer to effect size.
3 Results
This experiment was designed to investigate whether the spatial location of faces during encoding
affected the subsequent face recognition task. As mentioned previously, groups of four faces were
tagged with one of three behaviours (cooperators, cheaters or neutrals). All faces in a group were
presented simultaneously for encoding (10 s/group), but each face was presented in a different visual
quadrant (upper left, upper right, lower left, or lower right).
The analysis of the d9 across all visual quadrants showed significant differences related to the
behaviour tagged to the faces (F (2, 158) 5 7.01, p 5 0.001, p2 5 0.08), whereby the mean sensitivity
for cheaters (d9 5 1.51, SE 5 0.11) was lower than for cooperators (d9 5 1.79, SE 5 0.10, p 5 0.03)
and neutrals (d9 5 1.86, SE 5 0.17, p , 0.001).
The response latency also differed according to the behavioural tags. Six participants were
removed from the analysis due to mean RT values outside the analysed range (100­10,000 ms). A
significant interaction between behaviour and hemifield was observed (F (2, 146) 5 5.13, p 5 0.007,
p2 5 0.07). Participants were faster at recognizing cooperators (M 5 1,027 ms, SE 5 29) than cheat-
ers (M 5 1,126 ms, SE 5 35, p 5 0.003), but not neutrals (M 5 1,073 ms, SE 5 38, p 5 0.48). RT for
cheaters and neutrals was statistically similar.
The d9 and RT for tagged faces encoded in the upper-left and lower-left quadrants were aggre-
gated into a left ("Le") hemifield, whereas data from the upper-right and lower-right quadrants were
aggregated into a left ("Ri") hemifield. Equally, data from the upper-right and upper-left quadrants
were aggregated into an upper ("Up") hemifield and the data encoded in the lower-right and lower-left
quadrants were aggregated into a lower ("Lo") hemifield.

3.1.1 Response sensitivity (d9)
A significant interaction was observed between behavioural tag and the two encoding hemifields
(F (2, 158) 5 16.57, p , 0.001, p2 5 0.20). The d9 for cooperators encoded in the Up hemifield
(d9 5 2.21, SE 5 0.11) was higher than in the Lo hemifield (d9 5 1.42, SE 5 0.14, p , 0.001). The
inverse occurred with the d9 for cheaters, which was lower in the Up (d9 5 1.30, SE 5 0.13) than in the
Lo (d9 5 1.71, SE 5 0.13, p , 0.001) hemifield. The d9 for neutral faces was statistically similar in
both hemifields (d9

Lo
5 1.99, SE 5 0.12, p 5 0.13) (Figure 2a).
Pairwise comparisons between faces encoded in the Up hemifield showed that participants were
more sensitive to cooperators than cheaters (p , 0.001) and neutrals (p 5 0.002). Such difference was
not observed in the Lo hemifield, where d9 for cheaters was slightly higher than for cooperators, but
not significantly (p 5 0.06).
The effect of the encoding order on d9 was also investigated with a repeated measures ANOVA: 3
behavioural tags 3 4 hemifields 3 6 encoding orders (permutation of cooperators, cheaters and neu-
trals). No significant interaction between encoding order and tags was observed (F (9.32, 137.99) 5
1.49, p 5 0.15). Likewise, there was no significant interaction of encoding order with tags and visual
hemifields (F (30, 444) 5 0.94, p 5 0.57).
3.1.2
RT
There was a significant interaction between behavioural tags and hemifield of encoding (F (2, 146) 5
6.99, p 5 0.001, p2 5 0.09), but only for neutral faces, which were recognized faster in the Lo (M 5
977 ms, SE 5 35) than in the Up hemifield (M 5 1,168 ms, SE 5 57, p 5 0.001). There were no
reliable differences between the Up and Lo hemifields for cheaters (MUp
5 1,133 ms, SE 5 41 and
(MLo
5 1,120 ms, SE 5 45) or cooperators (MUp
5 1,010 ms, SE 5 45 and MLo
5 1,047 ms, SE 5 33)
(Figure 2c).
Pairwise comparisons of RT between faces encoded in the Up hemifield showed that cooperators
were recognized faster than cheaters (p 5 0.006) and neutrals (p 5 0.005). For faces encoded in the
356 Felisberti F M, McDermott M R

0.03), but RT for cheaters and cooperators was similar.

(Figure 2b).
3.2.2
RT
A significant interaction between tags and hemifield of encoding was recorded (F (2, 146) 5 8.71,
p , 0.001, p2 5 0.11). The RT in the Le hemifieds was similar for all behaviours: cheaters (M

5 1,057 ms, SE 5 39) and neutrals (MLe
5 1,068 ms, SE 5 45).
In contrast, the RT in the Ri hemifield varied with the tagged behaviour; the recognition of cooperators
was faster than cheaters (p , 0.001) and neutrals (p 5 0.02): cheaters (MRi
5 1,203 ms, SE 5 45),
cooperators (MRi
5 991 ms, SE 5 38) and neutrals (MRi
5 1,109 ms, SE 5 49) (Figure 2d).
4 Discussion
This study investigated the effect of the spatial location of tagged faces during brief, free-viewing
encoding in a subsequent face recognition task.
Participants were faster and more sensitive to faces tagged as cooperators or neutrals than faces
tagged as cheaters, which is in line with previous studies showing biases towards cooperators when
their proportion in the population was similar to the proportion of cheaters (Barclay, 2008; Felis-
berti, Cox, Wanli, & Dover, 2013; Felisberti & Pavey, 2010; Yarmey, 1993). In contrast, Chiappe and
colleagues (2004) reported a better accuracy for cheaters than cooperators using a scenario similar
to the one used in this study. However, like in this study they also reported that participants looked
longer at cheaters than cooperators. Some differences in the two experimental designs make it difficult
to explain some of the contradictory results. For example, in their study, faces were encoded indi-
vidually, encoding time was not restricted, and the rules of the social contract were explicit, whereas
in this study, no social contract rule was specified, encoding time was restricted to 10 s, faces were

presented in groups and the tags did not contain explicit words related to moral aspects of the behav-
iours described.
Differences in d9 and RT linked to the hemifield of encoding were recorded for the first time. The
recognition of cooperators was markedly better than of cheaters and neutrals when faces had been
encoded in the upper hemifield, whereas no differences in d9 were observed for faces encoded in the
lower hemifield. It is possible that participants' scanning patterns during reading (Heath, Rouhana,
& Ghanem, 2005; Megreya & Havard, 2011; Sakhuja, Gupta, Singh, & Vaid, 1996) affected face
encoding and subsequent recognition. In such case, faces in the upper hemifield would have had more
encoding time than faces in the lower hemifield, since the group encoding was restricted to 10 s and it
would have been difficult to allocate an equal share of time to each of the four faces in the group. In
addition, the three groups of faces were interleaved with written behavioural descriptors, which could
have acted as priming or masks. In pilot studies from this lab, contextual memory biases were attenu-
ated or eliminated when faces were encoded individually rather than in groups and encoding time was
raised to up to 9 s/face. Further studies are being carried out to confirm those preliminary results.
As mentioned previously, the order of face encoding was randomized and counterbalanced, but
the overall advantage for cooperators over cheaters was observed independently of whether coopera-
tors were the first, second or third group to be encoded. Furthermore, in a larger study (N 5 153; under
review), we showed a similar advantage for cooperators over cheaters even when the encoding order
was fixed.
The findings in this study are also in line with the results showing a right-upper advantage in face
matching tasks (Hagenbeek & Van Strien, 2002). They are also in line with the results from Raymond
(2002), who reported an advantage for information encoded in the upper hemifield for branded images
in relation to non-branded ones. Indeed, an advantage of the upper hemifield for visual encoding has
been proposed by Previc (1990), whereby images viewed above the point of gaze would be prefer-
entially associated with perceptual categorization and an "offline" analysis and storage of images,
whereas images viewed below the point of gaze would be linked to the ongoing motor control of one's
limbs (e.g. "online" processing).
In addition to the idea of anisotropies related to one's reading habits and peripersonal space,
the advantage of visual processing in the upper hemifield may be also linked to prior visual knowl-
edge about the environment (e.g. light comes from overhead). Such knowledge seems to be used
to disambiguate scenes and leads to processing biases towards upper, left-lit stimuli (Gerardin, de
Montalembert, & Mamassian, 2007; Mamassian & Goutcher, 2001).
The d9 for cooperators, cheaters and neutrals encoded in the left or the right hemifields was simi-
lar, since visual scanning in the horizontal plane is a more common task during reading than the scan-
ning in the vertical plane. The lack of left versus right encoding differences in relation to the same
behaviour may be related to the fact that both semantic and visual processing play a fundamental role
in contextual face recognition, which activates different systems in the right and left hemispheres
(Goel, Shuren, Sheesley, & Grafman, 2004). In addition, bilateral face processing has been shown to
be more prominent in females (Bourne & Hole, 2006; Proverbio, Riva, Martin, & Zani, 2010), who
were the majority of the participants in this study.
The spatial anisotropies in face recognition results did not explain why cheaters were not remem-
bered as well as cooperators and neutrals, but they showed that contextual face recognition was flex-
ible and finely tuned not only to changes in the social context but also to changes in the spatial location
in which faces were encoded.
The findings indicate that the spatial location of faces during brief, free-viewing encoding modu-
lated contextual face recognition significantly in the horizontal visual plane. The findings in this study
are particularly relevant to cases where several faces are encoded in a brief period of time (e.g. eye
witness cases). The results are likely to reflect participants' scanning patterns associated with reading,
top-left bias in lighting preference and/or the perception of their peripersonal space.
