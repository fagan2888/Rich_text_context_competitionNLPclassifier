Abstract: A large body of research has revealed that nutrition and physical activity influence
brain functioning at various stages of the life course. Nevertheless, very few studies have
explored whether diet and exercise influence verbal intelligence as youth transition from
adolescence into young adulthood. Even fewer studies have explored the link between these
health behaviors and verbal intelligence while accounting for genetic and environmental
factors that are shared between siblings. Employing data from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health, the current study uses a sample of same-sex twin pairs to test
whether youth who engage in poorer fitness and nutritional practices are significantly more
likely to exhibit reduced verbal intelligence during young adulthood. The results suggests
that, independent of the effects of genetic and shared environmental factors, a number of
nutritional and exercise factors during adolescence influence verbal intelligence during
adulthood. Limitations are noted and suggestions for future research are outlined.

1. Introduction
The health of the brain and the health of the body are inextricably intertwined [1,2]. A growing
number of studies have linked various aspects of cognitive functioning to behaviors that promote and
maintain physical health, including adequate physical exercise [1,3,4] and nutrition [2,5,6]. Research
suggests that aerobic exercise in particular facilitates the development of executive functions and
language abilities in children [4,7] and a host of other cognitive functions in young, middle-aged, and
older adults [3,8]. A sedentary lifestyle, on the contrary, increases the likelihood of verbal, motor, and
intellectual impairment [9,10]. Nutritional factors seem to play an equally important role in neurocognitive
health. A healthy diet, for instance, appears to optimize cognitive performance on verbal, visuospatial,
and memory tasks among various age groups [11­13]. Individuals who are exposed to poor and/or
inadequate nutrition, however, are at risk of exhibiting deficits in neurocognitive functioning [14,15].
Thus, it appears that efforts to sustain healthy eating and exercise behaviors correspond to enhanced
brain health across the lifespan.
Although studies have linked nutritional and fitness factors to numerous cognitive functions,
only a small number of these studies have examined adolescent samples [11,16]. As Hoyland and
colleagues [17] noted in their review of the literature, research examining the influence of eating
and exercise habits during adolescence on subsequent cognitive functioning is particularly sparse.
The literature has instead focused almost entirely on the benefits of physical activity and nutrition for
brain health during childhood [4,6,15] and late adulthood [1,18,19]. Nevertheless, recent research has
suggested healthy eating and exercise habits during the teenage years can improve concentration,
as well as verbal and reasoning ability [20]. Scholars have also generally overlooked the possibility that
genetic factors might confound the link between health behaviors (e.g., nutrition, physical activity) and
various cognitive functions. In an effort to address these limitations in the literature, the current study
utilizes a sample of twins to explore whether: (a) nutritional and exercise factors during adolescence are
predictive of verbal intelligence during early adulthood and (b) such effects remain significant after
accounting for shared genetic and environmental factors.
1.1. The Link between Nutrition and Verbal Intelligence
Both the sufficiency and the quality of nutrition can influence cognitive functioning at various
life stages [5,14,15,21]. A number of studies have indicated that foods rich in antioxidants, long-chain
fatty acids, and other essential vitamins support brain functioning in multiple ways, including,
but not limited to, the synthesis of neurotransmitters [22], the reduction of metal ions [22],
and the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor [2]. One aspect of neurocognitive functioning
that has been repeatedly emphasized in the literature is verbal intelligence [13,14].
Researchers have paid particular attention to early childhood nutrition as a predictor of verbal
intelligence [6,13,23], in large part due to the particular sensitivity of the brain during childhood [24].
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 387
In general, studies examining the influence of childhood nutrition on verbal intelligence reveal
significant associations, both cross-sectionally [14,17,25] and longitudinally [5,12,26]. To illustrate,
a recent study by Liu and colleagues [25] indicated that kindergarten children who ate breakfast regularly
scored higher on tests of verbal intelligence than children who only ate breakfast sporadically. Studies
using more comprehensive measures of diet quality appear to yield analogous results. For instance,
research has found that toddlers with higher scores on a comprehensive eating assessment (i.e., toddlers
with healthier eating patterns) score higher on a picture vocabulary test
(i.e., PPVT) at age 10 [13]. Similar results were garnered by Gale et al. [12], who reported that healthier
dietary habits during the first year of life, including higher fruit and vegetable consumption, were
predictive of verbal intelligence at age 4.
Despite a general emphasis on infant and child nutrition, a number of studies employing adult samples
have also found significant associations between diet quality and verbal fluency/comprehension [21,27].
For instance, Péneau and colleagues [21] studied a sample of 2533 French adults, aged 45­60 at baseline,
and found the regular intake of fruits and vegetables, especially those rich in vitamins C and E,
to be significantly associated with verbal memory 13 years later. Another recent study found that,
even after accounting for SES and child IQ, elderly subjects who consumed a "Mediterranean" diet (i.e.,
greater consumption of vegetables, beans, oil/vinegar dressings, fish, and poultry) were more likely to
evince higher verbal intelligence than subjects with other dietary patterns [27].
Thus, it appears that nutritional factors can have long-lasting effects on various dimensions of
verbal intelligence, including fluency and comprehension.
1.2. The Link between Physical Activity and Verbal Intelligence
In addition to the literature linking nutrition and verbal intelligence, significant associations between
indicators of physical activity and verbal intelligence have also been detected [1,3,4,8,10,19]. In general,
this body of research mirrors the findings of the nutrition literature: participation in regular exercise is
associated with greater verbal aptitude. Again, most of the research examines child or adult samples and
generally neglects adolescents. To illustrate, a study by Scudder and colleagues [4] revealed that children
at a higher physical fitness level exhibited heightened processing of semantic information and sensitivity
to syntactic violations when reading sentences. The results suggest that adequate physical fitness can
have important implications for developing better language skills, including a more comprehensive
vocabulary. A recent meta-analysis of 59 studies from 1947­2009 revealed that physical activity during
childhood has a significant, positive effect on various cognitive functions, including reading and
language ability [28].
Studies exploring the link between physical activity and verbal intelligence during middle and late
adulthood detect a similar pattern [1,3,10,19]. A number of these studies suggest that, even after a
relatively short intervention period, regular aerobic exercise can lead to improvements in verbal
intelligence [3,19]. For example, a recent study found that, following a 12-week intervention involving
regular participation in a "Spinning" exercise group, previously sedentary adults displayed significant
improvements in semantic verbal fluency relative to controls (15% vs. 2% increase) [3].
Long-term exercise patterns also seem to influence verbal ability. A study by Benedict and colleagues [1]
used brain imagining technology and self-report methodology to test the relationship between exercise
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 388
habits and various cognitive skills in older adults. The results indicate that adults who engaged in a
higher number of 30-min exercise sessions per week exhibited a larger brain volume, high white matter
density, and greater verbal fluency. Despite the research highlighting the association between physical
activity and verbal intelligence, studies comparing the effects of exercise on verbal ability across adults
of different ages are lacking. Still, a recent study of a large sample of adults explored the link between
physical activity and fluid cognitive ability across age groups and found that the youngest group (aged
20­24) derived the most cognitive benefits from exercise [8]. When it comes to the link between adult
exercise and cognition, therefore, it seems that earlier involvement in physical activity is preferable.
1.3. The Current Study
Whether examining physical activity or dietary patterns, very few researchers have studied the
influence of adolescent health behaviors on verbal intelligence, but see [11,16,20]. The handful of studies
that have examined this relationship at this stage of the life course, however, suggest that nutrition and
exercise still play a significant role in verbal capacity [11,16]. In addition to the paucity of literature
using adolescent samples, virtually all of the research to date that has examined the interconnections
between diet, physical activity, and verbal intelligence has failed to use a research design that is
genetically informative, but see [29]. Although research by Luciano and colleagues [29] revealed that
diet, exercise and various components of intelligence are influenced by similar genetic factors,
researchers have yet to test the extent to which diet and physical exercise have an environmentally-
mediated effects that are independent of genetic and familial/shared environmental factors. In an effort
to expand upon the findings linking health behaviors to verbal ability, the current study employs a sample
of adolescent twin pairs to test whether differences in their diet and exercise habits predict differences
in their verbal intelligence during early adulthood, controlling for shared environmental and genetic
influences.
2. Method
2.1. Sample
Data for the current study come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health). The Add Health is a large, nationally representative study of American youth [30].
The first wave of data collection began in the 1994­1995 school year and the most recent wave of data
collection occurred in 2008. In total, four waves of data have been collected, covering approximately 14
years of development across adolescence and adulthood. At the first wave of data collection,
over 90,000 youth participated in surveys that included questions about an array of behaviors as well as
family and peer relationships. Additional details about a subsample of youth were garnered through
parent and youth interviews, as well as through direct assessment of their cognitive abilities
(e.g., language, memory). Specifically, 20,745 adolescents and 17,700 of their primary caregivers were
interviewed at wave 1.
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 389
The Add Health sample is particularly useful for the agenda of the current study, as it contains a large
number of siblings. At the first wave of data collection, the interviewed subsample of youth were asked
whether they currently lived with co-twin, full siblings, half sibling, or cousin. If the youth answered in
the affirmative, and their sibling was between the ages of 11 and 20, then their sibling was recruited for
the study. Moreover, a probability sample of additional pairs of full siblings are also included within the
Add Health data [31], resulting in a total subsample of approximately 5500 siblings at wave 1. Research
to date suggests that this subsample resembles the full adolescent sample on a number of behavioral and
demographic indicators [32,33], intimating the utility and generalizability of the sibling subsample. For
reasons to be outlined, the current study utilizes a subsample of monozygotic (MZ) and same-sex dizygotic
(DZ) twins who participated in waves 2 and 3 of the data collection. Although 490 twin pairs (or 980
twins) were initially eligible for inclusion, some twin pairs were of undetermined zygosity and/or were
missing data, resulting in final analytical samples that ranged from N = 644 twins to N = 694 twins.
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Outcome Measure
Verbal Intelligence. At wave 3 of data collection, when the majority of respondents were between the
ages of 18 and 24, Add Health researchers measured the verbal abilities of each subject by employing
an abridged version of the commonly used Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) known as the
Picture Vocabulary Test (PVT). The assessment involved a process in which the interviewer would read
a word aloud while showing four distinct illustrations to the participant. Subjects were asked to select
the illustration that most accurately reflected the meaning of the word for additional information on the
PVT, see [34].
Importantly, the reliability and validity of the PPVT as a measure of verbal intelligence has been
buttressed by prior research [35]. Scores on the PPVT are also highly correlated with scores on other
cognitive batteries [36,37], which bolsters the construct validity of the measure. Included in the
Add Health data are the wave 3 PVT percentile scores, which provide an indication of each subject's
verbal intelligence by calculating the percentage of subjects in the full Add Health sample with lower
scores on the PVT at wave 3. We chose to utilize these percentile scores in the current study,
as they provide a clear indication, in intuitive measurement units, of the verbal intelligence of each
participant at wave 3. Table 1 includes the descriptive statistics of the verbal intelligence measure as
well as all other variables and scales relevant to the analysis.

2.2.2. Nutrition Measures
Fast Food Consumption. We tapped both food quality and food sufficiency by creating three
measures of nutritional inadequacy (i.e., nutritional risk factors) based on several items from the second
wave of data collection, when the vast majority of subjects were still adolescents. The first of these items
concerns fast food consumption. We followed the lead of prior research [38] and created a measure of
fast food consumption using an item from the second wave of data collection. This item inquired about
the frequency of fast food consumption during the previous week. Examples of fast food were given
during the interview, such as McDonald's, Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut, in order to avoid
misclassification. Response options for this item ranged from 0 (zero days during the previous week) to
7 (every day during the previous week).
Low Vegetable Consumption. In addition to our measure of fast food consumption, we created a
second indicator of poor food quality that tapped infrequent vegetable consumption. During wave 2 of
data collection, respondents were asked a number of specific questions regarding their eating habits.
In particular, 12 questions were employed to determine whether respondents ate a number of different
vegetables the day prior to the interview, including broccoli, carrots, kale, spinach, cabbage, squash, and
green beans. We followed the lead of prior research [39] and utilized these questions in the creation of
this item. Response options for each item were binary, including 0 (did not eat yesterday) and 1 (ate
yesterday). The final measure was created so that all respondents who indicated that they did not eat any of
the vegetables asked about in the questions were coded as a 1, whereas respondents who reported eating
any of the vegetables during the previous day were coded as a 0.
Meal Deprivation. In addition to two measures of poor food quality, we created a measure of meal
deprivation. In an effort to determine whether each subject was consuming an adequate amount of food,
we created an item that measured how frequently subjects were failing to eat regular meals during their
adolescent years. At wave 2, participants were asked three questions about the number of days during
the past week in which they ate specific meals: one question about breakfast, one about lunch, and one
about dinner. Each question had response options ranging from 0 (zero days) to 7 (seven days). Scores
on these items were reverse coded so that higher scores indicated a greater tendency to skip that particular
meal (e.g., breakfast). A composite measure was created in order to determine the overall extent of meal
deprivation across all meals. This measure was created by summing together the scores on the
reverse-coded items and then dividing by the total possible number of meals reported (i.e., 21) in order
to yield the proportion of meals that were not eaten during the previous week. Scores closer to 1 on this
item indicate a greater degree of meal deprivation, whereas scores closer to zero indicate more regular
consumption of meals.

2.2.3. Physical Activity Measures
Low Sports Involvement. A number of questions regarding different kinds of physical fitness/activity
were asked of adolescent respondents at the second wave of data collection, including how frequently
the subject participated in an active sport during the week prior to the interview. Subjects were asked,
"During the past week, how many times did you play an active sport, such as baseball, softball,
basketball, soccer, swimming, or football"? Response options included not at all (0), 1 to 2 times (1),
3 to 4 times (2), and 5 or more times (3). The item was reverse-coded so that respondents who
participated in sports less frequently received higher scores.
Low Cycling/Skating. A wave 2, respondents were also asked how many times during the past week
they participated in roller-blading, roller-skating, skateboarding, or bicycling. Response options for this
item also ranged from 0 (not at all) to 3 (5 or more times). The item was reverse-coded in order to reflect
low levels of cycling/skating.
Low General Exercise. Finally, subjects were also asked, "During the past week, how many times did
you exercise, such as jogging, walking, doing karate, jump roping, doing gymnastics or dancing"?
Responses options were coded in the same manner as the previous physical activity measures.
Insufficient Exercise. In an effort to identify those participants who failed to engage in an adequate
amount of exercise during the previous week, regardless of type, we created a general measure of
insufficient exercise using the three exercise measures listed above. Following the lead of Ornelas,
Perreira, and Ayala [40], we created a binary measure of insufficient exercise in which respondents who
participated in less than five bouts of physical activity a week, regardless of type, were assigned a value
of 1, whereas respondents who participated in five or more bouts of physical exercise a week, regardless
of type, were assigned a value of 0. The cut-off point was used in an effort to approximate the
recommended amount of exercise advocated by the American Heart Association as well as the Center
for Disease Control and Prevention, which is that individuals participate in five exercise sessions a week,
lasting at least 30 min (a total of 150 min or more). Although we could not ascertain the actual number
of minutes of exercise each participant engaged in, the number of exercise sessions gives us a close
approximation as to whether or not the subject is engaging in a sufficient or insufficient amount of
physical activity.
2.3. Plan of Analysis
The analysis for the current study will be carried out using a technique known as Defries-Fulker (DF)
analysis. DF analysis is a regression-based method that is capable of providing specific estimates of the
relative effects of genetic factors, shared environmental factors, and nonshared environmental factors.
These estimates are obtained by using samples of sibling pairs who differ in their degree of genetic
similarity (e.g., MZ and same-sex DZ twins). DF analysis decomposes the variance in the outcome
variable into the proportions explained by genetic and environmental factors, while also allowing for the
estimation of regression coefficients for specified nonshared environments (i.e., environments that are
not shared by siblings within a kinship pair). We chose to employ DF analysis in order to ensure that
any associations between nutritional factors, fitness factors and verbal intelligence are not spurious due
to genetic influences. The current genetically informed analysis is an effort to determine whether the
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 392
purported link between diet, physical activity and verbal intelligence is environmentally transmitted or
spurious due to unmeasured genetic influences.
The DF equation has been revised since it was originally postulated by DeFries and Fulker [41,42] in
order to be fit for use among samples drawn from the general population [43]. The revised equation is
depicted as follows:
K1
= b0
+ b1
K2
+ b2
R + b3
(R × K2
) + e (1)
In this equation, K1
represents the PVT percentile score (i.e., the outcome variable) for one of
the twins being analyzed, K2
represents their co-twins PVT percentile score, R is an indicator of
the genetic similarity between the kinship pair (1 for MZ twin pairs and 0.5 for DZ twin pairs),
and R × K2
is an interaction term that multiplies the co-twin's PVT percentile score by their degree of
genetic similarity with their twin. Moreover, b0
represents the constant, b1
represents the proportion of
the variance in verbal ability that is explained by shared environmental influences, b2
is not interpreted
in the DF model, and b3
is the proportion of the variance in verbal intelligence that is explained by genetic
influences. The error term (e) encompasses the effects of the nonshared environment on verbal
intelligence and error.
Recently, Rodgers and Kohler [44] proposed an improvement to Equation (1) that only slightly alters
its form. The new equation is depicted as follows:
K1
= b0
+ b1
(K2
­ Km
) + b2
[R × (K2
- Km
)] + e (2)
In this equation, K1
, K2
, R and e have the same significance as they do in Equation (1).
However, this equation includes the term Km
, which represents the mean value of K2
(or, in this study,
the mean verbal intelligence score for the co-twins). Therefore, the parenthetical statement K2
­ Km
signifies that K2
is mean-centered in this equation. Just as was the case in Equation (1), b0
represents the
constant and b1
represents the proportion of the variance in verbal intelligence that is explained by shared
environmental influences. However, in this updated equation, b2
(instead of b3
) is interpreted as the
proportion of the variance in verbal intelligence that is explained by genetic influences.
The coefficients in the above equation do not tell us the effect of any particular gene or shared
environment on verbal intelligence precisely because the coefficients signify latent factors. Nevertheless,
Equation (2) can be altered slightly to allow for the inclusion of specific nonshared environments of
interest. In the current study, we make use of the following equation in order to examine a number of
nonshared environments related to nutrition and exercise, in an effort to determine whether these factors
have a significant influence on verbal intelligence, net of genetic and shared environmental factors.
The DF equation that allows researchers to include specific nonshared sources of variance is depicted
as follows:
K1
= b0
+ b1
(K2
­ Km
) + b2
[R × (K2
- Km
)] + b3
ENVDIF + e (3)
Equation (3) is almost an exact replication of Equation (2). The only difference is the term ENVDIF.
ENVDIF represents the difference score that is created when one twin's score on a variable is subtracted
from their co-twin's score on the same variable. In the current study, difference scores are calculated for
each of the nutrition and physical activity variables in order to determine if sibling differences in these
variables predict differences in verbal intelligence, net of genetic and shared environmental influences.
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 393
Importantly, b3
in Equation (3) does not represent a latent factor, but instead represents a regression
coefficient, and needs to be interpreted as such (e.g., using critical t-values, p-values, etc.).
A series of DF models were estimated in the present study. The first model employs the baseline DF
equation (Equation (2)) in order to ascertain the proportion of the variance in verbal intelligence that is
due to genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environmental factors. Subsequent models employ
the formula displayed in Equation (3), which allows us to introduce the nutrition and exercise variables
as nonshared sources of variance by including them as difference scores (ENVDIF) in the equation.
The goal of these analyses is to determine whether differences between the twins in diet and physical
activity significantly contribute to differences in their verbal scores, independent of genetic and shared
environmental influences.
In order to maximize the information available on twin pairs in the Add Health, and in line with prior
research [45­47], twins were double entered. Double-entering allows for each twin to be both the
independent and dependent variables in the DF analysis. Despite this advantage, double entering violates
the assumption of the independence of observations (since the same observations are repeated twice).
Violation of this assumption results in deflated standard errors, which biases tests of statistical
significance. We corrected for this in our study by employing Huber-White standard errors, which allows
us to take account of the clustering of observations when estimating the statistical significance of
the results.
3. Results
Table 2 displays the results of the DF models examining the influence of the shared environment,
heritability, and adolescent nutritional factors on verbal intelligence during early adulthood.
Model 1 of Table 2 contains the results of the baseline model, which identifies no specific nonshared
sources of variance and only estimates the proportion of the variance in verbal intelligence
due to heritability and the shared environment. The results of model 1 indicate that shared environmental
factors explain approximately 44% of the variance in verbal intelligence during early adulthood, while
27% of the variance in verbal intelligence during early adulthood is due to genetic factors (in both cases,
p < 0.05). From these results, we can deduce that a combination of the nonshared environment and error
account for the remaining 29% of the variance in verbal intelligence during early adulthood.
Although model 1 allows us to estimate the relative influence of genes, the shared environment,
and the nonshared environment, it does not estimate the effects of any specific genetic or environmental
source of variance. Models 2 through 5, however, extend model 1 by including one or more of the
nutritional factors as nonshared sources of variance. Model 2 includes all three measures of
poor/inadequate nutrition in the DF equation simultaneously, whereas Models 3 through 5 include only
one nonshared source of variance at a time. The results across models 2 through 5, however,
paint a similar picture: twins who do not practice adequate nutrition during adolescence evince
significantly poorer verbal intelligence during adulthood, net of shared environmental and genetic
influences. Specifically, fast food consumption, low vegetable consumption, and meal deprivation
during adolescence all result in statistically significant reductions in verbal intelligence by adulthood,
even after accounting for the effects of genes and the shared environment on verbal intelligence.

The coefficients for the nonshared sources of variance can be interpreted just as OLS regression
coefficients are interpreted, realizing, however, that the unit of analysis is twin pairs (not individuals).
For example, in the current analysis, the coefficients represent the average increase in verbal intelligence
(measured as a percentile score) for every one-unit increase in the nonshared source of variance, relative
to one's twin. In the case of low vegetable consumption, which is a binary variable, the results suggest
that, within twin pairs, the twin with lower vegetable consumption tends to score lower on verbal
intelligence during early adulthood. More specifically, in cases where twins within a pair are discordant
in terms of their vegetable consumption during adolescence, the twin with lower vegetable consumption
will, on average, score 4.34 percentile points lower on verbal intelligence during early adulthood relative
to their co-twin, even after taking genes and the shared environment into account.
Similar results are obtained in the case of meal deprivation, where going from no meal deprivation to
absolute meal deprivation is predicted to result in a 7.46 to 8.10 percentile-point decrease in verbal
intelligence, net of genetic and shared environmental factors. Furthermore, model 2 predicts that adding
an additional day of fast food consumption per week relative to a co-twin will result in an almost full
percentile point drop in relative verbal intelligence. Thus, when taken as a whole, the results of the
models displayed in table two suggest a significant influence of adolescent nutritional factors on adult
verbal intelligence.
Table 3 is presented in the same format as Table 2, except for the inclusion of an additional model
due to a greater number of nonshared sources of variance being examined. Model 1 represents the
baseline model, whereas models 2 through 6 introduce nonshared sources of variance related to physical
fitness during adolescence.

The results from Table 3 indicate that, although no specific category of adolescent physical activity
significantly influenced adult verbal intelligence, youth who failed to engage in a sufficient amount of
exercise evinced lower verbal intelligence scores during early adulthood. To be precise, models 2 and 6
suggest that, even after accounting for genetic and shared sources of variance, twins who failed to engage
in sufficient exercise during adolescence scored between 3.72 and 4.11 percentile points lower on adult
verbal intelligence than co-twins who engaged in regular exercise during adolescence. Nevertheless,
incremental reductions in particular forms of physical activity (e.g., sports, cycling) did not appear to
result in significantly lower verbal intelligence by early adulthood (A sensitivity analysis that included
all nutrition and exercise variables in the same DF model was also conducted. The results revealed that
both high fast food consumption and low vegetable consumption significantly reduce verbal ability
scores during early adulthood. However, in this full model, none of the exercise items predicted verbal
ability scores, suggesting that the effect of exercise on verbal ability does not remain once nutritional
factors are accounted for).
4. Discussion
Behavioral patterns relating to physical activity and diet have been shown to influence various
cognitive functions, including verbal intelligence [1,3­6]. Research exploring the influence of adolescent
nutritional and exercise habits on subsequent verbal intelligence, however, has been very limited, for
exceptions, see [11,16,20]. Moreover, even fewer studies have accounted for the possibility that genetic
factors might explain, at least in part, the link between diet, exercise, and verbal skills, but see [29]. The
main objective of the current study was to address these voids in the literature by testing whether various
nutritional and exercise differences between co-twins during their adolescent years predict differences
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 396
in their verbal intelligence during early adulthood, net of genetic and shared environmental influences.
The results of our study revealed three key findings.
First, our results indicated that both shared environmental factors and genetic factors explain a
significant portion of the variance in verbal intelligence. To be precise, approximately 44% of the
variance in verbal intelligence during early adulthood was attributable to shared environmental factors,
whereas 27% of the variance in verbal intelligence during early adulthood was attributable to genetic
factors. These results also inform us that the remaining portion of the variance (i.e., 29%) can be
attributed to nonshared environmental influences and error. Prior research has often detected a higher
degree of genetic influence on verbal ability as one progress from childhood to early adolescence [48].
In young adult samples, heritability typically remains quite high, which differs from the relatively
modest estimate in the present study [49]. Nevertheless, the findings underscore the utility of genetically-
informed designs in highlighting the relative contribution of genes, the shared environment, and the
nonshared environment. Furthermore, the inclusion of the heritability and shared environment
coefficients in subsequent models exploring the link between nutrition, physical activity, and verbal
intelligence assures us that the significant associations detected are robust to both shared environmental
and genetic influences.
Second, the results revealed that poor nutrition during adolescence corresponds to a significant
decrease in verbal intelligence during early adulthood, even after accounting for genetic and shared
environmental factors. In particular, when twins were discordant in their eating habits, the average verbal
intelligence score for twins with poorer nutrition was significant lower than the verbal intelligence score
of their cotwins. These results held across multiple measures of nutrition, including fast food
consumption, low vegetable consumption, and meal deprivation.
Third, we found that youth who did not engage in a sufficient amount of exercise were more likely
to display lower verbal intelligence during early adulthood. Specifically, relative to their physically
active co-twins, twins who were more sedentary during adolescence showed inferior verbal intelligence
during early adulthood. We found no evidence, however, that small reductions in the frequency of
specific forms of physical activity (e.g., 3 days a week to 2 days a week) resulted in lower verbal
intelligence during early adulthood. In the case of adolescent exercise, therefore, significant reductions
in adult verbal intelligence do not seem to emerge until respondents drop below a particular threshold of
physical activity (i.e., five exercise sessions a week).
5. Conclusions
The current study is, to our knowledge, the first to provide a genetically informed test of the
relationship between adolescent health behaviors (i.e., diet and physical activity) and verbal intelligence
during adulthood. Despite the unique contribution of the study, it is not without its limitations. First, we
would have preferred the operationalization of our key independent variables to be more precise. For
example, our measure of insufficient exercise identifies participants who failed to engage in five or more
bouts of exercise per week. The exact content of each exercise session (e.g., intensity, length), however,
is unknown. Such details would likely prove useful in determining the specific features of physical
activity during adolescence that are most likely to impact subsequent verbal intelligence. Despite this
shortcoming, the simplicity of the measurement of some of our key independent variables results in
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 397
research implications that are straightforward and practical. For example, our findings regarding low
vegetable consumption highlight a nutritional change that would be quite easy to implement, as they
suggest that eating just one serving of vegetables a day during adolescence can lead to greater verbal
intelligence during adulthood.
Second, a large body of research has linked diet and physical activity to a host of other cognitive
functions apart from verbal intelligence, including perceptual organization, processing speed,
memory and visual-spatial skills [1,27]. We would have preferred to have had access to a more
comprehensive battery of cognitive assessments at wave 3 in order to test the robustness of our results.
Nevertheless, such data were not available in the Add Health. Finally, our use of a sample of same-sex
twin pairs may limit the generalizability of the results. We should note, however, that a recent study by
Barnes and Boutwell [50] suggests that twin-based research may be more generalizable to the population
of singletons than previously assumed.
In conclusion, while research has repeatedly demonstrated the impact of nutrition and physical
activity on the verbal capacity of children and older adults, it appears that specific aspects of brain
development and functioning are impacted by diet and exercise choices during the teenage years.
The association between these health behaviors and verbal intelligence also seems to exist independent
of genetic and shared environmental influences, suggesting that relatively simple changes to the diet and
exercise regime during the adolescent years can have a significant influence on verbal intelligence during
early adulthood. Future studies should explore the generalizability of these results to other aspects of
cognitive functioning. Furthermore, replication of Luciano and colleagues' [29] study is also needed to
further elucidate the extent to which health behaviors and intelligence have shared genetic
underpinnings. Finally, scholars should seek to employ more specific measures of nutrition and exercise
(e.g., vitamin content of food, intensity/duration of exercise session) in an effort to build upon the results
of the current study. Additional research that seeks to identify the specific dietary and exercise habits of
youths that have the greatest impact on brain health will hopefully inform the practical behavioral changes
during the adolescent years that can improve life quality during adulthood.
