Trends In Medication Use And Functioning
Before Retirement Age: Are They Linked?
Demographic shifts, not medication use, account for most of the
improvement in physical functioning among people ages 51­61 with
certain chronic conditions.
by Vicki A. Freedman and Hakan Aykan
ABSTRACT: This paper explores the extent to which changes in medication use during the
1990s are linked to improvements in functioning among Americans before they reach re-
tirement age. Using two cross-sections from a survey of Americans ages 51­61, we exam-
ined changes between 1992 and 1998 in the prevalence of functional limitations and med-
ication use associated with five chronic conditions: hypertension, diabetes, lung disease,
stroke, and arthritis. We found no evidence linking increases in medication use to improve-
ments in functioning. Instead, increases in educational attainment offset the negative ef-
fects of increases in obesity and arthritis over this period. Findings underscore the need for
caution in projecting forward improvements in old-age functioning when considering the fu-
ture of Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs that serve the elderly with disabilities.
After nearly a decade of debate
among academics and policymakers, a
consensus is emerging that disability
rates among older Americans have declined
over the past fifteen years.1 If such declines
continue into the future, their effect on the
nation's health and economic well-being
could be far-reaching, with more older Amer-
icans able to work longer and relatively fewer
needing medical and long-term care. How-
ever, the implications of such trends for pub-
licly funded programs such as Medicare,
Medicaid, and Social Security remain far from
clear, in part because it is uncertain whether
such declines will continue. While some have
suggested that continued declines of 1.5 per-
cent per year are plausible, others have cau-
tioned that future trends may not mirror
those of the past decade.2
To understand the consequences of disabil-
ity declines for publicly financed programs, we
need better insight into the causes of the trend.
Current hypotheses may be classified broadly
into long-term and shorter-term factors. Long-
term factors might include better nutrition,
improvements in the public health infrastruc-
ture, and widespread use of infectious disease
treatments such as antibiotics. More recent
explanations include changes in the socioeco-
nomic status of older Americans, healthier life-
styles, increased use of assistive technologies,
less restrictive environments, and better treat-
ment of chronic diseases through medical pro-
cedures and medication use.
Indeed, use of medications has become an
increasingly important aspect of health care
for older Americans, and the development of
drugs aimed at some of the more debilitating

diseases of later life continues rapidly.3 Ap-
proximately nine out of ten older Americans
take one or more prescription drugs daily.4 The
1980s and early 1990s saw major shifts in the
classes of drugs prescribed for some of the
more debilitating chronic conditions--for ex-
ample, increased availability of nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis and
anti-rheumatic drugs for rheumatoid arthri-
tis.5 New classes of psychotropic agents have
become available to treat depression and other
psychiatric conditions, which have been iden-
tified as a major cause of premature disability
among the elderly.6 Drug treatments for diabe-
tes and hypertension also expanded greatly
during this period.7 Frank Lichtenberg has
shown that people with prescriptions for
newer medications have many fewer work dis-
ability days than do those taking older medica-
tions.8 Here we explore whether in 1992 and
1998 changes in medication use associated
with five highly prevalent and often debilitat-
ing chronic conditions are linked to improve-
ments in functioning among Americans of pre-
retirement age.
Data And Approach
The 1992 (n = 9,573) and 1998 (n = 7,099)
waves of the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) provide nationally representative
cross-sections of the noninstitutionalized
population ages 51­61 in those years. In both
years respondents were instructed to report
how much difficulty they had with various
physical tasks (for example, reaching, stoop-
ing, and lifting) because of a health or physical
problem.9 The survey also obtained informa-
tion about height and weight (from which we
calculated obesity) and the history of and cur-
rent medication use for five chronic condi-
tions: hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung
disease, stroke, and arthritis.10
n Reliability of self-reports. Previous
studies generally show excellent agreement
between administrative or medical records
and self-reports for chronic conditions such as
hypertension, diabetes, and stroke.11 Studies of
the reliability and validity of reported medica-
tion use are less common and with one excep-
tion involve foreign populations.12 Moreover, a
study of the influence of question structure on
recall of medication use found that when ques-
tions were linked to specific conditions, as
they are in the HRS, 88 percent of medications
were accurately recalled.13
n Analysis theory and structure. Our
analysis draws upon a well-established depic-
tion of the disablement process.14 Whether pa-
thology and impairments lead to limitations in
functioning is mediated in part by predispos-
ing factors (such as demographic, social, and
behavioral factors) and by intervening factors
(such as medication use, medical care, and
changes in behavior in response to diagnosis).
Intervening factors are inserted during the dis-
ablement process, and the timing of their effects
may be immediate, delayed, or cumulative.15
Our analysis involves four steps. We first
present descriptive statistics on chronic con-
ditions, medication use, and functioning in
1992 and 1998. We then show changes in the
demographic composition of the preretire-
ment-age population and in functioning for
these subgroups. Next we present for the en-
tire preretirement-age population and each
chronic condition group the mean change in
limitations between 1992 and 1998 based on a
series of regression models.16 Our focus is on
whether the change in functioning between
1992 and 1998 is attenuated once changes in
other factors--namely, the demographic com-
position of the population (including age, sex,
race, ethnicity, education, marital status, and
ownership of liquid assets); the chronic dis-
ease profile (as measured by obesity [body
mass index > 30] and indicators of the history
of the five conditions of interest in this study);
and the rate of medication use for the five con-
ditions--are taken into account. Finally, to ex-
plore whether medications have become more
effective over time in relation to functioning,
we test whether improvements have been
greater for groups who used medications than
for those who did not.

stroke, and arthritis increased, but this change
was statistically significant only for arthritis
(Exhibit 1). The prevalence of obesity also in-
creased dramatically, but reports of hyperten-
sion and lung disease declined.17
Statistically significant increases in reports
of medication use occurred among people with
hypertension and diabetes. In 1998 nearly 75
percent of respondents ages 51­61 with hyper-
tension reported taking medications, up from
64 percent in 1992. Similarly, 77 percent in this
age group with diabetes reported medication
use, up from 62 percent in 1992. For the other
three conditions, medication use did not
change appreciably.
During the same period the average number
of functional limitations reported by people
ages 51­61 declined from 1.74 to 1.34 (p < .01)
(Exhibit 2). Fewer limitations were reported
by subgroups of respondents with hyperten-
sion, diabetes, stroke, and arthritis. Only peo-
ple with lung disease did not report signifi-
cantly fewer limitations in 1998 than in 1992.
n Demographic changes. In 1998 Ameri-
cans ages 51­61 were slightly younger and
more likely to be Hispanic, to be unmarried,
and to have completed years of education
beyond high school than they were in 1990s
(Exhibit 3). With the notable exception of
nonwhites, all other groups experienced sig-
nificant improvements in functioning between
1992 and 1998 (Exhibit 4).
n Demographic factors and functional
changes. Before controlling for any other fac-
tors, between 1992 and 1998 the mean number
of limitations declined by ­0.40 (Exhibit 5).
Shifts in the use of medication for the five con-
ditions considered here do not explain the de-
cline, which would have been ­0.44 had no
change in use occurred.
However, demographic factors accounted
for about 40 percent of the decline, attenuat-
ing it to ­0.24. That is, increases in educational
attainment and the shift toward the younger
ages appear to account for much of the im-
provement. Controlling for changes in the
chronic condition profile increases the change
over time to ­0.31. That is, had chronic condi-
tions not increased over this time period, limi-
tations would have declined even more than
they did. Adding information about medica-
tion use after considering these other factors
does not change this finding appreciably. That
is, medication use does not appear to account
for any of the improvements in functioning be-
yond those explained by shifts in the demo-
graphic and chronic-condition profiles of this
population.
Similar results are evident when we focus
on subgroups of people with specific chronic

graphic and socioeconomic composition of the
population, those shifts account for about half
of the decline for arthritis and hypertension
and nearly the entire decline for diabetes and
stroke. Changes in the chronic-condition pro-
file work in the opposite direction, offsetting
some of the decline. For four of the five condi-
tions, medication use does not further explain
any of the declines. Only among those report-
ing a stroke does the coefficient on year atten-
uate when information about medication use
is included (from ­0.34 to ­0.26), but neither
effect is statistically different from finding no
change.
n Medication use and functional limita-
tions. If changes in the type of medication--
and consequently changes in the effectiveness
of treatment--are contributing to improve-
ments in functioning, we would expect to see
greater improvements in functioning among
those reporting medication use compared
with those who are not using medications. We
explore these relationships in Exhibit 6.
Two patterns are noteworthy. First, for all
five conditions, people reporting medication
use had more functional limitations on average
than did those who reported no medication
use. The relationship likely reflects disease se-
verity: That is, those having more severe
chronic conditions were more likely to be put
on medication and also were more likely to
have functional impairments.
Second, the improvements do not appear to
be greater for those reporting medication use.
For those reporting diabetes, only those not
taking medications experienced improve-
ments in functioning over time. For those re-
porting hypertension and arthritis, function-

patterns persisted.

Like previous studies, our analysis provides
support for the finding that functioning im-

ports of medication use also increased dramat-
ically for hypertension and diabetes. For lung
disease, stroke, and arthritis, reports of medi-
cation use remained stable. Although there is
clearly more medication use among this age
group, we were unable to find statistical evi-
dence linking medication use to improve-
ments in functioning for the conditions con-
sidered here.
n Limitations. This study is limited in
several important respects. First, our analysis
is limited to reports of medication use associ-
ated with only five chronic conditions. It may
be that medication use for other disease proc-
esses has played an integral role in improving
functioning. For example, pharmacological
treatment of depression has increased mark-
edly during the 1990s.18 Medications aimed at
relieving gastrointestinal discomfort, the
symptoms of menopause (primarily in the
form of estrogen therapy), and back pain also
clearly have implications for quality of life but
were beyond the scope of this study.
Second, we have not considered medical
treatments beyond pharmacological agents.
For example, surgical treatments for vision
loss because of cataracts and glaucoma and for
hip and knee replacements have also increased
dramatically over the past decade. If the rela-
tive importance of medical treatment to recent
trends in old-age functioning is to be fully un-
derstood, further study of the contribution of
these important procedures is warranted.
Third, data limitations kept us from ad-
dressing what types of medications people
were using in each year. However, we did not
find evidence consistent with aggregate im-
provements in the effectiveness of medication
for the five conditions considered here.
Fourth, our analysis focuses on people ages
51­61. But the largest improvements in func-
tioning have been observed for much older
people.19 It may be that the beneficial effects of
medication use in midlife are not fully appar-
ent until later in life. Follow-up analyses with
future waves of the HRS could provide valu-
able insight into the cumulative benefits of
medication use in midlife.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, be-
cause of changes in question wording in the
data we drew upon, we excluded from our
measure of functioning several mobility items
that are typically included in functional limi-
tation scales (for example, walking one or sev-
eral blocks, or climbing one or several flights of
stairs). It may be that medication use has a
greater effect on mobility than on other body
functions included here. As newer data be-
come available to examine the link between
medication use and mobility-related impair-
ments, this question should be addressed.
n Education factor. Notwithstanding
these limitations, our analysis suggests that
changes in the rate of medication use and its
effectiveness do not appear to be driving re-
cent improvements in functioning at ages 51­
61. Instead we find, consistent with previous
studies, that increases in educational attain-
ment appear to be an important factor.20 Had
years of schooling not increased, functioning
would have improved only half as much as it
did from 1992 to 1998. Educational levels
among older Americans will continue to in-
crease over the next several decades, but not at
the rates observed during the 1980s and early
1990s.21 Taken together, these findings under-
score the need for caution in projecting for-
ward improvements in old-age functioning
when considering the future of Medicare,
Medicaid, and other programs that serve the
older population with disabilities.
n Obesity. Also noteworthy are the large
increases in some of the most disabling condi-
tions in this preretirement-age group. Notably,
obesity increased more than 25 percent in just
six years. Other studies have confirmed an
obesity epidemic occurring in the United
States that reaches down the age spectrum, af-
fecting one in four of America's children.22
Obesity has been linked not only to disability
but also to costly conditions such as heart dis-
ease, stroke, and diabetes. Studies of the impli-
cations of impending increases in obesity for
future disability rates and related medical
costs are clearly a critical next step.
n Narrowed racial gap. Although most
demographic groups reported improvements
in functioning between 1992 and 1998, non-

whites--a group well documented to be dis-
advantaged in terms of late-life health--did
not experience such gains. In further analyses
(not shown), we explored whether this lack of
improvement could be attributed to dispro-
portionately low medication use but found the
opposite: For the five conditions considered
here, nonwhites had higher rates of medication
use relative to whites, even after we controlled
for other health and socioeconomic differences
across these groups. These findings may signal
yet another cautionary note: The recent nar-
rowing of the racial gap in old-age disability
may yet again reverse course as the remaining
members of the birth cohorts considered here
(1931­1947) enter old age.23
n Future research agenda. Finally, our
analysis suggests that researchers may need to
refocus their search for the causes of recent im-
provements in late-life functioning. While our
findings do not rule out substantial future
contributions of pharmaceuticals to the qual-
ity of life of older persons, researchers may do
well to focus on other factors, particularly
those linked to educational attainment.

9. Minor wording differences existed between the
1992 and 1998 surveys with respect to functional
limitation items. However, our analysis of the
1994 wave of the HRS, which asked both sets of
questions for a randomly selected group of re-

spondents (N = 595), suggested a lack of sensi-
tivity to such wording changes for the seven
items included here: sitting for about two hours;
getting up from a chair after sitting for long peri-
ods; lifting or carrying weights over ten pounds;
stooping, kneeling, or crouching; picking up a
dime from a table; reaching or extending arms
above shoulder level; and pulling or pushing
large objects. These seven items scale into a sin-
gle factor with high internal consistency
(Cronbach's alpha = .80) and good predictive va-
lidity. We also explicitly accounted for the influ-
ence of wording changes in an alternative set of
estimates and tests. Because substantive conclu-
sions were not affected by these corrections, we
present the more straightforward uncorrected
estimates here. More details are available from

10. The HRS also asked about heart disease in both
years, but the wording of these questions dif-
fered between 1992 and 1998, so the condition,
albeit important, is not considered here. For ar-
thritis, survey respondents were asked if they
ever had or if a doctor ever told them that they
had arthritis. For all other conditions, they were
asked to report whether a doctor ever told them
that they had the given condition. Medication-
use questions were tailored to each condition as
follows. Hypertension: Are you currently taking
any medication for the condition? Diabetes: Do
you now use medication that you swallow or in-
sulin injections to treat or control your diabetes?
Stroke: Are you taking any medications because
of the stroke and its complications? Lung disease
and arthritis: Are you currently taking any medi-
cation or other treatments for the condition?

15. Here we ignore these circularities; however, we
also examined panel-based evidence about
changes between 1994 and 2000, using informa-
tion about medication use and other predictors
from 1992 and 1998, respectively. Changes in
functioning between 1994 and 2000 were much
smaller, and the role of medication use was not
appreciably different than the results presented
here.
16. Here we present results from ordinary least
squares regression; however, our findings are ro-
bust to a variety of alternative models including
Poisson, negative binomial, and lognormal speci-
fications.
