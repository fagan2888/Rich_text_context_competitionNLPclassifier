Abstract
Background: Direct hemoperfusion using polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column (PMX-DHP)
therapy has been approved for sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome, but its
efficacy for other rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonias (RPIPs) is unclear. The purpose
of this study was to examine the efficacy of PMX-DHP therapy for acute respiratory failure in
patients with RPIPs, when compared with a historical control receiving conventional treatment
without PMX-DHP.
Methods: This study comprised 77 patients with RPIPs in our institute between January 2002
and December 2015. The initial 36 patients between January 2002 and March 2007 were
treated without PMX-DHP (historical control group), and the following 41 patients between
April 2007 and December 2015 were treated with PMX-DHP (PMX-DHP group) once daily for
two successive days concurrently with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. The
90-day mortality and clinical factors were compared between the groups. Cox proportional
hazards models were constructed to analyze 90-day mortality and identify predictors.
Results: The 90-day mortality rate was significantly lower in the PMX-DHP group than in
the controls (41.5% versus 66.7%, p = 0.019). PMX-DHP therapy was significantly associated
with mortality (hazard ratio 0.505; 95% confidence interval, 0.270­0.904; p = 0.032). There
were significant differences in the serial changes in the PaO2
/FiO2
ratio, SOFA score, and
blood neutrophil counts from days 0­5 after PMX-DHP between the survivor and non-survivor
groups (p = 0.015, p < 0.001, p = 0.035, respectively). The improved PaO2
/FiO2
ratio on day 3
significantly correlated with the change in blood neutrophil counts (rs
= -0.431, p = 0.006).
Conclusions: PMX-DHP therapy may be effective in RPIPs patients accompanied by acute
respiratory failure and is expected to reduce mortality rates.

conditions characterized by progressive dyspnea
and severe acute hypoxemia.1­6 Aggressive sup-
portive therapies for RPIPs, including high-dose
corticosteroids (CS) alone or in combination
with immunosuppressive agents such as cyclo-
phosphamide and cyclosporine, have been per-
formed. However, these patients are occasionally
refractory to conventional therapies, and the
mortality remains high at 50­80%.1­3,6
Direct hemoperfusion using polymyxin
B-immobilized fiber column (PMX-DHP) ther-
apy as an extracorporeal blood filter has been
developed to remove blood endotoxin and is used
for the treatment of patients with endotoxemia
and septic shock.7­9 PMX-DHP therapy has been
reported to improve not only hemodynamic sta-
tus, but also respiratory dysfunction in patients
with septic acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS).10­12 These studies also demonstrated
that PMX-DHP may adsorb and eliminate
increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and
mediators and activated leukocytes, which are
thought to have an essential role in the pathogen-
esis of ARDS.
There have been several reports of case series in
which a combination of hemoperfusion of PMX
and conventional therapies was used for the
treatment of RPIPs, including IPF, connective
tissue disease-associated interstitial pneumonia
(CTD-IP), and drug-induced pneumonia.13­15
Recently, a multicenter retrospective study,
including acute exacerbation of IPF patients,
revealed that the PMX-DHP treatment of RPIPs
with acute respiratory failure might have a ben-
eficial effect on oxygenation and survival.16 We
also reported that a combination of PMX-DHP
and conventional therapies was effective against
fatal drug-induced interstitial pneumonia and
RPIP due to clinically amyopathic dermatomy-
ositis (DM).15,17 However, the effects of PMX-
DHP treatment on acute respiratory failure
during RPIPs have not been fully established.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy
of PMX-DHP as an add-on therapy for acute
respiratory failure in patients with RPIPs by ret-
rospectively comparing the outcomes of patients
with RPIPs who were treated either with con-
ventional therapies plus PMX-DHP (PMX-
DHP group) or with conventional therapies
alone (historical control group).
Methods
Study population
We performed a historical control study in a sin-
gle institute, Kumamoto University Hospital.
The study population comprised 77 patients with
RPIPs, including idiopathic interstitial pneumo-
nias (IIPs) and CTD-IP, who were treated with a
combination of conventional therapies and PMX-
DHP or conventional therapies alone from 2002
to 2015. Patients with IIPs, including IPF, non-
specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and AIP
were diagnosed according to the international
consensus classification of the American Thoracic
Society/European Respiratory Society.18,19
CTD-IP, including rheumatoid arthritis, DM,
polymyositis (PM), systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), Sjögren syndrome
(SjS), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD),
and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) were diag-
nosed based on each established criteria.20 RPIPs
including acute exacerbation of IPF were defined
using the criteria proposed by Collard and col-
leagues,2 with slight modifications for adaptation
to interstitial pneumonias other than IPF. Briefly,
the criteria for diagnosis of RPIPs were as fol-
lows: (1) previous or concurrent diagnosis of
interstitial pneumonias; (2) unexplained worsen-
ing of dyspnea within 1 month; (3) evidence of
hypoxemia as defined by the partial pressure of
arterial O2
(PaO2
)/fraction of inspired O2
(FiO2
)
(P/F) ratio <300 mmHg; (4) high-resolution
computed tomography (HRCT) findings with
newly developed ground-glass opacities and/or
consolidations; (5) no evidence of pulmonary
infection on bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum
culture and negative results on blood tests for
other potentially infectious pathogens; and (6)
exclusion of left heart failure, pulmonary embo-
lism, pneumothorax, and other possible causes of
acute respiratory failure.14 For inclusion in this
study, written informed consent was obtained
from each patient. When an unconscious patient
under sedation for mechanical ventilation was not
able to give consent, the consent was obtained
from a family member. Blood endotoxin levels
were determined by the Endospecy test.
From April 2007 to December 2015, 41 patients
who met the inclusion criteria were eligible for
treatment with a combination of PMX-DHP and
conventional therapies (PMX-DHP group).

From January 2002 to March 2007, 36 patients
who met the inclusion criteria and who were
treated with conventional therapies alone were
nominated as the historical comparison controls
(historical control group). All patient records
were reviewed to obtain demographic data and
details of initial presentation at the start of PMX-
DHP and/or conventional therapies. In the his-
torical control, three of seven IPF and one of
eight idiopathic NSIP were pathologically con-
firmed by surgical lung biopsy. In the PMX-DHP
group, two of five IPF and two of nine idiopathic
NSIP were pathologically confirmed. This study
followed the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki; the study protocol was approved by the
Human Ethics Review Committee of Kumamoto
University Hospital (No. 2034), and written
informed consent in the PMX-DHP group was
obtained from all patients or their family mem-
bers for the use of PMX-DHP.
PMX-DHP and conventional therapies
We performed PMX-DHP therapy (Toraymyxin;
Toray Medical Co., Tokyo, Japan) in RPIPs
patients with acute respiratory failure who were
resistant to conventional therapies, including
high-dose CS and/or immunosuppressive agents.
There were no pre-specified criteria for defining
resistance to conventional therapy; however, in
most cases resistance to the therapy was judged
by two or more of the following: (1) worsening of
dyspnea; (2) increase of parenchymal abnormali-
ties on chest radiograph or HRCT; and (3) dete-
rioration of P/F ratio. Inclusion criteria of
PMX-DHP therapy for RPIPs patients were as
follows: (1) current diagnosis of RPIPs; (2)
resistance to conventional therapy judged by an
attending physician. Exclusion criteria of PMX-
DHP were as follows: (1) >85 years old; (2)
needed continuous hemodiafiltration; (3) history
of cerebrovascular disorder within 1 year; (4)
pregnancy or breastfeeding; (5) liver cirrhosis or
other serious liver disorders; (6) severe hemor-
rhagic diseases; (7) advanced cancer; and (8)
considered ineligible for PMX-DHP by an
attending physician. Direct hemoperfusion with
PMX was performed using conventional equip-
ment for hemoperfusion and a circuit for hemo-
dialysis. For venous access, a double-lumen
catheter was inserted into the femoral vein using
Seldinger's method. Direct hemoperfusion was
performed at a flow rate of 80­100 ml/min for 4
h twice, with a time interval of approximately 24
h. Nafamostat mesylate (Torii Pharma Co. Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan) was used as an anticoagulant.
For the conventional therapies, CS alone or in
combination with immunosuppressive agents,
including cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, or
tacrolimus, were administered to all patients with
RPIPs in this study. All patients received 1­3
courses of high-dose CS pulse therapy (methyl-
prednisolone 1000 mg/day for 3 consecutive
days) followed by tapering doses of prednisolone
with or without cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2
every 3­4 weeks) or cyclosporine (2­3 mg/kg/
day, followed by adjustment to trough levels of
100­150 ng/ml) or both. Tacrolimus (1­3 mg/
day, followed by adjustment to trough levels of
5­10 ng/ml), instead of cyclosporine, was also
added to the regimen in some patients.
Respiratory supports such as oxygen inhalation
therapy, noninvasive positive pressure ventila-
tion, and invasive positive pressure ventilation
were provided to the patients with respiratory
failure at the attending physician's discretion in
each case.
Data collection
We defined the day when PMX-DHP and/or
conventional therapies were initiated as day 0.
The patients were followed for 90 days after the
therapies. All of the patients' backgrounds,
including age, sex, smoking status, clinical diag-
nosis, contents of previous treatments, peripheral
blood counts, blood biochemistry, P/F ratio,
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
(APACHE) II score,21 and Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score,22 at the initial
treatments were compared between the two
groups. Blood samples were collected at diagno-
sis, just before PMX-DHP therapy, and at 3 and
5 days after the initial PMX-DHP. Survival time
was defined as days from initial treatment for
RPIPs to death. We also evaluated 90-day mor-
tality rates. The mortality rates were calculated
based on all causes of death, and the cumulative
mortality rate was estimated using the Kaplan­
Meier method; intergroup differences were tested
using the log-rank test. In the PMX-DHP group,
the enrolled patients were divided into the groups
of survivors and non-survivors on day 90 to inves-
tigate the effects of PMX-DHP therapy by identi-
fying clinical and laboratory differences by
recording the clinical and physiological data just

before and at 3 and 5 days after the PMX-DHP
therapy.
Statistical analysis
Clinical and laboratory data were collected from
the patients' medical records. Continuous varia-
bles were expressed as the mean ± standard devia-
tion unless otherwise stated and were compared
using the Mann­Whitney U-test. Categorized
variables were analyzed using the chi-square test
or Fisher's exact test as appropriate for the sample
size. Spearman's rank correlation (rs
) test was
used to assess the relationship between improved
P/F ratio after PMX-DHP therapy and changes of
neutrophil counts in blood. The Cox proportional
hazards regression model was used for univariate
and multivariate analyses to determine the signifi-
cant predictors of survival. A p-value <0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance.
Comparisons of the P/F ratio, SOFA score, serum
levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehy-
drogenase (LDH), Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-
6), and neutrophil counts in blood between the
groups of survivors and non-survivors over time
after PMX-DHP were analyzed by repeated meas-
ures analysis of variance (ANOVA) adjusted for
the baseline values as a covariate and by post-hoc
Bonferroni test. The last observation carried for-
ward method for missing data was used for the
analysis. Missing samples occurred because of
death or samples not drawn. On the basis of the
mortality in our retrospective study of acute exac-
erbation of IPF,23 if a 50% reduction in the hazard
ratio (HR) could be achieved in the PMX-DHP
group, then, assuming an  of 0.05 and 80%
power, a sample size of at least 72 subjects was
needed. All statistical analyses were performed
using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics
During the study period, 77 patients fulfilled the
inclusion criteria described above. Forty-one
patients were eligible for the treatments with
PMX-DHP (PMX-DHP group), and 36 patients
were eligible for the treatments without PMX-
DHP (historical control group). The baseline
characteristics of the study population are shown
in Table 1. There were no significant differences
in age, sex, smoking status, clinical diagnosis, and
previous therapy between the two groups. In the
PMX-DHP group, four patients with DM were
positive for anti-ARS antibody and the remaining
eight patients were positive for anti-MDA-5 anti-
body. In the historical control, all five patients
with DM were negative for anti-Jo-1 antibody. In
the PMX-DHP group, 17 patients received CS
therapy before the onset of RPIPs; eight of these
patients underwent immunosuppressive therapy
with cyclosporine (n = 7) or tacrolimus (n = 1),
and one patient received pirfenidone as an antifi-
brotic agent. In the control group, 16 patients
received CS before onset; seven patients under-
went immunosuppressive therapy with cyclo-
sporine (n = 6) or cyclophosphamide (n = 1).
The mean white blood cell counts, neutrophils,
CRP, LDH, KL-6, and surfactant protein-D
were elevated in both groups, but were not signifi-
cantly different. There was no significant differ-
ence in the respiratory failure indices between the
groups on admission (mean P/F ratio; PMX-
DHP group, 160.1 ± 60.9 mmHg versus control
group, 172.1 ± 74.3 mmHg; p = 0.540). The
APACHE II and SOFA scores were not signifi-
cantly different between the two groups.
Endotoxin levels before initial treatment and
PMX-DHP therapy were within the normal range
in all patients.
Treatment for RPIPs
Therapeutic interventions performed during the
study are shown in Table 2. After the diagnosis of
RPIPs, all patients were treated with high-dose CS
pulse therapy alone or combination therapy with
high-dose CS pulse therapy and immunosuppres-
sive agents such as cyclophosphamide, cyclo-
sporine, or tacrolimus, followed by maintenance
treatment with a tapered dose of CS. The combina-
tion therapy was applied to 33 of the 41 patients
(80%) in the PMX-DHP group and 25 of the 36
patients (69%) in the control group. The number
of patients receiving combination therapy with CS,
cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine or tacrolimus
in the PMX-DHP group tended to be larger than
that in the historical control group; however, there
was no significant difference between the two
groups (p = 0.056). Sivelestat sodium hydrate was
administered to 26 patients (63%) in the PMX-
DHP group and 20 patients (56%) in the control
group. Mechanical ventilation was applied to 23
patients (56%) in the PMX-DHP group and 16
patients (45%) in the control group. There were no
significant differences in the treatments, excluding

PMX-DHP therapy, between the control and
PMX-DHP groups. The mean interval between
the diagnosis of RPIPs and PMX-DHP therapy
was 6.3 ± 11.0 (range 0­48) days. Eight patients
were treated without PMX-DHP and excluded
after April 2007. Five of eight patients showed
good response to the conventional therapy and the
remaining three patients died before commence-
ment of PMX-DHP therapy.
Effect of treatment on mortality
The Kaplan­Meier estimate of survival function
during the 90-day study period is given for both
the PMX-DHP and historical control groups in
Figure 1. The 90-day mortality rate was 41.5%
(17/41) in the PMX-DHP group and 66.7%
(24/36) in the control group. There was a signifi-
cant difference in mortality (p = 0.019 by log-
rank test) between the two groups. According to
underlying diseases, the 90-day mortality rate in
the PMX-DHP and the control group was 60.0%
and 57.1% in IPF, 33.3% and 87.5% in idio-
pathic NSIP, 16.7% and 25.0% in AIP, and
47.6% and 70.6% in CTD-IP, respectively.
Based on a classification of the treatment regi-
men, the 90-day mortality in the combination
with CS and immunosuppressive agents was sig-
nificantly different for the two groups (45.0% in
the PMX-DHP group versus 76.0% in the histori-
cal control, log-rank test, p = 0.011, Figure 2).
Causes of death included respiratory failure due

to RPIPs (n = 16) and pulmonary infection (n =
1) in the PMX-DHP group, and respiratory fail-
ure due to RPIPs (n = 21), pulmonary infection
(n = 2), and unknown cause (n = 1) in the his-
torical control group. We used a Cox propor-
tional hazards model to perform uni- and
multivariate analysis to determine the independ-
ent factors for mortality. In the univariate analy-
sis, the serum level of CRP and PMX-DHP
therapy were significant predictors of mortality
(Table 3). Similarly, in the multivariate analysis,
the serum level of CRP (HR 0.948; 95% CI,
0.900­0.998; p = 0.042) and PMX-DHP therapy
(HR 0.505; 95% CI, 0.270­0.904; p = 0.032)
remained independent factors for reduced risk of
mortality (after adjusting for age, sex, SOFA
score, LDH, and KL-6). Age, sex, diagnosis of
IPF, P/F ratio, SOFA score, and serological tests
except for CRP levels were not prognostic factors
in this study. In subgroup analyses by disease
type, PMX-DHP therapy in idiopathic NSIP
(HR 0.102; 95% CI, 0.015­0.703; p = 0.021)
and CRP levels in CTD-IP (HR 0.879; 95% CI,
0.797­0.970; p = 0.01) were independently asso-
ciated with mortality (data not shown).
Comparison of the clinical parameters between
the survivor and non-survivor groups among
the patients with PMX-DHP
In the PMX-DHP group, the patients were
divided into the survivor (24 patients) and non-
survivor (17 patients) groups on day 90 after the
treatments. A comparison of the demographic
and laboratory data of these two groups is shown
in Table 4. The mean intervals between the diag-
nosis of RPIPs and PMX-DHP therapy were 7.0
± 11.2 days in the survivor group and 5.4 ± 10.9
days in the non-survivor group, but the difference
was not significant. The clinical parameters at
admission and at the beginning of PMX-DHP
therapy were not different between the survivor
and non-survivor groups, although the SOFA
scores in the survivor group tended to be lower
than those in the non-survivor group on admis-
sion (3.1 ± 0.8 versus 4.2 ± 1.9, p = 0.051).
Figure 3 shows the serial changes in clinical
parameters in the survivor and non-survivor
groups until 5 days after PMX-DHP therapy.
There were significant differences in the serial
changes in the P/F ratio, SOFA score, and blood
neutrophil counts from initial treatment to day 5
between the two groups (p = 0.015, p < 0.001, p
= 0.035, respectively). In the post-hoc test, the
P/F ratio in the survivor group was significantly
increased on day 5 relative to that in the non-sur-
vivor group (p < 0.01). The SOFA score signifi-
cantly decreased from days 3 to 5 (p < 0.01).
Neutrophil counts were increased at the begin-
ning of PMX-DHP therapy in both groups, but
the difference was not significant, and the counts
were significantly decreased at day 3 after the
PMX-DHP therapy in the survivor group relative
to those at the beginning. Interestingly, the
improved P/F ratio on day 3 after PMX-DHP sig-
nificantly correlated with the change in neutro-
phil counts in blood (rs

not significantly different between the survivor
and non-survivor groups.

Discussion
The results of this study show that PMX-DHP
therapy may have a beneficial effect on acute res-
piratory failure of RPIPs in patients with IIPs and
CTD. The 90-day mortality rate was significantly
lower in the patients treated with PMX-DHP
than in the historical control patients treated
without PMX-DHP, and PMX-DHP therapy
predicted survival in the univariate and multivari-
ate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards
regression model. Our findings suggest that
PMX-DHP therapy improves the outcomes in
RPIPs.
PMX-DHP therapy has been used for the treat-
ment of endotoxin-induced ARDS in Japan.7,10,11
The early use of polymyxin hemoperfusion in an
abdominal septic shock (EUPHAS) trial, a pro-
spective multicenter randomized study, demon-
stratedsignificantimprovementsinhemodynamics
and organ dysfunction and reduced 28-day mor-
tality rate.8 The main mechanism of action of
PMX-DHP is the direct adsorption of circulating
endotoxin.
There are several published clinical studies of
small and heterogeneous cohorts, as well as case
reports of RPIPs patients mainly from Japan,
demonstrating the attractive efficacy of PMX-
DHP. The first clinical report on PMX-DHP for
RPIPs patients was published in 2006 by Seo and
colleagues, who reported that six cases of acute
exacerbation of IPF were safely and successfully
treated with PMX-DHP.13 Their study showed
that PMX-DHP in IPF with acute respiratory
failure may be helpful for life-threatening condi-
tions refractory to conventional treatments such
as high-dose CS pulse. Since the publication of
this interesting case report, this therapy has been
tried in a variety of RPIPs, including acute exac-
erbation of IPF, as summarized in Table 5.14,16,24­29
A multicenter retrospective analysis was done by
Abe and colleagues in 2012,16 in which 160 sub-
jects with RPIPs, including 73 with acute exacer-
bation of IPF, were treated with PMX-DHP. The
therapy showed a favorable outcome although
control subjects without PMX-DHP therapy had
not been set up. Recently, three retrospective
studies were conducted with comparative analy-
ses between PMX-DHP and control groups.27­30
In two of these three studies, PMX-DHP therapy
showed a significantly favorable prognosis, which
was similar to our results. Enomoto and col-
leagues showed a significant improvement in the
12-month survival rate with PMX-DHP therapy
for acute exacerbation of IPF,28 although intersti-
tial lung diseases other than IPF were not exam-
ined. However, there are limitations in the
interpretation of these results because all of the
above studies, including ours, were not rand-
omized. Further studies including randomized
controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the effi-
cacy of PMX-DHP in patients with RPIPs.
In the present study, we selected patients with
IIPs including IPF and CTD-IP with acute res-
piratory failure and compared the clinical features
and outcomes between the patients treated with
PMX-DHP and those with conventional therapy
without PMX-DHP as a historical control. We
showed a significant improvement of mortality in
the PMX-DHP group relative to that in the con-
trol group. The severity of respiratory failure on
initial treatment was not significantly different
between the two groups. Approximately half of
the patients required mechanical ventilation to
ensure sufficient oxygenation in both groups. The
factors affecting mortality in patients with acute
exacerbation of interstitial pneumonias and acute
lung injury have been described, including age,
blood biomarkers, scoring systems of organ fail-
ure, chest HRCT findings, and presence of sys-
temic inflammatory response syndrome.3,19,30­32
In our study, these demographic findings, blood
tests, APACHE II score, and SOFA score showed
no significant differences between the PMX-DHP

and control groups at baseline, although the ana-
lyzed subjects had various types of underlying dis-
eases. Therefore, it was considered reasonable to
compare the two groups.
In the present study, the number of neutrophils in
blood decreased 3 days after PMX-DHP therapy,
and there was a significant difference in the time-
dependent changes of peripheral blood neutro-
phils between the survivor and non-survivor
groups (Figure 3). Furthermore, a reduction of
neutrophil counts after PMX-DHP may lead to
improved pulmonary oxygenation (Figure 4).
The major pathological finding of RPIPs is dif-
fuse alveolar damage (DAD).4,5 DAD with
chronic fibrotic lung is found in patients with not
only IPF but also idiopathic fibrotic NSIP and
interstitial pneumonia related to CTD.5,6 Acute
lung injury occurring in patients with AIP and
CTD at initial presentation also shows a histo-
logical feature of DAD without pre-existing inter-
stitial pneumonia.30 Although the mechanism of

lung injury in DAD remains unclear, inflamma-
tory cells, including neutrophils and some inflam-
matory mediators, are thought to have a central
role in developing lung damage.4,30 Abe and col-
leagues demonstrated that neutrophil adsorption
by PMX may be of therapeutic value for acute
exacerbation of interstitial pneumonias.33
The mechanism of the action of PMX-DHP ther-
apy for RPIPs has not been elucidated. The
removal of circulating endotoxin dose has not
been shown to be very effective because the blood
level of endotoxin was within the normal range in
patients with RPIPs of our study and in previous
reports.13­17 We observed that blood neutrophil
counts were reduced after PMX-DHP and there
was a negative relationship between the reduced
neutrophil counts and the increased P/F ratio
after PMX-DHP, suggesting that the adsorptive
removal of neutrophils by PMX-DHP may be a
potential mechanism of action, as previously
reported.33 Further studies are required to deter-
mine the precise mechanism of PMX-DHP ther-
apy for RPIPs.
In our study, the elevated levels of CRP at diag-
nosis were associated with a decreased hazard of
90-day mortality (Table 3). This finding seems to
conflict with previous study findings regarding
the role of CRP as an inflammatory marker of
predicted risk.3,34 Song and colleagues demon-
strated that higher levels of CRP were a signifi-
cant risk factor of acute exacerbation of IPF and
other acute illnesses such as sepsis and pneumo-
nia and were associated with adverse outcome.3
Conversely, a study among patients with ARDS
showed an association between higher CRP levels
and decreased mortality.35 Thus, the clinical sig-
nificance of CRP in interstitial lung diseases with
acute respiratory failure has been controversial.
The significance of CRP as a mortality predictor
should be confirmed in future studies.
Acute exacerbation of IPF has been known to be
a major risk factor for mortality in patients with
interstitial pneumonias. However, in our study,
IPF was not associated with increased risk of
mortality on univariate analysis. This may con-
tribute to the fact that the majority of patients
were diagnosed based on radiographic patterns
because of limited availability of histological find-
ings. The non-IPF patients, especially with idio-
pathic NSIP, may include some cases of
misclassified IPF. On the other hand, our results
are similar to those of the previous study, which
reported that survival rates after acute exacerba-
tion treated by PMX-DHP were comparable
between IPF and all interstitial pneumonias,
including IPF, in a multicenter retrospective
analysis,16 although univariate analysis was not
conducted. Taken together, PMX-DHP therapy
may have therapeutic benefits not only for acute
exacerbation in IPF, but also for RPIPs other
than IPF.
The clinical importance of the timing and dura-
tion of PMX-DHP therapy has been investigated.
In patients with ARDS and RPIPs, including
acute exacerbation of IPF, early induction of
PMX-DHP therapy gave better effects and was a
very important factor affecting survival.25,27
Furthermore, a longer duration of PMX-DHP
(12 h) was more effective for acute exacerbation of
IP than a shorter duration (6 h).24 Although the
starting time and duration of PMX-DHP in our
study was somewhat delayed and shorter in com-
parison with previous studies, there was no differ-
ence between the survivor and non-survivor
groups (Table 4). Other clinical parameters,
including the P/F ratio on admission and just
before PMX-DHP therapy, also did not differ
between the groups. The SOFA score is a reliable
and useful means of classifying the severity of dis-
eases and estimating the outcome in ICU
patients.22 Some authors have previously reported
that the serial evaluations of the SOFA score also
predicted the outcome in critically ill patients.8,36
Recently, Kao and colleagues reported that the
sequential assessment of organ dysfunction within
the first 3 days of mechanical ventilation predicted
the outcome of patients with severe acute respira-
tory failure.37 A recent randomized controlled
study showed that PMX-DHP therapy improved
the SOFA scores and mortality rate of sepsis
patients.8 In our study, as shown in Figure 3, the
SOFA score on days 3 and 5 and the P/F ratio on
day 5 after PMX-DHP therapy in the survivors
were significantly different from those in the non-
survivors. From our results, the changes in the
SOFA score after PMX-DHP rather than the ini-
tial score may be useful for predicting the clinical
outcome in patients with RPIPs, although Hara
and colleagues showed that the SOFA score in
RPIPs was not affected by PMX-DHP.14
This study had several limitations. First, this was a
retrospective historical control and not a rand-
omized controlled study. Temporal trends in the
H Ichiyasu, Y Horio et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tar 273
diagnosis and treatment may have affected the
results from the use of a historical control group,
and there could have been a non-contemporane-
ous control bias. Because this study included
patients from two different time frames within a
13-year period, advances in supportive care such
as mechanical ventilation and infection control
during the periods may also have influenced the
results. Second, this study was conducted in a sin-
gle institution; therefore, the number of patients
was limited. The heterogeneity of underlying dis-
eases also made it difficult to examine prognostic
variables. Some negative or positive associations
in the statistical analyses may have been due to
inadequate power derived from the small sample
size. Third, not all the patients in this study were
treated according to the same protocol. Takada
and colleagues reported that AIP associated with
DM/PM patients who were started on immuno-
suppressive agents simultaneously with CS had
significantly better survival than those to whom
immunosuppressive agents were added if CS
alone did not result in a favorable response.38 In
our study, all patients were treated with CS alone
or the combination therapy of CS and immuno-
suppressive agents except for PMX-DHP therapy.
The decision regarding the choice of immunosup-
pressive agents was made by the attending physi-
cians, and the types and amounts of the agents
and timing of the administration varied by the
individual cases. Those variations in therapeutic
regimen may have affected the responses to ther-
apy and outcomes. Finally, because of referral
bias, our study group may have been composed of
patients who had more severe or complicated dis-
eases; thus, the results of our study may not gener-
ally apply to patients in other settings.
Conclusions
In summary, the use of PMX-DHP therapy in
combination with conventional therapy, includ-
ing CS and immunosuppressive agents, gave a
90-day mortality rate of 41.5% in patients with
RPIPs, which was an improvement over the
66.7% rate for conventional therapy. Nonetheless,
it is more important to note that half of the
patients still died of respiratory failure within a
few months, despite the use of aggressive combi-
nation therapies, including PMX-DHP. Further
studies are needed in a large-scale, randomized,
controlled study to confirm the effect of PMX-
DHP treatment and to develop better therapeutic
management for patients with RPIPs.
