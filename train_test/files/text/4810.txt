Abstract: For more than 5000 years, people have cultivated flowers although there is
no known reward for this costly behavior. In three different studies we show that
flowers are a powerful positive emotion "inducer". In Study 1, flowers, upon
presentation to women, always elicited the Duchenne or true smile. Women who
received flowers reported more positive moods 3 days later. In Study 2, a flower
given to men or women in an elevator elicited more positive social behavior than
other stimuli. In Study 3, flowers presented to elderly participants (55+ age) elicited
positive mood reports and improved episodic memory. Flowers have immediate and
long-term effects on emotional reactions, mood, social behaviors and even memory
for both males and females. There is little existing theory in any discipline that
explains these findings. We suggest that cultivated flowers are rewarding because
they have evolved to rapidly induce positive emotion in humans, just as other plants
have evolved to induce varying behavioral responses in a wide variety of species
leading to the dispersal or propagation of the plants.

Introduction
"...[I]t was the flower that first ushered the idea of beauty into the
world the moment, long ago, when floral attraction emerged as a
evolutionary strategy" (p.xviii)...[one of]..."a handful of plants that
manage to manufacture chemicals with the precise molecular key
An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
needed to unlock the mechanism in our brain governing pleasure,
memory, and maybe even transcendence." (p.xviii) I would be the last
person to make light of the power of the fragrant rose to raise one's
spirits, summon memories, even in some not merely metaphorical
sense, to intoxicate"...(p. 177) (Pollan, 2002).
The proposition that "floral attraction emerged as a evolutionary strategy" for
"pleasure, memory and maybe even transcendence" (Pollan, 2002) is basically the
hypothesis that there is an evolutionary niche for emotional rewards, a niche to which
species far removed from mammals, even flowering plants, may adapt. Few
scientists have taken this hypothesis seriously and few studies question the effect that
flowering plants or other non-humans, (except dogs; Allen, 2003) have on human
emotions. Do flowering plants, in fact, increase positive emotional reaction by
influencing emotional displays such as smiling or, over a longer time period, do they
change moods and also influence socio-emotional functions such as social greeting
patterns or memories of social events? The following studies of social-emotional
responses to flowers begin to examine this proposition and to question the human
emotional environment outside that of human relationships.
Although we know that depriving humans or other social species of species-
specific social contact and emotional support is detrimental to health (Cacioppo et al.,
2000; Spitz, 1946), very little research has been directed to the effects of depriving
humans of other-species sources for emotional support. Humans are embedded in a
larger sensory and social environment than that occupied by their own species.
Depriving humans of non-species emotional support may be as detrimental to human
survival and fitness as depriving humans of any other resource.
A Brief History
In cultures around the world as far back in history as we have any records,
flowers provided emotional information among peoples. Pollen was found in the
graves of Neanderthals suggesting that the flowers had a place in the burial (Solecki,
1971), although the significance of the pollen is still in dispute (Sommer, 1999).
Flowers are expected to convey sympathy, contrition (guilt), romance (sexual intent)
or celebration (pride and joy) (Heilmeyer, 2001). Flowers are also used to express
religious feelings and in some religions are considered the direct route for spiritual
communication. (Stenta, 1930). Of course, some flowers are used for personal
adornment, both the blossoms themselves and their essences in the form of perfumes.
The vast majority of personal commercial fragrances have a floral top- and/or mid-
note. In spite of some basic survival uses, such as edible or medicinal flowers, most
flowering plants grown in the flower industry in modern times are not used for any
purpose other than emotional. Floriculture crops in the United States accounted for at
least 4.9 billion dollars in sales in 2001 (USDA, 2003). This amount seriously
underestimates the floral economy because it does not include imports.

An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
Naive psychology argues that flowers are desired because of learned
associations with social events. However, the ubiquity of flower use across culture
and history and the lack of easy substitutes for the many uses of flowers suggest that
there may be something other than this simple association. Flowers may influence
social-emotional behavior more directly or may prime such behavior. That is,
flowering plants may have adapted to an emotional niche.
The Emotional Niche ­ Both the Positive and the Negative
Can one really argue that positive emotion usually has survival benefits or
conveys reproductive fitness? Despite early definitions of happiness or joy as a basic
emotion, the continuing science of the evolution of emotion has emphasized the
negative -- hostile and fearful emotions in animals and depression and hostility in
humans (McGuire, 1993). A larger research literature reports on the stimuli that
govern negative emotions as well as the patterns of response, secondary effects, and
individual differences that emerge in their expression (for reviews, see Lewis and
Haviland-Jones, 2000). It is clear that both plants and animals use defenses that elicit
emotional fear or disgust reactions through the sensory modes of taste and smell,
vision and audition. Snakes and spiders are not necessarily poisonous and the
stinking, slimy mushroom may even be edible. It is not necessary that defense
mechanisms be physically damaging, only that they produce an emotional reaction
leading to avoidance or withdrawal. A plant or animal that can frighten or disgust a
predator has gained fitness by exploiting an emotional niche. Withdrawal without
physical contact is better than an active physical defense, which might lead to damage
or death of the defending species. The ability to produce negative avoidant emotion in
a predator has long been considered a possible defense and could be seen as the
exploitation of an emotional niche.
That positive emotion could operate in a similar emotional niche has emerged
recently but the evidence remains exploratory (Grinde, 2002; Seligman, 2002).
Attraction mechanisms for plants have some socio-emotional features. For example,
Hawk moths (Manduca species.) repeatedly visit Datura flowers (jimsonweed) for a
hallucinogenic reward (Grant and Grant, 1983). Some species of orchids produce
very little nectar and attract pollinators with perfumes. Orchid bees (Eulaema,
Euplusia and Euglossa genera) collect perfumes/pheromones from these orchids into
specialized pouches; they then use the perfumes as sex attractants. Other species of
orchids mimic female sex pheromones and attract males who mate with the flower
(Scheistl, et al., 1999). Interestingly, after "mating" the flowers then produce an anti-
aphrodisiac pheromone (Schiestl and Ayasse, 2001). The well-known bower bird
decorates its nest with flowers (Uy and Borgia, 2000). A number of bat-pollinated
flowers emit a sulfur-like odor that mimics odors used in bat mating and social
recognition (von Helversen, Winkler, and Bestmann, 2000). Many other plants
provide non-nutritional chemical compounds, which insects can use for defense or
sexual attraction (Weller, Jacobson, and Conner, 2000). There does not appear to be

An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
a demonstration of plants providing socio-emotional benefits using similar chemical
or visual mechanisms to humans.
The attraction to flowering plants reflected above may be related to positive
emotion. Panskepp's (2000b) research suggests that non-human species use positive
emotion similarly to humans. "Tickling" rodents elicits high pitched "laughter." This
laughter is related to the appropriate neurological patterns for positive emotion, and is
attractive to other members of the same species. Rats will prefer to approach a
human caretaker who is a "tickler" over one who provides food and water. In other
words, the immediate elicitation and expression of emotion even coming from
another species is related to secondary social attraction effects. The secondary effects
of positive emotion are demonstrated in a large number of behavioral domains for
people as well as for rodents (Panksepp, 2000a). Positive emotion makes people
appear to be more attractive, even sexually attractive and arguably, more likely to be
approached socially. (Cunningham, Barbee, and Philhower, 2002; Otta, Abrosio, and
Hoshino, 1996).
Both short and long-term expressions of positive emotion are related to
secondary effects of positive mood. For example, cognitive processing that is
inclusive and exploratory (Isen, 1987) often accompanies or follows positive
expressions. Positive mood also improves memory processes (Isen, 1999; Levine and
Burgess, 1997) and serves as a buffer against stress. Those who are induced to be
positive will recover more rapidly from stressors (Folkman and Moskowitz, 2000;
Fredrickson, 2000). Also, the long-term expression of positive moods leads to a
prolonged involvement in an ongoing activity, and several researchers have argued
that happiness is related to feelings of safety and would therefore be associated with
social gathering and caring for infants (for reviews see Ekman and Davidson, 1994).
Finally, happy people are more likely to get married, thereby establishing families
(Mastekaasa, 1992).
Thus, happiness in humans facilitates both immediate and long-term social
and cognate functions (Fredrickson, 2002; Izard and Ackerman, 2000; Panksepp,
2000a) and may lead to long-term survival benefits. Health benefits are often
documented in laboratory studies of animals other than humans. For example, Poole
(1997) suggests that unhappy animals are often physiologically and immunologically
abnormal, and Hockly et al. (2002) found that the environmental enrichment of lab
mice slowed the progression of Huntington's chorea in genetically engineered mice.
Environmental enrichment also is known to upregulate genes involved with neuronal
growth (Rampon et al., 2000). There is a growing body of evidence supporting the
need for a positive emotional environment for optimal health, social and cognitive
processes. If positive emotion has these effects, then human emotional needs are a
niche to which other species can adapt.
If flowering plants are exploiting a human emotional niche, it must be shown
that they directly influence emotional states and thereby, also beneficially influence
secondary cognitive and social behaviors. It is the goal of our research studies to
demonstrate that some plants, notably domesticated flowers, have a strong effect on

An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
emotional state and influence secondary cognitive and social behaviors.
Measurement of Positive Emotion
The measurement of emotion, particularly positive emotion, is reliably done
in several ways. Positive expressive movements among humans are reliably measured
with facial movement, particularly smiles. The smile is the easiest facial movement to
recognize. This is especially important when the movement is brief and embedded in
ongoing activity. Self-reports of moods are also reliable when longer mood states are
measured.
The Duchenne smile is consistently related to positive emotion in humans and
is a reliable indicator of happiness, whether or not the happiness can be self-reported
(Dimberg, Thunberg, and Elmehed, 2000). For example, Messinger, Fogel and
Dickson (2001) showed that the Duchenne smile is associated with reciprocal positive
emotion because it is displayed by infants when their mothers are also smiling.
Williams et al (2001) argue that the Duchenne smile elicits a hardwired reciprocal
response in observers. The Duchenne smile functions both as a shared
communication as well as an individual response to positive stimuli. It is a reliable
indicator of the ability of a stimulus to elicit immediate positive emotion.
In the course of research on fear stimuli Dimberg and Thell (1988) used
pictures of snakes for fear stimuli, and pictures of flowers for neutral stimuli. They
found that flowers were not neutral but had effects on rapid changes in facial
musculature. They reported that the facial EMG reaction to the flower stimuli is
zygomatic muscle activity (smile), which they refer to as a positive response.
Dimberg and Thell did not conclude that the study participants exposed to the flower
picture were happy because a genuine, or "true" smile (the Duchenne smile) also
requires orbicularis oris movement (movement around the eye), which they did not
measure. It is possible that they inadvertently discovered a positive emotional
stimulus in flowers. This immediate response needs to be tested with further study of
the facial response to determine whether the response is indeed the Duchenne smile.
This will be one of the first tests we use in Study 1.
If people respond to cultivated flowers with a Duchenne smile, it would be a
strong indicator that flowers are an immediate stimulus for positive emotions. Then if
interviews and self-reports corroborate the positive effects, this is evidence for long
term or secondary effects on mood.
Goals of the Studies
In the following studies we first (Study 1) compare the emotional influence of
cultivated flowers with that resulting from comparable objects which supply more
basic needs such as food or warmth. We predict that the influence of cultivated
flowers on human mood should be powerful both immediately and long term. To
measure immediate emotional change we observe smiling behaviors; to measure

An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
longer-term mood change we measure mood before receiving a floral bouquet and 3
days afterwards.
In Study 1 we use only female participants; however, if the flowering plants
fill a human emotional niche, the effect should, at least partly, overcome local social
convention such as gender. Though women are the usual recipients of flowers in 21st
Century North America and thought to be more responsive to flowers, this may be
related to the perception (or bias) that women are more emotionally responsive
generally (Brody and Hall, 2000). Such a bias only reinforces the hypothesis that
flowers influence emotion, but does not eliminate the possibility that men can be
influenced similarly. In Study 2 we hypothesize that the positive emotional effects of
flowers should generalize to men. Finally, if the effect on emotional state is
powerful, we predict that the moods produced by cultivated flowers would have
positive effects on social behaviors. In Study 2 we measure emotional and social
behavior in a naturalistic observation.
The goal of Study 3 is to expand our information about secondary effects to
the cognitive area. It also examines the long-term impact of repeated exposure to
flowers (i.e. the dose effect). In the third study we provide people living in senior
living residences with flowers. We predict that the flowers will have both a long-
term effect and a short-term effect on mood. Further we predict that the secondary or
spiraling mood changes will influence social behavior and episodic memory.
Study 1 ­ Immediate Smiles and Long Term Mood Change
To test the effects of flowers, we compared the immediate and long-term
emotional behavior of participants who received floral bouquets to the behavior of
participants who were presented with flower-irrelevant control stimuli.
Method
Participants
The participants were 147 adult women evenly distributed across three age
groups (20-39; 40-59, 60+). Nearly all participants were white (n = 137); 2 were
"African Americans", 5 were "Asian Americans", and 3 were "other". Women were
chosen for several reasons: (1) they are more facially expressive, making the coding
of their immediate emotional response more reliable; (2) they are more likely to
report shifts in moods, especially negative moods (Brody and Hall, 2000) and (3)
women are the more common recipients of flowers in the local culture. The
participants were recruited through alumnae newsletters, newspaper advertisements
and postings in grocery stores and churches in the New York-New Jersey
Metropolitan Area.

An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
Stimuli
The mixed-flower bouquet (including roses, lilies and stocks) was chosen
after consultation with the Society of American Florists about the most popular
bouquets. A mixed-flower bouquet has a variety of colors and odors and should
maximize the effect across a diverse group of participants. An initial focus group of
15 women, ages similar to those of the experimental participants, listed stimuli that
could substitute for flowers. This initial group was joined by an additional 15 women
and these 30 women rated all the stimuli on similarity to flowers. The focus groups
selected (1) a fruit and sweets basket (food) and (2) a large, multi-wicked candle
(light, heat) on a stand. The selected stimuli had some of the traditional traits of
domesticated plants -- food and fuel. Chocolate sweets were not selected because
ratings were split, either very high (desirable) or very low (undesirable due to
allergies or weight consciousness). The selected stimuli were uniformly rated high.
The stimuli all had the same economic value, had some pleasant odor, had variation
in color, and were wrapped similarly for presentation in clear plastic with colorful
bows.
Measures
Mood Measures. The 24-item Differential Emotion Scale (DES)-long form
(Izard, 1971) is divided into 8 subscales representing 8 primary emotions. Each item
expresses a feeling, such as "felt like what you're doing or watching is interesting."
The DES was developed to measure changes in normal moods rather than
dysfunctional ones. A participant was asked to indicate how often she had felt "each
of these feelings" in the past 2-4 days, ranging from "0" (Never) to "4" (very often).
The Life Satisfaction Scale (LSS; Diener and Larson, 1984) is a 5-item scale
including statements such as "So far, I have gotten the important things I want in
life." The participant was asked to indicate the extent of her agreement with each
statement on a 5-point bipolar scale ranging from "Strongly disagree" to "Strongly
agree."
Assessment of Secondary Behaviors. A series of open-ended questions
assessed the possible influence of the floral bouquets on secondary behaviors. During
the last interview, participants rated the extent and type of social support they had
experienced within the last 2-3 days. These included questions about intimate
contacts (i.e., people with whom participants had close relationships such as family or
friends), relaxation activities, creative activities, and amusements. This interview
also included questions about the placement of the stimulus in the home and the use
of the stimulus.
Coding the Immediate Positive Emotion. In the first 5 sec after presentation
of the stimulus, the coder recorded the presence of (a) the Duchenne smile
(zygomatic and orbicularis oris movement), or (b) the zygomatic smile alone (no
movement of the muscle orbiting the eye) or (c) no smile. The duration of the

An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
movements within the 5 sec was not coded, only their occurrence. These facial
muscles are easily discerned and coded even by untrained people. With training, the
coding is highly reliable (Ekman, Friesen, and Davidson, 1990; Frank, Ekman, and
Friesen, 1993).
Procedure
Participants were recruited for a study about normal daily moods. At initial
contact, participants answered demographic questions and scheduled the delivery of
the stimulus to their homes. They were told they would receive a gift for their
participation, one of 10 possibilities, but were not told which one. All participants
agreed to be interviewed by phone three times, including the initial contact. Both
interviewers and participants were blind to the stimuli.
Initial Interview Prior to Stimulus. About 10 days before the presentation of
the stimulus, the participant was interviewed by an experimenter who had no
knowledge of which stimulus would be given to that participant. The experimenter
asked the participant to respond to items on both the DES and the LSS.
Stimulus Delivery. Two experimenters delivered the stimuli to the homes of
the participants on a prearranged schedule. One presented the stimulus and the other
coded the type of smile. The presentation was double blind -- blind to the participant
until the moment of presentation and to the coder before and during the presentation.
The person holding the box with the stimulus had her entire upper body and face
blocked by the box so she was unlikely to give any cue as to the contents. The
stimulus was in a large box with one open side. This side was turned away from the
participant and from the coder. When the participant had her attention on the box, the
open side was turned towards her but the contents were still not visible to the coder.
This method of presentation allowed us to focus on the response activated by the
stimulus rather than the response to the delivery people. The coder noted the type of
smile in the initial 4-5 seconds after the stimulus was uncovered.
Follow-up Interviews. The second interview occurred 2-4 days after the
delivery of the stimulus. The interviewer was neither a coder nor a presenter of the
stimuli and remained blind to which stimulus the participant had received. The
participant again responded to the DES and the LSS. This interview also included
open-ended questions to assess social support as a possible secondary effect and to
determine use of the stimulus.
Results
Immediate emotional reaction
In the 5 sec following the presentation of the stimulus, 100% of the
participants in the flower group responded with the Duchenne smile indicating
happiness. The Duchenne smile was common in response to all the stimuli but there

An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
was some variation in response to the other stimuli; 10% of participants receiving
fruit and 23% of participants receiving the candle did not respond with a Duchenne
smile. The differences between the groups is very significant (2 (2, N = 147) =
14.21, p = .007). There were age-related preferences to the control items. Older
participants were more likely to display the Duchenne smile when presented with
fruit baskets than the younger (2 (4, N = 98) = 9.74, p = .045). For the candle, age
differences were marginally significant. Younger participants were more likely to
smile than the older ones (2 (4, N = 98) = 8.99, p = .061). In a few cases, we became
aware during interviews that some participants preferred another stimulus. However,
stated preferences apparently had no effect on the universal Duchenne response to the
flowers.
Mood Interviews
All groups of participants showed an expected decline in the intensity of
emotions from the first interview to the second. All ts on negative emotion were
greater than 2.02; all ps were less than .05; there were only marginal effects for
positive emotions (see Diener and Larson, 1984, on retesting moods). Only the
Participants who received the flowers reported an increase in positive emotion on the
DES inventory (i.e., enjoyment, M = 0.22, -0.44, and -0.54 for flowers, fruit, and
candle respectively; F(2, 139) = 3.95, p = .02).
All three groups had higher scores on the LSS at the second interview than at
baseline (t(146) = -4.32, p = .001). This is an overall study effect and there was no
significant interaction by stimuli.
During the second interview we also asked questions about the use of the
stimuli. The flowers were at least twice as likely to be placed in communal space, that
is, places such as the foyer, the living room or dining room. Flowers were not very
likely to be placed in the most private spaces such as baths, bedrooms or inside
cupboards, whereas the other stimuli were more likely to be in private space than in
communal space (2 (2, N = 147) = 20.35, p < 0.001). Participants who received
flowers were more likely than those receiving the other stimuli to answer positively to
social support questions (e.g. contacting people, talking intimately) after they
received the flowers than before (2 (2, N = 147) = 7.35, p = .05). On the other hand,
there were no changes in responses to questions about engaging in amusements or
relaxation. These results from the interviews suggest that the flowers influence
secondary socio-emotional behaviors as well as having a strong effect on immediate
emotional behavioral expression. However, these were post-hoc analyses requiring
further study.
Discussion
The Duchenne smile is common on the presentation of all the stimuli as

An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
expected; however, the highest (100%) response rate occurred to flowers. The only
longer term increase in positive moods reported was for those who received flowers.
There were additional indications that flowers were different from other stimuli.
Follow-up interviews indicated that people who received flowers placed them in
communal spaces more often and slightly changed their social behavior.
Study 2 ­ Social Behavior and Flowers: The Elevator Study
In Study 1, we only included female participants and we only observed one
behavior, the smile. It appeared from post-hoc analyses that a broader range of social
behaviors might be affected. To expand and confirm the results, in Study 2 we
included men as well as women as recipients of flowers. We collected data on the
Duchenne smile and other social indicators such as proximity and initiation of
conversation. We believed it would be difficult to obtain self-reports of any positive
effect of flowers on men in this society when flowers are viewed as very feminine
and are seldom presented to men. In the second study we observed Participants being
handed single flowers or an alternate stimulus in a constrained social situation - an
elevator. The norms for social distance are well established (see Hall, 1966; Sussman
and Rosenfeld, 1982), and this is certainly true of public spaces (Burgess, 1983)
including elevators. Popular knowledge suggests that the most typical behavior for
elevators that are sparsely occupied is for strangers to retreat to opposite corners. We
predicted that the smile would occur more for the flower while social distance would
decrease, and that the behavior of men and women would be comparable.
Method
Participants
Participants were 122 individuals (60 males, 62 females) who entered a
university library elevator alone. Because of the study's focus on naturalistic
observation, participants were not made aware that they were being observed. Thus,
no age or ethnicity data were obtained; however, the ages of people in a university
library will tend to be towards the early 20s, but not exclusively. In this large East
Coast University, there are representatives of many ethnic groups.
Stimuli
By random assignment, participants were observed in one of four conditions.
(1) In the flower condition, participants received one Gerber Daisy. Gerber or
Transvaal daisies are characterized by bold colors and blooms 4-5" across, although
there is little odor. (2) In the exposure condition, participants were exposed to a
basket of Gerber Daisies, but did not receive anything. (3) In the alternate stimulus
condition, participants were not exposed to flowers, but received a pen with a
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 3. 2005. - 113 -
An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
university inscription. (4) In the no-exposure condition, participants were not exposed
to flowers, nor did they receive anything; neither a basket nor a sign were present.
Flowers and pens were always held in a flat basket. A sign was attached to the
basket, "Free Flowers/Gift! The Society of American Florists Supports a Random Act
of Kindness Day! People will be receiving flowers/gifts at random, on the elevator.
You can pass on the kindness!" In the pen condition, the sign did not include a
reference to the Society of American Florists.
Measures
Facial Reaction. At any time after the participant entered the elevator, the
female experimenter could note a smile. As in Study 1, three types were recorded: (a)
no smile, assigned a value of 0; (b) a polite smile, involving zygomatic muscle
movement but no movement of the muscle orbiting the eye, assigned a value of 1;
and (c) a Duchenne smile, involving both zygomatic and orbicularis oris movement,
assigned a value of 2. Experimenters returned smiles but did not initiate them. The
smile with the highest rating was the only one recorded.
Proxemic Behavior. After the elevator began moving, the participant's
proximity to the experimenter was recorded. This was the farthest position taken by
the participant after the conversation was initiated and the participant stopped moving
into the elevator. The elevator floor was divided into five semi-circular sections with
very small grid marks using clear tape, radiating out from the experimenter's location
by the elevator button. The grid marks were easily visible to the experimenters who
had placed them but were not likely to be noticed by others. Grid 5 was designated as
the area where participants may have touched the experimenter; grid 1 was when the
participant leaned on the farthest wall in the corner of the elevator. The grids were
arranged 24 inches apart. Proximity was coded on a scale from 1 (farthest away) to 5
(closest or touched experimenter) according to the participant's location in the
elevator.
Initiation of Conversation. After the initial comments made by the
experimenter, any conversation initiated by the participant was coded. Superficial
remarks such as "Thank you" or "A flower?" were not coded as initiated speech but
treated as a response to the experimenter. If the participant initiated conversation
beyond the experimenter's first greeting, a value of 1 was assigned for conversation
initiation; if not, a 0 was assigned. Experimenters responded politely but briefly.
Eye gaze/head orientation. Experimenters noted whether participants were
directing their gaze toward them by noting head orientation, recording this as toward
the experimenter or away/up/down. Again this was noted in the same time frame as
the proximity rating ­ after the elevator moved and after the first response to the
experimenter. If the experimenter observed gaze at or in the direction of the
experimenter's face from the participant, a value of 1 was assigned for the presence
of an eye gaze, otherwise, a value of 0 was assigned.

An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
Total Social Score (TSS). Individual scores for (a) type of smile, (b)
conversation initiation, (c) proximity to the experimenter, and (d) gaze/head
orientation to experimenter were summed to obtain a Total Social Score (TSS) which
served as the main dependent variable for the experiment (Cronbach's  = .70,
indicating adequate reliability). The possible range for TSS was from 1 to 9.
Procedure
Only one stimulus condition was run per day. On those days when
flowers/stimulus were presented, flower/stimulus presentation and flower/stimulus
exposure/no presentation were alternated. An individual who entered the elevator
became a participant if s/he entered the elevator alone.
Two experimenters were present. A male experimenter held the basket and
positioned himself next to the elevator control panel. A female experimenter stood
next to him holding a clipboard for recording data. The experimenters' placement in
the elevator did not vary. In the flower/stimulus presentation conditions, the male
experimenter initiated conversation according to a pre-constructed script. He also
handed the flower or pen to the participant. In the exposure/no presentation and
control conditions, he said: "Hi, which floor would you like?" After this brief
question or stimulus presentation, the experimenters did not speak except in response
to the participant. The female experimenter recorded proximity, conversation, facial
movement, and eye contact on a standardized coding sheet. If a participant asked the
female experimenter what she was writing, she responded that she was keeping a
record of gift recipients for the Society of American Florists. This gave participants
the opportunity to request that nothing be recorded about them.
Results
TSS Scores
A 4 (condition) x 2 (gender) analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a highly
significant difference on TSS by condition, F(3, 114) = 31.41, p = .0001.
Examination of the means by group indicates that the highest levels of social
behaviors were displayed in the flower-receiving condition, followed by the pen-
receiving condition, the no stimulus condition, and finally the flower-exposure
condition. There was also a significant main effect for gender, F(1, 114) = 9.79, p =
0.002, such that across all conditions, women had, on average, higher TSS than men
(for women: M = 4.55, SD = 2.06; for men: M = 3.70, SD = 2.06). However, there
was not a significant condition by gender interaction, F(3, 114) = 1.86, p = 0.14,
indicating that both men and women were as likely to respond with more social
behaviors when receiving flowers versus receiving pens or receiving nothing.

Individual Analysis of Social Behaviors
Type of Smile. When all social behaviors were analyzed separately, this
pattern of results was strongly maintained. For type of smile, there was a significant
difference in the distribution by condition (2(6, N = 122) = 42.73, p = 0.001). Those
who received flowers were more likely to respond with the Duchenne smile than
those in the other conditions, including those who received pens (simple effects, 2(2,
N = 122) = 8.72, p = .01). There were no significant gender differences in smile
types (p = 0.10).
Proximity and Initiation of Conversation. In terms of proximity and initiation
of conversation, those who received flowers stood closer to the experimenter and
were more likely to initiate conversation than those in all other conditions (2(12, N =
122) = 43.64 and 2(3, N = 122) = 33.38, respectively, both p's = 0.001). Simple
comparison of the stimuli-receiving conditions showed proximity was significantly
closer for those who received flowers versus those who received pens (simple effects,
2(4, N = 61) = 14.05, p = 0.002), while differences in the likelihood of conversation
initiation were marginally significant (simple effects, 2(1, N = 61) = 2.98, p = 0.08).
Direction of Head. Finally, for gaze/head direction, there were significant
differences by condition (2(3, N = 122) = 14.41, p = 0.01), but simple effects
comparisons indicated that the presence of gaze direction did not differ between those

An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
receiving flowers versus pens (2(1, N = 61) = 1.01, n.s.). Thus, while receiving an
object from a stranger elicits eye contact regardless of the type of stimulus, it was
flowers alone that elicited a higher level of social behaviors including type of smile,
proximity, and initiation of conversation.
Discussion
Contrary to cultural expectation, both men and women presented with flowers
(as opposed to a pen or with nothing) were more likely to smile, to stand at a social
distance rather than at an impersonal distance and to initiate conversation. Men are
not expected to prefer flowers, yet they show the same pattern of smiling and
approach in Study 2 as women. The prediction that the mere presence of flowers
would be positive was not supported. The field notes suggest that participants were
disappointed not to have received a flower. We had two cases of individuals in this
condition returning to the elevator and asking for a flower. A better test of the
presence of flowers that is not contaminated with such expectations is needed.
While the presentation of flowers seems to have more effect on behavior than
comparable stimuli, it is possible that this is a very short-term effect. In Study 3, we
test the effects of repeated exposure to flowers. We also expand the potential
influence of the positive affect induced to include cognitive consequences.
Study 3 ­ Secondary Effects of Flowers on Senior Retirees: Social and Cognitive
Consequences
While the presentation of flowers seems to have important socio-emotional
effects on behavior, it is possible that this is largely due to the unusual experimental
presentation. People in Study 3 receive two, one or no flower bouquets over a 2-
week period. To follow up the social effects seen in the previous studies, in this third
study we asked participants to keep daily diaries of social interactions. We also
predicted secondary effects of the flowers on cognitive function. If there are
generalizing effects of the flowers on moods, then they might affect episodic memory
as well as sociability. Depression is known to have negative effects both on social
interaction (Reifler, 1994) and on memory (Backman et al., 2000; Gotlib, Roberts,
and Gilboa , 1996; Watts, 1995). If negative mood or depression is responsive to
flowers, then we predict that there are both social and cognitive secondary effects
related to the positive mood increases.
To further demonstrate the predicted secondary effects of flowers on moods,
we used a participant population of senior retirees. In this population generally, the
rate of depression is underreported (Friedhoff, 1994), withdrawal from social events
occurs as a result of such depression (Reifler, 1994) and there is a general decline in
episodic memory production (La Voie and Light, 1994; Spencer and Raz, 1995;
Zacks, Hasher, and Li, 2000).

Method
Participants
We recruited 113 participants (93 women and 10 men). Their average age
was about 73 years (14 Ss aged 55 - 65; 30 Ss aged 65 - 75 and 69 Ss over 75 years).
The oldest person giving her exact age was 93 (many declined to give exact ages).
Among these, 104 completed the interview part of the study and 91 also completed
and mailed the daily logs. Dropping out usually occurred because of a death in the
family or illness (no participants died during the study). We removed one participant
whose materials had been completed by a relative. Most of the sample was
European-American (90), but there were also 7 Asian-Americans, 4 African-
Americans, one Native American and 3 "other". Participants were recruited from
retirement communities, from community centers offering programs for seniors,
through community video announcements and through postings in stores, churches,
and alumni newsletters.
Stimuli
All participants received at least one bouquet, which was identical to the most
popular bouquet in Study 1. One group received a second bouquet. The second
bouquet was composed of mixed flowers but was monochromatic yellow.
Participants were assigned to one of four stimulus conditions. (1) In the primary
stimulus condition, the early group, participants received bouquets only the first
week, 2-3 days after the baseline interview (to assess the long-term deterioration of
the flower effect). (2) In the delayed stimulus condition, the late group, participants
received bouquets only the second week, 2-3 days after the second interview (to
assess stability of moods and the addition of flowers to the environment). Together,
these two groups were the "one flower" group. (3) In the repeated stimulus condition,
the "all flowers" group, participants received bouquets after the first and second
interviews (to assess "dose" effects of flowers). (4) In the no-stimulus condition, the
no-flowers group, participants received bouquets only after the experiment was over
(to determine baseline measures of normal mood changes without flowers). A florist
delivered the bouquets.
Measures
Focus Groups. We pre-tested the measures on older participants since most
of them were designed originally for use with college students. Eight women over age
60 who had participated in Study 1 collaborated with us. None of them would be
included in Study 3. We went over the goals and methods of Study 3 with them and
asked them to do two things. First, we asked them to pair up so that one person
would act as the interviewer and the other as the interviewee. They then performed
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 3. 2005. - 118 -
An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
the whole interview making note of any problems, including length, and then
suggested ways to correct them. Any interview questions that were difficult to
understand or objectionable were reworded or eliminated. Second, we asked them for
a general critique of the research and for advice on recruitment. From this, we
developed the social logs and the episodic memory tasks.
Mood Measures. Both the DES and the LSS administered in Study 1 were
again administered in Study 3 (see Study 1 for descriptions).
Social Contact Logs. We prepared booklets to help participants keep records
of daily social encounters. The information in the booklets also would comprise test
items to be recalled for the episodic memory tasks (see below). Participants noted
each social contact, making separate entries for 8 categories: family, friends, medical
personnel, household services, neighbors, shopkeepers, religious contacts, delivery
people, and other. The booklets were entitled "Social Contact Log" with a yellow
cover page that included clearly written directions. The contents included 4 pages
with 3 or 4 rows of boxes along side each category. Instructions were to begin filling
out the log for Week 1 on the day of the interview and to start the log for Week 2 on
the day of the second interview. The pages for Weeks 1 and 2 were distinguished by
differently colored decorative borders. We mailed each participant the booklets and
required a record at least 4 days out of every 7. We included a stamped envelope for
their return and reminded participants during phone contacts to complete the logs and
return them.
Episodic memory measure. The memory assessment included three sets of
memory questions: (a) memory of the flowers (did not include the group who had not
received flowers, of course); (b) memory of the booklets used for the daily social
contact logs; and (c) memory of a social event that had been indicated on the logs.
The set of flower questions asked the participant when they had been received and
then asked for comments on "special things" about the flowers. For those participants
who had received flowers, one point was given for recall of types of flowers, one for
colors, one for the round glass vase and one for the ribbon on the vase. This score was
kept separate and used to compare to the other memory score. The set of questions
about the booklets included the number of entries per week, the week the booklets
were received in the mail, as well "special things" about the booklets. Points were
given for naming a category, for describing an icon, for giving the paper color, and
for describing the border design. The set of questions about social contacts scored
points for describing specific parts of the object or event. Points were given on the
memory-for-social contact set of questions if the participant responded with a
particular person, time, event and place. One prompt, if necessary, was used to elicit
more complete information. The participant received a composite score for the event
and the booklet recollections.
Procedure
The interviews were double blind. The participant did not know to which
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 3. 2005. - 119 -
An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
group s/he had been assigned (although this became evident over time). Interviewers
never knew to which group the participant was assigned. We asked the participants
not to tell the interviewer whether or not they had flowers until the memory task,
which included questions about the flowers; this was the last task. The person who
scheduled flower delivery was separate from the rest of the lab.
Interviews. The initial contact with the participant simply scheduled
interviews and obtained an address so that we could mail the participant a copy of the
interview materials, the social contact logs, as well as notify the florist for flower
delivery. At the first baseline interview, we obtained baseline data on moods, health,
social support, life satisfaction and some demographic description. The interviewer
would also make certain that all the materials had arrived and were understood. The
interviewers let the participants set the pace for the interviews. There were two more
interviews, about a week apart. The second interview was the same as the baseline
interview, excluding demographic information. In the third and final interview, we
also included the memory task.
Results
Mood Interview
We predicted that the mood effects seen in Study 1 would be replicated. In the
first study we compared the group receiving flowers with groups receiving other
stimuli. Here we collapsed the groups who received flowers (early or late or both
early and late), comparing them with the group who had not received flowers. As
expected, the participants who had received flowers had significantly more positive
moods (DES scores for happy and interest questions minus depression -- sad, shame,
guilt, self-hostility) than participants who had not yet received flowers (t(102) = 2.07,
p<.041). Comparing the groups separately with the no-flowers group reveals trends;
examination of means illustrates that these trends are in the expected direction.
Participants who had received flowers early reported more interest and happiness (M
= 5.24, SD = 3.5) than participants who had not (M = 3.72, SD = 3.3). At the end of
the second week all participants who had received flowers again report more interest
and happiness (M = 5.39, SD = 3.3) than those without flowers (M = 3.9, SD = 3.9).
There is some evidence that increasing the number of bouquets is additive.
On the DES depression score (sad, shame, guilt, and self-hostility) score, 81% of
participants who received both bouquets, as well as 64% of participants who received
one bouquet, had lower depression scores than they did at the pretest. Only 57% of
participants who had not received flowers (i.e., about half the "no flowers group"
increased and half decreased their scores, as expected by chance). These slight
differences in the direction of shift between the groups are significant (2(2, N = 104)
= 6.14, p = 0.05). There are no other significant effects on mood or life satisfaction.
The other negative affect factors of the DES are not significantly different; the Life

Satisfaction Scale showed no differences.
Social Contact
There were no significant differences by group on the number of social
contacts. We hypothesized that the potential for change in social contacts might be
very limited for most of the Participants who resided in retirement homes.
Episodic memory--secondary mood effects
Since the mood shifts were found to be most significant between participants
who received flowers at all and those who had not, the sample was collapsed into 2
groups, those who had received flowers by the last interview and those who had not.
The difference in memory score between these two groups is highly significant. (t(3)
= 3.75, p = 0.001; M = 0.77, SD = 0.88, no flowers condition; M = 1.06, SD = 0.88,
flower condition). The secondary effect is as strong or stronger than the reported
mood shift.
Discussion
The third study replicates Study 1 in that people receiving flower bouquets are
happier and perhaps less depressed than people who do not receive bouquets. People
who received two may be happier than people who received one. This suggests that
the effects found in Studies 1 and 2 are not due simply to surprise, nor do effects
dissipate rapidly when more flowers are provided.
Study 3 provides additional evidence that the increase in positive emotion
related to the flowers will have secondary benefits. Participants who received the
flowers had higher scores on the episodic memory task than those who had not yet
received any bouquets.
Even though we collected daily diaries to report on social interaction and even
though an examination of the diaries suggested that a subgroup of socially active
senior residents increased their social contacts, there was no effect overall. The social
interactions of the people in the retirement community are very regular due to
scheduled visits and planned activities. It is possible that the effect would be seen in
other contexts with less regimented social interaction. This remains a question for
further research.
General discussion
There is very little extant theory that lends itself to an easy explanation for the
effects of flowers on positive socio-emotional change as found in our three studies.
Any explanation of our findings must consider the puzzling strength of the effect of
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 3. 2005. - 121 -
An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
receiving flowers. In the double-blind design of Study 1, female participants received
one of three possible stimuli. Every participant who received flowers responded with
the Duchenne smile in the first 5 sec after the visual presentation. Although it is true
that the Duchenne smile is the most common response in all stimulus conditions, it
occurs significantly more often for the flower presentation, having occurred in every
instance. This response was replicated in Study 2 when male and female participants
received a single flower. Again the Duchenne smile occurred significantly more
often, although it did not reach the 100% response rate found in Study 1. These
findings are particularly intriguing because the Duchenne smile is referred to as the
"true" smile and is related to changes in brain chemistry and various
psychophysiological indices (Dimberg, Thunberg, and Elmehed, 2000). Our results
indicate that the simple presentation of flowers, even a single flower, will release a
strong and immediate behavior reflecting positive affect. Given the presence of the
Duchenne smile, it is possible that the flowers--either through their visual or odorous
qualities--have effects on brain chemistry.
As mentioned, Study 2 extends the results of Study 1, showing that even a
single flower presented to men or women will elicit a Duchenne smile significantly
more often than other stimuli (a pen or nothing). This second study, a naturalistic
observation conducted in a public elevator, also investigated other social behaviors.
These included the distance participants stood from the experimenter, their initiation
of conversation, and their looking towards the experimenter. All these social
behaviors increased when a flower was presented. Again, this is intriguing,
particularly the findings regarding social distance, since the norms for social distance
are well established (see Burgess, 1983; Hall, 1966; Sussman and Rosenfeld, 1982).
The most typical behavior for elevators that are sparsely occupied is for strangers to
retreat to opposite corners. That flowers in particular closed the distance between
strangers is remarkable. That this did not occur when pens were presented indicates
that the receipt of a stimulus in itself did not change the relationship between
strangers. It was something about the flowers.
Study 3 provided additional evidence that the increase in positive emotion
when flowers are presented is substantial. In the third study, most participants were
residents in retirement and assisted living settings, though a few still resided in the
community while attending senior programs. Demographically, many people in this
age group are somewhat depressed and may have decrements in their cognitive skills
(e.g., Backman et al., 2000). Nevertheless, presenting flowers continued to have a
positive impact on mood. This was sustained or perhaps improved when a second
presentation was made. Those participants who received flowers had higher scores
on episodic memory tasks.
Anecdotally, the responses are even more fervent than the behavioral
observations have indicated. Some participants responded with such unusual (for
experimental studies) emotional displays that we were unprepared to measure them
and have only field notes to indicate their presence. The delivery experimenters
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 3. 2005. - 122 -
An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
reported that they received hugs and kisses for the flowers. Florists also tell us that
this is common. We were invited to return to the participants' homes when they were
"off duty" for refreshments. We received attractive "Thank you" cards and letters
from several participants who received flowers for allowing them to be in the study,
some with photographs of the flowers, one with multiple photographs to show the
continuing beauty of the bouquet. In many years of studying emotions, we have
never received hugs and kisses, thank you notes or photographs, not even for candy,
doughnuts, decorated shirts or hats, gift certificates, or direct monetary payment; the
flowers are different.
Theoretical Explanations
Given that there is little theory to guide us, what explanations might we
present for these findings? We suggest that the explanations fall into three categories:
(1) simple learned associations of flowers with positive social events, (2) associations
of flowers with food that could be part of an evolutionary response promoting food
search, and (3) flowers as specially evolved human sensory mood enhancers. We will
review the evidence and rationale for each possibility.
Learned Associations. We cannot eliminate the strong possibility that the
global symbolic meaning of the flowers leads to a positive learned response. Our
attempt to use men as a test of differential learning of positive responses to flowers
may not be sufficient. It may be necessary to find a society or group of people who
do not use flowers in any symbolic way, if possible. Since the mere presence of
flowers in study two did not elicit positive social behavior, it remains possible that the
learned association between flowers and giving is accounting for much of the effect.
The design of study two apparently created an expectation in participants that they
would receive a flower. When they did not, the disappointment was palpable. A
research design that looks at the effect of flowers in pubic spaces, or perhaps along
roadsides, where there is no expectation that they will be given to individuals might
answer this question. But even if it is the case that the effect is purely an associative
one, it is still somewhat surprising that there are such strong positive mood effects
and secondary benefits simply following the receipt of flowers. This associative
explanation evades the question about how flowers in comparison to other positive
objects, such as food or other highly desirable gifts, have come to have stronger
positive emotional associations across cultures and history.
Evolutionary food association. Rather than hypothesize a simple learned
association of flowers and positive social habits, one might hypothesize that there has
been some evolutionary advantage to the attraction of flowers in their relation to
fruits and other food products. For example, Orians and Heerwagen (1992) suggest
that aesthetic preferences for landscapes and potentially other growing things are
related to early hominid survival when these environmental cues would be related to
foraging success. Thus, flowers would be preferred because humans became hard-
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 3. 2005. - 123 -
An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
wired to "emotionally" appreciate "beauty" associated with food gathering.
Orians and Heerwagen (1992) postulate that flowers would evoke a positive
response (joy), that predicted future food supplies and possibly a better place for
rearing progeny.
Pinker (1997) makes a similar suggestion that the attraction to flowers is
hardwired into our brain because flowers directly signal the future availability of
fruit, nuts, or tubers. Humans remember where and when flowers were observed to
obtain food in the future. The strength of this argument is mitigated by the fact that
mammals find food with all their senses, most of which are of more immediate use
than long term memory for key environmental features (Stiles, 2000). More to the
point, the showy flowers that humans seem to find especially attractive generally do
not produce edible fruit.
Instead of the association being either learned or innate, we could take a
middle position that humans are biologically primed to associate flowers with
happiness. Under this condition, recognition of flowers would not be hard-wired, per
se, but aspects of flowers would easily become associated with happiness and it
would be very difficult to associate flowers with negative emotions (Cook and
Mineka, 1987).
Mood Enhancers. Our last explanation takes a different approach but is in
some ways an extension of the middle position. The third hypothesis is that various
sensory elements of flowers combine, even serendipitously, to directly affect mood.
The effect would occur even if a flower were a de novo event in a human experience.
Using this explanation, flowers prime positive psychological responses because they
are "super stimuli," directly affecting moods through multi-channel sensory
interactions (or one of the channels alone might be able to carry the effect). It would
be easy to learn positive associations, but the general mood effect would be predicted
to occur without learning.
Most of the sensory attractors lead partially or entirely to changes in mood.
This process places moods or emotions in a central position for the evolution or even
co-evolution of plants and people ­ a process that is useful for the results of our
studies. This theory is congruent with Panksepp's (2000a) concept of an affective
consciousness. According to Panksepp, there are primal neural networks in the
posterior thalamic, tectal and periaqueductal regions of the mesencephalon that
constantly process emotional information. Organisms seek this information. Sensory
stimuli such as visual symmetry, color, odor, and pheromones provide the
information sought and affect moods. We will briefly examine some examples of
these sensory stimuli as they are not often used to explain socio-emotional results.
With respect to symmetry, Enquist and Arak (1994) argue that we have an
evolved preference for patterned symmetries because these can be detected easily as a
recognizable signal within in a wide variety of visual arrays. In other words we are
attracted to symmetry. The ease of recognition and the familiarity engendered should
be associated with improved mood, as well as easy identification (see Zajonc, 1980;
for the rationale for an association of familiarity and emotion). There does not need to
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 3. 2005. - 124 -
An Environmental Approach to Positive Emotion: Flowers
be an established memory or association to the flower in order for there to be a
positive effect. It is the symmetrical pattern alone that is important. One might look
at it from the point of view of the flowering plant and describe the effect as one in
which the plant uses symmetry to attract a human for seed or tuber dispersal or to
protect the plant from predators or dangerous environments. Ultimately, then the
plant that only has a preferred symmetry, even if it has no other product, potentially
can be protected and dispersed by humans. The result for humans is improved mood.
Similarly, we may have preferences for certain colors based on the primate
trichromatic color visual system. Such a preference might have evolved because the
various color channels are important in finding ripe fruit against a green background
(Osorio and Vorobyev, 1996; Parraga, Troscianko, and Tolhurst 2002) or in
distinguishing high protein leaves (Dominy and Lucas, 2001). Again, the preferences
for particular colors may be separated from their use in spotting food and become
rewarding more generally. Plants with preferred colors that have no other products
would be protected and dispersed. Plants with preferred colors and symmetry may
become "superstimuli" with the combination.
We might also have a preference for specific floral odors. To our knowledge
this has not been extensively studied within the psychological literature for perception
and sensing although perfumers have shown that differences in preferences exist (see
Jellinick, 1997). Obviously, humans use olfactory information and relate this to other
sensory information. The coordination of olfactory and visual cues is known to
influence neurological responding. For example, Sarfarazi et al (1999) showed that
the amplitude of the P400 visual event related potential was decreased if the odor cue
did not match the visual cue. Considered alone, specific odors seem to modulate
moods (see Baron, 1997, Schiffman et al., 1995; Shiffman, Suggs and Sattley-Miller,
1995; Freyberg, Wilson, and Haviland-Jones, under review). Schiffman and her
colleagues have shown that popular colognes that often have a floral topnote will
reduce depression, and Freyberg, Wilson, and Haviland-Jones have shown that
certain putative pheromones or fragrances can reduce negative moods, for example.
There is also the possibility that humans might be sensitive to the effects of
floral social chemicals. We have long known that a variety of species are responsive
to pheromones produced by plants to mimic sex pheromones. The perfume
manufacturers have believed for centuries that humans are sensitive to such
pheromones and use pheromonal animal products as the base for fine perfumes (e.g.,
civit, musk). Several researchers have demonstrated mood effects of androstodienone
on women (Jacob and McClintock, 2000; Wilson et al., under review; Freyburg,
Wilson, and Haviland-Jones, under review). Such social chemicals might function in
courtship and increase social behaviors, as well as affecting moods.
Plants are sometimes considered to be biological chemists. Their chemical
make-up is rapidly responsive to other species, time of day, and other variables. They
could certainly use chemical or visual cues to attract humans. Following the
argument that plants have significant, largely unexplored chemical potential, Wilson

The natural products of plants and animals are a select group in a
literal sense. They represent the defense mechanisms and growth

Is it reasonable to propose that plant-human co-evolution or even domestication is
based on socio-emotional rewards? There are many instances of such plant and
animal relationships, though they are not usually thought of in this way. Plants may
reward animals for defending them. For example, the "swollen thorn" acacia trees of
Central America have large thorns which can be used for ant nests. Their leaves have
nectaries, which produce nectar consumed by the ants. In return the ants attack any
herbivores and even remove vegetation around the trees. If the ants are removed, the
plants are soon killed by predators (Janzen, 1966).
Plants attract animals for a variety of reasons and by a variety of methods.
Plants utilize animals for pollination, seed dispersal and protection. While the vast
literature on the attractiveness of flowers has been focused almost entirely on insect
pollinators, some flowers attract vertebrate pollinators. For example, a number of
bat-pollinated flowers emit a sulfur-like odor that mimics odors used in bat mating
and social recognition (von Helversen, Winkler, and Bestmann, 2000). At least one
flower, Mucana holtonii, reflects and focuses bat sonar signals to attract pollinators
(von Helversen and von Helversen, 1999). Other flowers attract hummingbirds with
color; such flowers tend to be red, have symmetrical tubular flowers, and provide a
heavy nectar flow.
A wide variety of plants utilize vertebrates as seed dispersing agents (Stiles ,
2000). Plants have a variety of powerful mechanisms that could affect mood
positively and attract animals for seed dispersal -- including color, odor or even
sound. For many plants, including flowering plants, humans are the primary seed-
dispersing organism. To our knowledge, humans are the only organism that routinely
digs up, divides and replants tubers, bulbs and corms of flowers. Some domesticated
flowers may have become dependent upon humans for propagation (Comba et al.,
1999). For example, cultivated orchids are a highly selected and preferred flower that
is hand pollinated by humans. Orchids have a sensory attractiveness but little or no
food or medicinal usefulness for people. These scattered features continue to suggest
that plants can attract people even if there is no reward in terms of food, medicine,
shelter and so forth. Plants may only enhance or prime positive moods.
The idea that flowering plants with no known food or other survival value
have coevolved with humans by using an emotional niche spawns a couple of

predictions that can be addressed in future research. First, domesticated flowers
should, in general, be better at inducing positive emotions than their progenitors.
Second, different flowers will induce their effects through different combinations of
modalities. Some might be primarily visual. Others might be visual and olfactory.
Some may even mimic human pheromones. Given the wide HLA variation among
humans in responses to odor (Jacob, et al., 2002), it is also likely that humans vary in
their responses to particular flowers. There may be gender and ethnic effects as well.
An extensive literature search for research on why certain flowering plants are
selected for domestication or propagation yields almost nothing. Many books and
articles discuss the domestication of plants useful for humans in food, medicine,
shelter and so forth; the notable exception is the domestication of flowers. We
suspect this is part of the general neglect of emotional processes as major contributors
to biological evolution. Flowers cultivated by humans occur in the wild in disturbed
ground. Usually they are weeds taking cultivated land away from
edible/burnable/constructive produce. If the flowers induced positive emotions they
might have been allowed to remain in or near the cultivated fields. The loss in food
production due to weeds would have been offset by an increase in positive emotion.
The selected offspring of these pleasing plants might have become even more
pleasing. We hypothesize that as flowers moved into the new niche created by
agriculture there was an increase in variation and the more pleasing and attracting
flowers were allowed to remain. At some point humans might have moved from
merely tolerating these weedy species to actively saving and sowing the seeds. It has
not escaped our attention that the scenario we present for the evolution of flowers is
very much like the scenario that Budiansky (1994) presents for the evolution of dogs.
Flowers may be the plant equivalent of companion animals.
Our hypothesis is that cultivated flowers fit into an emotional niche - their
sensory properties elicit human positive emotions. The flowering plants are thereby
rewarding to humans and in return, the cultivated flowers receive propagation that
only humans can provide. Demonstration of such a phenomenon fills several gaps in
the literature. It supports the basic significance of emotion for survival. As a corollary
it supports the adaptive function of positive as well as negative emotion. Finally it
opens an area of investigation into the psychological relationships between humans
and other species through their sensory properties that have been relatively neglected.
