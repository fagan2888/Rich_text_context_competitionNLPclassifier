Abstract
Objective: Prostate cancer is a malignant tumour that poses a serious risk to human health.
Epidemiological studies suggest that it may be associated with vitamin D receptor gene (VDR)
polymorphisms. Previous work investigated potential risks between Taq I (rs731236) and Bsm I
(rs1544410) VDR polymorphisms with prostate cancer in humans; however, results are inconsistent.
Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis to retrieve genetic association analyses of rs731236 and
rs1544410 polymorphisms with prostate cancer from studies published between 2006­2016.
Pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were used to assess genetic associations, and
heterogeneity was assessed by Q and I2statistics.
Results: Our findings suggest a significant association between rs731236 and prostate cancer risk
in Asians and African Americans, but rs1544410 was not associated with prostate cancer under
three genetic models.
Conclusion: Future studies including larger sample sizes and the analysis of gene functions are
needed to help develop prostate cancer treatment.

Introduction
Prostate cancer originates from epithelial
cells and is a serious threat to human health.
Its incidence in China was reported to be
9.92/10 million in 2012, representing the
sixth most common male malignant tumour.
Similar incidences were also seen in the
United States, where 192,000 new cases of

prostate cancer were reported in 2009
according to the American Cancer
Society.1 In recent years, numerous medical
studies have made important progress in the
field. Clinical studies showed that the inci-
dence of prostate cancer increases with age,
with a high incidence of disease concen-
trated in individuals 70­80 years of age.
However, patients with familial hereditary
prostate cancer are usually less than 50 years
old.2 An increased disease incidence is also
related to frequent sexual activity, a high-fat
diet,3 race, and regional location.
Molecular biology and epidemiological
studies results suggest that the pathogenesis
of prostate cancer may be associated with
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
several genes.4­8 For example, polymorph-
isms of the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR)
are closely associated with prostate cancer.
VDR is located on human chromosome 12
and encodes the nuclear hormone receptor
for vitamin D3.9,10 VDR is a ligand-depen-
dent nuclear transcription factor, which
plays an important role in maintaining
calcium metabolism, and regulating cell
proliferation and differentiation.11 Several
SNPs have been identified in VDR that
appear to influence the risk of cancer and
other disease,12,13 including bone mineral
density, hyperparathyroidism, and osteoma-
lasia.14­16 In normal and malignant prostate
cells, VDR expression mediates the bio-
logical actions of 1,25(OH)2D,17­19 and
polymorphisms in different regions of VDR
cause different effects. The Bsm I
(rs1544410) restriction site is in intron 8 of
VDR; this polymorphism does not affect the
amino acid sequence of VDR, but many
studies have suggested that it is closely
related to prostate cancer risk.20­23 The
Taq I (rs731236) polymorphism is a syn-
onymous mutation located in VDR exon 9,
which is also associated with prostate cancer
risk.20,24­29
Several studies have investigated the
potential risk of Taq I (rs731236) and Bsm
I (rs1544410) polymorphisms on prostate
cancer worldwide. However, the results are
inconsistent.30­32 Therefore, we conducted a
new meta-analysis to assess the effect of
these two SNPs on the risk of prostate
cancer.
Materials and methods
Search strategy and data extraction
We carried out a search of the literature to
retrieve association analyses of Taq I
(rs731236) and Bsm I (rs1544410) poly-
morphisms with prostate cancer published
between 2006­2016. We searched PubMed,
Springer, and ScienceDirect databases using
the search terms `Taq I (or rs731236)', `Bsm I
(or rs1544410)', `prostate cancer', and `asso-
ciation analysis'. For data extraction, we
paid attention to the publication time, coun-
try of publication, population information,
genetic models used, case and control
sample size, and polymorphism genotype
and allele frequencies.
Statistical analysis and meta-analysis
We detected allele frequencies by Hardy­
Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using
the 2 test. Ideally, allele frequencies
were stable and unchanged (P > 0.05).
Heterogeneity was tested for using Q
and I2 statistics, with P < 0.05 indicating
significant difference. In the absence of
heterogeneity, the fixed-effects model was
used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of
each study; otherwise the random-effects
model was used. The strength of associ-
ation between Taq I (rs731236), Bsm I
(rs1544410), and prostate cancer was
accessed by calculating pooled ORs and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) under
additive, dominant, and recessive genetic
models. Publication bias was tested by
Begg's test and Egger's linear regression.
STATA software (version 12.0) was used
for statistical analysis.

Results
Data statistics
A total of eight case­control studies about the
Taq I (rs731236) polymorphism and the rela-
tionship between prostate cancer were identi-
fied.30­37 These included a total of 1,720
prostate cancer patients (502 Asians, 829
Caucasians, and 389 African Americans) and
1,729 controls (730 Asians, 866 Caucasians,
and 133 African Americans). A total of six
case­control studies about the Bsm I
(rs1544410) polymorphism and the relation-
ship between prostate cancer were identi-
fied.30,32­35,37 These included a total of 1,555
prostate cancer patients (350 Asians, 816
Caucasians, and 389 African Americans) and
1,376 controls (369 Asians, 870 Caucasians,
and 137 African Americans). In these studies,
the Bsm I (rs1544410) allele frequency was in
line with the HWE (2 test, P> 0.05)
(Table 1).
Meta-analysis and publication bias
The results of the associations between
Taq I (rs731236) and Bsm I (rs1544410)
polymorphisms with prostate cancer and
heterogeneity are shown in Table 2 and
Figures 1­3. Our meta-analysis suggested
that Taq I (rs731236) is associated with
prostate cancer in the Asian population
(dominant model: OR ¼ 1.618, 95% CI
1.071­2.445, P ¼ 0.022) and African
American population (recessive model:
OR ¼ 1.668, 95% CI 1.115­2.496,
P ¼ 0.013) under the dominant model and
recessive model, respectively. However, Bsm
I (rs1544410) was not associated with pros-
tate cancer under any of the three genetic
models (additive model, OR ¼ 1.005, 95%
CI 0.746­1.353, not significant (NS); dom-
inant model, OR ¼ 1.237, 95% CI 0.753­
2.031, NS; recessive model, OR ¼ 0.906,
95% CI 0.623­1.316, NS).
We used Begg's test and Egger's linear
regression to estimate the publication bias.

Discussion
Several previous studies have reported an
association of the Taq I (rs731236) and Bsm I
(rs1544410) polymorphisms with prostate
cancer.20­29 However, other investigations
reached the opposite conclusion.30­32 In the
present study, we conducted a meta-analysis
of recently published genetic association
analyses. The results suggested that Bsm I
(rs1544410) was not associated with prostate
cancer under the additive, dominant, or
recessive genetic models. These negative
association results could be explained by
our method of identifying studies from the
literature, or could reflect the fact that we did
not analyse other prostate cancer risk factors

such as atmospheric pollution, autoimmune
diseases, and dietary factors. Moreover, the
observed heterogeneity may also explain why
no association was detected between Bsm I
(rs1544410) and prostate cancer risk.
We did reveal a significant association
between the Taq I (rs731236) polymorphism
and prostate cancer risk in both Asian and
African American populations (Table 2 and
Figures 2­3). In 1994, Morrison et al.38
reported that the Taq I (rs731236) poly-
morphism affects VDR transcriptional activ-
ity and mRNA stability, thus altering the
abundance of VDR protein, and in turn
affecting vitamin D levels. Low vitamin D
levels have been shown to increase the risk of
prostate cancer,39 which agrees with our
meta-analysis findings and previous epi-
demiological studies and gene function
research.
By extension, our results show that gen-
etic association analysis between suscepti-
bility loci and disease involving small sample
sizes does not provide solid evidence.
Increasing the sample size would avoid the
false-positive results obtained from local
samples. Larger investigations should there-
fore be conducted together with molecular
function studies of susceptibility genes
and loci. This will ultimately provide an
important theoretical basis for the develop-
ment of prostate cancer clinical treatment.
