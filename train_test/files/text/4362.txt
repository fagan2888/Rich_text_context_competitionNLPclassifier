Article
Perfectionism has been variably described as striving for
flawlessness, high standards for performance, and the ten-
dency to be excessively critical regarding self-evaluations of
behavior (Flett & Hewitt, 2002; Frost, Marten, Lahart, &
Rosenblate, 1990; Hewitt & Flett, 1991; Stoeber & Otto,
2006). Numerous quantitative analyses on perfectionism
demonstrate positive correlations between perfectionism and
psychopathology, particularly anxiety, depression, and eat-
ing disorders (Boone, Soenens, & Luyten, 2014; Kawamura,
Hunt, Frost, & DiBartolo, 2001; Klibert, Lamis, Naufel,
Yancey, & Lohr, 2015; Luo, Forbush, Williamson, Markon,
& Pollack, 2013). Although extensive quantitative (numeri-
cal) research on perfectionism exists, there is comparatively
little qualitative (nonnumerical) research. The present study
used a qualitative design analyzed using thematic analysis
(Braun & Clarke, 2006) to develop a greater understanding
of how perfectionistic individuals define and are affected by
their perfectionism.
What Is Perfectionism?
Perfectionism is frequently conceptualized as a multidimen-
sional construct, with variation in its conceptualization
among researchers (Flett & Hewitt, 2002; Frost et al., 1990;
Hewitt & Flett, 1991; Slaney, Rice, Mobley, Trippi, &Ashby,
2001; Stoeber & Otto, 2006). One popular approach uses
factor analysis to combine many different perfectionism
measures into two latent dimensions. For example, Stoeber
and Otto (2006) proposed two latent variables, which each
represent a "family" or "constellation" of subtraits derived
from an array of different research traditions. Perfectionistic
Strivings includes demanding perfection of oneself, achieve-
ment striving, and having high personal standards.
Perfectionistic Concerns, often conceptualized as the more
maladaptive dimension, includes excessive concern over
mistakes, doubting the quality of one's actions, self-criti-
cism, a feeling of falling short of one's own high standards,
and feeling others demand perfection of oneself. Some
authors suggest that categorical personality types can be
derived from these two dimensions, with three-category
models being common, including (a) nonperfectionists, who
have low levels of both dimensions; (b) adaptive perfection-
ists, who have high levels of Perfectionistic Strivings and
low levels of Perfectionistic Concerns; and (c) maladaptive
perfectionists, who have high levels of both perfectionism
dimensions (e.g., Rice & Ashby, 2007).
Various studies have identified positive relationships
between perfectionistic concerns, perfectionistic strivings,
and numerous psychopathologies, such as depression,

Perfectionism and Life Narratives: A
Qualitative Study
Julia R. Farmer1, Sean P. Mackinnon1, and Megan Cowie1
Abstract
We examined how perfectionistic people conceptualize perfectionism and narrate life events using thematic analysis.
Participants included 20 university students who qualified as highly perfectionistic based on cutoffs on the Almost Perfect
Scale­Revised (n = 6 adaptive, n = 14 maladaptive). Participants completed a qualitative interview. Using thematic analysis,
we identified five themes regarding participants' conceptualization of perfectionism. The most common themes supported
prior theory (high personal standards, performance is never good enough), along with a few comparatively understudied
themes (being neat and orderly, feels superior to others, gets caught up in the details). We also identified five themes in a
life narrative interview (relationship success, relationship problems, agentic redemption, agentic contamination, and academic
success), which provided insight into how young, perfectionistic university students create meaning and identity through
autobiographical narratives. "Relationship success" themes were most central to adaptive perfectionists, whereas "agentic
redemption" themes were most central to maladaptive perfectionists.

anxiety, and eating disorders (Asseraf & Vaillancourt, 2015;
Wade, Wilksch, Paxton, Byrne, & Austin, 2015). Similar
findings have been found for categorical perfectionism mod-
els. For example, Gnilka, Ashby, and Noble (2012) found
that anxiety was highest for maladaptive perfectionists and
lowest for adaptive perfectionists, with nonperfectionists
falling somewhere in between. By further examining how
these dimensions manifest within qualitative data, we hope
to better understand the impact of perfectionism in the lives
of highly perfectionistic people.
Qualitative Research on Perfectionism
Although considerable quantitative research on perfection-
ism exists, the body of qualitative research is much smaller
(Mackinnon, Sherry, & Pratt, 2013). Speirs-Neumeister
(2004) used inductive data analysis to examine what factors
contribute to the development of Socially Prescribed and
Self-Oriented Perfectionism. Socially Prescribed
Perfectionists described being subjected to authoritarian par-
enting styles and witnessing parental perfectionism. These
individuals displayed preconceived expectations of their par-
ents having demanding expectations for them, their self-
worth as being dependent on achievement, and a fear of
disappointing others. In addition, participants suggested
parental perfectionism, experiencing mastery of early aca-
demic experiences without effort, and a lack of previous
experience with academic failure were precursors to Self-
Oriented Perfectionism.
Egan, Piek, Dyck, Rees, and Hagger (2013) used qualita-
tive analysis to explore perfectionists' motivation to change
their standards and cognitions after failure. They conceptual-
ized negative perfectionists as a clinical sample whose per-
fectionistic behavior functioned as negative reinforcement
(Slade & Owens, 1998). Athlete perfectionists were the com-
parison group. High negativity perfectionists demonstrated
more dramatic, catastrophic, and negative reactions when
having experienced negative consequences (Egan et al.,
2013). Moreover, negative perfectionists tended to make
negative internal attributions of failure, whereas the athletic
group made more external attributions (e.g., blaming the
weather).
Mackinnon et al. (2013) conducted a longitudinal mixed
quantitative and qualitative analysis exploring whether per-
fectionists expressed increased themes of agency (power,
status, achievement, self-mastery) and difficulties in the
domain of communion (friendship, support, mutual dialogue,
togetherness). First-year university students completed a
semistructured autobiography interview (McAdams,
Hoffman, Day, & Mansfield, 1996) and questionnaires at the
beginning and end of term. Themes of agency within the nar-
ratives were positively correlated with Perfectionistic
Concerns, Perfectionistic Strivings, and Perfectionism
Cognitions. However, dimensions of perfectionism were
uncorrelated with themes of communion.
Merrell, Hannah, Van Arsdale, Buman, and Rice (2011)
conducted a qualitative analysis to assess the thoughts and
feelings of 14 maladaptive perfectionists using the consen-
sual research paradigm (Hill et al., 2005; Hill, Thompson, &
Williams, 1997). There were a number of common themes
(e.g., stress about perceived academic inadequacy, avoidant
coping, interactions with loved ones, and perfectionism) pro-
viding insight into how maladaptive perfectionists express
their feelings through narrative.
Life Narratives
Most personality research focuses on traits (i.e., features of
personality that remain stable across time and contexts)
using self-report questionnaires and quantitative analysis.
However, some have criticized this narrow focus, suggesting
that life narratives (i.e., autobiographical stories about one's
life) are essential to understanding the whole person.
McAdams and Pals (2006) proposed an integrative model of
personality that incorporates other features beyond traits.
This model describes three core features of personality: (a)
dispositional traits (traits that change little across contexts
and time), (b) characteristic adaptations (context-specific
responses to life events, such as goals and values), and (c)
life stories (how one narrates autobiographical events).
Unlike other personality theories, it highlights the impor-
tance of autobiography when understanding personality.
Most researchers have focused on correlates of trait per-
fectionism (Cruce, Pashak, Handal, Munz, & Gfeller, 2012;
Page, Bruch, & Haase, 2008; Stoeber, Otto, & Dalbert, 2009)
and how these traits interact with aspects of perfectionists'
goals, values, and motivations (Clark, Lelchook, & Taylor,
2010; Rice, Richardson, & Clark, 2012; Stoeber et al., 2009).
However, research on perfectionists' life narratives is sparse.
Examining these narratives will provide a novel perspective
into the lives of these individuals, and how their perfection-
istic traits manifest within their autobiographical narratives.
Thus, the study of highly perfectionistic individuals using
McAdams's (2008b) Life Narratives Interview is likely to
advance our understanding of perfectionism.
The Current Study
Research exploring how perfectionists narrate their lives is
sparse. Existing qualitative research has important limita-
tions. Prior qualitative research has not generally asked par-
ticipants to define perfectionism. Instead, researchers have
either defined perfectionism for the participants (Egan et al.,
2013) or focused on auxiliary issues such as achievement
goals (Speirs-Neumeister, 2004) or stress and coping (Merrell
et al., 2011). Moreover, (Egan et al., 2013; Merrell et al.,
2011; Speirs-Neumeister, 2004) and has not compared and
contrasted the experiences of adaptive versus maladaptive
perfectionists. To address these gaps, the present study asked
both adaptive and maladaptive perfectionists to define
Farmer et al. 3
perfectionism and to describe whether they viewed it as a
positive or negative influence in their lives. We also com-
pared the overall life themes of adaptive and maladaptive
perfectionists using the Almost Perfect Scale­Revised (APS-
R) cutoffs (Rice & Ashby, 2007), which represents a novel
contribution to the literature.
Prior research has also tended to eschew broader metathe-
oretical issues in personality psychology (cf. Mackinnon
et al., 2013). McAdams and Pals (2006) asserted that devel-
oping a complete understanding of the individual's narrative
identity is crucial for understanding the whole person, and a
core component to studying personality. Therefore, by exam-
ining life narratives, the current study will develop a better
understanding of the "whole perfectionist." The present
study is thus also in line with a broader theoretical perspec-
tive in personality psychology that advocates for the integra-
tion of life narratives into research on human personality.
The present study examined the narrative identity of
highly perfectionistic individuals, using a combination of
open- and closed-ended interview questions and utilizing
thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Our research
questions were as follows:
Research Question 1: How do people high in maladap-
tive or adaptive perfectionism define perfectionism?
Research Question 2: What major themes emerge in the
autobiographical narratives of people high in perfectionism?
These questions were left open-ended to allow for fortuitous
findings and to decrease chances for preconceived researcher
biases to influence the data interpretation (Maxwell, 2009).
Method
Selection Criteria
Our selection criteria were based on cutoff scores on the
APS-R (Rice & Ashby, 2007; Slaney et al., 2001). Eligible
participants were required to meet cutoff scores for an adap-
tive or maladaptive perfectionist. Adaptive perfectionists had
to score 42 or higher on the Standards subscale and less than
42 on the Discrepancy subscale. Maladaptive perfectionists
had to score 42 or higher on both the Standards and
Discrepancy subscales. Participants were administered the
APS-R twice, once during prescreening via an online survey,
and again when arriving at the lab. When determining eligi-
bility for the study based on Rice and Ashby's (2007) cutoff
scores, we calculated the average of prescreening and labora-
tory scores on the APS-R. Two participants did not meet eli-
gibility requirements after arriving at the lab (i.e., their
average perfectionism scores were lower than the cutoff of
42). These two participants were omitted from the analysis.
A third participant was classified as an adaptive perfectionist
at prescreening but was reclassified as a maladaptive perfec-
tionist after the APS-R was readministered in the lab. This
participant was retained as a maladaptive perfectionist. All
other participants had the same perfectionism classification
they were assigned at prescreening. Our goal was to collect
data from 20 participants, with an equal number of adaptive
and maladaptive participants. Due to difficulty in finding
participants who met the criteria for adaptive perfectionism,
more maladaptive than adaptive perfectionists were actually
recruited.
Given our selection criteria, mean scores on Standards
were high for adaptive perfectionists (M = 46.58, SD = 2.91)
and maladaptive perfectionists (M = 47.14, SD = 1.90). Mean
scores on Discrepancy were high for maladaptive perfection-
ists (M = 71.48, SD = 10.32), but not for adaptive perfection-
ists (M = 29.00, SD = 5.13). Although Rice and Ashby's
(2007) cutoff scores are well validated, they were normed on
an American population, rather than a Canadian population
of students. Mean Discrepancy scores from the mass testing
pool collected at Dalhousie University during the same year
as the present study (n = 858, M = 47.85, SD = 14.14) tended
to be larger than the sample from the southeastern United
States (n = 1,532, M = 39.80, SD = 15.22) reported in Rice
and Ashby (2007). Indeed, the mean Discrepancy scores at
Dalhousie University exceed the cutoff for maladaptive per-
fectionism suggested by Rice and Ashby (2007). This may
suggest a social context of heightened perfectionism at
Dalhousie University.
Participants
Twenty perfectionistic participants (six adaptive, 14 mal-
adaptive) were recruited from the student population at
Dalhousie University via flyers and online advertisements.
This student sample was primarily young (M
age
= 20.02
years, SD = 2.67) and female (n = 15), with participants
reporting their ethnicity as Caucasian (n = 14), Asian (n = 5),
or Caribbean (n = 1). They had a variety of university majors,
with the most common being psychology (n = 7). Moreover,
four participants (all maladaptive perfectionists) indicated
that they were currently receiving treatment from a mental
health professional.
Materials
APS-R. The APS-R is a 23-item scale that measures facets of
perfectionism. In the present study, we used two subscales
from the APS-R: Standards ("I have high standards for my
performance at work or at school") and Discrepancy ("I
often feel frustrated because I can't meet my goals"). Partici-
pants responded to items on the APS-R using a 7-point scale
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The
APS-R has high reliability, demonstrating high internal con-
sistency for each of the subscales (Standards:  = .85, Dis-
crepancy:  = .91; Slaney et al., 2001). The APS-R also has
excellent sensitivity and specificity when used as a categori-
cal measure using cutoff scores (Rice & Ashby, 2007).
4 SAGE Open
Perfectionism interview questions. There were three sections of
interview questions used to address our two research ques-
tions. In the first section, we used a combination of open and
closed-ended questions to assess participants' understanding
of perfectionism. The specific questions were as follows: (a)
How would you define perfectionism or perfectionistic peo-
ple? (b) Do you think you are a perfectionistic person? Why
or why not? (c) Do you know anyone other than yourself
who is a perfectionistic person? Why do you think they are
perfectionistic? (d) What are the best things about someone
being a perfectionist? (e) What are the worst things about
someone being a perfectionist? These author-generated ques-
tions were adapted from a prior qualitative study on perfec-
tionism (Rice, Bair, Castro, Cohen, & Hood, 2003).
Life narrative interview. The life narrative interview is a short-
ened, semistructured interview that was created by using
questions from McAdams's (2008a) life story interview. We
asked participants about nine critical life events from this
interview: a high point, a low point, a turning point, a mis-
take story, a drinking story, a positive childhood memory, a
negative childhood memory, a parent story, a same-sex friend
story, and "other important person" story. A high point is a
moment in which participants experienced positive emo-
tions, such as joy, excitement, happiness, inspiration, or deep
inner peace. A low point is an event in which participants
experienced negative emotions, such as despair, disillusion-
ment, fear, or guilt. A turning point is an episode in which
participants undergo an important change in the way they
understand themselves. A mistake story is a story where a
person feels he or she made the wrong choice. The two child-
hood scenes (positive and negative) are similar to high and
low points, but must occur during childhood or early adoles-
cence. The mistake story was author generated, following the
same framework as the questions developed by McAdams
(2008a). The final three relationship narratives were adapted
from previous studies conducted by Mackinnon, Nosko,
Pratt, and Norris (2011) and Mackinnon et al. (2013). A rela-
tionship defining scene is an event or experience with a par-
ticular individual that "illustrates what the relationship is all
about." We asked about relationship defining scenes in three
domains: (a) a parent, (b) a same-sex friend, and (c) any
other important person not discussed so far.1
Procedure
This study has received ethics approval from the Dalhousie
University University Health Sciences Research Ethics
Board (Health Sciences Research Ethics Board, 2015-3540).
To participate in the study, participants initiated contact via
email after viewing an advertising flyer (n = 15), an online ad
(n = 3), or hearing about it via word of mouth (n = 1). One
person declined to indicate how he or she heard about the
study. All participants were prescreened by completing an
online version of theAPS-R and were admitted into the study
only if they met Rice and Ashby's (2007) cutoff scores for
adaptive or maladaptive perfectionists (see "Selection
Criteria" section).
Participants came into the lab for approximately 2 hr. The
session was conducted in a single, closed room, with only the
researcher and participant to ensure the participant's privacy.
Participants first read and signed a consent form. Next, par-
ticipants completed pen and paper questionnaires, including
not only the APS-R but also other measures not reported on
in this article. Following the questionnaires, the researcher
turned on the audio-recording device and read aloud the
instructions on the interview protocol. The participant was
given the opportunity to ask questions before beginning both
sections of the audio-recorded interview. A paper containing
question prompts asked during each of the descriptions of the
participants' critical life events was provided to the partici-
pant as a reference. The prompts consist of the following:
"what happened, where it happened, who was involved, what
you did, what you were thinking and feeling, what impact
this experience may have had upon you, and what this expe-
rience says about who you were or who you are." During the
interview, the researcher did not lead the participants'
responses, only prompting them to elaborate if the researcher
felt the participant had not fully responded to the question.
All participants provided consent to use anonymous quota-
tions. Finally, participants received a debriefing form and
were compensated. Compensation consisted of one of three
options: (a) $40(CAD), (b) two bonus points to be adminis-
tered toward qualifying psychology courses via the online
undergraduate participant pool in the Department of
Psychology and Neuroscience at Dalhousie University, or (c)
a combination of $20(CAD) and one bonus point.
The audio-recorded data were transcribed into text format
in Microsoft Word, by the first and third authors. Any infor-
mation that could have been linked back to the participant, or
could have led to their identification (e.g., names, places,
dates), was removed from the transcripts during this process.
All qualitative data analysis used the transcribed interviews.
Qualitative Analysis Strategy
We used inductive thematic analysis to analyze the interview
questions. Thematic analysis involves open-ended qualitative
analysis to summarize the content of the raw interview data
(Braun & Clarke, 2006). The researcher begins the analysis by
familiarizing himself or herself with the raw data (the tran-
script), generating initial codes within the written or spoken
data, and coding sections of the transcript for theoretically
interesting features (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The codes sum-
marize each data item. The researcher is then required to
assemble these diverse codes into holistic themes, which sum-
marize the data in a meaningful way (Braun & Clarke, 2006).
They review the themes to ensure that they have accounted for
all of the codes, proceeding to name and define each theme
until the data are concisely and completely summarized.
Farmer et al. 5
Inductive thematic analysis involves describing data with
as few preconceptions as possible (Braun & Clarke, 2006). A
preconceived notion of what themes to expect may bias the
results, either causing the researcher to miss fortuitous find-
ings, or to unintentionally manipulate the presence of a pre-
dicted theme within the data (Maxwell, 2009). To reduce
bias, we did not attempt to predict the qualitative results of
the study beforehand and instead sought to describe the data
in rich detail. Participants did not provide feedback on tran-
script accuracy, nor the final analysis.
Research Team and Reflexivity
The first author, a female Caucasian who was an undergradu-
ate student at a Canadian university at the time of the analy-
sis, conducted this project as part of her honors thesis. She
was trained in thematic analysis by the second author and
had experience conducting thematic analysis once before in
the nonprofit sector. The first author conducted all of the
interviews and did much of the thematic analysis and writ-
ing. The second author, a male Caucasian university instruc-
tor with a PhD in experimental psychology, supervised the
first author's honors thesis. Although his specialization is
primarily in quantitative statistics, he has also published two
studies using thematic analysis in the context of mixed-
methods designs. The second author was involved in all
aspects of the research design, analysis, and writing. He also
audited the thematic analysis, resolving any discrepancies in
interpretation through discussion. The third author, a female
Caucasian paid research assistant, transcribed the majority of
the data and was currently completing her undergraduate
degree in psychology at the time the study was being con-
ducted. She also assisted with writing and editing the final
manuscript for publication.
Participants had no relationship with the interviewer (first
author), but knew she was completing her honors thesis. As
the study was cross-sectional, participants knew there would
be no further interaction with the first author following the
interviews, and participants were assured that their responses
would be anonymous and confidential. Thus, there was no
preexisting relationship with participants that might bias
results; however, it is possible that the lack of a preexisting
relationship may have resulted in some participants being
more reluctant to fully disclose their feelings during the
interview. Moreover, the first author was not fully blinded to
participants' perfectionism subgroup status, which could
have influenced the interview. The participants did not inter-
act with the second or third author.
We not only ascribed to epistemological constructivism
(i.e., people construct narratives within a sociocultural con-
text) but also assumed the narratives reflected real lived
experiences (ontological realism). This is consistent with
prior research using McAdams's (2008b) life narrative inter-
view, and can be broadly categorized as a "psychosocial"
approach to studying autobiography (Smith & Sparkes,
2008). We preferred thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke,
2006) to language-based approaches such as discourse anal-
ysis (Barker, Pistrang, & Elliott, 2016) because it is more
compatible with our ontological realist stance and our
emphasis on the individual rather than broader societal issues
(Smith & Sparkes, 2008). We preferred thematic analysis to
narrative analysis (Barker et al., 2016) because the perfec-
tionism questions did not produce data that were in narrative
form (i.e., stories with a clear narrative arc). Thus, thematic
analysis was preferred as an approach that could analyze
responses to both the perfectionism questions and the life
narrative interview.
Although all attempts were made to remain unbiased dur-
ing the thematic analysis, it is worth noting that the second
author comes from a theoretical tradition that assumes per-
fectionism is a maladaptive risk factor for psychopathology,
which may bias interpretation to the extent that such a bias is
in turn passed on to his supervised students. Specifically, his
training can be traced back to the Hewitt and Flett (1991)
tradition of measurement and research, which comes with its
own assumptions about the definitions and correlates of per-
fectionism. Moreover, the second author tends to ascribe to a
two-dimensional model of perfectionism (i.e., perfectionistic
concerns vs. perfectionistic strivings; Stoeber & Otto, 2006),
which is commonplace in Canadian research on perfection-
ism. Finally, the classification system created using the
APS-R cutoff scores (Rice & Ashby, 2007) contains implicit
assumptions about the well-being of participants. That is,
"adaptive" perfectionists are thought to have positive well-
being, whereas "maladaptive" perfectionists are thought to
have adjustment difficulties and mental health problems.
Indeed, a value judgment is built directly into the construct
names through the use the adaptive versus maladaptive
labels. This may have influenced the qualitative analysis
toward portraying adaptive perfectionists more favorably,
and maladaptive perfectionists more unfavorably. Attempts
were made to bracket and set aside such assumptions as a
core part of thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006).
However, any such attempt is liable to be imperfect, and
readers are encouraged to keep our assumptions and biases in
mind when interpreting the qualitative analysis.

Thematic Analysis of Perfectionism Questions
We combined data from the five perfectionism questions
together into a single section before analyzing with thematic
analysis. This section of the interview was divided into 166
data items, which were in turn collapsed into five themes. A
full list of all these themes and their descriptions are presented
in Table 1.3 The prevalence of all themes (i.e., the proportion
of participants who endorsed a given theme at least once),
split by perfectionist status, sex, ethnicity, and whether or not
they were seeking mental health treatment, is contained in
6 SAGE Open
Supplementary Table 1. Participants' subgroup status is indi-
cated as maladaptive perfectionists (MP) or adaptive perfec-
tionists (AP) throughout this section to facilitate comparison.
However, because there were not many differences between
the responses of adaptive versus maladaptive perfectionists in
this section of the interview, we describe the themes overall
when collapsed across all participants.
The "high personal standards and goals" theme was the
most common theme. This theme consisted of high expecta-
tions and standards for one's own performance, working
very hard on tasks, and demonstrating a good work ethic. For
example, Participant 11 (MP) described the best thing about
being perfectionistic as ". . . you want to make sure that it
[work] is the best it possibly can be . . ." Although partici-
pants often described these as "high goals," it was also quite
common to highlight the strong work ethic of perfectionistic
people, particularly when asked to describe what is best
about perfectionism.
We called the second largest theme "performance is never
good enough." Here, perfectionists described feeling dissat-
isfied when their performance was inadequate in some way,
usually leading to negative emotions. For example,
Feeling like you're never good enough leads to a lot of feelings
of unworthiness and loneliness because you retreat . . . I ended
up dropping lots of courses in high school because I just felt I
wasn't good enough to even sit in the room and learn the material
because I couldn't learn it as fast as others. (P3, MP)
Although the above quote is an unusually self-punitive
example, this theme always involved a subjective sense of
failing to reach high standards, with negative emotions such
as shame, anger, or depression.
Although the majority of participants described perfec-
tionism using these two themes, there were also a number of
smaller themes endorsed by comparatively few participants.
The most common of these small themes was "being neat
and organized," which refers to a preference for organization
and orderly environments. For instance, one participant
described his or her mother as a perfectionist:
Um, I think my mom is perfectionist (chuckles) [laughs] like
cause she always wants everything in the house clean, like looks
perfect . . . if there's something like just moved like, five
centimeters away from its own place like she would just yell at
me. (P12, MP)
In this example, we can see not only a preference for order
but also displeasure with disorder. This theme also contained
instances where participants were overly meticulous in car-
ing for their physical appearance.
Another theme was "feels superior to others." This
theme had both positive and negative features. For instance,
participants indicated that perfectionism can lead to objec-
tively superior performance and praise from others, usu-
ally when describing what is "best" about perfectionism.
However, participants also described perfectionists as the
sort of people who are highly critical of others. For exam-
ple, one participant describes her father as perfectionistic
because ". . . if I get a good grade that is an A average but
there's one, B+ or A­ or something then he would still
complain about that and ignore the rest of it . . ." (P7, MP).
So this theme is fundamentally social in nature, suggesting
that some perfectionistic people seek praise for their agen-
tic accomplishments, and criticize others for failing to
reach high standards.
Finally, a few participants also described a tendency to
"get caught up in the details." In this theme, participants
described perseverating on small details in tasks, resulting in
work taking longer than expected. Typically, participants
would suggest that this detail-oriented trait was likely to
interfere with other areas of life, such as social relationships.
For example, "spending a lot of time on things, so you don't
have a lot of time for other things . . ." (P20, AP). Overall,
this theme appeared somewhat reminiscent of obsessive
compulsive personality traits.
Thematic Analysis of Life Narrative Interview
The life narratives interview consisted of 544 data items. Of
these items, 31 were highly idiosyncratic or uncodable, and
were coded as "miscellaneous." The remaining data items
were distilled into five themes, which are presented in order
from most to least common. See Table 2 for a full list of all
five themes and their descriptions. The prevalence of all
themes split by selected demographic variables is contained
in Supplementary Table 1. Again, there were no clear differ-
ences between the responses of adaptive versus maladaptive
perfectionists in this section of the interview; thus, we
describe the themes overall when collapsed across all
participants.

Theme 1: Relationship success.The largest theme was rela-
tionship success, that is, positivity regarding relationships
and accepting aid from others. Although the nature of the
relationships varied across participants (e.g., friends, family,
romantic partner), these moments of appreciation for one's
loved ones were treasured as positive memories by all par-
ticipants. Nonetheless, agentic concerns (i.e., personal power
and accomplishment) served as the contextual backdrop for
many of these stories. For example, P15 describes a feeling
of interpersonal closeness after writing a letter to her grand-
parents, but is also proud when the letter was read in front of
others:
. . . my grandmother decided to read the story to my entire
family, and I guess it just made me feel really good that she
thought that it was important enough to share with the other
members of my family. . . . I just feel proud that my grandparents
know that they've made such a difference in my life. (P15, AP)
Although the relationship is clearly quite intimate, the par-
ticipant chooses to emphasize agentic concerns (i.e., feelings
of pride, public acknowledgment) when telling the story.
These agentic concerns may reflect a narrative expression of
perfectionism.
At other times, participants described reaching out to oth-
ers in times of need. For example, P18 failed to make his
high school hockey team and described it as a devastating
low point; however, he felt closer to his mother after express-
ing vulnerability for one of the first times in his life:
Yeah like, made me, realize not to give up. Keep working harder,
and, you know like I'm, I'm not like openly emotional but that
time I think that was like the first time I cried that much in front
of my mom. So that, that made me realize like, that I should be
open with my emotions with family and friends because they
can help. (P18, MP)
This story is deeply entwined with agentic concerns despite
the stated importance of relationships. The negative emo-
tions are described as alien and uncharacteristic, and result
directly from a failure to meet high standards. Yet despite
this negativity, the participant has an important moment of
self-understanding: Expressing vulnerability to loved ones
is okay and might even be helpful. Throughout these stories,
relationship success stories are treasured precisely because
they are rare, or unusual, in the lives of perfectionists. They
are fleeting moments that many participants struggle to
recreate:
The paradox of me always feeling alone but then never asking
for help is kind of like a um, perpetuating cycle . . . If I'm never
asking anyone for help or never letting them know that I need
them then how, like of course I'll always be alone. (P6, MP).
The relationship success theme often followed this general
format, whereby participants lead a life narrowly focused on
agentic concerns, yet have brief, meaningful moments where
the importance of close relationships is brought to the fore-
front of their awareness.
Theme 2: Relationship problems.The second largest theme
was relationship problems, where participants described
relationship conflict and other negative interactions with oth-
ers. Sometimes, conflict was overt with social negativity per-
petuated by the participant, often as a result of holding others
to high standards. For example, one participant recalls being
angry at her younger sibling for exposing her other infant
sibling to her cold virus:
I was just shouting after her and, even though she was already
crying I was just standing there and making her cry even more.
(P22, AP)
The majority of stories with an "overt conflict" subtheme
involved very direct and aggressive behaviors on the part of
the perfectionist that brought him or her into conflict with
others, while a small number contained aggressive instiga-
tion by others.
At other times, participants described how a mistake
ruined successive interactions with others. This pattern is
characteristic of the black-and-white thinking of many per-
fectionistic people. For example, one participant described
the consequences of revealing a friend's secret to others:
. . . I feel really bad about it 'cause it kinda destroyed our trust
between us and after that, I never can talk to her again 'cause she
is really--I heard she is really mad about it. (P12, MP)
These moments of shame and regret about causing friction
with others appeared within the majority of participant narra-
tives within the sample.
At other times, this sort of relationship contamination
centered on the betrayal and wrongdoing of others. In many

cases, participants described becoming less trusting of oth-
ers. For example, a participant recalled repeatedly defending
a friend's honor, only to discover that the friend had been
lying:
. . . it taught me not to put my head on a block for anyone. Even
the people you think you know the most. (P22, AP)
Overall, it was relatively common for participants to describe
becoming less trusting and more cautious of others when
friends failed to meet their expectations within the
relationship.
Theme 3: Agentic redemption. The next two themes centered
on positive and negative aspects of agency (i.e., achieving
goals and personal power by focusing on the self as separate
from others). The agentic redemption theme included
increases in self-confidence and personal growth, generally
after a challenging negative event. In many stories, the focus
was on independence. For example, one participant described
the impact of moving away to university:
. . . helped me grow to be the person I am now. I think that's
really when I became an adult and started thinking for myself
and I stopped listening to what other people wanted me to be.
(P17, MP)
Other stories focused on personal growth through adversity,
where participants found a silver lining in negative situations
(i.e., using events as growth opportunities). One participant
described how he or she chose a program that aligned with his
or her passions, despite his or her parents' disapproval, saying
"I think that's made me a lot stronger, in my convictions and in
my decisions that I make personally because it's clearly been
the right choice . . ." (P19, MP). These stories were common
and often focused on freedom from parental control, a natural
consequence of the young, university student sample.
Theme 4: Agentic contamination.The agentic contamination
theme involved strong negative emotions, where agentic
accomplishments were ruined by events that followed. In
some stories, participants experienced negative emotions or
regret after a perceived failure. For example, one participant
described his experiences writing a book as a low point:
I was happy, but I went back and I started doing the editing
process of, you know, making stuff that wasn't good better and .
. . then somewhere in the realm of editing and improving it, I
decided that it was unsalvageable and not worth keeping and I
deleted all the copies that I had of it. . . . I've described it to a lot
of friends that it was, one of the worst decisions I've ever made
. . . (P11, MP)
Here, there is evidence of rigid black-and-white thinking, with
errors contaminating the entire manuscript, along with intense
regret following the rash decision to delete everything.
At other times, agentic accomplishments were ruined by
situational concerns outside the participant's control. For
example, one participant described how he or she felt after
not making the provincial team when other teammates did:
I just remember feeling really left out, and sad . . . I was thinking
that I wasn't good enough and inferior. (P20, AP)
The perception of not being "good enough" appeared a num-
ber of times, and appeared to be a common sentiment when
participants were faced with failure to achieve a goal.
Theme 5: Academic success.The final theme was academic
success, which centered on either achieving a goal or on
increased motivation to work hard and strive for academic
success. Sometimes, the focus was on achieving an academic
goal, and included feelings of triumph and accomplishment
after hard work. For example, one participant described
achieving his or her goal of becoming valedictorian:
. . . it made me realize that I can achieve my dreams, no matter
how far-fetched it is, and it made me realize that all of my hard
work that I've put in all throughout high school was finally
rewarded through this honorary title. (P18, MP)
Here, public recognition and reward for hard work is empha-
sized. Other stories within this theme centered on an indi-
vidual's motivation to work hard and strive for academic
success. For example, one participant described how he or
she had been fairly indifferent toward academic achievement
before deciding to put more effort into school:
. . . it actually started to make me feel good in the fact that I was
getting better grades, and so I actually started enjoying this work
and learning this stuff . . . really made me see education
differently and that's the point where I decided to go to
university. (P4, AP)
In general, this theme involved experiencing academic suc-
cess, with participants expressing positivity and inspiration
to work hard.
Comparing Adaptive Versus Maladaptive
Perfectionists
Our final analysis compares adaptive versus maladaptive
perfectionists in terms of their overall life theme; specifi-
cally, their response to the question, "Looking back over
your entire life story with its events, scenes, and challenges,
do you discern a central theme, message, or idea that runs
throughout the story? If so, what is the major theme in your
life?" This final question allows us to determine which of the
themes that emerged from our thematic analysis are most
central to the narrative identities of participants.
The overall life themes of adaptive perfectionists were
notable for their positivity and optimism, with every story
Farmer et al. 9
ending on a positive note. Indeed, the theme that cut through
most of these stories was gratitude for good relationships.
Participants felt like they were "lucky," that they had the sup-
port they needed to succeed, and that nothing truly bad had
happened in their own life. Three of six adaptive perfection-
ists described the protective effect of social support in their
own lives. For example,
I've always had people to help me get through things. . . . The
theme of my stories is that, really having people to help you
through and um, that you're not actually alone. (P2, AP)
These stories seem to suggest that the negative events in their
lives were buffered by a strong social support network.
Although one adaptive perfectionist described striving for
excellence as a core life theme, he or she also stressed the
importance of personal relationships:
I guess a major theme for me would be, being the person you
want to be . . . every day like, I strive to be, I strive to do my best
um, whether that be academically or just the personal
relationships we make. (P8, AP)
Indeed, all but one of the participants described positivity in
their relationships as an overall theme that summarizes their
life story.4 Thus, the "relationship success" theme appears to
be most central to the narrative identities of adaptive perfec-
tionists in this sample.
In contrast, the stories of maladaptive perfectionists are
characterized by struggle, negative emotions, and agentic
striving. The life themes of the maladaptive perfectionists
thus tended to incorporate two major components: (a) a pre-
occupation with negative life events and (b) a tendency to
strive for self-improvement as a means to cope with those
events. That is, when making sense of the negative events in
their life, maladaptive perfectionists tended to focus on how
they could improve themselves, rather than reaching out to
others for help. Seven of 14 maladaptive perfectionists
described a life theme consistent with this pattern. For exam-
ple, one participant describes striving to improve despite her
perfectionism:
Even though I feel . . . like the world is crashing down around
me a lot, it hasn't, through everything, and that must say
something about, how dumb perfectionism is (laughs) to be
honest (laughs) I didn't know how to say that eloquently but
perfectionism it's dumb, and it has ruled my life for too long and
it still rules my life but I wanna change it. (P3, MP)
It is notable that many of these participants (six of 14) spe-
cifically described the negative role of perfectionism in
their life, many times striving to improve themselves with-
out outside assistance. In this story, the participant
describes a stressor (lack of parental support) and how she
improves her own self-knowledge without any help from
others:
I have doubts about myself all my life. What is happening is you
know, I don't really have a supporting environment as a child,
and I'm constantly being doubted and, I don't want to be the
best, I have to and then now I choose to be . . . but the thing was
no one helped me. So, self-discovery is really self-discovery
(laughs), I have do everything by myself.
Overall then, "agentic redemption" was considered the cen-
tral theme in the lives of half of our sample of maladaptive
perfectionists. However, it is worth noting that one partici-
pant described the unifying theme in her life as "fear of los-
ing control . . . not being able to control every aspect of my
life" (P19, MP), which is most consistent with the agentic
contamination theme.
However, there were some maladaptive perfectionists
(five of 14)5 who described communal themes as most cen-
tral to their lives, rather than agentic themes. Two partici-
pants described themes of "relationship success," much in
the same way as the adaptive perfectionists (e.g., "no matter
how bad it is, there is always someone who can stand with
you," P12, MP). The other three participants displayed
themes more consistent with the "relationship problems"
theme. Indeed, one participant concisely described the core
theme in his life as "loneliness or insecurity" (P5, MP).
Another described the perfectionistic standards of her par-
ents as having a negative effect on her life:
I think um, I kind of, I try to be, kind of perfect for my parents. .
. . So I think uh, I kind of let my parents decide a lot of things for
me, and kind of walk all over me and kind of push me to be, a
little too much, I-I couldn't handle everything. (P17, MP)
These three "relationship problems" stories are distinct from
the more positive communal themes that emerged for almost
all of the adaptive perfectionists. Nonetheless, though a
minority of maladaptive perfectionists described communal
themes as central to their life, most focused on themes of
"agentic redemption," which stands in contrast to the com-
munal "relationship success" stories told by adaptive
perfectionists.
Discussion
Perfectionism Interview Questions
We generated five themes from participant responses to our
perfectionism interview questions. The two most common
themes bore similarity to the APS-R Standards and
Discrepancy subscales, respectively. In the "high personal
standards and goals" theme, participants described perfec-
tionism as striving to be the best, flawless, and/or to meet and
maintain very high standards for their performance (particu-
larly work or school performance). In the "performance is
never good enough" theme, perfectionistic people were
defined by participants as people who thought their efforts
were inadequate and experienced strong negative reactions
10 SAGE Open
when failing to meet or maintain their high, and often unre-
alistic, standards. That these two themes emerge strongly is
perhaps not surprising, given that participants were prese-
lected to be high in Standards and/or Discrepancy and had all
completed the APS-R prior to completing the interview.
Thus, these two themes may be seen as triangulating qualita-
tive evidence to support the validity of these perfectionism
dimensions.
The remaining themes were less common and consistent
across participants. In the "being neat and organized" theme,
participants described perfectionists as having a preference
for orderly environments and meticulous care of personal
appearance. This theme mirrors item content not only of the
APS-R Order subscale but also of the Frost et al. (1990)
Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS) Organization
subscale. Even though most researchers at present would
consider orderliness to be a separate construct from perfec-
tionism (Stoeber & Otto, 2006), this feature of perfectionism
remains relatively common in lay descriptions of perfection-
ism. Moreover, the present study also found that meticulous
care of physical appearance was sometimes described as a
feature of perfectionism, which does not appear often in per-
fectionism questionnaires but does arise in the item content
of Hewitt et al.'s (2003) Self-Promotion subscale of perfec-
tionistic self-presentation.
The "feels superior to others" theme referred to instances
where perfectionism led to feelings of superiority and com-
petence (typically in response to praise) and criticism of oth-
ers' imperfections. This theme is perhaps closest to Hewitt
and Flett's (1991) Other-Oriented Perfectionism dimension,
or the more recently developed narcissistic perfectionism
latent factor (Nealis, Sherry, Sherry, Stewart, MacNeil, ,
2015). Finally, participants also described a feature of per-
fectionism as a tendency to "get caught up in the details,"
where participants tended to perseverate and focus on minute
details in tasks, often to the detriment of other areas in their
life. This perhaps most closely resembles Frost et al.'s (1990)
Doubts About Actions subscale, which is a facet of the
broader Perfectionistic Concerns dimension (Stoeber & Otto,
2006). Overall then, the qualitative responses were generally
representative of the perfectionism dimensions covered by a
wide array of perfectionism scales currently in use. However,
it is worth noting that some commonly discussed features of
perfectionism, such as parental criticism and expectations
(Frost et al., 1990), were generally absent from the way par-
ticipants defined perfectionism (although participants did
mention parental criticism occasionally in the life narrative
interviews).
In general, adaptive and maladaptive perfectionists tended
to give relatively similar responses to the perfectionism
questions when asked about their definition of perfectionism,
along with the best and worst things about being a perfec-
tionist. Most participants described the best thing about
being a perfectionist with responses that fell into the "high
personal standards and goals" theme and the worst parts as
falling into the "performance is never good enough" theme.
However, some small differences were noted. When partici-
pants were asked if they believed they were a perfectionist,
all but one maladaptive perfectionist agreed, whereas the
adaptive perfectionists were unsure. Similarly, when asked
whether they knew anyone else who was a perfectionist,
adaptive perfectionists tended to focus their responses on the
"high standards" and "being neat and orderly" themes, while
maladaptive perfectionists tended to focus on "performance
is never good enough," "being neat and orderly," and "feels
superior to others" themes. Thus, it seems that elevations in
both the Discrepancy and Standards subscales were impor-
tant for self-identifying as a perfectionist, and that the sub-
groups did slightly influence how other perfectionistic
people were defined (i.e., with perfectionism in others being
defined more closely to their own perfectionism subgroup
status).
Life Narratives
In the life narrative interviews, we identified five themes. In
the relationship success theme, we observed patterns of
appreciating and valuing others and successfully reaching
out to others for aid. This theme is similar to communion
subthemes of love/friendship and care/help described by
McAdams et al. (1996). In fact, every participant within the
study expressed valuing close, intimate relationships.
Although this might seem strange in light of research linking
perfectionism to social disconnection (Sherry, Mackinnon, &
Gautreau, 2016), the prominence of these themes likely rep-
resent a developmental trend toward valuing interpersonal
relationships in young adulthood (Mackinnon et al., 2011).
Although all participants demonstrated a strong appreciation
for close relationships, the manner in which they described
these events gave the impression that these bonding moments
were rare or surprising. Adaptive perfectionists tended to
describe relationship success as a central theme that cut
across their whole life. In contrast, few maladaptive perfec-
tionists described relationship success as a central, unifying
theme in their life story. Thus, the adaptive perfectionists
(but not the maladaptive perfectionists) framed their life
story as a developmental success: They were happy with
their relationships, and felt loved and supported.
Within the relationship problems theme, stories involved
conflict with others and relational contamination. Here, con-
sistent with the social disconnection model (Sherry et al.,
2016), we observed difficulties in the domain of communion.
Many participants expressed a difficulty controlling their
emotions and being confrontational. A number of partici-
pants described instances where a friend betrayed or
neglected them in some way, causing the participant to
become less trusting and more cautious around others--par-
ticipants frequently described such events as a personal mis-
take of being "too trusting." For instance, one participant
stated, "I think it says I was more naïve before, whereas now
Farmer et al. 11
I am a little bit more confrontational, a bit less trusting" (P1,
MP). The general prominence of this theme is in line with
prior theory that links perfectionism to heightened conflict
and social disconnection from others (Sherry et al., 2016).
However, only a few maladaptive perfectionists (and no
adaptive perfectionists) regarded relationship problems as
central in their life story. Thus, although social disconnection
may be the mechanism by which some perfectionists experi-
ence negative affect, these narrative themes were not univer-
sal. Nonetheless, maladaptive perfectionists can be partially
distinguished from adaptive perfectionists by the way they
narrate communion. That is, adaptive perfectionists interpret
their relationships as successful, whereas maladaptive per-
fectionists tend to highlight their loneliness and relationship
problems.
The agentic redemption theme included examples where
participants gained a more positive outlook on situations and
became more self-assured and confident in their abilities.
This self-assurance in one's abilities (i.e., agency) was also
identified and discussed by McAdams et al. (1996). It seems
intuitively reasonable that highly perfectionistic people
would choose to tell their life story in such a way that empha-
sizes agentic achievement, and is indeed consistent with a
prior mixed-methods research by Mackinnon et al. (2013)
using a similar life story interview. McAdams, Reynolds,
Lewis, Patten, and Bowman (2001) have long discussed the
adaptive qualities of the redemptive script, and originally
identified this pattern in the lives of healthy, highly genera-
tive people. In this sample, perfectionistic people make
agentic meaning out of their suffering; despite the negative
consequences in their life, their perfectionistic strivings are
also perceived as a strength, and participants' optimism
regarding future self-improvement is admirable. It is notable
that many maladaptive perfectionists (but no adaptive per-
fectionists) tended to use themes of agentic redemption as
the central unifying theme in their lives.Adaptive perfection-
ists recognized others as resources who successfully pro-
vided support through tough times. In contrast, maladaptive
perfectionists tended to withdraw from others and focus on
self-sufficiency and self-improvement in response to stress.
That is, adaptive perfectionists stressed the importance of
communion, while maladaptive perfectionists emphasized
agentic success. These approaches are analogous to Horney's
(1950) neurotic needs of moving toward others (adaptive
perfectionists) and moving away from others (maladaptive
perfectionists), and may suggest distinct interpersonal styles
in these two groups.
The agentic contamination theme included examples where
agentic accomplishments were ruined by the events that fol-
lowed it, leading to negative emotions. These increases in
negativity and regret directed toward oneself were also evi-
dent in some of the themes in the perfectionism questions, as
well as prior research on perfectionism (Egan et al., 2013;
Hewitt & Flett, 1991). Moreover, the theme bears resemblance
to McAdams et al.'s (2001) contamination scripts, which is a
common depressogenic narrative script (Adler, Kissel, &
McAdams, 2006). This theme further demonstrates the ten-
dencies of perfectionists to be extremely self-critical and to
experience negative emotions when they fail to reach their
high standards. However, agentic contamination themes were
not useful for differentiating between adaptive and maladap-
tive perfectionists. Indeed, both adaptive and maladaptive per-
fectionists described feelings of "not being good enough"
when faced with agentic failures. It is possible that these
themes are driven by APS-R Standards--a feature that both
types of perfectionists share. Perfectionistic students had a
decidedly internal attributional style--When they failed to
accomplish a goal, they blamed themselves rather than other
people or the situation. These stories also seemed consistent
with self-discrepancy theory (Higgins, 1987), wherein partici-
pants described a discrepancy between their ideal and actual
selves, which in turn led to depressed affect. For perfectionis-
tic people, moments where one falls short of one's own high
standards are inevitable. However, agentic contamination
themes were comparatively rare, and only one participant (a
maladaptive perfectionist) described such themes as central to
his or her life story. Nonetheless, such themes may be relevant
in a clinical sample of perfectionists who suffer from mental
health problems.
Our final theme was academic success. Within this theme,
participants discussed instances where they triumphed at
achieving an academic goal, with an emphasis on working
hard to achieve their goals. Many participants described
early childhood memories where parents would stress the
importance of academic excellence. This theme is consistent
with the long-held idea that parental perfectionistic standards
are an important risk factor for the development of perfec-
tionism in children (Frost, Lahart, & Rosenblate, 1991).
Most participants expressed sentiments of victory and tri-
umph, as though all their hard work was paying off by
achieving a goal. These moments of victory appeared to be
pivotal in increasing participants' determination to strive for
excellence. However, the academic success theme did not
differentiate between adaptive and maladaptive perfection-
ists in the present sample because no participant described
academic success as a central theme. Although academic
success was important for both adaptive and maladaptive
perfectionists, it did not seem central to their narrative
identity.
Limitations
This study had limitations. The sample was a small, young,
university student sample of perfectionists. Thus, the results
do not necessarily generalize to the population. Cutoff scores
on the APS-R used to define adaptive and maladaptive perfec-
tionists were normed on samples from the United States (Rice
&Ashby, 2007); however, evidence from our mass testing sur-
vey(see"SelectionCriteria"section)suggeststhatDiscrepancy
scores may be higher among Canadian students or at least at
12 SAGE Open
our institution specifically. Thus, using these cutoff scores
may have produced more classification errors in a Canadian
context, and some participants may have been misclassified.
Our qualitative analysis provided insight into the ways in
which perfectionists conceptualize perfectionism and how
they narrate their own lives. However, a drawback to using
qualitative analysis is that it is more difficult to determine
cause and effect relationships. Moreover, although attempts
were made to limit preknowledge of participants prior to the
interview, the first author was not fully blinded to which per-
fectionistic subgroup participants were in. This may have
introduced bias during the interview. Future researchers may
wish to use double-blind procedures to further minimize bias
in the interview process. Moreover, although thematic analysis
does provide a structured framework for interpreting qualita-
tive data, it is a comparatively basic qualitative technique.
Future researchers may wish to incorporate methods such as
grounded theory or discourse analysis. Also, future research
might consider incorporating a nonperfectionistic "control"
group to provide a comparison between how nonperfectionis-
tic and perfectionistic individuals differ in how they interpret
and narrate events in their lives. Such a control group might
help differentiate features central to perfectionism from other
features of identity (e.g., student status, age).
Conclusion
Clinicians often conduct therapy by talking to the client,
attempting to glean information as to potential underlying
disorders and belief systems through dialogue. By analyzing
and identifying how perfectionists conceptualize perfection-
ism, and how they tend to describe and focus on specific life
events, our results may help to identify perfectionists within
clinical practice. Moreover, it may help clinicians develop a
better understanding of perfectionistic clients. By examining
the narrative life story of participants, the current study
sought to develop a better understanding of the "whole per-
fectionist." Perfectionistic university students saw perfec-
tionism as a double-edged sword, with both positive and
negative aspects in the lives of themselves and others.
Qualitative analyses also revealed great focus on interper-
sonal relationships and academic achievement. There were
highs and lows, and participants were complex and idiosyn-
cratic. Nonetheless, themes of perfectionism pervaded the
narratives, and the themes presented here may prove useful
and informative for clinicians seeking to identify perfection-
ism from autobiographical narratives.

1. There was a 10th story that was not analyzed in this article.
The "drinking story" was a story where the consumption of
alcohol plays a major role. Data from this story will be pre-
sented separately in a second article focusing on alcohol use
and perfectionism (Nealis & Mackinnon, submitted).

3. Notably, all but one maladaptive perfectionist agreed that they
were a perfectionist in the interviews. In contrast, adaptive
perfectionists tended to be more ambivalent, with two partici-
pants saying they definitely were not, three who were unsure,
and one who agreed. The one maladaptive participant who
disagreed (P21) had the lowest discrepancy scores in the mal-
adaptive group (42.75). This seems to suggest high scores on
both standards and discrepancies are central to self-identifying
as a perfectionist.
4. The one participant who did not mention relationship success
still remained positive overall, noting,
I think I have a balance of good and bad in my life. I never
felt like I have a horrible life, and I never felt like I have the
most amazing life either, I just think it's very neutral and very
normal. And, I guess I'm okay with that. (P22, AP)
5. The one remaining maladaptive perfectionist who did mention
agentic or communal concerns focused on change, ". . . nothing
has been very constant or concrete it's always been in fluctuating
so I think change is one of the main themes in my life" (P9, MP).
