ABSTRACT
MS(multiplesclerosis)isthemostprevalentautoimmunedis-
ease of the CNS (central nervous system) historically charac-
terized as an inflammatory and demyelinating disease. More
recently, extensive neuronal pathology has lead to its clas-
sification as a neurodegenerative disease as well. While the
immune system initiates the autoimmune response it re-
mains unclear how it orchestrates neuronal damage. In our
previous studies, using in vitro cultured embryonic neurons,
we demonstrated that MBP (myelin basic protein)-specific
encephalitogenic CD4 T-cells induce early neuronal damage.
In an extension of those studies, here we show that po-
larized CD4 Th1 and Th17 cells as wells as CD8 T-cells and
NK (natural killer) cells induce microtubule destabilization
within neurites in a contact-independent manner. Owing to
the cytotoxic potential of these immune cells, we isolated
the luminal components of lytic granules and determined
that they were sufficient to drive microtubule destabilization.
Since lytic granules contain cytolytic proteins, we determined
that the induction of microtubule destabilization occurred
prior to signs of apoptosis. Furthermore, we determined that
microtubule destabilization was largely restricted to axons,
sparing dendrites. This study demonstrated that lymphocytes
with cytolytic activity have the capacity to directly drive MAD
(microtubule axonal destabilization) in a bystander manner
that is independent of neuronal death.

INTRODUCTION
MS (multiple sclerosis) affects an estimated 400000 people
in the US and 2.5 million worldwide (Sospedra and Martin,
2005). Although MS is considered a demyelinating disease,
it is now well recognized that neuronal damage and loss
is a major component of the disease (Nylander and Hafler,
2012). The prevailing view is that CD4 T-cells of the Th1
and/or Th17 phenotype with specificity to myelin antigens
drive lesion formation in the CNS (central nervous system),
resulting in immune cell infiltration, demyelination and neu-
ronal damage/loss leading to a variety of neurological deficits
(Edwards et al., 2010; Hedegaard et al., 2008; Herz et al.,
2009; Kebir et al., 2007; Kornek et al., 2000; Lovett-Racke
et al., 2011; Montes et al., 2009; Nylander and Hafler, 2012;
Tzartos et al., 2008).
In newly diagnosed MS patients, brain biopsies exhib-
ited evidence of axonal injury in demyelinated plaques and
normal appearing white matter, suggesting that neurode-
generation occurs simultaneously with the establishment of
lesions by immune cells (Bjartmar et al., 2003; Ferguson et al.,
1997; Kuhlmann et al., 2002). In primary progressive MS,
asnneuro.org / Volume 5 (1) / art:e00105 13
N. M. Miller and others
accumulating neuronal damage/loss is thought to be the ma-
jor contributor to the decline in health status of the patients
(Bjartmar et al., 2003; Sepulcre et al., 2006; Tallantyre et al.,
2009). While the correlation between the presence of immune
cell infiltrates in the CNS and neuronal damage is strong, the
exact mechanisms whereby the immune system induces such
damage are unknown. Potential immune-mediated mecha-
nisms include direct cytotoxicity or indirect mechanisms such
as glutamate excitotoxicity, vulnerability due to demyelina-
tion or oxidative stress (Lassmann, 2010; Miller, 2012; Nikic
et al., 2011; Siffrin et al., 2010b).
Relapsing and remitting MS is not consistent with wide-
spread neuronal loss, but rather reversible neuronal damage.
To this end, using the animal model of MS, EAE (experimen-
tal autoimmune encephalomyelitis), we previously demon-
strated that neuronal damage evident in areas of immune cell
infiltration was reversed when the mice underwent sponta-
neous recovery (Shriver and Dittel, 2006). Interestingly, this
neuronal damage occurred prior to overt demyelination. Fur-
ther support of this concept is evidence of immune-mediated
neuronal damage in the absence of co-localized demyelinat-
ing processes in MS (Aboul-Enein et al., 2006; Bitsch et al.,
2000; DeLuca et al., 2006). Thus, even though oligodendro-
cytes have recently been shown to provide metabolic support
for neurons (Funfschilling et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012), their
loss is not the sole predictor of vulnerability to neuronal
injury in MS.
Previously, we reported that encephalitogenic CD4 T-cells
induced neuronal damage (Shriver and Dittel, 2006). Here,
we extended these findings and demonstrate that CD4 Th1,
CD4 Th17, CD8 as well as NK (natural killer) cells induce neu-
ronal damage via the induction of MAD (microtubule axonal
destabilization). Furthermore, we provide evidence that neu-
ronal damage is mediated by a protein expressed within the
luminal contents of lytic granules expressed by immune cells
with cytolytic activity. We also found that MAD occurred
rapidly after exposure to lytic granules and prior to signs of
neuronal cell death. In addition, the restriction of MAD to
the axon indicates that immune cells have the potential
to contribute to axonopathies in diseases with a strong im-
mune cell component such as autoimmunity and infectious
disease.

B10.PL mice were bred with FVB mice and (Thy1-YFPxFVB)F1
embryos were collected on day 15 as described (Shriver and
Dittel, 2006). MBP­TCR (myelin basic protein­T-cell recep-
tor) transgenic mice specific for the acetylated NH2
-terminal
peptide MBP (Ac1­11) have been previously described (Dittel
et al., 1999). Animals were housed in the Translation Biomed-
ical Research Center of the Medical College of Wisconsin,
Milwaukee, WI. All animal protocols were approved by the
Medical College of Wisconsin's Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee.
Peptides, antibodies, cytokines and YT NK cell
line
The MBP Ac1-11 (Ac- ASQKRPSQRSK) and the OVA (oval-
bumin) peptide (SIINFEKL) were generated by the Protein
Chemistry Core of the Blood Research Institute (BloodCen-
ter of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI). The CA (conalbumin)134­
146 peptide (HRGAIEWEGIESG) was generated by the W.M.
Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale
University (Dittel et al., 1997). A monoclonal antibody to
3
-tubulin (IgG3
) antibody was generated locally by im-
munization with the ESESQGPK peptide coupled to KLH
[keyhole-limpet (Diodora aspera) haemocyanin] (IgG3
) and
purified with HiTrap Protein G HP columns (GE Healthcare).
Mouse anti-ankyrin G (IgG1

-tubulin was purchased from Millipore. Anti-IFN (inter-
feron ) clone XMG1.2 was purchased from eBioscience and
anti-IL-4 (interleukin 4) clone 11B1 was generated locally.
TGF (transforming growth factor ), IL-6, IL-23 and IL-1
were purchased from R&D Systems. Mouse IL-2 was either
generated locally or human recombinant IL-2 was a gift from
Dr. J. Verbsky (Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI).
YT cells, a human `NK cell-like' cell line, were obtained from
Dr. Carol Clayberger (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda,
MD) (Yodoi et al., 1985).
NK cell cultures
Splenocytes were isolated from C57BL/6J, Beige, granzyme
AB- / - or perforin- / - mice and passed over prehydrated
nylon fibre (ZeptoMetrix Corporation) columns and incu-
bated for 1 h at 37C to eliminate B cells and macrophages.
Cells were eluted from the column with RPMI 1640 and 5%
(v/v) FBS (foetal bovine serum) and pelleted by centrifuga-
tion. The cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 and 10% (v/v)
FBS supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10000 interna-
tional units penicillin and 10000 mg/ml streptomycin, 1 M
Hepes, BME (2-mercaptoethanol) and 1000 units/ml IL-2 and
cultured for 4 days at 37C, 5% (v/v) CO2
(Regunathan et al.,
2005). After 4 days, non-adherent cells were transferred to
a new flask and the adherent (NK cells) and non-adherent

Cytolytic lymphocytes induce axonal damage
cells were provided fresh RPMI 1640 and 10% (v/v) FBS with
1000 units/ml of IL-2 and cultured for an additional 2­3 days.
Adherent and floating cells were combined for subsequent
procedures.
Generation of Th1 and Th17 MBP-specific T cell
lines and the Th2 D10 clone
To generate Th1 and Th17 CD4 T-cell lines, total splenocytes
from MBP-TCR transgenic mice (H-2u) specific for the MBP
Ac1-11 peptide in the context of I­Au were cultured with
5 g/ml of the peptide in Th1 and Th17 skewing conditions
(Dittel et al., 1999). For Th1 skewing the splenocytes were cul-
tured with 8 g/ml IL-12 and 5 ng/ml anti-IL-4 and for Th17
skewing with 5 ng/ml TGF, 10 ng/ml IL-6, 0.1 ng/ml IL-23,
1 ng/ml IL-1, 5 ng/ml anti-IL-4 (clone 11B11) and 125 ng/ml
anti-IFN. The cultures were maintained by the addition of
fresh medium along with skewing antibodies and cytokines
on day 3. The T-cell lines were restimulated on day 7 with Ac1-
11 and irradiated splenocytes as APC (antigen-presenting
cells) and provided with fresh medium on day 10, which for
the Th17 cultures contained skewing cytokines and antibod-
ies. For Th2 cells, the D10 clone specific for the CA137­146
peptide in the context of I-Ak was cultured with irradiated
B10.BR (H-2k) splenocytes with 5 g/ml CA137­146 as de-
scribed (Dittel et al., 1997). D10 cultures were restimulated
on days 11 and 22 with irradiated B10.BR splenocytes and
5 g/ml of CA137­146 peptide and allowed to expand for
10 days. Intracellular expression of IFN, IL-17 and IL-4 was
detected as described (Ray et al., 2012).
OT-1 (CD8) cell lines
CD8+ splenic T-cells were isolated from OT-1 TCR transgenic
mice specific for OVA peptide in the context of H-2Kb by posi-
tive selection using anti-CD8-biotin (eBioscience), anti-biotin
microbeads and MACS separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec).
Purified CD8+ cells (3×106) were cultured in the presence
of OVA peptide (1 g/ml) and irradiated T-cell-depleted syn-
geneic splenocytes (12×106) for 5 days.
Preparation of cell supernatants and lysates
For isolation of supernatants, 6­10×106 cultured NK cells
were treated with 20 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml ionomycin
for 4­6 h after which the supernatants were collected, fil-
tered (0.2 m) and frozen at - 20C. For cell lysates, NK or T-
cells were activated with 20 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml iono-
mycin for 4­6 h after which the cell pellet was resuspended in
neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mM L-
glutamine, 100 g/ml of gentamicin, 0.05 g/ml fungizone,
6 mg/ml glucose and 1.5 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate at 1×106
cells/ml and incubated at 37C, 5% (v/v) CO2
overnight. The
cell-culture suspensions were collected, frozen at - 80C for
15 min and then thawed at 37C. The ruptured cells were pel-
leted by centrifugation and the supernatants were filtered,
aliquoted and frozen at - 20C.
Isolation of lytic granules
Lytic granules were isolated using an adapted protocol (Bor-
regaard et al., 1983; Thiery et al., 2010). Briefly, mouse NK
(150­300×106) or YT (0.09­1.5×109) cells were harvested
by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS and resus-
pended in 5 ml of relaxation buffer (1×) containing 10 mM
KCl, 3.5 mM MgCl2
, 10 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 1.25 mM EGTA and
1 mM ATP. Plasma membranes were disrupted by N2
cav-
itation at 450 psi (1 psi = 6.9 kPa) on ice and the nuclei
and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 4C
for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and the pellet was
washed once with 4 ml relaxation buffer (1×) and pooled
with the first washed supernatant. The disrupted cell super-
natant was overlayed onto a discontinuous percoll gradient
with a density of 1.120, 1.090 and 1.050 g/ml and centrifuged
at 37000 g for 30 min at 4C with a Beckman JA 20 ro-
tor (Masson and Tschopp, 1985). Then 3 ml fractions were
collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient and
centrifuged at 110000 g at 4C for 3 h with a TLA 100.3
Beckman Coulter rotor, causing the subcellular organelles to
form a white cotton-like consistency lying above a hard-
packed percoll pellet (Podack and Konigsberg, 1984). For the
disruption of the granular membranes, the supernatant was
collected and a final concentration of 2 M NaCl was added
that was then subjected to four freeze/thaw cycles and cen-
trifuged at 110000 g at 4C for 1 h with a TLA 100.3 ro-
tor. The supernatant was collected and dialysed against one
change of PBS overnight at 4C. The protein concentration
of the final suspension was measured by an ND 1000 spec-
trophotometer and frozen at - 20C.
Embryonic neuronal cultures
Embryonic neurons were cultured using an adapted protocol
from Ransom et al. (Ransom et al., 1977; Shriver and Dittel,
2006). For Figure 1, brains and spinal cords were isolated
on embryonic day 15 and triturated in DISGH buffer con-
taining 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.3 mM Na2
HPO4
, 0.2 mM
KH2
PO4
, 16.5 mM glucose, 22 mM sucrose and 9.86 mM
Hepes followed by digestion in 0.67 mg/ml papain at 37C
for 30 min. The tissue was titrated in 40 g/ml DNase di-
luted in MEM (minimal essential medium) and were pelleted
by centrifugation and resuspended in MEM containing 10%
(v/v) horse serum and 10% (v/v) FBS. Neurons were plated
on polyethylenimine coated plates and after 8 h the medium
was replaced with neurobasal medium containing N2
supple-
ment (Invitrogen), 2 mM glutamine, 100 g/ml gentamicin
and 0.05 g/ml fungizone. Three days later, the cultures were
treated with 0.054 mM fluorodeoxyuridine (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 0.014 mM uridine (Sigma-Aldrich) to inhibit prolifera-
tion of astrocytes. Fresh medium was added to the culture
every 2 days and cultures were used approximately 10 days
after seeding. For Figures 2­7, brains and spinal cords on

Figure 1 Encephalitogenic T-cell-driven destabilization of the neuronal network does not require cell contact
Embryonic neurons were cultured from (Thy1-YFPxFVB)F1 mice and were treated with medium alone (A), conditioned medium collected
from encephalitogenic CD4 T-cell cultures (B) or 10×106 MBP-specific encephalitogenic CD4 T-cells added to the top well of a transwell

embryonic day 15 were dissected out and dissociated with
0.67 mg/ml papain (Fisher) in HBSS (Hanks balanced salt solu-
tion) (Mediatech) supplemented with glucose (6 mg/ml) and
sodium bicarbonate (1.5 mg/ml) at 37C. The tissue was then
mechanically tritruated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette
and 40 g/ml of DNaseI (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in MEM (Me-
diatech). The non-dissociated tissue was allowed to settle out
and the clear cell suspension was collected and pelleted by
centrifugation. The neuronal cells were resuspended in MEM
supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 10% (v/v) horse serum,
sodium bicarbonate and glucose. The neuronal cells were
seeded on German glass coverslips pretreated with poly-D-
lysine (20 g/ml) and laminin (10 g/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) at
0.1­0.2×106/ml and incubated at 37C, 10% (v/v) CO2
. Af-
ter 4 h, the medium was removed and replaced with neu-
robasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B-27
(Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 g/ml gentamicin sul-
phate, 0.05 g/ml fungizone, 6 mg/ml glucose and 1.5 mg/ml
sodium bicarbonate. After 3 days, neurons were treated with
1­5 M Ara-C (Cytosine B-D-arabinofuranoside) (Sigma-
Aldrich) to inhibit proliferation of glial cells. Neuronal cul-
tures were maintained with the addition of fresh neurobasal
medium every 3­4 days. Neuronal cultures on days 10­12
were used for experimentation. Human embryonic neuronal
cultures were generated as described (Jana and Pahan, 2004,
2010). The experimental protocols were reviewed and ap-
proved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Rush Univer-
sity Medical Center. Briefly, foetal brains (11-17 week) were
obtained from the Human Embryology Laboratory (Univer-
sity of Washington, Seattle, WA). The tissue was triturated
and then trypsinized (0.25%) for 15 min at 37C followed by
inactivation. The dissociated tissue was then filtered through
380 and 140 m meshes (Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged.
The cellular pellet was washed once with PBS followed by
a wash in neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27
with antibiotics. Following adhesion to poly-D-lysine-coated
plates for 5 min the non-adherent cells were removed and
the remaining cells were treated with 10 m Ara-C and were
cultured for 10 days. Purity of the neurons (98%) was deter-
mined by MAP2 staining.
Immunocytochemistry
Embryonic neurons were treated with 0.5 ml activated NK,
Beige, CD8, Th1, Th2, Th17, granzyme A/B- / - or perforin- / -
cell supernatants or lysates or 75­300 g/ml Beige or YT lytic
granules for 1­2 h at 37C, 10% (v/v) CO2
. The cells were then
washed with PBS and fixed and permeabilized with 4% (v/v)
PFA (paraformaldehyde) and ice-cold methanol. The fixed
cells were washed with 0.1% (v/v) Tween in PBS for five
cycles at 5 min per cycle at room temperature prior to 1 h
of blocking with 3% (w/v) BSA in 0.1% (v/v) Tween. Sub-
sequently, cells were incubated with combinations of pri-
mary antibodies: anti-mouse 3
-tubulin (IgG3
), anti-chicken
polyclonal MAP2 (IgY) and/or anti-mouse anykrin G (IgG1
)
overnight at 4C. The secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse
IgG3 Alexa fluor 488, goat anti-mouse IgG1
Alexa fluor 546
and goat anti-chicken IgG (H + L) Alexa fluor 633 were ap-
plied to neuronal cells and incubated for 1 h at room temper-
ature. Neuronal coverslips were mounted in aqueous mount-
ing media (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Controls consisting
of the secondary antibodies alone exhibited minimal back-
ground staining (results not shown). In addition, all possible
primary and secondary antibody combinations were exam-
ined to confirm specificity of the desired staining (results not
shown).
Transwell and live cell imaging
Transwells with a 0.4 m filter (Corning Inc) were placed
above Thy1-YFP neuronal cultures on day 10 and 10×106
activated CD4+ T-cells or conditioned medium from T-cells
were collected and added to the top well. After 4 h, the
transwells were removed and the neurons were imaged using
a Nikon inverted microscope and MetaMorph software.

cultures were treated with 150­300 g/ml Beige or YT lytic
granules for 1 h at 37C, 10% (v/v) CO2
. Neuronal cells were
washed with PBS, fixed with 4% (v/v) PFA and permeabilized
with 0.2% (v/v) Trition X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) or ice-cold
methanol. Neuronal cells were either stained with TUNEL
and DAPI (4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for quantification
purposes or with 3
-tubulin and TUNEL for qualitative pur-
poses. Positive control samples for TUNEL were treated with
10 units/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature
and the negative control sample was incubated without the
recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme.
Confocal microscopy and imaging
Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed using the
Olympus Fluoview FV1000 MPE Multiphoton Laser Scanning
Microscope. The objective used was a ×40, 1.30 oil N.A. For
triple labelling experiments sequential scanning was selected
to allow for separation of signals from each channel. Flu-
oview FV10-ASW v3.1c software (Olympus) was used for the
application of images.
RESULTS
Encephalitogenic T-cell driven destabilization of
the neuronal microtubule network does not
require cell contact
We previously showed that when embryonic neurons from
Thy1-YFP mice were cocultured with MBP-specific encephal-
itogenic CD4 T capable of inducing EAE (Dittel et al., 1999)
YFP fluorescence was redistributed from a continuous pattern
in the cell body and neuritic processes (Figure 1A) to that of
aggregated domains contained within the neurites (Shriver
and Dittel, 2006). We next asked whether cell­cell contact
was required and found that it was not since the continu-
ous YFP fluorescence in unmanipulated embryonic neurons
(Figure 1A) was disrupted by both supernatants from en-
cephalitogenic T-cell cultures (Figure 1B) and their presence
in the top of chamber of a transwell (Figure 1C).
Microtubule destabilization is mediated by CD4
Th1, CD4 Th17, CD8 and NK cells, but not CD4
Th2 cells
Since EAE is induced by CD4 T-cells of the Th1 and Th17 sub-
types (El-behi et al., 2010), we next asked whether one or both
would drive microtubule destabilization. In our previous stud-
ies, we determined that alterations in YFP fluorescence was
associated with destabilization of the microtubule network
as visualized by staining with anti-3
-tubulin (Shriver and
Dittel, 2006). Because the detection of microtubule desta-
bilization by immunofluorescence proved more robust than
alterations in YFP fluorescence, all subsequent studies were
performed using the former method. When we stained unma-
nipulated neuronal cultures with anti-3
-tubulin, we found
that the microtubule network was uniformly expressed in all
neuritis, which we used as a general indicator of the health
of the cultures (Figure 2A). Owing to differences in granu-
lar composition and secretion profiles of lymphocyte subsets,
we choose to use cellular lysates instead of supernatants to
normalize the potential of each cell type to drive micro-
tubule destabilization. Using MBP­TCR transgenic mice, we
generated Th1 (Figure 3A) and Th17 (Figure 3B) cell lines and
confirmed their differentiated phenotype by intracellular cy-
tokine staining. We found that both Th1 (Figure 3B) and Th17
(Figure 3C) CD4 T-cells drove microtubule destabilization re-
sulting in a 3-tubulin punctate `beads-on-a-string' staining
pattern in a subset of neuritis. Next, we reasoned that, due to

their inability to induce EAE, CD4 Th2 cells would not drive
microtubule destabilization (Khoruts et al., 1995). Using the
well-characterized D10 Th2 clone (Dittel et al., 1997) (Fig-
ure 2C), we confirmed that it lacked the ability to drive micro-
tubule destabilization (Figure 3D). We then examined other
immune cell types and found that CD8 (Figure 3E) and NK
cells (Figure 3F), but not splenocytes, B cells, macrophages nor
microglial cells, were able to induce neuronal damage (results
not shown). The use of cell lysates in this study also demon-
strated that intracellular proteins such as calpains, lysosomal
enzymes and cell-signalling molecules that are common to
all T-cells do not play a role in microtubule destabilization.
Microtubule destabilization is driven by a
component of lytic granules
One common feature of CD4 Th1, CD8 and NK cells is their
cytotoxic potential via the secretion of lytic granules follow-
ing activation. To determine whether the ability to induce
microtubule destabilization was due to a component of lytic
granules, we used several approaches. First, we treated en-
cephaltiogenic CD4 T-cells with nocodazole to disrupt the
polymerization of microtubules required for the release of
lytic granules and found that the treated supernatants failed
to mediate neuronal damage (results not shown). Secondly,
we generated NK cell cultures from Beige mice, which har-
bour a frame-shift mutation in the Lyst gene leading to
defects in vesicle trafficking resulting in defective cytolytic
functions (Barbosa et al., 1996; Kaplan et al., 2008; Roder
et al., 1979). When we compared the staining pattern of
3
-tubulin in control neurons (Figure 4A), we found that
supernatants from Beige NK cells (Figure 4B) did not alter
microtubule stability. In contrast, cellular lysates from the
same NK cells did exhibit the activity (Figure 4C). We then
isolated the luminal contents of lytic granules from CD4 Th1
(Figure 4D), CD4 Th17 (Figure 4E), NK cells (Figure 4F) and
CD8 T-cells (results not shown) and found that they drove
microtubule destabilization. These data demonstrate that T-
cells with cytotoxic potential and NK cells are similar in their
ability to drive microtubule destabilization. In addition, the
component of lytic granules that drives microtubule desta-
bilization is probably a protein because the methods used
to isolate the luminal components of lytic granules enriches
for proteins and eliminates small molecules such a peptides,
nucleotides or amino acids.
The ability to mediate microtubule
destabilization is conserved among species
To determine the applicability of our current findings to hu-
mans, we asked whether human NK cells were able to induce
microtubule destabilization. Using mouse neuronal cultures
(Figure 5A), we found that cell lysates generated from human
peripheral blood NK cells were able to induce microtubule
destabilization (Figure 5B). Likewise, lytic granules from the
human YT `NK-like' cell line (Figure 5C) were also able to
induce microtubule destabilization. In addition, splenic rat
NK cell lytic granules exhibited similar activity (results not
shown). Furthermore, we found that human embryonic neu-
rons (Figure 5D) were susceptible to neuronal damage when
treated with mouse NK cell lytic granules (Figure 5E). These
data indicate that microtubule neuronal damage is conserved
across species and that studies in mice are directly applicable
to humans.

Cytolytic lymphocytes induce axonal damage
Figure 4 Microtubule destabilization is induced by the luminal contents of lytic granules
Embryonic neuronal cultures were generated as for Figure 2 (A­F). Neuronal cultures were treated with medium alone (A) or with cell
supernatants (B) or with cell lysates from activated NK cells from Beige mice diluted 1:2 in neurobasal media with supplements for
2 h (C). Lytic granules were isolated from in vitro skewed CD4 Th1 (33.5×106) (D) or Th17 cells (33.5×106) (E) or from mouse NK cells
(150­300×106) (F) and diluted 1:2 in neurobasal media with supplements and added to neuronal cultures for 1 h. Neurons were then
fixed and stained for 3
-tubulin and imaged by confocal microscopy. Arrows indicate neurites exhibiting microtubule destabilization.
Scale bar: 30 m.
Microtubule destabilization is independent of
neuronal apoptosis
Previously, it has been shown that cytotoxic lymphocytes as
well as NK cells can induce death of neurons (Backstrom et al.,
2003; Giuliani et al., 2003; Suvas et al., 2006). In our previous
study, we demonstrated that membrane integrity remained
intact in neurons co-cultured with CD4+ encephalitogenic
T-cells, indicating that the viability of the neurons was not
compromised (Shriver and Dittel, 2006). Because the treated
neurons could have been undergoing stages of apoptosis
prior to loss of membrane integrity, we next examined that
possibility using TUNEL to measure DNA fragmentation, a
hallmark of apoptosis. We found that about 25% of mouse
embryonic neurons in the medium alone were undergoing
apoptosis as determined by computing the percent TUNEL +
cells among the DAPI+ nuclei (Figures 6A and 6G). DNase
I treatment was used as a positive control for DNA frag-
mentation and was about 100% (Figures 6B and 6G). The
addition of lytic granules from YT cells had no effect on
basal levels of apoptosis (Figures 6C and 6G). To confirm that
microtubule destabilization is independent of apoptosis, we
stained for both TUNEL and 3
-tubulin. Control neurons ex-
hibited a continuous 3
-tubulin staining pattern and did not
exhibit signs of apoptosis (Figure 6D). DNase I treated neurons
were positive for TUNEL staining, but did not exhibit micro-
tubule destabilization (Figure 6E). In contrast, treatment with
YT lytic granules resulted in microtubule destabilization but
not apoptosis (TUNEL-) (Figure 6F).
The lack of apoptosis induction in our model of neuronal
damage is important since the lytic granule components per-
forin and granzyme A/B have been implicated in neuronal
death by apoptosis (Gobel et al., 2010; Haile et al., 2011). To
confirm that these cell death-inducing proteins are not me-
diating microtubule destabilization, we compared 3
-tubulin
staining in control neurons (Figure 7A) with neurons exposed
to NK cell lysates from granzyme A/B double (Figure 7B)
or perforin (Figure 7C) knockout mice and found that both
knockouts retained activity. These data indicate that the early
microtubule destabilization that we observe is mediated by a
mechanism independent of neuronal death.
Axons, but not dendrites, are susceptible to MAD
As evident in Figures 3­6, microtubule destabilization only
occurs in a subset of neurites, suggesting that dendrites and
axons are differentially affected. To investigate this question,
we stained neurons that had been exposed to lytic granules
with anti-3
-tubulin (green) to stain microtubules in both
axons and dendrites in combination with anti-MAP2 (blue)
to mark dendrites and anti-ankyrin G (red) to mark axons
(Figure 8) (Boiko et al., 2007; Kaech and Banker, 2006; Kanai
and Hirokawa, 1995; Kordeli et al., 1995; Kosik and Finch,
1987). We found that microtubule destabilization was largely
localized to axons (asterisk). The ankyrin G+ axon also still
expressed MAP2 within the axonal initial segment, which is
consistent with early stages of axonogenesis (Boiko et al.,

2007; Kosik and Finch, 1987). These cumulative data indicate
that MAD is a unique mechanism whereby cells of the im-
mune system with cytotoxic potential have the capacity to
induce axonopathies.
Figure 9 depicts our model of MAD. We propose that
myelin-specific CD4 T-cells enter the CNS, and at or near
the BBB (blood­brain barrier) become activated via interac-
tion with APC via MHC II: self-peptide, resulting in their cell
proliferation, cytokine production and the release of lytic
granular contents. The inflammation driven by the CD4 T-
cells would lead to a breakdown of the BBB allowing other
immune cells including CD8 T and NK cells to enter the CNS.
CD8 T-cells interacting with either APC, oligodendrocytes or
neurons via MHC I: self-peptide interactions would become
activated and release lytic granular contents. NK cells, which
do not require a specific antigen have the potential to inter-
act with any cell type within the CNS and would also release
lytic granular contents upon activation. Most likely via a by-
stander mechanism, some soluble protein component of the
lytic granules would induce a signalling cascade in neurons,
ultimately resulting in the destabilization of microtubules in
axons.
DISCUSSION
Neuronal damage is a prominent feature in MS and has been
well documented in EAE (Kornek et al., 2000; Nylander and
Hafler, 2012). In this study, we first investigated the immune
cell types that could contribute to neuronal damage and
found that both CD4 Th1 and Th17 cells (Figure 3), thought
to be the drivers of MS and EAE, induced MAD. Furthermore,
we found that CD8 and NK cells also induced microtubule
destabilization. Using a variety of strategies, we next found
that MAD activity resided within the lumen of lytic granules
and did not require direct cell contact between the immune
cells and neurons. Although lytic granules contain cytolytic
proteins, we found that microtubule destabilization occurred
early in the absence of evidence of cell death. Finally, since
axonal injury is thought to play a key role in the progression
of MS, we determined that microtubule destabilization was
restricted to axons, largely sparing the dendrites. Together,
these data provide strong evidence that the immune system
has the potential to directly cause neuronal damage result-
ing in axonopathy in both autoimmunity and in infectious
disease.
Using the EAE model, it is well established that both CD4
Th1 and Th17 cells contribute to disease. Although the exact
mechanisms whereby CD4 T-cells drive CNS autoimmunity
are not well understood, both cell types produce GM-CSF
(granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor), a key
cytokine required for the initiation of disease (El-Behi et al.
2011; McQualter et al., 2001; Ponomarev et al., 2007). They
both also produce chemokines, which draw other inflam-
matory cells into the CNS. In addition, IL-17 is a potent
inducer of chemokine production and has been shown to
induce chemokine production by astrocytes (Awane et al.,
1999; Kang et al., 2010; Meares et al., 2012). Here, we now
provide evidence that both CD4 Th1 and Th17 cells also di-
rectly drive neuronal damage (Figure 3). Consistent with our

observations, a recent study used intravital two-photon
imaging to demonstrate that CD4 Th17 cells induced neu-
ronal signalling in the brain stem of mice with EAE (Siffrin
et al., 2010a). However, this study did not determine the na-
ture of the T-cell:neuronal interactions and thus it is not
known if direct cell­cell contact was required. Since neurons
do not express MHC II, it is highly unlikely that cognate anti-
gen was required in this study. Our data demonstrate that,
at least for MAD, the direct interactions between T-cells and
neurons are not required (Figure 1).
Although CD8 T-cells are highly prevalent in MS lesions
(Babbe et al., 2000; Traugott et al., 1983), their role remains
controversial. In mouse EAE, the studies demonstrating both
protection and pathogenesis have been documented using
a variety of different models (Huseby et al., 2001; Ji and
Goverman, 2007; York et al., 2010). In terms of protection,
CD8 T-cells are thought to kill autoreactive CD4 T-cells (Hu
et al., 2004). In pathogenesis, it is possible that CD8 T-cells
kill CNS resident cells via cytotoxic mechanisms that include
Fas/FasL, TRAIL (tumour-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis-
inducing ligand) and granzyme/perforin (Aktas et al., 2005;
Giuliani et al., 2003; Haile et al., 2011; Medana et al., 2000;
Murray et al., 1998; Shrestha and Diamond, 2007; Vogt et al.,
2009). In addition, CD8 T-cells have been shown to tran-
sect neurites in vitro (Medana et al., 2001). Also, in vitro,
CD8 cytolytic mechanisms requiring cognate antigen were
recently demonstrated in virally infected cortical neurons
(Chevalier et al., 2011). However, a similar mechanism has

never been definitively demonstrated for self-antigens such
as in MS/EAE. Of interest to our observations is a recent study,
which demonstrated that collateral neuronal apoptosis fol-
lowing the antigen-specific attack by OT-1 CD8 T-cells of
OVA expressing oligodendrocytes in coronal brain slices was
probably due to spillover of perforin and granzymes from
the T-cell itself (Gobel et al., 2010). These data provide addi-
tional evidence that T-cell:neuronal contacts are not required
for the induction of neuronal damage by proteins contained
within the lytic granule.
NK cells also kill via lytic granules and have been shown
to be present in MS lesions (Kaur et al., 2012). While their
presence within the CNS may suggest a pathogenic role, in
EAE most studies point towards a protective role for NK
cells (Kaur et al., 2012). The antibody-mediated depletion
of NK cells prior to the induction of EAE led to increased
disease severity (Hao et al., 2010; Matsumoto et al., 1998;
Zhang et al., 1997), whereas NK cell activation had the op-
posite effect of greatly reducing disease (Jahng et al., 2001;
Singh et al., 2001). Potential protective mechanisms include
direct lysis of pathogenic CD4 T-cells or antigen present-
ing dendritic cells and neuroprotection by the production
of neurotrophic factors (Al-Falahi et al., 2009; Hammarberg
et al., 2000; Kaur et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2007; Zhang et al.,
1997). Consistent with a protective role, the trend is for
Figure 9 Model of MAD
Myelin-specific Th1 and/or Th17 cells drive inflammation within the CNS that results in the breakdown of the BBB and the release of
their lytic granular contents. In addition, CD8 T and NK cells enter the CNS and if they become activated also release the contents of their
lytic granules. The destabilization of microtubules within axons occurs via a bystander mechanism as a consequence of the presence of
lytic granular contents within the CNS microenvironment.

Cytolytic lymphocytes induce axonal damage
reduced numbers and function of NK cells in the peripheral
blood of patients with active MS disease (Kaur et al., 2012).
In contrast, a recent study using a similar NK cell antibody
depletion strategy resulted in less severe EAE that was ac-
companied by a reduction in IFN and TNF- production
by draining lymph node cells following antigen-specific ac-
tivation (Winkler-Pickett et al., 2008), suggesting a role for
NK cells in tuning the extent of adaptive immune responses.
NK cells migrate into the CNS via CX3CR1 and when defi-
cient mice exhibited more severe EAE, indicating that the
site of NK cell regulation is within the CNS (Huang et al.,
2006). However, once in the CNS, NK cells could contribute
to pathology by directly lysing CNS resident cells including
oligodendrocytes and neurons (Backstrom et al., 2003; Saikali
et al., 2007), or as our data suggest, induce MAD via a by-
stander mechanism.
The majority of MS patients exhibit a relapsing and re-
mitting form of disease (Compston and Coles, 2008), which
is consistent with reversible neuronal damage. To model re-
versible neuronal damage, we used an acute model of EAE
and previously demonstrated that accumulating neuronal in-
jury paralleled the clinical signs of EAE and was reversed
when the animals underwent spontaneous recovery (Shriver
and Dittel, 2006). Here, we extend these observations and
provide evidence that the damage is probably due to a loss
in the integrity of the microtubule structure in axons, the
consequence of which would be a defect in axonal trans-
port. Interestingly, transport defects are a common feature
of many neurodegenerative diseases, including MS (Morfini
et al., 2009; Neumann, 2003). A defect in transport would af-
fect both neuronal function and survival. Neuronal transmis-
sion is dependent upon the anterograde delivery of synaptic
vesicles containing neurotransmitters and proteins synthe-
sized in the cell body to the axon terminal. Similarly, neuronal
survival is dependent upon the retrograde transport of neu-
rotrophic growth factors towards the cell body (Guzik and
Goldstein, 2004). Intracellular trafficking largely occurs upon
microtubules composed of - and -tubulin subunits (Conde
and Caceres, 2009) on which the motor proteins dynein and
kinesin carry cargo consisting of vesicles and intracellular
organelles, including mitochondria that generate the ATP
required to drive the motors (Hirokawa et al., 2010). Micro-
tubule stability is maintained by the binding of MAP, the
best studied of which is tau (Johnson and Stoothoff, 2004).
Tau is a substrate for numerous protein kinases and its hy-
perphosphorylation negatively regulates the stabilization of
neuronal microtubules (Johnson and Stoothoff, 2004). Desta-
bilization of microtubule integrity has been associated with
transport defects resulting in the accumulation of cytosolic
proteins in discrete domains along the neuronal processes,
termed `beads-on-a-string' (Coleman et al., 2005; Trushina
et al., 2004). While highly studied in AD (Alzheimer's disease),
hyperphosphorylation of tau has been reported in primary
progressive MS and EAE (Anderson et al., 2008, 2010; Schnei-
der et al., 2004). In addition, changes in mitochondrial func-
tion altering neuronal metabolism, consistent with a trans-
port defect, is becoming increasingly reported in MS (Camp-
bell et al., 2011; Ciccarelli et al., 2010; Nikic et al., 2011).
While a sustained transport defect puts the neuron at risk
of death, our data demonstrate that MAD is an early event
that occurs prior to signs of neuronal cell death. What is not
clear is the contribution MAD makes to the ultimate death of
in vitro cultured neurons exposed to granzyme and perforin
that are present in the cell supernatants, cell lysates and
lytic granular protein preparations. The sensitivity of neu-
rons in situ to granzyme and perforin-induced cell death is
not clear, but such bystander cell death would be occurring
in the presence of MAD as well. Thus, our observations are
of clinical importance and indicate that if neuronal damage
could be reversed prior to the induction of irreversible cell
death widespread neurodegeneration could be circumvented
and may extend the time for patients to enter the progressive
phase of MS.
Our data indicate that cell­cell contact is not required for
lymphocytes to induce MAD and thus this pathology is prob-
ably due to bystander collateral damage due to the release of
granules following their activation within the CNS. It is un-
clear why lymphocytes evolved the ability to disrupt axonal
transport, but we speculate that it is to prevent access of
pathogenic agents to the CNS. Viruses, toxins and even pri-
ons gain access to the CNS from the periphery via retrograde
axonal transport. Given that cognate antigen is not required
in our model of neuronal damage, bystander effects on neu-
ronal function probably follow the activation of CD4, CD8 or
NK cells in the tissues at the site of infection. For instance,
immune cells responding to a dirty stab wound that are reac-
tivated at the site of inflammation causing the release of lytic
granules could induce microtubule destabilization causing a
transport defect thereby preventing the spread of tetanus
toxin into the CNS from the peripheral site. Thus, we propose
that a least some axonal damage associated with MS is po-
tentially a consequence of immune protective mechanisms
that are inadvertently triggered during a CNS autoimmune
response.
