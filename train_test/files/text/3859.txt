Background
Extensive literature attests to the salutary effects of social
support across a variety of diseases (Blazer, 1982; Broadhead
et al., 1983; Cassel, 1976; Cohen, 1988; Steptoe, 2000),
including cardiovascular (Berkman, Vaccarino, & Seeman,
1993; Kawachi et al., 1996; Uchino, Carlisle, Birmingham,
& Vaughn, 2011). Its mechanisms have been considered
from a number of theoretical perspectives, including the
health beliefs model (Montgomery et al., 1989) and social
cognitive theory (Bandura, 1994), among others. Research
has identified the importance of diverse supportive func-
tions, including receiving practical information, obtaining
direct assistance, feeling accepted by others, and other
stress-buffering aspects, which then appear to influence
immune function, mood, coping, and health behaviors
(Chesney & Antoni, 2002; Paykel, 2001; Umberson &
Montez, 2010; Wills & Fegan, 2001).
Less consensus exists regarding the specific dimensions
or types of support most likely to affect health outcomes. The
various ways in which support has been defined and opera-
tionalized across studies has prompted calls for greater spec-
ificity in defining the social support construct. This would
permit the evaluation of the unique contributions of specific
dimensions of support (Barrera, 1986; Cohen & Wills, 1985;
Fishbein, Triandis, Kanfer, Becker, & Middlestadt, 2001;
Mermelstein, Cohen, Lichtenstein, Baer, & Kamarck, 1986).
The emerging literature documenting differences in social
support across population subgroups is germane to these
considerations. Perhaps the most extensively studied dimen-
sion is gender. For example, men tend to respond more nega-
tively to support than women (Nagurney, Reich, & Newsom,
2004), but men may be more receptive to certain types of
support when attempting to modify health-related behaviors,
such as smoking (Westmass, Wild, & Ferrence, 2002).
Women tend to derive greater benefit later in life as a func-
tion of their broader support systems relative to men (Gurung,
Taylor, & Seeman, 2003). These studies highlight that type,
timing, and receptivity to support may be critical issues in
determining the ultimate impact of supportive activities.

Abstract
The impact of social support on health outcomes is well documented. The current study evaluated a short form of the
Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL-SF) administered to 14,257 participants in theAtherosclerosis Risk in Communities
study.Using confirmatory factor analysis,we attempted to replicate the subscale structure of the full-scale version.Additional
analyses were conducted to examine the relationship of ISEL scores to key demographic variables, as well as the relationship
with the Lubben Social Support Scale. We replicated the existing full-scale ISEL subscale structure in this short version.
In addition, subscale scores were found to differ across gender, race, level of educational attainment, and marital status,
although the magnitude of the various effects was modest. Correlations with another established measure of social support
provide convergent validity for this abbreviated instrument. Results suggest this brief measure of perceived social support is
a psychometrically valid instrument.An evaluation of its clinical utility is warranted.

Social support may function differentially across race as
well. Numerous studies suggest that members of minority
groups may maintain stronger and larger social support sys-
tems relative to European Americans in an effort to manage
an overall higher level of adversity in their lives (Broman,
1996; Holahan, Moos, Holahan, & Cronkite, 1999). A recent
study demonstrated that a higher quality of interpersonal
functioning among minorities appeared to protect individu-
als from experiencing more severe depressive symptoms
(Plant & Sachs-Ericsson, 2004).
The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study
provides a unique opportunity to examine these issues fur-
ther. ARIC is a prospective, population-based investigation
of the natural history of cardiovascular disease and associ-
ated risk factors in a cohort of European Americans and
African Americans in four U.S. communities. Participants
completed the ISEL-SF, a short version of the Interpersonal
Support Evaluation List (ISEL), which assesses the per-
ceived availability of functional social support resources,
that is, those supportive functions afforded by social rela-
tionships (Cohen & Hoberman, 1983; Cohen, Mermelstein,
Kamarck, & Hoberman, 1985). In the current study, we
sought to confirm the factor structure of the ISEL-SF as well
as examine differences in subscale scores across gender,
race, and other demographic characteristics. This study is a
necessary precursor to an investigation of the relationship
between the ISEL-SF and health outcomes in the ARIC
cohort, as it will provide important data regarding scale char-
acteristics and population subgroup differences.
Method
Participants
The design of the ARIC study has been described previously
(ARIC Investigators, 1989). Briefly, a total of 15,792
women and men aged 45 to 64 were recruited from probabil-
ity samples in four U.S. communities: Forsyth County,
North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi (African Americans
only); suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Washington
County, Maryland. Geographic and racial/ethnic balance,
census borders, and potential for community member par-
ticipation were considered in selecting the four communi-
ties. The initial examination, which included a variety of
physical, vascular, medical, and psychosocial measures, was
conducted during 1987 to 1989 (ARIC Investigators, 1989).
Follow-up examinations were conducted approximately
every 3 years through 1999. The ISEL-SF was administered
to 14,348 participants at the Visit 2 examination conducted
in 1990 to 1993. Exclusions from the analysis include 42
individuals not racially classified (self-report), as well as the
only African Americans (n = 49) from the Washington
County, Maryland, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, sites, leav-
ing a total sample size of 14,257.
Measures
Demographic information and self-report questionnaires
were collected by trained ARIC interviewers using standard-
ized protocols established for all ARIC study sites (see
ARIC Manuals of Operation: http://www.cscc.unc.edu/
aric/).
ISEL-SF. The ISEL-SF was included in the study protocol
as an index of perceived social support. The original 40-item
scale contains four theoretically derived subscales that mea-
sure conceptually distinct dimensions thought to buffer the
effects of stressful events (Cohen & Hoberman, 1983). An
initial factor analysis provided evidence for a four-factor
model, with moderate intercorrelations noted among sub-
scale scores (Brookings & Bolton, 1988). Because multiple
social, psychological, and health assessment instruments are
included in the clinical examination components of large
epidemiological studies such as ARIC, the time burden for
participants must be considered. Consequently, it is often
impractical to administer lengthy questionnaires. To reduce
the survey time burden for ARIC study participants, a short
form was derived from the original ISEL scale. The ISEL-SF
consists of 16 items drawn from the full scale. The items
selected were those that possessed the highest factor load-
ings within each of the four subscales from the original anal-
ysis of the full ISEL instrument (Brookings & Bolton, 1988).
The short form was constructed by the original ARIC
investigators as four 4-item subscales, consistent with the
original instrument. These four subscales are (a) Appraisal
Support (AP)--the perceived availability of someone to dis-
cuss issues of personal importance, (b) Tangible Assets
Support (TA)--the perceived availability of material aid, (c)
Belonging Support (BE)--the perceived availability of oth-
ers to interact with socially, and (d) Self-Esteem Support
(SE)--the perceived availability of others with whom one
compares favorably. The ISEL-SF also yields an aggregate
index of social support (TOT), ranging from 0 to 48, with
higher scores indicating greater perceived social support.
The ISEL-SF was modified from a true­false response for-
mat to a 4-point rating scale (definitely true, probably true,
probably false, and definitely false; scored 0-3), presumably
on an assumption of improved response sensitivity.
Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS). The 11-item LSNS
assesses structural components of social support (Lubben,
1988). Items address the number of family and friends and
frequency of contact. The total score ranges from 0 to 50,
and includes five subscales (not examined in this study). The
relationship between the LSNS and ISEL-SF was examined
to provide an index of convergent validity.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 8.2
(SAS Institute, 1999). Factor analyses were performed using
Payne et al. 3
a confirmatory approach for estimation and assessment of
measurement models (Hatcher, 1999). All groupwise com-
parisons for continuous dependent variables were performed
using ANOVA and ANCOVA, as appropriate. These analyses
were performed using the SAS general linear models proce-
dure (SAS Institute, 1999), with zero/one dummy coded
variables for multilevel categorical covariates.
Results
The average age of the current sample was 57 years, 55.4%
were female, 24.7% were African American, 78% completed
at least high school, and 79% were married (Table 1).
Internal Consistency
Cronbach's alpha was calculated as an index of internal con-
sistency, yielding an overall value of 0.83, suggesting a high
degree of interrelatedness among items. Indices for each
original subscale were as follows: AP: 0.67, TA: 0.66, BE:
0.61, and SE: 0.53. Separate analyses within gender and
racial subgroups yielded negligible differences.
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
CFA was performed using the SAS covariance analysis of
linear structural equations procedure (SAS Institute, 1999).
In the original factor analysis for the long form (Brookings
& Bolton, 1988), it was noted that items demonstrated an
extreme negative skew. This was also confirmed for the
present data set with estimates of skew ranging from -0.06
to -2.51. In all, 10 of the 16 items had skew less than or
equal to -1.25. To overcome these departures from normal-
ity, we used the asymptotically distribution free (ADF) esti-
mation method appropriate for large (N > 5,000) nonnormal
data sets. The CFA model was estimated, allowing the four
latent factors related to the instrument subscales to covary
without restriction. The model fit the data quite well, with fit
indices as follows: root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA) = 0.043 with 90% confidence interval (CI) =
[0.042, 0.045], and goodness of fit index (GFI) = 0.92. Table
2 displays the path coefficients for each item. Table 3 reports
the correlations among the linear composite subscales, as
well as the estimated latent subscales (see Tables 2 and 3).
Using the maximum likelihood (ML) method for perform-
ing the CFA resulted in a less optimal model fit than the ADF
method. The ML method resulted in an RMSEA estimate
0.082 (95% CI = [0.081, 0.084]), which was not less than 0.05
as typically desired to infer good model fit. The ML method
resulted in a smaller GFI estimate (0.897) than that of theADF
(0.919). Other fit indices included the following: Adjusted
Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI) = 0.8878 (greater than or equal
to 0.9 means good fit) and Normed Fit Index (NFI) = 0.631
(greater than or equal to 0.9 means good fit).
Demographic Characteristics
Correlations between subscale scores and age were either
nonsignificant or significant but of very low magnitude (r <
.10). We then analyzed data for gender differences, racial
differences, and Gender × Race interaction effects. Women
scored higher than men on AP, F(1, 14102) = 163.14, p <
.0001; BE, F(1, 14073) = 270.06, p < .0001; and TOT, F(1,
13920) = 42.50, p < .0001, scores. Men scored higher on TA,
F(1, 14072) = 24.39, p < .0001, and SE, F(1, 14040) =
23.09, p < .0001. European Americans scored higher than
African Americans on TA, F(1, 14072) = 163.47, p < .0001;
BE, F(1, 14073) = 10.97, p < .0001; and TOT, F(1, 13920)
= 11.74, p < .001. African Americans scored higher than
European Americans on SE, F(1, 14040) = 9.21, p < .003,
and there were no differences on AP (p > .15). Race ×
Gender interactions were evident for TOT and all subscales
except TA (Table 4 displays details and post hoc compari-
sons). For AP, BE, and TOT, European American women
generally reported the highest levels of support, followed by
African American men, African American women, and

European American men. For SE, African American men
reported higher levels than all others.
Marital status was related to subscale scores (Table 5).
Married participants had higher AP scores than divorced or
separated participants, F(4, 14101) = 6.7, p < .0001. TA
scores were higher for married participants than all other
groups, F(4, 14071) = 50.25, p < .0001. With regard to SE
scores, married and divorced participants scored signifi-
cantly higher than widowed participants, F(4, 14039) =
12.19, p < .0001. Divorced individuals also scored higher on
SE than single individuals, and married participants scored
higher than separated individuals. No significant differences
were observed for BE scores.
Higher educational achievement was associated with
higher social support scores on all subscales:AP, F(2, 14095)
= 57.72, p < .0001; TA, F(2, 14065) = 94.81, p < .0001; BE,
F(2, 14066) = 62.83, p < .0001; and SE, F(2, 14034) =
239.43, p < .0001. All post hoc pairwise comparisons across
educational levels were statistically significant (Table 5).
Structural Support
A moderate relationship was present between the LSNS and
total ISEL-SF TOT score (r = .45), as well as for all sub-
scales (AP, r = .37; TA, r = .35; SE, r = .26; BE, r = .38; all

ps < .0001, N range = 13,116-13,278). Negligible gender
differences were evident. Comparison of intraracial correla-
tions revealed higher values for European Americans than
African Americans on TOT (.47 vs. .38), AP (.40 vs. .31), TA
(.37 vs. .33), SE (.28 vs. .23), and BE (.41 vs. .31) scores (N
range for African Americans = 3,140-3,188; N range for
European Americans = 9,976-10,068). Thus, for European
Americans, structural and functional components of support
appear to be more highly interrelated, relative to African
Americans.
Discussion
In large studies, practical considerations of participant bur-
den often require compromises in the breadth and depth of
the assessments conducted. Brief measures with established
psychometric properties are necessary and invaluable. In the
ARIC study, an abbreviated version of the ISEL was
included as a measure of perceived functional social support
based on existing data attesting to the reliability and validity
of the original scale. The current findings provide support
for the ISEL-SF in that (a) the four-factor structure of the
original scale was replicated, (b) it was found to be inter-
nally consistent, and (c) differences across important popu-
lation subgroups were identified. The primary limitation of
this short form is that the small number of items precludes
the capacity to score the tertiary (third tier) subscales that are
available in the full-scale version.
With respect to reliability, the internal consistency esti-
mates obtained indicate a set of items that are highly inter-
related for the overall scale, and moderately so for subscales.
Given available data on the original ISEL, this was expected
and confirmed. In addition, the moderate level of intercor-
relation across subscales suggests the presence of somewhat
independent dimensions of perceived support.
It would have been useful to validate the ISEL-SF against
the full-scale ISEL, but this was not possible.Acknowledging
this limitation, it is noteworthy that the four-factor solution
of the original ISEL scale (Brookings & Bolton, 1988) was
replicated using CFA in the present study despite substantial
methodological differences, including (a) length of the scale
(16 vs. 40 items), (b) response format (true­false vs. 4-point),
(c) sample size (133 vs. ~14,000), and (d) sample character-
istics (college students vs. middle-aged, population-based).
In addition, the large pool of participants consisting of
African and European American men and women across
educational levels and marital categories from different geo-
graphic locations strengthens the validity and generalizabil-
ity of our findings.
Notable racial and gender differences emerged. Consistent
with previous research, women endorsed higher overall lev-
els of support compared with men. Subscale differences sug-
gest that women prefer to draw support from trusted
individuals and those available for social interaction (AP and
BE). However, men appeared to preferentially value support
from those perceived as similar or from whom necessary
resources were available (SE and TA).
Previous research has raised the possibility that the mod-
erating effects of social support on health outcomes may be
differentially related to gender and race, as well as the influ-
ence of specific support dimensions (Berkman et al., 1993;
Brownley, Light, & Anderson, 1996). In the current investi-
gation, European Americans indicated higher levels of over-
all support, including higher TA and BE; SE was higher for
African Americans. Examination of interaction effects
revealed interesting subgroup differences (Table 4) that sug-
gest the value of further exploration. Finally, the differential
magnitude of subscale intercorrelations across race suggests
that structural and functional facets of support operate more
independently for African Americans relative to European
Americans. It is unclear why this may be the case, or under
which circumstances this may be advantageous. One broad
possibility is that such an organization may confer greater
flexibility in the utilization of support resources. Alternately,
race may play a role in determining the nature and degree of
community cohesiveness and support. These observations
and tentative explanations await confirmation from further
research.
Higher levels of education were positively associated
with all types of support, again confirming previous work.
Similarly, results related to marital status suggest that being
married is associated with higher levels of AP, TA, and SE
support scores, as would be expected. The lack of difference
across marital subgroups on BE seems reasonable as well, as
this type of support may be derived primarily outside the
marriage. A somewhat anomalous finding was that divorced
individuals scored as high on SE support as married indi-
viduals. It may be that those who have ended a relationship
perceive they possess the personal resources necessary to
"move on."
While the characteristics of the ISEL-SF are promising, it
is important to consider that the constructs tapped by the
ISEL-SF (and original ISEL) are limited. A comprehensive
evaluation of social support on health and health outcomes
must also address complementary constructs such as struc-
tural support, negative support, social isolation, and other
factors (Mermelstein et al., 1986; Wills & Fegan, 2001).
Conclusion
The results of this study provide support for the utility of the
ISEL-SF as a brief, internally consistent instrument that
discriminates among individuals of varying demographic
characteristics. The large, diverse sample studied permits a
high degree of confidence in the stability of the results. The
full scale and subscales possess adequate internal consis-
tency to suggest reliable measurement of key constructs,
while the results of the CFA and evidence of a moderate
correlation with another measure of social support attest to
validity of the instrument. Finally, the brief form of this
Payne et al. 7
instrument underscores its value for inclusion in studies
where time is of concern. Future studies are required to
determine whether the ISEL-SF is associated with health
outcomes, and to elucidate the relative contribution of the
specific support dimensions addressed.
