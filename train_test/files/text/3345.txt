Many Americans deny anthropogenic climate change.
Why? Social scientists have identified many factors that
explain denialism (Kahan, 2013; Leiserowitz, 2006;
Whitmarsh, 2011); however, partisanship may be the most
consistent predictor. In general, Democrats accept the sci-
entific consensus and Republicans reject it (Dunlap et al.,
2016; McCright et al., 2014). Party elites are largely respon-
sible for this polarization ( Bolsen et al., 2015; Carmichael
and Brulle, 2017; Hetherington and Weiler, 2015). While
there is some within-party heterogeneity, independents are
largely divided.
Beyond partisanship, conspiracy theories claiming that
climate change is a hoax, communist ploy, or precursor to
totalitarianism are entangled in the debate. For example, in
2016 a Fairleigh Dickinson poll revealed that 41% of
Americans thought it true or possibly true that "global
warming is a myth concocted by scientists." Researchers
find that just exposure to climate change conspiracy theo-
ries can have a harmful effect on climate opinions and
behaviors (Jolley and Douglas, 2014; van der Linden,
2015). Their ubiquity has led scholars to examine if con-
spiracy thinking drives climate change denial. The prevail-
ing finding is that underlying conspiracy thinking exerts a
significant, though modest, positive effect on denialism
(Lewandowsky et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2015). However, this
finding is in conflict with most other research on conspir-
acy thinking, which suggests that the effect of conspiracy
thinking on politicized issues is contingent on partisan
identity.
To address this contradiction in the literature, we account
for the various ways conspiracy thinking could interact
with partisanship in a polarized environment to affect atti-
tudes toward climate change. Our findings show that con-
spiracy thinking is a more important predictor of climate
change denial than previously thought, but that these effects
are highly contingent on partisan identity. Our findings
advance our understanding of both climate change denial
and conspiracy thinking, suggesting further avenues for
research.
The conditional effect of conspiracy
thinking on attitudes toward climate
change

Abstract
Even though climate scientists are nearly unanimous that climate change is real and manmade, about 40% of Americans
reject the scientific consensus. Why? The largest contributing factor is partisanship; however, recent studies argue that
underlying conspiracy thinking exerts a positive, linear effect on climate change denial. In this article, we reexamine the
effect of conspiracy thinking on climate change attitudes by accounting for the various pathways that conspiracy thinking
could drive denialism in a politically polarized environment. We find the effects of conspiracy thinking on climate change
denial are not only larger than previously suggested, but also non-monotonic and conditional on individuals' party
identification. Moreover, we find evidence suggesting conspiracy thinking affects independents' positions, and even their
partisan leanings. These findings further explain why people reject the scientific consensus on climate change, and suggest
that climate change denial is not merely the product of partisan polarization.

Conspiracy thinking and climate denial
Conspiracy thinking (also called conspiracist ideation) is a
worldview that leads a person to view events and circum-
stances as the product of conspiracies, powerful actors as
conspirators, and authoritative accounts as fabricated
(Brotherton et al., 2013; Bruder et al., 2013; Lantian et al.,
2016). This way of thinking should be thought of as a spec-
trum: the more a person is predisposed toward conspiracy
thinking, the more likely he/she is to believe in specific
conspiracy theories (Uscinski et al., 2016).
Previous analyses find a positive and linear relationship
between conspiratorial thinking and climate denial
(Lewandowsky et al., 2013a), meaning that the more a per-
son engages in conspiracy thinking, the more likely they
are to reject the scientific consensus. This finding meshes
with extant literature showing that a stronger disposition
toward conspiracy thinking leads people to reject official
accounts (Wood et al., 2012). In this case, people regardless
of their party affiliation will reject the scientific consen-
sus--simply because it is the official consensus--as they
increase in levels of conspiracy thinking.
With this said, the findings of Lewandowsky et al.
(2013a) diverge from a long line of literature suggesting
that the effect of conspiracy thinking is conditioned by
party attachment (McClosky and Chong, 1985). Social sci-
entists show that people selectively apply their conspiracy
thinking based upon their partisan identity (Miller et al.,
2016; Oliver and Wood, 2014), and this is evident with the
conspiracy theories surrounding climate change (Douglas
and Sutton, 2015). Specifically, Republicans are more
likely to believe that climate change is a hoax while
Democrats are more likely to believe that oil companies are
hiding solutions to climate change (Cassino, 2016;
Furnham, 2013). Therefore, and given that different parties
offer different official accounts on climate change, there is
reason to doubt Lewandowsky et al.'s (2013a) finding that
conspiracy thinking exerts a positive linear effect on cli-
mate change denial, irrespective of party identification.
The conditional effect of conspiracy
thinking
Given prior results connecting conspiracy thinking to parti-
san identity, and given that elite cues are polarized on the
issue of climate change, conspiracy thinking can be
expected to push partisans' attitudes in different directions
depending on partisan affiliation. Thus, conspiracy think-
ing could drive partisans to "double-down" on their oppos-
ing positions, pushing Republicans to be more skeptical of
climate change and Democrats to be more convinced.
Alternatively, conspiracy thinking could also drive parti-
sans to accept positions opposite of their party elites, in this
case interrupting the signals coming from those party elites.
To account for these possibilities, our analyses interact par-
tisanship and conspiracy thinking.
This latter possibility suggests that, in order to correctly
account for the conditioning effect of partisanship, we need
to control for the possibility that partisans direct their con-
spiratorial thinking to elites in their own party. Thus, parti-
sanship, conspiratorial thinking, and the direction in which
the conspiracy thinking is aimed could interact to produce
different expectations about elite cues. Although partisans
are generally suspicious of the opposing party (McClosky
and Chong, 1985), polls show that some partisans--a minor-
ity--believe that their co-partisans are conspiring against
them (Uscinski and Parent, 2014). This skepticism of their
party possibly leads them to discount the cues coming from
their party's leaders and instead take positions closer to that
of the opposition. A historical example is the conservative
John Birch Society whose conspiracy thinking led them to
believe Republican President Dwight Eisenhower was a
communist agent (Hofstadter, 1964). Just the same, a belief
that the opposition is conspiring may drive partisans to take
extremely polarized positions because they will fully dis-
count cues coming from the other party and be even more
accepting of cues coming from their own. To account for
these possibilities, we include three-way interactions in our
analyses between partisanship, conspiratorial thinking, and
the groups that individuals believe are conspiring.
As for independents, the literature has paid less attention
and does not provide firm footing for expectations.
Conspiracy thinking may drive them to reject the existence
of climate change since it represents an official consensus
(Wood et al., 2012). On the other hand, conspiracy thinking
could drive independents to accept climate change because,
absent of the exposure to and acceptance of cues from par-
tisan elites, the broader information environment (i.e., sci-
ence, popular culture) accepts climate change and tends to
accuse carbon-emitting industries and denialist politicians
of malfeasance (Sakellari, 2014).
From the available literature, we present one hypothesis
and one null. The null reflects the current state of the litera-
ture (Lewandowsky et al., 2013a).
H0
: Conspiracy thinking has a positive and linear effect
on climate change denial.
H1
: The effect of conspiracy thinking on climate denial
is non-monotonic, and depends on party affiliation.
In turn, we will explore the effects of conspiracy thinking
on independents to provide new evidence of how conspir-
acy thinking affects independents, an important set of
voters.
Data and methods
Using data from the 2012 Cooperative Congressional
Election Study (CCES) survey (Ansolabehere, 2013), we
investigate the impact of conspiracy thinking and partisan-
ship on attitudes toward climate change while controlling
Uscinski and Olivella 3
for a series of demographic, social, economic, and environ-
mental factors. YouGov administered the survey online to a
nationally representative sample of 1230 respondents in
October 2012.
Dependent variable
Our dependent variable is each respondents' level of agree-
ment with the scientific consensus on climate change.
When prompted to express their opinion, respondents could
choose from five alternatives ranging from complete agree-
ment (Global climate change has been established as a
serious problem, and immediate action is necessary) to
complete denial (Global climate change is not occurring;
this is not a real issue). These options touch on both the
existence of climate change and the necessity of action;
they are ideal because they match the positions taken by
party elites. These alternatives were numbered 1­5.
Explanatory variables
Conspiracy thinking. To estimate the degree to which survey
respondents engage in conspiracy thinking, four statements
were loosely adapted from McClosky and Chong (1985)
and provided to respondents: "Events like wars, the current
recession, and the outcomes of elections are controlled by
small groups of people who are working in secret against
the rest of us"; "Much of our lives are being controlled by
plots hatched in secret places"; "Even though we live in a
democracy, a few people will always run things anyway";
"The people who really `run' the country, are not known to
the voters." Agreement with each statement was measured
on a five-point Likert scale running from 1= "strongly
agree" to 5 = "strongly disagree."
Since the above-mentioned survey items are all Likert-
type questions, we use a graded-response (GRM) item
response theory (IRT) model to obtain measures of latent con-
spiracy thinking (Samejima, 2016). The GRM IRT essentially
estimates an ordinal regression model of all Likert-type sur-
vey responses as a function of a single, latent predictor (viz. a
measure of conspiracy thinking), and two question-specific
parameters (viz. difficulty and discrimination parameters)--
much in the same way IDEALand NOMINATE estimate ide-
ology measures based on a binomial (rather than ordinal) IRT
model of "yay" and "nay" legislative votes. The distribution
of our estimated measure of conspiracy thinking is depicted
in Figure 1(a), appearing largely symmetric with a slightly
longer right-hand tail, indicating the presence of a few highly
conspiracy-minded respondents.
Partisanship
Partisanship was measured using standard three-point scale.
The boxplots (Figure 1(b)) depict the conditional distribu-
tions of our conspiracy thinking measure across partisan-
ship, which we would expect to be different if members of
one partisan group were more prone to engage in conspiracy
thinking than others. However, partisanship appears inde-
pendent of our estimated measure of conspiracy thinking.
Control variables
Scholars have found that demographic factors are predic-
tive of climate denial. Accordingly, we rely on the battery
Figure 1. Estimated conspiracy thinking: distribution of estimated conspiracy thinking scores across all observations (a) and by
party affiliation (b).
4 Research and Politics 
of demographics collected by the CCES to control for fam-
ily income, educational attainment, importance of religion,
race, gender, and age. Scholars have also found that local
weather can impact views of climate change (Egan and
Mullin, 2012); therefore, we account for respondents'
regional and local weather by including state fixed-effects
and the difference between historical average temperatures
in the respondent's zip code and the average temperature in
the month prior to the survey. We also account for news
attention, as news is a common forum through which elites
communicate to the masses.
Finally, and to account for the fact that attitudes toward
climate change can depend not only on partisanship and con-
spiracy thinking, but also on the direction of the conspiracy
thinking, we allow the effects of conspiracy thinking to vary
across respondents' partisanship and the partisan identity of
the groups that respondents believe are conspiring. To meas-
ure the latter, we rely on a question that allows respondents to
indicate whether they believe certain groups "work in secret
against the rest of us." We aggregate responses to this ques-
tion into four categories: No Groups, Liberals, Conservatives,
Other groups. Specifically, if respondents answered that no
groups work against the rest of us, we coded them as No
Groups; if they answered either "Democrats or other liberal
groups," "Communists and Socialists," or "Labor Unions"
(and explicitly said no to the conservative groups) we coded
their direction of distrust as "Liberals"; if they answered yes
to either "Corporations and the rich" or "Republicans or other
conservative groups" (and explicitly said no to the liberal
groups), we coded their direction as "Conservatives"; other-
wise, we coded their direction as "Other."
Results
Given the nature of our outcome variable, we estimate an
ordered probit model. As we are interested in evaluating
whether the effect of conspiracy thinking on attitudes about
climate change are conditional on partisanship, our model
allows the cumulative probability of believing climate
change is a serious issue to be a function of an interaction
between party affiliation, conspiracy thinking, and the direc-
tion of conspiracy thinking. Although the survey included
1230 respondents, we excluded 205 respondents who did
not answer at least one of the items involved in the model,
leaving us with 1025 cases on which the model is estimated.1
The results of our estimation are presented in Table 1.
The model fits the data significantly better than a null
(intercepts only) model, with a 2 test statistic equal to
494.5 on 88 degrees of freedom. While a saturated model is
still discernibly better than our own (with a deviance of
2535.02 indicating there is large amount of variation across
our 1025 observations yet to be accounted for), our model
still correctly classifies about 43% of cases. With five
response categories in our outcome variable, the classifica-
tion rate is roughly twice as good as chance would have it.
As interpreting the estimated effects of variables
involved in a three-way interaction is difficult to do by sim-
ply reviewing coefficients, we opt instead for obtaining
predicted probabilities of answering our outcome question
with the category "Global climate change has been estab-
lished as a serious problem, and immediate action is neces-
sary" (which we call the focal category) and comparing it
to the probability of choosing any other alternative. To cal-
culate predicted probabilities, we follow the "observed
value" approach (Hanmer and Ozan Kalkan, 2013), which
consists of taking N samples from the sampling distribution
of coefficients and recording, for each sample, an average
quantity of interest across observed values. These N aver-
ages across observed values are in turn averaged, and con-
fidence intervals are approximated by considering empirical
quantiles (e.g., 2.5 and 97.5 for a 95% confidence level).
Using the "observed value" approach also averages over
the potentially conditioning effects of direction that we
accounted for in the three-way interaction, allowing us to
focus on the conditioning relationship of interest: that of
conspiracy thinking and partisanship.
The quantity of interest is thus the difference in pre-
dicted probabilities of choosing the focal category for high
and low values of the conspiracy thinking variable, for each
different party affiliation label. The predicted differences
(i.e., the effects of a maximal change in conspiracy think-
ing) by party affiliation are plotted in Figure 2, with posi-
tive values on the vertical axis indicating an increase in the
probability of adopting a stance on climate change that is in
line with the scientific consensus. Furthermore, as we are
not holding the target of conspiracy thinking constant, these
effects correspond to marginal predicted differences across
said targets, allowing us to focus on the different effects of
conspiracy thinking across party affiliations while still
accounting for their conditional nature.
As the plot shows, the effect is significant across party affil-
iations. Holding all else constant at their observed values, and
averaging across conditional effects, conspiracy thinking
makes partisans less likely to take a stance in line with scien-
tific evidence, even if it means (in the case of Democrats)
moving away from the cues offered by their own party. The
effectislargeramongRepublicansthanitisamongDemocrats.
While the probability of choosing the focal category as a
response is 15 percentage points lower among conspiratorial
Democrats than among their non-conspiratorial co-partisans,
conspiratorial Republicans are about 28 points less likely to
choose the focal category than their non-conspiratorial
Republican counterparts. This provides support for H1
--that
the effect of conspiracy thinking is non-monotonic and condi-
tional upon party affiliation--and allows us to reject the null.
Understanding independents
Heterogeneity, and support for H1
, is even more pronounced if
we consider the effect among independents, where more
Uscinski and Olivella 5
conspiracy thinking is associated with a higher probability of
adopting the scientific consensus. Conspiracy-minded inde-
pendents are on average about 18 percentage points more likely
to align their beliefs with the scientific community on climate
change than their non-conspiracy-minded counterparts. This
seems to be the case among both Democratic and Republican

leaning independents (though not among "true" independents),
as illustrated by Figure 3, which replicates Figure 2 after group-
ing leaning independents with their partisan counterparts.
Doing so moves the effect of conspiracy thinking among both
Democrats and Republicans closer to zero (indeed rendering
effects among Democrats statistically indiscernible from zero).
To further explore our findings regarding independents,
we evaluated whether conspiracy thinking could predict
which way independents lean when asked about their parti-
sanship using a seven-point scale. We analyze independ-
ents, and predict their partisan leanings as a function of an
interaction between their estimated conspiracy thinking
and the direction of that thinking again using an ordered
probit model and relevant control variables. Although we
refer readers to our online appendix for specific results,
Figure 4 displays the predicted probability of leaning in
either direction as a function of conspiracy thinking, for
each of two types of people: those whose conspiracy
thoughts are targeted toward liberal groups, and those
whose conspiracy thoughts are targeted toward conserva-
tive groups.
As the overall increasing trend in darker shaded areas
indicates, conspiracy thinking appears to be a strong pre-
dictor of partisan leaning, with more conspiracy-minded
independents (i.e., those further to the right along the
x-axis of Figure 4) being more likely to lean Democrat--
particularly so when the objects of conspiracy thinking are
Conservative groups. In turn, the object of conspiracy
thinking is itself an even stronger predictor of partisan
leaning, with larger portions of the right-hand panel (which
presents results for independents who believe conserva-
tives conspire against them) shaded in dark gray as com-
pared to the left-hand panel (which presents results for
independents who believe liberal groups conspire against
them). In general, then, our model's results suggest a
potentially relevant mechanism through which the prefer-
ences of an important--if often ignored--portion of the
population are formed.
Conclusion
In politically charged domains, partisans tend to take cues
from politicians (Zaller, 1992), not scientists. With this
said, there is considerable heterogeneity within each par-
ty's identifiers and our analysis shows that conspiracy
thinking explains a significant portion of it. To change
minds, science communicators must battle both Republican
elites and conspiracy thinking. This makes changing minds

particularly difficult: even if partisan elites uniformly
came out in favor of the scientific consensus, conspiracy
thinking will still be difficult to overcome.
Our findings move the literature forward by detailing
the nuanced role that conspiracy thinking plays in shaping
climate change opinions. Our results show that the effects
of conspiracy thinking on climate change attitudes are
larger than previously argued and conditional on party
identification: conspiracy thinking drives Republicans and
Democrats to reject the scientific consensus, but independ-
ents to accept it (depending on how one operationalizes
"independents"). That conspiracy thinking drives pure
independents to reject climate change suggests that parti-
sanship is not solely to blame for denialism. Our results
suggest that not all partisans accept elite cues: conspiracy-
minded Democrats (excluding leaners) actively reject cues
coming from their own elites. Conspiracy thinking may
then constrain the influence of party elites in some instances.
It is important to note that our findings varied depending on
how we operationalized independents and partisans;
researchers should therefore pay careful attention to their
choices in operationalizing these important groups, particu-
larly in conspiracy theory research. Our findings also shed
light on how independents came to their position on climate
change and suggest further avenues for research into how
other worldviews drive independents in lieu of partisan
attachment.
