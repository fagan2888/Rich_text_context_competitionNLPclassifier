Background: Influencing adolescents' sexual behav-
iors has the potential to influence trajectories of risk for
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among young
adults.
Objective: To determine whether family, school, and
individual factors associated with increased duration of
virginity also protect against STIs in young adulthood.
Design: Prospective cohort study. Wave I of the Na-
tional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health oc-
curred in 1995 when participants were in grades 7 through
12. Six years later, all wave I participants who could be
located were invited to participate in wave III and pro-
vide a urine specimen for STI testing.
Setting: In-home interviews in the continental United
States, Alaska, and Hawaii.
Participants: Population-based sample. Of 18 924 par-
ticipants in the nationally representative weighted wave
I sample, 14 322 (75.7%) were located and participated
in wave III. Test results for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neis-
seria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis were avail-
able for 11 594 (81.0%) of wave III participants.
Main Outcome Measure: Positive test result for C tra-
chomatis, N gonorrhoeae, or T vaginalis.
Results: Controlling for biological sex, age, race/
ethnicity, family structure, and maternal education, ado-
lescents who perceived that their parents more strongly
disapproved of their having sex during adolescence were
less likely to have STIs 6 years later (adjusted odds ra-
tio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.99). Those with
a higher grade point average during adolescence were also
less likely to acquire STIs (adjusted odds ratio, 0.84; 95%
confidence interval, 0.71-0.99). Stratified analyses con-
firmed these findings among female, but not male, ado-
lescents. Feelings of connection to family or school, re-
ported importance of religion, attending a parochial
school, and pledges of virginity during adolescence did
not predict STI status 6 years later.
Conclusions: Perceived parental disapproval of sexual in-
tercourse and higher grades in school during adolescence
have protective influences on the trajectory of risk for ac-
quiringSTIs,primarilyamongfemaleadolescents.Mostfac-
tors associated with increased duration of virginity in ado-
lescence do not influence the trajectory of STI risk.

SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFEC-
tions (STIs) cause consider-
able personal and societal
burden in the United States.1
Strategies to reduce this bur-
den must target adolescents and young
adults.2 A recent population-based study3
found that 4.7% of young women and 3.7%
of young men in the United States be-
tween the ages of 18 and 26 years are in-
fected with Chlamydia trachomatis, and
that the prevalence of infection is substan-
tially higher among certain racial and eth-
nic minority groups.
Biological factors, sexual networks,
partner characteristics, health care, and so-
cial context contribute to the risk of
STIs.1,4-8 Sexual behaviors are also key de-
terminants of risk, and virginal adoles-
cents and young adults are at low risk of
acquiring STIs. Encouraging increased du-
ration of virginity is one strategy to re-
duce STI prevalence because the imma-
ture cervix is biologically predisposed to
becoming infected if exposed,9-11 and those
who delay initiation of sexual inter-
course (sexual debut) until they are older
often engage in less risky sexual behav-
iors.12-15
Wave I of the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health)
contributed to our understanding of the
characteristics of families and schools as-
sociated with delaying sexual debut in a
large nationally representative adoles-
cent sample.16 By using a conceptual para-
digm from the resiliency literature17 and
focusing on factors that were potentially
modifiable, cross-sectional analyses re-
vealed that adolescents who felt con-

nected to family, lived in families with good mental health,
and perceived that their parents more strongly disap-
proved of them having sex or using contraception were
more likely to delay sexual debut than comparison
groups.16 School factors associated with delay in sexual
debut included feelings of being connected to school and
attending a parochial school. Individual factors associ-
ated with later sexual debut included adolescents' feel-
ings about importance of religion, making a pledge of vir-
ginity, perceived likelihood of early death, number of
hours worked per week, perceived physical maturity com-
pared with peers, and grade point average (GPA).
Wave III of Add Health provides an opportunity to de-
termine whether factors that influence age of sexual de-
but also influence longitudinal trajectories of risk for
STIs--using biological tests. In this study, we test the hy-
pothesis that family, school, and individual factors as-
sociated with increased duration of virginity during ado-
lescence at wave I16 longitudinally decrease risk of
infection with C trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or
Trichomonas vaginalis at wave III.
METHODS
Add Health is a prospective cohort study following up almost
20 000 adolescents into adulthood.18 The original Add Health
sample was identified from 1994 to 1995, using a stratified
school-based sample of middle and high school students in
the United States. Wave I interviews were conducted in 1995.
Wave III occurred from 2001 to 2002, and included private
interviews of original participants (N=14 322) and testing for
C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae by ligase chain reaction and
T vaginalis by polymerase chain reaction. The original sam-
pling design, and all Add Health procedures, have been de-
scribed in detail elsewhere.3,16,19-21 For this study, we test
whether the wave I variables associated with age of sexual de-
but16 predict STI status at wave III. The University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board approved
all study procedures.
MEASURES
Outcome Variable
The outcome variable was a positive test result for C trachoma-
tis, N gonorrhoeae, or T vaginalis on wave III urine specimens.
Independent Variables
Demographic Variables. Age was categorized as 18 to 20, 21,
22, 23, or 24 years and older. All participants who reported that
they were of Hispanic or Latino origin were coded as Latino.
All other participants were coded as white, African American
or black, Native American, or Asian American. Family struc-
ture during adolescence was measured by self-report at wave
I, and coded as living in a 2-parent home (biological or non-
biological) or not. Highest level of maternal education was mea-
sured by the mother's report if she was interviewed at wave I
or by the adolescent's report at wave I, and coded as less than
high school, high school graduate, or college or beyond.
Wave I Family Variables. Previously described measures of fam-
ily connectedness (Cronbach =.88), perceived parental dis-
approval of adolescent sex (Cronbach =.90), and perceived
parental disapproval of contraception (Cronbach =.91) were
created from items scored on Likert-type scales.16,22 Family sui-
cide attempts and/or completions were measured by the fol-
lowing question: "Have any family members tried to kill them-
selves or succeeded in killing themselves over the past 12
months?"
Wave I School Variables. A previously described measure for
feelings of being connected to school was created using an 8-item
scale (Cronbach =.71).16,22 Measures for mean daily atten-
dance for the participants' school and school type (coded as
parochial or not) were obtained from wave I school adminis-
trator questionnaires.
Wave I Individual Variables. The importance of religion was mea-
sured by the following questions: How important is religion to
you? (There were 4 response categories, ranging from very to not
at all.) How often do you pray? (There were 5 response catego-
ries, ranging from at least once a day to never.) What is your re-
ligion? Responses to the first 2 items were recoded from 0 to 1 so
that lower values represented lower importance of religion, and
the mean of the 2 items was calculated as an index of religious
importance. Respondents who reported not having a religious af-
filiation and who did not answer these questions were coded as
0. Respondents who did report a religious affiliation had to an-
swer at least 1 of the first 2 questions to receive a score. The in-
dex was then standardized to have a mean of 0 and an SD of 1.
Respondents who reported feelings of attraction toward a per-
son of the same sex or a romantic relationship with a person
of the same sex were coded as having same-sex attractions or
relationships. The perceived risk of an early death was mea-
sured by asking participants to indicate the chance that they
will live until the age of 35 years. The number of hours en-
gaged in paid work in a typical nonsummer week was coded
as at least 20 per week or less. Self-report of physical appear-
ance was used to measure whether participants believed they
looked older or younger than most others their age. Grade point
average was calculated from self-report of grades in the most
recent grading period in English/language arts, mathematics,
history/social studies, and science. Virginity pledge was mea-
sured by the following item: Have you taken a public or writ-
ten pledge to remain a virgin until marriage?
ANALYSES
Descriptive frequencies were derived from unweighted data. All
other analyses used data weighted to reflect a nationally repre-
sentative sample using survey estimation commands in com-
puter software (Stata)23 that account for the stratification, clus-
tering,andunequalprobabilitiesofselectioninthestudydesign.20
We examined bivariate relationships between sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, wave I independent variables (family,
school, and individual), and having a positive STI test result at
wave III. We conducted multivariate analyses to determine the
ability of family, school, and individual variables to predict STI
status, while controlling for sex, age, race/ethnicity, family struc-
ture, and level of maternal education. Because many factors in-
fluencing sexual behaviors and risk of STIs may differ by sex,
we assessed separate multivariate models for female and male
adolescents.
In bivariate analyses, the range of each scaled variable was
divided into thirds. In multivariate regression analyses, these
variables and age, mean school attendance, and GPA were mod-
eled as continuous variables after confirmation that the as-
sumption of linearity was met. Multivariate models included
only observations with no missing values for any included vari-
able. For each multivariate model, correlations between inde-

pendent variables were calculated to ensure the absence of
strong colinearity. The 2 most strongly correlated variables
were perceived parental disapproval of sex and contracep-
tion (=0.57 in the full model). All other correlations were
below 0.40. Results did not change substantively when per-
ceived parental disapproval of contraception was excluded
from final models.
RESULTS
STUDY POPULATION
Of the 18 924 Add Health participants in the nationally
representative weighted wave I sample, 14 322 (75.7%)
were located and agreed to participate in wave III. Of these
participants, 1130 (7.9%) refused to provide a urine speci-
men and 226 (1.6%) were unable to provide a specimen
at the interview. Furthermore, 421 (2.9%) of the speci-
mens could not be processed due to shipping or labora-
tory problems and 951 (6.6%) did not have results for
all 3 STI tests.21 In sum, test results were available for
C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, and T vaginalis for 11 594
(81.0%) of the wave III participants.
Including participants who did and did not undergo
urine testing, just more than half (52.8%) of the study
samplewasfemale).Mostparticipants(54.2%)werewhite,
with substantial representation of African Americans
(21.3%), Latinos (16.4%), Asian Americans (7.2%), and
Native Americans (1.0%) (percentages do not total 100
because of rounding). Participants' mean age was 22.0
years (SD, 1.8 years).
WAVE III STI STATUS
Overall, 6.2% (95% confidence interval, 5.3%-7.2%) of
wave III respondents had a positive test result for C tra-
chomatis, N gonorrhoeae, or T vaginalis.
The prevalence of a positive test result for C tracho-
matis, N gonorrhoeae, or T vaginalis was slightly higher
among young adult females than males later (Table 1).
The prevalence was highest among African Americans and
Native Americans, intermediate among Latinos, and low-
est among Asian/Pacific Islanders and whites. The preva-
lence was higher among young adults with mothers who
did not graduate from high school and those with moth-
ers who had only completed high school when com-
pared with those with mothers who had some college edu-
cation or a college degree. Young adults who lived in a
2-parent home during adolescence had a lower preva-
lence of positive test results than those who did not live
in 2-parent homes. The prevalence of positive test re-
sults did not significantly vary by age.

BIVARIATE ANALYSES
In bivariate analyses, adolescents' perceptions of their par-

ing STIs 6 years later (Table 2). Of the participants who
perceived that their parents strongly disapproved of sex
during adolescence, only 5.5% later tested positive com-

pared with 8.0% and 8.9% of adolescents who perceived
that their parents had moderate and low disapproval of
sex, respectively. Findings related to perceived parental
disapproval of contraception were similar.
In general, adolescents who attended schools charac-
terized as having higher mean daily attendance were
more likely to acquire STIs than comparison groups.
Adolescents who attended parochial schools were less
likely to acquire STIs than those who attended nonpa-
rochial schools. School performance during adolescence
also predicted STI status 6 years later. Among adoles-
cents with a GPA between 3.25 and 4.0, 4.2% later
tested positive for STIs. In comparison, 7.2% of adoles-
cents with a GPA between 2.25 and 3.0 and 7.8% of
adolescents with a GPA between 1.0 and 2.0 acquired
STIs. Adolescents who worked 20 hours per week or
more were at lower risk of STIs 6 years later than those
who did not, and adolescents who perceived looking
younger than most peers were at higher risk of STIs
than those who did not.

WAVE I FACTORS THAT
LONGITUDINALLY PREDICT STI STATUS
IN MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES
Adjusting for biological sex, age, race/ethnicity, family
structure, and maternal education, adolescents who per-
ceived that their parents more strongly disapproved of
their having sex during adolescence were less likely to
have C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, or T vaginalis 6 years
later (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.89
[0.81-0.99]) (Table 2). Adolescents with a higher GPA
during adolescence were less likely to have these STIs 6
years later (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence inter-
val], 0.84 [0.71-0.99]). Other wave I family, school, and
individual variables were not associated with wave III STI
status in multivariate analyses.
ABILITY OF FACTORS TO LONGITUDINALLY
PREDICT STI STATUS AMONG FEMALE
VS MALE ADOLESCENTS
In stratified multivariate analyses, female adolescents
who perceived that their parents were more disapprov-
ing of their having sex during adolescence had a lower
risk of STIs 6 years later (Table 3). Female adolescents
with a higher GPA had a reduced likelihood of later
STIs. Among male adolescents, family, school, and indi-
vidual factors during adolescence did not predict STI
status 6 years later.
COMMENT
We confirm that STIs are common among young adults
in the United States, and that prevalence varies substan-
tially by nonmodifiable factors such as race and ethnic-
ity. This study focuses on determining whether modifi-
able family, school, and individual factors associated with
increased duration of virginity during adolescence also
protect against having STIs 6 years later.
Adolescents who perceive that their parents more
strongly disapprove of their having sexual intercourse as
an adolescent are less likely to be infected with C tra-
chomatis, N gonorrhoeae, or T vaginalis 6 years later. To
our knowledge, this is the first report of a longitudinal
link between perceptions of parental opinions about sex
during adolescence and biologically measured STIs. This
finding is consistent with previous research showing that
the more disapproving adolescents perceive their moth-
ers to be toward their engagement in sexual inter-
course, the less likely adolescents are to become preg-
nant24 and to self-report STI diagnoses.25
From a practical perspective, if parents who disap-
prove of their adolescent children engaging in sexual in-
tercourse convey this attitude effectively, then the long-
term risk of STIs may be reduced. Unfortunately, effective
conveyance of parental attitudes about sexual inter-
course seems to be challenging. Adolescents often have
inaccurate perceptions of their parents' attitudes about
their engaging in sexual intercourse, and the tendency
is for adolescents to underestimate parental disap-
proval.24,26,27 Furthermore, the correspondence between
parent and child reports of whether they have discussed
sexual topics is often low, and many parents underesti-
mate their adolescent children's engagement in sexual ac-
tivity.26,28,29 Taken together, this suggests a need to iden-
tify strategies to increase the congruence between
adolescents' perceptions of parental attitudes about sexual
intercourse during adolescence and actual parental atti-
tudes. Strategies will need to take into account the com-
plex process of conveying parental attitudes to chil-

We found that adolescents with higher grades in school
are less likely to have acquired STIs 6 years later than
those with lower grades. This finding is consistent with
previous research showing that adolescents with higher
grades are less likely to participate in high-risk behav-
iors across many domains,16 and that adolescents with
higher intelligence are less likely to engage in risk-
associated sexual behaviors.30 We cannot exclude bidi-
rectional relationships between academic achievement
and long-term risk of STIs. Others31 have reported bidi-
rectional influences between academic achievement and
age of sexual debut, with variation in these relation-
ships among adolescent boys and girls.
Our results show that the longitudinal risk of STIs is
influenced by perceptions of parental disapproval of sex
for adolescent girls, but not adolescent boys. The link be-
tween parental disapproval of sex and lower likelihood
of STIs in late adolescence likely works through influ-
ences on sexual behaviors (eg, fewer partners, fewer in-
cidents of sexual activity, or more consistent condom use)
or some aspect of partner choice (eg, monogamous re-
lationship, marriage, or "safer" partners). There is lit-
erature32 documenting sex-differentiated socialization by
parents, with adolescent boys being more likely to be en-
couraged to be independent and adolescent girls more
likely to be encouraged to be obedient. Borawski et al33
also found that adolescent girls report less negotiated un-
supervised time than adolescent boys. The link between
perceived parental disapproval of sex and lower longi-
tudinal risk of STIs among adolescent girls may be, at least
in part, the result of internalization of more conven-
tional standards or a stronger desire among adolescent
girls to behave in ways that will not result in parental dis-
approval.
We also found sex differences in the protective rela-
tionship between higher GPA and lower longitudinal STI
risk. Previous research30 has shown that adolescents with
higher scores on a standardized measure for vocabulary
are less likely to engage in vaginal intercourse and other
noncoital sexual behaviors than those with lower scores,
and that this relationship is stronger among adolescent
girls than adolescent boys. Our findings are generally con-
sistent with this observation. However, GPA is influ-
enced by many factors other than verbal ability, and it is
possible that higher grades, especially for adolescent girls,
may be another manifestation of internalization of con-
ventional standards and a desire to avoid parental dis-
approval--which in the realm of sexual development may
be linked to less risky sexual behaviors and partner
choices. Further research will clearly be needed to bet-
ter understand predictors of longitudinal risk of STIs for
adolescent girls and boys, and how and why these pre-
dictors may differ by sex.
Overall, our negative findings are perhaps the most
interesting. Family, school, and individual factors linked
to delayed sexual debut among adolescents16 in large part
did not predict STI status 6 years later. Perhaps the cor-
relation between early sexual debut and risky sexual be-
haviors (and, therefore, risk of STIs)12-15 weakens as ado-
lescents approach adulthood. Furthermore, it may be
unrealistic to expect broad protective models based on
the adolescent resiliency literature to longitudinally pre-
dict complex health outcomes. Future research will be
needed to better understand our negative findings.
There were several limitations of this study. First, we
did not investigate the process by which family, school,
and individual factors influence risk of later STIs, in-
cluding the potential role of sexual behaviors. Second,
the original Add Health sample was school based, so drop-
outs were excluded. However, Add Health has followed
up all originally enrolled participants, including drop-
outs, and previous research suggests that potential bias
because of missing out-of-school youth in Add Health is
small.34 Third, 24.3% of the original wave I sample could
not be located at wave III, and results of all 3 STI tests
were not available for 19.0% of wave III respondents. How-
ever, careful assessment has shown that risk of wave III
nonresponse bias seems minimal,35 and comparisons of
wave III participants who did and did not provide urine
specimens for STI testing have shown few differences.36
Fourth, the performances of STI tests on urine speci-
mens are not perfect,21 which influences the accuracy of
our main outcome variable. We are reassured by previ-
ous analyses quantifying the effect of nonresponse and
test performance on prevalence estimates that show the

*Data are given as adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval). The
odds ratios were adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, family structure, mother's
education, and all other variables in the table. Acquisition of an STI was
based on a positive test result for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, or Trichomonas vaginalis.

risk of this potential bias seems small.3 Fifth, if wave III
positive STI test results represent infections that have per-
sisted since wave I, we would overestimate the influ-
ence of our predictive model. However, it is unlikely that
these STIs would persist for 6 years because of the pro-
pensity of infections to resolve spontaneously37 or be ef-
fectively treated with antibiotics,38 which may be given
for other reasons. Of more concern, our STI outcomes
most likely reflect recent sexual behaviors; no serologic
studies were available to test for antibody responses to
STIs, which would more closely approximate cumula-
tive risk of infection. Sixth, the reliability and validity of
most independent variables have not been evaluated and
measures included few items (eg, perceived parental dis-
approval of sex). Seventh, our independent measures may
not have captured important dimensions of family and
school context during adolescence that may influence later
risk of STIs (eg, familial patterns of health care use), lim-
iting the predictive ability of our model.
In summary, our results show that adolescents' aca-
demic success and perceptions of parental disapproval
of sexual intercourse diminish the risk of acquiring STIs
in young adulthood, particularly for females. Further
research will be needed to understand how these factors
diminish STI risk, and to identify other strategies to
reduce STI prevalence among adolescents and young
adults. Parents should be encouraged to convey clear
messages that they do not approve of their children
having sexual intercourse during adolescence. Finally,
prevention and intervention programs will need to
account for the complex phenomena that contribute to
health problems faced by adolescents and young
adults, including STIs and the human immunodefi-
ciency virus.
