Introduction
Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and gen-
eration of angiotensin II (Ang II) have long been known to
play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of fibrotic kidney
disease beyond this system's hemodynamic actions.1
Pharmacological blockade of Ang II's generation and
action therefore has become a standard and essential ther-
apy in the management of a variety of kidney fibrotic dis-
eases. However, most studies to date show kidney disease
progression in many patients despite treatment with angio-
tensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angioten-
sin II-receptor blockers (ARBs). It has been assumed that
the limited renoprotection offered by ACEIs or ARBs is
due to uncompleted suppression of the RAS. One of the
strategies that could improve the efficacy of RAS blockade
is titration of ACEI or ARB for optimal therapeutic effect.
Emerging evidence has suggested that this approach does
confer a further decrement in urinary protein excretion, par-
ticularly with higher doses of ARB.2­11 Furthermore, higher
doses of ARB are generally well tolerated. However, large,
long-term trials with hard outcomes are currently lacking
for this potentially promising form of therapy. We have
shown that increasing the dose of enalapril or losartan
above the respective maximum anti-hypertensive dose pro-
duced additional anti-fibrotic effects in nephritic glomer-
uli12 when reduction of glomerular transforming growth
factor beta (TGFß) overproduction was chosen as the thera-
peutic targeting. However, glomerular or urinary TGFß

Abstract
Although angiotensin (Ang) II blockade has become a standard antifibrotic therapy in kidney disease, the therapeutic
efficacy of Ang II blockade is yet to be optimized. Considering the prognostic impact of proteinuria reduction, we
hypothesized that titration of Ang II blockade for optimal anti-proteinuric effect would improve renoprotection. One
day after induction of Thy 1.1 glomeruonephritis, rats were treated with increasing doses of the Ang II receptor blocker
valsartan in drinking water. Six days after disease induction, the therapeutic effect on proteinuria, podocyte injury and
glomerular fibrosis was evaluated. Increasing doses of valsartan resulted in increasing reduction of proteinuria. The
maximally effective dose of valsartan was determined to be 1000 mg/l, which reduced proteinuria by 80% and maximally
reduced glomerular matrix expansion, fibronectin, collagen I and collagen III staining and glomerular mRNAs for TGFß1,
PAI-1, FN and collagen I. Notably, valsartan given at this dose prevented podocyte dysfunction by preserving expression
of podocin and nephrin and the counter-regulating molecule B7-1 that is involved in podocyte injury. These results sup-
port the hypothesis that higher doses of valsartan are required to optimize proteinuria reduction and glomerulosclerosis
amelioration. Further, the optimal dose of valsartan also provides an additional therapeutic effect by preventing podocyte
dysfunction.

reduction is not easily monitored for titration of ACEI or
ARB for their optimal therapeutic effect in patients.
Increased urinary excretion of albumin or total protein has
become firmly established as an important progression pro-
moter of kidney disease, and reduction of proteinuria has
been associated with decreased risk of major clinical
events. To further investigate whether targeting the optimal
dose of Ang II blockade that further reduces proteinuria
may yield better kidney outcomes and to investigate the
potential protective actions, a systematic prospective study
with a broader range of doses of an ARB, valsartan (50 to
1500 mg/l in drinking water), was carried out in the rat Thy
1.1 glomerulonephritis model.
Compared to other models of kidney disease, the model
of mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis is one in which
administration of an antibody to the Thy 1.1 epitope on glo-
merular mesangial cells leads to immune-mediated, comple-
ment-dependent mesangial cell lysis. It is characterized by a
very rapid and marked proteinuria accompanied by glomer-
ular accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM).13 This
model has great relevance because it contains all of the ele-
ments of human fibrotic diseases, whether acute or chronic.
In addition, this model is reproducible and can be used to
very sensitively discriminate between therapeutic regi-
mens.12,14,15 Therefore, this model was chosen for titration
of valsartan for its optimal therapeutic effect in vivo.
We demonstrate that increasing doses of valsartan
resulted in increasing reduction of proteinuria and renal
fibrosis. Optimal anti-proteinuric doses of valsartan are
also required to optimize renoprotection. Further, more
complete Ang II inhibition with the maximally effec-
tive dose of valsartan prevents podocyte dysfunction
effectively.
Materials and methods
Reagents
Valsartan was kindly provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals
Corporation (Basel, Switzerland). Unless specified, all
other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.
(St. Louis, MO, USA).
Animals
The studies were performed in male Sprague-Dawley (SD)
rats (180­200 g) obtained from the SASCO colony of
Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA).
Animal housing and care were in accordance with the
United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The animal stud-
ies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
Committee of the University of Utah. Glomerulonephritis
was induced by tail-vein injection of 1.75 mg/kg of the
monoclonal anti-Thy 1.1 antibody, OX-7. OX-7 binds to a
Thy 1.1-like epitope on the surface of mesangial cells,
causing immune-mediated, complement-dependent cell
lysis followed by exuberant matrix synthesis and deposi-
tion.13 Normal control animals were injected with the same
volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Experiment design
A dose-response experiment was carried out to determine
the effective dose range of valsartan in anti-Thy 1.1 glo-
merulonephritis. Eight groups of five rats (n = 5, each
group) were assigned and treated as normal-control, dis-
ease-control and nephritic rats treated with 50, 100, 250,
500, 1000 and 1500 mg of valsartan per liter of drinking
water, as outlined in Table 1. Since the dose of 1000 mg of
valsartan per liter of drinking water (approximately equiva-
lent to 160 mg/kg per day) has been tested in animal study
and was not confirmed as the valsartan threshold,5 an even
higher dosage at 1500 mg/l was included in this study.
Treatment was started 24 hours after antibody injection
when mesangial cell lysis is complete and the fibrotic
response starts. At the same time, based on an average
water intake of 40 ml per day, 60% of daily dose was
administered by gavage as described previously.12
Thereafter, the water intake was monitored daily and the
amount of drug in the drinking water was adjusted daily to
the amount each group of animals would receive by drink-
ing 40 ml water.
Urine samples were collected from rats housed in meta-
bolic cages for 24 hours from day 5 to day 6 after OX-7

injection. The urinary protein excretion was measured by
the Bradford method (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules,
CA, USA). Urine albumin and urine creatinine were meas-
ured using the DC2000+ microalbumin/creatinine reagent
kit (Bayer Healthcare, Elkhart, IN, USA). Urine creatinine
was also measured for the calculation of creatinine clear-
ance ratio using the QuantiChromTM creatinine assay kit
(BioAssay System, Hayward, CA, USA).
On day 6, animals were anesthetized, 5 to 10 ml blood
was drawn from the lower abdominal aorta for detection of
plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels
(QuantiChromTM urea and creatinine assay kits) and kid-
neys were perfused with 30 ml ice-cold PBS. The creati-
nine clearance was calculated as the following formula,
(Urine creatinine levels/plasma creatinine levels) × 24-h
urine volume (ml)/(24 h × 60 min). For histological exami-
nation, cortical tissue was snap frozen or fixed in 10% neu-
tral-buffered formalin for periodic acid Schiff (PAS)
staining. Glomeruli were isolated by graded sieving as
described previously15 for RNA and protein isolation.
The dose results indicated that a valsartan dose of 1000
mg/l (40 mg per day, approximately equivalent to 160 mg/
kg per day) maximally reduced proteinuria, albuminuria
and glomerular fibrotic markers, so the effect of valsartan
at this dose on podocyte injury was examined in nephritic
rats, compared with normal and disease controls.
Histological analyses. All microscopic examinations were
performed in a blinded fashion. Three-micrometer sections
of paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with PAS. The
images (×400 magnification) of 20 random glomeruli per
slide were captured using a Nikon D50 digital camera
(Inkley's-Ritz Camera, www.ritzcamera.com, Salt Lake
City, UT; Nikon Capture 4 Ver. 4.3, Nikon Inc., Melville,
NY, USA), and the area of PAS-positive mesangium matrix
indicating mesangial expansion in each glomerulus was
quantified using a computer-assisted color image analysis
system (Image J 1.38 for Windows; National Institutes of
Health http://rsb.info.nigh.gov). The PAS-positive material
area in the mesangium was normalized by that of the total
glomerular tuft where the percentage of mesangial matrix
occupying each glomerulus was rated on a 0­4 scale (0=0,
1=25, 2=50, 3=75, or 4=100%), as described previously.16
Immunofluorescent (IF) staining for matrix proteins
was performed on frozen sections and evaluated in 20 glo-
meruli from each rat. Monoclonal mouse anti-cellular
fibronectin (FN) extradomain A+ (EDA)+ (Harlan Sera-
Lab Belton, England), goat anti-human type I collagen
and goat anti-human type III collagen (Southern
Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL, USA) were
used as the primary antibodies for detection of ECM com-
ponents. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated
rat F (ab') 2 anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (H+l)
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA,
USA) and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (DAKO
North America Inc., Carpentaria, CA, USA) were used as
the secondary antibodies. Intraglomerular deposition of
these ECM components was quantified as described pre-
viously.16 A whole kidney average positive staining for
matrix protein was obtained by averaging scores from all
glomeruli.
IF staining for antibodies against podocin and Wilms
tumor protein 1 (WT-1) was performed on frozen sections.
The polyclonal goat anti-podocin IgG (G-20) and poly-
clonal rabbit anti-WT-1 IgG (C-19) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) were used as
the primary antibodies. The Rhodamin (tetramethylrhoda-
mine-5-(and 6)-isothiocyanate (TRITC))-conjugated don-
key anti-goat IgG (H+L) and TRITC-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Laboratories
Inc.) were used as the secondary antibodies. Intraglomerular
positive staining for podocin was also quantified in a
blinded fashion by a computer-assisted method as described
above. The number of WT-1-positive podocytes per glo-
merulus was counted in 20 glomeruli selected randomly per
section.
Western blot analysis
Glomeruli from individual rats were isolated and resus-
pended at 2×104 glomeruli/ml in lysis buffer (Cell
Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) with 1%
NP40, 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and
one tablet/5 ml protease inhibitor mix (Complete, Mini;
Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN, USA).
Glomeruli were homogenized twice on ice by sonication.
Each 15-second sonication was followed by a 15-second
cool down. After two centrifugations at 10,000 × g for 10
minutes at 4ºC, the supernatant was stored at ­70ºC until
analysis. The same amount of glomerular protein (deter-
mined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay, Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA) from five rats of each group was
pooled. Twenty µg of protein samples were separated by
4­12% Bis-glycine gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and transferred to a 0.45-µm immo-
bilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford,
MA, USA). The glomerular protein levels of nephrin and
B7-1 were developed using polyclonal rabbit anti-nephrin
IgG and monoclonal rabbit anti-B7-1/CD80 IgG (OriGene
Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). The immu-
nostaining band was visualized and quantified using a
Bio-Rad GS-700 imaging densitometer as described
previously.16 Changes in nephrin and B7-1 protein
expression were determined by normalizing against the
densitometric intensity of its ß-actin (mouse monoclonal
anti-ß-actin IgG) for each sample. For comparison, this
ratio was set at unity for normal-control samples and
other lanes on the same gel were expressed as fold-change
over this value. All blots were run at least three times in
duplicated wells.

RNA preparation and real-time reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted immediately from isolated glo-
meruli using TrizolTM Reagent (GibcoBRL, Gaithersburg,
MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
RNA from five rats of each group was pooled. Two micro-
grams of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using the
superscript III first-stand synthesis system for RT-PCR kit
(Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR was performed using a
SYBR Green dye I (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA) with the ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System (PE
Applied Biosystems) as described previously.16 Samples
were run as triplicates in separate tubes to permit quantifi-
cation of the target gene normalized to glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Sequences of
primers used are listed in Table 2. The specificity of the
PCR products was confirmed on a 1.5% agarose gel by
showing a specific single band with the expected size.
Statistical analyses
Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Statistical analysis of difference among groups was per-
formed by Tukey multiple comparisons test; p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. The disease-induced
increase in a variable was defined as the mean value for
the disease control group minus the mean value of the
normal-control group. The percentage of reduction in dis-
ease severity in a treated group was calculated as before.16
Results
Therapeutic efficacy of valsartan
Effects of valsartan on renal function and urinary protein excre-
tion in anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis. The induction of disease by
the administration of OX-7 induced significant increases in
plasma BUN and creatinine levels (Table 3) and a signifi-
cant decrease in creatinine clearance rate (Ccr) levels, indi-
cating damaged renal function. Treatment with valsartan
did not affect plasma BUN and creatinine levels. The Ccr
levels after valsartan treatment in the drinking water were
not decreased but increased, although the increases did not
reach statistical significance. Twenty-four-hour urinary
protein excretions were measured from day 5 to day 6
(Figure 1). The induction of disease produced a marked
increase in total proteinuria at day 6 (Figure 1A). Treatment
with valsartan significantly reduced disease-induced pro-
teinuria in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of 50
mg/l valsartan to the drinking water reduced proteinuria by
21%. A maximal decrease of approximately 80% was seen
at 1000 mg/l valsartan (40 mg per day, approximately
equivalent to 160 mg/kg per day). However, the inhibitory
effect was paradoxically attenuated, with a further increase
in the valsartan dose to 1500 mg/l; the decrease in urinary
protein excretion was 55%, which was close to the effect of

500 mg/l valsartan (~48% reduction, p > 0.05). In order to
assess not only quantitative but also qualitative effects of
valsartan on proteinuria, we measured urinary albumin
level and calculated the ratio of urinary albumin level to
urinary creatinine level at various doses of valsartan. As
shown in Figure 1B, valsartan therapy similarly reduced
disease-induced urinary albumin excretion in a dose-depen-
dent manner, with the maximal reduction observed at 1000
mg/l. Similar to its effect on proteinuria, a further increase
in valsartan dose paradoxically attenuated the inhibitory
effect to that of 500 mg/l valsartan on albuminuria (Figure
1B). These results were consistent with those determined
by the ratio of urinary albumin level and urinary creatinine
level, as shown in Figure 1C.
PAS staining. Representative glomeruli stained with PAS
are shown in Figure 2A. The glomeruli from the disease-
control rats showed marked accumulation of ECM
expressed as PAS-positive material at day 6 (Figure 2A-DC)
compared to normal glomeruli (Figure 2A-NC). Increasing
doses of valsartan (50­1500 mg/l) produced progressive
decreases in glomerular matrix accumulation (Figure
2A-V50 to V1500). Figure 2B shows a graphical represen-
tation of the matrix score for each group. A significant (p <
0.05) decrease of 50% in PAS staining was seen in rats
treated with either 500 mg/l or 1000 mg/l valsartan, com-
pared to disease-control animals (Figure 2A). However,
this inhibitory effect was attenuated by 9% when an even
higher dose of valsartan (1500 mg/l) was given (p < 0.05).
IF staining. In order to determine the contribution of spe-
cific matrix proteins to the PAS-positive material, IF
staining for various specific glomerular proteins was per-
formed. The results of the semi-quantitative analysis of
those stainings are shown in Figure 3. Substantial
increases in staining for matrix proteins were seen in dis-
ease-control animals (2.1-fold for FN EDA+, 5.3-fold for
collagen I and 1.87-fold for collagen III), compared to
normal-control animals (Figure 3A­C). Treatment with
valsartan caused a dose-dependent reduction of these pro-
teins. The maximally effective trend for reduction of col-
lagen I and collagen III accumulation in glomeruli was
seen at the valsartan dose of 1000 mg/l, while the maxi-
mally effective trend for reduction of FN EDA+ accumu-
lation was achieved at the dose of 500 mg/l. Although the
highest dose of valsartan showed fewer effects on those
matrix protein accumulations in glomeruli (26% for col-
lagen I, 45% for collagen III and 52% for FN EDA+)
when compared to those of 1000 mg/l valsartan (33% for
collagen I, 53% for collagen III and 55% for FN EDA+),
the differences between the effects of these two dosages
did not reach significance (p > 0.05).

Effects of valsartan on glomerular mRNA levels of TGFß1,
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), FN and type I col-
lagen in anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis. As shown in Figure 4A­
D, glomerular mRNA analysis revealed a three-fold
increase in TGF-ß1, a 17-fold increase in PAI-1, a
12-fold increase in FN EDA+ and a 43-fold increase in
type I collagen mRNA expression in disease-control rats
compared to normal-control rats. Valsartan administra-
tion significantly reduced the gene expression of TGFß1,
PAI-1, FN EDA+ and type I collagen in a dose-depen-
dent manner. Consistently, the maximal effect for inhi-
bition of TGFß1, PAI-1, FN EDA+ and type I collagen
expression was achieved at the valsartan dose of 1000
mg/l. Valsartan maximally reduced TGFß1 mRNA
expression by 76%, PAI-1 by 65%, FN EDA+ by 76%
and collagen I by 70%, respectively (Figure 4A­D).
There was no further reduction of TGFß1 mRNA
expression when the highest valsartan dose was given (p
> 0.05). The effect of the highest valsartan dose of 1500
mg/l on the gene expression of PAI-1 and these matrix
proteins appeared to be attenuated to that of the 500
mg/l valsartan dose.
Together, these results indicate that increasing doses of
valsartan led to dose-dependent anti-fibrotic effects. The
maximal reduction in pathological glomerular fibrosis was
seen at the same dose of valsartan (1000 mg/l) that caused
a maximal proteinuria reduction. Since some of the meas-
ures we employed to assess efficacy were actually less
effectively blocked in the group receiving the highest dose
of 1500 mg/l valsartan when compared to those in the group
receiving 1000 mg/l valsartan but were similar to those in
the group receiving 500 mg/l valsartan, it is likely that the
true maximally therapeutic dose is between 500 mg/l to
1500 mg/l and very close to 1000 mg/l.

Effects of valsartan on glomerular renin mRNA expression in
anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis. Glomerular mRNA expression of
renin is shown in Figure 5. Induction of disease significantly
stimulated glomerular renin mRNA expression by 3.5-fold
(p < 0.05) at day 6. Treatment with valsartan in the drinking
water significantly further stimulated glomerular renin
mRNAexpression in a dose-dependent manner by interrupt-
ing a negative feedback loop.Amaximal increase of approx-
imately 5.5-fold was seen at a dose of 1000 mg/l or higher
dose of valsartan; however, the increase of renin expression
in the highest dose of the valsartan-treated group was not
significant when compared to that in 1000 mg/l valsartan-
treated animals (p > 0.05). These results also confirm that
the dose around 1000 mg/l of valsartan in drinking water
may reach the maximally effective dose.
Effect of valsartan at optimal dose on
podocyte injury
From data presented above, it is clear that valsartan reduced
albuminuria/proteinuria and fibrotic disease markers in a
dose-dependent manner in anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis, with
maximal effects observed at 1000 mg/l. It has been shown
that proteinuria is often the result of podocyte injury in
human diseases and animal models, including anti-Thy 1.1
nephritis.17­21 The protective effect of valsartan (1000 mg/l)
on podocytes in anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis was also evaluated.
Although the primary injury, i.e. injection of a comple-
ment-activating anti-Thy 1.1 antibody, OX-7, is highly
selective for renal mesangial cells, intraglomerular capillar-
ies are destabilized in the course of mesangial cell destruc-
tion, leading to capillary dilation and intraglomerular
microaneurysms after disease induction.13 All of these
changes will contribute to secondary podocyte damage via
altered physical forces and/or potential biochemical altera-
tions of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM),19,22
which may lead to the occurrence of proteinuria in anti-Thy
1.1 nephritis. Indeed, diminished staining of podocin, a
critical component of the podocyte slit diaphragm of podo-
cyte,23 was observed in the nephritic glomeruli on day 6
(Figure 6A-DC) when compared to that in normal glomer-
uli (Figure 6A-NC). However, staining intensities for
podocin were effectively restored after valsartan treatment
(Figure 6A-Val). The results of the quantitative analysis of
IF staining for podocin are shown on the right of Figure 6A.
WT-1 is a nuclear protein specific for podocyte and parietal
glomerular epithelial cells in the adult kidney.24,25 WT-1-
positive cells within the glomerular tuft excluding the pari-
etal epithelium were counted in anti-Thy 1.1 nephritic rats
and the cell number per glomerular was calculated as
described in the method. As illustrated by IF staining in
Figure 6B, consistent with the staining of podocin, nephritic
glomeruli from disease-control rats contained much fewer
podocytes than did glomeruli from normal-control rats
(6±0.46 vs 16±0.08; p < 0.05). The average number of
podocytes per glomerular cross section in nephritic rats
treated with valsartan was 50% higher than that in disease
controls (11±0.42 vs 6±0.46, p < 0.05).
By Western blot analyses of the isolated glomeruli from
different groups of rats, we also observed that the protein
levels of nephrin in nephritic glomeruli, another important
podocyte slit diaphragm-associated protein,26 were sub-
stantially down-regulated by 47%, compared with normal
glomeruli. Valsartan treatment significantly increased the
levels of nephrin by 36.4% (p < 0.05) (Figure 7B). B7-1, a
co-stimulation factor of lymphocytes, is synthesized in
podocytes in response to slit-diaphragm protein rearrange-
ment and foot process effacement.27 B7-1 protein levels
were also markedly increased in nephritic glomeruli (Figure
7C), which was consistent with the changes of the two
slit diaphragm-associated proteins nephrin and podocin.

Valsartan treatment reversed the elevated B7-1 protein
expression by 62.2% (p < 0.05).
In agreement with protein levels, the gene expression of
podocin, WT-1 and nephrin was down-regulated substantially
in this model (Figure 8A­8C).Valsartan administration largely
preserved the expression of these podocyte proteins. In con-
trast, as a marker of podocyte injury, mRNA expression of
B7-1 was significantly increased in nephritic glomeruli by
240%, which was reversed by valsartan treatment (Figure 8D).
Collectively, these data indicated that valsartan treat-
ment given at a dose that maximally inhibited proteinuria
and ECM deposition also prevented podocyte dysfunction
in anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis by preserving expression of slit-
diaphragm proteins and counter-regulating pathogenic
molecules involved in podocyte injury.
Discussion
In this study of the anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis model, we
observed that valsartan reduced albuminuria/proteinuria in
a dose-dependent manner, with the maximal reduction seen
at 1000 mg/l of drinking water (40 mg/day, approximately
equivalent to 160 mg/kg per day) and no further reduction
at a yet higher dose of valsartan (1500 mg/l of drinking
water). Together with the previous report that the maximal
effect of valsartan in the type 2 diabetic rat model was also
seen at their highest tested dose, 160 mg/kg per day,5 which
was the same dose required to maximize proteinuria reduc-
tion in the present study, it is likely that the maximally
therapeutic dose of valsartan is close to 160 mg/kg per day
in animal models. In the present study, we did not measure
rat blood pressure. However, it has been repeatedly shown
that the model of nephritis in rats is normotensive.12,14,28
The anti-proteinuric effect of valsartan therefore may be
independent of blood pressure. In addition, treatment with

valsartan did not result in any reduction in Ccr levels even
at a high dose (Table 3). The dose-dependent anti-proteinu-
ric effect of valsartan in this model therefore may not be
due to any reduction in GFR.
In corroboration with the effects on proteinuria, valsar-
tan in this study also resulted in a dose-dependent improve-
ment in kidney pathology. The valsartan dose that achieved
a maximal proteinuria reduction also induced maximal
reductions in glomerular over-expression of TGFß1 and
PAI-1, two powerful fibrogenic molecules, and the accu-
mulation of ECM protein. We and others have used other
Ang II blockers in the same animal model previously,12,29
showing that increasing the dose of enalapril or losartan or
telmisartan above the respective maximum antihyperten-
sive dose produced additional antifibrotic effects in
nephritic glomeruli. These findings in the anti-Thy 1.1
model are also consistent with the report in the 5/6 nephrec-
tomized rats, showing that a much higher dose of ARB
(losartan, 500 mg/kg/d) reduced histological evidence of
renal fibrosis more effectively than a lower and conven-
tional dose (50 mg/kg/d) despite a similar effect on blood
pressure.3 All these studies suggest that dosing is very
important. At the lower doses of ARB, only a moderate
antifibrotic effect was seen. It is likely that these doses are
insufficient to block most of the abnormally expressed
angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT-1R) in the kidney. Maximal
renal protection may require adequate doses of ARB.
We have observed that glomerular Ang II levels are sig-
nificantly increased in isolated nephritic glomeruli vs. normal
glomeruli.30 The antifibrotic action of valsartan is clearlyAng
II mediated. However, the mechanisms underlying the reno-
protective effect of valsartan independent of blood pressure
lowering are complex and not fully understood. Generally,
because Ang II stimulates mesangial cell proliferation,31­33
blocking its action sufficiently with enough dosing of valsar-
tan may maximally reduce proliferation so that the number of
activated mesangial cells overproducing TGFß and PAI-1 is
reduced and expression of downstream fibrogenic molecules,
such as collagen I and FN, is significantly reduced maximally.
In addition, it is believed that proteinuria is one of the most
important factors leading to the progression of kidney dis-
ease. Valsartan sharply reduced proteinuria. The exact mecha-
nisms of this action of ARB have not been completely
elucidated. With increasing attention being paid recently to
the multiple roles of the podocyte in maintaining glomerular
function,17,19,21 several lines of studies have demonstrated that
ARB has a potential to protect podocytes from being dam-
aged and thereby promoting reduction of proteinuria.34­37

Indeed, the podocyte injuries caused by the induction of Thy
1.1 nephritis were evaluated in the present study not only by
the amount of albuminuria/proteinuria, but also by the expres-
sions of podocin, nephrin, WT-1 and B7-1. The immunohisto-
logical staining of podocin and WT-1 and the protein level of
nephrin dramatically decreased, and those mRNA expres-
sions for podocin, nephrin and WT-1 also decreased in dis-
eased glomeruli. Podocin and nephrin are reported to be the
critical molecules for maintaining the barrier function of the
podocyte slit diaphragm.23,26 Dysfunction of podocin and
nephrin may cause the consequent podocyte shape changes,
such as the effacement of the foot processes, and may attenu-
ate the contractile function of the podocyte against the GBM
distention and then leads to loss of adhesion to the underlying
GBM and detachment.23,26 B7-1 is a transmembrane protein
normally expressed on the surface of B cells and other anti-
gen-presenting cells (APC) cells.38,39 More recently, it has
been demonstrated as a de novo synthesized molecule that is
involved in the induction of foot process effacement and dis-
ruption of the slit diaphragm protein complex in the podocyte
in response to a variety of stress conditions.27 In agreement
with the changes of the two slit diaphragm-associated pro-
teins nephrin and podocin, mRNA expression and protein
production of B7-1 were significantly increased in diseased
glomeruli in this study. Taken together with all of the observa-
tions on podocytes, it is conceivable that the marked proteinu-
ria in anti-Thy 1.1 glomerulonephritis resulted from the
podocyte dysfunction and even reduction of the podocyte
number. These findings suggest that not only mesangial cell
lysis and proliferation, but also the disorder of podocyte func-
tion, are involved in the development of mesangial alterations
and thereby further promote proteinuria and ultimately glo-
merular sclerosis in anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis. However, the
podocytic expression of nephrin, podocin and WT-1 was well
preserved and the elevated B7-1 in injured podocytes was
counter-regulated when the optimal dose of valsartan was
given. Since suppression of RAS markedly lowers glomeru-
lar pressure, lessening the mechanical stress with valsartan
may directly impose on podocytes. Moreover, it has been
shown that Ang II locally causes podocyte apoptosis, podo-
cyte actin rearrangement, increased TGFß1 and PAI-1 levels,
and reduction of nephrin levels.37,40­42 Thus, another mecha-
nism whereby valsartan may protect podocytes is by inhibit-
ing Ang II's direct and deleterious effects on podocytes. In
addition, there might be a pathogenic cross-talk that occurred
between mesangial cell (cause) and podocyte (injury) in anti-
Thy 1.1 nephritis.20,21 Ang II may act as the messenger of the
injury signal from mesangial cell to podocyte in this model.
BlockingAng II's action with valsartan may block this poten-
tial cross-talk, thereby reducing the response of podocyte to
injury. Very recently, Villa et al. also observed that high-dose
telmisartan treatment reduced podocyte damage as shown by
counting cells positive for both WT-1 and desmin and deter-
mining the expression of D1gh, a scaffold protein on podo-
cyte in the same model.29 Importantly, the protective effect of
high-dose telmisartan on podocyte injury strongly correlates
with the reduction of proteinuria.29 Apparently, podocyte pro-
tection may explain the reason why therapy with valsartan at
the maximally effective dosage markedly decreased albumi-
nuria/proteinuria.
An interesting finding in the study presented here is that
after a point, increasing the dose did not lead to further
reduction in any measure of disease, which was also seen in
our previous study.12 It therefore seems impossible to com-
pletely prevent the fibrotic process with ARB alone at any
dose. Together with the data that no additivity was seen
when enalapril and losartan were combined at maximal
anti-fibrotic doses,12 these results strongly imply that the
critical therapeutic factor for maximizing the renoprotec-
tion ofARB is dose optimization before adding other agents
to ARB at conventionally anti-hypertensive doses.
Finally, it is noteworthy that supramaximal doses of val-
sartan did not cause any noticeable side effects in the pre-
sent model, while reducing both proteinuria and renal
fibrosis. However, attention should be paid to the potential
side effects of high doses of ARB when a longer-term treat-
ment is employed in patients.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates a clear
dose-dependent therapeutic response for valsartan in the
anti-Thy 1.1 rat model. Proteinuria was reduced more
effectively at higher doses of valsartan. The maximal anti-
proteinuric dose of valsartan also conferred a maximal
reduction in renal fibrosis, associated with an additional
protective effect against podocyte dysfunction. Importantly,
these studies further illustrate the concept that ARB at any
dose may not be sufficient to completely prevent kidney
fibrosis. Combination therapy with other agents that act
through different pathways may be crucial.
