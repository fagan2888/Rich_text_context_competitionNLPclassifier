mass index and the prevalence of hypertension and dys-
lipidemia. Obes Res. 2000;8:605­619.
Objective: To describe and evaluate relationships between
body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure, cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and hyper-
tension and dyslipidemia.
Research Methods and Procedures: A national survey of
adults in the United States that included measurement of
height, weight, blood pressure, and lipids (National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III
1988­1994). Crude age-adjusted, age-specific means and
proportions, and multivariate odds ratios that quantify the
association between hypertension or dyslipidemia and
BMI, controlling for race/ethnicity, education, and smok-
ing habits are presented.
Results: More than one-half of the adult population is
overweight (BMI of 25 to 29.9) or obese (BMI of 30). The
prevalence of high blood pressure and mean levels of sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure increased as BMI in-
creased at ages younger than 60 years. The prevalence of
high blood cholesterol and mean levels of cholesterol were
higher at BMI levels over 25 rather than below 25 but did
not increase consistently with increasing BMI above 25.
Rates of low HDL-C increased and mean levels of HDL-C
decreased as levels of BMI increased. The associations of
BMI with high blood pressure and abnormal lipids were
statistically significant after controlling for age, race or
ethnicity, education, and smoking; odds ratios were highest
at ages 20 to 39 but most trends were apparent at older ages.
Within BMI categories, hypertension was more prevalent
and HDL-C levels were higher in black than white or
Mexican American men and women.
Discussion: These data quantify the strong associations of
BMI with hypertension and abnormal lipids. They are con-
sistent with the national emphasis on prevention and control
of overweight and obesity and indicate that blood pressure
and cholesterol measurement and control are especially
important for overweight and obese people.
Key words: blood pressure, blood cholesterol, high
density lipoprotein-cholesterol, overweight, obesity
Introduction
Obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular
disease, type 2 diabetes, gallbladder disease, cancers at
several sites, osteoarthritis, and total mortality (1­20). A
recent report described associations between overweight
and obesity and the prevalence of chronic conditions includ-
ing high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol levels in
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) III data (19). Associations between obesity and
high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and low levels
of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) have
been shown in men and women and in diverse race/ethnic
groups (6­19).
The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing,
and obesity is now estimated to be the second leading cause
of preventable death after cigarette smoking in the United
States (21­24). By contrast, national trends in blood pres-
sure and hypertension and in blood cholesterol and hyper-
cholesterolemia over the past two decades have been favor-
able (23,25­28). Levels of HDL-C increased slightly
although not consistently in older adults (27,28). These

favorable trends have probably not achieved their full po-
tential because of the increasing prevalence of overweight.
The increased prevalence of over-weight among children
and adolescents (29) may affect adversely future trends of
hypertension and high blood cholesterol.
Although the terms overweight and obesity are often used
interchangeably, overweight refers to an excess of body
weight compared with height; obesity refers to an excess of
body fat. In populations in which high levels of adiposity
are common, such as the population of the United States,
excess body fat or adiposity is highly correlated with body
weight (30). Thus, under these conditions, body mass index
(BMI) is a convenient and valid measure of adiposity. BMI
is calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the
square of height in meters (kg/m2). A recent review supports
the use of BMI in clinical practice (31,32) to define over-
weight (BMI of 25 to 29.9) and obesity (BMI of 30).
The present report provides detailed information on the
distribution of blood pressure and total cholesterol, and on
the prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, in relation
to levels of BMI for representative samples of white, black,
and Mexican American adults in the United States. It pre-
sents new information on relationships between BMI and
HDL-C. The results, based on the Sixth Report of the Joint
National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation,
and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) and
National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) defini-
tions of high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, are
relevant to clinical practice and public health approaches to
reducing the burden of overweight, obesity, cardiovascular
disease, and related conditions.
Research Methods and Procedures
Data Source
The NHANES are multipurpose health examination sur-
veys that estimate the prevalence of chronic diseases and
associated risk factors for representative samples of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United
States. The third NHANES survey (NHANES III) was
conducted in two 3-year phases between 1988 and 1994.
Data for all 6 years of NHANES III are presented here. The
survey consisted of an interview and examination in the
home and a detailed examination in a mobile examination
center. Detailed descriptions of the design and conduct of
NHANES have been reported (33,34). The cardiovascular
component was designed in cooperation with the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The protocols for mea-
surement of blood pressure, height and weight, and veni-
puncture and laboratory methods for lipid determinations
have been published previously (21,25,27). An interviewer
measured blood pressure three times with the participant
resting quietly, sitting in a chair at home. A physician took
three additional blood pressure measurements in the mobile
examination center. In both venues, blood pressure was
measured with a standard sphygmomanometer (W. A.
Baum, Copiague, NY). One of four cuff sizes (pediatric,
regular adult, large, or thigh) was chosen based on the
circumference of the participant's arm, as indicated by the
manufacturer's guidelines. Total cholesterol and HDL-C
levels were measured in blood specimens obtained during
the examination in a mobile examination center. All lipid
measurements were based on a single blood determination.
Adults were weighed without shoes in a hospital gown with
an electronic-load cell scale in kilograms to two decimal
places. Height was measured without shoes with a fixed
stadiometer and recorded to the nearest millimeter.
Complete data on age and race/ethnicity were available
for 8816 men and 10,009 women aged 20 years and older,
excluding pregnant women. Approximately 98% of men
and women had three to six blood pressure measurements
and information on current use of antihypertensive medica-
tion, 85% of both sexes had total cholesterol and HDL-C
data, and 90% of men and 87% of women had data on BMI.
Because of combinations of missing data, sample sizes
varied, from 16,681 in Table 1 (only persons with missing
BMI were excluded) to 15,645 for the high blood choles-
terol model in Table 6 (persons with missing data on BMI,
cholesterol, current smoking status, or education were
excluded).
Definitions
Four categories of BMI (25; 25 to 27; 27 to 30; and
30 kg/m2) were compared. These categories were selected
to correspond to various national and international recom-
mendations to define healthy weight (BMI of 18.5 to 24.9),
overweight (BMI of 25 to 29.9), and obesity (BMI of 30)
(32,35­39). High blood pressure was defined as mean sys-
tolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg, mean diastolic blood
pressure 90 mm Hg, or current use of antihypertensive
medication (25). This definition is consistent with the clin-
ical definition of high blood pressure in the JNC VI (40).
The means of three or more blood pressure readings ob-
tained either at home or in the mobile examination center
were used in these analyses.
High blood cholesterol was defined as total serum cho-
lesterol 240 mg/dL (6.21 mM). Low HDL-C was defined
as 35 mg/dL (0.91 mM) in men and 45 mg/dL (1.16
mM) in women (27) to reflect the higher mean in women
than men. This definition is different from that used by
NCEP's second Adult Treatment Panel (41).
Dyslipidemia was defined in some analyses as a ratio of
total cholesterol to HDL-C of 4.5. The same definition
was used for men and women.

Current smokers had smoked 100 cigarettes or more in
their lifetime and smoked currently; nonsmokers were not
smoking currently.
Statistical Methodology
Analyses used the 6-year (1988 to 1994) data from
NHANES III and SUDAAN software (Research Triangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC), which takes into
account the stratified cluster sample design and oversam-
pling of certain population subgroups (33,42,43). National
estimates were determined by using sample weights in all
analyses. Crude and/or age-adjusted prevalence estimates,
means, and SEs are provided by BMI category for non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican Ameri-
can men and nonpregnant women of 20 years of age. Age
was adjusted to the estimated year 2000 standard population
by the direct method using 10-year age groups. Age-specific
estimates are given for ages 20 to 39, 40 to 59, 60 to 79, and
80. The sample sizes for 80 and over were small; they
were included in the 60 and over age groups in some
analyses. SEs were calculated by a technique for complex
survey design and estimation procedures (42). Odds ratios
were calculated using logistic regression analyses per-
formed separately for men and women. The models were
identical for each risk factor and included direct effects for
the categorical variables BMI, race/ethnicity, smoking, and
age, and interactions between BMI and race/ethnicity and
BMI and age; education was entered as a continuous vari-
able (years of education). To estimate odds ratios incorpo-
rating the interaction effects for both sexes from Table 6, the
BMI odds ratio was multiplied by the odds ratios for age or
race/ethnicity and by the interaction terms. Reference cate-
gories were BMI 25, non-Hispanic white, nonsmoker, and
aged 20 to 39 years as appropriate. Age group and race/
ethnicity were also used as stratifying variables in the fig-
ures; odds ratios were estimated separately for each group.
Results
Distribution of BMI
As reported previously (21), the distribution of BMI
varied with sex, race/ethnicity, and age (Table 1). Greater
proportions of women than men had BMIs at the extremes
of the distribution (BMI of 25 and BMI of 30). Among
men, a smaller proportion of Mexican American men had a
BMI of 25. The proportions of men in the highest BMI
category were similar among the three race/ethnic groups.
Compared with white women, black and Mexican American
women had smaller proportions at the lowest level of BMI
and higher proportions at BMI levels of 27.
The proportion of men and women at the lowest level of
BMI (25) decreased with increasing age from 20 to 39
years through ages 60 to 79 years. The proportions at the

highest BMI level (30) were largest at ages 40 to 59 years.
Nearly half of the small numbers of men and women aged
80 and older had a BMI 25, whereas only 8% of these men
and 15% of these women were obese.
Blood Pressure
Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased
with increasing BMI in men and women (Table 2). Systolic
blood pressure was 9 mm Hg higher for men (131 vs. 121
mm Hg) and 11 mm Hg higher for women (116 vs. 127
mm Hg) in the highest BMI category (30) compared with
the lowest BMI category (25). The difference in diastolic
blood pressure between the highest BMI category and the
lowest BMI category was 7 mm Hg for men and 6 mm
Hg for women. The expected higher mean blood pressures
at older ages were seen within each BMI category for
systolic pressure, but diastolic pressures were lower at ages
over 60 years in both sexes.
Among men, the prevalence of high blood pressure in-
creased progressively with increasing BMI, from 15% at a
BMI of 25 to 42% at a BMI of 30 (Table 3). The trend
of higher prevalence of high blood pressure with increasing
BMI was similar for white, black, and Mexican American
men, but the age-adjusted rates were highest among black
men within each level of BMI (see Figure 2). The preva-
lence of high blood pressure increased with age among men
at all levels of BMI. The increase in high blood pressure
with increasing BMI was greater in the two younger age
groups (Table 3 and Figure 1). Among men aged 20 to 39
years, the prevalence of high blood pressure was seven
times higher at the highest (30) BMI compared with the
lowest (25) BMI category. Among older men (60 to 79
and over 80) there was a less steep increase in high blood
pressure prevalence with increasing BMI category.
Women showed a pattern similar to that of men with
respect to prevalence and relationship of high blood pres-
sure to BMI (Table 3 and Figure 1). The prevalence of high
blood pressure increased progressively from 15% among
women with a BMI of 25 to 38% among women with a
BMI of 30. The increased prevalence of high blood pres-
sure with increasing BMI was present in white, black, and
Mexican American women; however, the age-adjusted
prevalence of high blood pressure was highest among black
women at every level of BMI (Figure 2). The prevalence of
high blood pressure increased with age among women at all
levels of BMI. The relationship of high blood pressure with
increasing BMI was present in all age groups but it was
steeper in the younger age groups (Table 3 and Figure 1). At
60 years of age, women with a BMI of 27 had two to
four or more times the prevalence of high blood pressure
compared with women with a BMI of 25. Among older
women, the prevalence of high blood pressure was generally
higher in overweight and obese women than in leaner
women. Odds ratios for high blood pressure adjusted for
race/ethnicity, education, and current smoking habits are
shown for age-specific groups in Figure 3, where the greater
odds ratios for high blood pressure at younger ages are
apparent. When BMI, age group, smoking habits and edu-
cation were in the model, black men and black women had
significantly higher prevalences of high blood pressure than
white men and women, whereas prevalence rates were sig-
nificantly lower in Mexican American than white men and
women (data not shown). Education was related inversely to
the prevalence of high blood pressure in men and women.
Women, but not men, who smoked had lower rates of
hypertension (Table 6). Interactions of the relationships of
BMI with risk factors among age and race/ethnic groups are
described below.
Blood Cholesterol
Mean serum cholesterol levels increased with increasing
BMI from 193 mg/dL among men at the lowest BMI cate-
gory to 211 mg/dL in men at the highest category of BMI
(Table 4). Among women, total cholesterol levels increased
from 195 mg/dL at the lowest BMI category to 217 mg/dL
at the highest BMI level. In both sexes, cholesterol means
were consistently lowest at BMIs of 25 but did not vary
much with increasing BMI above 25.
Among men, the prevalence of high blood cholesterol
ranged from 13% at the lowest BMI level to 22% at the
highest BMI level. The age-adjusted prevalence of high
blood cholesterol increased with increasing BMI in white,
black, and Mexican American men, but prevalence rates
were lower in black and Mexican American men except
among obese men. (Table 5 and Figure 2). The rise in
prevalence of high blood cholesterol associated with in-
creasing BMI was greatest among younger men. Men aged
20 to 39 years with a BMI of 27 had more than twice the
prevalence of high blood cholesterol as men of that age with
a BMI of 25. A similar but less steep trend was apparent
at older ages. At all levels of BMI, the prevalence of high
blood cholesterol among men increased from ages 20 to 39
to ages 40 to 59, remained fairly stable in the group aged 60
to 79, and then declined in the oldest age group (Table 5
and Figure 1).
The prevalence of high blood cholesterol increased from
13% among women at the lowest BMI level (25) to 27%
to 30% among women with higher BMI levels; however,
there was no consistent rise with increasing BMI above 25
(Table 5). Trends were similar for white, black, and Mexi-
can American women. Hypercholesterolemia was generally
more prevalent in white than in other women (Figure 2).
The prevalence of high blood cholesterol among women
increased with age, through ages 60 to 79, then decreased at
all levels of BMI. The increase in prevalence with increas-
ing BMI was greatest in the younger age groups, and most

of the increase occurred from a BMI of 25 to a BMI of 25
to 27 (Table 5 and Figure 1).
In regression analyses controlling for race/ethnicity, ed-
ucation, and smoking, the odds ratios for high blood cho-
lesterol were higher at BMIs of 25 compared with BMIs
of 25 (Figure 3). Hypercholesterolemia was not related to
education or smoking in either sex (Table 6).
HDL-C
Mean levels of HDL-C were 10 mg/dL higher in
women than in men and they decreased with increasing
BMI in both sexes (Table 4). The mean HDL-C level for
men with BMI 25 was 50 mg/dL and it declined to 40
mg/dL at a BMI 30. Among women, the age-adjusted
mean HDL-C level decreased from 59 mg/dL for women
with a BMI of 25 to 49 mg/dL for women with a BMI of
30 (Table 4). Age-adjusted mean HDL-C levels were
generally higher in black men and women than in white or
Mexican American men or women in all BMI groups (data
not shown). The decline with increasing BMI was present
among men and women in all race/ethnic groups and age
groups.
Among men, the age-adjusted prevalence of low levels of
HDL-C (35 mg/dL) increased with increasing levels of
BMI from 9% to 31% (Table 5). Black men had the lowest
prevalence of low HDL at all levels of BMI (Figure 2).
However, the pattern of increasing prevalence of low HDL
with increasing BMI was generally similar among the three
race/ethnic groups and among men in all age groups, in-
cluding those 80 and older.
Among women, the age-adjusted prevalence of low
HDL-C (45 mg/dL) showed a pattern similar to that in
men, increasing from 17% at a BMI of 25 to 41% at a
BMI of 30. The prevalence of low HDL-C was lowest
among black women; it tended to be higher in Mexican
American than white women at every level of BMI.

However, the overall pattern of increasing prevalence of
low HDL-C with increasing BMI was present among
women in all race/ethnic groups and most age groups (Fig-
ures 1 and 2).
There was no consistent stepwise pattern of increasing
prevalence of low HDL with increasing age in men or
women. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of low
levels of HDL-C with increasing BMI was greater in
younger men and women, where it was about twice as high
in the overweight and three times as high in the obese
groups as in the leanest groups (Table 5 and Figure 1). In
regression analyses, low HDL-C was related positively to
BMI, white vs. black race, and cigarette smoking; it was
related inversely to years of education in women but not in
men. Odds ratios for low HDL increased with increasing
categories of BMI when race/ethnicity, smoking habits, and
years of education were controlled (Figure 3 and Table 6).
In age group-specific analyses, odds ratios were highest in
the two youngest groups of men and the youngest group of
women (Figure 3).
Dyslipidemia
When dyslipidemia was defined as a ratio of total cho-
lesterol to HDL-C of 4.5, the prevalence of this condition
increased with increasing BMI level in both sexes and all
race/ethnic groups. Prevalence rates were lower at ages 20
to 39 and increased with age in women but were lower in
the oldest men compared with those aged 40 to 79 years.
Prevalence rates were lower in black men and women
compared with other men and women (data not shown).
Hypertension and Dyslipidemia
The percentages of men and women with both high blood
pressure and a lipid abnormality are shown in Figure 1, and
the adjusted odds ratios are shown in Table 6 and Figures 2
and 3. The patterns of the combined prevalence of the two
risk factors with increasing BMI and age are generally as
expected from the patterns present for each risk factor
separately; the association of BMI with both conditions
together was strong in all analyses. Adjusted odds ratios
increased across categories of BMI. Odds ratios for both
abnormalities were generally lower in Mexican Americans
than in whites or blacks, among women in smokers than
nonsmokers, and in women with more education.
Multivariate Odds Ratios
Relationships between BMI and risk factors vary with
sex, age, and race/ethnic group as shown in Tables 2
through 5 and Figures 1 through 3. The results of including
interaction terms for BMI and age and for BMI and race/
ethnicity in multivariate models are shown in Table 6. The
effect of BMI on high blood pressure is different for whites,
blacks, and Mexican Americans as suggested by inspection
of Figure 2 and confirmed by the analysis in Table 6. For
example, the odds ratios for high blood pressure show that
the chances of having high blood pressure with a BMI of 25
to 27 compared with a BMI of 25 is 2.4 times greater at
ages 20 to 39 for white men (2.4  1.0  1.0) and Mexican

race and the interaction between BMI and age were signif-
icant for all risk factors except high blood cholesterol. In
addition, the interaction between BMI and race/ethnicity
was significant in women for all risk factors except low
HDL cholesterol. In the multivariate models, the r2 coeffi-
cients ranged from a high of 0.32 for high blood pressure
among women to a low of 0.03 for high blood cholesterol

10% of the variance of each risk factor among men and only
18% among women.
Discussion
These data show in greater detail the previously described
positive relationships of BMI to systolic and diastolic blood
pressures, and total cholesterol levels, as well as the nega-
tive relationship of BMI to HDL-C levels. In general, the
prevalence of hypertension, high blood cholesterol, low
HDL-C, and high total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio increase
with increasing BMI, as does the combined prevalence of
both hypertension and dyslipidemia. These relationships are
found among men and women in all race/ethnic groups and
in most age groups. Relative risks assessed by odds ratios
are greater at younger ages, but prevalences of overweight,
obesity, hypertension, and lipid abnormalities are higher at
older ages. Odds ratios also vary among race/ethnic groups
as indicated by the significant interaction terms. Although
the impact of higher levels of BMI on prevalence of high
blood pressure, abnormal lipids, and the two abnormalities
together varies in terms of magnitude with sex, age, and
race/ethnicity, the importance of increasing BMI as a de-
terminant of these conditions is clear.
The inverse relationship between cigarette smoking and
weight is well documented (44), and cigarette smokers have
lower levels of HDL-C (45). Thus, failure to control for
cigarette smoking will result in an underestimate of the
association between BMI and low HDL-C.
Cardiovascular risk factors are also known to vary in-
versely with level of education and to cluster among those
with the least amount of education. However, the relation-
ship of BMI with high blood pressure and abnormal lipids
persists when smoking habits and education as well as age
and race/ethnicity are controlled in regression analyses. In
other analyses based on NHANES III data, Must et al. (19)

reported increased prevalence ratios by increasing severity
of overweight and obesity for several health conditions,
including high blood pressure. They also found higher prev-
alence ratios for high blood cholesterol among overweight
and obese men and women than among normal weight
persons. These investigators used different categories of
BMI, different criteria to define high blood pressure and
high blood cholesterol, and different analytic approaches
than ours. Although their estimates of prevalence ratios and
our odds ratios cannot be compared directly, results of
the two studies are strongly concordant in identifying BMI
as a risk factor for high blood pressure and high blood
cholesterol.
Although cross-sectional studies do not provide informa-
tion on the sequence of risk factor development, and cause-
and-effect relationships cannot be inferred, these findings
are consistent with the cross-sectional, longitudinal, and
clinical studies that show cardiovascular risk factors are
more prevalent among overweight and obese people. Cross-
sectional studies in the United States and other countries
have reported such relationships in both sexes, in a variety
of ethnic groups, and in children and adults (11,13­19).
Associations of adiposity at baseline and incidence of hy-
pertension and dyslipidemia have been shown in large pro-
spective cohort studies (3,5,6,10,12,46). Clinical trials have
shown the effect of weight loss on lowering blood pressures
and improving lipid values (32,47­56). The science base for
concluding that higher levels of body mass are causally
related to higher levels of blood pressure and total choles-
terol and lower levels of HDL-C is substantial
and convincing.
National data show that whereas levels of blood pressure
and cholesterol declined and HDL-C generally increased,
mean levels of BMI and overweight and obesity increased
over recent decades. The decline in mean systolic and
diastolic blood pressures between 1976 and 1980 and 1988

and 1991 occurred at all BMI levels (26). It has been
suggested that the declining use of alcohol and dietary salt
may have a role in the decline in the prevalence of high
blood pressure, despite the increase in obesity (9). The
beneficial trend in cholesterol is probably related to dietary
changes (57), because only 2% of the population was
using cholesterol-lowering medications during this time pe-
riod (58). Previous analyses of the NHANES data have
shown that the mean percentage of calories from total
dietary fat and from saturated fat decreased from 1976 to
1980 and from 1988 to 1991; however, during that time,
reported intake of total calories increased (56). Changes in
calorie intake may reflect increased consumption or im-
proved changes in the dietary protocol to obtain more com-
plete intake information (59). Increased levels of physical
inactivity (60,61) as well as caloric intakes that are too high
in relation to physical activity levels are probable explana-
tions for the rising prevalence of overweight (32).
Smoking cessation has been shown to be related to
weight gain. The prevalence of cigarette smoking has de-
clined dramatically over the past 30 years, and a large
proportion of the population has quit smoking (23). Re-
views of the relationship between weight gain and smoking
cessation have estimated that quitting smoking results in an
average weight gain of between 4.5 and 7.5 pounds (50).
From the NHANES III data, estimates of weight gain due to
smoking cessation were 10 to 11 pounds. But smoking
cessation accounted for only a small part of the recent
increase in the prevalence of overweight; approximately
one-quarter of the increase among men and approximately
one-sixth of the increase among women could be attributed
to smoking cessation (62,63).
Limitations of this report include the fact that although
BMI is highly correlated with body fatness (0.7 to 0.8) (64),
it measures lean body mass as well as fat mass. It has been
suggested that central, particularly visceral, fat is a more
important contributor to cardiovascular risk than total body
fat. Measures of regional adiposity such as waist circum-
ference, waist-to-hip ratio, and subscapular to triceps skin-
fold thickness correlate highly with other measures of over-
weight such as BMI and may be even more strongly
correlated with lipoprotein cholesterol fractions (64). How-
ever, the BMI-risk factor relationships have been shown to
be independent of the measures used to characterize body
weight or fat distribution. Some variability in the associa-
tion of BMI and risk factors by sex, race/ethnic, and age
groups is to be expected, given biological variability in
blood pressure, total cholesterol, and HDL-C, and the im-
portance of factors such as heredity, diet, and exercise,
which are known to influence these variables.
The adverse relationship between BMI and cardiovascu-
lar risk factors is likely to be understated in these analyses
because information on diabetes was not considered. Recent
reports implicating overweight as a potent factor in the
etiology of type 2 diabetes include an analysis of NHANES
III data in which prevalence ratios for diabetes increased
steeply with increasing levels of BMI; they were 2 to 18
times higher in obese than normal weight men and women,
depending on the severity of obesity (19). A study of
middle-aged women found that a BMI of 23 to 25 was
associated with a fourfold increase in risk for diabetes
mellitus compared with a BMI 22. These reports suggest
that optimal weight for height may be lower than a BMI of
25 (46,65), but being underweight is also associated with
excess morbidity and mortality (19,20,32).
Conclusion
The high prevalence of overweight is a major public health
problem in the United States. Thirty-nine million Ameri-
cans are estimated to have a BMI of 30 and an additional
57 million to have a BMI of 25 to 29.9. This study quan-
tifies for a representative national sample of the adult pop-
ulation the distribution of BMI, the relationship between
BMI and blood pressure and lipid levels, and the excess
prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, separately
and in combination among persons with a BMI of 25.
These findings indicate that levels of cardiovascular risk
factors are substantially lower at a BMI of 25 than at
higher BMI levels and suggest that levels of BMI that are
used to define optimal weight, overweight, and obesity
should take into account the strong and consistent relation-
ships between BMI and cardiovascular risk factors and
other health-related characteristics. Applying these preva-
lence estimates to the population yields estimates that 28
million Americans are obese (BMI of 30) and have high
blood pressure, dyslipidemia, or both. Among those who are
overweight (BMI of 25 to 29.9), 37 million have hyperten-
sion, dyslipidemia, or both conditions. Relative risks (indi-
cated by odds ratios) and absolute risks (indicated by prev-
alence rates) are both important in determining clinical
practice and public health approaches to case finding, treat-
ment, and prevention of overweight, obesity, high blood
pressure, lipid abnormalities, and related conditions.
