Explaining Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Use
of High-Volume Hospitals: Decision-Making
Complexity and Local Hospital Environments
Karl Kronebusch1, Bradford H. Gray2, and Mark Schlesinger3
Abstract
Racial/ethnic minorities are less likely to use higher-quality hospitals than whites. We propose that a higher level of information-
related complexity in their local hospital environments compounds the effects of discrimination and more limited access to
services, contributing to racial/ethnic disparities in hospital use. While minorities live closer than whites to high-volume
hospitals, minorities also face greater choice complexity and live in neighborhoods with lower levels of medical experience.
Our empirical results reveal that it is generally the overall context associated with proximity, choice complexity, and local
experience, rather than differential sensitivity to these factors, that provides a partial explanation of the disparity gap in high-
volume hospital use.

Introduction
Racial/ethnic disparities in health status and medical utiliza-
tion have become a focus of research (Institute of Medicine
[IOM], 2003) and a concern for policy makers (Ladenheim
and Groman 2006). While a portion of these disparities can be
attributed to insurance coverage and broader socio-economic
differences, even after accounting for these factors, there
remain health care disparities (IOM 2003; Medical Care
Research and Review [MCRR], 2000). Only about 20 to 25
percent of the nation's physicians and hospitals provide most
medical care for minority patients (Bach et al. 2004; Jha et al.
2007; Jha et al. 2008), and a range of quality disparities are
associated with these providers and facilities: broad quality
measures are lower for the hospitals and nursing homes used
by minorities (Gaskin et al. 2008; Hasnain-Wynia et al. 2007;
Hasnain-Wynia et al. 2010; Jha et al. 2007; Jha et al. 2008;
Smith et al. 2007); process measures for specific conditions
indicate lower quality (Barnato et al. 2005; Bradley et al.
2004); and minority patients are less likely to receive new
treatment technologies (Groeneveld, Laufer, and Garber
2005). Blacks receive care from hospitals and surgeons with
higher mortality rates (Clarke, Davis, and Nailon 2007;
Konety, Vaughan Sarrazin, and Rosenthal 2005; Lucas et al.
2006; Mukamel et al. 2007; Mukamel, Weimer, and Mushlin
2006; Rothenberg et al. 2004; Skinner et al. 2005), and minor-
ities are less likely to use higher-volume hospitals and sur-
geons (Bach et al. 2001; Birkmeyer et al. 2002; Birkmeyer
et al. 2003; Dardik et al. 2000; Epstein et al. 2010; Harmon
et al. 1999; Scarborough et al. 2010). These differences per-
sist even after controlling for a variety of other factors
(Epstein et al. 2010; Gray et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2006; Losina
et al. 2007; Neighbors et al. 2007; Trivedi, Sequist, and
Ayanian 2006). Moreover, research results have revealed that
a large portion of the disparities in quality of care for minori-
ties appear to be associated with between-hospital differences
rather than within-hospital differences, that is, racial/ethnic
disparities in quality and outcomes are associated with the
fact that minorities and whites are obtaining care at different
hospitals rather than because they receive different levels of
care within the same hospital (Barnato et al. 2005; Bradley
et al. 2004; Breslin et al. 2009; Gaskin et al. 2008; Goldstein
et al. 2009; Groeneveld et al. 2005; Hausmann et al. 2009;
Joynt, Orav, and Jha 2011).
These findings highlight the need to better understand the
factors that influence where patients receive care, but there
has been relatively little study of the particular pathways that
lead to these disparities. In this article, we examine several
potentially influential factors, which shed new light on how

patients use their local medical delivery systems. Our start-
ing point is the decision-making complexity associated with
hospital use and how patient and physician decisions are
affected by several features of the local hospital environ-
ment, including what we will term proximity, choice com-
plexity, and local medical experience. As we document
below, minority patients in the United States generally live
relatively close to hospitals, but they face a previously unrec-
ognized set of disadvantages associated with the greater
complexity of their hospital markets and their more limited
experience with specialized medical services.
Our empirical analysis focuses on racial/ethnic disparities
associated with one particular marker of hospital quality: the
use of hospitals that are "high volume" providers of surgical
services for which there is evidence that higher-volume hos-
pitals have better outcomes (Dudley et al. 2000; Gandjour,
Bannenberg, and Lauterbach 2003; Halm, Lee, and Chassin
2002; Luft, Bunker, and Enthoven 1979; Shahian and
Normand 2003).1 Based on a large literature, experts have
advised patients to obtain their care from these high-volume
hospitals (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
[AHRQ] 2006; Birkmeyer 2000a, 2000b; Leapfrog Group
2007). A number of issues have been raised on how to act on
these findings (Epstein 2002), and some researchers have
questioned the use of volume as a guide for patient decision
making (Browne, Pietrobon, and Olson 2009; Goshima et al.
2008) and public policy (Glance et al. 2007; Ricciardi et al.
2008). Nonetheless, for our analysis, procedure volume is a
useful marker for examining where racial/ethnic minorities
are treated and how their responses to hospital quality infor-
mation may differ from white patients. For a number of
years, especially in the period we examine, the volume­out-
come relationship in hospitals was publicized in press
accounts of research, and information on hospital volume
became more widely available to consumers. And by the end
of the 1990s, this relationship was recognized by the public:
roughly two-thirds of Americans viewed the extent to which
a hospital is "experienced with a given test or procedure" as
revealing "a lot" about quality of care (Kaiser Family
Foundation [KFF], 2000), and minorities appeared as aware
of this relationship as whites (Gray et al. 2009).
As we show below, although minorities live closer than
whites to these high-volume facilities, they are systemati-
cally less likely to receive care at these hospitals. Minority
group members in the United States face a number of general
and well-known disadvantages, including discrimination,
more limited levels of economic and social resources, and
difficulties in obtaining access to services. Our analysis sug-
gests that greater complexity in the hospital markets where
minorities live creates an additional set of challenges. For
most minority patients, while high-volume hospitals are geo-
graphically accessible, there are often a large number of low-
volume hospitals nearby as well. Drawing from the literature
on decision making and bounded rationality, we hypothesize
that information demands, lower levels of local experience,
more limited physician assistance, and lower levels of trust
make it more difficult for minority patients to navigate the
health care system and identify higher-quality providers.
These difficulties are magnified by the complexity of the
urban hospital markets where most minority group members
live in the United States, and this offsets the advantages of
proximity that minorities should have when obtaining hospi-
tal care.
As we develop below, complex decision-making environ-
ments may affect the observed pattern of hospital use in two
distinct ways: First, white patients may have greater advan-
tages and minority patients greater disadvantages in adapting
to decision-making complexity. And so, white and minority
patients may be observed to be responding differentially,
with lower and higher levels of sensitivity to the decision-
making environment. Second, minorities and whites might
simply be situated in different circumstances, with minorities
living in decision-making environments that are more com-
plex. Decision-making complexity might then have a greater
impact on minority patients, even if for any given level of
complexity, white and minority patients respond similarly to
the level of complexity.
Our empirical contribution uses hospitalization data from
four states. We use these data to describe the magnitude of
racial/ethnic disparities and present a set of multivariate
models that estimate the impacts of proximity, choice com-
plexity, and local medical experience on these patterns of
high-volume hospital use. All three factors play a role and
together are associated with about half of the observed racial/
ethnic disparity in the use of high-volume facilities.
Importantly, our results show that for some, but not all, of the
factors we measure, minorities are differentially responsive
to complexity, at least for several specific services. But for
explaining the impact on the overall level of disparities, the
effects of living in different market circumstances are strong
and consistently found for all services that we examined,
while differential sensitivity is found for only some of the
factors we examine, for only some services, and it is often
only modest in size. Thus, based on these data, the results
indicate that the main choice-related disadvantages for
minority patients are associated with simply living in a com-
plex hospital market context and are largely not because
minority patients respond differently to the various factors
that influence hospital choice.
Hospital Choice: Complex Choice Sets
and Bounded Rationality
Over the last three decades, researchers have explored the
implications of bounded rationality and the decision-making
biases that emerge under conditions of limited information
for a broad range of decisions, including medical decision
making (Diamond and Vartiainen 2007; Frank 2007; Rabin
1998; Simon 1987; Tversky and Kahneman 1974). We draw
on this literature for our conceptual model, which focuses on
Kronebusch et al. 3
how information availability and complexities in the choice
environment affect patient decisions concerning hospital
care. The choice circumstances of white and minority
patients differ in important ways, and these differences cre-
ate a previously unrecognized source of racial/ethnic dispari-
ties in the use of high-volume hospitals.
Our model of hospital choice starts with the general
effects of limited information on decision making. When
making decisions under conditions of limited information,
individuals use a variety of strategies. These include relying
on information derived from social networks (Pauly and
Satterthwaite 1981), and while other sources of information
have emerged, most Americans continue to use experiences
of family and friends rather than expert evaluations when
making medical decisions (KFF 2008). In addition, consum-
ers employ various psychological heuristics and decision-
making rules-of-thumb by, for instance, using examples that
are familiar and that come readily to mind (Tversky and
Kahneman 1973), following similar decisions by others
(Thaler and Sunstein 2008, chap. 3), extrapolating from a
small number of experiences or reports from others (Rabin
2002; Tversky and Kahneman 1971), staying with the status
quo (Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988), and following a sat-
isficing norm (Simon 1987). These strategies allow patients
to make decisions with limited information. At the same
time, these strategies also reduce the incentive to gather
additional information, which further reduces the likelihood
of identifying higher-quality hospitals, and reinforces
patients' tendencies to choose hospitals based on conve-
nience or familiarity.
The difficulty of analyzing medical care options increases
as the number of provider options expands, creating a situa-
tion of potential "choice overload" (Iyengar and Kamenica
2007). Consumers who face choice overload often make
poor decisions, and the presence of additional options may
be overwhelming, leading them to disengage from the pro-
cess (Gilovich and Medvec 1995), refuse to make any deci-
sion at all (Anderson 2003; Iyengar and Lepper 2000), reduce
the number of alternatives under active consideration
(Johnson et al. 1993; Payne, Johnson, and Bettman 1993),
and defer to others who might choose for them, potentially
reinforcing patient deference to their physicians (Frank
2007).
Choice overload will be especially likely in urban areas,
where services are available at multiple institutions. Because
the probability of choice overload increases with the com-
plexity of the choice set, an abundance of hospital options
may impede decision making. This is compounded by inad-
equate information and the resulting use of decision short-
cuts: poorly informed patients will have greater difficulties
identifying higher-quality hospitals and will rely on conve-
nience and local referral patterns that may lead them to
lower-quality hospitals. Moreover, if choice overload causes
patients to disengage psychologically, they become more
likely to rely on familiarity, allow others to guide their
choice, or adopt a satisficing approach, assuming that any
hospital will deliver care of adequate quality. These heuris-
tics will increase the likelihood of using lower-quality hospi-
tals and bypassing higher-quality hospitals.
Implications for Racial/Ethnic
Disparities
The limitations on information availability and the difficul-
ties of navigating complex choice situations are likely to dis-
proportionately affect minorities. Minority patients have
more limited access to informal sources of information and
tend to live in urban areas where decision making is complex
due to the relatively large number of hospitals. These diffi-
culties would be less consequential if patients could simply
defer to their providers, but minorities are also less con-
nected to sources of medical guidance and less trusting of the
medical care system.
First, minority patients have weaker connections to physi-
cians than do whites: they are less likely to have a regular
source of care, are more likely to use clinics or hospital out-
patient departments as their usual source of care, have fewer
outpatient visits than whites, and are less likely to be insured
(Lillie-Blanton, Martinez, and Salganicoff 2001). Second,
even when connected with a primary care clinician, minority
patients face hurdles to obtaining high-quality care, and this
can affect every stage of medical utilization (Einbinder and
Schulman 2000). Physicians who treat minority patients
report greater difficulty obtaining referrals and admissions
(Bach et al. 2004), and minorities are more likely to have
minority physicians, who themselves report greater difficul-
ties in obtaining services (Hargraves, Stoddard, and Trude
2001). Minority patients use surgeons with higher mortality
rates, especially when their primary care physicians have had
more limited experience with the hospitals used (Mukamel,
Weimer, and Mushlin 2006).
Moreover, compared with whites, minority patients have a
lower level of trust toward the health care system, and they are
thus likely to give additional weight to obtaining care from
facilities that are seen as trustworthy. Various forms of dis-
crimination contribute to their lower levels of satisfaction and
perceptions of receiving lower-quality care (Blendon et al.
2008; LaVeist, Nickerson, and Bowie 2000; Lillie-Blanton et
al. 2000). Cultural factors and language create difficulties
(Brach and Fraser 2000), and minority patients who have been
hospitalized report less respect for patient preferences than do
whites (Hicks et al. 2005). Trust may be particularly relevant
for minorities in that the use of high-volume hospitals may
require that they cross social and geographic boundaries to
obtain care from providers located outside their own neighbor-
hoods, or in institutions generally perceived as "white."
In combination, these factors increase the difficulties
that minority patients face in negotiating their way through
the health care system. Under these circumstances, we
hypothesize that they will fall back on various decision
4 INQUIRY
heuristics about where to receive their inpatient care, such
as simply seeking treatment at other nearby hospitals,
which are familiar to patients and their social networks, and
convenient because their current clinicians practice in these
hospitals. The converse is found for white patients--at the
individual, neighborhood, and market levels, white patients
benefit from a number of socio-economic advantages that
facilitate adaptations to this complexity.
Local Experience
As just discussed, patients tend to rely on their social net-
works when making medical decisions. Compared with
whites, patients from minority groups are more reliant on
these informal sources of information than on published
performance measures (Gray et al. 2009). Moreover, minor-
ities have lower average levels of formal education than
whites, which may reduce their ability to obtain and ana-
lyze publicly available information about hospital quality.
As the rate of utilization for any particular procedure varies
by location, there are places where prospective patients will
have a large number of potential informal advisers with
personal experiences, and neighborhoods where these
experiences are more limited. The reliability of this infor-
mal advice is likely to be higher in communities with a rela-
tively high procedure utilization rate compared with
communities with lower rates. But because neighborhoods
with concentrated minorities tend to have below average
income and education levels, and lower rates of insurance
coverage and procedure utilization, the level of experience
in a typical minority patient's social network is likely to be
less than for white patients.
Hypothesis 1: Local experience: Minority patients are
more likely to live in areas with lower utilization rates for
particular services, and because of this, they have less
access to informal advice, and will use high-volume hos-
pitals at a lower rate than whites. Moreover, the various
disadvantages discussed above lead minority patients to
have more limited information from a range of sources. If,
however, they live in areas with higher levels of local
experience, this will partially make up for the relative
paucity of information from other sources, and this will
tend to benefit them disproportionately, leading to a pat-
tern of differential responses to local experience.
Choice Overload
Choice overload is more likely to affect minority patients for
two reasons. First, because minority populations often live in
larger urban areas, they are more likely to face complex
choice sets for inpatient care. Second, because many minor-
ity populations have lower levels of educational attainment,
fewer minority patients will have developed the skills for
dealing with complex choices.
Hypothesis 2: Complex choice sets: The magnitude of
racial disparities in high-volume hospital use will be asso-
ciated with differences in the number of options available
in local markets, and disparities will be most pronounced
among residents who face the most complex choice sets.
Moreover, minority disadvantages will differentially
reduce the ability of minority patients to identify higher-
quality hospitals in areas with complex choice sets.
Proximity and Distance
As we have argued, minorities have more limited access to
relevant information about hospital quality and lower levels of
physician assistance in making hospital decisions, at the same
time that they live in more complex medical markets. One
heuristic that patients might use when it is difficult to collect
and assess information on numerous potential hospitals is to
simply choose any nearby hospital. Although this may not be
optimal as an approach for identifying higher-quality hospi-
tals, it does minimize the need to analyze a complex array of
information. In addition, a patient's physicians are more likely
to practice at nearby hospitals and will be familiar with the
staff and affiliated physicians. Finally, with the lower level of
assistance from physicians, minority patients are relatively
more reliant on their social networks for advice, leading
minority patients to be more likely to act on the basis of famil-
iarity and the hospital experiences of friends, family, and
neighbors--experiences which will be disproportionately
based on care received from nearby hospitals.
Hypothesis 3: Proximity and distance: The locations of
hospitals may create advantages and disadvantages for
particular groups of patients. Minorities disproportion-
ately live in urban areas and are located closer to hospitals
than white patients on average. This should, on average,
increase their use of high-volume hospitals. Proximity
will have a substantial influence on hospital choice for all
patients, and it is likely to have a distinctly strong effect
for minority patients whose choices are less likely to be
aided by physicians. With lower levels of medical guid-
ance, they will be differentially more sensitive to distance
and proximity than white patients.
Data and Methods
Based on the literature on volume and outcomes, we chose
volume-sensitive services with sufficient sample sizes to
provide reliable estimates, including three cardiovascular
procedures, three types of cancer surgery, three orthopedic
procedures, and two prostate procedures.2 The outcome of
interest is whether patients used a hospital that was a high-
volume provider for the specific procedure or condition for
which they were admitted, based on whether the hospital's
average annual discharges (averaged over the two-year
period) met or exceeded evidence-based volume thresholds.
Kronebusch et al. 5
For coronary artery bypass grafts, coronary angioplasty, and
carotid endarterectomy, thresholds recommended by the
Leapfrog Group were used, while for the remaining services,
thresholds were based on the median volume level associ-
ated with better outcomes in the studies reviewed by Halm,
Lee, and Chassin (2002). (The specific thresholds we used
are presented in Table 1.)
We use hospitalization data for residents of Arizona,
Florida, New Jersey, and Wisconsin for eleven surgical pro-
cedures in 2001­2002. These states represent the major
regions of the United States and were chosen to capture the
range of patient demographic characteristics.3 These particu-
lar years are a good period to assess patient responses to
information: over the previous decade, the research literature
identifying the relationship between hospital volume and
quality had grown substantially, significant efforts to inform
the public about hospital quality had begun, and volume
came to be seen as a relevant consideration for patient choice.
The years 2001­2002 thus represent a period when patients
were beginning to act on this information, and there might be
significant racial/ethnic differences in patient responses
based on access to information and the nature of decision-
making complexity.
The data are based on hospital-reported information for
acute care, nonfederal hospitals, collected by state agencies,
and reported to the Health Care Utilization Project (HCUP).
These State Inpatient Data files include all hospitalizations
for nearly all nonfederal hospitals in these states. In addition
to diagnostic and procedure information and patient charac-
teristics, the data include patient zip codes, which were used
to measure proximity to hospitals, and the socio-demo-
graphic characteristics of patients' neighborhoods, based on
zip code tabulation area data obtained from the Bureau of the
Census.
Because of the relatively small number of observations
for less common procedures, we limited the descriptive por-
tion of this analysis to only the four largest racial/ethnic
groups in the United States, coded into mutually exclusive

categories: Hispanic origin (Latino), and the non-Hispanic
racial categories of white, black (African-American), and
Asian/Pacific Islander. Other patient characteristics obtained
from the HCUP data were age, gender, insurance (Medicare,
Medicaid, private insurance, uninsured), whether insurance
involved managed care, whether the admission was a routine
admission (as opposed to an emergency admission), and
whether the patient was transferred from another hospital.
The complexity of the patient's condition was measured by
an index of comorbidities (Elixhauser et al. 1998). We mea-
sured patients' socio-economic backgrounds using Census
2000 data for each patient's zip code, computing average
household income and educational attainment based on the
percentage of residents over age twenty-five who have grad-
uated from high school but not college, and the percent col-
lege graduates.
Other aspects of neighborhoods and geographic location
may be relevant too. To control for patterns of residential
segregation and the geographic concentration of minorities,
we also included the racial/ethnic composition of the zip
code, measured as percent African-American and percent
Latino. There may also be differences between urban, subur-
ban, and rural areas in the access to medical care and com-
munication of medical information. We proxy for these
factors using the level of urbanization, measured by the per-
centages of the zip code population living in rural areas and
in places with a population less than fifty thousand
persons.4
Proximity was measured by the distance to the closest
hospital (regardless of volume) that provides each service,
the distance to the nearest high-volume hospital for that ser-
vice, and a dichotomous variable indicating whether the
closest hospital is also the nearest high-volume hospital.
Distances were calculated using the geographic centroid of
the patient's zip code and each hospital's location as reported
in the 2001 American Hospital Association annual survey.
Because multi-hospital chains often report only a single
headquarters address, and because of limited address infor-
mation on some hospitals, we supplemented this information
with street address information obtained from other sources.
To measure the complexity of patient choices, we deter-
mined the number of hospitals that provide each service
within a 40-mile radius of the patient's zip code, as well as
the number of low-volume hospitals that are closer to the
patient's zip code than the nearest high-volume hospital.5 For
our measure of local medical experience, we calculated a
population-based incidence rate of each procedure using the
number of procedures aggregated to the three-digit zip code
area divided by total population for that area.
Results
The left-hand columns of Table 1 present rates of high-vol-
ume hospital use for the eleven services. Our main disparity
measure is the difference between the fraction
using high-volume hospitals for each minority group and the
fraction for whites, which we present in the center columns.
For patients from all distances, African-Americans have sig-
nificantly lower rates than whites for nine of the eleven ser-
vices, and Latinos have significantly lower rates for six of
the eleven. For Asians, the sample sizes and the differences
from the white rates are smaller, and the pattern is more
mixed.
African-Americans, Latinos, and Asians living in the
United States and in these four study states are more likely
than whites to live in urban areas, and because proximity is
important for hospital utilization, these disparity measures
may be partially misleading. A simple correction for geo-
graphic accessibility is to limit the sample to patients living
within 10 miles of a high-volume hospital (right-hand col-
umns). In general, the observed rates of high-volume hospi-
tal use are higher with this sample restriction, and this is
especially true for whites, as they typically live farther from
high-volume hospitals. Limited to patients with ready geo-
graphic access, much larger racial/ethnic disparities are
observed. For both African-Americans and Latinos, ten of
the eleven services show a significant disparity compared
with whites, with differences ranging between 5 and 23 per-
centage points.And with this sample restriction,Asians show
disparities relative to whites, although these gaps are gener-
ally smaller than for the other two minority groups, and only
four are significant.
To determine whether information availability and deci-
sion complexity are associated with disparities in hospital
use, we focused on six of these services. These services have
sufficiently large sample sizes to support multivariate model-
ing for the largest racial/ethnic groups, although because
sample sizes for Asians are much smaller, we also limited the
rest of this analysis to whites, African-Americans, and
Latinos. Table 2 presents several descriptive measures of
proximity, choice complexity, and local experience which
show important differences for white and minority patients.
The top two sets of lines show that whites' greater usage of
high-volume hospitals is not because these hospitals are
closer: For all six services, whites live farther from high-
volume hospitals than either African-Americans or Latinos.
At the same time, whites may have one decision-making
advantage: although living farther away from hospitals in
general, for whites, the closest hospital is more often a high-
volume hospital.
Importantly for our analysis of choice complexity, the
data indicate that many patients face large choice sets, and
these choice sets are larger for minority patients: white
patients typically live in markets with twenty to twenty-two
hospitals offering the service, while minority patients face
twenty-six to thirty hospitals.6 Less than half of these hospi-
tals are high-volume and for some services, only a small
fraction meets the designated volume thresholds. Moreover,
while there are more high-volume hospitals in market areas
where minorities live, there are typically additional
Kronebusch et al. 7
low-volume hospitals that also provide these services. The
result is that compared with whites, minorities generally face
a choice context that features both a higher number of lower-
volume hospitals that are closer than the nearest high-volume
hospital and a lower chance that the closest hospital is a high-
volume hospital.
Finally, a third aspect of information availability is the
experience embedded in local social networks. As shown in
Table 2, minorities tend to live in areas with lower levels of
this experience-based information availability, as measured
by lower levels of utilization and lower percentages living in
areas with above average utilization rates for the six
services.
Multivariate Modeling
The descriptive statistics suggest that proximity, choice
complexity, and local experience may affect minorities and
whites differently, and might help explain a portion of the
disparities identified in Table 1. To examine these factors
together and to control for other confounding influences, we
estimated a series of linear regressions, modeling the deci-
sion about using high-volume hospitals as a dichotomous
choice.7 In Table 3, we present the key results from these
models.8
We discuss the results in two steps: First, we present the
results for the main effect coefficients--results that apply
to all patients, including minority patients. These main
effect results indicate strong and statistically significant
effects consistent with the approach we outlined above.
As the decision contexts faced by minority patients differ
from those of white patients (see the summary statistics
presented in Table 2), adjusting for these main effects has a
substantial impact on explaining racial/ethnic disparities in
high-volume hospital use, a finding which we will highlight
later in our presentation of Table 4.
We follow this with a discussion that focuses on the coef-
ficients measuring the interactions for race and ethnicity. For

of college graduates, average household income, the percentage of African-Americans, the percentage of Latinos, and the percentages living in rural areas and places with populations of less than 50,000
persons are measured at the five-digit zip code level using the Census 2000 Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) files. For the zip code­level variables, the left-out comparison variables are the percentage
with less than high school education, percentage white, and percentage living in places with 50,000 or more persons. Distances to hospitals, determination of the closest hospital, and the counts of
the number of local hospitals were based on patient zip codes combined with hospital zip code information. Local utilization rates were calculated at the three-digit zip code level for each service and
represent total cases per 1,000 population. The models also include fixed effects for the states (Florida, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Arizona). Because of relatively small sample sizes, patients coded as Asian/
Pacific Islander, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Other race, or unknown race were excluded from the data sets used for these estimates.
aFor each complexity measure, the results include both a main effect coefficient (on the line with a description of the variable), and two coefficients for interactions with African-American and Latino (on
lines with the name of the racial/ethnic group). Non-Hispanic whites are the left-out group.

some procedures and specific minority groups, the interac-
tion results modify the main effects, but except for the level
of local experience and certain aspects of proximity and
complexity, the interaction results generally indicate only a
modest degree of differential responsiveness by minority
group members. The net impacts on use of high-volume hos-
pitals are largely determined by the main effects results in
combination with the substantial differences in the decision-
making context for minorities.
Main effects.The coefficients for the decision making vari-
ables are presented in the lower portion of Table 3.The main
effect coefficients provide evidence that all three factors are
associated with use of high-volume facilities.9 As we pro-
posed in Hypothesis 1, local experience has an impact, with
higher levels of local experience associated with greater use
of high-volume hospitals for all but one service. These coef-
ficients imply that an increased local utilization rate of one
case per thousand would be associated with a 3 to 5 percent-
age point increase in patient use of a high-volume hospital.10
Our second hypothesis concerned choice complexity. The
estimated coefficients for the choice complexity variables
are in the expected negative direction for three of the ser-
vices, although this is combined with positive coefficients
for some services. Consider first the effect of one additional
hospital within 40 miles: such a change alters the probability
of obtaining care at a high-volume hospital by 0.1 to 0.3 per-
centage points. In urban areas with numerous hospitals, the
cumulative effect for these services would be larger: patients
living in an area with ten additional hospitals would have a
reduction in high-volume hospital use of up to 3 percentage
points. Much more important quantitatively are the estimated
impacts of our separate measure of complexity and local hos-
pital diversion: as hypothesized, an additional lower-volume
hospital that is closer than the nearest high-volume hospital
reduces high-volume hospital use--by 5.5 percentage points
for coronary bypasses and 2 to 3 percentage points for carotid
endarterectomy, lung cancer surgery, and total hip replace-
ment. The effects are smaller but still negative for total knee
replacement and open prostatectomy.
Distance to the nearest high-volume hospital has a nega-
tive relationship to high-volume hospital use, and distance to
the closest hospital also affects hospital use. Patients for
whom the closest hospital is a high-volume hospital are more
likely to receive their care at a high-volume hospital. The
coefficients on the distance to the nearest high-volume hos-
pital range from -0.002 to -0.008. To interpret these coeffi-
cients, consider a change in distance of 10 miles: depending
on the service, patients who live an additional 10 miles far-
ther from a high-volume hospital are 2 to 8 percentage points
less likely to receive their care at high-volume hospitals. The
effects of distance to the closest hospital are comparable in
magnitude--a difference of 10 miles alters the use of high-
volume hospitals by 3 to 12 percentage points.11 The dichot-
omous variable indicating that the closest hospital is
high-volume has a large impact, increasing high-volume
hospital use between 12 and 38 percentage points.
Interaction effects.The interactions included in the Table 3
models allow the coefficients for proximity, choice complex-
ity, and local experience to vary across the racial/ethnic
groups, which permits us to test for whether disparities arise
because racial/ethnic minorities are differentially responsive
to complexity compared with white patients, or whether dis-
parities arise because minorities are disproportionately
located in urban hospital markets that feature a higher level
of complexity.
We start by observing that a large portion of the estimated
interactions are not significant­indicating that minority
patients are not clearly behaving differently compared with
whites. These more ambiguous interaction results contrast
quite strongly with the main effects results, for which nearly
all of the estimated coefficients are statistically significant and
large enough to be substantively relevant. For the interactions,
of the seventy-two estimated coefficients (six variables of
interest for two minority groups for six services), slightly less
than half (32 of 72) are significant at the 5-percent level.
Second, the interaction results that are significant and
consistent indicate that African-Americans and Latinos are
comparatively more responsive to local experience than are
whites for several services, as we proposed in our first
hypothesis. In particular, this is the case for coronary artery
bypass and carotid endarterectomy for both African-
Americans and Latinos, and for total knee replacement and
lung cancer surgery for Latinos. For coronary bypass,
carotid endarterectomy, and total knee replacement, the esti-
mated interaction coefficients for the two minority groups
are comparable in magnitude to the estimated main effects,
and thus minorities are shown to be approximately twice as
responsive to local experience as are white patients.12 This
enhanced responsiveness, however, is not shown for the
remaining services. As we argued above, minority patients
suffer from a number of information and choice-related dis-
advantages when seeking specialized care. The results for
our measure of local experience indicate that when they live
in neighborhoods where there is a higher level of experi-
ence, they disproportionately benefit from the experience of
their neighbors.
The presence of a high-volume hospital as the closest hos-
pital increases use of high-volume hospitals by African-
Americans for carotid endarterectomy, lung cancer surgery,
and total knee replacement. We hypothesized that less well-
informed patients will tend to use nearby hospitals, and when
the very closest hospital is also a high-volume hospital, the
result is a greater likelihood of receiving care at a high-vol-
ume facility. But this effect was not found for Latinos--for
two services, Latinos benefited less--suggesting that other
factors besides proximity are affecting Latino hospital use.
The remaining interaction results include coefficients that
are small in magnitude, inconsistent in direction across
12 INQUIRY
minority groups, and generally statistically insignificant.
This is the case for the interaction coefficients for the dis-
tance variables, supporting a conclusion that except for the
proximity effect associated with a nearby high-volume hos-
pital, the effects of distance are similar for white and minor-
ity patients. For the measures of complexity--that is, the
interactions with the number of hospitals and the number of
hospitals closer than the nearest high-volume hospital--
there are a number of significant coefficients. However, the
magnitudes of the estimated interaction effects are often
small. For both measures of complexity, the main effects
dominate the results, again indicating that for these factors,
white and minority patients are not very different from each
other in their responses to choice complexity.
Thus, except for local experience and certain aspects of
proximity and complexity, the results do not indicate a high
level of differential responsiveness, but instead, the general
pattern is that patients of all races and ethnicities are affected
by complexity in a similar way, with differences mostly due
to the market contexts where patients live. We assess this in
Table 4, which reports the results of simulated probability
calculations for each racial/ethnic group using the models we
estimated. The first set of rows in the table provides the
unadjusted probabilities and differences between the racial/
ethnic groups shown in Table 1. The second and third sets of
rows give the results of the simulations.
These simulations used the sample means and the esti-
mated coefficients from the models to calculate the proba-
bilities that would be expected if members of each of the
racial/ethnic groups are assumed to be living in "average"
market circumstances. For the second set, we use the over-
all sample averages and the coefficients from a simplified
model that estimates only main effects coefficients for our
key variables of interest and coefficients for the control
variables included in the models. For the third set of results,
we use the interacted models presented in Table 3 that
include racial/ethnic interactions with those key variables.
Comparing the first and second sets of predicted probabili-
ties shows the effects of our basic model, while the differ-
ences between the second and third sets of probabilities
reveal the additional effects of incorporating the interaction
coefficients into the model.
Compared with the unadjusted probabilities, the full
model (third set of lines) reduces the disparity gaps substan-
tially: For African-Americans, the unadjusted gap of 7 to 18
percentage points across the range of services is reduced to 5
to 9 percentage points; for Latinos, the unadjusted gap of 5 to
26 percentage points is reduced to 0 to 17 percentage points.
Across the six services, the mean unadjusted disparity gap is
13 percentage points for African-Americans and about 14
percentage points for Latinos. The full model reduces this to
6.3 to 6.8 percentage points. For five of the six services--all
except open prostatectomy--the gap is reduced by at least
one-third, and for several services, the adjustment reduces
the disparity gap by more than half of the unadjusted gap.
However, comparing the second and third sets of results
shows that most of this gain is achieved by a model that uses
the main effects for our key variables, and that adding racial/
ethnic interactions only modestly improves the level of
explanation. For example, for total knee replacement, the
unadjusted differences are 15.4 percentage points for
African-Americans compared with whites, and 15.2 percent-
age points for Latinos versus whites. Using our main effects
model, the predicted rate of high-volume hospital use for
minority patients rises, and the differences with whites
decline: to 8.5 percentage points for African-Americans and
10.4 percentage points for Latinos. Adding the interactions
in the final model reduces these differences to 6.1 and 9.7
percentage points, only moderately different from the differ-
ences that result from using the predicted probabilities of the
main effects model. Averaging across the six services, the
main effects models for both African-Americans and Latinos
reduce the apparent disparity with whites by about 6.6 to 7.3
percentage points for these services. On average, the models
with the additional racial/ethnic interactions reduce this fur-
ther by only 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points.
Impact of Complexity
The multivariate results show that, at least for decisions to
use high-volume hospitals, there are impacts associated with
the presence of nearby, low-volume hospitals, which divert
patients away from high-volume hospitals. To provide a
more intuitive appreciation of this, we present the rates of
high-volume hospital use for patients living in different
choice contexts. In Table 5, patients are stratified based on
the number of hospitals closer than the nearest high-volume
hospital. As the number of additional nearby hospitals
increases, use of a high-volume hospital declines--an effect
that occurs for all racial/ethnic groups. For example, 87 per-
cent of white patients use a high-volume hospital for coro-
nary bypass if there are no low-volume hospitals closer than
the nearest high-volume hospital, but this falls to 59 percent
if there is one low-volume hospital that is closer. Similarly,
the rates for African-Americans and Latinos fall from 78 to
79 percent to 49 to 54 percent. For nearly all of the combina-
tions of services and hospital contexts shown in the table, the
reduction in high-volume hospital use associated with sim-
ply adding a nearby low-volume hospital is larger than the
size of the disparity gap between whites and minorities.
Importantly, the results in Table 5 show that while this
effect occurs for all racial/ethnic groups, it is larger for
African-Americans and Latinos than for whites, so racial/
ethnic disparities in the use of high-volume hospitals grow as
this form of complexity increases. Moreover, because minor-
ities are more likely to live in areas that feature a larger num-
ber of nearby low-volume hospitals (see Table 2), they will
be disproportionately located in the hospital choice contexts
defined by the lower lines of the table. The combined effects

more complex market contexts increase overall racial/ethnic
disparities in high-volume hospital use.
Limited Connectedness, Trust, and Decisions to
Bypass Hospitals
As we argued above, minorities have more limited connec-
tions to physicians, a lower level of trust in the health care
system, and more limited access to guidance and informa-
tion. Because of this, they may be especially interested in
receiving care at familiar institutions. These are not neces-
sarily the closest facilities, and this leads us to one additional
observation based on these data.
In general, it would be expected that more familiar institu-
tions will include those that are geographically closest to
patients. But the institutions that patients or their social cir-
cles are familiar with in a particular area may also be slightly
farther away, especially in urban areas where there are a
number of hospitals within a relatively short distance. Indeed,
familiarity may lead patients to use hospitals that appear to
be less conveniently located than the nearest high-volume
hospital, and this may account for surprising differences in
the patterns of minority hospital use compared with that
observed for white patients.
In Table 6, we separate patients into two groups, based on
whether the closest hospital providing the service is a high-
or low-volume hospital. For the most part, when the closest
hospital exceeds the volume threshold, minorities and whites
are similar in their use of this facility, although for coronary
bypasses, modest differences do seem to exist.
More striking and persistent racial/ethnic differences
emerge among those who use a hospital that is more distant
than the nearest high-volume hospital. White patients who
do this are far more likely (for five of the six procedures) to
use another high-volume hospital. Similarly, when the clos-
est hospital is a low-volume hospital, for all six services,
whites are more likely than minorities to bypass this hospital
in favor of a high-volume hospital. In contrast, whenAfrican-
Americans and Latinos bypass the closest, high-volume hos-
pital, they disproportionately receive care at a low-volume
hospital. Similarly, when they bypass a low-volume hospital,
they are also more likely to receive care at another low-vol-
ume hospital. Thus, for both forms of bypass, a dispropor-
tionate share of minorities who do not use the closest hospital
ultimately receive care in lower-volume hospitals, while
whites who engage in bypass are more likely to obtain care at
a high-volume hospital.
Limitations
We note several limitations for this analysis. First, we used
data from only four states for 2001­2002. These states were
selected based on the availability of patient zip code infor-
mation essential for our analysis and to capture the range of
racial/ethnic groups in the United States. These states are
broadly similar to the nation as a whole, but our data are not
a nationally representative sample. At this point, we do not
have information that disparities in high-volume hospital use
have changed over time, but starting around 2008, critiques
of the volume­outcome literature began to emerge, and this
has the potential for altering patient and provider decision
making. It is not clear that this would alter our analysis of the
impacts of complexity on hospital decisions for minority
patients, but additional analyses that examine more recent
time periods and different locations will enhance our under-
standing of how patients use hospitals, and racial/ethnic dif-
ferences in those decisions.
Second, the data available for our regression models
allowed us to control for a broad range of patient-level char-
acteristics that may affect hospital use, but these data do not
include individual or family income or individual-level edu-
cational attainment. We constructed proxy measures for
these characteristics using zip code­level income and educa-
tion, but these are not perfect measures of individual patient
characteristics. We also control for the racial/ethnic compo-
sition of patient neighborhoods, and level of urbanization,
but it is possible that there are also other neighborhood and
community-level character-istics that affect hospital use.
Third, because our data are based on hospital discharge
records, we do not have information about patient percep-
tions about hospitals, the medical care that may have pre-
ceded the hospitalization, and the knowledge and perceptions
of their physicians. We also are assuming that the count of
number of patients receiving a particular service is an accu-
rate measure of volume, and we lack other potential mea-
sures of the quality of care beyond measured volume. It is
possible that there are unmeasured aspects of quality that we
fail to observe because of our use of volume as a proxy for
quality. We also are unable to observe details about the
administration of health insurance. Compared with whites,
racial/ethnic minorities may be more likely to obtain insur-
ance through managed care plans, and the plans that minori-
ties join may impose relatively greater restrictions on
utilization and on access to specialists and hospitals than the
plans that serve white patients. Unfortunately, we lack infor-
mation on all of these issues, which limits somewhat our
understanding of why patients of different racial and ethnic
groups use the hospitals that they do.
Our results also indicated some differences by racial/eth-
nic group that we are unable to explain. The economic and
social circumstances of each racial/ethnic group differ, and
factors other than information and decision complexity
undoubtedly contribute to what sources of medical care are
used. One difficulty, however, is that there are more limited
sample sizes for racial/ethnic minorities, reducing our ability
to estimate precisely group differences.
Finally, it should be noted that the market complexity
associated with multiple competing hospitals presents not
just an information challenge for patients and the profes-
sionals who serve these patients. The existence of multiple

hospitals and the referral patterns that emerge among pri-
mary care providers, specialists, and hospitals in these mar-
kets may also lead to segmentation of an area's medical
market and potentially the emergence of de facto segrega-
tion of care that may disadvantage racial/ethnic minorities.
Future analyses should examine how race and ethnicity
interact with historical limitations in access to care, neigh-
borhood residential segregation, provider referral patterns,
and hospital market segmentation. These analyses will be
helpful for understanding the full range of factors that affect
medical care for minority patients and will assist in design-
ing interventions that will enhance patient choices even in
the context of complexity and existing patterns of hospital
use.
Discussion
These results show that racial/ethnic disparities in the use of
high-volume hospitals are common. Our analysis highlights
several ways that the decision-making complexity faced by
minority patients is associated with lower use of high-vol-
ume hospitals. Our results show that patients of all racial/
ethnic groups are affected by decision-making complexity,
but minorities face greater levels of complexity: African-
Americans and Latinos differ from whites with respect to the
volume status of their closest hospitals, the degree of choice
complexity in their areas, and the extent of local experience
with specialized services.
As a result, minorities are less well situated than white
patients. Although they live closer than whites to high-vol-
ume hospitals on average, minorities live in areas with rela-
tively limited local experience with specialized hospital
services, are more likely to reside in places that have multi-
ple, competing hospitals, and are less likely have a high-vol-
ume hospital as their geographically closest hospital. These
differences are associated with significant reductions in their
use of high-volume hospitals, and these differences persist
even after controlling for a wide range of individual-level
demographic and economic characteristics, as well as neigh-
borhood characteristics including income, education, urban-
ization, and racial/ethnic residential patterns.
Minorities appear to be somewhat more sensitive to the
effects of local experience and proximity. But for the most
part, our results indicate that minority patients are generally
not very different from whites in their responses to complex-
ity. Importantly, even when the degree of responsiveness is
similar, minority patients tend to live in market circum-
stances where they face higher levels of complexity and
lower levels of local experience than are typical for white
patients. These differences in circumstances affect the likeli-
hood of receiving care at high-volume hospitals.
Our results are consistent with the expected behavior of
patients with limited connections to sources of medical advice
who, as a result, are less able to act on quality differences
among hospitals. As we hypothesized, overall cognitive
complexity does have an effect, but these effects are much
smaller in magnitude than the diversionary effects associated
with the presence of alternative nearby hospitals. And so, the
decision-making complexity that is most prominent is not the
existence of numerous hospitals and "choice overload" per
se, but the particular difficulties that arise when there are a
number of low-volume hospitals nearby. For the goal of
encouraging patients, especially minority patients, to use
higher-volume hospitals, optimal patient decision making
may require that they, in effect, adopt new decision heuristics
to shift their attention away from more familiar, but low-vol-
ume hospitals, in favor of higher-volume hospitals that are
typically geographically accessible as well.
We cannot provide here a full analysis of potential policy
interventions that might facilitate such a change, nor can we
discuss all of the potential trade-offs that might be raised
about potential interventions. But given the importance of
these disparities, it may be helpful to comment on a few pos-
sible policy implications of our results.
These results reveal one negative consequence of hospital
market competition: the existence of multiple, nearby hospi-
tals that provide specialized services tends to reduce the
overall use of high-volume hospitals, and this effect is par-
ticularly important for minorities living in urban hospital
markets. Market competition may have other beneficial
effects, giving hospitals, under certain conditions, an incen-
tive to reduce costs, improve quality, and to serve additional
patients. But patients in general and minorities in particular
might benefit from a reduction in the number of low-volume
providers of volume-sensitive services. To the extent that
volume is causally related to quality, efforts to consolidate
volume-sensitive services at particular hospitals would
improve the quality of medical care. And from the standpoint
of decision making and cognitive overload, fewer hospitals
providing a service would reduce the complexity of the
choice situation and the possibility that patients and their
referring physicians would choose a relatively low-volume
hospital.
The results for local experience suggest that a higher level
of information within a community is beneficial for patient
decision making in general, and additional local experience
often has an especially large benefit for minority patients,
which we argue is due to their more limited access to infor-
mation and sources of medical advice. This in turn implies
that efforts to disseminate information about quality differ-
ences and to improve connections with providers might lead
to better decisions. In recent years, there has been consider-
able interest in using web-based sources and computer tech-
nology to enhance the level of information available to
patients and their physicians. While it has the theoretical
potential for improving decision making, when there is deci-
sion-making complexity, additional information may not
have this effect, and if patients differ in how well they can act
on it, greater information may even aggravate racial/ethnic
disparities and other disparities associated with income and
Kronebusch et al. 17
education. From the standpoint of reducing racial/ethnic dis-
parities in hospital use, it is important that the information be
tailored to address the choice complexities faced by minori-
ties and that steps be taken to improve the connectedness of
minority patients to high-quality physicians and specialists
to facilitate decision making about hospital care. Without
taking account of these issues, simply introducing additional
consumer information using new technology may not achieve
the desired improvement in minority health care.
As others have suggested (Bach et al. 2004; Jha et al.
2007), it is also possible that quality-improvement interven-
tions could be focused on the hospitals that minority patients
already use, thereby reducing the need for patients to under-
stand hospital quality variations and to incur the costs and
difficulties of choosing among multiple competing hospitals.
Given the decision-making challenges involved in the choice
of hospitals, it may be unrealistic to expect that simply pro-
viding additional quality-related information about hospitals
will alter patients' hospital choices to any substantial degree,
particularly for procedures about which they may have little
or no previous experience. But quality improvement efforts
can still enhance many aspects of quality at these hospitals
and can lead to better patient outcomes. Implementing these
approaches is particularly important in the subset of hospi-
tals that are disproportionately used by minority patients.
Finally, anything that might shift the decision heuristics
currently used by patients and referring physicians could
have significant social benefits, especially for minority
patients who face the disadvantages of a more complex
choice context and more limited connectedness to medical
advice. Our results show that a significant fraction of minor-
ity patients are actually bypassing high-volume hospitals in
favor of lower-volume hospitals that are located farther
away. Any intervention that would reduce the number of
minority patients who bypass high-volume hospitals would
have a measurable effect on the overall use of high-volume
hospitals for minorities. As one example of bypassing behav-
ior, consider coronary artery bypass surgery. If the rate at
which African-American patients bypass a high-volume hos-
pital in favor of a more distant lower-volume hospital could
be altered, this by itself could increase the rate of high-vol-
ume hospital use by African-Americans by 3 to 8 percentage
points.13 As the overall disparity between blacks and whites
for this service is 14.5 percentage points, even a modest
change of 3 to 8 percentage points would represent an impor-
tant reduction in the current disparity gap. One potential
decision heuristic for patients and physicians would be to
determine whether the nearest hospital is a high-volume hos-
pital for a particular service, and if so, to simply use that
hospital rather than some other nearby hospital. Widespread
adoption of this heuristic would simultaneously improve
patient outcomes, increase convenience, and reduce decision
complexity. It is not clear, however, what kind of interven-
tion would alter patient and physician decision making to
accomplish this.
Decision-making complexity and the market environment
are clearly not the only factors important for understanding
racial/ethnic disparities. Minority groups in the United States
continue to suffer from the effects of discrimination, de facto
segregation in housing and access to services, and a wide
range of economic and social disadvantages. To this, our con-
tribution is to add the finding that the medical market context
for minorities differs as well. Those areas feature multiple,
competing hospitals, and complex physician and hospital
referral patterns. Interventions designed to enhance patient
decision making and efforts to ameliorate racial/ethnic dis-
parities will need to give explicit attention to these local hos-
pital environments, the potential racial/ethnic segmentation
of the market, the nature of patient connectedness to the med-
ical care system, and the information demands of this com-
plexity. For minority patients, the complexity of these
environments compounds the more general disadvantages
they face, including more limited access to services and more
limited levels of economic and social resources, and contrib-
utes to the persistence of racial and ethnic inequalities.

Notes
 1. This literature developed over an extended period and acceler-
ated during the 1990s. Halm's 2002 literature review revealed
four articles published in the years 1980 to 1985 and one arti-
cle published between 1986 and 1989, followed by fourteen
articles published in the years 1990 through 1994, fifty-seven
articles published between 1995 and 2000, and one additional
article published in 2002 (Halm, Lee, and Chassin 2002).
2. The samples consist of patients age eighteen or older who
received each named procedure. Detailed coding information
is available from the authors.
 3. Taken together, these four states had a 2002 population of 36.1
million, representing 12.5 percent of the total U.S. population.
The racial/ethnic composition of these four states combined is
comparable with the United States as a whole: In these four
18 INQUIRY
states, the 2002 population distribution is non-Hispanic white
(67.5 percent), black (11.9 percent), Hispanic (16.3 percent),
Asian (3.0 percent), and American Indian (1.2 percent), while
for the United States, the distribution is non-Hispanic white
(68.3 percent), black (12.7 percent), Hispanic (13.4 percent),
Asian (4.0 percent), and American Indian (1.0 percent). These
states represent 12.5 percent of hospital beds and 13.0 percent
of total patients in the United States, more or less equal to
their population share. Based on nationwide data from the year
2000 Census, and the Census Bureau's definition of "urban
area"--living in places with greater than fifty thousand per-
sons--63.7 percent of whites are classified as living in urban
areas, compared with 81.1 percent of African-Americans, 84.4
percent of Latinos, and 93.5 percent of Asians. For the four
states used in this study, the comparable percentages are 78.1
percent, 90.1 percent, 89.2 percent, and 94.8 percent.
4. The left-out categories are the percentage of non-Hispanic
white and the percentage living in urban places (population
greater than 50,000 persons). We thank the journal's reviewers
for suggesting these additional control variables.
5. Although many patients use hospitals that are nearby, some
patients travel much farther. The 40-mile radius was chosen to
capture most of the hospitals that patients might use.
 6. For coronary artery bypass, there are fewer hospitals in gen-
eral, although there remains a difference between whites and
minorities: about eight hospitals for whites, and a range of ten
to twelve hospitals for minorities.
 7. We are using the term choice as it is conventionally used in the
econometrics literature, as an indicator of the hospital actually
used. In practice, the decision may be made by the patient, the
patient's physician(s), or jointly, and may reflect constraints
imposed by insurers and hospitals themselves. Moreover,
while patients may actively select their physicians, the hospital
they use may simply follow from the choice of what physician
was seen in the first place.
 8. As indicated in the table, the models control at the individual
level for age, gender, comorbidities, whether the admission
was routine (as opposed to emergency), whether it represented
a transfer, the source of payment (Medicare, Medicaid, private
insurance, uninsured), whether the insurance involved man-
aged care, and at the zip code level, the percentage of high
school graduates, the percentage of college graduates, aver-
age household income, the percentage of African-Americans,
the percentage of Latinos, and the percentages living in rural
areas and places with populations of less than fifty thousand
persons. For the zip code­level variables, the left-out com-
parison variables are the percentage with less than high school
education, percentage white, and percentage living in places
with fifty thousand or more persons. The models also include
dichotomous variables for each state (Florida, New Jersey,
Wisconsin, Arizona). Patients coded as Asian/Pacific Islander,
American Indians/Alaska Natives, Other race, or unknown
race were excluded from these models.
 9. We present linear regressions for ease of interpretation. Results
using a logit specification are similar.
10. The coefficient for lung cancer surgery appears to be consider-
ably higher than the other services, but this is largely an artifact
of the scale of the explanatory variable. For most of the ser-
vices, the population utilization rates are in the range of one to
three cases per thousand population. For lung cancer surgery,
however, the baseline utilization rate is considerably lower--
three to four cases per ten thousand population. As a result, a
unit change of one case per thousand for lung cancer surgery
represents a much larger change relative to the baseline.
11. The coefficients for the distance to the nearest high-volume
hospital have the expected negative sign, and the coefficients
on the distance to the closest hospital have the expected posi-
tive signs. The latter result may not feel intuitive, but this is
the expected direction. The closest hospital is often a lower-
volume hospital, so increasing this distance reduces the poten-
tial advantages of this hospital and as a result, patients become
more likely to use a high-volume hospital.
12. For lung cancer surgery, the estimated interaction coefficient
for Latinos is much larger than for the other services and
should be interpreted cautiously. The underlying utilization
rates for lung cancer surgery is around 0.3 cases per thousand
population, compared with the more typical rates of one to
three cases per thousand population for most of the other ser-
vices. By itself, this will alter the expected scale for the result-
ing coefficient even if the impact of local experience is similar.
Moreover, the sample size for minorities is more limited for
relatively less common services: there are only 617 Latino
and 540 African-American patients in our lung cancer surgery
sample, compared with 9,194 whites.
13. Lowering the black rate to that of whites would represent a
change of 8 percentage points (from 21 percent to 13 percent)
in the proportion that bypass the closest high-volume hospital
and use a low-volume hospital. As 37 percent of blacks live
in places where the closest hospital is high-volume, the 8­per-
centage point change would by itself lead to a rise of 3 percent-
age points (.08 × .37 = .0296) in the overall rate of high-volume
hospital use. If policy could be even more effective, eliminating
this form of bypass entirely, the change would be 21 percentage
points, and this would raise overall high-volume hospital use
by nearly 8 percentage points (.21 × .37 = .077).
