Communication, Advertising, and
Symbolic Systems
This article aims to analyze some aspects of the woman's
image in advertising. It seeks to understand the logic by
which ads elaborate an image of the feminine identity and,
while in this process, transform the woman into a silent and
fragmented body. Certainly, the "woman," like other repre-
sentations in advertisements, has by definition the duty to
make sales of products and services possible. For that reason,
every ad needs to maintain a constant and intense dialogue
with society, making a very particular cut of the innumerable
possibilities opened by the social experiences available.
Therefore, it is fundamental to thoroughly analyze this mate-
rial as a way of understanding how an ideological pattern of
contemporary culture classifies differences between social
groups through consumption. Hence, in this article, I explore
the anthropological tradition of symbolic systems analysis,
and with it contribute to the debate concerning social repre-
sentations in mass communication in general and, particu-
larly, in advertising.
The themes here approached--mass communication,
social identity, advertising, and culture--are complex, broad,
and multifaceted. Their profound discussion surpasses the
limits to this article. Thus, they neither shall be subject to an
exhaustive investigation, nor it is intended to explore the
many possibilities they unfold. However, it is important to
refer to the issue that relates directly to this article of wom-
en's representations in the media and their ideological conse-
quences. Many authors have focused on discussing the
feminist perspective, the politics and the power involving
the idealization of the woman, the uses of the female body
image for consumption purposes, cultural aspects of gender
role portrayals, and the reproduction of the traditional male
superiority model in mass communication (Bordo, 1993;
De Grazia & Furlough, 1996; Frith, Shaw, & Cheng, 2005;
Kuhn, 1985; Sneeringer, 2004; Wiles, Wiles, & Tjernlund,
1995). Kates and Shaw-Garlock (1999) examined ads in
female magazines to analyze some of the ideological repre-
sentations of women, whereas Lynn, Hardin, and Walsdorf
(2004) investigated photographs of women in sports publica-
tions, suggesting a maintained support to sexual difference
that would serve capitalist hegemony. Also, Kilbourne
(2000) studied the impact of ads that target young female
consumers, indicating that advertising may create a kind of
addictive effect that persuades women to recurrent consump-
tion practices as a path for fulfilling their dreams. In this
respect, Banet-Weiser and Portwood-Stacer (2006) pointed
to the construction of a postfeminist consumer that embarks
in a project of self-actualization through cosmetic surgeries
and diverse beauty treatments, emphasizing ideas of personal
choice and individualization, instead of original feminist
causes of social change and liberation. Goffman (1977), in
his classic study, discussed the ritualization of femininity
showing that the analysis of advertising may reveal represen-
tations of the woman as kind, docile, and playful, construct-
ing her identity with numerous values and labels such as
"submissive," "hidden," "distanced," "toy," "childish,"
"funny," "sweet," and "happy." Moreover, a fundamental

The Woman in Pieces: Advertising and
the Construction of Feminine Identity
Everardo Rocha1
Abstract
This article aims to analyze the representation of the feminine identity in advertising. It explores the notion of social identity
as a category that is experienced in the tension between classification and value. It also discusses the logic by which ads
elaborate an image and, while in this process, transform the woman into a silent and fragmented body. In this article, I
follow the anthropological tradition of symbolic systems analysis, and with it contribute to the debate concerning social
representations throughout mass communication in general and, particularly, in advertising.

meaning of the woman is given when opposed to the world
of men, classifying the feminine identity in a subordinate
hierarchical place. The author explains how advertising fre-
quently portrays the woman in a passive or assistant position,
while the man often symbolizes a superior status and is pic-
tured in a protective attitude, according to the social environ-
ment (familial, professional, or affective) where he interacts
with other participants.
Bearing all of these ideas in mind, this study should be
seen as part of the tradition of studies on the woman's image
in the media and an interpretation to a concrete case of adver-
tising construction of the feminine identity in Brazil. Its goal
is to indicate that anthropology has a distinctive way of anal-
ysis that is an important contribution for the dialogue that
should characterize research over the immense repertoire of
images, identities, representations, symbolisms, and classi-
fying systems available throughout that what we call cultural
industry. In general, we believe that everything in the world
of media changes rapidly. Advertising always seems so con-
temporary, modern, new and bold or, at least, in line with the
latest cultural trend (whatever that may be). We see it as a
kind of radar that captures what is up to date, always pretend-
ing to indicate social changes. However, things are not
always what they seem. Indeed, under a certain plan of
observation, advertising images do identify the change.
Nevertheless, when observed in another plan, we see an
impressive recurrence between the meanings of such images
in various moments. In other words, the representations and
images--of the woman, of the man, of the child, of the fam-
ily, and so forth--change without changing. Even though ads
always tend to seem new in form and in style, a careful com-
parison unveils an amazing similarity between their struc-
tural plans. This indicates that they seem to be in what
Lévi-Strauss (1970) called totemic temporality--cyclic,
nonlinear, a kind of "time" that bets on permanency and is
parted from the historical order. Something like the manner
of myths reproduces the logic by which ads are made (Rocha,
2006, 2010, 2012). As we will see ahead, the woman's repre-
sentations in ads of the 1980' in Brazil reveal themselves to
be most near to today's, composing a central axis of the col-
lective imaginary concerning the feminine identity. Thus, to
study advertisements is to perceive in them the recurrence. It
is a way to see renewed eternal images that express a cyclic
and totemic time. For example, Rocha and Pereira (2013)
examined ads from 1960 through 2012, demonstrating this
recurrent, cyclic, and totemic time in representations of
youth in campaigns for a typical Brazilian soft drink called
"Guaraná." This temporality is an important issue to under-
stand advertising as a speech that classifies products and
people through consumption.
Actually, the questions that advertising presents to thought
are an interesting challenge for their diversity and complex-
ity. The representations and images that inhabit our imagi-
nary form a kind of "script" which we enact in the daily
experience. The anthropological perspective may serve as a
privileged form of interpretation of the universe of images,
ideas, and meanings that are produced by the cultural indus-
try (Rocha, 2006, 2010, 2012). There is a great potential for
intellectual work in following this path of study, especially
when we think of the media as one of the most active voices
occupying public spaces in contemporary culture. Its mes-
sages perform a drama where meanings are made public,
where consensus is imposed and ideologies spread.
The cultural industry places society before an extensive
repertoire of ideas, emotions, feelings, sensations, choices,
impositions, and practices.Acomplex ideological universe is
formed by representations of that society which are then con-
structed, repeated, and transformed through their everyday
dissemination in texts and images of advertisements, news-
papers, soap operas, magazines, news broadcast, movies,
web sites, and so on. These representations are like a system-
atic speech and, from the social actor's point of view, a
speech as comfortable as it is inevitable. However, this ideo-
logical universe transmitted by mass communication always
has consumption as purpose and as a way of self-mainte-
nance. Without consumption, the media system is unfeasible.
The commitment to consumption--of products, services,
ideas, tastes, and feelings--calls for the use of a common
language to the public, because the media only makes sense
in the audience. To be comprehended is a matter of mainte-
nance. Media representations are not unilateral creation, but
an exercise over a concrete relationship between speech and
audience through a common code. Each product of the media
is a bridge that establishes and fixes itself with the thoughts
and practices of the respective consumer markets.
The relationship between society and cultural industry
can be seen as a mirror where the image doubles in countless
rebounds. The important thing is that whatever the precise
form of that relationship, the meanings produced by the
media are public, shared and collective, which makes it dif-
ficult, for example, for someone not to understand an adver-
tisement, radio news, television program, or newspaper
photo. This indicates that the study of meanings propagated
throughout these materials serves as clue toward the existing
models, desires, and dilemmas of a culture. The cultural
industry raises interest because of the keys it holds within
that open passages to the imaginary of the society that pro-
duces it. In this sense, I propose to investigate the most evi-
dent traces of what ads show as the feminine identity. More
specifically, I suggest observing how the woman's image in
advertising presents a fragmented body and a silent being so
that products may "speak" for her.
It is important to understand that in advertisements the
feelings that are expressed, the privacy that is shown and the
intimacy that is exposed are no longer individual characteris-
tics, but, as publicly exhibited, become collective representa-
tions. In Durkheim's (1970) sense, they are social
representations. A "thing" that is coercive, extensive, and
external to the individual. The identities, both of the "man"
and of the "woman," once translated by the media, turn into
Rocha 3
codes or patterns where society sees ideas, styles, and prac-
tices. In this sense, the identities are not dimensions of the
individual, hovering over social, for, when transformed into
media images, they no longer are a "judgment of one's con-
science," but a collective classification constituted through
likewise social values. The feminine identity drawn in ads
does not care for inner selves, subjective characters or mul-
tiple faces of the psychological universe. The ad does not
speak of the difference between individuals or of the singu-
larity, because selling is betting on the far-reaching and
group discourse, classifying everything that is possible as a
consumer public. Advertisements speak of products and ser-
vices to reach consumers. They are generic to the extent of
their markets. The media communicates through what we
have in common: collective representations and social
classifications.
Thus, I wish to retain two basic points. The first is that this
study, paraphrasing Clifford Geertz (1978), is not "about"
the cultural industry, but "in" the cultural industry and, par-
ticularly, in advertisements, assuming the symbolic material
they propagate necessarily has an intense relation with soci-
ety. Ads must dialogue with receivers, they cannot be strang-
ers, or detached. These materials must fit in to the lives of
consumers. The second point is that the identity is inclusive.
It is something that encompasses the individual, and annuls
its subjective and psychological dimensions. We shall look at
it as a social fact, codified in the media as a behavior model,
defining "what it is," "what it can" or "what it should be" in
the feminine world, as a cultural experience and a collective
identity.
Next, I approach the ideas of classification and value as a
way of thinking about social identities. The study follows
with a discussion on the relationship between advertising,
totemism, and consumption, showing how ads trigger a clas-
sification system that is central to modern life. Afterword,
there will be a brief explanation about the methodology and
the Brazilian political redemocratization context that sug-
gests some important ideas to understand the feminine iden-
tity as projected by the ads of the 1980s. Finally, I will look
to capture certain meanings of the body and its fragmentation
as essential axes in the construction of the woman's image
and a mechanism for promoting products and services in
Brazil. As we are going to see, the fragmentation of the
woman's body is an interesting advertising strategy to create
possibilities, spaces, and markets for different brands that
entitle themselves as owners of each one of these pieces, set-
tling specific territories for their various consumer goods.
Identity, Classification, and Value
Ideas like identity, person, character, mask, or role can be
related to the debate over performance or enactment in
everyday life. These are terms that refer to traditional socio-
logical subjects--such as interaction, group, power, social
organization, and so on--besides involving several complex
theories of the Social Sciences. Nonetheless, the concept of
social role is among the most ordinary ideas to speak of soci-
ety. It appears in common sense through familiar expres-
sions, such as the "role of the fool," "fulfill your role," or
"role model," and even in refined speeches that define proper
roles, its attributes and functions. Similarly, the idea of "sta-
tus," somewhat close to the idea of role, has its popularity,
and both deserve a deep study, a true archaeology of struc-
tures and contexts by which different authors considered
them.
A profound study about these concepts would have cer-
tainly related to theater as a privileged metaphor. In Ralph
Daherendorf's famous book Homo Sociologicus, a classic on
the investigation of social roles, the theater theme is clearly
presented:
People, person, character and mask are words that, while
originated from different stages of linguistic development, share
a common area of meaning: the theatre. In drama, for example,
we speak of people or characters whose roles are played by the
actor. And, although he no longer uses the mask, this word too
has the same origin.1 (Dahrendorf, 1969, p. 43)
The theater metaphor is also found in Goffman's "drama-
turgical perspective." In an interesting scheme described in
The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, Goffman (1975)
explained that the "self" acts projecting his characters toward
characters projected by other "selves" that are as well the
audience. A third word from the theater, the audience is, in
everyday life, formed by those who watch the performance
of the "self." All that is said right in the preface, where the
importance of the theater metaphor is emphasized, as the
author assumes the theatrical representation as the main per-
spective used to develop his interpretation of the self in
everyday life.
Back to Dahrendorf, it is clear how the idea of theater was
explored in Homo Sociologicus. The text begins showing the
idea of theatrum mundi as one of the first metaphors used in
this sense. The human world is like an immense theatrical
drama and all living individuals play a single role. Next,
Dahrendorf uses the famous line of Jacques--a Shakespeare
character from the comedy "As you like it"--as an example
of a new vision regarding social role. Jacques explains, "All
the world's a stage and all the men and women merely play-
ers." In this vision, there is no longer a single role for each
human being, but roles that succeed each other in time. One
after another--"His acts being seven ages"--in a sequence
that ends only with death. The point is that each different age
described in Shakespeare's play is also related to profes-
sional roles, such as student, soldier, and judge. Each profes-
sional role, in a certain sense, defines an individual in a
proper age to occupy it (Dahrendorf, 1969, p. 47).
From human life as a single role--theatrum mundi--to a
sequence of roles during a lifetime--"His acts being seven
ages"--until, finally, we come to the idea of multiple and
non excluding roles that each of us is supposed to play. The
4 SAGE Open
multiple roles that individuals may carry and how they may
activate each and every one of them in different moments. It
is toward this idea that converges a great deal of the social
role debate. Dahrendorf (1969) created a famous example of
a situation where a certain Dr. Hans Schmidt, unknown until
this moment, is introduced in a meeting. Once better
acquainted and after gathering information about him, we
come to acknowledge that there is only one Hans Schmidt,
although he is engaged in many different positions and social
roles: adult, man, married, citizen, of German nationality,
father, professor, and so on. This example shows how the
individual's indissolubility is a central thought concerning
social identity. Dahrendorf explains the "homo sociologicus"
as the tension and the intersection between the individual and
the society. The individual is constituted by preestablished
roles, which are, as a counterpart, the boundaries imposed by
society.
It is important to understand that roles and identities must
be thought of in the crossroads between individuality and
society. Actually, it is difficult to place the individual under
perspective, to see it as a social construction, because as
something so fundamental in our culture, it is perceived as
absolute truth, inalienable, independent, and beyond every
concrete social or historical experience. This reification and
universalization of the individual seems to be the path fol-
lowed by part of the discussion on social identity. Our ethno-
centrism transforms the "idea" of the individual into
something absolute. The Brazilian anthropologist Roberto
DaMatta (1983) observed,
One could say that the English anthropology seems to present a
kind of contradiction: if, on one side, there is a search to forming
a collective or holistic perspective, there is, on the other side, a
need to forever recover the individual, who is, in fact, an
irreducible value of his own system. (p. 44)
Roberto DaMatta criticizes a few studies of Edmund
Leach about social organization that, like others in English
anthropology, tend to look over society as a result of assem-
bled trajectories, transactions, and individual strategies.
Depicted like this, social life comes as reference, invention,
and result of an unstoppable negotiation of private and indi-
vidual interests. But, if we think that "individual" and "indi-
vidualism" are concepts more related to our ideology than
with the effective nature of identity, we may move forward to
a less-social-centric perspective from where we can start
thinking about social identities.
The individual should be seen as a social category.
Furthermore, it is important to understand that is not every
society that transforms the individual in a substance so rele-
vant to its existence. For Western culture, the individual is
the center of the system, a kind of measure to many attitudes
and thoughts before the world, and configures an inner space,
appearing as an isolated unit opposite to the social system.
To us, the individual is a place of choice, owner of feelings,
and author of our intimate novel, capable of establishing
many of the rules of the world we inhabit. However, it is also
an ideological elaboration of certain social systems. The
reality of the individual as something empirical and physical
does not assure that every culture transforms it into a social
value. Continuing with Roberto DaMatta (1979),
On one side, we have the empirically given notion of the
individual as concrete reality, natural, inevitable, independent of
ideologies, and collective and individual representations. Thus,
we know that there is no human social constitution without the
individual. But, between recognizing the empirical existence of
the individual and surprising it like a relevant and active social
unit, capable of generating coexisting ideals of individualism
and equalitarianism, there is a social and historical fact, a
product of the development of a specific social structure: the
Western civilization. (p. 171)
There is a great distance between the empirical reality of
the discontinuity of bodies and individualism as an ideologi-
cal elaboration of a given society. This distance is enough to
avoid a general and absolute understanding of social identity
based on the reification of the individual. So, once again, if
we consider the individual in a relativistic perspective, from
what should identities be thought of? When placing the con-
cept of social role in the intersection between individual and
society, Dahrendorf offers a direction. If his terms--individ-
ual and society--betray the social centric angle mentioned
by DaMatta, the idea that identity happens in an intersection
is interesting. Better explaining, the identity is located in a
crossroads, but this must be free of predetermined contents.
It needs a place, except this place does not need to be where
the categories of individual and society intersect. It is a fact
that the individual--a value socially and historically elabo-
rated by a "specific social structure"--cannot be, at the same
time, one of the axes that define identity to every culture. As
something elaborated by a determined culture--the Western
civilization--the individual becomes parallel to society and
not paired to it, making any crossing impossible. However,
to think the concept of social identity as an intersection
between two axes, clear from contents specific to a single
society, enables a relativistic point of view where two lines
intersect, not of individual and society, but of classification
and value.
This "geometric" metaphor serves as exercise, for it
allows another angle to think about social identities. Like so
many anthropological themes, the notion requires a fine-tun-
ing involving ideas sufficiently abstract to resist the ethno-
graphic diversity and precise enough to interpret the concrete
social experience. The reflection concerning social identity
is a paradox, because it must suppose the specific singularity
of every culture and, then again, the presence of the phenom-
enon in multiple cultures. That is why the issue of social
identity requires an open interpretation, like the ideas of clas-
sification and value, which result in particular forms of
choice and accomplishment of the concrete identity when
Rocha 5
intersected in any context. Classification and value are means
of construction, operation, and distribution of social identi-
ties. Through them it is possible to walk away from the eth-
nocentric entrapment, avoiding the Western individual as
explanation to the notion of identity in every society.
Classification is a place in the structure to be necessarily
filled so the world becomes coherent and intelligible to social
actors. The work of Lévi-Strauss (1970, 1975) showed that
the necessary coherence to wholeness means to allow multi-
ple translations among its parts; however, these parts may
permanently serve as means to recover this wholeness. The
integration establishes distinct meanings, or values, that are
spaces filled with content by the position the very classifica-
tion system defines. Thus, classification indicates a specific
position, whereas value gives meaning to this position in the
structure. This pair, classification and value, enables one to
understand how, in a given social system, local conditions
define a set of local identities. In this sense, classification
and value are ways of dealing creatively with the particular
and the universal in social identities. Next, I propose to test
these ideas in advertising, making explicit its classificatory
nature and looking at values the media uses to dress up the
feminine identity.
Advertisements, Totemic Systems, and
Consumption
According to the teachings of Lévi-Strauss (1970) in "The
Savage Mind," classifying is an exhaustive process. It is how
culture inscribes its particularities in the world. Nothing
would make sense if we did not obtain meaning from every-
thing that surrounds us. This process establishes order, dif-
ference, and meaning. The existence assumes a human
atmosphere; everything takes place, because, to us, it is
impossible to live in inconsistency, a kind of "jelly world,"
like Mary Douglas's (1966) fortunate expression.
Lévi-Strauss indicated that what in anthropology was
called "totemism" is, in fact, a homology between two sepa-
rate systems. A classification of things that uses differences
within the natural order converted into differences within the
cultural order. The classification scheme said to be totemic is
how certain societies find coherence in the world through the
exchange of messages, the mutual translation or dialog
between nature and culture. Matching both systems is how
cultures make particular "readings" to transform "their"
world in an integrated space. But, to find coherence in com-
plementing nature with culture, the totemic logic needs to
make time cyclic instead of linear, to bet on the structure and
its establishment, trying to suspend the passing of historical
time. Alternatively, societies like ours, with the central axis
that gives meaning to the world in the linear time plan, often
refuse classification systems that, like "totemism," are
machines for the suppression of time (Lévi-Strauss, 1970).
But even in our societies there are openings, ruptures, and
contradictions that allow the existence of domains where
categorization operates in a way similar to the "totemic"
model. Here we start to think of advertising as a classifica-
tion system. In ads routinely transmitted to us a drama that
reminds life is enacted, although painless, free of misery,
anguish, doubt, or human frailty. Something that is just per-
fect. Products have feelings, there is no death, and happiness
is absolute. Children smile, women desire, men are fulfilled,
and oldness beatifies. Ads show a world that is neither truth-
ful nor misleading: it is magical. In advertising (like in
myths), we can follow narratives where animals speak and
magical events repeat themselves. In the "society of reason"
reigns a tacit commitment to believing in the impossible,
accepting realities elaborated in ads that, based on everyday
"real" life, produce idealized narratives.
Advertising is a way to categorize, classify, hierarchize,
and ordinate The World of Goods (Douglas & Isherwood,
1979) as well as relationships between people through con-
sumption. We know the manifest function of ads is to sell
products and services, but a simple observation is enough to
notice that, in a certain way, goods are the least consumed.
Every ad sells lifestyles, feelings, and worldviews, in gener-
ously larger portions than cars, clothes, or toys. Products
and services are aimed to possible buyers, but advertising
messages are distributed indistinctively, indicating its clas-
sificatory destiny. Advertising speaks of the eternal, sup-
presses time, cuts differences in the series of production,
and converts them into differences in the series of consump-
tion. Advertising, then, performs the very clear function of
mediating the opposition between those two economical
domains. Ads recreate products, giving them an identity,
specifying, and preparing them, at last, to an existence no
longer imbibed in the dynamic of production, but in the
middle of human relations, symbolic and social, that charac-
terize consumption.
Under certain aspects, production and consumption are
substantially different processes. The first happens among
materials and machines. Anonymity and sequencing are
rules, and products are multiple and impersonal. Production
is the domain where human is absent and alienated from
work (Marx & Engels, 1992). However, products that are
impersonal, sequenced, and anonymous must be consumed
by human beings and introduced in discontinued social seg-
ments, incorporated in spheres of singularity. They must
have a face, a name, and a story to occupy a place in the
symbolic order.
To balance differences, advertising, and marketing need
to skip the production process and the social history of prod-
ucts to reencounter "humanity" in the symbolic instance. In
the bourgeois world, consumption is the arena of difference
where products and services are one of the central elements
in the construction of our identities, worldviews, and life-
styles.Nothingisconsumedinaneutralfashion.Consumption
translates a universe of distinctions; products and services
accomplish their classificatory nature through the symbolism
attached to them. The advertising system gives names,
6 SAGE Open
contents, representations, and meanings to a constant flow of
goods. Many would not even make sense if a label did not
offer them the proper classificatory information.
Advertising classifies products, gives meanings to ser-
vices, positions goods, and elaborates hierarchies of objects.
This system draws a map of needs and reasons, or it writes a
script of feelings that attaches contents to types of products,
making them specific brands endowed with a name, a place,
and a meaning. Thus, advertising is an instrument of selec-
tion and categorization of the world, creating nuances and
particularities in the domain of production and, mutually, dif-
ferentiating groups, situations and states of spirit in the
human domain of consumption.
The classification principle acting within advertising
enables the idea of studying the issue of social identity
through its vast materials and, specifically in this article, how
ads choose contents that are fixed as representations of the
woman. But, there is still another axis--value--to under-
stand social identity. When classification happens, it defines
a space, so, the next step is to investigate values that fill it.
Let us see how these values operate, studying a group of ads
that, due to product or thematic, need to classify the feminine
universe, to construct an image and to elaborate an identity
of the woman.
Brazilian Society in the 1980s: Notes on
Methodology
This work examines a corpus of ads with the purpose to
reveal advertising representations of women in the Brazilian
society from 1980 through 1989. To investigate media dis-
courses that refer to the female universe, standard one-page
ads are used here for a textual analysis (Bauer & Gaskell,
2002; Duarte & Barros, 2009; Titscher, Meyer, Wodak, &
Vetter, 2000). Both the visual and the written dimensions of
advertisements were considered in this investigation, aiming
to identify some of the main characteristics of women's
media images of that time. Hence, the analysis reflects on the
syncretism between visual and verbal languages, which are
basic aspects of every ad in print. In effect, advertising pub-
lished in magazines, of weekly or monthly distribution, ade-
quately conjugate verbal language with visual and image
manifestations to express and materialize abstract contents,
to fulfill its commercial purpose.
Ads were selected from five Brazilian magazines, "Nova,"
"Claudia," "Playboy," "Isto É," and "Veja," which are still
among the leading publications of the Brazilian editorial
market today. The compiled material was separated into
21 classes, according to the type of product or service
announced. This typology is a "native" process of classifying
ads used in the professional world of advertising to establish
categories in its innumerous contests and prizes. In a previ-
ous work (Rocha, 2010), I adopted the same criteria to ana-
lyze the "liquor" class. Now, the chosen categories are
"cosmetics and toilette" and "clothing and textiles." The first
includes ads for creams, lipstick, lotions, perfumes, powder,
bathing salts, dentifrices, deodorants, soaps, shampoos,
depilatories, sprays, hair dye, nail polish, brush, and comb in
general; tanners, feminine napkins, shaving razors, and
related items. The second comprises ads for clothing in gen-
eral; lingerie; textiles; wools; leather goods; shoes; bed, bath,
and table linen; and sports apparels. Both categories were
elected because these kinds of products advertise mainly to
the feminine public.
Magazines collected totalize 1,400 editions from 1980
through 1989. Today, these publications have approximately
200 pages per edition. In the 1980s, an average issue had
about 100 pages. At that time, as today, around 50% of an
edition was dedicated to one-page ads. The universe is esti-
mated in 70,000 ads, which were divided considering the
21 categories mentioned above. Evidently, some categories
have more products and services advertised than others. But
on average, we can estimate there is something like 3,300
ads for each category. For this analysis, two categories were
chosen, "cosmetics and toilette" and "clothing and textiles."
Considering that, in these categories, about 20% of adver-
tisements are directed to the male readership, there were
5,280 ads available for examination. Nearly 5% of them
(260 ads) offer us a significant material to discuss the wom-
an's image, because they emphasize her body, sensuality, and
beauty. Among this selection, here are presented some of the
advertisements for the following brands: Max Factor, Chique,
Appel, Del Rio, DeMillus, DuLoren, Lib Slip, Matitte,
McChad, Sulfabril, U.S. Top, Helena Rubinstein, Hidraskin,
Skin Dew, Wella, Sanny, Power Bust Flex, and Dropnyl.
Another important thing that gives consistency to this tex-
tual analysis and that may offer us some clues to understand
the image of women is the identification of the Brazilian his-
torical context in the 1980s. This should help us understand
the ideological patterns that appear on women representa-
tions in ads, which are directly related to cultural models,
political behavior, economic reality, and social life as experi-
enced in great Brazilian urban centers of that time. In fact,
the 1980s in Brazil were characterized as a crucial moment
of passage from a military dictatorship, which began in
March 1964, to a desired redemocratization. This transition
was gradual, slowly conquered, but still a sustained process
that began in the late 1970s and was fulfilled with the presi-
dential election in 1989, the first one to happen by popular
vote in almost 30 years.
In 1960, Brazilian voters elected democratically the presi-
dent Jânio Quadros for 5 years. However, within a year the
president suddenly renounced his post and was replaced by
vice-president João Goulart. This was a period of political
turmoil with changes in the government system from presi-
dentialism to parlamentarism and back again. In an ideologi-
cally complicated and tense setting, a military coups d'état
occurred in March 31, 1964 (Dreifuss, 1980). This military
regime ruled the country for the next 20 years, alternating
five generals in the presidency, attested by a submissive
Rocha 7
national congress that was powerless to question military
decisions. The dictatorship created its own laws, started to
censor the media, violently pursued adversaries of the
regime, and destroyed organized political groups and parties.
The remaining professional politicians, by personal interest
or by lack of options, accepted the military terms and were
divided into the only two parties that were permitted, MDB
(Movimento Democrático Brasileiro [Brazilian Democratic
Movement]) and Arena (Gaspari, 2002a). A private Brazilian
joke of the time said that the country possessed two parties;
one that said "yes" (MDB) and the other that said "yes, sir"
(Arena) to military orders.
The dictatorship reached its most radical moment between
the end of the 1960s and the first half of the 1970s with the
publication of the "institutional acts" establishing nondemo-
cratic changes in the Constitution. This is the moment of
greatest repression in the cultural and political levels that the
country has experienced in recent history. No newspaper,
radio, television, or magazine could publish anything with-
out a previous censorship. The cultural production--of
books, movie pictures, theater, fine arts, dance, and even
soap operas--was roughly censored (Gaspari, 2002b).
Because of this terrible climate of cultural oppression, it
almost became mandatory for the media, including advertis-
ing, to use patriotic elements and support the so-called
"Brazilian economical miracle" in its narratives. The main
local client of advertising agencies at the time was the very
government that demanded self-promotion campaigns to
exalt its accomplishments and ideology. However, in the sec-
ond half of the 1970s, economic crisis allied to changes in
the international political scenario led to an increase of popu-
lar dissatisfaction that forced the military to begin a process
of opening the regime, including the amnesty of political
exiled in 1979. The ads that were selected for the present
analysis were published during the 1980s, a period of increas-
ing political and cultural flexibility, with elections of state
governors by popular vote and the election of a civil presi-
dent by the national congress (Gaspari, 2003).
For the purpose of this study, this is a crucial period,
because, besides incipient possibilities of once again estab-
lishing democratic political practices, other social forces
also repressed by the regime started to find spaces for their
manifestations. This is the case of the feminist movement
and the growing presence of women in Brazilian social, cul-
tural, and political life (Costa & Sardenberg, 2002). In 1980,
for example, Rede Globo, the most important Brazilian net-
work since that time and currently among the biggest of the
world, launched two television shows that placed women's
everyday problems and possibilities as central issues of
debate. One of them was a prime time fictional series called
"Malu Mulher" (in English, Malu Woman) that approached
themes such as female work, masculine oppression, sexual
and affective conflicts, and so on. The other one was a vari-
ety show called "TV Mulher" (in English, TV Woman) that
touched from conservative things, like culinary and
decoration, to bold subjects, as freedom, oppression, work
market, and the intimacy of the body. Incidentally, the
aggressive sexuality of films such as "Fatal Attraction"
(United States, 1987), in which a man is threatened by the
obsessive desire of a woman, was subject of exciting con-
versations in social gatherings in Rio de Janeiro. This was
also a time when many women singers, such as Rita Lee,
Maria Bethânia, Simone, Joana, Fafá de Belém, among oth-
ers, became big stars of the Brazilian pop music with songs
that expressed the female point of view about love, relation-
ships, desire, and so forth. (Fernandes, 1987; Mattos, 2010;
Ribeiro, Sacramento, & Roxo, 2010; Xavier, 2007). In uni-
versities and Brazilian scientific associations of the Social
Sciences, women's studies, feminism, and gender-related
issues began to appear as respectable objects of academic
debates, supported by scholarships and research grants. In
1981, the Brazilian government sanctioned the United
Nations convention of 1967 about the elimination of every
form of discrimination against women. Also, during the
1980s, more governmental and private companies began to
admit women in their staffs (Costa & Sardenberg, 2002;
Miceli, 1995).
This complex process of political and cultural redemocra-
tization of the 1980s in Brazil is marked by, as expected, an
increase of repressed demands. The feminine universe repro-
duces this exact atmosphere of breaking limits and creating
possibilities. For women, the beginning of public discussions
concerning their insertion in society as professionals, sexual-
ity, maternity dilemmas, and political participation formed a
compound of multiple, diffuse, fragmented, and scattered
needs and expectations. This brief review of the redemocra-
tization period in Brazil gives us a concrete indication to
understand the cultural circumstances behind the female rep-
resentation in advertising. Therefore, the ads analyzed in this
article express their connection with their time, constructing
the woman's image as an individual with uncertain possibili-
ties in a body that is exposed in multiple fragments and
desires of consumption.
The Body in Pieces: The Woman's
Fragmentation
The designated place in the classifications system and the
hierarchical position indicate a space to be covered up with
values that build the feminine identity. The first thing to be
noticed is that in advertising images women are classified in
a counterpart relationship before men, and also, before sev-
eral types of women. The "woman's" identity differentiates
itself as well from the notions of "girl" or "young lady." In an
advertisement for "Max Factor," for instance, an exuberant
woman's picture and a line define the difference: "Some
things are just better in a woman than in a girl." The woman's
identity is shaped in the advertising system by its distin-
guished places facing the masculine universe as well as the
ideas of "girl." This place may even be the same as of a
8 SAGE Open
"thing," as a text for "Del Rio" lingerie, along with photos of
women significantly without a face, suggests,
In a soft Lycra set by Del Rio many beautiful and well made
things fit: the Lycra bands and more resistant seam, the bra's
shaped pad, the panty's anti-allergic cotton interior, the charming
backstitch, needle or lacework, and, it fits you, another pretty
and very well made little thing.
Similar to a "thing," different from a "girl" or subordinate
to the "man," the woman's identity will find a space between
contrasts that is covered up with values. A fundamental value
that articulates all others is the attribution of the idea of indi-
vidual to the feminine identity. The need to assure the woman
as a "human being," and how she as well can be considered
an "individual," appears very clearly in a text displayed to
promote the "Nova" magazine to advertising agencies:
"Nova is the magazine of the woman as a human being.
Nova is not the family magazine, is not the household maga-
zine, or the children magazine. It is the magazine of the
woman as an individual." The idea of individual or of indi-
viduality is a striking value in the construction of the wom-
an's identity. For example, an ad for "Chique" perfume
states--"There are many ways you can be yourself. But none
of them are quite that chic." Also, like the ads transcribed
below for "Matitte" and "DuLoren":
Matitte is the jeans label that respects all your gestures, your
expressions and your individuality. Wherever you are, it is the
pair of jeans that follows your will to come and go freely. No
censures, no inhibitions. Involve yourself with Matitte jeans.
This summer, be a woman even underwater. Wear a DuLoren
bathing suit. And leap. Leap in the sun, into the sea or in the
swimming pool. Leap in fashion. With the new DuLoren
submarine collection you are much more of a woman, inside or
out of the water.
The ideas of "you being yourself," the respect to "indi-
viduality" and "be a woman even underwater" show the first
sign advertisements establish in the feminine identity. It
seems so necessary to claim the woman is "herself," has a
"self," and shows "authenticity" as if an obvious collective
value--the individual--needs to make explicit that the
woman belongs as well to it. To build or to reinforce the indi-
vidual as value is a fundamental advertising operation. Ads
must emphasize buying as an act of will, dictated by rules of
choice, and the individual as its decisive instance.
Accordingly, terms such as want, desire, choice, will, free-
dom, and others alike are often used with eloquence in adver-
tising narratives. These are generic ideas that can be used for
selling dresses to women as much as for selling cars to men.
So far, the analysis suggests that ads for men and women can
be quite similar. Regardless of the identity at stake in repre-
sentations and images, the desire to reinforce the individual
as a central value is present. Advertisements define
consumption as a supposed arena of individual choices,
implying it as a "natural" act, something in the free will
sphere, carried out in the subjective decision plan, being
affirmation, choice and exercise of singularity. In this sense,
an ad only synthesizes a key operation to the greater phe-
nomenon of consumption.
However, while it does not seem necessary to reinforce
the relationship between male "individuality" and consumer
goods, there appears to be a recurrent emphasis in connect-
ing female "individuality" to products and services. This dif-
ference becomes more evident when investigating values
that are specifically distributed to elaborate the individuality
imbued in the feminine identity. The individual as a "woman"
turns into a "body." so now its possession, use, beauty, treat-
ment, and enhancement are at stake. The body is a property,
a fundamental good, and value of this individuality, a terri-
tory of feminine action, as clearly established in many ads.
For example, one for "Artemis" expresses this idea in a sim-
ple line: "Artemis, the best in your body." Another one, for
"DeMillus," is more emphatic and, after the title "Put your
body in the right places" a text compares the idea of indi-
viduality with the woman's body:
The woman needs to position her body in relation to life: she
needs to come out with presence, stirring up love fires. To do so,
she must always be in the right places, letting nothing escape
from all a woman has to offer. With DeMillus modelers, you put
your body in the right places.
The body as main possession, the very translation, of the
"woman" individual is recurrent in several ads. But, what is
significant in many of them, different from others that speak
of the whole body, is the focus in different and fragmented
body parts. An ad for "McChad" jeans serves as an example
of this approach, while focusing on "waist," "buttock," and
"thighs," along with the text "Brazilian anatomy. Few jeans
fabricants understand the lyrics to this samba." Another one
refers only to the "buttock" and, along with a meaningful
picture, gives women an order to "Enhance the filling of Lib
Slip--the disposable panty." This body in pieces may be
depicted also as just the "breasts":
How to keep your breasts firm and stiff? Forget all you have
ever seen about miraculous balsams, creams and ointments to
stiffen your breasts. There is only one organic and natural way to
accomplish this: strengthening the major pectorals. And there is
only a way to strengthen them: making specific exercise, like
Power Bust Flex.
The body fragmentation continues in representations of
the woman's "face" that, in the following ads for "Helena
Rubinstein" products, appears prominently in photo and text:
The power of pastels. The summer makeup. Gentle tones, but
vibrant at the same time . . . created specially to enhance your
face in the irresistible fashion of pastels colors.
Rocha 9
Finally, there is a compact eye shadow that lasts longer. Have a
firm and uniform coloring, in a delicate movement, with the new
applier that is adjusted to your eyes' natural curves.
There are many possibilities for advertising to translate
the feminine individuality as property of a body and its parts.
And advertisements indefinitely fragment the body, breaking
it up in as many pieces as necessary to the product--hair,
foot, hand, nail, eye, eyelash, leg, breast, buttock, tooth, skin,
among others. In this dismantled body, a part outstands itself
for its constant need of treatment. The skin, according to ads,
is always, somewhat "sick" or "damaged" and in need of
"treatment." As it is perceptible in the following texts,
Hidraskin. It is the most simple and efficient way to treat your
skin. Whatever your skin type, the new Hidraskin line is the
complete care you need. Make your beauty treatment with
Hidraskin and have a healthy, soft and very, very pretty skin.
After creating the makeup, Max Factor creates the beauty
treatment within the makeup. Whipped cream makeup
collection, the makeup treatment. You make yourself up. You
treat your skin. Now, you have a makeup line so rich in
moisturizers that act as a beauty treatment while you are with
your makeup on.
The quite "indecipherable" universe of the "skin" and, by
definition, its permanent "lack of treatment" is a chapter
apart, deserving another complete study for itself. And, no
matter the skin, because "if you have normal or dry skin, Skin
Dew is the most complete and efficient treatment line you can
find." In this very particular fragment of the body, notions
such as health, treatment, profundity, moisturizing, humec-
tants, dry, beauty, natural oils, and others, repeat themselves,
creating a world at least unknown and dangerous if not prop-
erly protected by products. A careful study of texts from
advertisements of "skin" products gives interesting clues to a
reflection over the things this mysterious "dermatological"
world of ads is capable of. Inevitably, this reminds the atten-
tive comments of Barthes (1972) concerning the very peculiar
appropriation of ads over the idea of profundity:
All advertising of beauty products is based, as well, in a sort of
epic representation of the intimate. The little scientific
introductions destined to publicize products tell us that it cleans
in profundity, clears in profundity and nourishes in profundity,
that is, whatever costs, it infiltrates. Paradoxically, it is because
the skin, before all, is a surface, but live surface, therefore
mortal, and susceptible of drying and ageing that it easily
imposes itself as tributary of profound roots, of something that
certain products call as the basic renovation layer. (p. 58)
However, the body's representation goes beyond the pure
and simple possession of its parts, as they must be "embel-
lished," "enhanced" and "accentuated." Once it is the main
property, a kind of fundamental good of exchange, of this
"woman individual," it will have to be more. Like the exam-
ple that follows, it will have to be "stretchy" as well:
This fabric's elasticity is the latest thing by U.S. Top. It stretches
where it needs to: in width. A fabric like this allows a perfect
adjustment that values your body and your swing. As for your
body's stretchiness, you just have to do a little work out.
The body has to be "elastic," "stretched," with "swing."
The many possibilities translated by images of the feminine
body appear as well in ads for a "DeMillus" campaign,
through the women's expressions in photos and contents of
the following texts:
Free the flower of your body. Your body is a flower. And flowers
need freedom to blossom. In light moves, appearance fitting to
moments, its lines must correspond to the situations. DeMillus
gives the liberty you need, with soft, stretchy and caress full bras
that allow your body the freedom to show itself.
Feel a touch to your body. The touches in your body should be
the right caresses in the right places. DeMillus has a nice touch
for you to always remember: soft, shapeable, comfortable, a
dream of stretchiness. DeMillus has the prettiest touch to a
woman in this bra detailed with a Richelieu cut that will never
let you forget your charms.
The sweetest embrace you can be granted with. The embrace
from DeMillus is full of emotion: warm, soft, stretchy, modeler,
to be remembered forever. DeMillus understands a woman's
needs and transmits its quality in little sets like this, in striped
Lycra, that embraces a woman's body like it needs to be.
The representation of the woman's body expresses free-
dom, because its nature is of a "flower" that wishes to "blos-
som." Her body must be "caressed," "soft" the way you like
it. It must always "remember" the "gentle touches," getting
"the right caresses in the right places." The body, modeled
and bendy, is ready to receive the "sweetest embrace" that
must be "full of emotion." Therefore, products "understand a
woman's needs" better than anyone else.
The body is marked as a central value of the woman's
individuality. Furthermore, it is in many ways fragmented,
variegated, detailed, and scrutinized. It is divided into parts,
and some of them may be "enhanced" while others can be
"treated." The body must be "stretchy," "embraced,"
"caressed," "touched," and "free." It is a flower, and also
permanently in lack of something, needing to be "cared,"
"embellished," and "accentuated." After all, the body, while
property and basic element of the individual, must be used as
the main strength, power, and locus of the event of the wom-
an's individuality.
Still, the woman's image in advertising is more complex.
It must be submitted to the broader representation of the indi-
vidual in our culture. And that is certainly experimented to
some extent by the body, but its main emphasis is toward
10 SAGE Open
something this body carries as essence, content, or substance.
The "individual" would articulate and result from the com-
pound of elements of body and spirit. But, generally, the sub-
stance--described in our culture in terms like "mind,"
"soul," "head," "self," "spirit," and so on--overcomes the
material dimension--the body--that sustains it. That is why,
not even in the magical world of advertisements, the femi-
nine individuality may just be framed by the body.
The woman represented in ads has to be more. It is up to
advertising to balance and distinguish the dimensions of
"substance" and "body" between genders. On one hand, the
"substance" and its qualities usually prevail in the masculine
identity, and on the other hand, the "body" and its qualities
prevail in the feminine identity. Nevertheless, as seen before,
it is necessary to amass other values to make compatibles of
both components of "individuality" as a broad cultural repre-
sentation. Thus, the woman in advertisements assumes con-
tents apparently more "spiritual" in search to recover
coherence between terms. For example, in the next ad for
"Wella's Kolestral" cream, under the title "made up mind
woman," a text speaks of other values:
In charge, up to date and ready for life. Every day she
accomplishes her own space in order to fulfill her fundamental
role in society. This is the woman today that always values her
own charm. She never lets go of what she holds as most
important: her femininity.
Following this path of feminine "spiritual" values, it is
perceptible the existence of some ideas that offer "content"
to this "individual." The woman must be as well other things
that are added to and dialogue with the body. She must be
sometimes "in charge," others "up to date," almost always
"ready." Like an ad for "Sanny," a clothing fabricant, teaches
us, the product ought to propose "new intimacy concepts"
and the "intimate" content, that will fill the inner space,
explains itself in the image of a woman with a provocative
look, half-open mouth, wearing only her underwear. Beneath
the title "woman in very saucy version," the feminine indi-
viduality acquires characteristics defined by a text that
explains: "Sanny proposes new intimacy concepts. It is
something that has much to do with the new, emancipated,
and very sexy woman of our time."
The content of the body, therefore, is of "a new, sexy,
emancipated woman of our time." She must affirm, emphati-
cally, her inner self, as the following ads state, "I wear
Dropnyl because I am beautiful, modern, and intelligent" or
"I wear Dropnyl because I love compliments." Besides
affirming the self, an ad for "Sulfabril" shows other contents,
because the represented woman must "dare to use a Sulfabril
fabric" and "stick to a promise until the end." The idea of
individual in feminine version present in ads is slightly
emphasized and refers to a plan--erotic, beautiful, sensual--
that finds, again, in the body its only instance possible of
translation.
Nonetheless, this "individual" needs to "speak." And, it is
from the "substance" or "spirit" that speech is made possible.
As the feminine individuality that advertising projects is,
mostly, sustained by the "body," words will have to be
expressed by another instance: the product. As seen in texts
like "Find yourself in a DuLoren" or "Conquer your space by
the cloth you wear," the product assumes itself, decisively, as
the woman's speech: "Elegance, class and lots of charm.
Appel: the perfume that speaks for you." When reading the
next ads, it is curious to notice how "she" delegates her ideas
and words to products that, at last, take charge of the "inner
woman" as representatives expressing desires, wants,
thoughts, and emotions:
Lipmaker: a luminous idea in your lips. It is mainly with your
lips that you show to have brilliant thoughts. That is why Max
Factor created Lipmaker, a lipstick different from everything
you have ever seen. Put this word in your mouth: Lipmaker.
Make your words last even when conversation is over. Max
Factor Color Fast Long Lasting Lipstick. A lipstick that has a
formula specifically created to stick more to your lips. With the
new Color Fast Lipstick from Max Factor you put a colorful and
sparkling cream in your lips, that lasts as much as the impressive
things you say. With Color Fast Lipstick the conversation may
still end, but never the spark.
Thus, it is possible to realize how ads elaborate a version
of the feminine identity attaching certain marks and signs to
it. First, there is the previously discussed idea of "individ-
ual," as it is a fundamental operation of advertising to trans-
form the impersonality of production into the particularity of
consumption. The "individual" is emphasized as basis to the
identity, because consumption must be experimented as a
volunteer act, a kind of affirmation of the "self," something
in the sphere of private choices. The "woman" portrayed
supposes the presence of a consumer individual whose value
is reproduced in ads in general. Therefore, the starting point
is to construct the woman's representation as an "individual"
that has the desire for consumption as its core value.
Second, the woman's representation in advertisements
has its individuality specifically characterized in the idea that
this "woman individual" means primarily the ownership of a
"body." However, this "body" is not represented as a "natu-
ral" unit. It is divided into parts and manipulated to become
matter capable of being indefinitely fragmented, like a
mosaic formed by pieces that, if isolated, do not outline a
picture and, therefore, do not signify. This body, dissolved
into many fragments, is the main power of the "woman indi-
vidual" that, through it and almost exclusively by using it,
makes herself bold, modern, seductive, in charge, and so on.
The feminine body, when broken into multiple pieces, makes
somewhat impossible the unified construction of a funda-
mental dimension of individuality, that is, its "substance"--
"mind," "spirit," and so on--so the individual can be
Rocha 11
complete. The representation of a fragmented "body" may
indicate that an equally fragmented "substance" matches it.
So, individuality does not acquire consistency, and, the inner
plan does not sustain itself.
In this sense, the "woman individual," as shown in adver-
tising, when existing mainly as a fragmented body, makes
impracticable the construction of an "inner plan" and, conse-
quently, the realization of speech. The third mark fixed to the
feminine identity in ads is that of a silent woman that pos-
sesses a body, and must know how to use it, although to this
body words are forbidden. As "she" does not own a "sub-
stance" or, at least, has it in precarious form, her speech is
pushed to another instance. Hence, the "woman" in advertis-
ing assigns "words" to products that "speak" for her, reveal
her "ideas" and express her inner self as "needs" and
"desires." Only they can understand her.
Certainly, a broader study of the woman's image through-
out advertising would include further dimensions not per-
ceived in this exercise. The analysis of other types of
products--for children, cleaning, foods, or household appli-
ances--could tend to indicate, for example, the existence of
the woman's representation as "housewife" or "mother."
Advertising studied as a production system of the imaginary
of our culture raises complex questions, so, this article does
not presume to exhaust the subject. It is but an effort to debate
the problems of social identity from the thoughts of classifi-
cation and value axes and through the investigation in ads.
This work showed some basic cuts of the feminine iden-
tity as elaborated in advertising. From the analysis of a
"woman" created by ads emerges the image of individuality
where the "body"--and not the "substance"--is what mat-
ters. Also, advertising reveals that the feminine body suffers
a process through which unity is lost and parts prevail over
whole. The woman represented in ads exists, above all, in
pieces--breast, foot, leg, skin, face, nail, hand, buttock, eye,
lip, lash, thigh, and whatever else may be detached--as an
inverted puzzle with dislocated bits hiding the picture that is
never formed. Of course, this image of the body, and its
pieces, cannot sustain the individual as wholeness. Thus, the
Western individual, while believing in materiality and sub-
stance, transforms itself in something twice as uneven. On
one hand, because individuality is seen as a relationship
between body and spirit, matter and substance, and not as
only one of these terms and, on the other hand, because not
even the body, which subsists in the feminine individuality,
is integrated. So, like the individual in the woman's image
from ads was undone by the absence of substance, also the
matter--the remaining term--is undone by the lack of unity
between parts. And then, the "woman" represented in ads
silences, as speech is an expression of the "spirit," proper of
singularity. What is left of the woman's image is a body, or,
pieces, rests, fragments of it that, without alternative, dele-
gate words to products.
Therefore, ads analyzed in this article suggest that the
female body is divided, broken, shattered into multiple
fragments, to serve for consumption purposes. A "woman in
pieces" appears as an ideological strategy to open new mar-
ket spaces for products and services that become holders of
these ever more specific territories of the body. In the 1980s,
in the midst of the Brazilian redemocratization period, when
new political forces--including feminism--looked to give
voice to their demands and to reach for spaces, the woman's
image projected in advertising is silenced. The fights for
female liberty that occur at the time are transformed into
mere consumer desires. In fact, ads reveal a woman frag-
mented into several parts that translate the idea of a perfect
female body as the support for a wide variety of consumer
goods and, at the same time, this body becomes itself the
very object of consumption. Finally, the "woman" con-
structed by ads lets products assume their place as owners of
choices, desires and needs. They "speak" for her, and, cer-
tainly, in advertising representations, the woman must keep
herself in silence.
