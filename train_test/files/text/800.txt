A Profile Of
Uncompensated
Hospital Care, 1983-1995
A look at who provides the most uncompensated care and what
effect market conditions have on care for the poor.
byJoyce M. Mann, Glenn A. Melnick, Anil Bamezai, andJack Zwanziger
ABSTRACT: This DataWatch examines national trends in the provision of uncom-
pensated hospital care. It shows that rapid growth from 1983-1986 was followed
by modest growth through 1990, a time during which managed care was becom-
ing established in some regions. There was then another spurt in uncompen-
sated care from 1991-1993, a period that corresponds to sizable increases in
disproportionate-share payments. Uncompensated care growth again slowed
through 1995. The increase in uncompensated care levels after 1988 appears
not to have kept pace with growth in hospital expenses or the number of uninsured.
However, the trend data do not suggest a large-scale reduction of effort.
BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES lacks universal entitlement,
the health care system relies on charitable care by medical
providers to serve the 40.6 million uninsured.1 Hospitals, in
particular, serve as providers of last resort, a role enforced through
legal sanctions against turning away patients with life-threatening
or urgent conditions. The $17.5 billion in hospitals' uncompensated
care costs in 1995, which represented 6 percent of hospital expenses,
is testament to hospitals' vital role in protecting access to care.2
Hospitals have been able to fund uncompensated care through a
delicate balance of internal and external cross-subsidies. To a large
extent, this balance depends on hospitals' ability to receive reim-
bursement from paying patients that exceeds the cost of treating
those patients, a practice referred to as cost shifting. In a few states,
these cross-subsidies are made explicit through uncompensated
care trust funds as part of all-payer hospital rate-setting programs or
through the establishment of indigent care subsidies that offset
some of the costs of charity care.3 Explicit recognition of the burden

shouldered by a subset of providers is also acknowledged in both
Medicare and Medicaid through separate disproportionate-share
hospital (DSH) payment policies.4 In most places, however, the
cross-subsidies remain largely hidden.
There is growing concern that the system of subsidies that has
preserved the safety net is rapidly eroding because of managed care
growth and price competition, tightening of fiscal pressures begun
under Medicare's fixed-price payment system, and growth in the
number of uninsured persons. Recent analyses by the Prospective
Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC) show a striking rela-
tionship between fiscal pressure from private payers and uncompen-
sated care provided by hospitals.5 ProPACs findings indicate that
hospitals facing the most fiscal pressure from private payers greatly
reduced their uncompensated care load between 1992 and 1994.
Under Medicare's system of national payment rates, hospitals
face the risk of incurring financial losses on the Medicare share of
their business, which is not inconsequential given that Medicare
accounts for some 40 percent of hospital revenues on average. This
was particularly a threat in the 1980s as Medicare phased in national
diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment rates, and many hospitals
experienced negative Medicare margins.6
The growth ofmanaged care was spurred by the lifting of freedom-
of-choice guarantees that had precluded payers from limiting sub-
scribers' choice of provider. This mechanism strengthened the con-
tractual relationship between payers and providers, which led to
increasingly sophisticated specifications about payment terms, fi-
nancial incentives, and utilization oversight. In so doing, it shifted
bargaining power from providers to payers. The least price-sensitive
customer segment (the privately insured) became the most price-
sensitive and had the contractual means to enforce price discipline.
In this DataWatch we use data from the American Hospital Asso-
ciation's (AHA's) annual surveys to construct a profile of the provi-
sion ofuncompensated care by U.S. hospitals. The descriptive analy-
ses report on trends in the aggregate amounts of uncompensated
care over time and examine how the burden of uncompensated care
is distributed by hospital characteristics such as ownership, teach-
ing status, Medicaid volume, Medicare fiscal pressure, and competi-
tive market pressure. We identify the traditional providers of un-
compensated care and examine the extent to which competitive and
managed care pressures place them at financial risk for the future.
Study Description: Data And Variable Construction

1983-1995, which provides measures of uncompensated care costs,

total costs, and payer-specific utilization, costs, and revenues. Un-
compensated care costs consist of charity care and bad-debt charges
deflated by a hospital's cost-to-charge ratio.7 To report changes in
the uncompensated care burden over time, we constructed several
related measures. To adjust for inflation, we used the AHA hospital
market basket index (which adjusts for changes in the cost of hospi-
tal inputs) and report each year's uncompensated care costs in terms
of 1995 constant dollars. However, the rate of change in uncompen-
sated care costs depends to some extent on the choice of an inflation
deflator (for example, use of the Consumer Price Index produces
slightly different results). Using the ratio of uncompensated care
costs to total hospital costs circumvents this problem.
To adjust for increases in the number of uninsured persons, a key
determinant of the demand for uncompensated care, we calculated
the amount of uncompensated care per uninsured person.8 To nor-
malize for the many factors that influence growth in hospital costs
(for example, technological advances, changes in medical practice
patterns, and inflation in the prices of medical inputs), we con-
structed the ratio of uncompensated care costs per uninsured per-
son to covered costs per insured person. Covered costs are estimated
as total hospital expenses less uncompensated care costs. This ratio
can be thought of as the amount of hospital expenses devoted to the
uninsured relative to the insured. For example, a value of 0.30 indi-
cates that for every dollar of care provided to an insured person,
thirty cents of care is provided to uninsured persons.
Estimates of insurance coverage are taken from the U.S. Census
Bureau's Current Population Surveys (March series) for 1984-1995
(with adjustments made for 1983-1987 to reflect changes made in
survey methodology in 1988).9 Medicaid share is the proportion of a
hospital's days that are accounted for by Medicaid patients. Medi-
care fiscal pressure was measured as the financial gain or loss under
Medicare relative to a hospital's total expenses. The Herfindahl In-
dex was used to measure hospital competition and was constructed
using patient origin data available on the 100 percent MEDPAR file
of Medicare hospital discharges obtained from the Health Care Fi-
nancing Administration (HCFA).10 Health maintenance organiza-
tion (HMO) penetration was calculated for each Metropolitan Sta-
tistical Area (MSA) as the proportion of the total population
enrolled in an HMO. This measure was available only for hospitals
located in an MSA. These hospitals are divided into three groups:
low-penetration areas with less than 10 percent of the population
enrolled in HMOs, high-penetration areas with more than 20 per-
cent HMO enrollment, and the middle group in between.

National Trends In Uncompensated Care
The amount ofuncompensated care deliveredby allnonfederal com-
munity hospitals in the United States grew from $6.1 billion in 1983 to
$17.5 billion in 1995 (Exhibit 1). Even when measured in real terms,
uncompensated care grewby 150 percent from 1983 to 1995. Looking at
year-to-year levels shows that changes in uncompensated care can be
characterized by several phases. The years 1983 to 1986 represented a
period of uncompensated care expansion (except in 1985), growing
by 27percent over the time period (or 9 percent annually on average).
The rest of the 1980s showed more moderate growth in uncompen-
sated care, increasing by only 1.1 percent per year on average from
1986 through 1990. Uncompensated care growth picked up again in
1991, growing at an average annual rate of 4.4 percent from 1990
through 1993. It then stabilized and fell slightly in 1995.
Whether uncompensated care is measured in real terms or in
relative terms in Exhibit 1, 1983 to 1986 or 1987 was a period of
uncompensated care expansion (again with the exception of 1985).
The peak in uncompensated care relative to hospital expenses or
relative to the number of uninsured persons reached in 1986 and
1987, respectively, has not been reached again.

1980s and the bigger increases in the early 1990s were matched by
increases in hospital expenses, so the level ofuncompensated care as
a portion of hospital expenses was a relatively stable 6.0 percent
from 1989-1993 (after falling from the peak of 6.3 percent in 1986).
By 1994 and 1995, however, hospital expenses as a whole declined
more than uncompensated care, bumping up the portion of ex-
penses devoted to uncompensated care slightly to 6.1 percent.
Uncompensated care per uninsured person. Taking into ac-
count changes in the number of uninsured persons shows a slightly
different pattern of uncompensated care provision. After the peak of
1987, the amount of uncompensated care per uninsured person (in
real terms) declined through 1995. The sizable increases in the level
of uncompensated care during the early 1990s were outpaced by
growing numbers of uninsured persons.11
While uncompensated care per uninsured person appears to have
declined through 1995, the ratio that normalizes changes in uncom-
pensated care costs by changes in total (compensated) hospital
costs for the insured population shows a decline only through 1992,
after which the ratio is stabilized at about 0.36. It thus appears that
during 1992-1995, the growth of hospital costs slowed for both the
insured and uninsured populations.
The amount of hospital uncompensated care per uninsured per-
son in 1995 was roughly the same as the amount in 1984--$431 and
$433, respectively. But normalizing for factors that affected the
costs of hospital care over the decade indicates that uncompensated
care provision may be lower in 1995 than it was in 1984 (for every
dollar of compensated costs per insured person, thirty-six cents of
uncompensated care were generated per uninsured person in 1994
versus forty-two cents in 1984).
Who Provides Uncompensated Care?
Urban public and teaching hospitals. Much of the uncompen-
sated care burden is concentrated within urban public hospitals and
major public teaching hospitals (Exhibit 2). Urban public hospitals
account for one-third of the uncompensated care in this country,
which is double their share of the total hospital market. Much of the
uncompensated care in public hospitals is concentrated within the
teaching hospital segment: Major public teaching hospitals provide
triple the amount of uncompensated care relative to their share of
the overall hospital market; by 1994, almost a fifth of their expenses
was devoted to uncompensated care. Minor public teaching hospi-
tals also take on large amounts of uncompensated care.

tween public and private and between major teaching and non-

teaching hospitals did not appreciably change over the twelve-year
time period. In both 1983 and 1994, urban public hospitals ac-
counted for roughly 15 percent of the hospital market (as reflected
by expenses) and delivered slightly more than a third of the uncom-
pensated care. Although the distribution did not materially change,
urban public hospitals and major public teaching hospitals in-
creased their level of effort when measured against their own ex-
penses: In urban public hospitals, uncompensated care accounted
for 12.7 percent of total expenses in 1983 and 15.4 percent in 1994
(comparable figures for major public teaching hospitals were 16.8
percent and 18.9 percent, respectively). Although public hospitals
play a critical role in delivering services to indigent patients, 60
percent of uncompensated care is delivered by private hospitals.
Medicaid providers. Hospitals that serve a large share of Medic-
aid patients, already providers of a larger-than-proportionate share
of uncompensated care in 1983, absorbed an even bigger share of
uncompensated care in subsequent years. Not only did they increase
their own relative level of effort (from 6.7 percent of expenses in 1983

"Competitionplusgreaterprice sensitivity introduced by managed care
could lead topressures to slow thegrowth of uncompensated care"
to 9.5 percent in 1995), they took on a greater share of total uncom-
pensated care (from 46 percent to 56 percent). The tertile of hospi-
tals that serve the greatest share of Medicaid patients accounted for
well over half of the uncompensated care in the country.
The major role in uncompensated care delivery played by hospi-
tals with a large Medicaid load has enormous implications for states
that are shifting Medicaid recipients into managed care settings.
First, if HMOs serving Medicaid patients squeeze hospital payment
rates and utilization as anticipated, hospitals that historically have
depended on Medicaid revenue to meet their bottom line will be
more adversely affected than other hospitals will. Second, if Medic-
aid managed care is successful in mainstreaming recipients (as some
believe could happen with the entry of commercial HMOs into the
Medicaid market), traditional indigent care providers may see their
paying patient base evaporate, leaving them with an even greater
concentration of uninsured and indigent patients but without the
revenue to support their care. Even if the shift in patients is minimal,
it may be enough to greatly reduce disproportionate-share pay-
ments (which are linked to Medicaid volume, not uncompensated
care). These payments have played a critical role in stabilizing the
financial status of high-volume Medicaid hospitals.
Medicare providers. Medicare fiscal pressure may have played a
role in reducing growth in uncompensated care delivery. The tertile
of hospitals that had the lowest gains from Medicare in 1983 pro-
vided uncompensated care that was roughly proportional to their
share of the hospital market in 1983 (accounting for 36 percent of all
uncompensated care and 34 percent of total expenses) but a less-
than-proportionate share in 1994 (28 percent of total expenses but
only 24 percent of total uncompensated care).
Within this set of hospitals that fared the worst under Medicare,
uncompensated care represented roughly the same proportion of
hospital expenses in 1994 as it did in 1983 (5.7 percent and 5.8
percent, respectively). Among less pressured hospitals, uncompen-
sated care as a proportion of hospital expenses grew between 1983
and 1994 (from 5.7 percent to 6.9 percent).
Hospitals in competitive markets. The tertile of hospitals in the
most competitive markets provide the greatest amount of uncom-
pensated care (Exhibit 3). In 1994 they accounted for 54 percent of
hospital business and 61 percent of uncompensated care. Hospitals

NOTES: HMO is health maintenance organization. UC is uncompensated care. HMO penetration was measured only for hospitals
located in MSAs; the sample for the six competition/HMO penetration categories excludes non-MSA hospitals.
in the least competitive markets accounted for a much lower share
of hospital business (22 percent) and an even smaller share of un-
compensated care (18 percent). On average, uncompensated care
accounted for 7.4 percent of expenses among hospitals in the most
competitive markets compared with 5.3 percent in the least com-
petitive markets. Hospitals in the most competitive markets tend to
be in large cities, are bigger in size, have a larger Medicaid mix, and
account for more of the public and major teaching hospitals (charac-
teristics associated with higher levels of uncompensated care).
It is not necessarily competition per se that will induce reduc-
tions in uncompensated care. Rather, it is the combination of com-
petition plus greater price sensitivity introduced by managed care
that could lead to pressures to slow the growth of uncompensated
care. Within each market category (the most and least competitive
tertile of hospitals), we look at differences in uncompensated care
provision associated with differing levels of managed care penetra-
tion (Exhibit 3). The sample is restricted to hospitals in MSAs
(where there are more reliable measures of HMO penetration).
A clear pattern emerges when comparing HMO penetration
within the same type of hospital market structure: The greater the
degree of HMO penetration, the lower the provision of uncompen-
sated care relative to the hospital's size, with the effect being
stronger in the most competitive markets. This can be seen by exam-
ining the ratio of "Share of UC" to "Share of expense," which shows
that all hospitals in the most competitive markets within MSAs
provide a greater than proportionate share of uncompensated care,
but that this contribution is greater among hospitals in areas with
little HMO penetration (a ratio of 1.58 versus 1.15 in areas with the

greatest HMO presence). On average, uncompensated care takes up
a smaller portion of hospital expenses in areas with more extensive
HMO penetration (7.6 percent versus 10.5 percent in more competi-
tive markets and 4.6 percent versus 5.8 percent in less competitive
markets). While a multivariate model should be used to control for
the various determinants of uncompensated care delivery, these bi-
variate results suggest that managed care may indeed lead to pres-
sures to reduce uncompensated care.
Conclusions
Our examination of uncompensated care trends shows that the
level of uncompensated care grew in real terms from 1983 to 1994
and then declined slightly in 1995. The increase in uncompensated
care levels after 1988 appears not to have kept pace with growth in
hospital expenses or the uninsured population. However, the de-
clines in the relative level of effort were fairly modest and do not
suggest a large-scale reduction of effort.
Although changes in uncompensated care have been modest in
the aggregate, there have been significant distributional shifts
among hospitals in two categories: (1) Hospitals serving a large
share of the Medicaid population experienced increases in uncom-
pensated care relative to hospitals with a low Medicaid load; and (2)
hospitals that experienced financial losses in their Medicare busi-
ness reduced uncompensated care levels relative to hospitals with
financial gains under Medicare.
Although it is descriptive, this DataWatch provides suggestive
evidence that higher levels of managed care penetration are associ-
ated with lower levels of uncompensated care delivery, controlling
for hospital market structure. Whether this relationship is attribut-
able to hospitals' cutting back on uncompensated care once man-
aged care firms enter a market or to managed care firms' choosing to
enter those types of markets where uncompensated care is lower to
begin with awaits further multivariate analyses that model these
dynamics over time. Even in the latter case, however, continued
expansion of managed care throughout the country, particularly in
light of the decline in insurance coverage, may undermine the ability
of hospitals to continue to provide uncompensated care.
This DataWatch is based on apresentation at the conference, "What Is Happening to
the Safety Net?," sponsored by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RW]F) in
collaboration with Health Affairs and the Alpha Center, 9-10 January 1997, in
Washington, D.C. The authors thank RWJFforfunding the workpresented here and
Joseph Martin, Peter Kralovec, and Robert Bergmann of the American Hospital
Associationfor their assistance in conducting these analyses.

NOTES
1. R. Bennefield, Health Insurance Coverage--1995, Current Population Reports,
Household Economic Series, P60-195 (Washington: U.S. Census Bureau, Sep-
tember 1996).
2. Because uncompensated care includes both bad debt and charity care, some
portion of uncompensated care is generated by insured patients who are
unable or unwilling to pay the share of costs for which they are responsible.
Inconsistencies across hospitals in the definition and allocation of charity care
versus bad debt make it difficult to precisely identify the amount of charity
care provided.
3. These rate-setting programs, which were implemented in the 1980s, have been
discontinued (except in Maryland).
4. The Medicare and Medicaid DSH programs differ in terms of the magnitude of
total payments, the criteria for identifying DSH hospitals, and the formula for
allocating payments to qualifying hospitals. DSH funding is much greater
under Medicaid than it is under Medicare ($19 billion versus $3.7 billion,
respectively, in 1995).
5. Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, Medicare and theAmerican Health
CareSystem: Report to the Congress (Washington: ProPAC,June 1996).
6. More recently, the pressure from Medicare has eased partly because of pay-
ment increases and partly because of stronger efforts by many hospitals to
control costs.
7. The annual survey reports tax appropriations, but in many cases these funds
support activities other than indigent care. Since there is no direct measure of
subsidies earmarked for indigent care, the measure of uncompensated care
used in this study does not net out indigent care subsidies.
8. The amount of uncompensated care per uninsured person is an admittedly
crude measure, since insured patients as well as uninsured patients generate
uncompensated care. Few studies document the relative proportion of un-
compensated care attributed to insured persons.
9. U.S. Census Bureau, Health Insurance Historical Tables, No. HI-1 (Washington:
U.S. Census Bureau, 2 July 1996); and K.R. Levit, G.L Olin, and S.W. Letsch,
"Americans' Health Insurance Coverage, 1980-91," Health Care Financing Review
(Fall 1992): 31-57.
10. This methodology is described inJ. Zwanziger, G.A. Melnick, andJ.M. Mann,
"Measures of Hospital Market Structure: A Review of the Alternatives and a
Proposed Approach," Socioeconomic Planning Sciences (July 1990): 81-95. Our
previous research found that hospitals' market structure for Medicare patients
was substantially similar to the market for all of their patients (the correlation
was generally greater than 90 percent).
11. Decreases in the amount of uncompensated care per uninsured person may
not represent an actual drop-off in the level of care delivered to the uninsured.
Whether it does or does not depends on how the composition of the unin-
sured population has changed. That the uninsured population continued to
grow through the 1990s despite the Medicaid expansions, the establishment
of high-risk pools to cover the "uninsurable," and the formation of purchasing
alliances to give small employers access to larger risk pools, is attributed to
losses ofemployment-based coverage. SeeJ. Shiels and L. Alecxih, Recentlrends
in Employer Health Insurance Coverage and Benefits, Final Report, prepared for t
American Hospital Association (Fairfax, Va.: The Lewin Group, 3 September
1996). To the extent that employed populations are relatively healthier, it may
be that persons who are uninsured today tend to be healthier than those who
were uninsured eight to ten years ago.
