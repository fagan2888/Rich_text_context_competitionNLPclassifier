s Abstract Population health care is health information and clinical services pro-
vided to individuals of a defined population. From a population health care perspective,
quality of care involves the health status of the entire population, and thus issues
of access, cost of care, and efficiency matter. In this paper, we describe the def-
initions of quality health care and the framework for measuring quality, with em-
phasis on the performance of organizations involved in the delivery and assurance
of population health care. We describe quality measurement sets and systems,
criteria for the choice of measures, data sources, and how quality measurements are
used to improve health care and outcomes from a population health care perspective.
INTRODUCTION
The population health care perspective acknowledges a multidisciplinary approach
to medical care that emphasizes prevention while recognizing the need for effi-
ciency and the consequences of resource allocation decisions (48, 19). The goals
of population health care are achievable only with information on indiviuals, their
health status, and the quality of their medical care. An organization that practices
population health care attempts to maximize the health of individuals in a de-
fined population given available resources and thus shares the perspectives of both
personal health care and public health.
The ultimate goal of measuring quality is to improve health outcomes by stim-
ulating improvements in health care. An increasing recognition of deficiencies in
the quality of health care has spawned interest in making more measurements of
quality as a spur to actions to improve health outcomes (7, 32, 40). The increasing
focus on measuring and improving quality has occurred at the same time that there
has been a demand to demonstrate the value of health care services and to monitor

the performance of insurance companies, managed care organizations, and health
care providers in delivering services.
Inthispaper,wedescribethedefinitionsofqualityhealthcareandtheframework
for measuring quality, with emphasis on the performance of organizations involved
in population health care. We describe quality measurement sets and systems,
criteria for the choice of measures (or indicators) within sets and systems, and
data sources. We also describe how quality measurements are used to improve
health care and outcomes. Throughout, the paper emphasizes the importance of a
population perspective in defining quality and in the choice of quality measures.
POPULATION HEALTH CARE
Population health care is health information and clinical services provided to indi-
viduals of a defined population. In population health care, surveillance occurs and
individuals are targeted for interventions based on known or predicted risk. The
indicators of success are population statistics in the form of quality of care and
organizational performance measures. Population health care can be practiced to
some extent by any entity that delivers or assures the delivery of health services to
a defined group of individuals. These organizations include insurers, whose pop-
ulation is defined according to enrollment; provider systems, whose population is
defined by membership via insurers, corporations, or individual's choice; or by
government providers of care, such as the Veteran's Administration, or payers of
care, such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), whose pop-
ulations are defined by eligibility for services. Organizations that pay for or assure
the delivery of care, such as CMS, have the regulatory or financial capability to
monitor and affect the care of their defined populations. However, by nature of their
organizational structure, integrated health care delivery systems that function as a
unit across health care disciplines (e.g., primary and specialty providers, nurses,
health educators) and settings (e.g., outpatient, inpatient, at home) are currently
most involved in the practice of population health care.
Population health care seeks to maximize the health and well-being of persons
in the defined population given a set of fixed resources and operational constraints.
Organizations voluntarily take on responsibility for population health--it is rarely
imposed externally or mandated contractually. The orientation to populations is in-
dicative of an organization's culture, values, and philosophy of care. Other forces
that motivate population health care include marketplace incentives to provide
more efficient care, the health professions' mission to provide more effective care,
the demands by payers that providers demonstrate the quality of care, and infor-
mation technology (17).
Linkages to Public Health
Several linkages exist between public health and personal health care, such as
the provision of immunizations, cancer screening, and treatment of tuberculosis
POPULATION PERSPECTIVE ON QUALITY 365
(2, 43). Population health care broadens these linkages by expanding personal
health care services to a population level, and thus population health care shares
several features in common with public health. Most important, both seek to main-
tain or enhance health in a defined group. The methods of surveillance developed
in public health are used to monitor the clinical care and health status of persons
in population health care. Each relies on programs that deliver specific services to
achieve the goal of health maintenance and promotion and emphasizes outreach
and prevention. For example, a subpopulation with a high-prevalence condition
such as hypertension can be targeted for prevention services that promote healthy
habits by means such as flyers or posters. Both operate within systems of con-
strained resources and must therefore allocate resources to achieve an optimal
effect. However, unlike public health services, population health care targets in-
dividuals with some common characteristic that selects them, such as enrollment
in a health plan, and not geographic boundaries. Unlike public health, population
health care generally does not attempt to change the physical, social, or economic
environment unless done in cooperation with public health agencies.
Linkages to Personal Health Care: Population
Health Care Management
There is a set of population health care interventions that share much in common
with personal medical care and utilization management. Termed population health
care management, these interventions focus on individual risk assessment, indi-
vidually targeted interventions, and modification of practice patterns. Population

zation beyond the clinician's office by using data and systems to influence both
providers and patients to improve the quality and efficiency of clinical care. For
example, information can be automatiaclly generated for physicians at the time
of a patient visit and can include reminders about overdue screening tests and the
risk of a cardiovascular disease event for persons with diabetes. Organizations that
practice population health care management have access to data and, under favor-
able circumstances, the means to change clinical practice that are often beyond
the reach of public health organizations, less integrated health systems, or small
provider groups.
Measurement and Perspective
Table 1 describes some of the distinguishing characteristics of quality and perfor-

care, and public health. While the primary responsibility in personal health care
is the individual patient, population health care and public health must consider
the maximization of health across individuals. Thus, the latter use epidemiological
methods such as surveillance to explicitly consider costs and target interventions
at groups of people. The performance of health care organizations is also assessed
to inform consumers. Population health care management, as a distinct set of

QUALITY OF CARE AND PERFORMANCE:
CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS
Experts struggled for decades to formulate a single concise, meaningful, and gen-
erally applicable definition of the quality of health care (3). There are now several
commonly cited definitions (9, 12, 28), which differ in their emphasis on quality
of life, the delivery of services, and processes of care as components of quality.
A 1990 definition from the Institute of Medicine, which was arrived at after col-
lecting and considering over 100 definitions of quality from the literature, appears
often in discussions of the quality of medical care. The Institute of Medicine de-
fined quality as "the degree to which health services for individuals and populations
increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current
professional knowledge" (28). This definition is important in the context of this
paper because of its explicit recognition of the population perspective in quality.
POPULATION PERSPECTIVE ON QUALITY 367
Donabedian first suggested that there is more than one legitimate formulation of
quality depending on the system of care and the nature and extent of responsibilities
(11). Blumenthal clarified the relationship between different perspectives and the
definition of quality of care (3). He describes four main perspectives on quality--
the health care professional perspective, the patient perspective, the perspective of
health care plans and organizations, and the purchaser perspective--which lead to
different definitions of quality. Health care providers tend to view quality in terms
of the attributes of care and the results of care, leading to definitions of quality
that emphasize technical excellence and the characteristics of patient/professional
interaction (11, 35). Patients tend to view quality in terms of their own preferences
and values, leading to definitions of quality that encompass satisfaction with care,
as well as outcomes such as morbidity, mortality, and functional status. Health care
plans and organizations that deliver services tend to place greater emphasis on
the general health of the enrolled or covered population and on the function of
the organization (26), leading to a definition of quality that takes into account the
ability of the plan to meet the needs of enrollees. This perspective encompasses
decisions to limit some care to assure essential services for all and acknowledges
the reality of fixed resources. Purchasers, such as health care organizations, tend
to be concerned about population-based measures of quality and organizational
performance (3). The purchaser perspective leads to a definition of quality that is
similartothatofhealthcareorganizations.However,purchasersareveryconcerned
about the "value" of care, and this concern incorporates the price of care and the
efficiency of the delivery of care.
A Population Perspective on Quality and Performance
The distinction between quality and performance measurement is not clear in the
published literature. Performance measurement is the term usually applied when an
organization is being assessed (as opposed to a hospital or an individual) and when
access, cost, and efficiency are being assessed as a component of quality. Org-
anizational performance measures from a population health perspective are more
encompassing than indicators typically encountered in personal health care quality
assessment, where the focus is on the individual patient-provider interaction.
Performance measures of cost and efficiency include, for example, the number
of people a diabetes education program serves and the cost per service. These are
also considered to be measures of utilization and can be unrelated to the quality of
care of individuals. However, a large amount of resources for an education program
that reaches few persons with diabetes might dictate a new approach to outreach
or referral or a redirection of resources to prevention. From a population health
care perspective, performance measures include indicators of access to care (e.g.,
waiting time for an appointment, outreach educational letters) because the entire
population, and not just those who receive care, is of concern. Other types of per-
formance indicators especially relevant from a population health care perspective
include measures of the effectiveness of prevention and patient-centered measures
of risk behavior (19). Examples include the proportion of persons in a population
368 DEROSE PETITTI
with obesity, the proportion of persons in a population who smoke, and the propor-
tion of a health plan's established members who have newly diagnosed diabetes.
MEASURING QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
Quality of care must be objectively measured to be useful in crafting strategies
for improving health. The alternative is subjective judgments and thus unclear
evidence to guide decisions. Organizations must objectively measure performance
to engage in successful performance improvement since systems and providers can
be held accountable only for things that are measured. Thus, discussions of quality
of care and performance quickly transition to discussions of ways to measure
quality and performance.
Structure, Process, Outcome
Quality of care can be measured based on structure, process, or outcome (12­14).
Structural measures are the characteristics of the resources in the health system
(e.g., the number of beds in a hospital, the number of registered nurses per patient
in the intensive care unit). Processes embody what is done to and for a person (e.g.,
immunization, prescription for a medication, recommendation to cease smoking).
Outcomes are the end results of care or the effect of the care process on the health
and well-being of patients and populations (e.g, death, satisfaction with care, health
status). Implicit in the use of structure and process to measure quality is a link to
outcomes.
Structure, process, and outcome measures all can provide valid information
about the quality of health care (4, 5, 12, 28). Organizational structure may be a root
causeofseveraldownstreamqualityproblemsandcriticaltothesuccessofprovider
organizations. The main advantage of structural measures of quality is their relative
ease of measurement. The disadvantage is the often indirect link between the
structural variable and desired outcome. For example, staffing of intensive care
unitswithphysicianstrainedasintensivistsisbeingusedasaperformanceindicator
by the Pacific Business Group on Health, a consortium of insurance purchasers
operating in California. The explicit purpose of this staffing pattern is to improve
the outcome of patients cared for in an intensive care unit. There is some empiric
evidence of a correlation between staffing and better outcome. But the link between
staffing and better outcome clearly is indirect--it must be the things that are done
by the intensivist or a system or institution that uses intensivists and not strictly
the presence of the intensivist that improves outcome.
Process measures are appealing to providers because they are directly related
to what providers do. They are actionable, often pointing directly to areas where
care needs to be improved. The appeal of a measure to providers is critical because
changes in what providers do and say often determines the success or the failure of
efforts to change outcomes. However, there are several arguments against process
measures as measures of quality of care. Processes are not necessarily important
predictors of outcome, and directing resources at processes that do not affect
POPULATION PERSPECTIVE ON QUALITY 369
outcomes may increase health care costs without producing health improvements
(16). It may be difficult to achieve consensus on the correct process for many
clinical problems, especially when the evidence-base is poor.
Outcome measures also appeal intuitively to providers and can also be used
to target quality improvement efforts. But some outcomes (e.g., cancer mortality)
are rare and thus comparisons of quality based on rare outcomes are often of low
statistical power (4). Many outcomes are not under the control of the health care
providers, and conclusions about the quality of care based on them may be invalid.
Moreover, it may be difficult to assign responsibility for outcomes to a single
provider or a system of care when there are no clear points of entry or exit to the
health care system (28). For example, a case of hepatitis B in an adult member
of a health care organization might occur because of failure of the pediatrician in
another organization to vaccinate appropriately during infancy.
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SETS AND SYSTEMS
A performance measurement set or system is an "interrelated set of process and/or
outcome measures that facilitate internal and external comparisons of an organi-
zation's performance over time" (27). Specific performance measurements within
a set measure the quality of care or some other desired attribute of care delivery
(i.e., access, efficiency).
Performance measurements sets are developed by regulatory bodies, such as
state and federal governments; agencies that accredit health care organizations,
such as the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
(JCAHO); voluntary organizations representing disease constituencies, such as the
American Diabetes Association; professional societies, such as the American Col-
lege of Cardiology; and organizations that themselves deliver health care services.
The motivation for developing measurement sets is generally the same for each
type of organization involved in developing them--to define quality and drive its
improvement and to create accountability for demonstrating and improving quality.
Quality measures are used for accreditation of institutions, to provide accountabil-
ity to payers of care, to educate consumers, for internal quality improvement, and
for research into care delivery.
There are several measurement systems for evaluation and comparison of hos-
pital care (27). A set of quality indicators developed specifically for use with
hospital discharge abstract data have been developed in the Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project (HCUP). JCAHO has recently begun to require reporting of
some measures of quality and outcome and to take performance on these measures
into account in making decisions about accreditation. To the extent that persons
hospitalized for a given condition constitute a population, the JCAHO measures
are indicators of population health care performance.
The Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS®), first estab-
lished in 1991, is a performance measurement system (8) that has been used by
the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) to compare the quality of
370 DEROSE PETITTI
care of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). HEDIS® measures have been
extended to other kinds of insurance schemes. Medicare and Medicaid require re-
porting of HEDIS® measures separately for beneficiaries in HMOs. Table 2 shows
topic items under two types of HEDIS® measures, "effectiveness of care" and
"access/availability of care," which are selected from the 2001 HEDIS® measure-
ment set (33). To follow these HEDIS® topics, a potential measure of childhood
immunization status is the proportion of children who have had all immunizations
recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics by 24 months of age. An-
other potential measure, of breast cancer screening, is the proportion of women
age 50 years and older who have had a mammogram in the past two years. These
measures qualify as population health care measures. HEDIS® performance is con-
sidered in decisions of NCQA to accredit health plans. HEDIS® scores form the
basis for report cards, which are widely publicized for the use of consumers and
organizations in choosing a health plan.
Performance measurements to be used in public health settings have also been
developed (10, 23, 36), and a national initiative is under way to assess local and
state public health system quality (39). Many states and localities have developed
or conducted performance assessment (29), although internal, quantitative quality
assessment in local health departments is not yet routine.

CHOOSING QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Different perspectives and definitions of quality, as described above, call for dif-
ferent approaches to quality measurement (11). It is helpful to clarify the purpose
of measurement in order to guide the selection and development of measures. We
focus our discussion here on the purposes of organizations involved in population
health care. Measures are chosen or developed for internal performance improve-
ment by provider organizations. Measures for accreditation or external reporting
aredevelopedbyagenciesthatassurecaredelivery,suchasNCQA.Manymeasures
can be used for both purposes.
Measures of population health care inevitably involve consideration of data
resources. Measures developed by care providers may emphasize operational con-
straints and the organization's capacity to effect change, and may include perfor-
mance indicators that are specific to the care delivery system and the problems
facing the population or the organization. Population health care measures devel-
oped by agencies that assure care delivery must be applicable across a wide variety
of settings.
The quality of clinical care for populations is generally assessed by either
process or outcome measures, since structural quality measures are the most distant
from outcomes and have their effect through changes in processes. Organizational
systems performance also can be assessed by carefully considered measures of
utilization (such as hospitalization rates among diabetics), access to care (such
as waiting time for a mental health appointment), and time-efficiency (such as
the turn-around time for medical test reports). The meaning of these measures
must be carefully considered because they can be dissociated from quality (e.g.,
high quality may exist with either high or low utilization) or have a complex
relationship to quality. For example, there might be an optimal range for number of
physicians and the size of their patient panels that preserve organizational viability
in a competitive marketplace (having fewer physicians and larger panels) while not
reducing needed access to care (having more physicians and smaller panels) and
not encouraging medical errors due to time constraints (having smaller panels).
Although perfect measures and measurement systems do not exist, more or less
useful measures do. Several criteria are helpful to guide the choice of performance
measures. These criteria (e.g., meaningfulness or relevance, feasibility, actionabil-
ity, reliability, validity) have been expressed in a variety of ways in published
sources, but all revolve around similar key concepts (15, 30, 31, 36). Key issues
for measuring quality and performance from a population health care perspective
are discussed below.
Topic Areas for Measurement
Organizations providing or assuring the quality of population health care will chose
topic areas for measurement where a potential exists to significantly improve heath-
related quality of life and decrease morbidity and mortality among members of the
defined population. An assessment of the cost effectivness of care associated with
372 DEROSE PETITTI
a potential topic area will help determine its relative importance for measurement.
One starting place for identifying areas of importance for quality assessment and
improvementisthehealthcaregoalsdefinedbyHealthyPeople2010(34)andmany
complementaty plans by state and local health agencies. These goals are chosen
to improve the quality and length of life, as well as decrease health disparities,
in the U.S. population. Specific population subgroups may have needs that differ
from the entire U.S. population. National data sources, such as the Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report and publications from the National Center for Health
Statistics (both under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), provide
geographically based population health information. Information on members of
a health plan is often available from electronic administrative and clinical care
databases and can include causes of mortality, morbidity, and utilization. Using
sources such as these, the significance of the conditions and risk factors (such as
smoking) on morbidity, mortality, and health resource use can be estimated for a
defined population (30).
Evidence Base
Measures are most successful in driving improvements in care when the actions
they represent are evidence-based (or have a clear, logical link to outcomes). For
example, a performance measure for diabetes care that is based on data from
well-conducted randomized trials (e.g., use of ACE-inhibitors in diabetic patients
with microalbuminuria) is a better candidate for successful quality improvement
interventions than measures based on currently weaker evidence, such as screen-
ing everyone with hypertension for chronic kidney disease. In recent years, the
evidence base with which to make personal health care decisions has received
increasing emphasis. During the latter half of the twentieth century, randomized
controlled trials became the standard of medical knowledge, and systematic re-
views that synthesize the results of multiple scientific investigations have grown
in influence (7).
The evidence base for population health care is essentially the evidence base
for personal health care, rather than a combination of personal and public health
evidence. As the evidence base for public health becomes more established (45),
and if cooperation between public health agencies and health plans grows, the
public health evidence base likely will gain influence on the practice of population
health care.
Population health care management applies the generalizable results of scien-
tific studies to estimate the risks an individual faces and the benefits of interventions
to modify those risks--the traditional domain of the health care professional. A
wealth of evidence exists to support important population health care interventions.
For example, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Study (HOPE) provides strong evi-
dence for the beneficial effect of angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
in persons with diabetes over the age of 55 years and who have cardiovascular dis-
ease or another established cardiovascular risk factor (20). On the basis of this
POPULATION PERSPECTIVE ON QUALITY 373
evidence, patients who satisfy these criteria but are not on the recommended med-
ication can be identified, and information or prompts to action for physicians
or patients can be delivered. For example, a specific intervention used at Kaiser
Permanente Southern California is a computer-generated datasheet for scheduled
appointments that lists medications, relevant lab data, other useful information,
and specific recommendations for care that are evidence-based, tailored to the in-
dividual patient (e.g., ACE inhibitor by HOPE study criteria, as described above),
and easy for providers to act upon at the point of service to the patient.
For clinical quality improvement, it is helpful to clarify the objectives and pro-
cess of care. Evidence-based guidelines that explicitly state actions for specific
objectives can help define performance measures and provide a model for improv-
ing the process of care. Rigorously developed guidelines, such as those of the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force (47), are an excellent source of information. How-
ever, the evidence base, and guidelines produced from evidence, are necessary but
not sufficient for identifying measures that have the potential to improve quality.
Actionability
Actionability--the ability of resources applied by the health care provider or sys-
tem to significantly affect the measure--is also an important consideration in
choosing measures that can be used to drive performance improvement. For ex-
ample, computerized reminders to physicians at the time of an appointment have
the potential to produce improvements in routinely scheduled services, such as
cancer screening tests (41) or monitoring tests for a person with diabetes (e.g.,
LDL, HgbA1c). Providers and managers are much more supportive of proposed
measures when change for the better is possible. Measures may also be more ac-
tionable when supported by other stakeholders, such as payers of care (business,
the government), or patients, whose preferences provide justification for additional
resource diversion into the area of concern.
An example of an actionable measure, developed by the Picker Institute (38) for
assessing hospital care, is "Were you given enough privacy when discussing your
condition or treatment?" The responses are "Yes, always," "Yes, sometimes," and
"No." This type of question can lead directly to actions that improve care. Compare
this to a common type of satisfaction measure, "How satisfied are you with your
pain management?" with a five-point response from "Very dissatisfied" to "Very
satisfied," and it is obvious that the latter measure is not readily actionable because
reasons for the level of satisfaction are not specified by the question.
High levels of performance sometimes can be associated with diminishing
returns for increasing costs, or a level can be reached at which the cost associ-
ated with achieving better performance in one area may negatively affect quality
in other areas. For example, resources may be better used to screen previously
untested members for cervical cancer than to increase the return rate for repeat
mammography screening. These considerations affect resource distribution and
the actionability of measures.
374 DEROSE PETITTI
STANDARDIZATION AND AUDIT OF QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES
When comparing the performance of organizations or providers, it is essential that
any differences in the measurements are not due to differences in measurement
methodology and thus permit valid conclusions about variations among the units
being compared. The validity of comparisons is achieved by standardization of the
methods for making the measures. This is done by provision of detailed rules for
data collection and reporting and development of protocols for collecting data for
the measures. These descriptions and protocols are called "specifications." Table 3
gives example specifications for three measures from a diabetes measurement
set used to compare performance across Kaiser Permanente. Kaiser Permanente
is America's largest not-for-profit health maintenance organization, serving 8.1
million members, including approximately 380,000 members with diabetes, at 29
medical centers in nine states.
Valid conclusions about time trends in performance requires that the method-
ology for the measure be stable over time. Changes in the definitions of numerator
or denominator for a clinical performance measure will change the measure. In
addition, changes in the accuracy or completeness of the data that generate the
measure can affect trendability. For example, improvements in the recording of
immunizations in health plan medical records of immunizations received outside
the health plan would results in an improvement in a measure that is not accurately
indicative of improvement in the quality of care, only improvements in the quality
of the data.
Quality and performance measurements in some performance sets are subject
to routine audit by external agencies. Audit is especially likely when the measures
will be publicly reported and might affect decisions of individuals or organizations
to purchase or pay for health care from the reporting organizations. For example,
HEDIS® clinicalmeasuresareauditedbyalargeaccountingfirmandonlymeasures
that pass the audit can be publicly reported.
DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY
Computer-Stored Administrative and Clinical Data
It is attractive to use already collected computer-stored data for quality and perfor-
mance measures because there are no costs associated with collecting these data,
the data are easily accessible, the number of people or events included in many
databases is large, and the data are often "population-based."
Computer-stored data available to health systems can be divided broadly into
two categories--administrative data and clinical data. Administrative data are col-
lected for business purposes and include information collected at the time of enroll-
ment or premiums/dues payment (e.g., name, address, date of birth, social security
number) and information used for billing and claims processing (e.g., dates

medical records. There is overlap, and some data collected mainly for adminis-
trative purposes have clinical uses. For example, data from prescriptions may be
computer stored to facilitate administrative functions such as refills and drug cost-
accounting, but the information may also be used clinically to manage patients.
For many types of computer-stored data, there is no clear distinction between ad-
ministrative and clinical uses. For example, the use of hospital discharge data used
to monitor hospital discharges for procedures is both administrative and clinical.
Computer-stored data collected strictly for administrative reasons generally do
not contain clinical detail (see Table 4). The accuracy of both computer-stored
administrative and clinical data is uncertain until evaluated because of the cir-
cumstances under which the data are collected. Data in both computer-stored
administrative and clinical databases may not be complete. Data fields (e.g., birth
date, race/ethnicity) may be missing in a membership database. Information on
services received outside the system may not be captured. For example, influenza
shots given at a community clinic may not be recorded in a health plan's immu-
nization database. Prescriptions filled in the local drugstore will not be recorded in
the prescription database. Other well-recognized limitations associated with coded
data from hospital discharges and ambulatory visits include imprecise coding of
diagnoses and procedures, lack of specificity of codes, undercoding of comor-
bidities and complications, and different levels of coding completeness across
institutions. All of the sources of inaccuracy and incompleteness affect the useful-
ness of computer-stored data for quality and performance measurement and the
validity of conclusions based on the measure.

identifiers are not shared. Moreover, it may be difficult for health plans to assess
the accuracy of data external to their systems, and data like those on mortality can
be delayed up to a year.
Medical Records
Medical records, both paper and electronic, are an important source of information
for performance measurement. Information from the medical records may be the
sole basis for a performance measure or it can be used to supplement computer-
stored data. For example, the accuracy of a measure of beta-blocker use after acute
myocardial infarction as a measure of quality could be improved by reviewing the
paper charts or the electronic medical records of people who did not receive a beta-
blocker to determine whether this is because of a contraindication to beta-blocker
use.
Medical records, both paper and electronic, are not good sources of data on mor-
tality outcomes, functional status, or patient satisfaction unless special attention
has been placed on collecting such information in the course of clinical practice.
Medical records may not themselves be complete. For example, the contraindica-
tion to beta-blocker use may not be recorded in the medical record. Finally, there
is almost never a protocol for the recording of information in a medical record.
Providers may differ in their threshold for recording whether the patient had a
comorbid condition or may use different criteria to make a diagnosis.
Patient Report
Statements from individuals about care or about their perceptions are another
source of information on processes and outcomes. They are the only source of
data on satisfaction with care and most measures of functional status. Performance
measurement based on reports from individuals can be costly when based on
surveys of large populations.
All surveys are subject to bias due to nonresponse. Nonresponse tends to be
high in surveys done for measurement of the quality of care. For example, in
Kaiser Permanente, the Picker Institute survey of hospital performance (18, 38)
had a response rate of 40%, and an internal survey of satisfaction with pregnancy
and newborn care had a response rate of 33% (25). Little work has been done to
determine whether respondents to surveys of the quality of care are representative.
Finally, problems exist with the accuracy of self-reported data. Patients do not
always accurately report their receipt of services. For preventive services, there is a
tendency to "telescope," reporting receipt of services more recently than they were
actually performed (44). Some individuals may not know which services they have
received. A person may, for example, know that they had a "shot" but they do
not whether the shot was for influenza or pneumococcal pneumonia. Consumer
satisfaction ratings may not always be reliable indicators of quality because con-
sumers cannot always deem whether services are appropriate or technically good
(1), and the ratings may not reflect the outcome for the entire population at risk
378 DEROSE PETITTI
(e.g., a patient with a contagious disease may dislike a treatment program even
though it is beneficial to the patient and others).
MEASUREMENT TO IMPROVE POPULATION HEALTH
Population health care is dependent on performance measures to objectively assess
the effectiveness of its programs. In clinical medicine, one-on-one patient-provider
contact and individual test results are used to judge the status and progress of
patients. In population health care, individuals are risk-assessed and interventions
prompted, but the measures of success are population statistics. Success is judged
by comparisons with past performance, benchmarks, or the performance of similar
organizations.
Population health care measures generally do not delve into the mechanism
of action of complex care interventions, such as the diverse effects of a self-care
educational program for a chronic disease. Detailed analysis of such interventions
is the realm of program evaluation. Rather, the receipt of services, the immediate
results they produce, and ultimate outcomes are monitored over time. Performance
measures thus point toward opportunities for improving care. Since it is imprac-
tical to measure all aspects of care, even by rotating measures periodically into
and out of use, performance measures cannot reveal every reason for a given level
of performance. For that, subject matter knowledge and creativity are required to
extract information that is useful for performance improvement. For example, if
satisfaction with sexually transmitted disease and birth control counseling services
is low among teens, then use of these services may decline and disease or unin-
tended pregnancies may result. Efforts should be made to understand the reasons
for low satisfaction, such as fear of an overly visible waiting area, so that corrective
measures can be taken and result in improved performance.
Invalid conclusions can sometimes be drawn from measures that are not fully
interpretable without understanding data limitations, potential confounding fac-
tors (i.e., covariates), and what constitutes good performance. For example, an
influenza outbreak can significantly change hospitalization rates among diabetics,
but without that knowledge, an increase in rates might be attributed to a variety
of reasons, and may not include a discussion of rates of influenza immunization.
Thus, the users of performance results need to be educated about the limits and
interpretation of results.
Organizational Conditions for Performance Improvement
For performance measures to have an effect on performance improvement, clear
objectivesmustexist,andtheremustbeaninfrastructureofindividualswithsubject
matter knowledge and an ability to change the system of care. Objectives are often
chosen that require a strong effort but are potentially achievable, with an idealized
goal in mind. For example, a goal for breast cancer screening might be to maximize
mammography rates among eligible women, recognizing that there will always be
POPULATION PERSPECTIVE ON QUALITY 379
members who chose not to be screened or continually defer making a conscious
choice even after appropriate outreach is made. The objective for a given period
of time might be to raise the absolute screening rate from 75% to 85% after
considering the current rate, what screening rate is potentially achievable given
the resources at hand, and the opportunity costs involved.
The question of what organizational structure will achieve the best results is
not well understood and may depend on the organization's mission, culture, lead-
ership, resources, and accountabilities. Integrated health systems with hospitals,
clinics, primary care, specialty care, comprehensive data systems, and a focus on
prevention are clearly in a position of strength to act on and alter care relative to
other organizations that are more fractionated, have less access to comprehensive
data, and focus less on the long term. In addition, accountability to shareholders
or the needs of one large payer may limit an organization's response to prob-
lems regarding current and future performance by focusing improvement only on
publicly reportable performance measures or a subpopulation of their member-
ship. Population health care is focused on risk reduction and therefore is more
likely to be practiced by organizations with a long-term, broad view of health
care.
There is no question that health professionals who understand medical evidence
and ways to create changes in the care delivery system are needed to accomplish
continuous, positive change within any provider system. Such experts should work
within an organizational structure that supports both creativity and the reaching of
consensus, the authority to overcome stasis and take action, and the responsibility
to monitor and be accountable for results. One example is a model employed at
Kaiser Permanente Southern California, in which lead physicians, nurses, pharma-
cists, educators, and others form teams in each of several areas served by a Kaiser
Foundation Health Plan medical center. These teams meet periodically to com-
pare performance across sites, discuss programs in place, identify problems and
opportunities for improvement, brainstorm solutions, plan a response, and monitor
the results in a continuous cycle. Because the members are leaders within their
clinical areas (e.g., diabetes care), and the organizational culture to support this
approach exists, they are able to create positive changes in this large and complex
health care system. For example, with a host of interventions employed for dia-
betes care, improvements in several measures of screening for dyslipidemia and
microalbuminuria, and therapy for dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia, were seen
over several years, and are believed to be largely due to performance monitoring,
feedback, and multifaceted population health interventions, rather than simply
due to changes in practice patterns over time (22). A longstanding and success-
ful population-based approach to chronic illness care and prevention has been
described at Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound (19, 46, 48).
Performance feedback, at a group or individual provider level, is one method
of creating change (24, 37, 49). Sometimes, incentives accompany performance
(21). Using the method of feedback, the details of change are often left to the
provider groups whose performance is assessed. Although engaging providers by
380 DEROSE PETITTI
feedback or incentives may be an important incitement to change, additional meth-
ods exist in integrated delivery systems. These other methods include population
health care management programs that assist providers to perform better and more
easily by removing aspects of care delivery, such as tedious chart reviews for test
data, scheduling routine care, or making health education referrals. Computerized
reminders of individually tailored prevention services or of drug interactions, tar-
geted to providers or patients, are an example of systems used to reduce workload,
overcome human error, and improve performance.
IMPROVING MEASURES, MEASUREMENT SETS,
AND HEALTH SYSTEMS
There are many dozens of organizations and entities that are or want to be involved
in creating measures of quality and performance. There are hundreds, if not thou-
sands, of measures of quality and performance that could be and are proposed.
Increasingly, entities such as purchasers are asking for performance measures that
pertain only to their own employees.
The panoply of measures and parties involved in defining quality measures cre-
ates an increasing burden for health systems that must produce the data that are
used in measurement. The volume of work and the amount of resources that would
be required to meet all of the requests for all of the measures that have been or
are in development are staggering. More important, even if data were available for
every measure, systems would not be able to act on all areas of performance assess-
ment simultaneously. The measures need to be prioritized. Nationally standardized
population health care measures--process, outcomes, and efficiency--that allow
benchmarking and comparisons across health systems are preferrable to multiple,
independent, and incongruous indicator sets.
Major changes in measurement specifications too often occur and result in mea-
sures that are untrendable. In the absence of trendability, the effect of changes made
to improve performance cannot be assessed. Entities that promulgate measurement
specifications would enhance the impact of the measures on care if the importance
of trendability were better appreciated and the effect of changes in specifications
on trendability were better recognized.
PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION
The Federal Privacy Rule, promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (6), will undoubtedly affect the use of popu-
lation health care measures because these measures are made up of protected
health information. For health care operations, including population-based activi-
ties relating to improving health or reducing health care costs, where the data are
held within the provider organization that collected them, no prior consent from
POPULATION PERSPECTIVE ON QUALITY 381
members or tracking of data accessions is required. When individual-level pro-
tected de-identified health data are released to another organization, consent and
tracking data accessions are again not required. It seems unlikely that identified
protected health information would be required for summary measures moni-
tored by external organizations or reported to the public. However, the collection
andpreparationofidentifiedorpotentiallyidentifiablehealthdata,whenperformed
for external reporting, will require the additional privacy safeguards described in
HIPAA, including patient consent or waiver of consent by an institutional review
board, on-site de-identification of data, and special business contracts that provide
assurances of data privacy when external organizations collect or prepare iden-
tifiable data held by providers. By April 2003, full compliance with HIPAA is
required.
CONCLUSION
Population health care is a movement toward a population orientation among or-
ganizations providing or assuring personal health care services. The perspective of
these organizations is to consider the health and welfare of their entire population.
Providers, in particular, must consider how the resources at their disposal can be
brought to bear to create a health return on investment. Performance, in terms of
health status, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, receives great emphasis. Measures
of performance, whether for internal quality improvement or external reporting,
are measures of success.
As information technology improves and disseminates, more useful measures
will become possible at reasonable cost, but efforts still must be made to obtain
meaningful, valid, reliable, and actionable measures if clinical quality is to be
improved. The adoption of performance measures--many of them standardized--
by many organizations has increased the capacity for research on organizational
systems and quality. Although unbiased comparisons are difficult across health
systems, this avenue of systems research has the potential for large gains in the
quality of medical services (7). In addition, the compilation of data by large health
plans on populations that lie within the jurisdictions of state and local health
departments suggests that data sharing for specific purposes (e.g., immunization
rate tracking) might assist community health planning and, ultimately, general
population health outcomes. Data sharing has been described as one attribute of a
socially responsible HMO (42).
Population health care management, when practiced with clinical goals in mind,
is an exciting area for clinical quality improvement. These programs use a team
approach and resources not readily available during the doctor-patient interaction
to extend the clinical reach of the provider organization. Increased opportunities for
improving access to care, identifying and preventing medical errors, and applying
risk-appropriate screening and treatment services are created for patients when
population health care is layered over traditional clinical practice.
