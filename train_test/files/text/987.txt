motorized transportation and obesity in China. Obes Res.
2002;10:277­283.
Objective: Dependence on motorized forms of transporta-
tion may contribute to the worldwide obesity epidemic.
Shifts in transportation patterns occurring in China provide
an ideal opportunity to study the association between vehi-
cle ownership and obesity. Our objective was to determine
whether motorized forms of transportation promote obesity.
Research Methods and Procedures: A multistage random-
cluster sampling process was used to select households from
eight provinces in China. Data were included on household
vehicle ownership and individual anthropometric and socio-
demographic status. Cross-sectional data (1997) from 4741
Chinese adults aged 20 to 55 years were used to explore the
association between vehicle ownership and obesity. Cohort
data (1989 to 1997) from 2485 adults aged 20 to 45 years in
1989 (59% follow-up) were used to measure the impact of
vehicle acquisition on the odds of becoming obese.
Results: Our main outcome measure was current obesity
status and the odds of becoming obese over an 8-year
period. In 1997, 84% of adults did not own motorized
transportation. However, the odds of being obese were 80%
higher (p  0.05) for men and women in households who
owned a motorized vehicle compared with those who did
not own a vehicle. Fourteen percent of households acquired
a motorized vehicle between 1989 and 1997. Compared
with those whose vehicle ownership did not change, men
who acquired a vehicle experienced a 1.8-kg greater weight
gain (p  0.05) and had 2 to 1 odds of becoming obese.
Discussion: Encouraging active forms of transportation
may be one way to protect against obesity.
Key words: China, motorized transportation, weight
gain
Introduction
Inactivity is associated with a range of adverse health
outcomes, not the least of which is obesity. In the United
States, an increase in the prevalence of overweight in both
children and adults has continued unabated over the last two
or three decades (1,2), and recent data suggest over 10% of
children and 50% of adults are overweight (3). The direct
economic cost of illness in the U.S. due to lack of physical
activity has been conservatively estimated at 24 billion
dollars and the cost of obesity at 70 million dollars (4).
Moreover, obesity is second only to smoking as a contrib-
utor to mortality (5).
Advances in technology and transportation are consid-
ered key explanations for greater inactivity in the population
(6). Labor-saving devices have eliminated many of the
back-breaking tasks of agricultural- and industrial-sector
occupations and reduced the time it takes to complete them
(7). These occupational sectors have also shrunk in size,
with more people working in service industry occupations
(8). Occupations in this sector tend to be sedentary, pro-
moting weight gain (9). Technology has also created oppor-
tunity for increasingly sedentary leisure time. For example,
television viewing has been associated with an increase in
the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. and the United King-
dom (10,11). Dependence on motorized forms of transpor-
tation is also likely to have increased inactivity by reducing
the need for more active forms of transportation. However,
despite a growing emphasis on altering land use and trans-
port systems to encourage physical activity (12­14), evi-
dence implicating changes from active to passive forms of
transportation as a cause of obesity is difficult to find. One
reason is that in affluent countries there is virtually no
variation in the type of transportation used. In the U.S., 86%
of all person trips are by private motorized vehicle and

ownership is well over 60% (15,16). Conversely, in China,
data from 1997 indicate that only 16% of households owned
motorized forms of transportation and economics, city de-
sign, and land use limit the personal choice involved in
vehicle ownership. This offers an ideal opportunity to de-
termine whether motorized forms of transportation promote
obesity, and if so, to encourage continued dependence on
active forms of transportation as an effective obesity pre-
vention strategy.
Research Methods and Procedures
The China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) is a
longitudinal survey of health and nutrition in China, con-
ducted jointly by the China Academy of Preventive Medi-
cine and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The initial survey was in 1989 and included eight provinces
(Shangdong, Jiangsu, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Guizhou,
Guangxi, and Liaoning). Follow-up surveys were conducted
in 1991, 1993, and 1997, although the Liaoning province
did not participate in the 1997 survey. The survey is not
nationally representative, but the provinces vary consider-
ably in geography, stage of economic development, and health
status. This variation was achieved using a multistage, random-
cluster sampling process. Four counties were selected within
each of the above provinces. Within each county or urban area,
neighborhoods were randomly selected from suburbs, town-
ships, and villages. Twenty randomly selected households
were targeted within each neighborhood. Health workers vis-
ited each survey household with questionnaires on sociodemo-
graphics, health, and nutrition that were directed at both the
household and individual level. Further details about the
CHNS have been published (17).
Cross-sectional survey respondents included 5247 of
6180 (85%) nonpregnant adults aged 20 to 55 years from
the 1997 survey. Five hundred and six participants were
excluded because they were missing energy-intake or work-
related physical-activity data, which left a sample of 4741.
The questions were asked as part of a 3-day dietary recall
that was separate from the main survey questionnaire and
had a higher respondent burden. We also followed a cohort
of 2485 individuals from 1989 to 1997, representing 59% of
4213 nonpregnant adults aged 20 to 45 years who had
weight and height data collected at baseline. Those lost to
follow-up did not differ to those remaining in the study with
respect to the primary outcome (weight status) or to the
exposure (vehicle ownership). However, they were signifi-
cantly more likely to be male, reside in an urban area, and
be in the highest third of income. They were also younger.
Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) 25
kg/m2, in accordance with new weight status cut-offs for
Asian populations proposed by the International Obesity
Taskforce and the World Health Organization (18). This is
considerably lower that the definition used for the U.S.
population (BMI  30 kg/m2). Height was measured with-
out shoes to the nearest 0.2 cm, using a portable stadiom-
eter. Weight was measured without shoes and with light
clothing to the nearest 0.1 kg, using a calibrated beam scale.
High waist circumference was defined at 90 cm for men
and 80 cm for women (18). Waist circumference was not
measured in 1989. Vehicle ownership was defined at the
household level based on four categories: no vehicle, non-
motorized vehicle only (bicycles and tricycles), motorized
vehicle only (motorcycles and cars), and both motorized and
nonmotorized vehicles. Questions on work-related physical
activity were used to create a three-level work-related ac-
tivity variable: light (e.g., receptionist), moderate (e.g., elec-
trician), and heavy (e.g., farmer). In the 1997 survey, ques-
tions on five categories of leisure-time activity (martial
arts, dance, team sports, jogging/swimming, and court
sports) were used to create a binary variable based on
whether or not an individual participated in one of these
activities at least 12 times in the previous year. Dietary-
intake data were collected by nutritionists using 24-hour
recalls collected over 3 consecutive days, and condiments
and added oils were measured and weighed over the same
days. A weekend day was not necessarily included.
Daily-energy intake and fat intake were calculated using
1991 Chinese Food Composition Tables.
In the cross-sectional analysis, differences in the odds of
being obese according to vehicle ownership were calculated
in Stata (Version 7.0; Stata Corp., College Station, TX)
using generalized estimation equations (GEE). We assumed
a binomial distribution and used a logit link function and an
exchangeable working correlation matrix. Clustering by
household was accounted for in the model and we adjusted
for age (continuous in the range 20 to 55 years), work (light,
moderate, heavy), leisure activity (participation in at least
one of five activities such as martial arts), energy intake
(kilocalories, continuous), smoking status (smoker, ex-
smoker, or nonsmoker), alcohol consumption in the past
year (yes/no), per capita income (low, medium, high) with
the income deflated to 1.0 for rural Liaoning province for
1988, educational attainment (primary, secondary, tertiary),
household ownership of a computer (yes/no) and TV (yes/
no), and urban or rural residence. In the cohort analysis,
differences in the odds of becoming obese according to the
acquisition of a motorized vehicle were calculated using the
same method, but for this analysis we adjusted for baseline
age, weight, education, urban residence, and change in
work-related activity (i.e., heavy to moderate), energy in-
take, smoking status, alcohol consumption, income, and
television ownership. Alternative models were run where
energy intake was divided into fat and nonfat components to
determine the specific impact of dietary fat (not shown).
Dietary fat was an important contributor to weight gain and
obesity, but it did not confound the association between
vehicle ownership and these outcomes differently from
models where energy was not partitioned.

Results
In 1997, only 16% of households in China had motorized
transportation. Two-thirds of households had nonmotorized
forms of transportation and 16% had no vehicles (Table 1).
As the mode of transportation shifted from walking (no
vehicle) to cycling to driving, BMI (p for trend  0.001)
and waist circumference (p for trend  0.001) increased.
Declines in daily-energy intake and heavy work-related
physical activity accompanied this trend, as did increases in
fat intake, income, tertiary education, leisure-time activity,
computer and TV ownership, and urban residence (p for
trend  0.001 in each case). Those who exclusively owned
motorized transportation were a small but unique group that
we do not discuss further but include in our models.
Household ownership of a motorized vehicle was asso-
ciated with greater odds of prevalent obesity in men and
women and a high (90 cm) waist circumference in men
(Figure 1). We adjusted for age, work and leisure activity,
energy intake, smoking status, alcohol consumption, in-
come, education, household ownership of a computer and
TV, and urban residence and found the odds of being obese
were 70% greater [odds ratio, (OR) 1.70; 95% CI, 1.08 to
2.67] in men and 85% greater in women (OR, 1.85; 95% CI,
1.21 to 2.81) compared with those who did not own a
vehicle. Women from households that owned nonmotorized

forms of transportation also had higher odds of prevalent
obesity (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.09), and household
ownership of motorized transportation was associated with
2 to 1 odds for high waist circumference in men (OR, 2.03;
95% CI, 1.24 to 3.34).
These cross-sectional observations are suggestive of an
important positive association between vehicle ownership
and obesity, but they are not helpful for indicating causality.
To clarify this issue, we investigated how the acquisition of
a motorized vehicle influenced the odds of weight gain and
becoming obese.
Thirteen percent of households acquired a motorized ve-
hicle over the 8-year period from 1989 to 1997 (Table 2).
Men from households that acquired a motorized vehicle
(107 participants) experienced an 18% increase in obesity

change group). This compared with a 2% increase among
those who acquired a nonmotorized form of transportation
(50 participants) and an 8% increase among the group who
had no change in vehicle ownership (661 participants). The
equivalent increases in obesity for women (13%, 9%, and
13%, respectively) were not significantly different. We ex-
cluded 28 participants who lost or sold a vehicle. At base-
line, those who acquired a motorized vehicle were younger
(p  0.05, men and women), heavier (p  0.05, men), and
had a lower daily-energy intake (p  0.01, men and
women). Fat intake was not significantly different. They
were less likely to engage in heavy work-related activity
(p  0.05, women) but more likely to have high income
(p  0.01, men), have at least one TV in the household (p 
0.01, men and women), and to live in an urban area com-
pared with those who had no change in vehicle ownership.
These differences were more obvious for men than women.
Motorized vehicle acquisition was an important predictor
of weight gain in men. Compared with those who had no
change in vehicle ownership and excluding all those who
were obese at baseline, men in households who acquired a
motorized vehicle experienced a 1.8 kg (95% CI, 0.82 to
2.83) greater weight gain after adjustment for confounders
(Figure 2). The unadjusted weight gain was 2.2 kg. Baseline
secondary (1.04 kg; 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.78) and tertiary (3.62
kg; 95% CI, 1.94 to 5.31) vs. primary education, decline in
work-related physical activity (1.27 kg; 95% CI, 0.41 to
2.13), energy intake (0.49 kg/1000 kcal; 95% CI, 0.16 to
0.83), and an increase in per capita income (0.24 kg/1000
yuan; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.46) were also significant predictors
of weight gain. Being older at baseline (0.06 kg; 95% CI,
0.12 to 0.01) predicted weight loss. A separate model
partitioning energy intake into fat and nonfat components
did not alter the association between weight gain and vehi-
cle acquisition but did emphasis the importance of increas-
ing dietary fat on weight gain (1.0 kg/1000 kcal from fat;
95% CI, 0.37 to 1.67). Women from households who ac-
quired a motorized vehicle gained 0.4 kg, a gain that re-
mained nonsignificant after adjustment for confounders.
However, higher weight at baseline predicted significant
weight loss (0.05 kg; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.01), whereas
lower intensity activity at work (0.92 kg; 95% CI, 0.15 to
1.68) and higher income (0.32 kg/1000 yuan; 95% CI, 0.14
to 0.49) predicted weight gain. Urban residence (0.70 kg;
95% CI, 0.08 to 1.48) was also an important predictor of
weight gain in women.
Individuals who were underweight at baseline would
benefit from gaining weight, and therefore, an increase in
weight in this population does not pose a threat to public
health unless it represents a shift from normal or overweight
status to obesity. For this reason we investigated the odds of
becoming obese according to household vehicle acquisition.
Compared with no change in vehicle ownership, the acqui-
sition of a motorized vehicle was associated with greater
odds of becoming obese in men (Figure 3). An unadjusted
model (n  988) yielded odds of 2.35 (95% CI, 1.45 to
3.82) to 1 of becoming obese with motorized vehicle ac-
quisition. These odds were attenuated somewhat by adjust-
ment for confounders, but they remained significant (OR,
2.16; 95% CI, 1.09 to 4.27). Men who acquired nonmotor-
ized transportation between 1989 and 1997 were at lower
odds (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.07 to 1.25 unadjusted; OR, 0.46;
95% CI, 0.06 to 3.70 adjusted) of becoming obese than
those who had no change in vehicle ownership, but the
difference was not significant. Interestingly, motorized ve-
hicle acquisition did not increase the odds of becoming
obese for women, regardless of adjustment.
Discussion
In this study, using both cross-sectional and cohort data,
household ownership of motorized transportation was asso-
ciated with obesity in men and women, and the acquisition
of a motorized vehicle increased the odds of becoming
obese in men. Furthermore, these associations persisted
after adjustment for an array of environmental, behavioral,
and biological factors known to influence weight.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to look di-
rectly at the impact of motorized transportation on
weight. Transportation is most commonly mentioned in
the literature as a barrier to effective nutrition-exercise
intervention programs and not as an independent risk
factor for obesity (19,20). Only a handful of studies relate
transportation and obesity. One cross-sectional study of
290 adults in Bahrain found that ownership of a car was
positively associated with obesity (21). In the U.S., long-
haul truck drivers are known to be at risk for sleep apnea
and other obesity-related disorders. (22,23)
Despite this lack of evidence, the relationship we ob-
served between mode of transportation and obesity is an
intuitive one, and one with an obvious etiologic pathway.
The health benefits of walking and other forms of aerobic
exercise for weight control have been well-established in an
Figure 2: Change in weight with the acquisition of nonmotorized
or motorized transportation: 1989 to 1997.

experimental context (24,25). Walking has also been dem-
onstrated to be beneficial to health in free-living contexts
(26,27). Motorization contributes to obesity by replacing
active forms of transportation, such as walking or cycling,
with passive forms. Ecological data also support our obser-
vations. First, the proliferation of motorized transportation
in affluent countries has coincided with the increasing prev-
alence of obesity (16). Second, countries that emphasize active
forms of transportation, such as Holland, have lower levels
of obesity than countries that don't, such as the U.S. (28).
Cities in China tend to have the high population density
and mixed land uses (i.e., people work in walking or cycling
distance from home) that are conducive to nonmotorized
forms of transportation (16). Moreover, as we have shown,
bicycling and walking remain the dominant forms of trans-
portation. A cost of continued economic development, how-
ever, seems to be worsening conditions for cyclists and
pedestrians, as cities make way for motorized forms of
transportation (29). One reason could be that cars have
become a symbol of economic success, and this may partly
explain our observation that motorized vehicle acquisition
led to weight gain in men but not women. We did not have
a measure of vehicle use, but it is likely that men were the
predominant users of motorized vehicles whereas women
were more likely to use nonmotorized vehicles. No devel-
oping country data exist on gender differences in vehicle
use. However, gender differences in the incidence of fatal
automobile crashes in the U.S. can be attributed to greater
exposure among men (30). With evidence that declines in
work-related physical activity are related to weight gain in
China, coupled with increases in dietary-fat intake (9,31),
people will need to adopt more active leisure-time activities
and maximize their opportunities for incidental physical
activity (e.g., walking to work or shops). Increased automo-
bile dependence does not need to be an inevitable
consequence of economic development. China has the op-
portunity to develop their traditional dependence on non-
motorized vehicles into an obesity prevention strategy. This
will require preserving existing policies and infrastructure
that support nonmotorized transportation and avoiding
changes in urban form and transportation systems that en-
courage motorized transportation. Ironically, the U.S. and
other countries are now putting considerable effort into
recreating the type of active transportation environment that
China currently has (32,33).
Our study has some limitations. The data are not nation-
ally representative. We did not have data on waist circum-
ference at the onset of study, and future analyses need to test
the impact of vehicle acquisition on the distribution of body
fat. It is likely that there is a lag time between acquisition of
a motorized vehicle and the onset of obesity. However, so
few people acquired a motorized vehicle between 1989 and
1993 that we were unable to demonstrate this. Also, we did not
adequately address the issue of endogeneity (34). People may
choose their mode of transportation based on reasons related to
their weight. We think this is unlikely in China, especially
compared with the U.S., but to truly address this issue, a
prospective, randomized control trial is needed where weight
change is monitored in people randomly assigned to receive
a motor vehicle or to maintain their no-vehicle status.
Encouraging active forms of transportation may be one
way to protect against the obesity epidemic. There are
numerous economical and environmental advantages to lim-
iting automobile dependence. These data suggest there may
also be advantages in terms of public health.
