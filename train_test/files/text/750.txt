The Economic Consequences of Widowhood on
Elderly Women in the United States and Germany
Thomas L. Hungerford1
Purpose: Different countries have different goals for social
welfare policy. Consequently, it is reasonable to expect differ-
ent outcomes after certain events. This article examines
changes in the economic well-being of elderly women at wid-
owhood in the United States and Germany. Design and
Methods: Longitudinal data from the U.S. Panel Study of In-
come Dynamics and the German Socioeconomic Panel were
used to prepare a sample of elderly widows. Economic well-
being the year before the husband's death was compared with
economic well-being the year after the husband's death.
Results: Although the prevalence of poverty is different in the
two countries, most widows in both countries experienced a
decline in living standards, and many actually fell into poverty
at widowhood. A fall in Social Security and pension income
was the largest contributor to the fall in living standards.
Implications: The retirement income system in both countries
seems to be adequate for married couples but appears to fail
for widows.
Key Words: Widowhood, Social Security, Economic well-being
Poverty rates among unmarried elderly women in
the United States are among the highest of any demo-
graphic group. In 1997, the poverty rate for unmar-
ried elderly women was 19% compared with a pov-
erty rate of less than 5% for married elderly couples
(see Appendix, Note 1). Unmarried women make up
almost 60% of the U.S. elderly poor while accounting
for only a third of the total elderly population (Na-
tional Economic Council, 1998). One reason for the
high poverty rate among elderly women in the United
States is their reliance on Social Security as a sole or
major source of income. Social Security was never
meant to provide adequate income but rather to be a
foundation to be built on with pensions and savings.
On average, unmarried elderly women derive over
half of their income from Social Security, and, for the
poorest 40% of unmarried elderly women, Social Se-
curity accounts for over 75% of their total income
(Social Security Administration, 1998).
Nevertheless, Social Security is probably the most
effective antipoverty program in the United States:
Poverty rates of elderly people have fallen dramati-
cally over the past 60 years since the program began
paying benefits (Smolensky, Danziger, & Gottschalk,
1988). Social Security plays a large role in reducing
both the poverty rate and the poverty gap among el-
derly people and disabled people (Hungerford, 1996).
However, it apparently is not as effective in prevent-
ing poverty among elderly women after the death of
a spouse or divorce (Burkhauser, Duncan, & Hauser,
1994). To reduce poverty among widows (80% of all
unmarried elderly women), some have proposed that
Social Security survivor benefits be increased and
spouse benefits be lowered to shift income from a
time of low poverty risk to a time of high poverty risk
(e.g., Iams & Sandell, 1998; Sandell & Iams, 1996;
Social Security Advisory Council, 1997).
A commonly accepted fact is that widowhood in-
creases the likelihood of being poor. Burkhauser,
Holden, and Feaster (1988), using the Retirement
History Study (RHS; see Appendix, Note 2), found
that for nonpoor older married women who eventu-
ally become widows, widowhood and a fall in non-
wage income are the two events most associated
with a fall into poverty. Myers, Burkhauser, and
Holden (1987) and Hurd and Wise (1989), also using
the RHS, found that poverty rates of women who be-
came widowed jumped dramatically after the deaths
of their husbands. However, both studies also found
a correlation between economic status before and
during widowhood. Bound, Duncan, Laren, and
Oleinick (1991), using the Panel Study of Income Dy-
namics and a much wider distribution of ages, con-
cluded that "economic status prior to widowhood is
the strongest predictor of status during widowhood"
(p. 115). Obviously, the commonly accepted fact is
only part of the story.
In this article, I examine two issues related to the
death of an elderly spouse and economic well-being.
The first issue deals with economic status before and
after the death of a spouse: Are elderly women who
are poor after becoming widows poor before? The
answer to this question has important policy implica-
tions. Will policy proposals to reduce the Social Se-
curity spouse benefit and raise the survivor benefit

just transfer income from one time of poverty to an-
other time of poverty? The second issue is how the
United States compares with a country that has a dif-
ferent philosophy toward social welfare programs.
This study differs from other studies in two important
respects: First, it examines living standards and in-
come before and after the death of an elderly
woman's husband. Second, it compares the United
States with Germany in the 1980s and 1990s.
The results show that in both the United States and
Germany, most elderly women experienced a fall in
living standards at widowhood, and many fell into
poverty. Also in both countries, poor widows were
much more likely than other widows to be poor be-
fore the deaths of their husbands. Last, a fall in Social
Security and pension income was the primary con-
tributor to the fall in income at widowhood. This arti-
cle is organized as follows: The next section briefly
explains the retirement income systems in the two
countries. The third section describes the data used
for the analysis, and the results of the analysis are
presented in the section that follows. Concluding re-
marks are offered in the final section.
Retirement Income Systems in the United States
and Germany
The World Bank (1994) argued that a multipillar
system is necessary for income security in old age
and that different pillars have different functions and
should have different levels of government involve-
ment. In the United States, these pillars are often re-
ferred to as the three legs of the retirement income
stool: Social Security, pension income, and savings.
Germany has a similar multipillar system for retire-
ment income.
The first pillar in both countries is Social Security,
which is part of the social insurance system started in
1935 in the United States and in 1889 in Germany.
There are many similarities in the Social Security sys-
tems of the two countries. Social Security coverage is
mandatory and nearly universal, and both systems
are paid for by workers and their employers, al-
though the German system also receives some gov-
ernment subsidies. At retirement workers receive a
Social Security benefit based on lifetime earnings and
age, but the benefit is progressive in that workers
with lower lifetime earnings receive a proportion-
ately higher benefit than workers with higher lifetime
earnings, although workers with higher lifetime earn-
ings receive higher benefits. The German benefit
tends to be much more generous than the U.S. bene-
fit. Börsch-Supan and Schnabel (1999) reported that
the German benefit replaces about 72% of preretire-
ment net earnings of a worker with average lifetime
earnings, which is substantially higher than the 53%
replacement rate of the U.S. benefit for a worker with
average lifetime earnings.
There are also some significant differences be-
tween the two countries' systems. In the United
States, the retired worker's spouse will receive a ben-
efit based on the retired worker's earnings equal to
up to 50% of the retired worker's benefit. However, if
the spouse has a substantial work history, he or she
will receive the higher of the spouse benefit or a re-
tired worker benefit based on his or her own earnings
and age. The German Social Security system does not
pay a spouse benefit, but women with some attach-
ment to the labor market (at least 15 years of work
with 10 years after age 40) will receive a benefit
based on their earnings and age (see Appendix, Note
3). In the United States, after the death of the retired
worker, the widow(er), if 60 years or older, receives a
survivor's benefit equal to the retired worker's benefit
(see Appendix, Note 4). In Germany, after the death
of the retired worker, the survivor, if 45 years or
older, receives 100% of the deceased worker's bene-
fit for 3 months and then 60% thereafter.
Of the three pillars, Social Security is mandatory,
whereas the other two pillars (pensions and savings)
are voluntary. Consequently, many people rely on
the first pillar as a sole source of income in old age
because they were unable or unwilling to save and
were not covered by a pension plan while working.
Individuals in different parts of the income distribu-
tion rely on different combinations of income sources.
Table 1 shows that those elderly persons in the bot-
tom decile of the income distribution in both coun-
tries rely primarily on Social Security for income sup-
port--about 70% of income comes from Social
Security. At the other end of the distribution, Social
Security is a fairly important source of income, but it is
not the only source. In both countries, earnings and
pension each contribute more toward income support
than Social Security for those in the top decile.
Data and Methods
The data sources for this study are the Panel Study
of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the German Socio-
economic Panel (GSOEP). The PSID is a nationally
representative longitudinal data set of the U.S. popu-
lation that has been ongoing since 1968 (Hill, 1992).
The PSID interviewed a national sample of 4,800
households in 1968, and the number interviewed has
grown to over 7,000 today. The replacement mecha-
nism of the PSID for births is designed to yield a rep-
resentative sample in each year.
The GSOEP is a longitudinal data set started in
1984. The data are representative of the population

of the western states of the reunified Germany, in-
cluding "guest workers," and currently consists of
over 6,000 households (Wagner, Burkhauser, & Beh-
ringer, 1993). The PSID methodology influenced the
development of the GSOEP, and the methods for fol-
lowing households are similar in the two samples.
A 1980­1997 PSID­GSOEP equivalent file is avail-
able (Burkhauser, Butrica, & Daly, 1995). The file
contains equivalently defined variables (to the extent
possible) on income, employment, and demographic
information from the PSID and the GSOEP. Also in-
cluded are annual price indices for the two countries
and median household annual income. The PSID
data contain information on over 7,000 households
for the years 1980­1997. The GSOEP file contains
data on over 5,000 households for the years 1984­
1997.
The income measure used in the study was post-
transfer, pretax income. There were several reasons
for choosing this measure. First, it is the income mea-
sure used in the United States for official poverty sta-
tistics and is used by most researchers in poverty re-
search. Second, tax information is not available in
the PSID file after 1991; thus, almost half of the sam-
ple would be unusable. Third, taxes in each data set
are calculated on the basis of household characteris-
tics rather than actual taxes paid by the household.
Fourth, if taxes were subtracted from income, not
only would income be lower but so too would the
poverty thresholds (see Appendix, Note 5). House-
hold income is adjusted to reflect the composition of
the household (household size and ages of house-
hold members), using the detailed official U.S. equiv-
alence weight (see Appendix, Note 6). People are
ranked on basis of the income of the household they
live in adjusted for household size and composition
(see Appendix, Note 7).
The concept of poverty is different in the two
countries (Germany does not have an official poverty
threshold), consequently a comparable measure of
poverty needed to be developed. I use two different
thresholds in this article, but both are based on me-
dian household income. The first is 35% of median
equivalence-adjusted household income (denoted
POVLIN35); the second is 45% of median equivalence-
adjusted household income (denoted POVLIN45).
Median income is determined for the entire PSID and
GSOEP samples for each year. I chose a relative pov-
erty threshold because an absolute measure (updated
for inflation) would fall further behind living stan-
dards (measured by median income) during eco-
nomic expansions. A relative measure has a fixed re-
lationship to the standard of living, and changes in
the standard of living of elderly widows are the main
focus of this article. In the United States, it should be
noted, the poverty rate, using a relative threshold, is
generally higher than the official poverty rate (Dan-
ziger, Haveman, & Plotnick, 1986). For the United
States, POVLIN35 yielded about the same level of
poverty as the official U.S. measure when averaged
over several years but did not track year-to-year changes.
This is because income and prices grow at different
rates. POVLIN45 yielded a higher poverty rate on av-
erage and in all years. This measure yielded poverty
rates that were 42% (United States) and 75% (Ger-
many) greater than the 35% measure. I used POVLIN45
because many researchers and policymakers (includ-
ing myself) believe that the U.S. official poverty
threshold is too low. Burkhauser and colleagues (1995)
provided a more detailed discussion of the differ-
ences between the United States and Germany re-
garding poverty.
The sample used in this study included all women
58 years of age or older who were initially married
and living with their husbands, who were living in a
family receiving Social Security or pension income,
and who were eventually widowed. Three years of
data were used in the study: Year t is the year of the
husband's death, Year t  1 is the year before wid-
owhood (i.e., the women were married), and Year t 
1 is the year after the husband's death occurred.
Only Years t  1 and t  1 were compared because
the data files did not record when during the inter-
view year (Year t) the death occurred. Furthermore,
income in the year of widowhood (Year t) may not be
comparable to the years before or after because
lump-sum death benefits (e.g., life insurance) are of-
ten paid to widows and may temporarily increase in-
come. The final sample used contained data on 177
women in Germany (see Appendix, Note 8) and 259
women in the United States. Household weights
were used throughout the analysis.
Table 2 reports some descriptive information on
the women in the sample. The age distribution in Pe-
riod t  1 was similar in the two samples: The mean
in both was about 71 years, and the range was from
58 years to the late 80s. All women were 60 years or
older in Year t  1 and were therefore eligible to re-
ceive survivor benefits in both countries. Over 50%
of the women in the German sample and 39% in the
U.S. sample had less than a high school education.
Another major difference between the two samples
was that 22% of the women in the U.S. sample had
education past high school, and only 1% of women
in the German sample had education past high
school. Part of this could be due to institutional dif-
ferences in educational systems in the two countries

(see Appendix, Note 9). Average household sizes in
Period t  1 and in Period t  1 in the two countries
were roughly the same.
The method used in this article was a tabular anal-
ysis of poverty and income dynamics. The poverty
measures examined were the poverty rate and the av-
erage poverty gap. The poverty gap is the difference
between the poverty threshold and household in-
come if the difference is positive and is equal to zero
otherwise. The income measures were income
changes and mobility within the income distribution.
When examining income mobility, mobility refers to
movement within the distribution of the entire sam-
ple of households, not just the sample of elderly wid-
ows. Hypothesis tests were conducted for either Pe-
riod t  1 to t  1 changes in each measure or for
U.S.­German differences in these measures.
Poverty Dynamics
Poverty dynamics in the two countries were sensi-
tive to the poverty threshold used. Results for both
the 35% (POVLIN35) and 45% (POVLIN45) thresh-
olds are presented and discussed. Table 3 shows the
poverty rate and poverty gap for Periods t  1 and t 
1 in both countries. The hypothesis tested was
whether the Period t  1 and the Period t  1 mea-
sures were equal. The first half of the table presents
the results using POVLIN35, and the second half pre-
sents the results using POVLIN45.
The period t  1 poverty rate for these women in
the United States was 12% and increased by 10 per-
centage points (almost doubling) to 22% in the year
after widowhood. This increase in poverty is statisti-
cally significant at the 1% level. The average poverty
gap tripled from $221 to $679 in the United States
between Period t  1 and Period t  1. When exam-
ining just widows who were poor in Period t  1,
two points are worth emphasizing. First, the Period t 
1 average poverty gap of t  1 poor widows was
much larger than the average poverty gap of the
whole sample (200% larger in the United States)--
Period t  1 poor widows started out in Period t  1
(when married) much poorer than most widows. Sec-
ond, the increase in the average poverty gap between
Periods t  1 and t  1 was particularly startling--
350% in the United States (this increase was statisti-
cally significant at the 1% level). In contrast, the pov-
erty rate in Germany started out in Period t  1 at just
3% and increased by 5.7 percentage points, or tri-
pled, in Period t  1. The increase in poverty gap in
Germany at widowhood, however, was just as star-
tling as the increase in the United States.
The second half of Table 3 presents the poverty re-
sults using POVLIN45 as the threshold. The overall
Period t  1 to Period t  1 dynamics in both coun-
tries were pretty much the same, although the starting
poverty rates and poverty gaps were much higher in
both countries. The results in the halves of Table 3
suggest that in both the United States and Germany
poor widows started out from a more disadvantaged
position than nonpoor widows and become much
poorer after the deaths of their husbands, although
there was a smaller proportion of poor widows in
Germany.
The next table, Table 4, shows the distribution of
income in relation to the poverty threshold. The col-
umns in this table show the Period t  1 and t  1
distributions for the entire sample in both countries,
plus the distribution in Period t  1 of those widows
who were poor in Period t  1 (labeled t  1 poor in
t  1). The first half of the table shows the results
when using POVLIN35 as the poverty threshold. The
Period t  1 columns (a) reiterate the poverty rate
results shown in Table 3 and (b) show that most
women who became widows were not concentrated
just above the poverty threshold. Consequently, it was
not just small changes in income that pushed many of
these widows into poverty. Over half of these widows
in the United States lived in households with income
over double the poverty threshold. In addition, 17%
of Period t  1 poor widows started out in Period t 
1 in households with income over twice the poverty
threshold. The column for Period t  1 shows that the
distribution generally shifted down toward the pov-
erty threshold, but still nearly half of the widows had
income that was at least twice the poverty threshold.
The overall pattern in Germany was not that much
different than that in the United States.
As would be expected, with the POVLIN45 thresh-
old poverty appeared to be much more persistent--a
higher proportion of Period t  1 poor widows were
poor or near poor in Period t  1 (see bottom half of
Table 4). In Period t  1, more U.S. women were
concentrated near the poverty threshold, and more
women were below the poverty threshold. Fewer

than half of the women had income above 200% of
the poverty threshold. The results were even more
striking for the Period t  1 poor widows: over 40%
were poor in Period t  1, and another 20% were
near poor (i.e., 100% to 125% of the poverty thresh-
old) in the United States. In Germany, many of the
same qualitative results are evident. In addition, 28%
of Period t  1 poor widows were poor in Period t 
1, 24% were near poor, and an additional 27% were
at 125%­150% of the poverty threshold.
Poverty transitions between Period t  1 and Pe-
riod t  1 are shown in Table 5. When POVLIN35
was used (top half), three quarters of the women in
the U.S. sample were not poor in both Periods t  1
and t  1 compared with 90% of the women in the
German sample (the U.S.­German difference was
statistically significant at the 1% level). Slightly less
than 10% in the United States and less than 3% in
Germany were poor in both periods (again, the U.S.­
German difference was statistically significant at the
1% level). Even though a very small minority in each
country were always poor, it turns out that in the
United States 40% of Period t  1 poor widows were
poor before widowhood in contrast to 29% of Period
t  1 poor German widows. The results were qualita-
tively similar when POVLIN45 was used (bottom half
of Table 5).
Income Dynamics
The results on poverty dynamics in the previous
section show the proportion of elderly widows who
moved above or below a particular threshold. How-
ever, these results do not provide much information
on how living standards changed more generally. Ta-
ble 6 shows how income changed for these women
between Periods t  1 and t  1. The top two rows
show the median equivalent real household income
(in 1991 currency units) for these women in Periods
t  1 and t  1. Median real income decreased
slightly in both countries. On the basis of these me-
dian values, one might conclude that widowhood
brings a small change in living standards. The results

108 The Gerontologist
from the previous section show that this conclusion is
certainly not valid for some widows (i.e., poor wid-
ows); however, is this conclusion valid for most wid-
ows? The next rows in Table 6 show that the median
fall in equivalent real income after the husband's
death was 16%, and about two thirds of the widows
experienced a fall in equivalent real income in the
United States. Almost 60% experienced a 10% or
greater fall in income, and almost 25% of these
women experienced a 10% or more increase in
equivalent real income after the deaths of their hus-
bands. Although a similar proportion of German wid-
ows experienced a fall in income after widowhood,
the fall was not nearly as large as that of U.S. widows
(the median decrease was 9%).
Although Table 6 shows how income changed, it
does not show which income changed. Elderly cou-
ples and widows receive income from several sources,
all of which can change over time or after certain
events such as widowhood. For Table 7, each sample
(U.S. and German) was split into three groups, based
on the percentage of change in equivalent real
household income (labeled %Inc in the table) be-
tween Periods t  1 and t  1. Average income from
each source for each group was then calculated for
Period t  1 and Period t  1.
For the U.S. widows who experienced a large de-
cline in income (at least a 10% fall; see Appendix,
Note 10), the largest absolute change in income was
retirement income (Social Security plus other in-
come; see Appendix, Notes 11 and 12), accounting
for about 44% of the total decrease in income. After
retirement income (Social Security and pension in-
come), a fall in labor income was the second largest
absolute change. Most of the Period t  1 labor in-
come for these women was earned by the hus-
bands--about 20% (most in part-time jobs) of the
U.S. sample worked in Period t  1 (see Appendix,
Note 13). The loss of the main breadwinner and a fall
in Social Security and pension income accounted for
the lower living standards of many widows. To-
gether, the change in labor income, Social Security
income, and other income accounted for 73% of the
fall in income in the United States. In Germany, the
fall in retirement income (i.e., Social Security) and la-
bor income accounted for 94% of the fall in total in-
come. Either the retirement income system (Social
Security and pensions) is failing a substantial number
of widows in each country, or many families are not
adequately preparing for retirement in both coun-
tries.
The next group of widows was women experienc-
ing either a small decrease or a small increase (10%)
in income. Generally, in both countries the change in
each component of total income was fairly small,
and only one of the t  1/t  1 differences (Social Se-
curity income in Germany) approached statistical sig-
nificance (at the 10% level). The final group is the
women who experienced a large (i.e., more than
10%) increase in real equivalent household income
at widowhood. Again, there were few differences be-
tween the two countries. The single largest increase
in income was in asset income (see Appendix, Note
14). There are two possible reasons for the large in-
crease in this component of total household income.
The first source could be the annuitization of a large
life insurance distribution. The second source could
be an increase in the imputed rental value (equiva-
lent) of owner-occupied housing, as ownership of
this asset is generally transferred to the widow (see
Appendix, Note 15).
Next, I examine how widowhood affects a woman's
position in the income distribution. Table 8 shows
the distribution of movement within the income dis-

tribution (quintile movement) between Periods t  1
and t  1 (see Appendix, Note 16). In both countries,
about 50% of widows lived in households in the
poorest two income quintiles before they became
widows (see Appendix, Tables 1A and 2A). Further-
more, of the widows who started in the poorest two
quintiles in Period t  1, the vast majority (86% in
the United States and 73% in Germany) remained in
the poorest two quintiles in Period t  1. Many wid-
ows were in the poorest 40% of the population be-
fore their husbands' deaths, and most remained there
afterward. Very few women actually moved up in the
income distribution (15% in the United States and
27% in Germany). The proportions for quintile mo-
bility in Table 8 were based on the number of
women who could potentially move the number of
quintiles indicated. For example, the proportion who
moved up two or more quintiles were those women
who started out in the bottom three quintiles of the
income distribution. In both countries, almost 45% of
the widows did not change their quintile position in
the income distribution. Roughly the same propor-
tion of widows moved down one quintile in both the
United States and Germany (35% and 30%, respec-
tively). A larger proportion moved down two or more
quintiles in the United States than in Germany, and
the difference was statistically significant at the 1%
level. Interestingly, 25% of the women who could
move two or more quintiles did move two or more
quintiles in Germany, compared with only 5% in the
United States.
Concluding Remarks
Widowhood, in both the United States and Ger-
many, is a time of loss. Widows have lost not only
their husbands but also, for many, their standard of liv-
ing. Many American and German women become
poor at widowhood, and many American women
are poor before widowhood and then become even
poorer after the loss of their husbands. In Germany,
women are two to three times more likely to be in
poverty after the deaths of their husbands than when
they were married. In the United States, women who
become widows are less than twice as likely to fall
into poverty after the deaths of their husbands. In addi-
tion, many poor widows were poor before the deaths
of their husbands. It must be emphasized, however,
that the poverty rate for elderly widows in the United
States was more than double the rate in Germany.
Most widows in the United States and Germany
experienced a fall in real income after the deaths of
their husbands. A fall in Social Security and pension
income was the largest contributor to the fall in total
income in both countries, and the loss of the hus-
band's labor income was the second largest contribu-
tor. But not all widows were worse off financially af-
ter the deaths of their husbands; one in four widows
actually experienced a large rise in income (i.e., by
over 10%), mostly due to an increase in asset income.
The German retirement income system appears
much more effective than the U.S. system in keeping
retired married couples out of poverty because Social
Security benefits are more generous (taxes are also
higher, though). However, both the U.S. and German
systems are much less successful in maintaining the
living standards of women who become widows.
These results suggest that proposals in the United
States to reduce the spouse benefit and increase the
survivor benefit would, for many, just transfer in-
come from a time of poverty to another time of pov-
erty (see Appendix, Note 17). A policy to increase
survivor benefits only or to increase means-tested
benefits could be effective in maintaining the living
standards of elderly widows, but program costs would
necessarily increase.

Appendix
Notes
1. This 19% poverty rate is just slightly lower than the 20%
poverty rate for children under 18 years.
2. The RHS sample consists of women married to men born
between 1905 and 1911.
3. Börsch-Supan and Schnabel (1999) noted that most wives
receive their own benefits.
4. This assumes the widow(er) is not eligible for a higher Social
Security benefit on the basis of his or her earnings record.
5. The poverty threshold is based on median income.
Incorporating taxes would change the income distribution
since taxes are progressive. The calculated poverty threshold
would be lower; consequently, the poverty rates in both
countries would also be lower. Taxes are more progressive in
Germany than in the United States. However, based on a
limited analysis with the reduced data set the qualitative
results hold if taxes are incorporated, but in many instances
cell sizes are very small.
6. This equivalence weight is based on the official poverty
threshold in the United States and accounts for economies of
scale by adjusting for both the size and the composition of
the family.
7. An implicit assumption is that income is freely shared among
household members.
8. No German guest workers were included in the sample
because they are not eligible to receive Social Security
benefits.
9. Burkhauser and colleagues (1995) reported that the
education variables are not entirely comparable between the
two countries.
10. This group accounted for almost 60% of the widows in the
United States and almost 50% of the widows in Germany
(see Table 6).
11. From the income variable calculation appendix in the
codebook (Butrica & Jurkat, n.d.), Social Security income in
Germany included income from Social Security pensions plus
income from employer or occupational old-age pensions. In
the U.S. sample, Social Security income included only
income from the Social Security Administration.
12. Other income in the United States included employer
pension income as well as transfers from persons outside of the
household. In the German sample, other income included
only transfers from persons outside of the household.
13. Of the households where women worked in Period t  1,
their labor income accounted for 43% of total household
labor income in the United States.
14. Asset income included income from assets plus the imputed
rental value of owner-occupied housing. The imputed rental
value of owner-occupied housing captures a cost that
homeowners do not incur and was considered as income.
15. The imputed rental of owner-occupied housing most likely
remains constant over Periods t  1 to t  1, but the
equivalence factor becomes smaller after the husband's
death. Consequently, the equivalent value of this income
source will increase after the husband's death.
16. The transition matrices for both the United States and
Germany are shown in Appendix Tables 1A and 2A. Income
quintiles are defined for all households and are based on
equivalent household income. Consequently, the rows and
columns in Appendix Tables 1A and 2A do not necessarily
have to sum to 20%.
17. It can also be argued that for families with high discount rates
a transfer of income (inflation adjusted) to the future would
make the family worse off.
