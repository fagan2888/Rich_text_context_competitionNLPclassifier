THE 2004 United States Health Report determined that
80% of the geriatric population (adults aged 65 years
and older) surveyed in 1999­2000 took at least one pre-
scription drug in the prior month (National Center for Health
Statistics, 2004).About half of the individuals in the same age
group reported taking three or more prescription drugs, repre-
senting an increase of nearly 50% over the prior 5­10 years.
Considering that older adults in the United States consume a
disproportionately large and increasing share of medications,
there is a growing need to understand and account for the
physiological role of medications, physical, and mental (psy-
chological, cognitive) side effects of medications, and medica-
tion use behavior in analyses pertinent to older adult health.
Accurate assessment of medication use in studies of older
adult health is essential and requires methods for collection
and coding of medication data, incorporation of medi-
cation data into health-related analyses, and interpretation
of medication-related findings. Incorporation of medication
data into biosocial models of older adult health is important
for informing health care practices, improving medication-
related health outcomes, and understanding biological path-
ways through which social factors and conditions affect
health in later life. Incorporation of biological measures as
predictors of health or social outcomes in gerontological re-
search requires consideration of the effects of medications
on both the biomeasures and outcomes of interest.
Methods for the collection and coding of medication data
in population-based survey research differ across studies
and are described with variable detail in the social and epi-
demiological research literature (Pahor et al., 1994). Most
studies derive medication data from chart review, adminis-
trative/claims data, or self-report of prescribed medicines
(thus, nonprescription medications are not included). For
medication use data, an in-home inventory of medications
obtained by direct observation has been shown to be a more
reliable measurement tool than self-report recall methods
(Landry et al., 1988; Psaty et al., 1992). Coding of medica-
tion data depends on the study objective and also varies
across studies. Because a variety of proprietary databases
can be purchased and used to code medication data, includ-
ing First Databank® and Multum®, classification of medi-
cation data may not be consistent across studies.
This paper describes the collection, coding, and validity
of the medication use data from the National Social Life,
Health and Aging Project (NSHAP)--a survey of a national
probability sample of 3,005 community-residing older
adults aged 57­85 years. The most comparable prior studies
are the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the
Slone Survey, and the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES). Important differences be-
tween the data collection protocols used in these studies and
those used in NSHAP include: (a) MEPS collects information

Objectives To describe the collection, coding, and validity of medication data from the National Social Life, Health
and Aging Project (NSHAP)--a survey of a national probability sample of adults aged 57­85 years.
Methods Medication data were collected during an in-home interview by direct observation using a computer-based
log and included prescription, over-the-counter, and nutritional supplements. The Multum® drug database was used for
coding drug names and for mapping those names to therapeutic categories. Drugs not included in Multum® were as-
signed to medication classes by extending Multum's typology. Internal and external validity of the medication data are
examined and analytic use of the medication data is discussed.
Results Only 0.9% of respondents refused to participate in the medication log. Ninety-nine percent of all entries were
identified and mapped to a medication class. Use of medication classes correlated highly with the presence of correspond-
ing health conditions and related biological measures. The prevalence of use of common therapeutic classes of medica-
tions in NSHAP is comparable to that found in other national studies.
Discussion Nearly all NSHAP respondents cooperated with the medication use data collection protocol. Medication
data obtained by the in-home, direct observation medication log method were found to be internally and externally valid.

on prescription acquisition over a 12-month period (Moeller
et al., 2001), which may overestimate the prevalence of cur-
rent medication use because people may purchase or ac-
quire more medications than they actually use; (b) the Slone
Survey has a substantially smaller sample size of older
adults and uses telephone-based self-report (Kaufman,
Kelly, Rosenberg, Anderson, & Mitchell, 2002; Slone Sur-
vey, 2005); and (c) NHANES measures any use, as opposed
to regular use, of prescription medications in the past month
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2008b).
Another important data set, the Medicare Current Benefi-
ciaries Survey, collects information on prescribed medica-
tions and publishes only aggregate information on the
number of filled prescriptions (Gaskin, Briesacher, Lim-
cango, & Bringantti, 2006). For these reasons, estimates of
medication use based on NSHAP may vary from those ob-
tained in previous studies.
Methods
Collection
Medication data were collected during an in-home inter-
view by direct observation using a computer-based medica-
tion log or inventory. NSHAP field staff specifically asked
"to record all medications that you [respondent] take on a
regular schedule, like every day or every week. This will
include prescription and nonprescription medications, over-
the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal and alternative
medicines." The interviewer, who had no specialized knowl-
edge of medications, directly recorded names of medica-
tions from the medication packaging (e.g., bottle, tube,
blister pack) into the computer. Interviewers were allowed
to record up to 20 medications. It is possible that, in some
cases, the interviewer recorded a medication based only on
the respondent's report (e.g., if the bottle or package was
unavailable), though the fact that this did not arise as a ma-
jor issue during interviewer debriefing suggests that it was
rare (information to indicate that medication data were
logged based on respondent's report rather than direct ob-
servation was not recorded in our computer-based survey
instrument).
Coding of Medications
Initial identification of medication names was accom-
plished using the National Drug Code (NDC) directory, Mi-
cromedex®, and the National Library of Medicine Medline
Plus® Drug and Supplements database. Reported medica-
tion names were translated to generic drug names when pos-
sible and then coded according to the set of drug names in
the Multum drug classification database. We selected Mul-
tum from several available drug databases because it is also
used by NHANES, MEPS, and Health and Retirement Study
to code their medication data. The Multum database is ac-
cessible online (http://www.multum.com) with authoriza-
tion from Multum; the Multum Lexicon Plus version was
used here. Of the 5,801 unique verbatim responses, 5,229
(90%) were matched to a Multum drug name (Figure 1). All
entries were first coded by a clinical pharmacist (D.M.Q.)
and then double-checked by both D.M.Q. and a research as-
sistant working under D.M.Q.'s supervision (A.M.). To pre-
serve confidentiality, medications indicated for the treatment
of HIV/AIDS are excluded from the public-use data set.
In all, 416 (7%) unique responses were identified as drugs
that were not included in the Multum Lexicon Plus data-
base. These names were added to our local copy of the da-
tabase and classified by D.M.Q. according to the existing
Multum therapeutic categories (described subsequently);
we refer to them here as "extended Multum drug names."
Because Multum's coverage of alternative medicines and
nutritional products is not complete, most extended Multum
drug names are included in these categories. Some responses
had insufficient detail to accurately identify exact drug

name but had enough information to adequately match to a
Multum therapeutic category; these were also assigned an
extended Multum drug name--for example, "unspecified
potassium."
For extended Multum drug names, the components were
identified using multiple resources, including the National
Library of Medicine Medline Plus Drugs and Supplements
database, the Natural Standard® database, and Web sites for
product names and labels. Despite the inconsistent and non-
standard terminology used to classify dietary supplements,
we grouped these products as either alternative medicines
or nutritional products. This approach was chosen for con-
sistency with Multum classifications, NHANES, the United
States Slone Survey on Medication Use, and the National
Health and Interview Survey. Alternative medicines in-
cluded two subcategories: (a) herbals/botanicals (e.g., al-
falfa) and (b) nutraceuticals. Nutraceuticals are nonherbal,
nonvitamin, and nonmineral supplements (e.g., glu-
cosamine). Nutritional products included: (a) vitamin and/
or mineral combinations, (b) single vitamins, (c) minerals/
electrolytes, and (d) iron products. Weight loss supplements,
fiber products, and uncategorized products were coded as
"other supplements."
Of the remaining 156 unique entries (2.7%) that could
not be coded according to Multum, 71 clearly indicated a
therapeutic objective and were coded according to this; for
example, the response "medication for diabetes" is coded
as "diabetic medication." Only 85 unique responses were
unrecognizable.
Many analysts will want to work with the medication
data in terms of therapeutic categories; for example, they
may wish to identify all respondents who are currently tak-
ing a particular type of cardiovascular agent. Multum's
therapeutic categories are based on the American Hospital
Formulary Service therapeutic categories and are organized
into a three-level hierarchy permitting classification at the
therapeutic level, pharmacological level, and drug category
level. This is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the way in
which the therapeutic (Level 1) classification "cardiovascu-
lar agents" is subdivided into the pharmacological (Level 2)
categories "antihypertensive combinations," "diuretics,"
and "angiostatin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors." All
diuretics are then further subdivided into specific drug
(Level 3) categories, such as "thiazide diuretics."
The Multum database maps each Multum drug name to a
specific category in the hierarchy, and our extended Multum
names have also been mapped to specific categories as de-
scribed earlier. To facilitate the use of the data set, variables
have been created for each category to indicate whether the
respondent reported taking an item in that category or in one
of the categories below it in the hierarchy. For example, a
respondent taking lisinopril (mapped by Multum to the cat-
egory "angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors") is
coded as taking both ACE inhibitors and cardiovascular
agents, whereas a respondent taking hydrochlorothiazide
(mapped by Multum to the category "thiazide diuretics") is
coded as taking thiazide diuretics, diuretics, and cardiovas-
cular agents.
As with individual drugs, Multum also maps combina-
tion drugs to a specific category. In these cases, the NSHAP
database records not only the location of the combination
but also includes the location of each component. Thus, a
respondent taking hydrocholoriazide­lisinopril would not
only be coded as taking both antihypertensive combinations
and cardiovascular agents but would also be coded under
the categories for single-agent hydrochlorothiazide and sin-
gle-agent lisinopril (as described earlier).
Because the Multum database links individual drug
names to one or more NDCs, and because each NDC code
is classified as either prescription or nonprescription, we
were able to identify those medications in the NSHAP data
set that are available by prescription only (hereafter referred
to as "prescription medications"). Drugs that are not linked
to an NDC code by Multum or for which this linkage is in-
complete were individually reviewed by D.M.Q. and classi-
fied accordingly.
Assessing Validity of Medication Use Data
Internal validity.--Internal validity of the directly ob-
served medication log as an instrument for collecting medi-
cation use data was assessed using three strategies: (a)
extent of agreement between current use of a disease-
specific class of medications (e.g., antidiabetic agents) and
self-report of ever being diagnosed with the disease (e.g.,
diabetes), (b) concordance between gender and use of gen-
der-specific medications (e.g., estrogens and erectile dys-
function agents), and (c) differences in two biological
correlates of medication use--resting pulse (measured
twice and then averaged) as a correlate of beta-adrenergic­
antagonist or ­agonist use and glycosylated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) as a correlate of glucose-lowering drugs--between
users and nonusers. The use of beta-blockers (drugs that
block receptors in the heart and vasculature, with a conse-
quent decrease in heart rate) is expected to cause a decrease
in pulse rate, whereas the use of beta-agonists (drugs that

consequent increase in heart rate) is expected to cause an
increase. HbA1c levels (a measure of glucose metabolism
over the previous 60­90 days) are expected to be higher in
diabetes medication users.
External validity.--To evaluate the external validity of
the medication data, comparisons using available data
from other national studies were performed. To increase
comparability, only those NSHAP respondents aged 65
years and older were included. Stagnitti (2004) and Daniel
and Malone (2007) report on outpatient prescription drugs
purchased by adults older than 65 years in the MEPS. The
Slone Survey (2005) reports on medication use in children
and adults in the United States, but only data for those
aged 65 years and older are used for this comparison. An
analysis of NHANES' prescribed medicines data was con-
ducted for respondents older than 65 years (CDC, 2008a).
Example of Analytic Application
To illustrate one of the ways in which the medication data
may be used in a substantive analysis and the impact it
can have on the results, we fit linear regression models
(Weisberg, 1985) to both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
diastolic blood pressure (DBP), each measured twice and
then averaged. Measurements were taken from the left arm
using a Lifesource digital blood pressure monitor (Model
UA-767PVL). Covariates included age, gender, race/ethnic-
ity, and education (as a proxy for socioeconomic status)--
each of which is known to be related to blood pressure.
Because the use of antihypertensives not only affects blood
pressure but may also mediate and/or moderate the relation-
ship between blood pressure and the covariates, we fit sepa-
rate models among antihypertensive users and nonusers.
Antihypertensive users were identified as those using one or
more medications from the following Multum therapeutic
categories: angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibi-
tors, beta-adrenergic blockers, diuretics, and calcium chan-
nel blockers. Drugs in each of these categories have a known
lowering effect on blood pressure.
Statistical Considerations
All population estimates (proportions, means, and re-
gression coefficients) are weighted using the weights dis-
tributed with the data set, which adjust for differential
probabilities of selection and differential nonresponse.
Standard errors were computed using the linearization
method (Binder, 1983), taking into account the stratifica-
tion and clustering of the sample design. Approximate 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) for all estimates were obtained
by inverting the corresponding Wald test. Hypothesis tests
in Table 4 (represented by starring the corresponding coef-
ficients) were two sided.
Results
Collection
Only 0.9% of respondents refused to participate in the
medication log protocol. Among those who did participate,
8.8% reported taking no medications regularly. Only 0.7%
reported taking 20 or more medications. The mean number
of medications reported was 5.2.
Coding
The 2,717 respondents reporting at least one medication
generated a total of 15,389 log entries. Of these, 14,522
(94.4%) were matched to a Multum drug name and 702
(4.6%) were matched to an extended Multum drug name.
This left only 165 (1.1%) unmatched; of these, 78 were
coded according to therapeutic objective and 87 were un-
recognizable.
Internal Validity
Table 1 shows the proportion of respondents who re-
ported having been diagnosed with diabetes, thyroid prob-
lems, hypertension, or an enlarged prostate, estimated
separately for those regularly taking a corresponding medi-
cation and those who were not. Ninety-five percent of those
taking an antidiabetic agent reported having diabetes, as
compared with only 5% of those not taking one. In contrast,
among those men taking alpha blockers or 5-alpha reductase
inhibitors, only 65% reported having an enlarged prostate,
whereas 22% of men not taking these medications reported
the condition. All the 158 respondents who reported taking
estrogen were women, and all the 29 respondents who re-
ported taking erectile dysfunction agents were men.
The average pulse among those taking beta-blockers was
8.1 beats/min (95% CI = 7.0­9.3) lower than among those

not taking these medications (Table 2). In contrast, the aver-
age pulse was 4.4 beats/min (95% CI = 1.8­6.9) higher
among those taking beta-agonists than among those not tak-
ing them. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels were 1.4 units (%
of total hemoglobin; 95% CI = 1.2­1.6) higher among those
taking antidiabetic agents than among those not taking them.
External Validity
Table 3 compares NSHAP with MEPS, Slone Survey,
and NHANES with respect to the prevalence of medication
use overall, the use of medications from several specific
therapeutic categories, and the use of several specific medi-
cations. In general, the estimates for NSHAP were fairly
similar to those from the other studies, with the observed
differences being in the expected directions. Specifically,
the estimated prevalence of medication use (both any medi-
cation and prescription medications) was slightly higher for
NSHAP than for Slone (which relied on self-report over the
phone), whereas the prevalence and mean number of pre-
scription medications were somewhat lower for NSHAP
than for MEPS (which recorded all drugs purchased, rather
than actually used, during the past year).
Analytic Application
Table 4 shows the results of regressing SBP and DBP
on gender, age, race/ethnicity, and education separately
for those taking antihypertensive medications and those not
taking them. The effects of the covariates on SBP are sub-
stantially greater among those not taking antihypertensives;
in fact, among antihypertensive users, the effects of gender,
race/ethnicity, and education are not even statistically sig-
nificant at the .05 level. Among nonusers, SBP is on average
lower among women, Hispanics, and those with higher edu-
cation, whereas it is higher among Blacks. The same is true
for DBP with regard to race/ethnicity and education; how-
ever, the results for gender and age are slightly different. In
particular, the effects of gender and age are greater among
antihypertensive users, and they are reversed; DBP is
greater among women users and decreases with age.
Discussion
Nearly all NSHAP respondents cooperated with the med-
ication log protocol. The resulting data were then success-
fully coded using the proprietary Multum database, thus
facilitating comparisons with studies such as NHANES and
MEPS (both of which also used Multum to code their data).
Nearly all the recorded entries were able to be matched ei-
ther to a Multum drug name or to an extended Multum drug
name and have, therefore, been classified according to Mul-
tum's therapeutic categories. Because this process involved
identifying a wide range of prescription and nonprescrip-
tion drugs using both generic and brand names, and because
it also involved extending the Multum database to accom-
modate additional alternative medicines and nutritional
products, it required the expertise of both pharmaceutical
and medical experts (D.M.Q. and S.T.L.). The resulting data
set, however, could be used by analysts without such exper-
tise as long as they know which therapeutic categories are
appropriate for their analyses (as discussed subsequently).
As has been found previously (Landry et al., 1988; Psaty
et al., 1992), the medication use data collected using this
procedure were found to correspond well with gender (for
gender-specific medications), with the presence of specific
health conditions and with differences in biological mea-
sures affected by medication use. Although the agreement
between reporting a specific condition and the observed use
of medication indicated for that condition was not perfect,
this is to be expected for several reasons: (a) A specific drug
class may have more than one therapeutic application (e.g.,
antihypertensives may be used for purposes other than treat-
ing blood pressure, such as congestive heart failure or mi-
graine prophylaxis), (b) an individual may have been
diagnosed with a condition that did not currently require
treatment with medication, (c) an individual may have been
diagnosed with a health condition and prescribed medical
treatment but was either unable or unwilling to comply with
the treatment (untreated disease), or (d) an individual was
taking a medication for a condition that was not reported to
the interviewer.
With respect to external validity, the NSHAP data yield
estimates of medication use among community-residing
older adults, which are similar to those from the best prior
medication use data for this population (CDC, 2008b;
Gaskin et al., 2006; Kaufman et al., 2002; Moeller et al.,
2001). Subtle differences between these data sets are likely
due to variations in data collection protocols, differences in
the period of time for which current medication use is de-
fined (e.g., "daily or weekly," "in the week prior to the in-
terview," or "in the past month"), and the fact that some
studies do not collect data on nonprescription medications.
For example, the prevalence of central nervous system agent

use (a class of agents that includes analgesic drugs) was
52% in NSHAP versus 46% in MEPS. Although one might
have expected a higher prevalence estimate from MEPS due
to its longer (12 month) time window, the fact that it fo-
cused solely on prescription medications meant that it did
not include the widely used nonprescribed analgesic medi-
cations (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen). For additional
details on the prevalence and patterns of medication use es-
timated from the NSHAP data set, see Qato and colleagues
(2008).
The NSHAP medication use data are suitable both for
studies in which medication use is the primary outcome and
for those in which the use of one or more specific medica-
tions (or medication classes) is a covariate. The simple ex-
ample shown here--stratifying an analysis of blood pressure
by the use of antihypertensives--demonstrates the impor-
tance of controlling for medication use in the analysis of
health outcomes. In particular, high blood pressure among
those not currently taking antihypertensives reflects either
disease that is undiagnosed, disease that is diagnosed but for
which no treatment has been prescribed, or an inability or
unwillingness to use the prescribed medication. In contrast,
high blood pressure among those taking antihypertensives
may reflect an inadequate treatment or a lack of adherence
to the prescribed treatment. As illustrated in our example,
the social factors affecting these two processes may be dif-
ferent. Although information on medication dosage, com-
pliance, and cost would permit addressing these issues in
greater detail, NSHAP's omnibus nature prevented collect-
ing this additional level of detail. Linkage of the NSHAP
data set to Medicare prescription drug data or drug cost data
sets may be feasible in the future but will require additional
permission from NSHAP participants.
The public-use data set is designed to facilitate a wide range
of analyses by including a series of indicator (0/1) variables,
each of which indicates that a respondent reported taking at

least one medication in a given Multum drug category. These
variables can then be easily combined, as necessary. Doing
this requires knowledge of the Multum classification hierar-
chy (a complete description of which is distributed with the
NSHAP data set) and requires medical and/or pharmaceutical
knowledge. For example, when controlling for the use of anti-
hypertensives, one cannot rely solely on the therapeutic clas-
sification "cardiovascular agents" because subclasses such as
"antianginal agents," "antiarrhythmic agents," and "inotropic
agents" are not specific for the treatment of hypertension; in-
stead, one must combine the various subclasses specific for
hypertension as we did here. It is also important to note that
Multum's therapeutic classes identify the overall therapeutic
effect of the drug and not necessarily the effect of all active
ingredients. Information on therapeutic or pharmacological
categories of specific drugs may be obtained online using the
Drugdex database in Micromedex and the National Library of
Medicine.
