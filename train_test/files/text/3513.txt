Introduction
The ultimate goal of educational systems is to instill in their
learners the basic skills to achieve success, to culture the
learners' mind, to develop active, critical, cognitive skills,
and to make the learners who strive for excellence for them-
selves and others. In fact, in these systems, the sole purpose
of a teacher, as Kreis (2004) asserted, is not to impart knowl-
edge to his or her students, but to shape their beliefs so that
they are regarded as the extension of themselves. However,
how can a teacher shape and reshape the learners' mentality?
Students attend the class with a wide range of knowledge,
socio-cultural background, educational experiences, and per-
sonal attitudes toward English language learning. This signi-
fies the importance of studying learners' belief about
language learning and the ways to enrich it.
Since the 1970s, when cognitive approach to language
learning became prevalent, learners were seen more actively
involved in the process of language learning.Aline of research
dealt with good language learners pioneered by Rubin (1975)
and Naiman, Frohlich, Stern, and Todesco (1996/1978). They
identified a set of strategies that facilitate their learning. The
results of these studies and many others were underlining the
learners' personal beliefs they held as their experience in the
process of language learning. Omaggio (1978) summarized
these studies indicating that good language learners have
"insight into the nature of the task [of learning]" (p. 2).
Hosenfeld (1978) also referred to "mini-theories" of second
language learning that forms the way learners learn language.
These theories are the beliefs learners hold and can be regarded
as a variable, because they can vary from learner to learner.
Much of the research since then has been concerned with pro-
viding new classification for the learners' beliefs.
Administering Beliefs About Language Learning
Inventory (BALLI), Horwitz (1987) suggested five general
areas of beliefs: (a) the difficulty of language learning, (b)
aptitude for language learning, (c) the nature of language
learning, (d) learning and communication strategies, and (e)
motivation and expectations. Wenden (1986, 1987) also
identified a classification of beliefs with three categories: (a)
use of language, (b) beliefs relating to learning about the lan-
guage, and (c) the importance of personal factors.

Learning Strategy Training and the Shift
in Learners' Beliefs About Language
Learning: A Reading Comprehension
Context
Mojtaba Mohammadi1, Parviz Birjandi1, and Parviz Maftoon1
Abstract
This study examines the impact of teaching learning strategies on learners' beliefs about language learning and reading
comprehension ability. Participants were 78 university freshmen studying English language teaching, translation, and literature.
They were divided into two groups. The experimental group received a number of learning strategies adopted and adapted
by the researchers, including concept-mapping, vocabulary notebook, passage restatement, dictionary use, summary writing,
and guessing. The treatment was carried out 4 hr a week for 15 consecutive weeks. The Language Learners' Beliefs Scale,
developed and validated by Birjandi and Mohammadi, and the reading comprehension section of Cambridge Preliminary
English Test (PET) were administered before and after the treatment to identify the students' shifts in beliefs about language
learning and to measure reading comprehension ability, respectively. The results of independent t test indicated that the
instruction of learning strategies changed the university students' beliefs about language learning. Furthermore, learning
strategy instruction could boost their reading comprehension ability.

Benson and Lor (1999) also distinguished two different
categories: higher order conceptions and lower order beliefs.
They defined conceptions as "concerned with what the
learner thinks the objects and processes of learning are,"
whereas beliefs are "what the learner holds to be true about
these objects and processes" (p. 464).
Ellis (2004) divided the construct into two general levels:
higher order conceptions (epistemology) and lower order
beliefs. A number of studies, including Benson and Lor
(1999) and Tanaka (2004), have proposed that learners have
certain conceptions regarding what language is and how it is
learned. It contains three categories: quantitative/analytic,
qualitative/experiential, and self-efficacy/confidence.
Despite all these classifications, a point to consider is that
belief is culture-based in nature, and learners in any context
can have their own type of beliefs being shaped or reshaped
by means of a variety of sources. Learning strategy training
can be a case in point.
Learning Strategy Training
In the past 40 years or so, the literature on language learning
strategy research has witnessed a diversity of issues on its
path to reach the present status. Chamot (2004) introduced
eight such issues extracted from the literature of leaning
strategy in the literature. The first issue to discuss here is the
identification of language learning strategies. A substantial
body of literature is devoted to defining what learning strat-
egy is and identifying these unobservable mental learning
strategies. In English as a foreign language (EFL) context,
Richards and Schmidt (2010) simply defined learning strate-
gies as "the ways in which learners attempt to work out the
meanings and uses of words, grammatical rules, and other
aspects of the language they are learning" (p. 331). In Stern's
(1983) view, strategy is "best reserved for general tendencies
or overall characteristics of the approach employed by the
language learner, leaving techniques as the term to refer to
particular forms of observable learning behavior" (p. 236).
At the same time, Rubin (1987) asserted that learning strate-
gies are "strategies which contribute to the development of
the language system which the learner constructs and affect
learning directly" (p. 15). In her article, Oxford (1989)
referred to language learning strategies as "behaviors or
actions which learners use to make language learning more
successful, self-directed and enjoyable" (p. 235). Anderson
(2005) defined strategies as "the conscious actions that learn-
ers take to improve their language learning" (p. 757).
According to Chamot (2005), learning strategies are "proce-
dures that facilitate a learning task. Strategies are most often
conscious and goal-driven, especially in the beginning stages
of tackling an unfamiliar language task" (p. 112).
When the concept of learning strategy was investigated
and defined, it was time to devise some classifications
according to the conceptualization of the term learning strat-
egy. There are almost dozens of second language learning
strategy classifications. In Wenden's (1983) classification,
she identified three general categories of self-directing learn-
ing strategies: (a) knowing about language, (b) planning, and
(c) self-evaluation. Rubin (1987) suggested that there are
three kinds of strategies that contribute directly or indirectly
to language learning: learning strategies, communication
strategies, and social strategies. O'Malley and Chamot
(1990) proposed a framework in which three major types of
learning strategies are classified: metacognitive, cognitive,
and social/affective. Metacognitive strategies are the ones
that involve planning for learning, thinking about the learn-
ing process as it is taking place, monitoring of one's produc-
tion or comprehension, and evaluating learning after an
activity is completed. Cognitive strategies, according to
O'Malley and Chamot (1990), "are more directly related to
individual learning tasks and entails direct manipulation or
transformation of learning materials" (p. 8), strategies such
as repetition, translation, grouping, deduction, contextualiza-
tion, and transfer. Social/affective strategies concern interac-
tion with other learners and native speakers and management
of the affective demands made by language learning such as
cooperation, question for clarification, and self-talks.
Oxford's model of learning strategies is believed to be
one of the most comprehensive classifications (Brown, 2007;
Ellis, 1994). In Oxford's (1990) taxonomy, she distinguished
between direct and indirect strategies. The former consist of
"strategies that directly involve the target language . . . [in a
way that] require mental processing of the language" (p. 37).
The latter, however, "provide indirect support for language
learning through focusing, planning, evaluating seeking
opportunities, controlling anxiety, increasing cooperation
and empathy and other means" (p. 151). The strategies under
the first category (direct), according to Oxford, are memory
strategies, cognitive strategies, and compensation strategies.
Memory strategies, also called mnemonics, "enables learners
to store verbal material and then retrieve it when needed for
communication" (Oxford, 1990, p. 39). Cognitive strategies
vary a lot "ranging from repeating to analyzing expressions
to summarizing" (p. 43). Oxford (1990) identified four sets
of cognitive strategies: "1) Practicing, 2) Receiving and
sending messages, 3) Analyzing and reasoning, and 4)
Creatingstructureforinputandoutput"(p.17).Compensation
strategies, according to Oxford (1990), "enable learners to
use the new language for either comprehension or production
despite limitations in knowledge" (p. 47). The second cate-
gory (indirect) includes "actions which go beyond purely
cognitive devices, and which provide a way for learners to
coordinate their own learning process" (p. 136).
Stern (1992), furthermore, summarized and reclassified
his classification of 10 strategies, offered in Stern (1983),
into 5 main language learning strategies: (a) management
and planning strategies, (b) cognitive strategies, (c) commu-
nicative­experiential strategies, (d) interpersonal strategies,
and (e) affective strategies.
Another line of research in language learning strategy is the
relationship between learning strategy and the learner vari-
ables such as gender and level of language proficiency. Several
Mohammadi et al. 3
works were carried out to underline the role of gender (El-Dib,
2004; Kaylani, 1996; Oxford, Park-Oh, Ito, & Sumrall, 1993;
Vandergrift, 1997; Wharton, 2000); however, as Chamot
(2004) asserted, we cannot certainly confirm any role for gen-
der in learning strategy use.As for proficiency level, the results
tend to be convergent. The majority of the studies (Anderson,
2005; Bruen, 2001; Chamot & El-Dinary, 1999; Green &
Oxford, 1995; Mohammadi, 2009; O'Malley & Chamot,
1990; Wharton, 2000) revealed that students with more com-
mand of English are skillful users of learning strategies.
The next line in the language learning strategy research is
the fact that learning strategy use is culture- and context-
specific. The results of some studies underlined that the
adoption of strategies may vary among the learners in differ-
ent learning contexts and with various cultural values
(Keatley, Chamot, Spokane, & Greenstreet, 2004; Olivares-
Cuhat, 2002; Wharton, 2000).
One more research area in the literature of language learn-
ing strategy is the explicit instruction of strategy within such
frameworks as Strategy-Based Instruction or Learning
Strategy Training. Many scholars unanimously agree on the
usefulness of explicit instruction of strategy (Anderson,
2005; Butler, 1997; Chamot, Barnhardt, El-Dinary, &
Robbins, 1999; Cohen, 1998; Goh & Taib, 2006; Lam, 2009;
Nguyen & Gu, 2013; Nunan, 1997; O'Malley & Chamot,
1990; Oxford & Leaver, 1996; Rubin & McCoy, 2008; Shen,
2003). However, the integration or separation of strategy
training from other learning tasks is a source of contention.
Some argue for the integration of them (Chamot et al., 1999;
Chamot & O'Malley, 1994; Cohen, 1998; Grenfell & Harris,
1999; Nunan, 1997; Oxford & Leaver, 1996), whereas others
are for their separation (Gu, 1996; Vance, 1999; Weinstein &
Mayer, 1986). Rubin, Chamot, Harris, and Anderson (2007)
also introduced four core features of a strategy-based instruc-
tion model: (a) awareness raising, (b) presentation and mod-
eling, (c) providing multiple practice opportunities, and (d)
evaluating the effectiveness of strategies and transferring
them to new tasks.
There are some other research lines in the literature of
learning strategy such as the role of the language of instruc-
tion in teaching learning strategies and the transfer of strate-
gies to new tasks or to the rest of their education, which are
recently taken care of.
A closer look at the above discussions implies that learn-
ing strategies are not just an affective factor but a cognitive
factor as well, which are affected by cultural, social, and situ-
ational contexts of use. This study aimed to investigate the
answer to the following questions:
Research Question 1: Does teaching language learning
strategies have any significant effect on the beliefs of
Iranian EFL learners?
Research Question 2: Does teaching language learning
strategies have any significant effect on the reading com-
prehension ability of the Iranian EFL learners?
Method
Participants
The population of the study included all the students studying
English language at the faculty of Persian literature and foreign
languages in Islamic Azad University, Roudehen Branch in
Tehran. Out of them, two intact classes with a total of 92 stu-
dents were selected from among the freshman students who had
been admitted to the faculty using cluster random sampling. The
freshman students were selected because their beliefs about lan-
guage learning were all shaped in their school period, and the
change could be more significant. They were both male (n = 23)
and female (n = 55). To homogenize the students, a proficiency
test (Test of English as a Foreign Language [TOEFL]) was
administered to all of them. For the sake of practicality, only the
reading comprehension and structure sections were adminis-
tered. Based on the results, those at the extreme ends, standing
at the point more than one standard deviation below and above
the mean, were crossed out of the study. They were totally 78
students majoring in English language teaching, English lan-
guage translation, and English language literature ranging
between 19 and 31 years old with the mean index of 21.
Instrument
The research instrument in this study was Language Learners'
Beliefs Scale (LLBS; see the appendix) designed by Birjandi
and Mohammadi (2014), which has 32 items. To estimate the
reliability of the measure, as reported by Birjandi and
Mohammadi, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was calcu-
lated among a group of 328 university students, which came
to be .78. To investigate the construct validity, they subjected
the 32-item LLBS to principal components analysis (PCA)
using SPSS Version 16. The Kaiser­Meyer­Oklin (KMO)
measure of sampling adequacy was 0.74, and Bartlett's test
of sphericity had reached statistical significance supporting
the factorability of the correlation matrix. The results of five-
factor solution (Table 1) revealed a total of 36.52% of the
variance, with Components 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 contributing
14.61%, 6.67%, 5.53%, 5.06%, and 4.65%, respectively.
The underlying constructs that were considered in the scale
were Mediatory beliefs (seven items), Self-beliefs (eight items),
Attributive beliefs (six items), Traditional beliefs (six items),
and Epistemological beliefs (five items). Self-beliefs referred to
the beliefs about self-worth, self-concept, and self-efficacy,

whereas epistemological beliefs were designated to the beliefs
about the nature of knowledge of language and learning.
Attributive beliefs are beliefs about the causes of language
learning, and mediatory beliefs are composed of beliefs about
the role of mediators in language learning. Traditional beliefs
also refer to all the learning beliefs that are deeply rooted in
the traditional English language learning/teaching methodol-
ogy. The answer to the items of the LLBS was supposed to be
done on a 4-point Likert-type scale with 4 options for the
responses as strongly disagree, disagree, agree, or strongly
agree. For the ease of computation, the responses were
numerically coded 1 to 4, respectively.
The reading comprehension section of Cambridge
Preliminary English Test (PET) was also used as a pretest
and posttest to measure participants' reading comprehension
ability. It included 35 items in five different parts adminis-
tered in Sessions 1 and 16.
Procedure
Having homogenized the students and deselected those at both
extremes in the proficiency test, the researcher had two classes
of control (n = 38) and experimental (n = 40) groups. LLBS and
reading comprehension test, as pretests, were administered to
both classes to identify their beliefs about language learning and
their reading comprehension ability prior to the treatment. Both
of the classes were taught by one of the researchers so that the
impact of the teacher's cognition, bias, teaching methods, and
styles was nullified. The university syllabus for the course
required the course book called Active Skills for Reading Book
3 (Anderson, 2008, 2nd ed.). It should be mentioned here that
although verifying strategy is one of the six basic assumptions
of the book, the researchers decided to choose the course book
for two reasons: One is that what is claimed by the study is the
explicit instruction of learning strategies while it is not directly
claimed by the series' author. Second, the researchers' years of
experience revealed that the explicit teaching of learning strate-
gies is not a common practice of the teachers in the classes of
this type. In the experimental class, in addition to their class-
room syllabus, the students were presented a set of strategies.
Because the classes were both "Reading Comprehension," most
of the learning strategies presented in the experimental class
were in one way or another related to it and the related skills and
subskills. The researchers adopted and adapted a number of
learning strategies for the experimental class, including con-
cept-mapping, vocabulary notebook, passage restatement, dic-
tionary use, summary writing, and guessing.
In concept-mapping strategy, students were required to
identify important concepts in their passages and relate those
concepts to each other. Students were also asked to prepare a
vocabulary notebook for any new words they encountered in
lessons along with their synonyms and antonyms, collocations,
roots, and derivations. In passage restatement strategy, they
were supposed to restate the reading passage or the stories
assigned to them for their classmates. This strategy had two
different versions: one by restating the story from different
points of view or from the character's point of view and the
other by restricting them to use limited number of vocabulary
to restate the text. It also contained the story reproduction using
certain given keywords. The students were also taught the
proper use of monolingual dictionary and kept practicing it in
class. In summary writing strategy, to enhance their memory of
the main ideas, students were asked to write the summary of
their reading passages (at most one to three paragraphs) and
their story readings at home (more than five paragraphs). In
guessing strategy, they worked on the meaning of the keywords
in the passage and were encouraged to do the postreading activ-
ities guessing the other words through context, word roots, pre-
fixes, and suffixes. This way, their tolerance of ambiguity could
be fostered. At the end of the semester (with a 15-week inter-
val), the LLBS and reading comprehension test were adminis-
tered again to check the probable changes in learners' beliefs
about language learning and reading comprehension abilities.
Data Analysis and Discussion
To answer the research questions, the data from the adminis-
trations of LLBS to both experimental and control groups
were collected as the pretest and posttest. Independent-
samples t tests were run to compare the experimental and
control groups' means on the pretest and posttest of beliefs.
Before discussing the results, it should be mentioned that the
assumption of normality--a prerequisite to independent-
samples t test--was met (Table 2). The ratios of skewness
and kurtosis over their respective standard errors were
"within the ranges of ± 1.96" (Field, 2009).
The assumption of homogeneity of variance will be discussed
when reporting the results of the independent-samples t test.
The data on pretests were, then, analyzed. Independent t
test was run to compare the experimental and control groups'
mean scores on pretest of beliefs to prove that the two groups
held the same beliefs prior to the main study. As displayed in
Table 3, the mean scores for experimental and control groups
on pretest of beliefs were 13.90 and 13.94, respectively.

The results of the independent t test, t(76) = 0.107, p >
.05, and the effect size, r = .012, representing a weak effect
size according to Field (2009), indicated that there was no
significant difference between experimental and control
groups' mean scores on the pretest of beliefs. Thus, it can be
concluded that the two groups enjoyed the same level of
beliefs prior to the main study.
It should be noted that the assumption of homogeneity of
variances was met (Levene's F = .413, p = .522 > .05). That
is why the first row of Table 4, that is, "Equal variances
assumed," was reported. Figure 1 represents the homogene-
ity of pretest for both groups.
Next, the posttests were analyzed. An independent t test
was run to compare the experimental and control groups'
mean scores on posttest of beliefs to probe the effect of
teaching learning strategies on the shifts in their beliefs about
language learning. As displayed in Table 5, the mean scores
for experimental and control groups on posttest of beliefs
were 15.80 and 14.54, respectively.
The results of the independent t test, t(76) = 2.73, p < .05,
and the effect size, r = .29, representing an almost moderate
effect size according to Field (2009), indicate that there was
a significant but moderate difference between experimental
and control groups' mean scores on the posttest. Thus, it can
be concluded the null hypothesis as teaching language learn-
ing strategies does not have any significant effect on the
beliefs Iranian EFL learners possess is rejected although the
results should be interpreted cautiously due to the moderate
effect size value of the t statistic.
It should be noted that the assumption of homogeneity of
variances was met (Levene's F = 2, p = .161 > .05). That is
why the first row of Table 6, that is, "Equal variances
assumed" was reported. Figure 2 represents the heterogene-
ity of posttest for both groups.
To answer the second research question, the data on read-
ing comprehension pretests were analyzed. Independent t
test was run to compare the experimental and control groups'
mean scores on pretest of reading comprehension to prove
that the two groups held the same ability prior to the main
study. As displayed in Table 7, the mean scores for experi-
mental and control groups on pretest of reading comprehen-
sion were 13.71 and 13.94, respectively.
An independent-samples t test was conducted to compare
the scores of reading comprehension pretests for control and
experimental classes. The results showed that there was no
significant difference in reading comprehension scores for
control group (M = 13.94, SD = 1.89) and experimental
group (M = 13.71, SD = 2.23), t(78) = -0.5, p = .62, two-
tailed (Table 8). The magnitude of the differences in the
means, according to Cohen (1988), was very small (2 =
.003).
The data on reading comprehension posttests were also
analyzed. Independent t test was run to compare the experi-
mental and control groups' mean scores on posttest of read-
ing comprehension to investigate the effect of teaching
language learning strategies on the students' reading com-
prehension ability. As displayed in Table 9, the mean scores
for experimental and control groups on pretest of reading
comprehension were 15.8 and 14.35, respectively.

An independent-samples t test was conducted to compare
the scores of reading comprehension posttests for control
and experimental classes. The results showed that there was
a significant difference in reading comprehension scores for
control group (M = 14.3, SD = 2.34) and experimental group
(M = 15.8, SD = 1.93), t(78) = 2.97, p = .004, two-tailed
(Table 10). The magnitude of the differences in the means,
according to Cohen (1988), was very large (2 = 0.1).
The results of the present study, first and foremost, sup-
port the usefulness of explicit instruction of strategy as
already proposed by some scholars (Anderson, 2005; Butler,
1997; Chamot et al., 1999; Cohen, 1998; De Silva, 2014;
Goh & Taib, 2006; Gu, 2007; Nguyen & Gu, 2013; Nunan,
1997; O'Malley & Chamot, 1990; Oxford & Leaver, 1996;
Rubin & McCoy, 2008; Shen, 2003). Change in the learners'
beliefs about language learning as a result of teaching
language learning strategies could lead to familiarizing the
learners with what the nature of language is and how it is
learned. The instruction of learning strategies was integrated
with the linguistic content classroom tasks, and the results
were in line with those proposed by some scholars who argue
for their integration (Chamot et al., 1999; Chamot &
O'Malley, 1994; Cohen, 1998; Grenfell & Harris, 1999;
Nunan, 1997; Oxford & Leaver, 1996). The findings also
proved a shift in the learners'beliefs about language learning
and endorsed the results of the study by Yang (1992) who
indicated that learning "strategies can cause beliefs as well"
(p. 148).
Conclusion and Implications
This study was an attempt to examine the effect of teaching
learning strategies on learners' beliefs about language learn-
ing and their reading comprehension ability. The findings of
the study can be categorized into two parts: the effects of
learning strategies on both changes in learners' beliefs and
their dynamicity and their reading comprehension ability.
The results of this study indicated that strategy-rich class-
rooms can enrich the students' beliefs and develop their cog-
nition about language learning. There are two groups of
studies in the literature adopting language learning beliefs
and language learning strategies as the major variable. The
first group examined the effects of learning beliefs on stu-
dents' language learning strategies (Abraham & Vann, 1987;
Elbaum, Berg, & Dodd, 1993; Riley, 1997; Yang, 1992) and
unanimously agreed that language learning beliefs can influ-
ence learning strategy use. The second group has examined
the relationship between beliefs about language learning and
learning strategy use (Abedini, Rahimi, & Zare-ee, 2011;
Chang & Shen, 2010; Li, 2010; Su, 1995; Yang, 1999; Yu,
2007; Zare-ee, 2010). It means that this study can be a pio-
neer work because, as mentioned above, there has been no
such study in the literature as far as the researchers could
access.
The results of this study are also significant when the
learners' beliefs have changed during a short term. The lit-
erature has witnessed two groups of studies in this respect:
One is related to those which claim that belief is stable,
inflexible, and resistant to change that was once favorably

prevalent in many scientific studies (e.g., Almarza, 1996;
Freeman, 1992; Guillaume & Rudney, 1993; Horwitz, 1987,
1988; Johnson, 1996; Kennedy, 1991; Nettle, 1998; Su,
1995; Tumposky, 1991; Yang, 1992). For them, education is
believed to be ineffective in changing or influencing the
beliefs. The second group is related to those which concluded
that beliefs at micro-level (short time) are not changing and
are very stable at the group level (e.g., Kern, 1995). The
results of this study have no commonalities with those in
both of the above groups. However, it is in line with the
results of a few studies that ended up with significant changes
in learners' beliefs at 1-year intervals or shorter (Amuzie &
Winke, 2009; Lim, Pagram, & Nastiti, 2009; Oh, 1996;
Sugiyama, 2003; Tanaka & Ellis, 2003).
This study was conducted among university students with
more or less established beliefs about language learning. It
can be carried out among language learners of different pro-
ficiency levels. Also, belief changes here were investigated
from an emic rather than etic perspective, which can be a
suggestion for further studies. Furthermore, the future stud-
ies can be on the investigation of macro-dynamicity of
beliefs about language learning rather than micro-dynamic-
ity, which was adopted by this study.
The results of this study enjoy certain implications for the
stakeholders in language education. Teachers are suggested
to equip students with the strategies for better learning along
with the course content. This is helpful for the students not
only to be a "good language learner" but also to improve
their autonomy and self-efficacy. The message for the teach-
ers is that students' beliefs can be shaped or reshaped if there
are meditational tools such as strategies for language learn-
ing. Syllabus designers are also recommended to include
learning strategies within the syllabus. If these strategies are
reinforced by the course books all through the syllabus, stu-
dents' beliefs are formed and reformed more systematically.
Only this can revive the hope that an educational system is
stepping toward its ultimate goal, which is educating
students for the future.
