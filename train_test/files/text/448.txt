Abstract
Although program recipients' attitudes toward
instructors are crucial to program outcomes,
they have not been adequately examined in the
substance abuse prevention literature. This study
uses survey data to explore attitudes toward
instructors of prevention programming held by
students from a national longitudinal evaluation
of a school-based substance abuse prevention
program delivered by Drug Abuse Resistance
Education (D.A.R.E.) officers. Our analyses indi-
cated that students who had police officers as
instructors evaluated program instructors signif-
icantly higher than students who had non-police
officers as instructors. The evaluation of police
instructors varied according to students' socio-
demographic characteristics. Implications for
future research and practice are considered.
Introduction
Program recipients' acceptance of and reaction to
information presented in prevention curricula de-
pend, among other things, on their trust in and their
perceived credibility of program instructors. There-
fore, as suggested by the Elaboration Likelihood
Model (ELM) [1, 2], the effectiveness of prevention
programs to some extent might depend on program
recipients' attitudes toward instructors. Although
attitudes toward program instructors are crucial to
program success, they have not been adequately
examined in the literature.
Studies that document the types of substance
abuse prevention programs delivered in the nation's
schools indicate that Drug Abuse Resistance Edu-
cation (D.A.R.E.) programs are delivered in ;80%
of all school districts [3]. Given that police officers
deliver D.A.R.E. and other school-based prevention
programs, it is important to consider whether stu-
dents' attitudes toward police instructors influence
the success of prevention programming. Moreover,
students' attitudes toward police instructors of pre-
vention programs have not been fully examined.
Studies of the effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. deliv-
ery network have examined the effect on students'
attitudes toward police officers in general [4­7]. A
dominant finding from these studies is that students
exposed to D.A.R.E. officers tend to have positive
attitudes toward police officers in general. How-
ever, these studies did not consider the factors influ-
encing the observed attitudes or their relation to
attitudes toward police officer instructors. Other
limitations of these studies are that they focus on
specific geographic locations and only on elemen-
tary school students, particularly fifth and sixth
graders.
Against the backdrop of these limitations is an
ongoing debate in prevention research on wheth-
er police officers should deliver drug prevention

programs. This question is very important given
that a large body of literature exists elsewhere in-
dicating that in general adolescents have negative
attitudes toward police officers [8­15]. This litera-
ture suggests that the presence of police officers in
schools is likely to pose a psychological threat to,
and alienate, students who already have negative
attitudes toward them [11].
This study addresses the limitations of and builds
on previous research by exploring adolescents' atti-
tudes toward instructors of substance use preven-
tion programs. Specifically, the study explores
differences in students' attitudes toward police
instructors of drug prevention programs in six met-
ropolitan areas in the United States of America.
The key questions addressed in this study are as
follows:
(i) What are students' attitudes toward instructors
of drug prevention programs?
(ii) Are students' attitudes toward program instructors
different for police and non-police instructors?
(iii) Are there variations in students' attitudes to-
ward police instructors according to:
(a) Their general attitudes toward the police?
(b) Their prior exposure to the D.A.R.E. program?
(c) Their sociodemographic characteristics?
(d) The sociodemographic characteristics of their
neighborhoods?
Factors influencing adolescents'
attitudes toward police officers
Studies examining adolescents' attitudes toward the
police have indicated that individual characteristics,
neighborhood conditions and type of encounters
with the police are key factors influencing such atti-
tudes. Among the individual characteristics shaping
adolescents' attitudes toward the police are gender,
deviance and race. For instance, delinquent adoles-
cents are noted to have more negative attitudes to-
ward the police [16, 17]. Similarly, non-White
adolescents are reported to have more negative atti-
tudes toward the police than White adolescents [15,
16, 18]. This general tendency to view the police
negatively on the part of adolescents varies not only
across race and gender [15, 16, 18­21] but across
dimensions of evaluation as well. For example,
based on semantic differentials, Moretz [22] con-
cludes that ``students in the present study saw them
(the police) as a valuable agency in society'' (223).
Furthermore, Moretz argues that the police, while
viewed as potent and valuable, are not well under-
stood by adolescents.
Adolescents residing in suburban neighborhoods
and/or smaller cities are reported to have more pos-
itive attitudes toward the police than their counter-
parts residing in other areas [10, 12, 23]. Research
has also demonstrated the importance of individu-
als' perceptions of conditions in their neighbor-
hoods in shaping their attitudes toward the police.
People perceiving their neighborhood conditions as
`bad' tend to have more negative attitudes toward
the police than those with positive perceptions of
their neighborhoods [8, 12, 16].
The nature of contacts between the public and the
police as well as public perceptions of these con-
tacts have also been found to affect attitudes toward
the police [9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 24]. Adolescents who
have had prior involuntary encounters with the po-
lice (such as being arrested or stopped for traffic
violations) have more negative attitudes toward
the police than adolescents with prior voluntary
encounters [24]. Generally, adolescents who have
frequent contacts with the police in a supportive
context are found to have more positive attitudes
toward the police [13, 17]. Negative experiences
with police appear prominently in the literature de-
scribing attitudes toward the police. Hurst et al. [21]
find that the most powerful predictor of negative
attitudes toward the police, for girls, is vicarious
police misconduct. That is, knowledge of police
misconduct was a more powerful predictor of neg-
ative attitudes toward the police than were age,
race, school type or victimization experience. Fur-
thermore, Cox and Falkenberg [20] conclude that
negative interactions with police by substance abus-
ing youth result in more negative attitudes toward
the police. In contrast to this trend, Esbensen
and Osgood [25] in their evaluation of the Gang
Attitudes toward instructors of prevention programs

Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) pro-
gram find that program participants had significantly
more positive attitudes toward the police than did
members of a comparison group, in two of the three
samples under investigation. It is important to note
that the GREAT program was developed based upon
the D.A.R.E. model [25]. Consequently, the positive
classroom interactions with police officers that ado-
lescents experience in the GREAT program and that
result in their more positive attitudes toward the
police may operate similarly for D.A.R.E.
Most of the studies on adolescents' attitudes to-
ward the police are limited to specific geographic
locations and populations, particularly Blacks or
comparisons between Blacks and Whites in urban
communities [26]. Consequently, the question of
applicability of the findings to other settings and
contexts remains unanswered. In addition, the ef-
fect of other factors on attitudes toward the police
has not been compelling. For instance, while some
studies indicate differences in attitudes toward the
police by gender [8­10, 14, 23], others have indi-
cate no differences in attitudes toward the police by
gender [12, 19, 27].
Methods
The conceptual model of this study is based on the
argument that the effectiveness of prevention pro-
grams to some extent might depend on the periph-
eral route of persuasion as elucidated by the ELM
[1, 2]. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to
examine attitudes toward instructors of prevention
programs overall, then determine whether attitudes
toward program instructors differ when the instruc-
tor is a police officer or not. A key hypothesis of the
study is that students' general attitudes toward po-
lice officers will be predictive of their evaluation of
police officers as instructors. Specifically, it was
expected that students with positive attitudes to-
ward police officers would have positive attitudes
toward police instructors. As past research indicates
that students exposed to the D.A.R.E. program tend
to have more positive attitudes toward police offi-
cers, it was further hypothesized that prior exposure
to the D.A.R.E. program would positively affect atti-
tudes toward police officers in general. Considering
that adolescents' attitudes toward police officers may
be shaped by sociodemographic characteristics, it
was also hypothesized that subgroups of students
with different individual-level and neighborhood-
level sociodemographic characteristics would also
have different attitudes toward police instructors.
These hypotheses are illustrated in Fig. 1.
Data
Data used for this study were drawn from the Ad-
olescent Substance Abuse Prevention Study
(A.S.A.P.S.). The A.S.A.P.S. has been described
in details elsewhere [28]. In brief, it uses a random-
ized experimental design to explore the effective-
ness of an innovative adolescent substance abuse
prevention program delivered by D.A.R.E. officers
to students when they are in the seventh and ninth
grades. The A.S.A.P.S. is a 5-year, prospective,
longitudinal study of a cohort of seventh graders
during the 2001/2002 school year attending public
schools in six metropolitan areas across the United
States of America (Los Angeles, CA; Houston, TX;
St Louis, MO; Detroit, MI; Newark, NJ and New
Orleans, LA). The selected school districts consist-
ing of 83 high schools (9th­12th grade) and all their
122 feeder middle schools (sixth­eighth grade)
were randomly drawn from a universe of school
districts stratified by stress (defined by the propor-
tions of district students eligible for the free lunch
program and who represent minority groups) and
then randomly assigned to either experimental or
control conditions. Active parental consent and stu-
dent assent procedures secured a 71% return rate.
Baseline survey data were completed when students
were in the seventh grade in the 2001/2002 school
year. Seven survey waves were planned with the
final wave occurring when the students were in
the 11th grade in the 2005/2006 school year. The
seven survey waves are seventh grade posttest,
eighth grade, ninth grade pre- and posttest,
10th grade and 11th grade. With the primary sam-
pling unit being high schools and the middle
schools feeding into the respective high schools,

the movement of students from middle schools to
high schools does not pose a possible confound prob-
lem. Survey data are available for 19 200 students.
The program being evaluated, Take Charge of
Your Life, incorporates current empirical evidence
on content and program characteristics shown to be
effective in delaying the onset and reducing the
trajectories over time of substance use [tobacco,
alcohol, marijuana and other illicit drugs or Alcohol,
Tobacco and other Drugs (ATOD)]. The program
specifically targets: normative beliefs regarding the
perceived prevalence of substance use among teens,
consequences of substance use and strengthening life
skills including decision making, communications
and refusal skills. The curriculum is based on a model
of prevention that suggests that challenging existing
beliefs through the use of objective data (e.g. survey
data from Monitoring the Future) lead students to
an adjustment in their perceptions of the rates of
peer use and in the level of acceptance of substance
use by those who are important to them and the real-
life personal, social and legal consequences of
ATOD use for adolescents. Students are then given
opportunities to apply this new information in
hypothetical authentic scenarios using a decision-
making algorithm with the anticipated outcome be-
ing more negative attitudes toward substance use
and consequently stronger intentions not to use to-
bacco, alcohol, marijuana or other drugs. Finally,
students learn refusal and communication skills and
practice these skills through role-play with their in-
structor and peers with the goal of following
through on the decision not to use these substances.
Analytical sample
The analytical sample for the current study consists
of a subset of students (n = 6069) in both the treat-
ment and control conditions who reported on a

drug education program when they were in the
ninth grade. Table I presents descriptive informa-
tion for the analytical sample. The sample ranged in
age from 10 to 16 [M = 12.41, standard error (SE)
= 0.030] years at baseline with a slight majority
(58.5%) reporting that they were female. The sam-
ple was racially diverse with 43.7% reporting
that they were White. A majority of the students
attended schools in non-urban communities (94.8%)
and reported having police officers as instructors of
their drug education programs when they were in
the ninth grade (78.3%). The percentage of students
attending schools in non-urban communities in this
sample is higher than that in the original sample
(87.5%). While most of the students were exposed
to the D.A.R.E. program prior to the seventh grade
(76.6%), relatively fewer students had the D.A.R.E.
program at seventh (49.9) grade and at eighth
(29.2%) grade.

Measures
The outcome of interest for these analyses was stu-
dents' attitudes toward program instructors (which
include both police and non-police instructors).
Attitudes toward program instructors were mea-
sured using four 5-point Likert-type scale items re-
lating to students' evaluation of instructors of drug
prevention programs delivered when the students
were in the ninth grade. The responses to the four
items ranged from `disagree' = 1 to `agree' = 5 and
had factor loadings ranging from 0.76 to 0.85.
Table II provides a detailed description of the meas-
ures used in this study.
Seven individual-level and two neighborhood-
level sociodemographic characteristics are used as
independent variables in this study. The individual-
level factors are age, gender, race, deviance, drug
use, attitudes toward police officers in general and
exposure to the D.A.R.E. program. Students' age
was measured in years when students were in the
seventh grade. Gender was coded `female' = 0 and
`male' = 1, and race was dummy coded with
`White' as the reference group.
A composite measure of students' deviant behav-
ior at seventh grade (M = 1.15, SE = 0.009) and
ninth grade (M = 1.29, SE = 0.014) was constructed

using four 5-point Likert scale items. Responses
to the items, which relate to students' involvement
in behaviors such as group violence and theft in
the past year, ranged from `not at all' = 1 to `more
than five times' = 5. The factor loadings for this
scale were high for both seventh (0.61­0.68) and
ninth (0.82­0.89) grades. The distribution of the
mean score of the measure was highly skewed to
the extent that most of the students (77.2% at
seventh and 71.3% at ninth grades) indicated that
they have not been involved in deviant behaviors.
The skewed nature of this measure indicates the
presence of two categories of deviant students;
deviant and non-deviant. Using a natural split, the
mean score of the four items was dichotomized into
`deviant' = 1 and `non-deviant' = 0 at the seventh
and ninth grades (such that students with a mean
score of 1 were considered non-deviant and those
with a mean score >1 were considered deviant).
To reflect changes in deviant behavior over the
period, the dichotomized measure at the seventh
and ninth grades were combined to create a dummy
variable with non-deviant students at both the
seventh and ninth grades as the reference group.
While we lose some information by dichotomizing
the measure, the skewed nature of this measure
justifies the dichotomization process [29].
Drug use was measured based on students' self-
report of ever using three different drugs (cigarettes,
alcohol and marijuana) during the 30 days prior to
the time of survey completion. Students who
reported using any of the three drugs at any of the
waves prior to the ninth grade posttest were identi-
fied as having prior drug use (coded 1) and those
who reported not using any of the drugs at any of
the waves prior to the ninth grade posttest were
considered to have no prior drug use (coded 0).
The waves prior to ninth grade posttest are seventh
grade pre- and posttests, eighth grade follow-up and
ninth grade pretest.
Attitudes toward police officers were measured
using two 5-point Likert-type scale items relating to
the duties of police officers at the seventh, eighth
and ninth grades. Students' responses to each of the
items ranged from `disagree` = 1 to `agree` = 5.
One of the items was negatively worded and the
response was reverse coded to ensure that higher
scores indicate more positive attitudes. Consistent
with prior research [23], a composite score of atti-
tudes toward police officers was constructed by av-
eraging each student's response to the two items.
Exposure to the D.A.R.E. program was a dichot-
omous measure of students receiving the D.A.R.E.
programs prior to the seventh grade, during seventh
grade or during eighth grade. It was coded as `no
exposure to the D.A.R.E. program' = 0 and `expo-
sure to the D.A.R.E. program' = 1. Instructor type
was assessed by category of instructors who deliv-
ered drug education curriculum at the ninth grade
and was coded as `non-police' = 0 and `police'
= 1. The non-police instructors consist of teachers
(n = 541) and other instructors (n = 737) who de-
livered diverse drug prevention programs.
The two neighborhood-level characteristics were
school location and school-level stress, where the
students' schools are used to reflect neighborhood
sociodemographic characteristics. School location
was assessed by whether the school district is
located in the six inner cities (urban) or outside
of the inner cities (non-urban). It was coded as
`non-urban` = 0 and `urban` = 1. School-level
stress was constructed by a measure of poverty
(proportion of students in a school district qualified
to receive free lunch) and coded `low stress' (25%
or less students receiving free lunch) = 0 and `higher
stress' (>25% students receiving free lunch) = 1.
Analyses
First, to examine student attitudes toward preven-
tion program instructors, a detailed table of the stu-
dents responses to the four items presented in the
survey was generated. Next, to determine if attitudes
toward the program instructor changed when the in-
structor was a police officer, independent t-tests were
used. Differences in the means of each of the four
items and the combined mean score for all four items
were tested across students who had received pre-
vention instruction from a police officer and students
who had instruction from non-police instructors.
Structural equation modeling (S.E.M.) was
then used to test the hypothesized relationships
A. Hammond et al.
688
between students' attitudes toward police instruc-
tors and the students' general attitudes toward the
police, prior exposure to the D.A.R.E. program,
and students' individual level and individual-level
and neighborhood-level sociodemographic char-
acteristics as illustrated in Fig. 1. Since the focus
of these analyses was students' evaluation of po-
lice instructors, only students who had police offi-
cers as instructors of prevention programs were
included.
To better understand how the hypothesized
school-level independent variables effected stu-
dents' attitudes toward police instructors and their
relationship to the individual-level independent var-
iables, two S.E.M.'s were estimated in a stepwise
fashion, first estimating the individual- (within)
level independent variable effects, then adding the
school- (between) level independent variables. The
adequacy of the S.E.M.'s was evaluated using mul-
tiple indices of fit [the chi-square difference test;
comparative fit index (CFI); Tucker­Lewis fit
index (TLI); root mean square error of approxima-
tion (RMSEA) and standardized root mean square
residual (SRMR)] as recommended by Hu and
Bentler [30].
Prior to evaluating the conceptual model, a con-
firmatory factor analysis using the four items mea-
suring student attitudes toward police instructors as
observed indicators of a single latent construct was
conducted. The factor loadings for the four ob-
served indicators measuring attitudes toward police
officers ranged from 0.763 to 0.850 (see Table II),
above the 0.40 commonly used factor loading cut-
off value, demonstrating adequate convergent val-
idity of the latent construct for student attitudes
toward police instructors.
As the A.S.A.P.S. used a cluster sampling plan
(students nested within schools), the descriptive
and difference of means analyses were performed
using the survey (svy) commands in Stata 8.2 [31],
which accounts for clustering and provides unbi-
ased standard errors for parameter estimates. For
the S.E.M.'s, clustering was handled by multilevel
modeling using version 4.2 of M-plus [32]. In this
approach, a model for each level of the data, in-
dividual (within) and school (between) is specified,
accounting for the nested nature of the data due to
cluster sampling.
As with most longitudinal studies, the data set
contained missing values. Apart from the fact that
one high school district dropped out of the larger
study, ;37% (n = 7167 of 19 200) of the students
in the original sample were lost by the ninth grade
posttest. There was also a small amount of within-
survey missingness. To address the problem of
missing data, a multiple imputation approach was
used. Using the NORM program [33], the missing
values in the data set were simulated multiple times,
producing 10 equally plausible versions of the com-
plete data set. Each of these data sets was analyzed
in the same way, using the statistical methods de-
tailed above. The results were then combined using
Rubin's [34] rules for scalar estimates to produce
overall estimates and standard errors that incorpo-
rate missing data uncertainty.
Results
Students' attitudes toward prevention
instructors
Table III describes attitudes toward program instruc-
tors held by the students in this study. As indicated
earlier, attitudes toward instructors of prevention
programs were measured by four items with higher
scores indicating more positive attitudes (see Table II).
The majority of the students agreed (`kind of agree'
and `agree') that prevention program instructors un-
derstood kid's world (63.1%), were easy to talk to
(54.7%), gave real information (75.8%) and were
enthusiastic (63.9%). Both the mean response for
the four items (ranged from 3.48 to 4.10) and the
overall mean score (3.74) were greater than the
midpoint of the 5-point scale. The higher mean
score of responses as well as the majority of the
students selecting the more favorable responses to
each of the four items (`kind of agree' and `agree')
suggest that on average, the students in this study
were somewhat positive in their evaluation of
instructors of prevention programs. Next, we inves-
tigate whether these positive evaluations hold for
both police and non-police instructors alike.

Differences in attitudes toward prevention
instructors
Table IV presents difference of means test of atti-
tudes toward program instructors. As reported in
Table IV, the observed positive attitudes toward pre-
vention program instructors were different for police
and non-police instructors. Students who had police
officers as prevention instructors had a significantly
higher mean score for all the four items (ranging
from 3.53 to 4.17) than students who had non-police
instructors (ranging from 3.26 to 3.80). The effect
sizes (Cohen's d) for these differences ranged from
0.052 to 0.136. Similarly, the overall mean score for
the four items was significantly higher (3.79) for
students with police instructors than their counter-
parts with non-police instructors (3.53) with an effect
size of 0.083. In effect, students in this study who
had police instructors reported significantly more
positive attitudes toward program instructors than
students who had non-police instructors.
Students' attitudes toward police
instructors
To explore whether attitudes toward police officer
instructors vary according to students' sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, analyses were conducted
using two-level S.E.M. in the M-Plus program.
As shown in Table V, the measures of fit indices
suggest the individual-level model fits the data well
(CFI = 0.976; TLI = 0.959; and RMSEA = 0.029;
and SRMR = 0.013). Though the chi-square differ-
ence test is the most commonly used fit index for
assessing model fit, this study used indexes other
than the chi-square. This is because the chi-square
is influenced by large sample sizes and considering
that these analyses are based on a large sample
(n = 6069), the chi-square might not be an ideal
measure of model fit. For a detailed exposition con-
cerning assessment of model fit see Hu and Bentler
[30, 35] and Marsh et al. [36].
Individual-level analyses
Attitudes toward the police
The mean level of students' attitudes toward police
officers from the seventh grade through to the ninth
grade was 3.45 out of a possible score of 5 and is
considered to be positive. In effect, the students have
somewhat positive attitudes toward police officers in
general. Though students' attitudes toward police
officers declined over the period (slope = À0.10),
their overall attitudes remained generally positive.
Exposure to D.A.R.E. and attitudes toward
the police
Exposures to the D.A.R.E. program in prior years
were significant positive predictors of attitudes toward
police officers in general in subsequent years. For
instance, students exposed to the D.A.R.E. program
prior to seventh grade tended to report more positive
evaluation of police officers in general at seventh
grade (b = 0.488, P < 0.001) than their counterparts
who were not exposed to the D.A.R.E. program prior
to seventh grade. Similar findings were observed for
the effect of exposure to the D.A.R.E. program at
seventh and eighth grades on attitudes toward police
officers at eighth and ninth grades, respectively.

The intercept for attitudes toward police officers
in general was significantly positive for attitudes
toward police instructors (b = 0.488, P < 0.001).
Similarly, the slope for attitudes toward police offi-
cers in general was significantly positive for atti-
tudes toward police instructors (b = 0.097,
P < 0.001). That is, both the average level and rate
of change of students' attitudes toward the police in
general, from the seventh grade through to the ninth
grade, were significant and positive predictors of
their attitudes toward police instructors. In effect,
students with more positive attitudes toward police
officers in general tended to evaluate police instruc-
tors of prevention programs more positively. More-
over, these positive attitudes toward police officers
in general significantly predicted increases in posi-
tive attitudes toward program instructors, over time.
Drug use
Analysis of the individual-level model suggests that
students' prior drug use has consistent effects on
their attitudes toward police instructors of preven-
tion programs. Controlling for all other factors,
students who have used any of the drugs examined
(cigarette, alcohol and marijuana) prior to the ninth
grade reported significantly more negative attitudes
toward police instructors of prevention programs.
That is, police instructors tended to receive negative
evaluations among the students who have used
cigarette, alcohol or marijuana during at least one
wave before the ninth grade posttest. This finding is
not surprising considering that underage use of drugs
(both legal and illegal) is a crime. This is probably
because students who have used any of the drugs
have either encountered the police in a negative con-
text (such as being arrested) or have a greater fear of
encountering the police in a negative context.
Deviance
Compared with students who reported low levels of
deviance at both seventh and ninth grades, students
reporting higher levels of deviance at both grades
reported significantly negative attitudes toward po-
lice instructors (b = À0.269, P < 0.001). Similarly,
students involved in higher deviance at ninth grade
only reported significantly more negative evaluation
of police instructors than those reporting lower levels
at both seventh and ninth grades (b = À0.321, P <
0.001). However, there was no statistically signifi-
cant difference in the evaluation of police instructors
by students involved in higher deviance at seventh
grade only and their counterparts involved in lower
deviance at both seventh and ninth grades (À0.043,
ns). It appears from this finding that students cur-
rently involved in deviant behaviors may perceive
police officers skeptically; hence their negative atti-
tudes toward police officer instructors.
Race/ethnicity
Contrary to findings from previous studies [15, 16,
18], there was no statistically significant difference
in the evaluation of police instructors by White

Gender
Compared with their male counterparts, female stu-

School-level modeling
The measures of fit indices suggest the multilevel
model fits the data well (see Table VI). While
school location had statistically significant positive
effect on attitudes toward police instructors
(b = 1.134, P < 0.001), school stress did not have
significant effect on attitudes toward police instruc-
tors (b = 0.473, ns). That is, students attending
schools in urban communities tended to have more
positive attitudes toward police instructors than
their peers in non-urban schools. This result is con-
trary to expectation and further research is needed
to identify the possible causes.
Apart from slight changes in the effect sizes, the
inclusion of the school-level factors resulted in
changes in the significance of the effect of some
individual-level factors on attitudes toward police
instructors. While there was no statistically signif-
icant difference in students evaluation of police
instructors based on their race, Latino students
reported negative evaluation of police instructors,
relative to White students, when the school-level
factors were included in the model. On the other

Discussion
This study attempts to understand students' atti-
tudes toward police officer instructors of drug pre-
vention programs. The findings from this study
suggest that students have somewhat positive eval-
uations of instructors of prevention programs. The
study also suggests that students differ in their eval-
uation of instructors of prevention programs
according to instructor type. Police instructors of
prevention programs tended to enjoy more positive
evaluation among students than did non-police
instructors. This finding and evidence that adoles-
cents have negative attitudes toward police officers
in general [8­15] led us to believe that police offi-
cers as instructors enjoy more positive evaluation
from adolescents than in their traditional role as law
enforcers. This is likely due to the more positive
interaction that takes place between the police offi-
cer instructors and students in the classroom as op-
posed to the likely hostile encounters with the

police that typically occur in other law enforcement
activities. Besides, with the view that the police are
not well understood by adolescents [22] and are
thus likely to be perceived negatively by adoles-
cents, it is possible that students who encountered
the police in the classroom tended to understand the
police better and evaluate them positively.
The positive attitudes toward police instructors
held by students were not uniform across subgroups
of students. The negative relationships between
attitudes toward police instructors and students'
drug use and involvement in deviant behaviors ap-
pear to suggest that students involved in `illegal'
activities hold negative evaluations of police
instructors, relative to their peers not involved in
`illegal' activities. It is probably because this cate-
gory of students fears being arrested by the police
or has experienced negative encounters with the
police.
This study also highlights the importance of con-
textual factors in understanding students' attitudes
toward police instructors. Due possibly to positive
interactions between students and police officer
instructors, past studies have demonstrated that
the D.A.R.E. program has improved the image of
police officers among adolescents. However, these
effects may vary in different contexts and for dif-
ferent subgroups of students. As a result, in drawing
such a conclusion one has to take into consideration
students' characteristics and the context within
which they interact with the police.
Limitations
The findings from this study must be interpreted
with caution due to some limitations. The effect
of the D.A.R.E. program on attitudes toward police
officers is based on the assumption that students
who have had prior exposure to the D.A.R.E. pro-
gram have encountered police (D.A.R.E.) officers
in a supportive context and thus are more likely to
evaluate police officers favorably. Though students
might have had several encounters with the police
in diverse settings and conditions, the data set used
for this study did not include these measures, and
students' encounters with the police were measured
in the narrow context of prior exposure to D.A.R.E.
program. It seems unlikely, however, that these un-
measured encounters would bias students toward
more positive opinions of police instructors. It
seems more plausible that these unmeasured expe-
riences are negative and would suppress rather than
explain the correlations we found in this project.
Second, though students in this study who had
police instructors tended to evaluate program
instructors more positively than students who had
non-police instructors, this study does not claim
that the positive evaluation translates into positive
program effect. That is, this study is not suggesting
that students who had police officers as instructors
of prevention program had better outcomes on sub-
stance use than their counterparts who had non-po-
lice instructors. This issue must be addressed by
further research.
Further, while the individual characteristics of
the instructor such as race and gender are likely to
impact students' evaluation of the instructors, this
information was available for only police instruc-
tors who delivered the Take Charge of Your Life
program and could not be included in the analyses.
It is suggested that future studies gather information
on individual characteristics of instructors and con-
sider the possible effect of these characteristics on
students' evaluation of the instructors.
Implications
Notwithstanding these limitations, the findings
have provided insight into the developmental and
sequential nature of attitudes toward police officers
and instructors. The study has also provided find-
ings with important implications for prevention
programming, policy makers and agencies con-
cerned with improving the public image of the po-
lice and police functions.
Given the possibility that program outcomes are
related to attitudes toward program instructors [1,
2], the more positive evaluation of police instruc-
tors by students in this study suggests that programs
delivered by police officers are more likely to have
a positive impact. Consequently, we suggest that
police officers may be appropriate deliverers of

prevention programs for the majority of adoles-
cents. The use of police officers as instructors of
prevention programs has the potential of not only
helping improve the effectiveness of prevention
programs but would also help create and sustain
a more positive image of the police or at least abate
the negative image held by adolescents.
The positive image of the police developed
among students may create a situation where the
students could relate cordially to the police, report
crime voluntarily and cooperate in curbing crime in
schools. With schools being a microcosm of the
wider community, it is expected that the cordial
relationship developed between the police and stu-
dents in schools would be transferred to the com-
munity. This might engender more positive
community engagement and meaningful police­
community partnerships toward effective and effi-
cient policing.
This is particularly important considering that
community policing has become a dominant ap-
proach to policing in the United States of America
in recent years. With effective community policing
centering on meaningful police­public cooperation
and the observation that adolescents form a dispro-
portionately large segment of the population the
police encounter in their duties [16], the successful
maintenance of law and order, especially commu-
nity policing will require, among others, promoting
trust and positive image of the police among ado-
lescents. Against this backdrop and the findings
from the study, it will not be out of place to argue
for a mechanism such as the D.A.R.E. delivery
system that creates an opportunity for adolescents
to encounter the police in a more friendly and sup-
portive context.
However, the differential evaluation of police
instructors among students indicates that the effec-
tiveness of prevention programs delivered by
police instructors might not be equal for all stu-
dents. For instance, prevention programs delivered
by police instructors might be more effective for
students not involved in `illegal' activities than for
students involved in some form of `illegal' activ-
ity. In fact any prevention program may not
have credibility for this group of students who
may warrant other, more intensive interventions.
While these characteristics pertain to a smaller
proportion of adolescents, it is proposed that deci-
sions concerning the use of police officers as
instructors of prevention programs must take into
consideration students' unique characteristics and
social context.
Future research
The factors influencing students' attitudes toward
instructors of prevention programs are complex. A
complete understanding of students' attitudes to-
ward police instructors, therefore, would require
further studies. First, it is suggested that this study
be replicated in other contexts with efforts made in
addressing the limitations highlighted above. Par-
ticularly, researchers replicating this study should
measure students' contacts with the police both
within and outside the school as well as the nature,
frequency and intensity of such contacts.
Researchers designing future studies should also
include a diverse array of instructors of school-
based substance abuse prevention programs includ-
ing, but not limited to, police officers, peer groups,
teachers and counselors. They should also consider
a broader age range of students and consider the
developmental changes in attitudes overtime.
It is possible that adolescents' attitudes toward
police instructors might differ across geographic
areas. To address these possible differences, it is
suggested that future research considers regional
analysis of students' attitudes toward police instruc-
tors. Researchers designing such study should de-
termine whether students' attitudes toward police
instructors differ across cities/areas and the possible
cause for any observed difference. The importance
of such study is illuminated by the view from this
study that context matters in understanding atti-
tudes toward police instructors.
