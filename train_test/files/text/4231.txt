Introduction
Drawing ability begins at a young age and develops through
adulthood. Toddlers enjoy scribbling with different colors
while children begin to draw more realistic drawings around
age 4. This process continues to evolve into and beyond ado-
lescence (Lowenfeld & Brittain, 1987). Age is an important
factor in drawing as holding a pencil and drawing precisely
requires the finger muscles and general motor control to be
sufficiently developed. This is said to happen around the age
of 5 years (Ouz, 2010).
Lowenfeld and Brittain (1987) present a comprehensive
account of drawing, outlining six stages of artistic develop-
ment in children, referring to concepts such as age appropri-
ateness and reflection. Stages are referenced against the
child's age, or expected stage of development. These begin
with the scribbling stage (demonstrated by children aged 2 to
4 years), followed by the preschematic stage (age 4 to 7)
where children are thought to show their first attempts at rep-
resentational drawings (e.g., a drawing of a person with a
circular head and "stick" legs), then the schematic stage (age
7 to 9) where they demonstrate concepts and are much more
confident in their drawings as they resemble objects more
than before. Children between 9 and 11 years are "gang age,"
also referred to as the preadolescent crisis, and their draw-
ings reflect how things actually look and are expressed in
detail, they also become critical of their drawings at this
stage. Between 11 and 13 years, children reach the age of
reasoning. During this stage, Lowenfeld and Brittain identify
that children's art becomes less of a "spontaneous process."
The final stages of this model (which approximately span the
years of puberty, around ages 12 to 17 years) involve more
detail, precision, and perspective. The pseudo-naturalistic
stage involves the depiction of perspective, 3D objects, shad-
ing, and attempts to demonstrate motion. The final stage of
the model is the adolescent art stage demonstrated by adoles-
cents aged 14 to 17 years of age, and is said to refer to the
crisis of adolescence. Drawings at this stage can span a num-
ber of styles. It is at this stage that natural development is
said to stop unless a conscious decision is made to continue
drawing (Lowenfeld & Brittain, 1987). Based on Lowenfeld
and Brittain's model, we would expect little difference
between the drawings of adolescents and adults. For exam-
ple, Lowenfeld and Brittain state that once individuals are in
the final adolescent art stage, skill will only improve if the
individual has both the opportunity, and desire, to do this. In
addition, Nicholls and Kennedy (1992) examined cube
drawing in children and adults and found that there was no

Monochrome Males and Colorful Females:
Do Gender and Age Influence the Color
and Content of Drawings?
Lynn Wright1 and Fiona Black1
Abstract
Influences of educational level and gender were examined through free drawings. A total of 216 participants were recruited
ranging from nursery school to university students. Using an adaptation of Turgeon's methodology, participants were given
a standardized set of colored pens and asked to draw a picture. Pictures were analyzed for the area of the page covered,
colors used, number of colors used, and content. Overall, females covered more of the page, and used more colors than
males. Females drew significantly more sky, flowers/trees and buildings (in most cases houses), and males drew more people
and vehicles. In relation to educational level, nursery children used fewer colors than the other groups and secondary school
children used more colors than primary school children. It was concluded that gender differences in content, and color, of
drawings exist and these differences remain stable into adulthood. Results are discussed in terms of social and evolutionary
theory.

difference between the drawings of 14- and 15-year-old indi-
viduals and adults. They explained that more sophisticated
geometry knowledge in the older children allowed them to
produce similar cubes to the adults. Therefore, knowledge of
angles, perspective, and scale in adolescents and adults might
help explain why their drawings would be expected to be
similar.
Lowenfeld and Brittain's stages focus on the process of
drawing and reflection of the art work, rather than the con-
tent and color of the drawings. For example, if a drawing is
of a dog then the focus would be on the age appropriateness
of the drawing. Analyses may be carried out in a number of
additional ways to provide us with further rich information
regarding the artists and their drawings. One important ele-
ment that Lowenfeld and Brittain did not focus on was gen-
der differences. Indeed, it is the case that very little research
examines color and pictorial content beyond the elementary
years.
Several researchers have reported differences relating to
content and color of drawings by male and female children.
Iijima, Arisaka, Minamoto, and Arais (2001) reported that
males aged 5 to 6 years used fewer colors in their drawings
than females, and used more grays and blues, while females
preferred pink and flesh colors. Milne and Greenway (1999)
reported that older male children (between 10 and 14 years)
used fewer colors compared with younger males (under 10
years); however, older and younger females used an equal
number of colors. They suggested that pubertal males use
fewer colors due to the inhibition of emotional responses at
this time. Ellis and Ficek (2001) found that male college stu-
dents preferred to use cold colors such as blue and green,
while females preferred warm colors such as red and yellow.
There is an argument that sex differences in color preference
may be related to the evolutionary division of labor with
females evolving to identify yellow fruit, red leaves, and red
and purple berries in their role of gatherer (Hurlbert & Ling,
2007). In relation to these findings, He et al. (2011) reported
that males preferred blue and green, whereas females pre-
ferred pink, purple, and white. They also relate their findings
to the hunter-gatherer theory stating that men, as hunters,
prefer blue and green, which are considered calm colors and
are related to the natural environment such as the blue sky.
Women, as gatherers, prefer pink, purple, and white, which
are said to be warm and peaceful colors.
Turgeon (2008) examined drawings by elementary school
children and found that boys used more cold colors (e.g.,
black and gray), while girls used more pink, purple, and yel-
low in their drawings. Previous research has demonstrated
that younger children prefer warm colors but as they get
older preference shifts to cooler colors. A common method
of investigating color preference is presenting pairs of colors
to participants and asking for their preference. When using
this method, Child, Hansen, and Hornbeck (1968) reported
that children between the ages of 6 to 18 years preferred
cooler colors. Although most research on color preference
has been carried out with children, several studies have
examined color preference in adults. Ellis and Ficek's (2001)
work examined color preference in college students while
Silver and Ferrante (1995) reported that retired male and
females' favorite color was blue. However, when carrying
out research with older adults additional factors have to be
addressed such as quality of eye sight and potential color
perception difficulties. Dittmar (2001) asked adults ranging
from 19 to 90 years to choose their preferred and least pre-
ferred color. Older and younger groups preferred blue but
older participants preferred green over red, and younger par-
ticipants preferred red over green. Dittmar suggested that
changes in color preference could be explained by social
influence; older participants spend more time gardening or
on walks outside that may influence their preference for the
color green. Finally, Silver et al. (1988) examined color pref-
erence among college students and concurred that males
chose blue as their favorite color more than females did. The
content of children's drawings has also been investigated.
Willats (2005) stated that young children draw familiar
objects while older children draw what they see. Iijima et al.
(2001) found that boys preferred to draw mobile and mechan-
ical objects such as cars and rockets, while girls preferred to
draw people and flowers. Turgeon (2008) found that females
preferred to draw flowers, sky, and animals, while boys pre-
ferred to draw people. All of the previous studies examined
the content of drawings by children who were under 9 years
of age, and thus it is relatively unknown whether the content
of adolescent's and young adult's drawings would continue
to demonstrate similar sex differences. Young female chil-
dren have been reported to use more of the page than males
when asked to draw a picture (Iijima et al., 2001; Turgeon,
2008). Female's drawings are often larger but much of the
area is taken up by details such as grass and sky that expand
to cover the whole page. To date, no study has examined the
content of adults' free drawings outside of a clinical setting.
Aside from the evolutionary derived hypotheses (e.g.,
Hurlbert & Ling, 2007), sex differences can be explained
through biological and social theories. Biological theory
hypothesizes that gender differences are present from birth
and are influenced by prenatal androgens such as testoster-
one (Lutchmaya, Baron-Cohen, Raggatt, Knickmeyer, &
Manning, 2004) while social theory indicates that we learn
gender roles through observing others, and via sex role
socialization through education and the media (Katz &
Ksansnak, 1994). Turgeon (2008) proposed that sex differ-
ences across a range of ages could signify that drawing has a
biological basis due to prenatal androgen exposure. This is
supported by the work of Iijima et al. (2001) who reported
that females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH;
caused by exposure to higher levels of prenatal androgens)
drew more masculine pictures.
Koller (2008) discussed color preference in the context of
social theory. Products marketed at women were examined
and shown to consist of warm colors and soft shapes, whereas
Wright and Black 3
products marketed at men consisted of colder colors and
angular shapes.
Cherney, Seiwert, Dickey, and Flichtbeil (2006) state that
children's drawings can be influenced by their education,
culture, and society. They state that cultural and society
influences can be expressed in drawings through the type of
clothing depicted in drawings of people. Girls were also
more likely to add detail to drawings that were seen to be
relatively stereotypical, such as jewelry, specific hair styles,
and details such as fingernails on hands. La Vooy et al. (2001)
examined the drawings of Japanese and American children
for the number of smiles included, and found that American
children were more likely to include smiles in their draw-
ings. La Vooy et al. and Cherney et al. (2006) looked at the
heights of humans depicted in drawings and found that
female children tended to draw larger human figures. Both
studies concluded that the depiction of larger human figures
could relate to increased self-esteem and the individual's
worth in their culture.
A question remains as to whether gender differences in
free drawing content and color preference continue to be evi-
dent throughout adolescence and into adulthood. Most stud-
ies examining color use and content in drawing involve
relatively young children, or studies that do involve adults
often examine neuropsychological measures such as clock
drawing (e.g., Hubbard et al., 2008), figure drawing (e.g.,
Guez, Lev-Wiesel, Valetsky, Sztul, & Pener, 2010), or evalu-
ate changes in the ability to draw the human figure across the
life span (e.g., Ericsson, Winblad, & Nilsson, 2001).
To investigate effects of educational level (age) and gen-
der, we examined drawings of nursery school, primary
school, and secondary school pupils (all in their final year of
study) along with University students (in their penultimate
year of study). Each person was asked to complete a free
drawing and had the choice of a standard set of 10 colored
pens. Drawings were analyzed for the area of page covered,
content (using an adaptation of categories defined by
Turgeon, 2008), number of colors used, and actual colors
used. The content of nursery children's drawings was not
examined due to the lack of pictorial content. Based on pre-
vious findings it was predicted that females would cover a
larger area of the page, females would use more colors in
their drawings, males and females would use different colors
in their drawings and would draw different types of pictures.
It was also predicted that educational level (age) would affect
drawing content and that the number of colors used and the
actual colors used would change with age, particularly
around puberty.
Method
Participants
A total of 216 participants took part in the study: 47 nursery
children (22 males and 25 females) aged 3 to 4 years,
47 primary seven children (18 males and 29 females) aged
10 to 11 years, 42 final year secondary school pupils (21
males and 21 females) aged 16 to 17 years, and 80 University
students (24 males and 56 females, ranging from 20 to
51 years--mean age 21 years). This research was carried out
in Scotland, UK.
Materials
A standard set of 10 different colored felt tip pens were given
to participants (black, gray, blue, pink, red, yellow, orange,
brown, green, and purple) along with a blank sheet of
A4 paper. The area of the page was assessed using a Perspex
grid of 200 rectangles measuring 2 × 1.45 cm. Details of each
participant's gender, age, and education group were recorded.
Permission and full ethical clearance was given to carry out
this research in each educational establishment.
Procedure
In the nursery school condition, children were given a piece
of A4 paper and the standard set of 10 colored pens and were
asked to draw a picture. Due to the informal nature, partici-
pants were not given a time limit but were still timed; how-
ever, no child took more than 10 min to complete their
drawing. In the primary school, secondary school and uni-
versity condition participants were given an A4 sheet of
paper, the standard set of 10 colored pens and were given 10
min to draw a picture. After 10 min, drawings were collected
for analysis. All the data were coded by the experimenters
(area of the page used, colors used [total number and indi-
vidual colors] and picture content). A standardized checklist
was used to record this information.
Results
Number of Colors Used
Figure 1 shows that females in every educational group used
more colors, on average, than their male counterparts.
A 2 (gender) × 4 (education level) between subjects
ANOVA was carried out to investigate the number of colors
used. There was a significant main effect of gender,
F(1, 208) = 59.3, p < .001, partial 2 = .2, and observed
power = 1, with females using significantly more colors
(average of eight colors) in their drawings than males (aver-
age of five colors). There was a significant main effect of
education level, F(3, 208) = 24.5, p < .001, partial 2 = .3,
and observed power = 1. The interaction between gender and
education level was not significant F < 1.
Bonferroni t-tests were carried out to investigate the dif-
ferences between levels of education for the number of col-
ors used. Nursery children used significantly fewer colors
than the other educational levels (primary school children,
secondary school children, and university students; p < .001
4 SAGE Open
for all). Primary school children used fewer colors (on aver-
age) than secondary school children (p = .008), but there was
no significant difference in the number of colors used
between primary school children and university students or
between secondary school children and university students.
Figure 2 shows that the number of colors used by males
and females across each educational level followed the same
pattern but females used more colors at each stage.
Additional independent samples t-tests were carried out
to examine whether females used more colors than males at
each educational level. Female nursery school children used
significantly more colors than males, t(45) = -2.7, p < .001,
r = .4, as did female primary school children, t(45) = -5.1,
p < .001, r = .6, female secondary school children, t(40) =
-3.8, p < .001, r = .5, and female university students, t(78) =
-5.0, p < .001, r = .5.
Area of Page Covered
Figure 3 indicates that females in every educational group
covered a larger area of the page, on average, than males.
A 2 (gender) × 4 (education level) between-subjects
ANOVA was carried out to investigate the area of the page
covered. There was a significant main effect of gender,
F(1, 208) = 8.06, p = .005, partial 2 = .03, observed power = .8,
with females covering more area. There was no significant
effect of education level (p = .09) and no significant interac-
tion between gender and education level (p = .81)
Individual Color Usage
2 analyses were carried out to investigate the individual
color usage of participants (by gender and by educational
level). Females' drawings were more likely to contain every
color except for black than males'. That is, a higher propor-
tion of females used pink, purple, blue, green, red, yellow,
gray, orange, and brown in their drawings than males.

and females across four levels of education.

Interestingly, but perhaps not surprisingly, the colors used
least by males were pink (32.2%) and purple (29.4%). The
findings are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
Table 2 shows that there was a significant difference in
the colors used in drawings across education level groups for
all colors except pink and purple. However, closer inspection
of Table 2 shows that the differences might be influenced by
the nursery group who have lower representations of the col-
ors compared with the other three groups.
We therefore removed the nursery group from the 2 anal-
ysis and found that only gray and blue showed a significant
difference in appearance in drawings across primary school,
secondary school, and university groups (gray: 2 = 14.3,
p = .001, crv = .3, and blue: 2 = 10.4, p = .006, crv = .3).
More secondary school students used blue in their pictures
than the other groups while fewer primary school pupils used
gray in their drawings.
Picture Content
2 analyses were carried out to investigate the content of par-
ticipant's drawings (by gender and by educational level). It
was found that males, irrespective of age, drew more people
(2 = 7.2, p = .007, crv = .2) and vehicles (2 = 18.6, p < .001,
crv = .3), and females drew more flowers/trees (2 = 4.7,
p = .03, crv = .2), sky (2 = 12.2, p < .001, crv = .3), and
buildings (houses; 2 = 8.5, p = .003, crv = .2).
When examining the educational level, it was found that,
overall, more primary and secondary school children drew
flowers/trees (2 = 24.1, p < .001, crv = .4), sports (2 = 25.6,
p < .001, crv = .4), houses (2 = 22.5, p < .001, crv = .4) and
wrote more words on their pictures (2 = 21.0, p < .001, crv
= .4) than university students. However, on further analysis,
it was found that each of these effects was driven by the
female participants. Female primary and secondary school
children, in fact, drew more flowers/trees (p < .001), sports
(p < .001), houses (p < .001), and words (p < .001) in their
pictures than female university students. When the content of
male drawings was examined across each educational group
there were no differences (p > .05 for all categories).
The content of drawings by primary school children and
secondary school children appeared to be quite similar.
Therefore, we looked at this selection of data and found that
only the number of drawings of people were significantly
different (2 = 3.9, p = .049, crv = .2) with 55% of secondary
school children drawing people compared with 34% of pri-
mary school children.
The most popular drawings among female primary school
children and secondary school children were houses and
flowers/trees while for female university students it was the
sky and houses. The most popular drawing content among
primary school, secondary school, and university males was
people. Examples of drawings from each gender and age
group can be seen in Figure 4.
Discussion
In the current study we examined whether sex differences in
drawing production were evident beyond childhood and
adolescence.
It was hypothesized that gender and age would influence
the content, color, and size of drawings. Significant differ-
ences were reported for the area of the page that drawings
covered, with females using more space than males (irre-
spective of age), which replicates the findings of Turgeon
(2008). Analyses of drawings also revealed significant dif-
ferences between males and females in the number of differ-
ent colors used, with females using more colors overall in
their drawings than males. We examined gender differences
in the number of colors used in the individual educational
groups and found that females used significantly more colors
in each group. This finding supports Turgeon (2008) and
Iijima et al. (2001) who found that young females (age 6 and
under) used more colors than males. Nursery school children
(both genders) used fewer colors in their drawings than the
other groups and, interestingly, secondary school children
(males and females) used the most colors. This could be
attributed to drawings at this stage being more realistic and
advanced thus requiring more colors. Male secondary school
students in our sample used an average of seven colors in
their drawings while primary school children used an aver-
age of five colors. This finding supports Milne and
Greenway's (1999) research suggesting that male color
usage fluctuates in relation to emotional response prior to
puberty. Our secondary school students were aged 16 or
17 years and arguably these students were at the end of
puberty, whereas the primary school students (aged 11 or 12
years) were at the onset of puberty, which may explain their
lower color use.
Milne and Greenway suggested that female emotional
expression tends to remain relatively consistent and thus the
number of colors used by females across the different age
groups would be similar. In our sample, the average number

of colors used by female primary, secondary, and university
students ranged between 8 and 9 (out of a possible 10).
Turgeon (2008) found that sex differences in color use were
only found in older children, but examining our sample for
sex differences in the number of colors used, we found this
difference evident even in the youngest group.
We reported nine significant associations between gender
and individual colors used with females using every color
more except for black. In terms of educational level there
were relatively few differences in color usage. Overall, nurs-
ery school children used less of each color than the other
three groups but interestingly they used as much pink and
purple in their drawings. This is contrary to Turgeon's find-
ings who reported that students in the second and third grade
used significantly more pinks and purples than first grade
and kindergarten students. One reason that might have influ-
enced this difference could be the number of colors available
to our sample (10) compared with Turgeon's (24). Turgeon
refers to "pinks" and "purples" suggesting that there were
more than one shade of pink and purple available to partici-
pants. Moreover, by increasing the numbers of pens avail-
able in Turgeon's study, there would be an increased
likelihood of the more sophisticated artists--that is, the older
children--using more shades of each color to define and
determine objects in their pictures, thus influencing the age
difference in color usage.
Ellis and Ficek (2001) reported that male college students
preferred to use cold colors such as blue and green, while
females preferred warm colors such as red and yellow. In our
sample, over three quarters of females used blue and green
compared with just over half of males. In fact, warm colors
such as red and yellow were used just as much by males as
cold colors. In our sample, there is no clear pattern of males
preferring cold colors and females preferring warm colors.
Ellis and Ficek measured color preference by means of ask-
ing participants what their favorite color was while we
looked at color usage in drawings and this may have influ-
enced findings. We propose that the use of color is influenced
by the content of the drawing, especially in older groups. It is
difficult to make assumptions that colors included in draw-
ings are preferred colors as opposed to functional colors.
Embellishing drawings could be one method of identifying
color preference. For example, if a person draws a picture of
a red car, the car color could indicate color preference.
In terms of picture content, males drew more people and
vehicles while females drew more trees/flowers, sky, and
houses. The finding that males drew more people supports
Turgeon (2008) but fails to support Iijima et al. (2001) who
reported that girls were more likely to draw people. Turgeon
explained her findings by stating that there was a tendency
for the older boys to draw sporting events with people in
them. In our sample, 34 males included people in their draw-
ings; however, only 10 of these contained sporting events
with people in them. The most common drawing containing
people by males was some form of superhero or fireman/
soldier. This is perhaps influenced by exposure to television,
films and computer games as well as sex role socialization.
Recently, there has been an influx of superhero movies, and
associated memorabilia (e.g., Iron man, X men, and
Spiderman to name a few) that are predominantly aimed at a
young male audience, and this perhaps influenced male
drawings in our sample. In support of this, Cherney and
London (2006) reported that males watched more masculine
television programs and watched television for longer than
females. We found that there was no difference in the content
of male drawings from primary school through to university
students. Female participants' drawing content was similar
across the age ranges; however, female primary and second-
ary school pupils drew more houses, flowers and trees, and
sport than female university students. What is interesting,
however, is that one of the most common drawings in each
female age group was a house indicating that there are simi-
larities across each age group.
Previous research examined gender differences in relation
to evolutionary, biological, and social theory. Many research-
ers have found sex differences in drawings from an early age
and this lends support to biological theory. Our youngest par-
ticipants were 3 years of age, but sex differences were still
Wright and Black 7
evident. Arguably, this lends support to a biological argu-
ment. Drawings produced by nursery children also support
social theory as the largest difference between individual
color use by males and females was the inclusion of pink and
purple in drawings. Drawings by nursery children were
mainly scribbles and this shows evidence of color preference
rather than content. Male color usage supports social and
evolutionary theory with more males using blue and green in
their drawings. The colors used least by males were pink and
purple, which supports sex role socialization. It is difficult to
draw conclusions regarding evolutionary theory. Although
there is evidence that drawings have evolved in terms of their
Figure 4. Examples of drawings from educational and gender groups.

sophistication, we cannot conclude that females in the sam-
ple, irrespective of age, preferred colors such as yellow, pur-
ple, and red as they used most of the available colors more
than males.
If Lowenfeld and Brittain's stage theory of drawing is to
be supported, we would expect little difference between sec-
ondary school pupil's drawings and university student's
drawings as natural development is said to stop around the
age of 17 years. In the current sample, most similarities in
drawings occurred between secondary school pupils and
university students. There was no difference between the
numbers of colors used in the drawings nor was there any
difference in the area that their drawings covered. Thus,
there seems to be some support for the contention that sec-
ondary school students produce similar drawings to univer-
sity students.
One criticism of the current study is that we only provided
a standard set of 10 colors, while other studies (e.g., Turgeon,
2008) provided more colors. An increased number of avail-
able colors would allow further creativity in drawings. We
could also have asked participants to name their favorite
color to examine preference differences. In addition, our
sample consisted of students who were in their final year of
study at nursery, primary, and secondary school and penulti-
mate year of study at university. Although we found differ-
ences in the drawings of our current participants, examination
of participants who were closer in age to each other, particu-
larly those about to enter, going through, or having just gone
through puberty would be extremely interesting (e.g., partici-
pants aged 10 through to 15 years). Future studies will mea-
sure digit ratio as an indicator of prenatal testosterone
exposure. Many of our university students were only 2 or
3 years older than the secondary school students, but there
was a relatively large difference between the primary school
children (aged 10 or 11 years) compared with the secondary
school children (aged 16 or 17 years) and the nursery school
children (aged 4 or 5 years). In the current study, we looked
at a limited sample of ages but it would be interesting to
recruit a wider range of participants to examine if these pat-
terns continue.
In summary, these results support sex differences in color
use in free drawings irrespective of age, and indicate that
even after puberty and into adulthood, strong sex differences
exist in color use and drawing content. At every educational
stage, females used more colors in their drawings than males,
and secondary school and university students used more col-
ors than the younger groups. Milne and Greenway state that
as males approach puberty, their emotional responses are
inhibited, and this is reflected in the reduced number of col-
ors in their drawings; the current findings lend support to this
work. We also found that there is no difference in the content
of drawings between male primary school, secondary school,
and university students, so perhaps as previously mentioned,
color reflects the developmental differences in males, rather
than content. The content of female participants' drawings
differed slightly, but many contained very detailed, and col-
orful, drawings of houses, which again suggests that drawing
content is similar in adulthood. Therefore, gender differences
in drawing across a number of age groups show evidence of
sex role socialization but also lend some support for evolu-
tionary and biological theory. Future work will allow us to
address these theories further.
