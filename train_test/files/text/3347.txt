Introduction
In recent decades, several scholars have called for more sus-
tained scholarly attention to the roles of public support (and
public opinion more generally) for social movements
(Burstein, 1998; Giugni, 1998; McCright & Dunlap, 2015;
Stern, Dietz, Abel, Guagnano, & Kalof, 1999). These calls
seem motivated by two developments in the field. One is our
increasing recognition that the social context in which move-
ments operate facilitates or inhibits their emergence, mobili-
zation, and outcomes. Indeed, the mass media and public
opinion provide support or opposition for a movement, thus
opening or closing windows of opportunity for action (e.g.,
Beaford, Gongaware, & Valadez, 2000; Neidhardht & Rucht,
1991). Another is our increasing recognition that we need to
better understand those factors that influence identification
with and participation in movements (e.g., Klandermans,
2000; McCright & Dunlap, 2008a; Zald, 2000a, 2000b).
Here, public opinion signifies the potential pools of citizens
who may be converted from adherents into activists in move-
ments--or from unsympathetic to them into activists against
them (e.g., Hunt, Benford, & Snow, 1994; Stern et al., 1999).
One reason that social movement scholars have been slow
to investigate the roles of public support for social movements
is the paucity of measurement instruments, empirical data, and
analytical techniques suitable for facilitating such research. In
recent years, McCright and Dunlap (2008a, 2015; Dunlap &
McCright, 2008) have begun to remedy this by developing
and validating a measure of social movement identity for the
environmental movement. They argue that a generic, revised
version of this measure may be efficacious for examining
identification with a broad array of movements, especially
when it is embedded within a nationally representative survey.
Such a revised measure would facilitate investigation of over-
lapping support for (or opposition to) multiple movements,
allowing further contributions to cross-movement research
(e.g., Minkoff, 1997; Van Dyke, 2003).
In this study, we showcase a generalized version of the
social movement identity measure first presented by Dunlap
and McCright (2008). Our social movement identity instru-
ment may be useful for scholars interested in examining pub-
lic support as a movement resource or as an indicator of
potential activists or opponents. We demonstrate the efficacy
of our instrument by investigating identification with 20
major U.S. social movements within a diverse sample of the
American public. Following the lead of McCright and
Dunlap (2008b), we first examine the clustering of different

A Social Movement Identity Instrument
for Integrating Survey Methods Into
Social Movements Research
Summer Allen1, Aaron M. McCright1, and Thomas Dietz1
Abstract
Given increasing scholarly recognition of the need to better understand the factors that influence identification with
or participation in social movements, we build upon recent work that integrates public opinion methods and analytical
techniques into social movements research. Specifically, we revise an existing measure of environmental movement identity
into a general measure of identification with a broad range of movements. Our analyses show that this new instrument
captures meaningful variation across levels of identification with 20 major U.S. social movements and also helps distinguish
among three movement identity clusters that largely align with key movement families. Furthermore, we provide strong
evidence that our instrument has construct validity, as selected predictors explain variation in the three movement identity
clusters in ways expected by previous research. We close by proposing an agenda for future research that helps advance our
understanding of public support for or engagement with social movements.

social movement identities. We also examine the demo-
graphic, social, and political bases of these social movement
identities. Influenced by work on values (e.g., Gecas, 2000;
Stern et al., 1999) and morals (e.g., Jasper, 1997)--as well as
related work on emotions (e.g., Jasper, 2011)--in social
movements scholarship, we further examine how values ori-
entations and moral intuitions influence social movement
identities.
In the next section, we briefly review the relevant scholar-
ship by McCright and Dunlap (2008a, 2015; Dunlap &
McCright, 2008), who introduce and validate the social
movement identity measure that we extend here. As our con-
tribution primarily focuses on instrumentation and analytical
techniques, we abstain from a wider theoretical or concep-
tual discussion about identity and social movements, which
Dunlap and McCright (2008) and McCright and Dunlap
(2015) review. In subsequent sections, we describe our study
participants, the social movement identity instrument, and
the other measures used in our study. After discussing our
results, we sketch a future research agenda for using this
social movement identity instrument to improve our under-
standing of understudied rank-and-file movement members,
sympathetic adherents, and unsympathetic opponents in the
general public.
Developing a Measure of Social
Movement Identity
Despite the increased attention to identity in the social move-
ments literature in recent decades (e.g., Hunt & Benford,
2004; Johnston & Klandermans, 1995; Laraña, Johnston, &
Gusfield, 1994; Stryker, Owens, & White, 2000), the concept
remains rather ambiguous (see, for example, Jasper, 1997, p.
85; Snow & McAdam, 2000, p. 41). To promote conceptual
clarity and empirical precision, Dunlap and McCright (2008)
examine selected frameworks that enumerate key dimen-
sions of identity (e.g., Gamson, 1991; Hunt et al., 1994;
Jasper, 1997; Johnston, Laraña, & Gusfield, 1994). They are
persuaded by the logic and empirical utility of Jasper's
(1997) typology of personal, collective, and movement iden-
tities and Hunt et al.'s (1994) typology of protagonist, audi-
ence, and antagonist identity fields. Briefly, Dunlap and
McCright (2008) argue that a social movement identity mea-
sure that taps movement identity as conceptualized by Jasper
(1997) and also captures the different identity fields concep-
tualized by Hunt et al. (1994) will facilitate the type of
empirical research on public support and opposition to social
movements that other scholars have been calling for (e.g.,
Burstein, 1998; Giugni, 1998; Stern et al., 1999).
Using survey data from a nationally representative Gallup
Poll in 2000, Dunlap and McCright (2008) introduce and
validate a measure of environmental movement identity.
They use responses to the survey item--"Thinking specifi-
cally about the environmental movement, do you think of
yourself as: an active participant in the environmental
movement; sympathetic towards the movement, but not
active; neutral; or unsympathetic towards the environmental
movement?"--to differentiate across the following environ-
mental movement identities: unsympathetic, neutral, sympa-
thetic but not active, and active participant. Dunlap and
McCright (2008) find this single-item measure of environ-
mental movement identity to be moderately associated with
membership in environmental movement organizations,
evaluations of the environmental movement, and pro-envi-
ronmental behaviors.
McCright and Dunlap (2008a) extend the Dunlap and
McCright (2008) study while analyzing 6 years of Gallup
data from 2000 to 2006. They investigate how this single-
item indicator of environmental movement identity is associ-
ated with key characteristics of environmental problem
belief systems within the U.S. public, building upon earlier
scholarship on the movement-related belief systems of orga-
nizational leaders. Briefly, McCright and Dunlap (2008a)
find that "the environmental problem belief systems of self-
identified active participants in the environmental movement
exhibit greater consistency, greater consensus, and less posi-
tion extremity than do those of individuals unsympathetic to
the environmental movement" (p. 651).
Most recently, analyzing data from a March 2000 Gallup
Poll, McCright and Dunlap (2015) compare the relative per-
formance of two measures of environmental movement iden-
tity: a variant of Pichardo Almanzar, Sullivan-Catlin, and
Deane's (1998) "self-identified environmentalist" and
Dunlap and McCright's (2008) "environmental movement
identity." They find that Dunlap and McCright's (2008) envi-
ronmental movement identity indicator more strongly pre-
dicts environmental organization membership and affect
toward the environmental movement than does Pichardo
Almanzar et al.'s (1998) self-identified environmentalist
indicator, while the latter more strongly predicts self-reported
pro-environmental behaviors than does the former. They
argue that a slightly revised version of Dunlap and McCright's
(2008) self-reported indicator of social movement identity
may help scholars investigate identification and engagement
with a broad array of social movements via surveys of nation-
ally representative samples of the public--achieving wide
generalizability and further embedding public opinion schol-
arship into social movement research.
In this study, we revise the Dunlap and McCright (2008,
p. 413) measure in two ways they suggest. First, we include
an "active opponent" response category to mirror the "active
participant" category. This will allow us to capture those
individuals who are actively opposing--not just unsympa-
thetic toward--a movement. Second, we revise the question
stem and response categories so they can apply to any move-
ment and not just the environmental movement. We demon-
strate the efficacy of this revised social movement identity
instrument by investigating identification with 20 major U.S.
social movements within a diverse sample of the American
public.

The Study
Participants and Procedures
We tested our social movement identity instrument via an
online survey administered to a modestly sized U.S. conve-
nience sample. Briefly, we administered our survey via
SurveyMonkey to participants we recruited via Amazon
Mechanical Turk (AMT), a crowdsourcing website where
"requesters" solicit "workers" to perform "human intelli-
gence tasks" (HITs) for pay. AMT has emerged as a practical
way for recruiting a large number of participants from a rea-
sonably wide cross-section of the general public either for
conducting online experiments (e.g., Clements, McCright,
Dietz, & Marquart-Pyatt, 2015) or for designing and testing
new measurement instruments (e.g., Allen, Dietz, &
McCright, 2015) across the social sciences (e.g., Goodman,
Cryder, & Cheema, 2013; Levay, Freese, & Druckman,
2016; Paolacci & Chandler, 2014; Stewart et al., 2015;
Weinberg, Freese, & McElhattan, 2014). To solicit a broad
cross-section of research participants and minimize self-
selection by AMT workers highly engaged with different
social movements, we advertised a HIT titled "YourAttitudes
About Important Social Issues in the US." We limited par-
ticipation to adults residing in the United States.
Our survey was completed by 542 U.S. residents on May
23, 2015. Respondents earned US$1.00 for completing the sur-
vey, which took slightly less than 8 min on average. Compared
with a representative sample of the U.S. general public, our
AMT convenience sample is younger, more highly educated,
more liberal, and less religious (see Table 1). In addition to our
social movement identity instrument, the survey included typi-
cal questions about respondents' demographic, social, and
political characteristics as well as questions we used to measure
their values orientations and moral intuitions.
Measures in the Study
Near the end of the survey, respondents answered the follow-
ing question:
Many social movements in our nation try to influence
government policy, business practices, and/or social and cultural
norms. Below is a list of 20 US social movements that have been
active in recent decades. Please indicate how, if at all, you
identify with each social movement.1
Their response categories (with coding) were as follows:
·
· I'm an active opponent of this movement (1);
·
· I'm unsympathetic toward the movement, but I don't
actively oppose it (2);
·
· I'm neutral toward this movement (3);
·
· I'm sympathetic toward the movement, but I'm not
active in it (4); and
·
· I'm an active participant in this movement (5).
The order of these 20 movements was randomized so that
respondents saw the items in different orders. Nonresponse
across these 20 items was rather minimal; most items had
only one or two cases with a missing value, and no item had
more than five cases with missing values. To maintain sam-
ple size when creating our scales, we assigned missing val-
ues to the median category for that specific item.
The results of exploratory factor analysis (described in the
"Analytical Techniques" section) informed our creation of
three social movement identity scales, which we formed by
averaging respondent's answers to similar items. One mea-
sure, progressive movement identity (Cronbach's  = .83),
taps identification with the rights-based and other progres-
sive social movements: animal rights, antinuclear, civil
rights, environmental, gay and lesbian rights, gun control,
labor, peace, pro-choice, and women's rights movements.
Another measure, traditional and Christian movement iden-
tity ( = .81), captures identification with general conserva-
tive movements and the Christian Right: anti-immigration,
antipornography, Christian Right, pro-life, and Tea Party
movements. A final measure, masculinist and libertarian
movement identity ( = .68), taps identification with conser-
vative masculinity and property rights movements: libertar-
ian, men's rights, militia, Promise Keepers, and property
rights movements.
We measured respondents' values orientations using the
Schwartz approach (Dietz, 2015; Schwartz & Bilsky, 1987),
as modified by Stern, Dietz, and Guagnano (1998); Steg and
de Groot (2012); and Dietz (2015). Respondents indicated

the importance (from "not at all important" = 1 to "of
supreme importance" = 7) of several brief value statements
as a guiding principle in their lives. The order of these items
was randomized. The full list of value statements appears in
Table SM1 in the Supplementary Materials. Informed by the
results of exploratory factor analysis, we created four values
orientations scales by averaging respondents' answers to
similar items: openness to change ( = .68), traditionalism
( = .66), self-interest ( = .82), and humanistic altruism
( = .79).
We measured respondents' moral intuitions using the
Moral Foundations Questionnaire (Graham, Haidt, & Nosek,
2009), which consists of two related questions assessing the
kinds of moral intuitions people use when making decisions
about right and wrong. Respondents indicated the relevance
(from "not at all relevant" = 1 to "extremely relevant" = 6) of
several brief moral considerations when deciding whether
something is right or wrong, and they expressed their judg-
ment (from "strongly disagree" = 1 to "strongly agree" = 6)
about several statements. The order of these items was ran-
domized within each question. The full list of relevance
items and judgment items appears in Table SM2 in the
Supplementary Materials. Again after exploratory factor
analysis, we created five moral intuitions scales by averaging
respondents' answers to similar items: care ( = .70), fair-
ness ( = .67), in-group loyalty ( = .75), authority ( = .77),
and purity ( = .86).
Table 1 describes the demographic, social, and political
variables we used in our analyses. Gender ("female" = 1) and
race ("White" = 1) were measured with dummy variables.
Age varied from "18-29" = 1 to "60 or older" = 5. Education
was measured by the highest degree earned: "high school
diploma or GED equivalent" = 1 to "graduate/professional
degree" = 4. Income was measured as approximate yearly
household income: "less than $25,000" = 1 to "$100,000 or
more" = 5. We measured religious affiliation with two
dummy variables ("Christian" and "non-Christian") using
"non-religious" as the reference category. Religiosity was
measured as frequency of attendance of religious services:
"never" = 1 to "once a week or more" = 5. Finally, we again
used exploratory factor analysis to help create an ideology
scale (Cronbach's  = .92), by averaging respondents'
answers to three items meant to tap political, social, and eco-
nomic dimensions of ideology: "very conservative" = 1 to
"very liberal" = 7.2
Analytical Techniques
We conducted our analyses in three stages with IBM SPSS
19. First, we examined the dimensionality of the 20 social
movement identities to determine whether any identity clus-
ters emerge. We performed this via principal components
analysis with Promax rotation with Kaiser Normalization. As
we mentioned in "Measures in the Study" section, these fac-
tor analysis results identify three distinct social movement
identity clusters. Second, we explored the percentages of our
respondents who reported different levels of identification
with the 20 social movements in our study.
Third, we performed a series of ordinary least squares
(OLS) regression analyses to examine the demographic,
social, political, and cultural bases of the three social move-
ment identity clusters. For each social movement identity
cluster, we performed a three-block nested OLS regression
analysis, adding demographic, social, and political charac-
teristics in the first block, values orientations in the second
block, and moral intuitions in the third block. We examined
the results of these regression analyses to determine the
extent to which the measures that emerge from our social
movement identity instrument have construct validity
(Babbie, 1995; Singleton & Straits, 1999). Throughout, we
report conventional significance levels, but as this is a con-
venience sample, p values are probably best interpreted as a
comparison of the effects of a particular independent vari-
able to the potential effects of a purely random variable.
Results and Discussion
Three Social Movement Identity Clusters
The results of our principal components analysis support the
existence of three distinct social movement identity clusters.
Three factors have eigenvalues greater than 1 and factor
loadings greater than 0.4. Furthermore, these three factors
havesubstantialfacevalidity.TableSM3intheSupplementary
Materials displays the factor loadings and eigenvalues from
our principal component analysis.
Our results show that respondents' identification with the
10 left-leaning social movements hangs together as one pro-
gressive movement identity cluster. This cluster consists of
movements from the 1960s to 1970s' protest cycle focused
on extending rights to historically marginalized, oppressed,
or disenfranchised groups; flattening hierarchy; and reducing
violence. Despite conflict and competition among the lead-
ers, organizations, and funders of left-leaning movements
(often discussed as "identity politics") (e.g., Bernstein, 2005;
Schlesinger, 1991), our analysis indicates that laypeople in
the general public seem to identify with this group of move-
ments in a coherent manner. Analyzing nationally represen-
tative survey data from spring 2000 onAmericans'agreement
with the goals of a similar group of movements, McCright
and Dunlap (2008b) find evidence of a progressive social
movement ideology centered on a rights master frame. Even
though we examine movement identity and not agreement
with movement goals, our results nevertheless help confirm
the existence of a progressive social movement family in the
minds of the general public.
Identification with the 10 right-leaning social movements
in our study separates into two distinct clusters, one repre-
senting a traditional and Christian movement identity and
the other tapping a masculinist and libertarian movement
Allen et al. 5
identity. Movements within the former cluster represent a
more traditional and populist conservatism, which promotes
fundamentalist moralism and nativism and also includes the
right wing rage of Tea Party activism in recent years.
Movements within the latter cluster represent a conservatism
focused more specifically on preserving and promoting tra-
ditional views of masculinity, free market fundamentalism,
and patriarchal property rights. To illustrate, this movement
identity cluster likely captures such related activism as the
male-dominated Alt-Right Internet community, property dis-
putes in the Western United States ranging from the 1970s'
Sagebrush Rebellion to the recent conflicts at the Cliven
Bundy ranch in Nevada and the stand-off at a wildlife refuge
headquarters in Oregon, and the vigilant antistatism of many
male advocates of Internet-based cryptocurrency (e.g.,
Bitcoin).
Levels of Identification With 20 Social
Movements
Table 2 shows the percentages of respondents at each level of
identification with each of the 20 social movements. We have
grouped these movements into their three clusters from the
previous section. As our data come from a convenience sam-
ple that skews younger, more liberal, and less religious than
the U.S. general public, we do not present these percentages
as estimates of population characteristics. Rather we offer
them to show the variation in identification with multiple
movements that can be captured with our social movement
identity instrument--variation that likely may prove effica-
cious in explaining movement-related attitudes, beliefs, and
behaviors.As McCright and Dunlap demonstrate with nation-
ally representative data, such a measure of social movement
identity for the environmental movement does help explain
self-reported membership in environmental organizations and
self-reported environmental behaviors (Dunlap & McCright,
2008) as well as movement-related belief systems (McCright
& Dunlap, 2008a)--even better than does a self-identified
environmentalist measure (McCright & Dunlap, 2015).
Given this earlier work on the environmental movement and
the fact that the Gallup Organization continues to include a ver-
sion of the environmental movement identity measure in its
surveys, we first briefly discuss the percentages for the environ-
mental movement identity. As a point of comparison, in its
March 2015 Environment Poll (which was administered 6
weeks prior to our survey), Gallup reports that 16% of its nation-
ally representative sample identifies as an active participant in
the environmental movement, 41% identifies as sympathetic
toward the movement but not active in it, 30% identifies as neu-
tral toward the movement, and 11% identifies as unsympathetic
toward the movement (with 1% reporting "no opinion"). The
percentages for the environmental movement in Table 2 differ

only somewhat from these. In our study, 20.7% of respondents
identify as active participants in the environmental movement,
50.4% identify as sympathetic but not active, 21.4% identify as
neutral, and 7.6% identify as unsympathetic toward or active
opponents of the environmental movement. These more pro-
environmental percentages are most likely due to greater per-
centages of liberals and younger adults in our sample than in the
general public--as these two groups tend to report high levels
of environmentalism (e.g., Dunlap, Van Liere, Mertig, & Jones,
2000; Dunlap, Xiao, & McCright, 2001). This comparison
offers at least modest evidence that this social movement iden-
tity measure can distinguish different levels of identification
with a social movement in what we argue is a meaningful way.
A few key patterns in Table 2 warrant some discussion.
First, not surprising given the nature of our sample, we see
stronger identification with left-leaning or liberal movements
than with right-leaning or conservative movements among
our respondents. Between 38.4% and 72.9% of our respon-
dents indicate that they are sympathetic toward or active par-
ticipants in a liberal movement, yet only between 10.5% and
34.5% of our respondents report being sympathetic toward or
actively participating in a conservative movement.
Second, patterns of identification within the group of 10
left-leaning movements seem to align with the salience and/or
mobilization of these movements in recent years. For instance,
the three left-leaning movements with the lowest percentages
of sympathetics or active participants either emerged prior to
the 1960s to 1970s' rights-based protest cycle (labor move-
ment: 46.4%) or are movements relatively circumscribed in
their focus (antinuclear movement: 38.4%; gun control move-
ment: 46.6%). The remaining seven movements, which have
more substantive origins in this rights-based protest cycle each
enjoy clear majorities of sympathetics or active participants.
Indeed, the three left-leaning movements with the highest per-
centages of active participants--approximately 20% for the
environmental, animal rights, and gay and lesbian rights
movements--each have experienced considerable mobiliza-
tion and have garnered much media coverage in recent years.
Third, very low percentages of our respondents are active
participants in the 10 conservative movements, and only
relatively small percentages are sympathetic toward these
movements. Distinguishing the five masculinist and libertar-
ian movements from those traditional and Christian move-
ments reveals another interesting pattern.Although majorities
of our respondents are either unsympathetic toward or active
opponents of the five traditional conservative movements,
near majorities or majorities are neutral toward the five mas-
culinity-based or libertarian movements--suggesting less
public familiarity with this latter group of movements.
Demographic, Social, Political, and Cultural Bases
of Three Social Movement Identity Clusters
We now turn to the results of our three-block nested OLS
regression analyses that help us identify the demographic,
social, political, and cultural bases of the three social move-
ment identity clusters. Tables SM4 to SM6 in the
Supplementary Materials display the full results of this
regression analysis for each cluster, respectively. Table 3
presents the results of the final OLS regression model for
each cluster. The average variance inflation factor (VIF) in
the full models is 1.79, with the highest VIF of 2.90 for the
authority moral intuition, indicating no substantial problems
with multicollinearity.
The first model in Table 3 explains approximately 56% of
the variation in identification with progressive social move-
ments. As Table SM4 indicates, gender and political ideol-
ogy alone account for about four fifths of this explained
variance. Females and liberals report much stronger identifi-
cation with these progressive social movements than do their
male and conservative counterparts. Furthermore, altruism
toward other humans and a moral intuition of nurturing care
each has a moderately strong positive effect on progressive
social movement identity, while a purity moral intuition of
abhorrence for things perceived as disgusting has a small
negative effect.
The second model in Table 3 explains approximately 58%
of the variation in identification with traditional and Christian
social movements. As indicated in Table SM5, a small set of
demographic, social, and political variables account for
about 85% of this explained variance, with political ideology
having the strongest effect of these variables. Briefly,
females, lesser educated adults, less wealthy adults, more
religious individuals, and political conservatives report
stronger identification with these traditional and Christian
conservative movements. Also, openness to change has a
small negative effect and traditionalism has a small positive
effect on identification with these movements. Furthermore,
abhorrence for things perceived as disgusting (a purity moral
intuition) has a moderately strong positive effect on identifi-
cation with these conservative movements.3
The third model in Table 3 explains approximately 21%
of the variation in identification with masculinist and liber-
tarian social movements. As Table SM6 indicates, three
social and political variables account for slightly more than
half of this explained variance. Lesser educated adults, less
wealthy individuals, and conservatives report stronger iden-
tification with these movements than do their respective
counterparts. In addition, a traditionalist value orientation
and in-group loyalty (tribalism) and purity moral intuitions
each have weak positive effects on this masculinist and liber-
tarian movement identity. Interestingly, both ideology and
purity have a considerably stronger influence on traditional
and Christian movement identity than on masculinist and lib-
ertarian movement identity.
Overall, these results provide reasonably strong evidence
that the measures from our social movement identity instru-
ment have construct validity (Babbie, 1995; Singleton &
Straits, 1999). Briefly, our measures of social movement
identities are related to other key conceptualizations in
Allen et al. 7
theoretically expected ways. Liberal ideology has a much
stronger influence on the first two clusters (positive for pro-
gressive movement identity and negative for traditional and
Christian movement identity) than on the third cluster (nega-
tive for masculinist and libertarian movement identity), con-
firming our expectation that this third cluster is centered
more on masculinity and property than on traditional politi-
cal conservatism.
In addition, the strong positive effects of humanistic altru-
ism and a moral intuition of care on progressive social move-
ment identity confirm that the latter is capturing an
other-centered concern for improving the condition of mar-
ginalized or oppressed others that is central to progressive
social movements. Also, the strong positive effects of a
moral intuition of purity (a concern for sanctity) and religios-
ity--as well as the weak negative effect of openness to
change and weak positive effect of traditionalism--on tradi-
tional and Christian movement identity confirm that the lat-
ter is representing a concern for promoting the social and
cultural conservatism that is central to traditional and
Christian movements.
Furthermore, the fact that purity has a much stronger posi-
tive effect on traditional and Christian movement identity
than on masculinist and libertarian movement identity con-
firms that the latter identity cluster is less aligned with
traditional conservatism, while the former identity cluster is
more aligned with fundamentalist moralism and nativism.
Finally, the negative effects of socioeconomic status (educa-
tion and income) and the positive effects of traditionalism
and a moral intuition of in-group loyalty on masculinist and
libertarian movement identity confirm that the latter is tap-
ping a concern for protecting the market-based patriarchal
power that has eroded in recent decades due to macro-level
economic shifts that is central to masculinist and libertarian
movements.
Conclusion
We showcased a revised version of the social movement
identity instrument first presented by Dunlap and McCright
(2008) and demonstrated the efficacy of this revised instru-
ment for investigating identification with 20 major U.S.
social movements. Briefly, even though scholars may use
this instrument to examine identification with individual
movements, we chose to demonstrate how this instrument
may help us understand identification with social movement
families. We found strong evidence of three social movement
identity clusters--progressive movements, traditional and
Christian movements, and masculinist and libertarian move-
ments--that align with recognizable movement families in

the United States. We also showed that our instrument cap-
tures meaningful variation across the levels of identification
with these 20 social movements. Furthermore, we provided
strong evidence that our instrument has construct validity, as
selected predictors explained variation in social movement
identities in ways expected by existing theory and previous
research.
Of course, there are opportunities for further improve-
ment of our instrument. First, to guard against overestimat-
ing active participants and active opponents, scholars could
provide a few examples of behaviors that would be consid-
ered active participation and active opposition. Second,
rather than providing the name of a social movement, schol-
ars instead could provide a brief description of the movement
(or perhaps include both). Offering a brief description may
reduce the likelihood that respondents are influenced by
name-related associations. Third, in many samples, it is pos-
sible that some respondents will not have heard of some
movements. To accommodate this, we suggest considering
the addition of another response category to capture this.
Fourth, we urge scholars to use our instrument in conjunction
with established self-reported measures of movement behav-
iors and movement organization membership. Doing so pro-
vides further opportunities to validate our instrument and
advance the social movements scholarship.
We end by proposing an agenda for future research that
uses the social movement identity instrument showcased
above to investigate understudied rank-and-file movement
participants, sympathetic adherents, and even unsympathetic
opponents in the public. Such scholarship may complement
the typical strategy of analyzing key leaders of movement
organizations or other samples of known activists. Also,
other researchers should feel free to populate this instrument
with those social movements of interest to them.
First, this instrument allows scholars to analyze key char-
acteristics of individuals across different social movement
identity levels. Such characteristics may include beliefs
about movement goals, support for movement strategies,
and trust in the responsiveness of political authorities. For
instance, McCright and Dunlap (2008) discover substantial
differences across active participants, sympathetics, neu-
trals, and unsympathetics vis-à-vis the environmental move-
ment in the consistency of their beliefs about environmental
problems.
Second, administering this social movement identity
instrument to a nationally representative sample would allow
scholars to examine the extent to which participation in, or
mere support for, some movements is associated with the
same for other movements, helping extend earlier research
on activists' involvement with multiple movements (e.g.,
Van Dyke, 2003). Such work should examine not only public
support for and engagement with left-leaning social move-
ments but also should examine the same for right-leaning
movements, which tend to be understudied in the social
movements literature. Furthermore, scholars may use this
instrument in work examining how citizens across the left-
right political spectrum differentially consume and contrib-
ute to politically framed, movement-related social media.
Third, including this social movement identity instrument in
panel surveys would allow us to monitor the extent to which
citizens' participation in, support for, or opposition to social
movements vary over time, complementing Minkoff (1997).
Indeed, merging such survey data with relevant contextual data
on, for example, movement-related media coverage or the
presence of elite allies and opponents would facilitate analyses
of how different contextual factors influence social movement
identity across space and over time. Finally, this instrument
enables an examination of the social, political, and cultural
bases of social movement identities among the general public.
This would allow us to investigate the breadth or narrowness of
support for or opposition to different movements and whether
such support or opposition diffuses to a broader base over time.

Notes
1. Some scholars, especially those only examining a single
movement, may choose to create their own composite mea-
sures of social movement identity, capturing the key dimen-
sions of identification with their movement with multi-item
indicators. For instance, for some research questions and types
of analyses, a composite measure of environmental movement
identity (which captures subtle distinctions between conser-
vationism and preservationism and between anthropocentrism
and ecocentrism across local, national, and international foci
of concern) may perform better than the Dunlap and McCright
(2008) measure. Yet, the former will require much time on a
survey and may significantly heighten respondent fatigue (an
increasing worry among survey researchers), while the latter
carries neither of these risks. Indeed, using a single-item mea-
sure of social movement identity allows researchers more time
for measures of other key concepts of interest. For those schol-
ars interested in examining movement identity across multiple
movements on a single survey, a single-item measure of social
movement identity might be the only reasonable option given
the need to use survey time economically and populate the rest
of the survey with other key measures.

2. The three items were as follows:
·
· Thinking about POLITICAL issues, do you think of
yourself as liberal or conservative?
·
· Thinking about SOCIAL issues, do you think of your-
self as liberal or conservative?
·
· Thinking about ECONOMIC issues, do you think of
yourself as liberal or conservative?
These three items contained the same response categories: very
liberal, liberal, slightly liberal, middle-of-the-road, slightly
conservative, conservative, and very conservative.
3. Model 1 in Table SM5 shows that Christians report stronger
identification with this cluster of movements, yet this effect dis-
appears in Model 3 in Table SM5. This suggests that a purity
moral intuition may mediate the relationship between Christian
identification and traditional and Christian movement identity.
To explore this, we performed a Sobel-Goodman mediation test
using Stata 14.1; this test confirmed such a mediation effect.
