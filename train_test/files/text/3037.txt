Context Overweight and obesity are increasing dramatically in the United States and
most likely contribute substantially to the burden of chronic health conditions.
Objective To describe the relationship between weight status and prevalence of health
conditions by severity of overweight and obesity in the US population.
Design and Setting Nationally representative cross-sectional survey using data from
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), which was
conducted in 2 phases from 1988 to 1994.
Participants A total of 16 884 adults, 25 years and older, classified as overweight
and obese (body mass index [BMI] 25 kg/m2) based on National Institutes of Health
recommended guidelines.
Main Outcome Measures Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, gallbladder dis-
ease, coronary heart disease, high blood cholesterol level, high blood pressure, or os-
teoarthritis.
Results Sixty-three percent of men and 55% of women had a body mass index of
25 kg/m2 or greater. A graded increase in the prevalence ratio (PR) was observed with
increasing severity of overweight and obesity for all of the health outcomes except for
coronary heart disease in men and high blood cholesterol level in both men and women.
With normal-weight individuals as the reference, for individuals with BMIs of at least
40 kg/m2 and who were younger than 55 years, PRs were highest for type 2 diabetes
for men (PR, 18.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7-46.8) and women (PR, 12.9;
95% CI, 5.7-28.1) and gallbladder disease for men (PR, 21.1; 95% CI, 4.1-84.2) and
women (PR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.9-8.9). Prevalence ratios generally were greater in younger
than in older adults. The prevalence of having 2 or more health conditions increased
with weight status category across all racial and ethnic subgroups.
Conclusions Based on these results, more than half of all US adults are considered over-
weight or obese. The prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities emphasizes the need
forconcertedeffortstopreventandtreatobesityratherthanjustitsassociatedcomorbidities.

Overweight and Obesity Criteria
The survey protocol included a home
interview and a standardized physical
examination in a mobile examination
center or a limited examination in the
subject's home for subjects unable to
travel. In both settings, body weight and
height were measured by trained tech-
nicians with standardized equipment
and procedures.
We used the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute's definitions for the
cutoff points between overweight and
obesity and between obese and its class
levels.11 Using a reference category of
BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 (termed nor-
mal weight), the 4 classes as shown in
TABLE 1, which also lists the World
Health Organization's cutoff points.1
Both organizations use the same catego-
ries with the exception of the BMI range
of 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2 category: WHO
calls it preobese and the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute calls it over-
weight. Both organizations consider per-
sons with a BMI of between 25.0 and
29.9 kg/m2 to be overweight.
Among the 16 884 subjects at least 25
years old, we excluded pregnant wo-
men (n = 164) and persons who did not
have height or weight measurements
(n = 1719).
Health Outcomes
On the basis of previous research, we
selected for study health conditions for
which excess weight is an established
risk factor and for which sample sizes
were adequate. These conditions in-
cluded high blood pressure, type 2 DM,
high blood cholesterol level, coronary
heart disease (CHD), and gallbladder
disease. In addition, for analyses that
considered the number of comorbidi-
ties, osteoarthritis was included.
Highbloodpressurewasdeemedpres-
ent if subjects reported that a physi-
cian had ever told them that they had
hypertension or high blood pressure,
or if the mean of at least 3 blood pres-
sure readings (measured by NHANES
technicians) exceeded 140 mm Hg sys-
tolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic. The spe-
cific details of the blood pressure mea-
surements are published elsewhere.20
The average of all available blood pres-
sure measurements was used.
Ideally, type 2 DM should be de-
fined based on self-report of physician
diagnosis and fasting plasma glucose
levels. However, fasting plasma glu-
cose levels were unavailable for 44% of
the sample. Therefore, type 2 DM was
defined only by self-report of diag-
nosed disease. Because the structured
interview item for physician-diag-
nosed DM did not distinguish type 1
from type 2 DM, we identified sub-
jects with type 2 DM on the basis of the
information provided in the question-
naire. We started with all those who re-
sponded affirmatively to the question:
"Has a physician ever told you have dia-
betes?" We then excluded those who
reported having DM only during preg-
nancy. Of those who remained, we ex-
cluded those with type 1 DM (diagno-
sis before age 30 years and number of
years of insulin use equal to within 1
year of duration of disease). Those who
remained were considered to have type
2 DM. This approach may misclassify
a small number of persons with type 2
DM as having type 1 DM, and an even
smaller number of persons with late-
onset type 1 DM as having type 2 DM.
Subjects were classified as having
high blood cholesterol levels if they
reported that a physician had told them
such or if measured serum cholesterol
levels exceeded 6.2 mmol/L (240
mg/dL). Levels were determined by
contract laboratories using reference
analytical methods.21
A diagnosis of CHD was based on a
history of having had a "heart attack,"
congestive heart failure, or angina.
Heart attack and congestive heart fail-
ure were based on self-report of phy-
sician diagnosis. The location of chest
pain as described by self-report was
used for classification of angina based
on established criteria.22

Data Analysis
All analyses were conducted using

plex sample designs.23 Sample weights
were applied to produce nationally
representative estimates. Prevalence
estimates were calculated by cross-
tabulation. Race- and ethnicity-specific
estimates were calculated for non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
andMexicanAmericans.Otherracialand

these analyses, we calculated crude
prevalences only for type 2 DM, gall-
bladder disease, high cholesterol levels,
high blood pressure, and osteoarthritis
as obesity-related comorbidities. Coro-
nary heart disease was not included in
these analyses because hypertension,
high cholesterol levels, and type 2 DM
may be in the causal pathway for heart
disease. If these conditions are interme-
diateeventsinthedevelopmentofCHD,
it would not be correct to count them as
2 separate health conditions.
RESULTS
Based on the NHANES III sample, ap-
proximately 63% of men and 55% of
women aged 25 years or older in the US
population were overweight or obese
(TABLE 2). Specifically, 42% of men and
28% of women were overweight, and

21% of men and 27% of women were
obese. The crude prevalence estimates
showed a generally similar magnitude
and pattern across racial and ethnic
groups by sex with 2 exceptions: among
non-Hispanic white women the preva-
lence of BMI of 25 kg/m2 or higher
(overweight or obesity) was lower and
among Mexican American men preva-
lence was higher compared with other
racial or ethnic sex groups.
Forbothmenandwomen,highblood
pressure was the most common over-
weight- and obesity-related health con-
dition and its prevalence showed a
strong increase with increasing weight
status category (TABLE 3). The preva-
lence of type 2 DM, gallbladder dis-
ease,andosteoarthritisincreasedsharply
among both overweight and obese men
and women corresponding with the in-
creasing weight classes. High blood cho-
lesterol level was very prevalent in both
sexes but showed no increase in preva-
lence with increasing weight category.
However, men and women with BMIs
of 25 kg/m2 or more, were more likely
than persons of normal weight to have
high blood cholesterol levels. Because
these estimates are not adjusted for age
or smoking status, they reflect the pres-
ence of these health conditions in the US
population.
Sex-specific PRs by weight class for
thehealthconditionsconsideredshowed
no evidence of race and ethnicityÂ­
weight class interactions for either sex.
(Racial-andethnic-specificPRsareavail-
able from A.M.) Significant interac-
tionsbetweenweightstatuscategoryand
age group (55 years, 55 years) were
observed for all health outcomes exam-
ined, except for CHD (TABLE 4).
Type 2DMshowed a strongincrease
inprevalencewithincreasingoverweight
classamongbothyoungerandoldersub-
jects. The PR associated with elevated
weight was 3- to 4-fold greater among
younger overweight men and women.
Among those in the most obese group,
the PR for younger men was 18.1 (95%
CI,6.7-46.8)and12.9(95%CI,5.7-28.1)
for younger women. Among older men
and women, PRs were more moderate
butstillsubstantiallyelevated,withaPR
of 3.4 (95% CI, 1.1-8.3) for the most
obesemen,and5.8(95%CI,4.2-7.4)for
the most obese women.
The PRs for gallbladder disease dif-
fered substantially by sex. Men younger
than 55 years exhibited a marked in-
crease in PRs for gallbladder disease
with increasing weight status, with a PR
of 21.1 (95% CI, 4.1-84.2) observed in
the highest obesity class. Among older
men, a weaker gradient of PRs was ob-
served. For women, for whom the
condition is more than twice as preva-
lent as it is among men, a steady in-
crease in the PRs for gallbladder dis-
ease with increasing weight status
category was observed in both age
groups, with a PR of 1.9 (95% CI, 1.3-
3.0) for overweight women younger
than 55 years.
Unlike the other comorbidities ex-
amined, the PRs for CHD did not dif-
fer by age group. Prevalence ratios were
not elevated among the overweight but
were significantly elevated in obesity
class 1 for men and in all 3 obesity
classes for women. Among these obese
classes, PRs ranged from 1.6 among
obesity class 1 women (95% CI, 1.2-
2.1) to 3.0 among obesity class 3
women (95% CI, 2.1-4.2). The linear
trend of BMI was statistically signifi-
cant for both sexes.
The PRs for high cholesterol level ex-
hibited a different pattern than that ob-
served for the other overweight- and
obesity-related comorbidities. Among
younger men and for women, PRs
for most classes of overweight and
obesity were elevated compared with
the reference group (BMI, 18.5-24.9
kg/m2), but there was no evidence of a
gradient of PRs with increasing weight
status category. Among older sub-
jects, PRs were significantly increased
only for overweight individuals.
A steeply graded association be-
tween weight class and high blood pres-
sure was observed in men and women
younger than 55 years, with eleva-
tions observed even among those in the
overweight class, for which PRs were
almost doubled compared with nor-
mal weight individuals. Among older
men and women, statistically signifi-
cant elevations in this highly preva-
lent condition were observed, begin-
ning with the overweight category and
increasing across weight categories.

morbidities by overweight class for each

COMMENT
In this study, we estimated the cross-
sectional relationship between over-
weight and obesity class levels and mor-
bidity in a contemporary, nationally
representative sample of adults. We ob-
served a substantial prevalence of
chronic health conditions in associa-
tion with elevated BMI for both age
groups and across racial and ethnic
groups.Associationsofweightstatusand
health outcomes did not differ be-
tween the 3 major racial and ethnic
groups.ThePRsgenerallyincreasedwith
increasing severity and, for many co-
morbidities, the PRs were significantly
elevated even for the overweight class
(BMI, 25.0-29.9 kg/m2). Because the
sample is cross-sectional, the data re-
flect the burden of disease associated
with overweight and obesity in the US
population aged 25 years and older from
1988 to 1994.
Weobservedparticularlystrongcross-
sectionalassociationsforoverweightand
obesity with type 2 DM and hyperten-
sion, consistent with the findings of
several large cohort studies based on
nonrepresentative populations.26,27 Fur-
thermore, we found a significant in-
crease in PRs of both of these condi-
tions even among persons in the
overweight class. This finding is strik-
ing given that individuals with the mild-
est degree of overweight comprise more
than 42% of men and 28% of women in
the United States. For the majority of
healthconditionsstudied,basedonover-
weight status and age, PRs are in-
creased. Our analyses incorporate the
newly adopted definitions of over-
weightandobesity.1,11 ThepreviousBMI
cutoff points of 27.8 (men) and 27.3
(women) kg/m2 were based on a purely
statisticaldefinition(85thpercentilefrom
NHANES II). The new cutoff point of 25
kg/m2 is based on research evidence that
linksanelevatedBMIwithadversehealth
consequences,13 including type 2 DM,
hypertension, cardiovascular dis-
ease,28-30 and death.31 The prevalence es-

timates based on these definitions dif-
fer slightly from those published by
Flegal and colleagues.4 Their report was
based on adults 20 years or older,
whereas our report includes adults aged
25 years or older.
Although the relationship of BMI
with body fatness may differ by race and
ethnicity,32-34 whether the relation-
ship between weight status (based on
BMI) and adverse health outcomes dif-
fers by race and ethnicity is less clear.
The pattern of the PRs in relation to
weight class was consistent across all
3 racial and ethnic groups for all of the
health outcomes we examined, de-
spite differences in the distribution of
BMI by race and ethnicity.
The influence of age on the relation-
ship of BMI to morbidity and mortal-
ity has been the subject of some de-
bate, especially for prospective studies
of mortality.35-37 For both hyperten-
sion28 and CHD,38 the relative risk as-
sociated with overweight declines with
age. We observed that the cross-
sectional relationship of obesity class
to the comorbidities studied was gen-
erally strongest among the younger age
groups. Nonetheless, the PRs were sig-
nificantly elevated in the older age
group except for gallbladder disease
in men and high cholesterol level in
both sexes.
Our analysis of multiple comorbidi-
ties did not include CHD, because of
the potential for "double-counting" of
CHD with known cardiovascular risk
factors such as hypertension, type 2
DM, and high blood cholesterol level.
Our consideration of only the most
common obesity-related comorbidi-
ties and avoidance of double counting
suggests that we have likely underes-
timated the disease burden associated
with overweight in the population. The
burden to the individual is increased for
those with more severe obesity be-
cause they are more likely to develop
a second or even a third morbidity.
Our approach has several limita-
tions. Foremost, a cross-sectional ap-
proach to evaluate the relationship of
obesity to the morbidities that we ex-
amined does not provide evidence for
causality. In some individuals, weight
loss may accompany some of these
conditions, particularly CHD. Because
persons in the higher obesity classes
were at increased risk of death, we may
have underestimated the impact of
weight on adverse health, particularly
among older individuals. Reliance on
self-report of physician-diagnosed dis-
ease underestimates disease burden.
For example, a definition based on self-
report of diagnosed disease underesti-
mates DM prevalence by more than
50%.15 The known association between
overweight and chronic health condi-
tions increases the likelihood of diag-
nosis in heavier people and represents
an additional source of bias. In addi-
tion, using BMI as a weight measure
provides an indirect measure of fatness
and does not reflect fat distribution,
which may affect the risk of comorbid-
ity independent of BMI. Moreover, BMI
does not distinguish between fat mass
and lean tissue mass and may underes-
timate fatness in older adults who have
greater amount of body fat at a given
BMI than younger ones, due to age-re-
lated declines in muscle mass.39 Fur-
thermore, we did not adjust our cross-
sectional statistical models for variables
often included in models that estimate

Comorbidities considered included type 2 diabetes, gallbladder disease, high blood cholesterol level, high blood
pressure, and osteoarthritis. Normal weight indicates body mass index of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2; overweight, 25.0
to 29.9 kg/m2; obesity class 1, 30.0 to 34.9 kg/m2; obesity class 2, 35.0 to 39.9 kg/m2; and obesity class 3, greater
than 40.0 kg/m2. Data are based on the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

incidence (rather than prevalence) of
obesity-related comorbidities such as
fat distribution, diet, or exercise, be-
cause the temporal sequence in cross-
sectional data is not established. Our
results might have changed if these
variables had been included. However,
the consistency of our cross-sectional
findings with incident chronic disease
in several large prospective studies26-29
suggests that the cross-sectional asso-
ciations we observed are likely to re-
flect true associations. The aforemen-
tioned misclassification and biases
would likely have a minor impact on
the magnitude of these estimates.
Inconclusion,thesenationaldatasug-
gest that clinicians are likely to encoun-
ter morbidity more frequently among
their patients with elevated BMI, even
those patients in the overweight cat-
egory. A general pattern of increasing
prevalence with increasing severity of
overweight and obesity is consistent
across racial and ethnic groups for all of
the health conditions considered, with
the exception of high blood cholesterol
level. Without concerted initiatives to
prevent and treat overweight in adults,
the health care system will increasingly
be overwhelmed with individuals who
require treatment for obesity-related
health conditions.
