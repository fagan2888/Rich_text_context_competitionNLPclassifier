Introduction
Kerr (1988) described family systems theory as assuming
the existence of two opposing but instinctually rooted life
forces. One pole of this force, according to Kerr, dictates a
natural emergence of individuality and emotional separate-
ness, whereas the other keeps family members operating in
reaction to one another. The birth of a child is typically seen
as the latter of the two opposing forces, as it exemplifies
intense and intimate physical and emotional involvement by
the mother to ensure the very survival of the infant. This
seems to be an important evolutionary process and is univer-
sally obvious in mammalian relationships (Kerr, 1988).
In the study of family relationships, however, it is vital to
consider the interaction of these forces and to recognize that
the mother­child connectedness is not only symbiotic but
also represents the beginnings of the reciprocity that is a
characteristic of familial interactions (Parker, 1995).
According to Love (1990), the mother as well as the child
thrives on the physical contact, intimacy, and unconditional
love that is reminiscent of parent­infant interactions. Love
further described the mother­infant relationship as an emo-
tional attachment that often requires offsetting forces to keep
it within healthy bounds. It is precisely this emotional fusion,
or at least the potential for it, that parents are charged with
resolving by engaging in behaviors that are designed to pro-
mote and permit the emergence of individuality and healthy
emotional development (Kerr, 1988). In other words, it is the
responsibility of the parent to provide the child the "secure
base from which the child can venture forth into the wider
world and return to as a safe haven of reassurance"
(Schwartzman, 2006, p. 226).
It is not the goal of this contribution to promote total
emotional separateness from one's family of origin as a
mental health standard. Disengagement, according to
Williams and Hiebert (2001), is the polar opposite of the
subject of this contribution. While enmeshment can pose
debilitating challenges to a child's emotional and social
development, disengagement, too, it seems, can be just as
devastating. For family systems, as well as other mental
health practitioners, it is common knowledge that either
extreme (disengagement or enmeshment) would be counter-
productive to adaptive emotional functioning (Barbarin &
Tirado, 1985; Gavazzi, 1993; Minuchin, 1974; Williams &
Hiebert, 2001). Rather, family systems researchers, theorists,
writers, and practitioners generally view interdependence and
reciprocity within family systems to be a healthy mechanism
for promoting personal growth (Bradshaw, 1989; Forward,
1989; Hann-Morrison, 2006; Love, 1990; Minuchin, 1974).
An important task of parenting, then, is one of striking a
healthy balance between attachment to the child and separat-
ing in a way that encourages and supports the child's develop-
ment of autonomy.
Within each of the three subsystems of the family intro-
duced by Minuchin (1974), healthy interactions are marked
by interdependence and mutual give and take. Although the
spousal-, parental-, and sibling subsystems operate as dis-
tinct units within the system, Minuchin also purported that
healthy interactions and boundaries between and among
subsystems contribute to adaptive development of the fam-
ily unit. The spousal subsystem, for example, is a unit con-
tained within itself, but yet that functions also as a parental
subsystem. Strength in one subsystem may be related to
strength in other subsystems within the family. Conversely,
it seems, breaches in one subsystem are intimately related to
boundary violations in other subsystems. The emotionally

Abstract
This contribution will undertake a discussion of emotionally incestuous mother­son relationships.After a brief, but general
discussion that defines such concepts as enmeshment,differentiation and individuation,the discussion will focus on how family
system breaches adversely affect children's social and emotional development.Then specific attention will be given to the
long-term adverse impacts of unhealthy mother­son relationships.

unavailable spouse, for example, may provide the opening
for discord in parenting, and even in sibling relationships, it
seems (Minuchin, 1974).
Although healthy "give and take" may be the standard,
and therefore easily observable in the spousal unit, we will
focus our attention on the interactions between parent and
child. Most practitioners, theorists, and instructors of family
systems theory concur that healthy interactions between par-
ents and their children can be defined in fairly broad terms.
No definition, however, can reasonably preclude parents'
basic responsibility for the provision of food, clothing, and
shelter. Even then, the responsibility of parents for their chil-
dren's emotional development extends broadly to such areas
as parental assignment of age-appropriate privileges and
responsibilities, encouragement of children's independence,
establishment of clear guidelines and rules, and the appropri-
ate exchange of physical affection (Barbarin & Tirado, 1985;
Barber & Buehler, 1996).
Bowen (1978) introduced the concept of self-differentiation
as a vital component in children's emotional and social
growth and in their development of independence. Differ-
entiation, in Bowen's conceptualization, is an evolving
process that requires effort on the part of the child. More
importantly, according to Bowen, self-differentiation of the
child is mostly a product of the parent's active efforts to
promote the development of an autonomous identity. Bowen
termed this process individuation, and charges parents with
being the primary catalysts for its development. The parent,
according to Bowenian notion, is charged with the develop-
ment of the child's differentiation by not only supporting the
child's effort but also by actively creating and encouraging
opportunities for increasing degrees of emotional separation.
The well-differentiated person, according to Knudson-Martin
(1994), is inner directed, autonomous, and can function sepa-
rately within relationships. Knudson-Martin (1994) described
this person as "a solid self . . . made up of firmly held convic-
tions and beliefs which are formed slowly and can be changed
only from within the self" (p. 38). The aforementioned polar
forces of attachment and separateness, as proposed by Kerr
(1988), seem to be the catalyst for the evolution of differen-
tiation in the family system (Theriault, 1997). Theorists pro-
pose that at least one characteristic of differentiation is the
person who can successfully separate from his parents while
still maintaining attachment bonds with them (Anderson &
Sabatelli, 1992; Theriault, 1997). Barber and Buehler (1996)
described the experience of differentiated people as an inher-
ent freedom to think and feel independently of their families
without feeling a sense of betrayal.
Differentiation levels in families are often manifested in
the family members' interactional patterns. How and to what
degree family members engage with one another provide
clues to the provision and maintenance of interpersonal
space within the family unit? Interpersonal space, in turn,
serves as indication of the family's level of tolerance for
individuality (Anderson & Sabatelli, 1992; Manzi, Vignoles,
Regalia, & Scabini, 2006).
Enmeshment
Barber and Buehler (1996) defined enmeshment as "family
patterns that facilitate psychological and emotional fusion
among family members, potentially inhibiting the individu-
ation process and the development and maintenance
of psychosocial maturity" (p. 433). Barber and Buehler
contended, further, that enmeshment is a culprit in chil-
dren's stifled development of skills to deal adequately with
common social stressors. Enmeshed families are character-
ized by levels of emotional closeness that are often seen as
constraining. These families use manipulation, usually in
the form of overly excessive, but superficial expressions of
love and unity to demand loyalty from their members.
Conflicts are blanketed under the guise of solidarity
and great effort is expended in maintaining the status
quo. Members of enmeshed families typically describe their
families as conflict free, while at the same time, these very
units are characterized by high demands for conformity
(Barbarin & Tirado, 1985; Williams & Hiebert, 2001).
Enmeshed families depend on each other excessively.
Paradoxically, members of these families tend to have a
limited sense of their own identity, and therefore make deci-
sions based on emotions, and as a reaction to the perceived
wishes of other members of the system (Kinnier, Brigman,
& Noble, 1990).
So profound is the impact of enmeshment on families that
researchers have determined there to be relationships
between these unhealthy familial interactions and physiolog-
ical functioning. Mengel, Davis, Abell, and Baker (1991)
noted previous findings of an increased probability of low
birth weight among infants born into families who fit the
characterization of being enmeshed. This same team of
researchers also discovered a positive correlation between
maternal blood pressure and family enmeshment. According
to Mengel et al. (1991), the stress produced by the intensive
stifling of autonomy in enmeshed family systems serves to
exact adverse physiological consequences on expectant
mothers. These women tend to have elevated blood pressure
during the gestational period. With controlled health factors,
pregnant women from enmeshed systems tend to show at
least an average increase of 3 mmHg in systolic blood pres-
sure, as compared with a control group. Other physiological
implications of family enmeshment include findings of the
effectiveness of structural therapy as a tool in facilitating
greater management of diabetes in adolescents. These kinds
of physiological responses, as said by Mengel et al. (1991),
are likely the products of delayed conflict resolution and
poor or maladaptive family coping options.
It is only prudent that a word of caution be interjected
here. Some may argue, and reasonably so, that family sup-
port and togetherness is associated with positive outcomes
in times of distress. Moreover, family support seems crucial
in propelling people forward in their personal and profes-
sional lives. More than a decade ago, Barber and Buehler
(1996) sought to clarify those family factors that support
Hann-Morrison 3
individuation from those that stifle emotional development.
Cohesion and enmeshment, the researchers assert, are not
linear, but, more importantly, are conceptually different
notions. Barber and Buehler clearly deciphered between
enmeshment and its relative cohesion. Although enmesh-
ment is rooted in manipulation and control, they say,
cohesion is a positive trait that is an example of supportive
family interactions. Cohesion, according to Barber and
Buehler (1996), is defined as "shared affection, support,
helpfulness, and caring among family members" (p. 433).
Manzi et al. (2006) added to this definition the notion of
tolerance of intimacy as a vital component in understand-
ing cohesion, as opposed to enmeshment. Like their fellow
researchers 10 years earlier, Manzi et al. confirmed that
family cohesion and family enmeshment are two separate
and distinct constructs. Like Barber and Buehler, Manzi
et al. found that cohesion was related to positive behavioral
outcomes and psychological well-being among adoles-
cents. Furthermore, Manzi et al. were able to consistently
demonstrate the existence of a positive correlation between
family cohesion and positive adolescent behavioral
outcomes across cultural lines. Both research teams found
an inverse relationship between enmeshment and positive
behavioral outcomes and psychological well-being.
The enmeshed system may be summarized, then, as having
both internal and external boundary management problems.
In enmeshed systems, internal boundaries that define inter-
personal familial relationships are weak, whereas boundar-
ies to the world outside of the system are rigid (Manzi
et al., 2006).
Maternal Enmeshment
Although we have given discussion to enmeshed systems,
we will now consider the issue of the enmeshed relationship
between a parent and a particular child. We will refer to the
victim of maternal enmeshment as the "chosen child," to
borrow a concept provided by Love (1990, p. 8). Parental
enmeshment not only hinders but also prevents differentia-
tion of the child, resulting in a dance of circular immaturity
and reactivity between the parent and child (Minuchin,
1974). Bevcar and Bevcar (1996) described the enmeshed
parent as one who blurs familial boundaries and engages in
hovering behaviors. These parents, they contend, are overly
accessible to their children and they simply "do too much"
(Bevcar & Bevcar, 1996, p. 193) for their children. The end
result, they add, is a loss of autonomy by the child.
These children, then, according to Bevcar and Bevcar
(1996), tend to rely on their parents instead of on their own
capabilities. They develop a fear of experimentation, a fear
of failure, and a fear of success. Grotevant and Cooper
(1986) provided evidence that diffusion of family boundaries
was highly correlated with lowered tendency toward explor-
atory behaviors by adolescents, whereas Gavazzi (1993)
showed that adolescents from systems where mothers are
deemed to be enmeshed not only show difficulties in format-
ting identity but they also have difficulties in participating in
interdependent peer relationships. Gavazzi (1993) con-
tended, further, that these children tend to view themselves
as forever in need of other people's assistance and will con-
tinue to call on family members for help in decision
making.
As indicated in previous sections of this contribution, par-
enting offers some rewards that are not only gratifying for the
child but for the mother as well. Some of the parental benefits
require the presence of offsetting forces if adaptive boundar-
ies between parent and child are to develop and be maintained
(Love, 1990). In this author's more than 10 years of clinical
experience, often is the case when, despite the existence of
other relationship obligations, a mother may stretch the limits
of parenting far beyond what is healthy. In such cases, these
relationships are laden with boundary violations and breaches
of familial subsystems. A case synopsis might serve to illus-
trate the nature of maternal enmeshment:
While delivering Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST) in
the home of a former client, the case of maternal
enmeshment was blaringly evident. The 8-week inten-
sive in-home service delivery model afforded this
provider an in-depth look at the true workings of this
particular family system. While the entire system pre-
sented with overt characteristics of enmeshment
(seven of nine adult male children between the ages of
34 and 49 had never been married, and paid daily vis-
its to the family matriarch; the mother prepared daily
meals and provided laundry services for the seven
unmarried adult males), the relationship between the
74-year old mother and one son (then age 39) was
particularly disturbing. Clearly this son had been des-
ignated the "chosen child." Other members of the
family were clear in their description of this son as the
mother's favorite. While this son was now an adult,
his history revealed more than 20 years of adulthood
with at least nine consecutive romantic relationships
of short duration. The "chosen child" in this case,
along with the mother in this system, described their
relationship as one of "friends." This family expressed
no disease in volunteering that the mother took the
liberty of interceding on her son's behalf to secure a
date for her 37-year-old son. The target of the son's
affection denied the man a date, so the mother called
to find out why the woman had not wanted to go out
with her son. Neither the son, nor the mother found
anything inappropriate about this, or other similar
incidents. Interestingly, or rather, expectedly, the rela-
tionship between the father and mother in this family
was severely compromised. The father presented as a
powerful figure, answering questions for the wife and
other family members. In the father's presence
the mother was quiet and conceding. Whenever the
4 SAGE Open
"chosen child" son would enter the room, however,
the father would exit. This was a noticeable pattern
over the course of the therapy. In her son's presence
the mother clearly became more comfortable. Her
facial expressions changed, as did her demeanor and
her willingness to engage. In the son's presence, the
mother smiled frequently, responded to questions, and
even volunteered information.
Although this particular case seems to be an "over-the-
top" illustration of maternal enmeshment, it clearly demon-
strates the magnitude of the ill effects of emotionally
incestuous relationships. Love (1990) defined emotional
incest between a mother and son as maternal enmeshment
with a child to the degree that the child's sense of self is so
limited and his need for connection with his mother is so
great that the child is powerless over the relationship. In
such a relationship, according to Love, the mother keeps her
son dependent on her while paradoxically, using him to
fulfill her own emotional needs. Bradshaw (1989) termed
this unhealthy bond spousification of the child, and charac-
terized it as a blatant violation of the intimacy taboo between
parent and child. The mother, in this and related cases, is
preying on the child's admiration and unconditional love to
meet a need for which children are inadequately equipped--
marital partnership. Adult partnering requires and is contin-
gent on partners' readiness to actively engage in processes
such as intimacy formation, companionship, problem solv-
ing, ego fulfillment, and ego release. These are all tasks,
according to Forward (1989), that require at least adult lev-
els of emotional and psychological development.
Much like the case summary noted above, the "chosen
child" only notices the exclusivity of his relationship with
and his access to his mother. He enjoys the attention he
receives in the form of shared confidences, extra privileges,
praise, and affection. The emotionally incestuous relation-
ship results in its victim "mama's boy" (Love, 1990, p. 8)
having limited age-appropriate interactions with his siblings
or other peers. Consequently, he also has limited opportuni-
ties to practice being a child. This gross lack of appropriate
peer group experiences perpetuates the child's already
arrested social development. Ultimately, this child will stag-
nate in his emotional, as well as his social, development and
will tend to function primarily in reaction to others.
Although we recognize that the challenges inherent in the
emotional incest victim's adult life affects his ability to
engage on an emotional level, there is yet another component
of this person's adult relationship that may also suffer.
Adams's (2011) insights into the depths of such a pathologi-
cal bond speak to the emotional unavailability of emotional
incest victims in their adult sexual relationships. One may be
inclined to ask, in all sincerity, how it is that emotional incest
gets in the way of its victim's adulthood sexual expressions.
Because victims of emotional incest carry their intense needs
into their adult relationships, according to Adams, it is not
uncommon that they marry their emotionally abusive par-
ents. It stands to reason, then, that these adults (both the vic-
tim and his like-minded spouse) are ill equipped for healthy
adult relationships in several life domains. Their emotional
intimacy with their spouses will be compromised, as will be
their ability for healthy sexual expression.
According to Adams (2011), the emotional incest victim's
adult sexual relationship is commonly marked by lack of pas-
sion at one end of the spectrum or volatility at the other.
Ultimately, what is notably consistent in the sexual expres-
sion of the maternally enmeshed adult male is the need for
escape, rather than connection (Adams & Morgan, 2007).
Adams and Morgan (2007) explained that the maternally
enmeshed adult male struggles to remain loyal to the role to
which he has been assigned by his mother. This role, mind
you, is not one of a fully individuated adult who is aware of,
and can fully express a range of feelings. This definition
ascribed by the abuser is one whereby the victim is constantly
in need of someone else's opinion to determine his own
worth. Erotic engagement for this person, then, lacks the
depth of give-and-take reminiscent of healthy exchange, and
is, rather, more like a performance for which he is to be rated.
Maternal FactorsThat Contribute to
Enmeshment
Most practitioners would agree to our human need for com-
panionship. Bradshaw (1989) described our partnering in
adulthood as the system's need for a (good) marriage.
Having someone with whom to share intimacies (emotion-
ally as well as physically) is a need that seems to transcends
species, even. Jane Goodall's famous research on chimpan-
zee's, for example, left little doubt in our minds regarding
the stark similarities between humans and simians in our
attachments to our children. "Flo," the maternal figure in
one of Goodall's research units, demonstrated variable
degrees of attachment with her own (chimpanzee) children,
much like would be seen in human maternal relationships.
Interestingly, Flo developed an unhealthy attachment with
one of her male children, Flint. A catalyst for this enmeshed
relationship, it seems, may have been Flo's own compro-
mised functioning secondary to the loss of another of her
children (Johnson, 1996). Johnson (1996) proposed that
Flo's resolve to impose the "opposing force" (Kerr, 1988)
that encourages independence in children may have been
weakened by her grief. While Flint's demands for his moth-
er's attention may have been manageable under not so
stressful circumstances, in the face of grief, however, these
same demands may have become overwhelming for the
mother. However, Johnson contended, allowing Flint to con-
tinue to be dependent undoubtedly provided Flo opportuni-
ties to "mother" the lost child. In other words, Flint became
a substitute for the lost child.
Although maternity is seen as a compassionate endeavor,
we tend to equate it with a certain level of gentility; benign,
Hann-Morrison 5
and certainly absent of the malice one associates with such
terms as incest. Who among us, one may then ask, would
inflict such an injustice on her own child? Research shows
that the mother who spousifies her son is not necessarily an
enigma (Bradshaw, 1989; Kinnier et al., 1990; Manzi et al.,
2006). Manzi et al. (2006) concurred with the previous find-
ings of Love (1990), Bradshaw (1989), and Forward (1989)
that enmeshed mothers usually do not know the difference
between parenting and partnering. These women, they say,
are not knowledgeable about the emotional needs of chil-
dren. They all assert, further, though, that among the primary
liabilities of enmeshed mothers are their lack of role models
and their own unresolved emotional issues.
As inferred earlier in the contribution, the primary train-
ing ground for child rearing is one's own family of origin.
The behaviors of our parents and significant extended family
members are usually our only lessons in mothering or father-
ing. Consequently, their parenting becomes our parenting.
Habits, ideologies, and philosophies are then transmitted
generationally. It is no wonder, then, that women who engage
in emotionally incestuous relationships with their sons are
generally, themselves, the products of dysfunctional fami-
lies. Emotionally incestuous mothers are generally looking
to their sons to fulfill a need that has gone unmet long before
adulthood. Furthermore, they, too, are so stunted in their
emotional development, that they feel compelled to seek out
need fulfillment in the most convenient manner, and from
the most convenient source, their children (Bradshaw, 1989).
Theorists also point out the parenting fallacies portrayed
by television families as contributing to the notion of wom-
en's maternal responsibilities (Love, 1990; Manzi et al.,
2006). June Cleaver, for example, seemed immersed in the
goings-on of Wally and The Beaver, while placing little
emphasis on her own circle of friends or on her relationship
with her husband. Even more contemporary media portray-
als of maternity offer up the continually self-sacrificing
divorced mom as the epitome of morally correct parenting.
Contemporary media provided us with such extreme cases
of mothering as Marie Baron ("Everybody Loves
Raymond"), as an indication of how not to mother. Even
the nonpractitioner could readily see the profound pathol-
ogy in this fictional family's reactions to one another and
an over-the-top manipulating mother. The symptoms of
maternal enmeshment may not be so readily observable as
what is noted in the Baron family.
While 21st-century TV mothers Rosanne Connor and
Reba Hart hailed from opposite sides of the economic and
social tracks, they both, like their predecessors, provided the
world with images of women so invested in their children's
lives that they neglected their own needs. These kinds of
messages, say systems theorists and practitioners, impose
exacting demands on mothers regarding what their primary
responsibilities should be. Such messages and messengers,
of course, in conjunction with family members' modeling
place marriage and other significant relationships in a posi-
tion secondary to that of mothering (Bradshaw, 1988a,
1988b; Hann-Morrison, 2006; Love, 1990).
Women who are enmeshed with their sons were consis-
tently found to lack self-definition as well as healthy adult
companionship (Love, 1990; Manzi et al., 2006). Expect the
enmeshed mother, say researchers (Gavazzi, Anderson, &
Sabatelli, 1993; Manzi et al., 2006; Parker, 1995), to be the
one whose relationships with other adults are either nonexis-
tent or severely limited. She may be a single parent, they say,
by divorce or by choice. She may also be married but to an
emotionally absent husband. Bradshaw (1988a, 1988b) and
Love (1990) noted that in the case of the married woman who
is in an enmeshed relationship with her child, although her
husband may be physically present, he is not actively engaged
in the role of a spouse, at least not at an emotional level. The
void left by the physically or emotionally absent husband is
then expected to be filled by the son (Schwartzman, 2006).
Although subsystems are independently functioning
units, the adaptive operations of the family system are con-
tingent on the (adaptive) interdependence of each subsystem
with and among other subsystems (Minuchin, 1974). Each
subsystem has a role to fulfill in ensuring the continuation of
the system as a whole unit. Because of the dynamic relation-
ships between and among subsystems, breaches in the func-
tioning of one subsystem will adversely affect the ability of
the other systems to function adaptively. A member in one
subsystem may blur boundaries, however, in encroaching on
members of another subsystem to have his or her's needs
met. When a "marriage" does not exist in its traditional terms
and between two adults, it is not uncommon for a wife whose
emotional needs are not being met to encroach on an avail-
able son to act in a spousal capacity (Dickstein, Seifer,Albus,
& Magee, 2004).
Another common liability noted in enmeshed mothers
involve a spectrum of issues related to these women's own
emotional or mental stability. Love (1990), Bradshaw
(1988a, 1988b), and Forward (1989) noted emotional insta-
bility and affective dysfunctioning to be characteristic of
enmeshed mothers. Depression, they say, seems to be a
major contributing factor in maternally enmeshed relation-
ships more often than not. The phenomena, they contend,
seems to be more common in women with chronic depres-
sion, and whose need for support may be overwhelming.
Dickstein et al. (2004) noted that families with depressed
mothers are related to increased levels of impaired
functioning. Mothers with depression, it seems, tend to rely
on their adolescents and adult children for support, and
tend, further, to exhibit a broad array of dysfunctions in the
area of affective functioning (Dickstein et al., 2004).
Dickstein et al. report, interestingly, that while depressed
women with infants tend to be disengaged from their infant
children, they tend, conversely, to attach intensely to their
adolescent and adult children. As their children age, it
6 SAGE Open
seems, these women impose increasing demands on the
children for intimacy and social support.
The Social Fallout
According to Schwartzman (2006), compromises in the
interaction regulation between mothers and sons are more
common than those between mothers and daughters. Lindsey,
MacKinnon-Lewis, Campbell, Frabutt, and Lamb (2002)
offered similar findings, noting that boys are more at risk for
negative effects of parenting on social outcomes. According
to Schwartzman and Lindsey et al., while enmeshment by
mothers may plague the mother­daughter relationship, the
mother­son relationship seems to be more vulnerable to
maternal enmeshment.
As the "chosen child" (Love, 1990, p. 8), the boy who
has found himself in his mother's continual graces usually
finds the special privileges and extra attention he receives
from his mother gratifying. The ultimate toll on the child,
however, will be nothing less than life altering. Levying the
adult responsibilities of emotional nurturance for one's par-
ent on the shoulders of a child compromises the child's
development in several crucial domains. Love (1990) pur-
ported that as lofty a position as being the "chosen child"
may seem, the victim of maternal enmeshment is precisely
that--a victim. In exchange for his service to his mother,
this child actually relinquishes his entire life. According to
Anderson and Sabatelli (1992), this child loses out on
opportunities to interact socially with peers, and ultimately
loses out on his childhood. This loss of childhood, they
offer, has a downwardly spiraling effect. In addition to ren-
dering the child unfit for adaptive peer interactions, the
unhealthy mother­son relationship also has the cumulative
effect of decreased opportunities for adaptive adolescent
interactions, and therefore limited opportunities to practice
assuming adult roles. Gavazzi et al. (1993) believed that
because the chosen child misses out on the socialization
inherent in peer contact, he consequently does not develop
emotionally or socially. His repertoire of responses, they
contend, ends up being emotionally primitive and socially
immature for his age. The chosen child reacts to his mother
and she reacts to him. The reaction becomes generalized to
the whole family, and this child becomes the crusader, so to
speak, for maintaining the status quo. This reactivity leads
to deepening of the fusion between mother and son, as the
child is being programmed to have similar values and tastes
as his mother.
Most family systems theorists find that the chosen child is
isolated in childhood, and continues to be isolated in his
adult life. They find, further, that as an adult, this person's
interactions with peers continue to be limited. As a product
of limited opportunities to interact with his peers, the chosen
child is rendered, in essence, grossly limited as an adult
(Bradshaw, 1988a, 1988b; Love, 1990; Manzi et al., 2006).
According to Love (1990), chosen child grows up being
unsure of what is acceptable or peer appropriate behaviors
and what isn't. In addition, as said by Love, as an adult, the
victim of maternal enmeshment tends to be perfectionistic,
and has a compulsive need to succeed. He will overcompen-
sate in his efforts to appear at least normal. According to
Love and Schwartzman (2006), because the chosen child has
been in the spotlight of his mother's life for most, if not all,
of his own life, he believes himself to be superior. They both
contend that it is not uncommon for this person to develop
narcissistic traits, if not full-blown narcissism. This sense of
superiority may manifest itself in extreme efforts at outdoing
peers in his professional life. He wants to earn more money
than . . .; garner greater recognition than . . . .
Despite his tendency to over function in his interpersonal
relationships, this will be one area where the "chosen child"
will probably experience the greatest frustration (Williams
& Hiebert, 2001). Here, the narcissist becomes very
dismissing of others' feelings and seek out interpersonal
relationships that serve his own needs for superiority.
Needless to say, men who have been enmeshed with their
mothers find it difficult to sustain meaningful interpersonal
relationships with peers. Generally over a short period of
time, the relationships will fizzle out for at least one of two
common reasons--The chosen child will find another target
to support his sense of superiority; or the mate of the chosen
child will eventually come to recognize the futility of a rela-
tionship in which her partner over functions to promote
maintenance of the status quo, as opposed to engaging in an
adaptive exercise of emotional give and take that defines
marriage. Realistically, any effort at a healthy relationship
with the chosen child is doomed from the very start, as these
men fear intimacy and commitment (Forward, 1989; Love,
1990). Bradshaw (1988a, 1988b), Love (1990), and Parker
(1995) relayed accounts of their own clients who have
themselves been their mothers' chosen children. The gen-
eral consensus, it seems, is that these men have a difficult
time understanding the concept of freedom within interper-
sonal relationships. Reportedly, these men also tend to view
close relationships as invasive. These same authors purport
that the likelihood of marriage for the male chosen child is
slim. Marriage quality, according to Dickstein et al. (2004),
is intimately linked with the quality of functioning in other
aspects of life. It stands to reason, then, that the likelihood
of a healthy, adaptive marriage for these men might be
somewhere close to nil. Although male victims of maternal
enmeshment do marry, the results, reportedly, are usually
disasterous (Bradshaw, 1988a, 1988b; Schwartzman, 2006).
The life transition inherent in what we define marriage to
be would pose a significant threat to the chosen child's iden-
tity. The maternally enmeshed son is likely to be challenged
by a role that implies a degree of equality, and therefore a
renegotiation of his position in the family system
(Schwartzman, 2006). As the chosen child is accustomed to
Hann-Morrison 7
being the center of his mother's attention, and has very little,
if any, experience with equality, he naturally assumes center
stage in the marital relationship. Remember, he is a narcis-
sist, and will not tolerate being upstaged. His choice for a
spouse, likely, will be someone to whom he feels he is superior
in the first place. This person will dominate the marital rela-
tionship, and will adhere vehemently to the family mythology
of his inherent loftiness. Furthermore, he will adamantly deny
any dysfunction in himself personally or in his family system.
Should the chosen child's spouse resist or in any way chal-
lenge her husband's maladaptive level of functioning, the cho-
sen child will usually pit his mother against his wife. This,
according to Bradshaw (1989), is yet another incident of
immature reactivity. As the ensuing drama between wife and
mother unfolds, the wife typically becomes the outlaw, and a
divorce is the end product (Love, 1990).
Despite the tendency for abject failure at interpersonal
relationships, there is evidence to suggest that even the
maternally enmeshed child may, with personal and commit-
ted effort on his part and support from significant agents of
change, develop and sustain adaptive adult interpersonal
relationships. Dickstein et al. (2004) offered, for example,
that the presence and active participation of a secure and
adaptively functioning partner/spouse may serve to offset the
effects of negative childhood relational experiences.
TheTherapeutic Setting
In considering offering therapeutic intervention to emanci-
pate the maternally enmeshed man, one must understand
that the enmeshed relationship between mother and son is
the product of bilateral interactions of need. Schwartzman
(2006), Dickstein et al. (2004), as well as family systems
theorist over the span of decades have recognized that the
enmeshed relationship is a co-construction between both
parties (Bradshaw, 1988a, 1988b; Love, 1990). Both par-
ties, they offer, contribute to the relationship's continuation.
Although one might subsume, then, that emancipation of
the chosen child from the maladaptive grips of his enmeshed
mother requires both parties, the fact is that emancipation
is rarely the goal of both parties involved in such a relation-
ship (Schwartzman, 2006). Schwartzman offer that gener-
ally it is the chosen child who seeks to heal the relationship
between he and an overpowering mother. The catalyst for
the chosen child to seek assistance is usually chronic anxi-
ety, depression, and an undeniable pattern of unhealthy and
emotionally unrewarding interpersonal relationships (Love,
1990; Schwartzman, 2006).
Although it is possible for the chosen child to be emanci-
pated from his enmeshed mother, or from the undifferenti-
ated ego mass that is his family, more often than not the only
emancipation that occurs is the chosen child from a wife who
has grown weary of the family fusion. For the chosen child,
emancipation requires great effort--often more effort than
this person is willing to invest, or can muster. Emancipation
requires acknowledgment that the enmeshed relationship is
unhealthy. As the chosen child has adopted similar values as
the doting mother, it is unlikely that he will see the maternal
relationship as a contributing factor in his inability to secure
and maintain healthy adult functioning. Moreover, seeking
emancipation means being dethroned--This translates into
losing a position of power and prestige in the family to
become "ordinary."
Growth from this arrested place of social and emotional
stagnation requires the victim of maternal enmeshment to
challenge long-held and deeply ingrained beliefs, not only
about himself but also more importantly about the system
from which he comes. The reconceptualization of the system
as broken usually requires insight from a source or sources
that the chosen child deems credible.
The hallmarks of treatment for the maternally enmeshed
son, then, are sure to include intensive education on
enmeshment. These include teaching clients about the char-
acteristics within systems that indicate or are related to the
development and sustenance of maladaptive interactions
among members. The client must be able to apply these
concepts to his own relationship and be made to connect his
unhealthy relationship with his mother to his unhealthy
relationships with peers.
Conclusion
A family is typically thought of as that cohesive unit with
which one has so much in common, but that simultaneously
affords individuals the freedom to also exercise personal dif-
ferences. We reasonably expect our families to be the pri-
mary source of nurturance and support and to facilitate
emotional, physical, mental, and social growth. Gavazzi
et al. (1993) offered that among parents' greatest gifts to
their children are the provision of opportunities for experi-
mentation with a variety of responsibilities, while providing
the children support and coaching. These opportunities, they
contend, serve to create a context of emotional bonding and
acceptance of personal boundaries.
Although families generally provide rather adequately for
our physical and emotional needs, some simply fall misera-
bly short of allowing members to become individuals. While
one family may be quite able to afford members opportuni-
ties for personal development, another may present as totally
inadequate due to its own multigenerational emotional and
mental inadequacies. Parenting is, without question, among
the most challenging of responsibilities, and yet, it is among
the few for which there is no formal training. The primary
source of our lessons in parenting is the models provided in
our homes, with some unfortunate input from the fictitious
character portrayals in the media. It is no wonder, then, that
patterns of maladaptive family relationships are seen across
generations.
8 SAGE Open
In a society as enlightened as ours, abuse of a child is
never an acceptable option, and as a society, we have banned
together to collaboratively take up the cause of victims of
both sexual and physical abuse. The emotional residues of
both childhood sexual and physical abuse are readily observ-
able in victims who struggle to form adaptive relationships
in adulthood. For the child who is thrust into the adult role of
providing for his mother's emotional needs, we are not so
quick to call foul. Sadly, and without society ever really
noticing, these children lose ground emotionally, mentally,
and psychologically. They lose out on the opportunities of
childhood, and consequently struggle with adulthood.
Because they have had such limited opportunities to learn
what are peer appropriate behaviors, they typically suffer
lasting delays in their own social and emotional develop-
ment. These delays are telling in these adults' clumsy
attempts at meaningful interpersonal engagement with peers.
Reasonably, then, victims of maternal enmeshment will be
challenged to form families that function within the param-
eters of what may be considered normal. For this, along with
a multitude of other reasons, emotionally impaired relation-
ships between mothers and their sons require intense thera-
peutic attention.
