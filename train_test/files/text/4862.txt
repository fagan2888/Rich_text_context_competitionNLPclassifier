Abstract
Objectives: To investigate the effect of recombinant human luteinizing hormone supplementation
(rLH priming) during the early follicular phase on in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI) outcomes.
Methods: In order to evaluate available evidence regarding the efficacy of rLH priming in IVF/ICSI
procedures, a systematic review and meta-analysis was preformed. Searches were conducted on
MEDLINEÕ, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Clinical Trials without language limitation, but
were restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Results: Three RCTs including 346 patients were included in this meta-analysis, which
demonstrated that rLH priming did not increase ongoing pregnancy rate. Although less
recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) was required and the oestradiol level was
higher on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin administration in the rLH priming group, the
numbers of oocytes retrieved and embryos produced were comparable between patients treated
with rLH priming and those treated with rFSH alone.
Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis has demonstrated that at present there is
insufficient evidence that patients undergoing IVF/ICSI may benefit from rLH priming during the
early follicular phase.

Introduction
According to the two-cell, two-gonadotro-
phin theory, both follicle-stimulating hor-
mone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)
are important for follicle development in
humans. FSH plays a crucial role in recruit-
ment, selection and dominance; LH acts
through the middle-to-late follicular phase
by contributing to dominance maturation
and ovulation. Meanwhile, LH promotes
the biosynthesis of androgens, which are the
substrate for oestradiol (E2
).1,2
The effect of LH supplementation on
in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes has
been evaluated in several areas. For exam-
ple, in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH) agonist protocol, because of pitu-
itary desensitization, endogenous levels of
LH are very low during the late stimulation
phase.3 What is more, around 50% of
patients undergoing IVF/intracytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI) using GnRH agonist
are LH deficient.3 Thus, it would seem
logical that LH supplementation would be
beneficial to IVF/ICSI results. However,
whether LH supplementation during the
late follicular phase can increase the preg-
nancy and implantation rates or decrease the
spontaneous abortion rate is still a subject
for debate.4­7
In contrast, the effect of LH supplemen-
tation on IVF outcomes for patients who
show a suboptimal response to FSH has also
been evaluated by many investigators.8,9
Even though it is still unclear exactly how
LH supplementation affects follicular devel-
opment, a growing amount of evidence
demonstrating the beneficial effect of LH
supplementation in patients who show sub-
optimal response to FSH has been pub-
lished.8,9 Studies have shown that LH
supplementation not only improves
embryo quality but also increases the
pregnancy rate in women with poor ovarian
reserve.8­10
Several studies have been conducted to
assess the role of LH supplementation in the
early phase of follicular growth.11­13 It has
been shown that LH might increase granu-
losa cell FSH sensitivity by increasing
androgen synthesis during the early stage
of folliculogenesis. However, because of
relatively small sample sizes, these studies
were underpowered for pregnancy rate as a
primary outcome and were inconclusive as
to the benefit of recombinant LH (rLH)
priming in patients undergoing IVF/
ICSI.11­13
The aim of this systematic review and
meta-analysis was to summarize the existing
evidence on the effect of rLH priming during
the early follicular phase on IVF/ICSI
outcomes.
Materials and methods
Literature search
Literature searches were conducted to
retrieve randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) on the effect of early follicular
phase rLH supplementation in patients
undergoing IVF with normal ovary reserva-
tion on IVF/ICSI outcome. MEDLINEÕ,
EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of
Clinical Trials were searched up to May
2013 using the following search strategy:
(`recombinant luteinizing hormone' or
`luveris' or `lutropin alfa' or `recombinant
rLH' or `rLH') AND (`recombinant follicle
stimulation hormone' or `rFSH' or `recom-
binant FSH' or `rhFSH') AND (`assisted
reproductive techniques' or `ART' or `IVF'
or `ICSI' or `in vitro fertilization' or `intra-
cytoplasmic sperm injections'). The searches
were not limited by language, but restricted
to RCTs. A combination of text words and
262 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
specific database indexing terminology were
used to search available RCTs.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria were RCTs that compared
the effect of rLH priming in the early
follicular phase on IVF/ICSI outcomes and
ovarian stimulation parameters. Exclusion
criteria included failure to report appropri-
ate randomization procedures, participants
as poor responders, or early follicular phase
LH priming with other agents (e.g. human
chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], dehydroe-
piandrosterone, letrozole or human meno-
pausal gonadotropin [hMG]).
Data collection
Studies were screened by two reviewers (Z.B.
and L.H.) independently and there were no
disagreements in the studies identified for
inclusion. First, all titles and abstracts from
the databases were examined, but only those
with the possibility of meeting the prede-
fined criteria were kept for further evalu-
ation. Secondly, final inclusion decisions
were made on examination of the full
manuscripts. If the published study was
judged to contain insufficient information,
study authors were contacted. The primary
outcome was ongoing pregnancy rate.
Secondary outcomes included the number
of oocytes retrieved, recombinant FSH
(rFSH) dosage, E2
level on the day of hCG
administration and number of embryos
produced.
Data synthesis and analysis
All data extracted were combined for meta-
analysis using RevMan version 5.0 software
(Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK).
Dichotomous data for each unit of analysis
were expressed as an odds ratio (OR) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs). Continuous
variables were expressed as weighted mean
difference (WMD) with 95% CIs.
Heterogeneity was evaluated using the
Q-test and I2-index values, and reported
for each outcome as a P-value and percent-
age, respectively. Data from the studies were
combined using a fixed-effects model when
heterogeneity was negligible, or a random-
effects model when significant heterogeneity
existed. A P-value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
The process of literature identification and
selection is summarized in Figure 1. A total
of 367 citations were identified; 36 full text
articles were reviewed in detail, and of these,
five RCTs were considered eligible for inclu-
sion.11­15 Of these five studies, one study
examined whether exogenous LH adminis-
tration during the early follicular phase had
a beneficial effect on the IVF outcomes.15
However, the ovarian stimulation protocol
in the study group started with 1 ampule of
hMG (75 IU FSH þ 75 IU LH activity) daily
for 4 days, with simultaneous administra-
tion of rFSH.15 Another study assessed the
effect of short-term pre-rFSH administra-
tion of LH in women entering an ICSI cycle
on follicular development, oocyte quality
and early embryo development.14 LH prim-
ing was achieved by 7 days' administration
of 200 IU/day hCG when ovarian suppres-
sion had occurred.14 Therefore, these two
trials were excluded because the aim of this
study was to explore the effect of rLH
priming on IVF/ICSI outcomes.
Three studies were considered eligible for
inclusion in this meta-analysis, which
included 346 patients undergoing IVF/ICSI
with or without rLH priming.11­13 In these
three studies, all patients were treated with
the standard long protocol. Pituitary desen-
sitization was achieved by using GnRH-a
(depot tryptorelin, buserelin or short-acting
triptorelin) to inhibit a premature LH surge.
Hu et al. 263
All three trials with a total of 325 women
provided data on the ongoing pregnancy
rates (note that not all 346 women included
in the studies were able to undergo embryo
transfer). The ongoing pregnancy rate
varied between 25.3% and 44.0% in the
rLH priming group and between 18.7% and
37.1% in the control group (Figure 2).11­13
All three RCTs showed a higher ongoing
pregnancy rate in women treated with rLH
priming compared with those treated with
rFSH alone. However, the pooled analysis
with these three trials did not show differ-
ences between rLH priming and the control
groups (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.46, 1.21;
I2 ¼ 0%).
Meta-analysis of the three trials that
reported the number of oocytes retrieved
as an outcome showed no significant differ-
ence between women treated with rLH
priming compared with the control group
(WMD À0.33; 95% CI À2.43, 1.77;
Figure 3).11­13 Durnerin et al.11 reported a
higher oocyte yield in the rLH priming
group (10.8 versus 9.2) and Kovacs et al.12
also reported a higher oocyte yield in the
rLH priming group (10.2 versus 9.0), but the
differences were not significant. However,
the remaining study showed a significantly
lower oocyte yield in the rLH priming group
(6.2 versus 7.4; P < 0.05).13 There was het-
erogeneity in this comparison (I2 ¼ 75%,
Pheterogeneity
< 0.05). Data were combined
using a random-effects model.
Only two RCTs with a total of 200
patients that reported on the dosage of
rFSH used in ovarian stimulation.12,13
Meta-analysis of these two RCTs showed
that the total dosage of rFSH used was
significantly lower in those with rLH prim-
ing, compared with those treated with
rFSH alone (WMD 169.45; 95% CI 9.10,

eity was suggested by the results of the Q-
test and the I2-index.
Two RCTs with a total of 200 patients
reported data for E2
level on the day of hCG
administration.12,13 The pooled analysis of
these two RCTs showed a significantly
higher E2
level in the rLH priming group
compared with the control group (WMD
À381.4; 95% CI À612.58, ­150.22;
Figure 5). Heterogeneity tests were non-
significant (I2 ¼ 0%), indicating that there
was no statistical inconsistency between
these two studies.
All three RCTs reported on the number
of embryos produced as an outcome.11­13
The random-effects model showed no sig-
nificant difference between those treated
with rLH priming, compared with those
treated with rFSH alone (WMD À0.42;
95% CI À1.71, 0.87; Figure 6). There was
heterogeneity in this comparison (I2 ¼ 66%,
Pheterogeneity
¼ 0.05).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of rLH
priming during the early follicular phase for
IVF/ICSI outcomes. According to the
results of the present meta-analysis, women
undergoing IVF/ICSI using a GnRH agon-
ist protocol with rLH priming appear to
have similar outcomes compared those
treated with rFSH alone.

Both FSH and LH play an important role
in folliculogenesis. FSH stimulates growth
and recruitment of immature follicles in the
ovary. In the early follicular phase, FSH is
the major survival factor that rescues the
small antral follicles (2­5 mm in diameter for
humans) from apoptosis. LH, which is well
known for its importance in the late follicu-
lar phase, supports theca cells in the ovaries
that provide androgens and hormonal pre-
cursors for oestradiol production.16,17 Thus,
in the process of IVF, to imitate the changes

of FSH and LH in natural folliculogenesis,
rLH or hMG are usually added in the late
follicular phase during ovarian stimulation.
Although controversy remains about the
efficacy of this procedure, LH supplementa-
tion during the late follicular phase is
employed worldwide to help follicles reach
maturation.
Most of the studies concerning the effect
of LH supplementation on IVF outcomes
were designed to administer LH in the late
follicular phase or in patients who showed a
suboptimal response to FSH.9,10 However,
little is known about the role of LH in the
early follicular stage. The complex roles
played by FSH, LH and other hormones
during folliculogenesis have become better
understood. High LH and androgen con-
centrations, which used to be considered as
indicators of less healthy follicles in the early
follicular phase, are now found to have a
positive effect on granulosa cell activity of
smaller follicles.18 LH not only promotes the
growth of larger follicles, but also increases
granulosa cell FSH activity by increasing
androgen synthesis.19 In addition, it is
known that the cytoplasmic maturational
process is controlled by E2
.19 Since LH is
also responsible for the production of
androgen precursors by theca cells, which
are required for E2
biosynthesis, LH is
crucial for the process of oocyte matur-
ation.19 Therefore, it is reasonable to
hypothesize that if rLH is administered in
the early follicular phase before ovarian
stimulation, in women undergoing IVF/
ICSI with the GnRH agonist protocol, (i)
more follicles might be recruited, less rFSH
may be required and more oocytes may be
retrieved, since LH has a synergistic effect
with FSH in follicular recruitment and
granulosa cell proliferation; (ii) oocyte qual-
ity might be increased, which leads to an
increased yield of viable embryos and even a
higher pregnancy rate.
Indeed, according to the results of the
present meta-analysis, patients treated with
rLH priming needed less rFSH to achieve
oocyte maturation and tended to yield
more oocytes, compared with those treated
with rFSH alone. However, it must also be
borne in mind that patients treated with
rLH priming needed more LH compared
with control patients. Meanwhile, the
number of embryos was comparable
between these two groups, even though
the peak E2
level was significantly higher in
the rLH priming group. All of these results
were consistent with our hypothesis.
However, all three RCTs observed a
higher pregnancy rate in the rLH priming
group, but the differences were not statis-
tically significant.
The validity and interpretation of a
meta-analysis mainly depends on the qual-
ity and homogeneity of the included stu-
dies. Therefore, only RCTs with LH
priming using rLH were included into
this study. However, it is acknowledged
that this systematic review and meta-ana-
lysis has several potential limitations. First,
there was clinical and methodological het-
erogeneity between the three included
RCTs. Durnerin et al.11 used depot
GnRH agonist for pituitary downregula-
tion and a dose of 300 IU/day of rLH for 7
days of priming, whereas the other two
studies used daily GnRH agonist down-
regulation and 75 IU/day of rLH for 4
days of priming.12,13 It cannot be excluded
that these clinical variations might be
associated with the effectiveness or not of
rLH priming. Another problem encoun-
tered in this meta-analysis was that the
total number of RCTs included was rela-
tively small. Although no heterogeneity
was observed in the analysis of ongoing
pregnancy rate, rFSH dosage and E2
level
on the day of hCG administration, there
was significant heterogeneity in the analysis
of the number of oocytes retrieved and the
number of embryos produced. In addition,
given the small sample sizes, the CIs for
some of the outcomes were extremely wide.
Hu et al. 267
Meanwhile, due to the limited number of
studies included in this meta-analysis, it
was not possible to perform funnel plots to
examine publication bias, undertake sub-
group analyses and meta-regression
analyses.
In conclusion, based on the best available
evidence, this systematic review and meta-
analysis found that there is insufficient evi-
dence that patients undergoing IVF/ICSI
may benefit from rLH priming during the
early follicular phase. However, because of
the limited number of RCTs included in this
study, larger well-designed RCTs are needed
to determine whether rLH priming is bene-
ficial to IVF/ICSI outcomes.
