OBJECTIVE -- To determine whether impaired pulmonary function is a significant predictor
of the incidence of diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Using data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study, a cohort study of a representa-
tive sample of U.S. adults, we examined the prospective associations between pulmonary func-
tion and incidence of diabetes. Our analyses included 4,830 U.S. men and women aged 25­74
years who had a baseline interview and examination (including spirometry) from 1971 through
1975 and were followed through 1992­1993. Incident diabetes (n  443) was based on self- or
proxy reports, hospitalization, or death certificates.
RESULTS -- After multiple adjustment, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1
), forced vital
capacity (FVC), percentage of predicted FEV1
, and percentage of predicted FVC were signifi-
cantly and inversely associated with the incidence of diabetes, but the ratio of FEV1
to FVC was
not. Obstructive lung disease (defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung
Disease classification) was not significantly associated with the incidence of diabetes, but restric-
tive lung disease was (hazard ratio  1.45, 95% CI 1.04­2.03). The association did not differ
significantly by smoking status.
CONCLUSIONS -- Although several prospective studies have found that impaired pulmo-
nary function may increase the risk for developing diabetes, additional research is needed to
better understand these relationships and their possible implications.

Lung function may predict the devel-
opment of insulin resistance or dia-
betes (1­4). In the Normative Aging
Study (2), forced vital capacity (FVC),
forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1
),
and maximal mid-expiratory flow rate
(MMEF) were associated with insulin re-
sistance over a period of 20.9 years. In ad-
dition, three Swedish studies with follow-
ups of 6­13.9 years found that impaired
lung function predicted the development of
diabetes(1,3,4).Inallthreestudies,lowlev-
els of FVC were associated with increased
risk; in one, FEV1
was inversely associated
with incidence.
To provide another perspective on
the possible association between lung
function and incidence of diabetes, we an-
alyzed data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemio-
logic Follow-Up Study (NHEFS), a cohort
study. We studied possible prospective
associations between measures of pulmo-
nary function, including FEV1
, FVC, per-
centage of predicted FEV1
, percentage of
predicted FVC, and the ratio of FEV1
to
FVC, and incidence of diabetes. In addi-
tion, we examined the association be-
tween different forms of lung disease--
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as
classified by the Global Initiative for
Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
(GOLD), restrictive lung disease, and re-
spiratory symptoms--and the incidence
of diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- In 1971­1975, a repre-
sentative sample of the U.S. civilian pop-
ulation received a baseline examination
and interview as part of the first National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES I). The sample was selected us-
ing a complex sampling design so that re-
sults would be representative of the
noninstitutionalized civilian population.
Participants aged 25­74 years (n 
14,407) were followed up through 1992­
1993 and thus became part of the NHEFS.
Details of the NHANES I and the NHEFS
are available elsewhere (5­11).
During the follow-up study, up to
four attempts were made to contact par-
ticipants or their surrogates in person
and, during later follow-ups, by tele-
phone as well; this occurred in 1982­
1984, 1986 (only participants aged 55
years), 1987, and 1992­1993. Permis-
sion was requested to obtain hospital
records. Deaths were identified through
searches of the National Death Index, en-
rollee files of the Health Care Financing
Administration, and other tracing mech-
anisms. A participant was considered de-
ceased only if a death certificate had been
received or a proxy interview had been

completed to verify the death. Death cer-
tificates have been obtained for 97% of
participants who died through 1993.
Participants had incident diabetes if
1) during any of the four follow-up con-
tacts, they reported that they had ever
been told by a doctor that they had diabe-
tes; 2) a hospitalization record listed the
ICD-9-CM code 250 as any 1 of 10 diag-
noses on the hospital discharge sheet; or
3) the death certificate included the
ICD-9 code 250. Participants who re-
ported that they had diabetes were asked
the year of disease onset. The midpoint of
that year was designated as the date of
onset. For participants who did not report
a year of onset, we assigned the midpoint
between the last date of known contact
and the date of the most recent interview.
The date of onset was chosen as the date
the condition was first reported or re-
corded on institutional records or death
certificates.
Participants who reported at baseline
that they had diabetes were considered
prevalent cases, as were participants who
during later follow-up contacts reported a
date of onset that occurred in the year of
their baseline interview or earlier, and
they were excluded from the analyses.
The pulmonary symptoms included
in the analysis, which were used to define
an asymptomatic subset of the population
to calculate equations for lung function
and define a subset of the cohort with
only respiratory symptoms, were cough
(defined as a positive response to "Have
you ever had a cough first thing in the
morning in the winter?" or "Have you ever
had a cough first thing in the morning in
the summer?"), sputum (defined as a pos-
itive response to "Have you ever had any
phlegm from your chest first thing in the
morning in the winter?" or "Have you ever
had any phlegm from your chest first
thing in the morning in the summer?"),
and wheeze (defined as a positive re-
sponse to "Have you ever had wheezy or
whistling sounds in your chest?").
Spirometry was obtained by using an
Ohio Medical Instruments 800 spirome-
ter. The procedures used have been doc-
umented previously (6). Individuals were
excluded from this analysis if they either
did not perform spirometry or had results
that were not reliable. We included data
from participants who did not have "re-
producible" measures (12). (To be repro-
ducible the FEV1
and FVC from two
reliable measurements had to be within
5% for most participants.) Values used in
this analysis included the FVC, FEV1
, and
the FEV1
-to-FVC ratio. We determined
predicted values of FEV1
and FVC by per-
forming linear regression (stratified by sex
and by using age and height as predictors)
on a subgroup of participants who were
white never smokers who did not report
respiratory symptoms or physician-
diagnosed lung disease. The results from
these regression models (men: FEV1

4.3806  age  0.031767  height 
0.13827, r2  0.626, and FVC 
7.49837  age  0.03071  height 
0.19794, r2  0.589; women: FEV1

0.75683  age  0.02475  height 
0.07131, r2  0.539, and FVC 
2.2086  age  0.02394  height 
0.10381, r2  0.451) were applied to the
data from all participants to obtain pre-
dicted values of FEV1
and FVC. We used
an adjustment factor of 0.88 to estimate
predicted values for African-American
participants.
Using the percentage of predicted
FEV1
, percentage of predicted FVC, the
FEV1
-to-FVC ratio, and the presence of
respiratory symptoms, we used a modifi-
cation of the GOLD criteria to classify par-
ticipants as having chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). Participants
had mild COPD if they had a FEV1
-to-
FVC ratio 0.70 and a percentage of pre-
dicted FEV1
80%). Because too few
participants had severe or very severe
COPD, we combined them and partici-
pants who had moderate COPD into a
single group (FEV1
-to-FVC ratio 0.70
and percentage of predicted FEV1
80%). In addition, we assigned partici-
pants as having restrictive lung disease
(RLD) (FEV1
-to-FVC ratio 0.70 and
FVC 80% predicted), symptoms only
(presence of respiratory symptoms in the
absence of any lung function abnormal-
ity), and no lung disease. As per GOLD
criteria, we assigned participants who met
the criteria for having both COPD and
RLD to the COPD group.
Covariates included age, race or eth-
nicity (nonwhite or white), education
(years), cigarette smoking (never, former,
or current), systolic blood pressure
(mmHg), use of antihypertensive medica-
tion (yes/no), serum cholesterol concen-
tration (mg/dl), BMI (kg/m2), alcohol
consumption (0, 1­2, 3 drinks/day),
recreational exercise (much, moderate,
little, or no exercise), and nonrecreational
exercise (very active, moderately active,
or quite inactive).
Two-sample comparisons of categor-
ical and continuous variables were made
by using 2 tests and t tests, respectively.
Baseline characteristics and age-adjusted
incidence rates were directly standard-
ized to the age distribution from the 2000
census. Person-time was calculated for
each participant from the time of entry
into the study until one of the following
conditions occurred: the participant de-
veloped diabetes (1), the participant died
or left the study (2), or follow-up was
completed in 1992/1993 (3). The inde-
pendent association between pulmonary
function parameters or lung disease, as
assessed with the GOLD classification
scheme, at baseline and incidence of dia-
betes was examined using proportional
hazard models. To account for the com-
plex sampling design, SUDAAN software
was used in all analyses except for the
evaluation of proportionality assump-
tions, which was done with SAS. Analyses
showed that the proportionality assump-
tion was satisfied.
RESULTS -- Of the 14,407 partici-
pants in the NHEFS, 6,913 were included
in the cardiorespiratory subset and were
thus eligible for spirometry. After partici-
pants who were lost to follow-up were
excluded, 6,672 remained. Excluding
participants with prevalent diabetes re-
duced the sample size to 6,260, and fur-
ther exclusion of participants with
insufficient data to establish whether they
developed diabetes during follow-up left
6,112 participants. After excluding preg-
nant women, 6,069 participants re-
mained, and additional elimination of
participants with missing data for covari-
ates left 5,913 for analysis. Of this group,
4,830 participants had pulmonary func-
tion tests available; this group thus con-
stituted our final analytic sample. Of the
group, 443 developed diabetes during the
course of the study.
Participants who developed diabetes
were older than those who remained free
of the disease (Table 1). After adjustment
for age, participants who developed dia-
betes were less likely to be white, had
fewer years of education, had higher sys-
tolic blood pressure, were more likely to
be taking antihypertensive medication,
were heavier, and were more likely to be
sedentary than participants who re-
mained free of diabetes. In addition, par-

ticipants who developed diabetes had
lower mean percentage of predicted FEV1
and percentage of predicted FVC. The
groups had similar FEV1
-to-FVC ratios.
Finally, participants who developed dia-
betes were more likely to have restrictive
lung disease at baseline.
The FEV1, FVC, percentage of pre-
dicted FEV1
, and percentage predicted
FVC were significantly and inversely as-
sociated with the incidence of diabetes in
fully adjusted proportional hazards re-
gression models (Table 2). In contrast, the
ratio of FEV1
to FVC was not.
In unadjusted models, participants
with moderate or severe COPD or RLD
were at increased risk for developing dia-
betes (Table 3). In addition, participants
with symptoms had a borderline in-
creased risk. After age adjustment, only
participants with symptoms or RLD were
at increased risk for developing diabetes.
After full adjustment, however, only par-
ticipants with RLD were at increased risk
for developing diabetes (hazard ratio
[HR] 1.45, 95% CI 1.04­2.03). Addi-
tional adjustment for BMI2 did not mate-
rially affect the HR. Risk estimates did not
differ by sex (P  0.324 for the interac-
tion between sex and lung status) or race
or ethnicity (P  0.261 for the interaction
between race or ethnicity and lung sta-
tus). In addition, age (HR per year 1.03,
1.02­1.04), sex (HR for men versus
women 1.42, 1.08­1.88), education (HR
per year 0.96, 0.92­1.00), smoking status
(HR for current versus never smoking
1.36, 1.06 ­1.76), and BMI (HR per
kg/m2 1.12, 1.10­1.14) were signifi-
cantly associated with diabetes in the fully
adjusted proportional hazards regression
model. Adjusting for the number of pack
years smoked instead of the three levels of
smoking had very little effect on the HR
for RLD. However, using pack years re-
duced the sample size because of missing
data. To maximize sample size, we used
smoking status as a three level variable.
When we limited the proportional
hazards model to participants who had
never smoked (190 participants devel-
oped diabetes in this group of 2,013), the
multiple-adjusted HRs were 1.38 (95%
CI 0.67­2.84) for participants with mod-
erate to severe COPD, 0.87 (0.47­1.63)
for participants with mild COPD, 1.18
(0.71­1.94) for participants with respira-
tory symptoms, and 1.58 (0.94­2.66) for
participants with RLD. Among partici-
pants who were current smokers (148
participants developed diabetes in this
group of 1,750), the multiple-adjusted
HRs were 1.13 (0.68­1.86) for partici-
pants with moderate to severe COPD,
0.53 (0.22­1.29) for participants with
mild COPD, 1.10 (0.67­1.81) for partic-
ipants with respiratory symptoms, and
1.69 (0.89­3.21) for participants with
RLD. Among participants who were
former smokers (105 participants devel-
oped diabetes in this group of 1,067), the
multiple-adjusted HRs were 0.45 (0.20­
1.00) for participants with moderate to
severe COPD, 0.57 (0.22­1.44) for par-
ticipants with mild COPD, 0.77 (0.41­
1.44) for participants with respiratory
symptoms, and 1.35 (0.73­2.50) for par-
ticipants with RLD. The interaction be-
tween smoking status and pulmonary
status was not significant (P  0.502).
CONCLUSIONS -- Because associa-
tions between lung disease using the
GOLD classification and the incidence of
diabetes had not been studied previously,
our analyses provide new and unique in-

formation about potential links between
lung disease and diabetes. Our study of a
representative sample of the U.S. popula-
tion indicates that adults with RLD may
be at increased risk for developing diabe-
tes. Furthermore, as have other studies,
we found that FEV1
and FVC are signifi-
cantly associated with the incidence of di-
abetes. However, we did not find that the
ratio of these two parameters, which had
not been previously studied and are asso-
ciated with obstructive lung diseases, pre-
dicted the development of diabetes.
Several prospective studies have now
shown that parameters of pulmonary
function predict the onset of diabetes. In a
study of 4,637 nondiabetic Swedish men
(1) aged 48 years, 116 men who went on
to develop diabetes over 6 years had 10%
lower mean vital capacity at baseline than
men who did not develop diabetes. In the
Normative Aging Study (2), 1,050 nondi-
abetic men aged 21­80 years were fol-
lowed for an average of 20.9 years. FVC,
FEV1
, and MMEF were all inversely asso-
ciated with the development of insulin re-
sistance as measured with surrogate
measures (2). In the Men Born in 1914
Study (3), 382 nondiabetic men had spi-
rometry performed when they were 55
years of age. After 13 years of follow-up,
15 had developed diabetes. FEV1
and
FVC were inversely associated with inci-
dence of diabetes. In the Malmo Preven-
tive Study (4), 1,436 nondiabetic men
aged 35­52 years, of whom 144 devel-
oped diabetes, were followed for 13.9
years, and 896 nondiabetic women aged
38­57 years, of whom 42 developed dia-
betes, were followed for 9.4 years. The
percentage of predicted FVC was in-
versely associated with the incidence of
diabetes.
The findings from these prospective
studies may indicate that early in the
course of diabetes, before it is diagnosed,
lung function changes. If, in effect, the
development of diabetes impairs lung
function, the changes could be seen as
risk markers rather than risk factors for
diabetes. However, inflammation is
present in obstructive and RLD (13), and
several studies have shown that various
indicators of inflammation predict the de-
velopment of diabetes (14­19), although
a couple of studies failed to find a signif-
icant association (20,21). Thus, inflam-
mation associated with pulmonary
disorders could conceivably contribute to
the development of diabetes. If so, abnor-
mal pulmonary function or lung disease
could act as a risk factor for diabetes.
Several limitations of the present
study merit mentioning. The incidence of
diabetes was established from self-report,
hospitalization discharge, and death cer-
tificates, all of which provide less rigorous
definitions of diabetes than oral glucose
tolerance tests or fasting glucose concen-
trations. If the resulting misclassification
was nondifferential, the associations were
most likely underestimated. Neverthe-
less, end points based on these data
sources are commonly used, and known
risk factors for diabetes, such as excess
weight, are strongly associated with dia-
betes defined by using these data sources.
An additional limitation was that partici-
pants with type 1 diabetes could not be
distinguished from those with type 2 dia-
betes. However, the overwhelming ma-
jority of people who develop newly
diagnosed diabetes after age 30 years have
type 2 diabetes. We also did not have total
lung capacity available to classify people
according to the strictest criteria for RLD.
Our results may have been a spurious
finding. The inability to adjust for all rel-
evant confounding variables or residual
confounding could have accounted for
our results. Some relevant factors include
occupation, birth weight, body weight
distribution, and medication use, such as
corticosteroid use. Furthermore, we can-
not dismiss the possibility that detection
or diagnostic bias may explain our find-
ings. People who had abnormal pulmo-
nary function tests may have seen a doctor
more frequently during the follow-up pe-
riod, thus having an increased opportu-
nity to have diabetes diagnosed. If so,
such bias must have affected people with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and RLD differentially because we did not
find a significant association between
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and diabetes. Also, RLD may have repre-
sented an unknown factor that was truly
associated with the incidence of diabetes.
Conceivably, abnormal lung function
at baseline may have been associated with
worsening obesity rather than diabetes.
Unraveling the complexities of such an
association would require the availability
of anthropometric data at various points
in time during the follow-up period, es-
pecially at the time of diagnosis of diabe-
tes. Such data were not available for the
NHEFS. Other studies in which partici-
pants were periodically examined might
be able to assess such an explanation.
In conclusion, we found that FEV1

FVC, percentage of predicted FEV1

percentage of predicted FVC were in-
versely associated with the risk of devel-
oping diabetes in a representative cohort
of U.S. men and women, but the FEV1
-to-
FVC ratio was not. Furthermore, RLD but
not COPD was associated with a moder-
ate increase in the risk of diabetes. Our
results are consistent with results from
four other prospective studies suggesting
that abnormal lung function is associated
with an increased incidence of diabetes.
Even so, the association between lung dis-
ease and the development of diabetes
requires further study. Possible mecha-
nisms that link impaired lung function to
diabetes also need clarification.
