Objectives. Guided by the transtheoretical model of health behavior change, this study sought to explain why (a) rates
of advance care planning remain low in the general population and (b) surrogate decision makers are often inaccurate
about patients' end-of-life preferences.
Methods. The study used quantitative data from a cross-sectional internet survey conducted between July and October
2010. The 2,150 participants aged 18­64 belonged to 1,075 married or cohabiting heterosexual couples. Participants
included members of a nationally representative internet panel and a convenience sample from online advertisements.
Results. Older age was associated with a greater likelihood of having executed a living will and/or appointed a durable
power of attorney for health care. Both older age and poorer health were independently associated with a greater likeli-
hood of having discussed end-of-life health care treatment preferences. Completion of one's own end-of-life planning
was unrelated to one's ability to accurately report one's partner's treatment preferences.
Discussion. Readiness to plan for end of life appears to differ across planning behaviors. Age and health are related
to aspects of one's own advance care planning, but none of these factors are related to accuracy as a partner's surrogate.
Key Words: Advance care planning--Death and dying--Dyadic data--Medical decision making.
Terminally ill patients experience the burden of
incapacitating symptoms such that 30% of decedents
require treatment decisions they are no longer able to make
(Silveira, Kim, & Langa, 2010). U.S. states' statutes pro-
vide for advance directives (ADs), mechanisms that allow
patients to articulate their future medical treatment pref-
erences while still competent. Specifically, a living will
details the specific treatments a person would or would
not want if in a certain health condition, and a durable
power of attorney for health care (DPAHC) is a surrogate
permitted to make medical decisions on behalf of an inca-
pacitated patient. ADs are associated with decreased symp-
tom burden and improved communication between health
care professionals and patients' families at the end of life
(Teno, Gruneir, Schwartz, Nanda, & Wetle, 2007). In add-
ition to ADs, individuals can also make informal plans.
Patients' discussions with family and physicians are not
legally binding, but discussions with physicians do result
in care that is more consistent with patients' wishes than
is the care of persons who do not hold discussions (Mack,
Weeks, Wright, Block, & Prigerson, 2010). Together, ADs
and informal discussions are known as advanced care
planning (ACP).
Despite the documented efficacy of ACP, research also
highlights its limitations, including low rates of AD com-
pletion in the general population, restrictions on who may
serve as a DPAHC, ADs that are missing signatures and
notarization, DPAHCs' difficulty in determining what care
the patient would choose for him or herself, inaccessibil-
ity of ADs at the time of treatment decisions, and more
(Castillo et al., 2011). These problems have persisted for
over two decades, despite measures such as Congressional
legislation requiring that hospitals offer ACP assistance to
patients (Emanuel, Weinberg, Gonin, Hummel, & Emanuel,
1993). Recently, end-of-life scholars have begun to turn
to theories of health behavior change from other areas of
study to gain leverage over the problems (Fried, Bullock,
Iannone, & O'Leary, 2009). Thus, this study applies the
transtheoretical model (TTM) of health behavior change
to guide thinking on two of the most pressing of these
problems: (a) encouraging people to complete end-of-life
planning well in advance of incapacitating illness and (b)
fostering DPAHC accuracy.
The study addresses these issues in a national sample
of 1,075 heterosexual American couples aged 18­64.
Couples are the focus because ACP is a distinctly family-
based process. Among married older persons who have
appointed a DPAHC, three quarters have appointed their
spouse; most states designate the spouse as the surrogate
decision maker if the patient has not appointed a DPAHC;
and conversations about end-of-life care typically happen
between spouses (Carr & Khodyakov, 2007). Persons aged
18­64 are the focus because ACP done only at the end of
life is often deemed "too late" to be helpful or meaningful;
thus, it is important to begin the process when one is a
working-age adult (Sudore & Fried, 2010).
98 MOORMAN AND INOUE
TTM of Health Behavior Change
The TTM was developed as a framework to explain
human health behavior change by integrating the strengths
of the major schools of psychotherapy, including psychoa-
nalysis, cognitive-behavior approaches, person-centered
therapy, and more (Prochaska & Norcross, 1999). The
TTM was intended to be generalizable to a wide range of
behaviors including those outside of a mental health context
and has been applied to over 50 behaviors (e.g., smoking
cessation, medication adherence, and breast cancer screen-
ing; Prochaska, 2008). The TTM posits that people will be
unprepared to make any change so long as they lack motiva-
tion for decision making (e.g., in the absence of an immedi-
ate health threat) and guides scholars and practitioners to
consider patients' level of motivation and degree of readi-
ness to change.
The specific constructs of the model that address motiva-
tion and readiness are the stages of change, which describe
how individuals move from having no intention to change
(precontemplation), to considering change (contempla-
tion), committing to change in the near future (preparation),
completing change (action), and sustaining change (main-
tenance). The process advances as patients' assessments of
the ratio of the costs of change to the benefits of change,
or decisional balance, shift (Prochaska, 2008). Health
care professionals encourage shifts in decisional balance
through use of the processes of change, activities such as
consciousness-raising and self-evaluation that motivate and
prepare people to change. Processes of change must be tai-
lored to the individual's stage of change in order to be effec-
tive; processes that help a "preparer" toward change may
have no effect on a "precontemplator."
Several scholars have used the TTM to guide their studies
of ACP, conceiving of discussion, AD completion, and AD
revision as a set of preventive health behaviors that should
occur repeatedly over time (Fried et al., 2009). One's deci-
sional balance must shift such that one recognizes and
values the benefits of planning enough to undertake the psy-
chological stress of spending time considering one's own
death and dying. These scholars conclude that beginning
ACP well in advance of health crises helps to ensure that
by the time one requires terminal care, one is prepared and
ready (Finnell et al., 2011; Fried et al., 2010; Sudore et al.,
2008).
One Persistent Problem: Rates of ACP
In line with the TTM's postulate that health threats
motivate people to change their health behavior, research
shows that efforts to increase rates of ACP have been very
successful among high-risk groups. Among nursing home
residents, for instance, 70% have an AD (Resnick, Schuur,
Heineman, Stone, & Weissman, 2009). Yet, rates of end-
of-life planning remain low in the general population, in
which only a third of all adults aged 18 and older have ADs
(Pollack, Morhaim, & Williams, 2010). Interestingly, older
persons are more likely to have made funeral plans than
to have prepared for their future care needs (Pinquart &
Sörensen, 2002).
Some scholars assert that low rates of ACP in the gen-
eral population are not troubling, because care preferences
change over the life course (Ditto, Jacobson, Smucker,
Danks, & Fagerlin, 2006). Planning may even prevent
patients from receiving care congruent with their wishes if
health care providers and family members rely on out-of-
date plans. The TTM counters this argument in two ways.
First, the TTM is a process model. People cannot quickly
and easily move from precontemplation to action; it is
not optimal to wait to think about care options until they
are needed. ACP will be more effective and less stressful
when people begin the process long before they require
care. Second, a case in which a person created plans but
did not periodically update them would be considered
relapse under the TTM. In the maintenance stage, posi-
tive health behaviors are sustained (Prochaska & Norcross,
1999). ACP need not occur as regularly as a health behav-
ior such as exercise, but it does require occasional review
and revision.
Two primary influences on ACP in the general popula-
tion are age and health status. Multiple studies have docu-
mented that the older one's age, the more likely one is to
have an AD (Pollack et al., 2010). The most frequent rea-
son older adults give for not having plans is that they are
"too healthy," and the most common reason they give for
having plans is a medical condition (Pollack et al., 2010;
Schickedanz et al., 2009).
Drawing a distinction between age and health as
influences on individuals' decisional balance is important
in the TTM: Interventions to increase rates of end-of-life
planning may fail if they do not use appropriate processes
of change to target specific barriers to planning (Prochaska,
2008). Prior studies have conflated age and health status by
taking one of three approaches: (a) limiting participants to
older persons; (b) recruiting participants from health care
settings; or (c) approaching the problem via prospect theory.
Prospect theory states that options, or prospects, are more
easily differentiated the closer they are to one's present
reference point (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Thus, an
ill and/or elderly person will rank poor health states on a
continuum of more to less acceptable, whereas a young and/
or healthy person will not distinguish, instead wanting to
avoid all negative health states similarly (Winter & Parker,
2007). Using the prospect theory approach, the operational
factor is neither age nor health alone, but rather a subjective
blending of the two that results in an evaluation based on
the expected time until end of life.
This article compares the applicability of the TTM and
prospect theory to the action stage, completion of vari-
ous ACP behaviors. The TTM would posit that age and
health operate independently with relation to ACP, whereas
99
END-OF-LIFE PLANNING
prospect theory suggests that age and health interact in their
effects on ACP. Thus, we ask the research question:
Research Question 1: What are the relationships among
health status, age, and completion of ADs and informal dis-
cussions?
The statistical models further account for race, socio-
economic status, marital status, and gender, factors that
have been shown to be correlated with both self-reported
health and the propensity to complete ACP. Non-White per-
sons, persons with low educational attainment and income,
unmarried persons, and women report lower self-reported
health than their peers (McGee, Liao, Cao, & Cooper,
1999). White persons, persons of high socioeconomic sta-
tus, and married persons are most likely to have ADs (Carr
& Khodyakov, 2007). Men are most likely to have ADs,
whereas women are most likely to have held informal dis-
cussions (Carr & Khodyakov, 2007).
A Second Persistent Problem: Surrogate Accuracy
A second major concern about ACP is the frequency with
which DPAHCs do not know the incapacitated patient's
preferences. The legal standard for decision making is that
of substituted judgment, whereby the DPAHC chooses the
treatment the patient would have chosen for him or herself
if competent to do so (Sabatino, 2010). Numerous studies
using hypothetical decision-making scenarios match partic-
ipants' preferences against surrogates' reports of those pref-
erences. Together, these studies indicate that surrogates are
no better than chance at correctly identifying one another's
preferences (Shalowitz, Garrett-Mayer, & Wendler, 2006).
Thus far, researchers have been unable to identify many
alterable factors that enhance surrogate accuracy. One
study indicates that pairs do better when both surrogate and
patient are African American rather than White (Schmid,
Allen, Haley, & DeCoster, 2010). Another found that
spouses are more accurate surrogates than are adult chil-
dren (Parks et al., 2011). But men and women are equally
poor surrogates, the surrogates of persons in poor health are
no more likely to be accurate than the surrogates of persons
in good health, and most disturbingly, discussions between
patient and partner have no effect on surrogate accuracy
(Ditto et al., 2001; Moorman, Hauser, & Carr, 2009). The
strongest predictor of surrogate accuracy is the surrogate's
preference for his or her own care (Moorman et al., 2009).
That is, surrogates appear to experience cognitive biases
wherein they project their own preferences onto the patient
either because they fail at perspective taking or because
they truly believe the patient to be similar to themselves
(Lowenstein, 2005).
The TTM has not yet been applied to research on sur-
rogate accuracy. But it may serve as a helpful conceptual
tool in this area of research, because studies using the TTM
to examine ACP have reached varying empirical conclu-
sions. Sudore and colleagues (2008) found that discussion
was a part of the contemplation and preparation stages and
preceded AD completion. But Fried and colleagues (2010)
found that living will execution, DPAHC appointment, and
discussion each constituted the action stage of separate pro-
cesses. For example, a patient could have executed a living
will but still have no intention to discuss it with family or
physicians.
The TTM posits that people can plan for themselves only
when they are ready and prepared. Applying this proposi-
tion to surrogate accuracy suggests that only surrogates
who are ready and prepared are able to fully empathize
with patients' preferences, because only then will they have
the decisional balance required to overcome the difficulty
of thinking about a loved one's death and dying. Thus,
this study separates those with the most positive attitudes
toward planning, "actors" who have completed their own
ACP, from persons who have no plans and thus some degree
of uncertainty about planning. Finding that a surrogate's
own ACP completion is associated with his or her accuracy
as a surrogate would be evidence that ACP behaviors build
upon one another in a single process, as Sudore and col-
leagues (2008) found. Finding that a surrogate's own ACP
is unassociated with his or her accuracy would indicate that
ACP behaviors are the culmination of separate preparation
processes, as Fried and colleagues (2010) found. Thus, we
ask the research question:
Research Question 2: Is the existence of one's own end-of-life
plans related to the accuracy of one's reports of a partner's
treatment preference?
The statistical models further account for surrogate's
treatment preference, age, race, socioeconomic status,
and gender, the couple's relationship duration and marital
status, and the self-reported health of both partners. Prior
research has yielded few measures reliably associated with
surrogate accuracy, but these factors seem likely candidates.
For instance, couples who are legally married and have
been together a long time may have more motivation and
more opportunity to know their partner's preferences than
cohabiting and new couples.
Method
Data
We used data from an internet survey conducted by
Knowledge Networks, in conjunction with the National
Center for Family and Marriage Research at Bowling
Green State University, between July and October of 2010.
This cross-sectional study included a sample of 2,150
participants aged 18­64 who belonged to one of 1,075
married or cohabiting heterosexual couples residing in the
United States. Seventy percent of the couples were married
and 30% were cohabiting.
In 1999, Knowledge Networks used probability-based
sampling methodology to establish the first online research
100 MOORMAN AND INOUE
panel (KnowledgePanel; www.knowledgepanel.com/) that is
representative of the U.S. population. Panel members agreed
to participate in multiple surveys over time in exchange for
"incentive points" redeemable for cash. If the panel members
did not have access to the Internet, Knowledge Networks pro-
vided the necessary equipment free of charge. The couples in
thisstudywereprimarilyrecruitedfromtheKnowledgePanel.
All married couples were panelists. Of cohabiting couples, a
third were panelists. To be counted as a valid response, both
partners had to complete a valid survey. Recruitment within
the panel yielded a 50% response from married couples and
a 41% response from cohabiting couples.
Additional two sources were used to generate the remain-
der of the sample of cohabiting couples: 10% of cohabiting
couples comprised a KnowledgePanel member and partner
who was not on the panel and 57% of cohabiting couples
comprised two partners recruited through online adver-
tisements (i.e., a non-probability sample). Recruitment of
panel members and their off-panel partners yielded only a
5% response rate. Response rates are not calculable for con-
venience samples; so, response to the web advertisement is
unknown. Supplementary analyses indicated that the results
of this study were similar for cohabiting couples regardless
of means of recruitment. Therefore, the three groups were
pooled in the analyses presented here.
AD Completion
AD completion was assessed based on the following
two questions: "Have you made any legal arrangements
for someone to make decisions about your medical care
if you become unable to make those decisions yourself?
This is sometimes called a durable power of attorney for
health care" and "Do you have a living will or advance
directive? These are written instructions about the type of
medical treatment you would want to receive if you were
unconscious or somehow unable to communicate." The
AD variable had two mutually exclusive categories: has an
AD (living will and/or DPAHC) and has no formal plans
(neither living will nor DPAHC).
Participants without an AD were provided with eight
closed-ended responses and asked to endorse as many rea-
sons as applied for having no AD. Responses were aggre-
gated into four codes. The category "Lacking information"
included "I did not know this measure existed," "I do not
know how to go about doing this," and "I do not believe
this measure affects treatment." The category "Death avoid-
ance" included "I have not thought about my treatment
preferences" and "I do not want to think about dying and
illness." The category "Other persons" included "My pref-
erences are already known to others" and "I do not want
to burden anyone with this responsibility." Finally, the cat-
egory "Current good health" included "My health is cur-
rently good." Participants were tallied in all categories in
which they endorsed at least one reason.
Informal Discussion
Informal discussion is a dichotomous variable based on
the following question: "Have you discussed with anyone
plans about the types of medical treatment you want or
don't want if you become seriously ill in the future?" Those
who had had a discussion were coded as 1 and those who
had not were coded as 0. Participants who had not had a
discussion responded why, using the same procedure and
questions as for participants who had no AD, above.
Surrogate Accuracy
Participants were told "We have some questions about the
kind of decisions you might make when considering your
own health at the end of life. Suppose you had a serious ill-
ness today with very low chances of survival. What if you
were mentally intact, but in severe and constant physical
pain? Please select the number that best represents the level
of treatment you would like." Participants answered using
a scale ranging from 0 (stop all life-prolonging treatment)
to 10 (continue all treatment). Intermediate anchors were
not labeled and represented degrees of response for persons
who would prefer a more or less aggressive course of care,
having some treatments and forgoing others. Then, partici-
pants were asked "Now please think about your spouse or
partner. Suppose your spouse/partner had a serious illness
today with very low chances of survival. What if s/he were
mentally intact, but in severe and constant physical pain?
Please select the number that best represents the level of
treatment s/he would like." The participants then selected
the number between 0 and 10 that they felt best represented
the level of treatment their partner would like.
We constructed two outcome variables matching one
partner's report of the other's preference against the other
partner's actual preference for self. One variable subtracted
each male partner's actual preferences from his female
partner's report of his preference, and the other subtracted
each female partner's actual preferences from her male
partner's report. Therefore, a score of 0 represented accuracy,
whereaspositivescoresindicatedanerrorofovertreatment--a
surrogate believing that the other wanted more care than he
or she indicated wanting--and negative scores indicated an
error of undertreatment--a surrogate believing that the other
wanted less care than he or she indicated wanting. These
variables had few extreme values: Only 6.1% of women and
4.3% of men made a full 10-point error. Thus, the variables
were made categorical as follows: under by 3 or more,
under by 1­2, accurate, over by 1­2, and over by 3 or more.
Supplemental analyses indicated that the results are similar
under alternate categorizations (e.g., using seven categories;
classifying 1-unit of difference as "accurate").
Age and Self-Reported Health
The key independent variables of interest for the
first research question were participants' age and their
101
END-OF-LIFE PLANNING
self-reported health status. Age was a continuous variable
which ranged from 18 to 64 years. Perceived health sta-
tus was derived from the following question: "In general,
would you say your health is excellent, very good, good,
fair, or poor?" The data showed skew; 88.0% of participants
reported that their health was excellent, very good, or good.
Therefore, the variable was dichotomized such that fair and
poor were coded as 1, and good, very good, and excellent
are coded as 0.
For the second research question, age and health status
were treated as couple-level characteristics. The older part-
ner's age entered into regressions. The reference category
for health comprised men in good, very good, or excel-
lent health (i.e., healthy) partnered with women in good,
very good, or excellent health. The remaining categories
included men in fair or poor health (i.e., unhealthy) part-
nered with healthy women, unhealthy women partnered
with healthy men, and couples in which both partners were
unhealthy.
Individual Sociodemographic Characteristics
Individual sociodemographic characteristics included
education, race/ethnicity, and gender. Education was a vari-
able with three categories: high school or less (reference
category), some college education, and bachelor's degree or
higher. Race/ethnicity had four categories: White non-His-
panic (reference category), Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic,
and other. The "other" category included the 39 respond-
ents who reported belonging to two or more racial catego-
ries. Female was a dichotomous variable where women are
coded as 1 and men formed the reference category.
Couple Sociodemographic Characteristics
Sociodemographic characteristics of the couple included
marital status, relationship duration, and household income.
For marital status, categories included cohabiting and mar-
ried (reference). Relationship duration referred to the num-
ber of years the couple had been dating. Annual household
income was an ordinal variable with 19 categories; the
smallest category was "less than $5,000," and the largest
category was "$175,000 or more."
Analytic Strategy
First, the proportion of participants having each type
of plan was calculated, along with the reasons non-plan-
ners gave for lacking plans. Average treatment prefer-
ences for self and partner and the proportion accurate
were calculated. Then, the research question on health,
age, and individual planning was tested through a
sequence of binary logistic regression models compar-
ing persons with plans to persons without. The unit of
analysis was individuals; to adjust for within-couple
correlations, results were corrected for the clustering of
2,150 individuals in 1,075 couples. For each outcome,
the first model included age, health status, marital status,
income, educational attainment, race/ethnicity, and gen-
der as independent variables. The second model added
the interaction of age and health. Regression models
excluded reasons for not planning because participants
could report multiple reasons.
The research question on couple concordance was tested
through two separate multinomial logistic regression mod-
els, one for women performing as surrogates and one for
men performing as surrogates. Independent variables
included the planning status of both partners, the treatment
preference, educational attainment, and race/ethnicity of
the partner performing as surrogate, and the couple's mari-
tal status, relationship duration, and household income.
All analyses were weighted to render the sample rep-
resentative of the U.S. population of heterosexual married
and cohabiting adults. Most cases had complete data on
the measures of interest. Income was the variable missing
the most observations, at 44 (2%) cases. Listwise deletion
was used.
Results
Descriptive Statistics
Few of these working-aged adults had planned for end of
life. Only 28% had an AD (i.e., living will and/or DPAHC).
Slightly over half (55%) reported having discussed their
end-of-life treatment preferences with another person. The
predominant reason participants gave for having no ACP
was death avoidance (e.g., "I do not want to think about
dying and illness"). The average participant's treatment
preference was moderate: On a scale ranging from 0 (stop
all life-prolonging treatment) through 10 (continue all
treatment), the mean score was 5.23 (SD = 3.60). Using
the same scale, the average participant thought that their
partner's treatment preference would be 5.51 (SD = 3.58).
Approximately a third of men and women were accurate
about their partner's preference, with no significant
differences between men and women. Descriptive statistics
on all variables used in the analysis has been given in
Table 1.
Health Status, Age, and ACP
Regression results for the first research question are pre-
sented in Table 2. Age was associated with completion of
ADs. A 1-year increase in age was associated with a 4%
increase in the odds of having an AD (p < .001). Self-
reported health status was not significantly associated with
AD completion. In Model 2, age and health status did not
have a statistically significant interactive relationship to AD
completion.
Both age and self-reported health were significantly
associated with the odds of having held a discussion. An
102 MOORMAN AND INOUE
additional year of age was associated with a 3% increase
in the odds of having a discussion (p < .001). Persons in
fair or poor health had 85% greater odds of having had a
discussion than persons in good, very good, or excellent
health (p < .01). In Model 2, the interaction of age and
health was not significant.
Other control variables, including marital status and race/
ethnicity, were significantly related to ACP. These results
are explored elsewhere (Carr, 2012) and are consistent with
prior literature.
Surrogate Accuracy
Regression results for the second research question are
presented in Table 3. One's own planning had little to do
with one's ability to correctly report one's partner's prefer-
ences. Having one's own AD decreased the odds of making
a small error of overtreatment (OR = 0.39, p < .05); other-
wise, no comparisons were statistically significant. There
were no statistically significant gender differences; that is,
men's planning status was also unrelated to their accuracy
in reporting women's preferences. Therefore, results for
men are not shown, but are available upon request.
Discussion
This internet survey study of 1,075 heterosexual married
or cohabiting couple dyads aged 18­64 revealed two impor-
tant findings about end-of-life planning in the United States.
First, age and health appear to have independent relation-
ships to both formal and informal aspects of ACP, in line
with the TTM. Second, one's own readiness to plan does
not render one ready to perform as a surrogate for one's
partner; an individual's completion of ACP was unrelated
to the accuracy of one's proxy reports of partners' treatment
preferences. These results indicate potential new directions
for public health campaigns related to ACP.
Age, Health, and Stages of Change
The findings in this study confirm those of other recent
research and expand upon them by using the framing prin-
ciples of the TTM. In this study, 28% of adults 18­64 had
reached the action stage with regard to AD completion;
this figure is similar to the 34% reported in a representative
sample of Maryland residents aged 18 and older (Pollack
et al., 2010). Over half (55%) had discussed their care pref-
erences with someone.
As in prior studies, age was a strong predictor of ACP,
with older adults more likely to have both ADs and discus-
sions (Pollack et al., 2010). Poorer health status was related
to increased likelihood of discussions but not related to
AD completion, and there was no interactive association
between age and health status for any ACP behavior. These
results are evidence in support of the TTM, which stresses
the importance of disentangling potential influences on
behavior. These results do not support prospect theory,
which suggests that age and health interact in their effects
on ACP (Winter & Parker, 2007).

END-OF-LIFE PLANNING
The TTM stresses the importance of matching processes
of change to an individual's stage of change (Prochaska,
2008). Three of the four reasons for not planning offered
in this study--lacking information, wish to avoid thinking
about death, and current good health--seem indicative of
the precontemplation stage of change in which people do not
even consider planning. The processes of change most effec-
tive for moving persons beyond precontemplation include
consciousness-raising, dramatic relief, and environmental
evaluation. Practical factual information (i.e., consciousness-
raising) about why ACP is important and how it is done is
likely to appeal to pre-contemplators. However, informational
interventions may fail if they do not also include emotional
material or raise empathy (i.e., dramatic relief and environ-
mental evaluation). Qualitative research indicates that adults
identify concern for self or others and stories, experiences,
and anecdotal evidence as the major influences on their plan-
ning behavior (Levi, Dellasega, Whitehead, & Green, 2010).
Perspectives on Surrogate Decision Making
Based on the TTM model of stages of change, this study
asked whether completion of one's own ACP might result
in enhanced ability to understand one's partner's treatment
preferences. However, completion of one's own ACP was
unrelated to accuracy at reporting one's partner's preferences.
Although Sudore and colleagues (2008) found that commu-
nication was a precursor to the action stage of completing
ADs, Fried and colleagues (2010) found that ACP behaviors
were independent. The present results lend some support to
Fried and colleagues' conclusion: Being in the action stage
with regard to one's own plans appears unrelated to one's
stage of preparation to serve as a surrogate decision maker.
In the search for factors related to surrogate accuracy, null
results are mounting: Discussion does not help surrogates
better understand specific preferences (Ditto et al., 2001),
nor does a surrogate's own experience of ill health help with
perspective taking (Moorman et al., 2009). Perhaps a more
attainable standard than substituted judgment could both
protect patient autonomy and ensure quality care (Sabatino,
2010).
Limitations

prevent it from being representative of the general popu-
lation. In the general population, African Americans are
underrepresented among married couples and overrepre-
sented among cohabiting couples (U.S. Census Bureau,
2010). Thus, because the present sample is 70% married
dyads, fewer African Americans appear than would appear
in a general population sample. Further, the couples in this
study were heterosexual. The results cannot be generalized
to gay or lesbian adults.
Second, self-reported health was the only measure of
health. Other studies indicate that a relationship between
health and ACP is evident for other measures of health
(Carr & Khodyakov, 2007; Fried et al., 2010). Future
research might further compare the TTM with prospect
theory when examining the relationships between perceived
and objective health status with regard to the stages of ACP.
Third, this study cannot make full use of the TTM
because it measured only some constructs. Non-planners
were not asked about the potential benefits of planning; so,
no measure of decisional balance was available. Thus, par-
ticipants in the action stage were easily identified, but the
stages of other participants could not be determined.

END-OF-LIFE PLANNING
Finally,thedatawerecross-sectional,aparticularweakness
when employing a time-based theory. Typically, researchers
operationalize the stages of change across a 6-month time
horizon, where precontemplators do not intend to change
their behavior in the next 6 months, but contemplators intend
to change within 6 months, and preparers, 1 month (Finnell
et al., 2011). This study has neither measures of intentions
nor follow-up measures of actual decisions.
Conclusion
This study joins the recent wave of interest in applying
TTM of health behavior change as a framework for thinking
about ACP. Because preferences for care take shape over
time, the aspects of the TTM that treat behavior change as a
process are well suited to the ACP context. Future use of the
TTM may allow scholars and practitioners to design new
methods of helping patients to prepare for their own death
and dying, as well as that of close others.
