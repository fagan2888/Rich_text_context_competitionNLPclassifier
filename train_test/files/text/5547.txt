Movies offer the perfect media site for placement of brands as part of the emerging
marketing strategy. Although attempts to analyse brand placements have been made
in the past, the same needs more attention in the Indian context. Given the exposure of
Indian audiences to both national and international entertainment industry, it is only
reasonable to expect the entertainment event context to have an impact on consumers'
evaluation of the brands placed in each context.
The present research attempts to extend the applicability of the idea of fit, which was
till now largely confined to sponsorship and subjects it to the exploration of finding a
fit between brands and specific events, in particular, movies. Because the link between
country of origin of the entertainment event (national/international) and brand, place-
ment is a relevant area of speculation, the present research aims to study this relation-
ship within the national/international context. Results of an experimental study among
120 respondents are as follows:
· Brands placed in a national event will create more positive brand evaluations in
terms of positive attitude towards the placed brand and intention to purchase than
brands that are placed in an international event.
· When the presence of a brand is consistent with the context in which it is placed, it
would evoke more positive attitudes and behaviour than an incongruent placement.
· Evaluation of results further reveals that although a brand that fits well with the
context in which it is placed generates a positive evaluation of the placed brand, the
condition of a brand-event misfit in a Hollywood context will create more negative
evaluations among the Indian audiences than if such a disconnect appeared in a
Hindi film. In other words, a brand may have more to lose in case of a misfit with the
international entertainment event than with a national entertainment event.
Based on the findings of the present study, it is suggested that multinational brands
must look at the Indian movies as a suitable medium for reaching out to the prospective
buyers as Indians have become consumers of global brands and thus pose to be a huge
market for global brands.

Summary
150 CONSUMER RESPONSE TO BRAND PLACEMENT IN MOVIES: INVESTIGATING THE BRAND-EVENT FIT
As the line between entertainment and marketing
communication gets increasingly blended or
even erased (de Gregorio & Sung, 2010; Eagle,
2007; Steel, 2007; Winkler & Buckner, 2006), the notion
of brand placement in an entertainment context receives
considerable attention from scholars and practitioners
alike. Although there are many definitions of the term,
brand or product placement have often been used inter-
changeably and generally refer to the use of a prod-
uct's name, packaging, signage, or other trademarks in
media (Steortz, 1987).
Screening thousands of films every year, the film industry
is fast emerging as the medium with the maximum
potential to capture and convert audiences to potential
consumers. Tag Heuer in Don (2006), Coke in Dhoom 2
(2006), Singapore Tourism Board in Krrish (2006), or Pepsi
in Pearl Harbour (2001), product placements have a very
significant role in Indian1 and international2 movies. Such
placements have also started to appear in television series
(Fitzgerald, 2002), live shows (Matthews, 2005), video-
games (Gunn, 2001; Nelson, Keum, & Yaros, 2004), and
even books (Kretchmer, 2004; Moser, Bryant, & Sylvester,
2004; Turner, 2004). The reason behind using product
placement in these media, however, remains the same:
generating additional income for the producer while
creating an opportunity for the advertisers to present
their offering in an entertainment context (Russell &
Belch, 2005). By doing so, not only does the offering reach
a larger audience, but it also gets a much longer life than
a 30-second commercial.
While product placement is riskier than conventional
advertising, it is becoming a common practice to place
products and brands into mainstream media, including
films, which are an extremely popular medium among
advertisers. Also, with the traditional media getting
overcrowded and nearly saturated, the concept of
product placement has become even more popular
as a communication technique, which is now being
used more than ever by advertisers (Karrh, Mckee,
& Pardum, 2003). A lot of research has focused on
product placement in all its forms (Gupta & Gould,
2007; Nelson, 2002), but more specifically on product
placement in movies (Karrh, 1998). Brand placement
in movies seems to be well accepted (O'Reilly, Cripps,
Kazani, Patel, & Zarra, 2005) and is sometimes consid-
ered less expensive and more effective than a 30-second
TV spot (Jaffe, 2005), resulting in a more frequent use of
this communication technique.
However, in the era of expanding global competition,
where companies are trying hard to reach out to their
customers effectively and efficiently to market their
product and services to different national cultures,
an important yet lurking question that remains unan-
swered is: To what extent have marketers been able
to successfully reach their customers? Although
product placement utilizes the global reach of movies,
minimal research has been conducted to study the
effects of product placement across cultures. Therefore,
of particular interest in this study is the influence of
brand placements in an entertainment event, especially
movies that represent two different cultures. How do
viewers perceive brands placed in movies? Do brands
placed in Indian movies have a different impact on
viewers than brands placed in international movies?
Should the advertisers and marketers, therefore, view
the placement of their brands in national and interna-
tional entertainment contexts differently? To answer
these questions, the study focuses on the opinions of
people who are viewers of both Indian and interna-
tional movies.
A review of brand placement studies indicates a major
gap in the literature. Previous studies of brand place-
ment were largely conducted in the US with little focus
on it as a global phenomenon (DeLorme, 1998; Grein
& Grould, 1996) given the fact that many movies play
to and are often produced for multinational audiences,
raising the issue of how consumers in other countries
perceive product placements. Also, while product
placement has been researched extensively (Karrh,
1998; McKechnie & Zhou, 2003; Russell & Belch, 2005)
in studies that have focused on one or more of the
placement's characteristics, in particular, its prom-
inence (Gupta & Lord, 1998; Russell, 1998, 2002) and
plot connection (d'Astous & Chartier, 2000; Fontaine,
2002; Russell, 2002), it is not clear from the previous
studies if a brand placed in a matching context would
have any effect on consumer's evaluation behaviour.
And till date no study, either at the national or the inter-
national level, has examined the effects of brand place-
ment's fit/misfit within movies. Being the first of its
kind, the present study finds its need and relevance by
investigating congruence between entertainment event
and brand.
Furthermore, given the exposure of Indian audiences
to both national and international entertainment
industry, it is only reasonable to expect the country of
origin of the entertainment event to have an impact
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 2 · APRIL-JUNE 2016 151
on consumer's evaluation. Because the link between
the country of origin of the entertainment event and
brand placement is a relevant area of speculation,
the present research aims to study this relationship
including national/international context. And even
though measures of product placement evaluation
have been problematic, product placement is a fast
growing multi-billion dollar industry (McDonnell
& Drennan, 2010) making the present study relevant
for both, advertisers and marketers. A great deal of
research has already been devoted to product place-
ment in movies; however, this article strives to present,
for the first time, the effect of fit between brand and the
entertainment event on consumer's brand evaluation.
BRAND PLACEMENT IN MOVIES
There are enough reasons that suggest the growth of
product placement. The erosion of traditional media
audience and its fragmentation on the one hand
(Deloitte, 2005) and the use of alternate media such as
the internet, allowing consumers to skip ads (O'Neill &
Barrett, 2004) on the other hand, has forced the adver-
tisers to seek a more reliable media to re-establish the
link between their offering and their consumers. In
such a scenario, product placement has surfaced as
an important tool for the advertisers and marketers,
posing as competition to the traditional commercial
medium of advertising.
In movies, the role of brand placement has increased
in recent times. Initially, brands were typically featured
in movies in three ways: the product itself was shown,
a logo of the brand was displayed, or a brand was
displayed as a background prop (Smith, 1985). The role
has changed ever since, from the brand being a mere
prop in the background to being a central part of the
movie, thereby increasing its prominence. The promi-
nence of brand placement is defined as `the capacity of
the brand to attract the spectator's attention' (Fontaine,
2001). Among other factors, such as the size and dura-
tion of the brand's placement on screen (Fontaine,
2002), this capacity can be linked to the brand's location
in the scene (Gupta & Lord, 1998) and the number of
times the brand appears on the screen (Bressoud, Lehu,
& Russell, 2008).
No matter how the brand is placed in the movie, by
using brand placement, marketers hope to gain an
advantage in comparison with the traditional commer-
cial advertising format. The availability of a captive
audience with greater reach than traditional advertise-
ments and the advantage of showing brands in their
natural environment (Stephan & Coote, 2005) provide
motivation for product placements (Deigh, 1985;
Hulin-Salkin, 1989; Turcotte, 1995). Therefore, brand
placement provides an opportunity where the involved
audience gets exposure to the brands and products
during the natural process of narration of the movie.
The audience can undertake multiple tasks while
watching a television programme in a home setting,
which may affect the level and degree of the attention
span of the audience and hence reduce the overall effec-
tiveness of the medium for enhancing brand memory.
In the case of watching a movie in the theatre, the
audience makes a voluntary choice for viewing (expo-
sure) at a cost (financial, time, and opportunity cost)
for the purpose of entertainment, which makes him
more receptive to the information provided. Further,
the trend of zapping and change in television usage
behaviour due to surfing during commercial breaks has
reduced the effectiveness of television commercials.
And clearly, brand placements in movies also result
in a longer lifespan for the brands than typical adver-
tisements (Brennan, Dubas, & Babin, 1999; d'Astous &
Chartier, 2000).
While brand placement has obvious advantages, it is
not without its disadvantages. Such disadvantages
stem from the marketer's general lack of control over
the brand placement process. Exposure does not actu-
ally guarantee that the placement will be noticed (Van
der Waldt, 2005). Also, there is little control over how
and when the brand will be shown or whether it will be
shown at all, as the risk of the scene featuring the brand
being edited runs high (Bergman, 1989) and the risk of
a negative portrayal of the brand in the movie setting
(Fleming, 1990). However, despite the pitfalls which
may not allow brand placements to stand as the lone
marketing tool, it is becoming an increasingly impor-
tant part of the integrated marketing strategy.
REVIEW OF LITERATURE AND HYPOTHESES
Over a period of time, researchers have used a number
of terms for the same purpose that somewhat overlap
each other. The term advertainment (Russell, 2007) was
coined to reflect the increasingly intertwined connec-
tions between advertising and entertainment and
refers to the promotional practices that integrate brand
communications within the content of entertainment
152 CONSUMER RESPONSE TO BRAND PLACEMENT IN MOVIES: INVESTIGATING THE BRAND-EVENT FIT
products. The increased mingling of advertising with
the entertainment world has generated a slew of newly
coined terms to reflect the trends, such as hybrid adver-
tisement (Balasubramanian, 1994), branded entertain-
ment (Hudson & Hudson, 2006), and brand placement
and product placement. In one of the first reviews of
brand placement, Karrh (1998) argues that although
product placement is the most commonly used descrip-
tion, brand placement would be more correct. He argues
that it is a brand (e.g., Ray-Ban) and not a product
(e.g., sunglasses) that is placed. However, not many
researchers distinguish between the two and, therefore,
the terms brand placement and product placement have
been used interchangeably throughout the study.
Despite the widespread use of brand placements to
reach audiences, it is difficult to ascertain its effective-
ness because much of the related data is proprietary
(Yang, Roskos-Ewoldsen, & Roskos-Ewoldsen, 2004).
Consequently, too little is known about the effect of
brand placements given the dynamic nature of this prac-
tice (Bhatnagar, Aksoy, & Malkoc, 2004). For example,
how the brands are placed in the movies may influence
their effectiveness (Ong & Meri, 1994). Indeed, scholars
have tested the effect of different types of brand place-
ments, such as whether the placement is visual or verbal
(Russell, 2002), the visual prominence of the placement
(Law & Braun, 2000), and if the placement is involved in
the plot of the story or not (Russell, 2002).
While all these past studies on brand placement have
been informative, research in the area of product place-
ment is still not widespread in the Indian context and is
concentrated on studying the impact of product place-
ments on a wide, general audience. India, which has a
huge and growing section of young consumers who are
poised to begin their consumption journey, offers a big
future growth market for branded products making it
even more important to discover, clarify, and check the
effectiveness of brand placements.
BRAND PLACEMENT IN INDIAN MOVIES
Films are a noticeable medium of entertainment in India
(Panda, 2004), communicating among other things,
the changing fashion trends and promoting market-
er's products and services. Indian audience has always
been emotionally involved with onscreen actors and
the impact is evident from the fact that stars have iconic
status in India. The audience depends heavily on these
actors for setting new trends, fashions, and hairstyles
(Kripalani, 2006), and it was, therefore, not astonishing
when advertisers and marketers started exploiting
mainstream Indian cinema as an opportunity to adver-
tise their products and started relying on stars to set
trends for costumes, accessories, and other products and
services. When the audience watch a movie star with the
product placed in the movie, they connect the product
with the actor, thus, increasing the intrinsic expressive-
ness of the placement messages (Morton & Friedman,
2002) such that when the consumers see the movie star
using a certain product, they try to associate the credi-
bility of the actor with the product placed in the movie
and build a positive behaviour towards the product.
India's popular Hindi film industry, commonly known
as Bollywood, being the largest producer of films in the
world (Minocha & Stonehouse, 2006), is fuelled by a
large audience eager for consumption (Akram, Dwight,
& Muhammad, 2011; Britt, 2002). In addition to the
display of national brands, Hollywood's `big players'
of product placement also appear in Indian movies.
Coca-Cola, for instance, has benefited from placement
in movies in India along with celebrity endorsement
by Indian movie star, Amir Khan, helping it increase
its market share (Business Week, 2003). Display of both
foreign and local brands in the contemporary Indian
films is, therefore, a reflection of the globalization
forces at play within India, with a number of Indian
films being packed with loads of non-Indian product
placements. Since Indian or Hollywood movies mostly
remain unchanged across countries, international
brands, even if placed in local media through cable-
cast or broadcast, may serve as a global marketing
strategy (Gould, Gupta, & Grabner-Krauter, 2000). It is
for this reason that since the last few years, multina-
tional brands have looked to Indian movies to reach the
Indian market (Rajadhyaksha, 2003).
In addition to placing foreign brands in Indian films,
producers of movies have also started exploring different
types of product placements, on the lines similar to its
Hollywood counterpart. Apart from just a brand place-
ment in a movie or a prominent character talking about
it, they have started placing products integral to the sto-
ryline. The 2002 film, Road, shot mostly on roads with the
lead characters driving the cars, featured Tata Motors'
Safari 4-wheel SUV. For this placement, Tata Motors
paid about ` 12.5 million (USD 266,250) (Kripalani,
2006). Such a trend of weaving a product into the sto-
ryline has become common in the Hindi3 film industry
in the past few years. In fact, a recent film Heroine
(2012) included several brands that were integral to the
movie's theme. After the release of the movie, Lakme
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 2 · APRIL-JUNE 2016 153
launched Heroine branded makeup under the Absolute
range, endorsed by Kareena Kapoor (an Indian actress)
while apparel brand Jealous 21 introduced a special
clothing line inspired by the clothes worn by Kareena in
the movie, which narrates the behind-the-scenes life of an
actor. Given the efforts made by the advertisers and the
enthusiasm with which the audiences are accepting brand
placements in the Indian movies, this practice has a huge
potential to grow.
Hypotheses
Brand placements are, by definition, brands placed
within a medium (Nelson & Deshpande, 2013). How
audience members respond to the medium likely
impacts their responses to the brands within that
medium, too. The body of research studying the influ-
ence of context on advertising effectiveness leads to the
finding that advertising context consists of two impor-
tant concepts: receiver context and medium context.
While the receiver context is described as the situa-
tional circumstances in which a person is exposed to
an advertisement (Pieters & Van Raaij, 1992), such as
the person's physical environment (e.g., `at home, at
the dining table'), the social environment (e.g., `in the
company of friends'), the time frame (e.g., `during
lunch'), and the mental state a person is in prior to expo-
sure to the medium content (e.g., `an early morning
mood'), the medium context concerns the environment
of the ad provided by the vehicle carrying it, such as a
television programme, a book, a video game, or a film.
Although studies on context effect are not found in
the brand placement literature, there is some sugges-
tion that the medium context can have an effect on
consumers' responses to an embedded ad (Moorman,
Neijens, & Smit, 2005). Some authors have even found
a congruency effect between context and embedded
ad (priming effect, e.g., Yi, 1990). Therefore, we expect
that the medium context should have an effect on the
responses to brand placements too. Further, while the
medium context may be the same (e.g., films), they may
still differ on the basis of culture, such as films made in
India and abroad, both of which depict widely different
cultures (de Mooij & Hofstede, 2002; Lewis, 2005). In the
present study, we conceptualize and explain the clas-
sification of film industries into foreign film industry
(Hollywood) and domestic film industry (Bollywood),
based on their country of origin and term them as the
film industry context. Films represent a very typical
entertainment medium and each film industry across
the globe is influenced by its culture and environment
as a whole; therefore, understanding of the film
industry context will help understand the differences
between domestic and foreign consumer behaviour. In
the present study, the film industry context has been
used as one of the independent variables that have two
levels, Indian and American. Films that were made in
India have been defined as Indian movies while those
that were made in America have been classified as
American movies.
Until recently, placement of branded products in
movies was considered an American concept (Segrave,
2004). However, the Indian mainstream Hindi films
have caught up with the trend with the Indian audi-
ence not only being exposed to product placement in
different media but also being exposed to it in both the
national and international entertainment industry. Just
as the Indian motion pictures have a huge overseas
market, Hollywood movies is a huge craze with the
Indian masses. With the coming of video-on-demand
and DTH, access to any kind of movies has become
easier than before; therefore, like many other countries,
Hollywood movies have a significant viewership in
India too. Also, interest in Hollywood movies is high,
with several Hollywood movies releasing in Indian
theatres every month. Given the massive exposure of
the Indian audiences to movies, it is a question of legit-
imate curiosity to find out the impact that brand place-
ments in movies have on the audiences.
Hall's (1959) theory aims to explain culture on the basis
of high and low context which varies across cultures
(Hall, 1984). Indian culture, being a high context culture,
aims to communicate messages through symbols
(deMooij, 1998), including brands which may com-
municate the social standing. Hall (1976) also empha-
sizes that in a high-context culture, greater confidence
is placed in the nonverbal aspects of communication
than the verbal aspects. On the other hand, Hollywood
films are rooted in a low-context culture. The literature
on product placement demonstrates that cultural dif-
ferences exist vis-à-vis attitudes towards product place-
ment (Gould et al., 2000; Karrh, Frith, & Gallison, 2001).
This is primarily because cultural values and communi-
cation styles influence advertising persuasion (Aaker &
Maheswaran, 1997) and are also likely to influence the
way consumers process product placements. In other
words, how brand placements communicate is dictated
by the cultural context in which they are put. We argue
that consumers' interpretation of brands placed in dif-
ferent contexts, namely, domestic versus foreign films
will show a potential bias. For example, Coca-Cola has
154 CONSUMER RESPONSE TO BRAND PLACEMENT IN MOVIES: INVESTIGATING THE BRAND-EVENT FIT
been widely used in several international as well as
Indian movies. In each of the two scenarios, the same
brand might be looked at differently due to its place-
ment in two culturally different contexts. An Indian
consumer will be able to relate with Coca-Cola more
in Rang De Basanti (2006), an Indian film, rather than
Coca-Cola in Falling Down (1993). This implies that
differences exist in terms of consumers' response to
brands placed in the two different contexts.
In addition to the difference in consumers' response
to brand placements in national and international
films due to cultural diversity, we also argue, based
on research, that an increase in the number of ads in
the environment will have a negative influence on the
effectiveness of the target ad or the placed brand (Kent,
1995). Given that Hollywood films contain a greater
number of brands overall (Kureshi & Sood, 2011) as
compared to Indian films, it is likely that the reaction
of viewers towards brands placement in Hollywood
movies would be more negative as compared to their
reaction towards brand placement in Indian films. In
view of the literature on the medium context, cultural
differences and the effect of number of brands placed in
a movie, we predict that
H1: Brands placed in a national event will create
more positive brand evaluations than brands placed
in an international event.
Associations between a brand and an event that trigger
positive attitudes towards the brand may be an effec-
tive marketing strategy, leading to increased sales
which could potentially generate a sustainable compet-
itive advantage. However, not all brand­event rela-
tionships result in a positive outcome for the brand.
It has been suggested that when there is congru-
ence between the brand and the event, consumers are
more likely to respond favourably (Hamlin & Wilson,
2004). Meenaghan (2001) explains that perceptions of
congruity reflect the extent to which the sponsored
partner is seen as predictable. Therefore, it is highly
likely that congruence will allow the brand to generate
positive returns, whereas a non-congruent relation-
ship may even be detrimental to the brand (Gray, 2000;
Hamlin & Wilson, 2004; Murphy, 1996; Simmons &
Becker-Olsen, 2006; Welsh, 1999). These studies assume
that congruity between brand and event can have a
positive influence on consumer responses so that there
is a positive attitude towards the event and the brand
(Dousteyssier-Fleck, 2004).
The concept of fit, built on congruity theory (Osgood
& Tannenbaum, 1955), has been extensively applied to
the sponsorship arena and holds that sponsors should
seek events that have a logical congruence or fit with
the sponsors' products. There is, however, no evidence
of congruence/fit studies in the context of product
placements. Nevertheless, given the similarity between
product placement and sponsorship, such that both
consist of a triangular relationship--a company willing
to support a certain activity (the sponsor), a sponsored
activity or the target (the sponsee), and in a majority
of cases also the different media covering the event or
activity (Burnett, 1993)--it is only reasonable to consider
that brands being placed in movies are, in a way, spon-
soring a part of the movie. For example, brands such as
Lakme, Head & Shoulders, Jealous 21, Cera, and so on
collectively spent roughly ` 250 million on in-film place-
ment in the movie Heroine. Therefore, application of fit
in the context of product placement may be built on the
same logic as that in the context of sponsorship.
Sponsorship literature confirms the importance of
congruence on the relationship between brand and
event, exemplified by brand image beliefs (Gwinner &
Eaton, 1999; Speed & Thomson, 2000). Academics and
practitioners have long relied on fit to explain sponsor-
ship (Olson & Thjomoe, 2011; Quester & Thompson,
2001). Simmons and Becker-Olsen (2006) showed that
high-fit sponsorships (sponsor partner is perceived as
congruent with sponsored event) can increase brand
value, whereas low-fit (sponsor partner is perceived
as incongruent with sponsored event) can dilute
brand value. Several studies have shown the impor-
tance of a strong link between the sponsor and the
sponsored event or entity: the greater the perceived fit
of brand associations between the sponsor/endorser
and the brand, the greater the impact on the sponsor's
image and the attitudes towards sponsoring itself
(McDonald, 1991; Smith, 2004). Since attitudes are
found to successfully transfer between parent brands
and brand extensions when perceived fit between
the two is high (Aaker & Keller, 1990), based on the
same argument, it is expected that the degree of fit or
congruence between brands and the context in which
they appear will determine the extent to which atti-
tudes towards the context transfers onto the placed
brand. Additionally, when consumers elaborate on
the sponsorship and discover a level of congruence,
they experience a sense of cognitive satisfaction that
influences their evaluation of the sponsoring brand
(Meyers-Levy & Tybout, 1989).
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 2 · APRIL-JUNE 2016 155
Likewise, strong sponsor­programme congruity sug-
gests that the sponsor's products and activities are
clearly related to the contents of the programme, that is,
the product placement is likely to be natural and con-
sistent with the programme. However, when sponsor­
programme congruity is weak, the product placement
may be seen as inconsistent and not credible. Therefore,
extending this basic finding to brand placement in
movies, we expect that brands that are perceived as
consistent with the event in which they are placed will
lead to positive evaluation of the brand. We therefore
hypothesize that
H2: When the presence of the brand is consistent
with viewer expectations of the event (high fit),
it would create significantly more favourable
consumer evaluations than brands that are incon-
sistent (low fit) with the event.
Foreign films, being viewed by the Indian audiences in
addition to the contemporary Indian films, are sugges-
tive of the global forces within India. Films, being a
product of culture, reflect the cultural values of the
people such that the practices, behaviour, and brands
from other cultures flow into the domestic culture
(Appadurai, 1996). Just as brands are categorized
as foreign or domestic in terms of country of origin,
films, as a medium of entertainment, are also labelled
as foreign and local (Schaefer & Kavita, 2011). When
people are exposed to films, they gather information
from them in terms of brand schemas and compare
them, which determine their judgement with respect
to the appropriateness of the event (McDaniel, 1999).
Therefore, we can assume the same forces to play a
role in consumers' evaluation of films that affect their
judgement about brands. A match leads to more posi-
tive evaluations because affect moves from the event
schema to the brand schema (Perrachio & Tybout, 1996).
However, the influence of films/media on consumers
is not automatic. Consumers in emerging markets, such
as India, may readily accept nonlocal brands due to
country-of-origin (COO) effects where foreign brands
convey quality or status. Conversely, they may reject
foreign brands or their depictions based on consumer
ethnocentrism, that is, preference for one's own coun-
try's products (e.g., Zhou & Russell, 2004).
We hope to examine consumers' responses in terms of
their attitude towards the placed brand and their inten-
tion to purchase the brand within the context of COO
of the event (and not the brand). Given the individual
differenceswithrespecttoforeignanddomesticbrands/
films based on consumer ethnocentrism or openness to
other cultures (Batra et al., 2000), we assume the rela-
tionships of these factors to have an influence on atti-
tudes towards the brand. Past research also suggests
that a congruity between the brand and the context in
which it is placed has an effect on consumers' evalu-
ation. Specifically, a brand­event fit will draw more
favourable responses. Therefore, brand placement and
congruity literature suggests that based on cultural
differences (Gould et al., 2000; Karrh et al., 2001), which
affect the way consumers process product placements
(Aaker & Maheswaran, 1997), a low fit between the
event and the brand is expected to create more positive
evaluation in case of the event being a national event
rather than an international event. Therefore,
H3: The low fit between the brand and the event
will create more favourable evaluation in a national
event context than a low brand­event fit in the
context of an international event.
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
Prior research suggests that the manner in which the
brands are presented in the movies, namely in the
background, used by the main character or as an inte-
gral part of the unfolding story, might lead to different
responses from the audience (Russell, 2002). Therefore,
the current study focused on only one type of brand
placement, that is, the effect of visual brand place-
ments, used by the main character in the movie. Visual
product placement means that the product is shown
prominently in the movie without the mention of the
brand name. For the present study, four different movies
were selected, each using product placement such that
the placement was visual in nature. Second, the study
explored the influence of brand placement using both
American and Indian movies so as to study the effect of
the link between COO of the entertainment event and
brand placement in the movie. For the present study,
four different movies were selected--two American
and two Indian--each using brand placement which
was visual in nature. Experimental design was chosen
as the method of study in the present research work
because of the ability of such designs to test theoretical
relations (Bagozzi & Yi, 1989).
Two pilot studies were conducted prior to the main
experimental study. The participants for all of the studies
were recruited from the same research participant pool
at a large university in North India for no extra credit
for their participation.
156 CONSUMER RESPONSE TO BRAND PLACEMENT IN MOVIES: INVESTIGATING THE BRAND-EVENT FIT
Pilot Study 1: Selection of the Movies for the
Experiment
Ten subjects were asked to list five American and five
Indian (Hindi) movies that used brand placement.
Subjectswereinformedthatused-by-main-characterbrand
placement should be part of the movies and should be
visual brand placement. Used-by-main-character brand
placement involved one of the main characters using
the brand in some manner such as opening the packet of
Tata Tea in the movie, Baghban (2003), by one of the lead
characters in that movie while visual brand placement
was the one in which no mention of the brand name
was made. The subjects were given enough time to
think and were allowed to discuss among themselves.
Pilot Study 2: Fit/Misfit Test
The second pre-test was conducted to select the brand­
event combination. Out of the list of 50 American and
50 Hindi movies generated by the subjects from the
first pre-test, the subjects were asked to separate those
movies where the presence of the brand in the movie
was a misfit in the movie scene and those where the
brand placement and movie scene fitted well. For
doing this, the participants were asked to indicate how
much they considered the brand­event (movie) fit
using a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (complete misfit)
to 7 (complete fit) for each of the movies listed. Using
this data, two American and two Hindi movies were
selected (Table 1) with the most fit and least fit.

The two movies selected with the most brand­event
fit were Top Gun (Ray-Ban) (1986) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan
(Canon) (2012) while the movies selected for the least
brand­event fit were Twilight (2008) and Student of the
Year (2012).
Pilot Study 3: Brand Stature, Brand Perception,
and Brand Familiarity
The third pilot study was conducted to establish if the
three selected brands, namely Ray-Ban, Canon, and
Apple, had the same stature, were similarly perceived,
and had the same level of familiarity. The pre-test was
conducted on 30 participants and analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) results reflect no significant difference
between the three brands, based on stature/importance
(F = 1.45, p = 1.89), perception about the brands
(F = 0.838, p = 0.502), and level of brand familiarity
(F = 1.127, p = 0.343).
Main Study
Design
The study used a 2X2 between-subjects experimental
design with two levels of events (American/Hindi
movies) and two levels of brand­event fit (high fit/low
fit). Each subject was assigned to only one of the four
conditions in the experiment.
Participants
For the purpose of this research, a non-probability
samplingapproachwasused.Non-probabilitysampling
is arbitrary and subjective, due to the fact that a partic-
ipant does not have a known non-zero chance of being
included (Cooper & Schindler, 2006).
The sample chosen for the study was roughly comparable
in terms of occupation (all were post-graduate students),
gender, and age. A total of 120 students participated in
the study (78 females and 42 males) and was drawn from
the subject pool of a large Indian university for no extra
course credit for their participation. The motivation for
this selection was that respondents were thought to be
an appropriate sample since young adults (18 to 24 years
of age) are passionate film-goers. Moreover, attending
movies is a common activity for the age range of the
sample (Nebenzahl & Secunda, 1993). Also, many social
psychological research studies have used college students
as participants but they are usually labelled as `adults'
(Arnett, 2000) who possess enough disposable income to
attend films (Gough, 2003), making product placement in
films an effective way to target young and well-educated
consumers. The 120 respondents were divided into four
groups such that each group consisted of 30 respondents.
Each group was shown one of the four stimuli in the form
of a movie clip and their responses were recorded with a
standardized scale.
Stimulus
Before the final experiment, five respondents (who
were not part of the final study) viewed the four movies
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 2 · APRIL-JUNE 2016 157
which were selected from the pre-tests, on a videotape
to identify and list the names of all the brands placed in
the movie scenes (Table 2).

Since all the movies had numerous brand placements,
we asked the subjects to identify the scenes where only
one brand was placed in a scene. It was also mentioned
that the brand should only be a visual prop being
used by one of the leading characters of the film but
should not be mentioned in the scene. Scenes from the
films, where the branded products were featured, were
selected. Last, the respondents were also asked if the
four movies were comparable in terms of their release
time such that none of the films was either too old or
too new. It was done to avoid the potential confound of
promotional tie-ins and sponsorships that could have
drawn the audience's attention to the brand (Ong &
Meri, 1994).
Also, in order to control for star association with the
brand, those brand placements were not selected for
the final study in which the star of the movie was also
endorsing the brand in traditional advertisements, such
as Kareena Kapoor was seen holding a Sony Vaio in a
scene in Bodyguard (2011) while she is also an endorser
of the same brand and can be seen in television adver-
tisement as well. It was done to avoid clouding the
respondents' judgement based on their assessment of
the celebrity­brand association.
In the brand­event fit for the international event,
Ray-Ban sunglasses worn by the protagonist appears
prominently in the centre of the screen in one scene
from the movie Top Gun (1986). Tom Cruise's char-
acter in the movie, a US Naval Lieutenant Maverick,
embodied the image of a cool jet-fighter pilot, and due
to the natural cosmetic effects and military look of the
sunglasses donned by him in the movie, the brand was
considered to be an overall fit in the movie. The event­
brand misfit condition selected from the American
movie was a scene from the movie Twilight (2008) in
which the female lead of the film was seen working on
an Apple computer. The brand was seen to be a misfit
with the story of the film which was based on a young
adult vampire's romance with a human.
The movie selected from the Indian panorama in the
brand­event fit category was Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012)
in which one of the lead characters of the movie was
a Discovery Channel filmmaker and was seen taking
shots from her Canon camera. The brand seems to fit
perfectly in the movie as the use of the camera is justi-
fied by the character in the film. On the other hand,
the movie Student of the Year (2012) was selected in the
brand­event misfit category. The sunglasses brand
Ray-Ban was being used by one of the male leads whose
character was a boy from a middle-class background
on scholarship, but was seen wearing expensive clothes
and branded sunglasses. The audience took notice of
this apparent disconnect between the character and the
brand and categorized it as a misfit.
Manipulation Check
In order to determine the success of the experimental
design, it was necessary to check whether the manip-
ulation remained hidden or visibly obvious to the
respondents. The present study manipulated fit
between the event and the brand, and this manipula-
tion was checked by measuring the subjects' response
to five items by Speed and Thompson (2000) that
were used to measure brand­event fit in this study
(Table 3). This manipulation check was carried out by
showing the respondents both the high brand­event
fit and low brand­event fit formats. The manipula-
tion check, brand­event fit, was assessed by indexing
two measures, that is, high and low brand fit. Scores
of subjects in the high fit setting (6.3) on a 7-point scale
were compared with the scores of subjects in the low-fit
setting (3.2). The data supports the intended manipula-
tion [F(1, 38) = 5.673, p < 0.05] and confirmed that our
manipulation was effective in creating required experi-
mental conditions.
Research Design
This study was presented as a movie entertainment
study and each session was conducted with 30 partic-
ipants. The methodology adopted for this study is
comparable to the one used by Gupta and Lord (1998).
Subjects participated in small groups. Stimulus tapes
for the four treatment conditions were randomly
assigned to sessions. Upon arrival at the assigned
158 CONSUMER RESPONSE TO BRAND PLACEMENT IN MOVIES: INVESTIGATING THE BRAND-EVENT FIT
experimental session, subjects were informed that
they would be shown a videotape of a movie excerpt
and then asked some questions about the movie. The
participants were informed about the purpose of the
experiment and were allowed to watch the movie clip.
The clips of the movies listed above were edited to 30
minutes. The scenes with the target brand placement
were placed roughly in the middle of each 30-minute
clip and were shown to the subjects.
After watching the movie, subjects completed a ques-
tionnaire measuring demographic information, pre-
vious exposure to the movie, and enjoyment of the
movie they watched. Prior to the testing, respondents
were not made aware that the questionnaire was con-
cerned with product placements in the films. To check
on the cover story, respondents were asked to write
down what they thought was the purpose of the study
immediately after viewing the movie, with none of the
respondents indicating the true purpose.
Respondents completed the questionnaire on brand
evaluation by asking them their attitude towards
the brand and their intention to purchase. Attitude
towards the brand and intention to purchase were
measured using a 7-point scale. The entire task took
approximately 20 minutes. Another personality scale
was given as a distraction task. After this distraction
task, the participants were thanked for their participa-
tion and dismissed from the study.
Variable Operationalization
Several measures were modified from existing vali-
dated scales and in some cases measures were devel-
oped for use in this study based upon the related liter-
ature. All measures were subjected to confirmatory
factor analysis to assess their psychometric properties
and unidimensionality. The final scale items used in the
analysis, standardized factor loadings, and reliability
estimates are listed in Table 3.
Brand­Event Fit/Misfit
In the present study, the event was operationalized as
the appearance of a product in the released film and
the context (national event/international event) of its
appearance. The fit was conceptualized on a variety
of dimensions in the marketing literature. Consistent
with Speed and Thompson (2000), however, we did not
attempt to tease out the different dimensions of fit in
our measure. Rather, we adopted a five-item measure
that allowed respondents to consider fit on their own
terms without restricting the basis used to define fit. The
five items to measure fit, used by Speed and Thompson
(2000), were modified to fit the context of this study
(Table 3). All items on the perception of event­brand fit
were ranked on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = totally disa-
gree, 7 = totally agree).
Understanding brand placements requires that
researchers measure event attendees' (i.e., viewers')
perceptions. The two dependent variables measured
in the study are the attitude towards the brand placed
in the movie and viewers' intention to purchase the
placed brand. The measurement of these constructs has
been summarized below.
Attitude towards the Placed Brand
This construct was measured with a three-item scale
using the traditional attitudinal aspects of liking and
favourable disposition on a 7-point agree­disagree
scale (e.g., Bruner & Hensel, 1992).

Purchase Intention
The behaviour intention measure used in this study
consisted of two items. It allows for a more robust
test of the paths from attitude to purchase intentions.
Responses were operationalized using a 7-point scale
ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.
Before the final administration of the questionnaire,
pre-testing of the questionnaire was carried out for
qualitative investigation. Ten respondents were admin-
istered the questionnaire for this purpose. Subsequently,
the language of one of the questions was simplified.
Before the final data collection, respondents were
briefed about the purpose of the study and all queries
of the respondents were clarified.
RESULTS
A one-way multivariate analysis of variance (one-way
MANOVA) was used to determine whether there were
any significant differences between the independent
groups (brands placed in Indian and American movies)
onthedependentvariables--attitudetowardsthebrand
and intention to purchase. The two dependent varia-
bles were found to be highly correlated with each other
(correlation coefficient is 0.426; p < 0.05) and given the
positive correlation, MANOVA was applied to examine
whether there were differences in the respondents'
attitude towards the placed brand and their intention
to purchase on two different levels of entertainment
event (Indian movies versus international movies).
The multivariate effect (Table 4) was found to be signif-
icant, F
2,115
= 27.915; Wilks' Lambda Value = 0.673; p <
0.05; indicating a statistically significant difference in
brand evaluation based on entertainment event levels
(brands placed in Indian and American movies).
Given the significance of the overall test, the univar-
iate main tests were examined. As indicated in Table 5,
there are significant differences across the levels
of entertainment event, indicating that significant
univariate main effects exist for attitude towards the
placed brand (A
b
), F
1,116
= 9.292, p < 0.05 and inten-
tion to purchase, F
1,116
= 50.067, p < 0.05. Further anal-
ysis indicates that mean scores for `Overall evaluation
of brands appearing in Indian movie' (M = 5.06) and
`Overall evaluation of brands appearing in American
movie' (M = 4.37) are statistically different for two
independent groups (t = 3.08, p < 0.05). It suggests that
entertainment event is significantly predictive of an
increase in the evaluation of brands placed in movies
such that when a brand appears in an Indian movie,
the brand evaluation, measured in terms of A
b
and
purchase intention, is more as compared to when a
brand appears in an American flick. These results indi-
cate an overall support for H1.

160 CONSUMER RESPONSE TO BRAND PLACEMENT IN MOVIES: INVESTIGATING THE BRAND-EVENT FIT
Further analysis using one-way MANOVA reveals that
there is a significant difference in the respondents' A
b
and purchase intention on two levels of brand­event
fit (high fit vs. low fit). The multivariate effect (Table 4)
is significant (F
2.115
= 19.146; p < 0.05). The overall result
suggests that the consumers' evaluation of the brand
placed in the movie varies significantly depending on
the level of fit (high or low) between the brand and the
event, irrespective of the type of event, Indian movies
or international movies. There are significant differ-
ences across the levels of brand­event fit on brand
evaluation indicating that significant univariate main
effects exist for attitude towards the placed brand,
F
1.116
= 6.197, p < 0.05, and intention to purchase, F
1.116
=
34.488, p < 0.05 (Table 5). However, to find out in which
case the respondents evaluated the placed brand more
favourably, mean scores for brand­event fit (M = 5.01)
and brand­event misfit (M = 4.427) were measured and
were found to be statistically different for the two inde-
pendent groups (t = 3.158; p < 0.05). It suggests that
when a brand that fits well with the movie appears,
the brand evaluations, measured in terms of A
b
and
purchase intention, is more favourable as compared to
when a brand does not fit well with the movie. These
results support H2.
Further, a 2X2 (high/low brand­event fit X international
movies/Indian movies) between-subjects MANOVA
was used to determine if there was a significant effect of
brand­event fit and type of event on brand evaluation.
As shown in Table 6, the MANOVAresults reveal signif-
icant main effects of brand­event fit (F
2,115
= 19.146; p
< 0.05) and entertainment event type (F
2,115
= 27.915; p
< 0.05), which indicate that the differences in brand­
event fit are not equal across the event types for both
the dependent variables (A
b
and intention to purchase).
The multivariate effects show that there is a significant
interaction effect of the brand­event fit X event type
interaction term on both the dependent variables (F
2,115
= 5.404; p < 0.05). When an interaction is significant,
the intervening effects of the two independent varia-
bles may obscure comparisons between the means of
one independent variable. In this research, the combi-
nation of the two independent variables played a more
important role in explaining the variability of attitude
towards the brand and intention to purchase.
Additionally, specific mean comparisons (Table 7)
suggest that the effect of brand­event fit on brand
evaluation will be larger when the brand appears
in a national event. A significant difference is found
(t = 4.02; p < 0.001) in A
b
between American (cell mean
= 3.17) and Indian (cell mean = 4.80) movies in a low
brand­event fit condition. It suggests that in a low
brand­event fit condition, brand evaluations will be
more positive in case of an Indian movie than when a
low fit condition occurs in an American movie. Also,
there is a significant difference (t = 3.25; p < 0.001) in
purchase intention in the low brand­event fit condition
for both Hollywood (cell mean = 3.72) and Hindi (cell
mean = 4.92) movies. However, there is no significant
difference (t = 1.89; p < 0.41) in A
b
between Hollywood
(cell mean = 3.91) and Hindi (cell mean = 4.13) movies
when the brand­event fit was high. Also, there is no
significant difference (t = 1.54; p < 0.32) in purchase
intention in the high brand­event fit condition for both
Hollywood (cell mean = 3.89) and Hindi (cell mean =
4.21) movies. Therefore, support is found for H3.

The significant interaction for each dependent variable
is visually demonstrated by the absence of parallelism
of the lines in each of the plots. The `attitude towards
the placed brand' plot (Figure 1a) shows that brands
with low fit with the movie tend to draw lesser posi-
tive attitude towards the placed brand than brands that
fit well with the movie. Also, brands placed in Hindi
movies generated much more positive attitude towards
the placed brand than when brands were placed in
American movies. The interaction effect shows that
although there is little difference in the A
b
when the
brand­event fit is high, the low fit condition leads to
more positive attitude towards the placed brand when
the brand appears in Hindi movies than when the low
brand fit condition appears in Hollywood movies. The
plot of `purchase intention' (Figure 1b) shows similar
results suggesting that intention to purchase is high
when the brand fits well in a Hindi movie while it is
less when the brand is a low fit in a Hollywood movie.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
As one of the first attempts to analyse brand placements
in the context of Hollywood and Hindi movies vis-à-vis
brand fit, this study suggests that the idea of fit, match,
or congruence between the brand and the event can be
used as a key criterion when explaining brand evalu-
ations. Our research takes us one step closer to devel-
oping fitting brand placements, as the study extends the
applicability of the idea of fit, which was till now largely
confined to sponsorship, and subjects it to the explora-
tion of finding a fit between brands and specific events,
in particular, movies. Results of the present study reveal
that such relationships between brand placement and
the outcome variables is linked with another construct,
perceived fit between the brand and the event.
In this context, the purpose of the study was to examine
the extent to which matching the brands and the movies
in which they were placed would succeed in generating
positive consumer responses in terms of positive brand
attitude and intention to purchase the placed brand. The
study also hoped to find out the difference in the effect
of brand placements, if any, based on the context of the
entertainment industry in which they were placed.
Results of this study reveal that brands placed in a
national event, which in this case is Hindi movies,
will create more positive brand evaluations in terms
of positive attitude towards the placed brand and
intention to purchase than brands that are placed in
an international event, that is, American movies. One
can attribute a number of reasons for this result to
be true. The Indian film industry has always been a
reflection of the customs and traditions of the Indian
society (Kripalani, 2006) where the audience has been
expressively involved with onscreen actors, trying
to imitate their styles. A plausible explanation for the
Indian cultural values and communication styles being
an influence on message persuasiveness (Aaker &
Maheswaran, 1997) is that India is a collectivist society
(Hofstede, 2001) where individuals operate as part of
162 CONSUMER RESPONSE TO BRAND PLACEMENT IN MOVIES: INVESTIGATING THE BRAND-EVENT FIT
one or more collectives, such as family or peers. Triandis
(1995) argues that Indians are not just collectivist but
also score high on vertical collectivism, which means
that their desire to stand out from others and admira-
tion of status and celebrity is high (Sivadas, Bruvold, &
Nelson, 2008). As a result of this verticality, individuals
look up to successful people in the hierarchy, such as
movie stars. And, since passion among the Indian audi-
ences for celebrities is no lesser than idol worshipping
(Bhatia, 2000), the impact of such emotional attachment
is that when an actor performs in a film, the audience
wants to emulate their style and image. What it means
in a product placement context is that when a celebrity is
seen communicating explicitly through endorsements or
implicitly through non-verbal or indirect communication,
such as brand placements in movies, the consumers view
the brand to be associated with the celebrity whom they
admire. Without further investigation of the brand, they
make a connection between the film, the actor, the product
and its consumption, and look at product placement as
a perceptual clue which directs behaviour to purchase a
product to satisfy a need or reinforce a social status.
On the other hand, results of the study show that brands
placed in Hollywood were not as successful in gener-
ating positive consumer reactions as brands placed
in Hindi movies. Although, in the product placement
literature, the impact of context effects has not yet been
thoroughly explored, it may be argued that the level of
involvement of the Indian audience with a foreign film,
which may not be very high given the cultural differ-
ences, may have affected the processing of brands tied
to the plot. Brands placed in Hollywood movies may be
at a disadvantage in terms of their being embedded in
a context which is culturally very different from that of
an emerging economy like India. Much like the Indian
film industry, Hollywood movies too are a reflection of
their society. However, unlike India, the US has an indi-
vidualistic culture characterized by individual bene-
fits and preferences, personal success, and independ-
ence. Evidently, brands placed in such a context are less
successful in generating the desired response from an
audience which is culturally more collectivist in nature.
Furthermore, findings of the present research have con-
tributed to an increased understanding of consumers'
reactions to congruity in brand placement literature. In
conjunction with the results of past researches in the
field of brand placement (Nelson & Deshpande, 2013),
this study reveals that when the presence of a brand
is consistent with the context in which it is placed, it
would evoke more positive attitudes and behaviour
than an incongruent placement. Evidently, when people
are faced with incongruity in a message, they begin to
wonder why seemingly disparate elements are paired
together in a message for no apparent reason, leading
to frustration and negative evaluations (Mandler, 1982).
Just as the viewers have become weary of excessive
exposure to advertisements in the traditional medium,
it is feared that unwarranted and obtrusive brand place-
ments that do not fit well with the plot of the movie, is
likely to do more harm than good to the sponsors. Also,
brands that are subtly placed in the movie and those
that are not glaringly forced in the face of the viewer are
considered to enjoy a more fitting relation in the film.
By doing so, the sponsors are not taking the fun out of
the main plot of the movie by focusing too much on
brands placed. The brand, therefore, does not become
the hero of the movie but is strategically made a part of
the scene like a supporting actor.
The direct implication of such a result is that spon-
sors need to be very selective in identifying movies
in which to place their brands. With both, American
and Indian movie business, being multibillion dollar
enterprises where hundreds of movies in all genres are
produced every year (Minocha & Stonehouse, 2006),
it should not be too difficult for sponsors to choose
the right film for brand placement. A brand like Aston
Martin, used by the protagonist in the James Bond
movies, helped the business because the character in
the film clearly identified with the brand. The result
suggests that the connection between the brand and
the film is of significance and needs to be considered
for improving brand evaluations.
Evaluation of results further reveals that although
a brand that fits well with the context in which it is
placed generates a positive evaluation of the placed
brand; the condition of a brand­event misfit in a
Hollywood context will create more negative evalua-
tions among the Indian audiences than if such a discon-
nect appeared in a Hindi film. A study by Kureshi
and Sood (2011) reveals that American films contain a
greater number of brands overall. The likelihood that
all the brands featured in the film will have the same
level of fit with the character and plot of the movie is
not very high. As a result of excessive brands being
placed in the movie, two possible outcomes are likely:
first, viewers will look at the placement as conspicuous;
and second, the misplacement of the brands, if any, in
the film will become prominent. With too many brands
sharing the screen space in a single exposure or spread
out throughout the film, it is likely to draw consumers'
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 2 · APRIL-JUNE 2016 163
attention much more and perhaps more negatively as
too much exposure of brands will lead the viewer to
think of the movie as yet another long commercial.
In the Bollywood context, however, where the brand
placement in movies is still growing as a new medium
of advertising, exposure to brands is relatively less,
leading to lesser chances of a misfit.
Additionally, the reason for a misfit leading to less
adverse brand evaluations in Indian movies as
compared to Hollywood is that while an Indian film
is a three-hour long affair, the Hollywood flicks are of
a much shorter duration. As a result, the brands that
are placed in the Hindi movies are spread over the
entire length of the movie and even if there are times
where the brand is a misfit with the context, it is likely
to be overlooked because of the length of the movie.
The same is not true for Hollywood movies where in
a much shorter window of exposure, the movie carries
a number of brands. And if the brand is perceived to
be disconnected from the film, it is likely to be noticed
more, generating more negative evaluations. It implies
that not only should sponsors be careful in choosing
what type of film to place their brands in, but they
should also put more emphasis on placing brands in
the national entertainment event when trying to reach
the Indian audience. As one of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia,
India, and China) countries, India presents an impor-
tant emerging market with an enormous and affluent
middle-class (Bose, 2006). Ever since the global brands
have been introduced since 1991, Indians have become
consumers of global brands, and thus, India poses to
be a huge market for global brands. Based on the find-
ings of the present study, it is suggested that multina-
tional brands must look at Indian movies as a suitable
medium for reaching out to the prospective buyers.
Contribution to Research
Although brand placement has been vastly researched
in different contexts, the present research has taken
a fresh approach to investigating the effects of brand
placements in national and international entertain-
ment contexts. And the questions, thus, undertaken
to be answered make the research contemporary and
useful for marketers who are faced with the ever
perplexing question of how and when to use brand
placements for greatest effectiveness. Although a few
studies have focused on examining the fit between
brands and movies, fewer have done so in the context
of the Indian film industry and none of the previous
studies focused on exploring consumers' evaluation of
congruent and incongruent brand placements, espe-
cially within Hollywood movies, which have a huge
viewership among the Indian audiences. By studying
the main and interaction effects of fit and entertainment
event type on consumers' brand evaluation, this study
offers useful insights to sponsors who are looking at the
growing India market for their brands by gauging the
way Indian audiences feel about brand placements.
Limitations and Future Research
The present research has advanced our understanding
of the fit between the event and the brand in the inter-
national and national contexts and its role in the frame-
work of brand evaluations. However, the findings of
the present research need to be considered in light of
some limitations. Any study employing student popu-
lation is at risk of external validity shortcomings.
Although the critical role of external validity in research
process is significant (McGrath & Brinberg, 1983), yet
this being a pioneering research study, we placed a
heavier emphasis on the internal validity, which can
be achieved by employing a relatively homogeneous
student sample (Cook & Campbell, 1979). While we
aimed at higher levels of internal validity, we recognize
that a broader and more robust subject pool needs to be
examined before drawing generalizations.
The product placement stimuli were presented outside
of the actual movie context. Viewing several placements
in isolation is an artificial situation and it is not clear
that the effects observed in this research would be repli-
cated in a real film-viewing context. The respondents
surveyed were not aware of the researchers' intention of
testing respondents' perceptions of product placements
in films. The motive behind this was to recreate a natural
viewing environment. Unfortunately, this may have
resulted in many respondents regarding the viewing
session as purely a form of entertainment and, therefore,
failed to notice the placed products in the film clips.
One should also understand that a very narrow stimuli
base was used in the present study where the focus was
only on the visual placement of brands in the scenes.
While used-by-main-character is only one of the types
of brand placements used in movies, it is not the only
one. As such, these results should be verified for other
types of brand placements. In addition, future research
should attempt to include additional factors in exam-
ining relationships investigated in this article. For
example, future researchers may want to find out the
outcome of brand evaluations if the brand is used by
164 CONSUMER RESPONSE TO BRAND PLACEMENT IN MOVIES: INVESTIGATING THE BRAND-EVENT FIT
the villain in the movie and if there will be any effect,
positive or negative, on the brand image.
Also, researchers need to find answers to the relevant
question of what will be the impact on brand place-
ment if multiple brands are a part of the same entertain-
ment show, such as when a number of brands are used
as background props in a movie. An interesting avenue
for future research would also be to examine what
will happen if the character endorsing a brand in the
movie is also a brand ambassador for the same brand
and appears in traditional advertising medium? For
example, Shah Rukh Khan in Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani
(2000) is seen driving a Hyundai car of which he is also
the brand ambassador and can be seen endorsing the
brand in TV ads as well.
Finally, it is necessary to investigate the extent to which
placement findings do not generalize across mediums.
For example, consumers may be more tolerant of
product placements in television because broad-
cast television is an advertising-supported medium.
Thus, differences in television and film viewing habits
(Russell & Stern, 2006) may also alter the factors that
drive the success of brand placements. Studies exam-
ining the results of this study with different samples
and in different settings are certainly another appro-
priate direction for future research.
