Homocysteine, Estrogen Status in NHANES III Morris et al.
Total Homocysteine and Estrogen Status Indicators in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Martha Savaria Morris, Paul F. Jacques, Jacob Selhub, and Irwin H. Rosenberg
The possibility that estrogen status modulates total homocysteine concentration, a risk factor for vascular
occlusion, was examined in a representative sample of the US population, the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (phase 2), 1991­1994. The geometric mean serum total homocysteine
concentration was compared among population subgroups differing on inferred estrogen status, after adjusting
for potential confounding by age, race-ethnicity, smoking, and the serum concentration of creatinine, folate, and
vitamin B-12. Premenopausal women aged 17­54 years had a lower mean serum total homocysteine
concentration (8.1 µmol/liter, 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.9, 8.2) than men in the same age range (8.9
µmol/liter, 95% CI: 8.6, 9.3). In the age range 17­44 years, pregnant women (6.0 µmol/liter, 95% CI: 5.4, 6.8),
but not oral contraceptive users (7.9 µmol/liter, 95% CI: 7.6, 8.2), had a lower mean serum total homocysteine
concentration than nonpregnant, non-oral-contraceptive-using women (8.1 µmol/liter, 95% CI: 7.9, 8.2). The
mean serum total homocysteine concentration of estrogen-using women aged 55 years (9.5 µmol/liter, 95%
CI: 8.9, 10.1) was significantly decreased relative to nonestrogen users (10.7 µmol/liter, 95% CI: 10.3, 11.1) and
men (10.4 µmol/liter, 95% CI: 9.8, 11.0) in the same age range. These findings suggest that higher estrogen
status is associated with a decreased mean serum total homocysteine concentration, independent of nutritional
status and muscle mass, and that estrogen may explain the previously reported male-female difference in total
homocysteine concentration. Am J Epidemiol 2000;152:140­8.

Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing amino acid whose
presence at high concentration in serum or plasma has been
associated with vascular occlusion (1, 2). Male-female dif-
ferences in circulating homocysteine concentration have
been reported (3­7), but lower concentrations in females
may be characteristic of the premenopausal years only
(3­5). Young women have lower rates of occlusive vascular
disease than do young men, but the male-female gap nar-
rows later in life (5). A possible cause is the decline in estro-
gen production that accompanies menopause, with a con-
comitant rise in homocysteine. Findings supportive of this
hypothesis include reports of markedly reduced plasma
homocysteine concentrations in pregnant versus nonpreg-
nant women (8), lower homocysteine concentrations in
users of oral contraceptives versus nonusers (9), an increase
in circulating homocysteine concentration after age 50 years
that is steeper in females than in males (4, 10), and reduc-
tion of both homocysteine concentration and vascular dis-
ease risk in estrogen-treated postmenopausal women (11).
Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) provide a unique opportu-
nity to explore the variation of homocysteine concentration
with estrogen status in a large representative sample of the gen-
eral US population, across a broad spectrum of ages. Our ear-
lier analyses of NHANES III data confirmed in the US popu-
lation male-female differences in homocysteine concentration
from adolescence on, as well as an abrupt increase in homo-
cysteine concentration in women after age 50 years that may
indicate an effect of menopause (4). These findings suggest the
hypothesis that estrogen status modulates homocysteine con-
centration, but the sex difference could also be attributable to
male-female differences in muscle mass (7) or nutritional sta-
tus (12). In this report, we address the estrogen hypothesis
specifically by stratifying women according to available indi-
cators of estrogen status and performing comparisons of
homocysteine concentration among women of higher inferred
estrogen status, women of lower inferred estrogen status, and
men. These comparisons are performed after controlling for
alternative explanations for between-group differences, such as
serum vitamin levels, markers of muscle mass, and age.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample population
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics,
Homocysteine, Estrogen Status in NHANES III 141
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 2, 2000
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, obtained
nationally representative data on the health and nutritional
status of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population
through interviews and direct physical examinations (13,
14). Toward this goal, some population subgroups, includ-
ing young children, older persons, Blacks, and Mexican
Americans, were oversampled. All respondents gave their
informed consent, and the NHANES III protocol was
reviewed and approved by the National Center for Health
Statistics' National Health and Nurition Examination
Survey Institutional Review Board.
Homocysteine concentrations were measured as an
NHANES III (phase 2), 1991­1994, surplus sera project on
serum samples derived from participants aged 12 years. All
sample members were invited to undergo a physical exami-
nation that included phlebotomy. Of the 13,635 phase 2 sam-
ple members aged 12 years, 10,280 responded to the invita-
tion to be examined, and homocysteine measurements were
obtained for 8,585 (64 percent). Missing homocysteine mea-
surements for examined individuals resulted from the failure
to obtain a blood sample or from a lack of surplus sera.
Homocysteine measurement
Blood was drawn and processed in mobile examination
centers under controlled, constant environmental conditions
according to a standard protocol (15). Participants had
fasted for varying lengths of time, but analyses demon-
strated that length of fast had no measurable effect on homo-
cysteine concentrations. Whole blood, which was not
treated with anticoagulant, was collected in serum separator
tubes and was held at room temperature for 30­60 minutes
before centrifugation. Sera were separated, frozen at ­20°C,
and transferred on dry ice to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention's central laboratory for priority analyses.
Samples went through 1­4 freeze-thaw cycles. After prior-
ity analyses were completed, additional analyses were car-
ried out subject to approval by the Surplus Sera Bank
Steering Committee. The surplus sera were stored at ­70°C
for 8 months to 3 years before being analyzed for total
homocysteine concentration. Plasma samples frozen for up
to 10 years have been shown to be acceptable for character-
izing a person's plasma total homocysteine concentration at
the time the samples were drawn (16). Serum total homo-
cysteine concentration refers to the combined concentration
in serum of trace amounts of the free amino acid homocys-
teine, oxidized disulfides comprising a molecule of homo-
cysteine bound to a molecule of another sulfur-containing
amino acid (about 30 percent), and protein-bound homocys-
teine (about 70 percent) (2). The serum total homocysteine
concentration was measured by the high-performance liquid
chromatography method of Araki and Sako (17) at the US
Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research
Center on Aging after approval by the New England
Medical Center Human Investigations Review Committee.
Subject classification
For data analyses, subjects were first stratified by age and
then by inferred estrogen status within age group. Age
groups corresponded to the years near menarche (ages
12­16 years), the childbearing years (ages 17­44 years), the
perimenopausal years (ages 45­54 years), middle age (ages
55­69 years), and old age (70 years). The question of inter-
est for each age range concerned whether the geometric
mean serum total homocysteine concentration varied
according to estrogen status. Estrogen measurements were
not available, however, and estrogen status was inferred
from sex, serum concentration of follicle-stimulating hor-
mone, where available, and interview responses regarding
various aspects of reproductive history (table 1).
Classification of women <35 years of age relative to
menarche, premenopause, or postmenopause (excluded)
was based on self-report. Girls under 17 years old were
asked how old they were when their menstrual periods
started to occur, and a possible response was "Haven't
started yet." Those who gave an age were classified as
"postmenarche"; those who said their periods had not
started yet were classified as "premenarche."
Women 17 years old were classified as pregnant under
the following two circumstances: 1) if they said they were
pregnant in response to a specific interview item and 2) if a
urine pregnancy test (given to examined women aged 20­49
years) gave a positive result. Use of estrogen supplements
and oral contraceptives was defined as self-report of current
use (dose information was not available). Women in the age
range 17­34 years who provided menstrual histories and did
not report either a double oophorectomy or the combination
of at least 3 months of amenorrhea and a single oophorec-
tomy were considered premenopausal. Ninety-five percent
of those considered premenopausal reported that their last
menstrual period had occurred <2 months prior to the inter-
view. Of the 74 women aged 17­34 years who were consid-
ered premenopausal and had reported that their last men-
strual period had occurred 2 months prior to the interview,
eight had had surgery to remove the uterus but not the
ovaries, 28 had been pregnant during the year prior to the
interview or were breastfeeding at interview, 21 had had a
menstrual period within 3 months of the interview, and one
had apparently unexplained amenorrhea for a year prior to
the interview but had been pregnant within 2 years of the
interview. Only three of the remaining 16 had a body mass
index between 19 and 26 kg/m2 (for six subjects, the body
mass index was >40; for two, it was <18), but seven of the
16 had menstruated within 6 months of the interview, and
another two had menstruated within a year of the interview.
Serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone
were used to classify women aged 35­54 years as either
"premenopausal" (follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)  35
IU/liter) or "postmenopausal" (FSH > 35 IU/liter). All
women aged 55 years and older were considered post-
menopausal unless the follicle-stimulating hormone concen-
tration was available and 35 IU/liter. For 90 of the 1,404
women aged 55 years, neither the reproductive history nor
the follicle-stimulating hormone concentration was avail-
able. However, the follicle-stimulating hormone concentra-
tion was missing for only one woman aged 55­60 years.
Furthermore, only three of 198 women aged 61­65 years
reported that they had menstruated in the past 2 years.

Statistical analysis
To account for the complex NHANES III survey design
(i.e., a staged sampling scheme and unequal probability of
selection and nonresponse), data were analyzed using
SUDAAN statistical software (18), and sample weights
were incorporated into analytical procedures. Because total
homocysteine concentrations were extremely skewed, the
values were logarithmically transformed before being used
in data analyses. The SAS system (19) was used to create
and manipulate the data files. A p < 0.05 was considered sta-
tistically significant for all analyses.
Preliminary data analyses accomplished two goals: 1) the
description of subjects stratified by age group and inferred
estrogen status as to sociodemographic characteristics, body
composition indicators, and status as to vitamin B-12, folate,
and cigarette smoking; and 2) the evaluation of univariate
relations between these factors and the two main variables
of interest--the serum total homocysteine concentration and
estrogen status category. All of these variables were consid-
ered potential confounders of the relation between serum
total homocysteine concentration and estrogen status based
on one or more of the following three criteria: 1) relation to
total homocysteine concentration demonstrated in previous
studies (i.e., age, creatinine, vitamin B-12, folate, and ciga-
rette smoking), 2) consistent consideration as a potential
total homocysteine correlate in previous studies (i.e., body
mass index), or 3) status as a major sociodemographic char-
acteristic not previously well studied (i.e., race-ethnicity).
Depending on the scale of the potentially confounding vari-
able (i.e., continuous or categorical), linear regression
(SUDAAN PROC REGRESS) or cross-tabulation
(SUDAAN PROC CROSSTAB) procedures were used to
perform the two preliminary data analytical functions.
Means were compared via F tests; contingency tables were
analyzed via chi-square tests.
Although smoking data were collected from all subjects,
in the age group <17 years, only seven subjects, none of
whom was in the premenarche category, were regular pack-
a-day smokers. Consequently, potential confounding by

smoking in this age group was handled by the elimination of
the seven regular smokers from data analyses. An additional
157 subjects in various age ranges were excluded from data
analyses because of missing information on potential con-
founders. Women were excluded from data analyses if
insufficient data were collected to infer their estrogen status
(n  37). NHANES III participants excluded for this reason
included one subject aged <17 years, 34 subjects aged
17­44 years, and two subjects aged 45­54 years. Female
NHANES III participants in estrogen status categories that
were rare in a particular age range but common in another
age range were also excluded. More specifically, we
excluded pregnant girls aged <17 years (n  6), apparently
postmenopausal women aged 17­44 years (n  74), and
apparently premenopausal women aged 55 years (n  21).
The final proportion of the phase 2 sample members
included in data analyses was 61 percent (n  8,384).
The relation between the serum total homocysteine con-
centration and the estrogen status category was analyzed via
multiple linear regression analysis using SUDAAN PROC
REGRESS. Point estimates and 95 percent confidence inter-
vals of the geometric mean (inverse of the logarithmic
mean) total homocysteine concentration were calculated for
various estrogen status categories from the least-square
means and standard errors generated by the regression pro-
cedure. Three separate models were run to adjust for poten-
tially confounding factors. The basic model included age (to
adjust for any residual confounding by age within age strata)
and race-ethnicity. The intermediate model included the
basic model variables plus cigarette smoking, body mass
index, and serum creatinine. The full model included the
intermediate model variables plus serum concentrations of
vitamin B-12 and folate. We explored possible effect modi-
fication by race-ethnicity, cigarette smoking, and vitamin
status by including appropriate interaction terms individu-
ally in the full model. Initially, means and 95 percent confi-
dence intervals were reported without regard to possible
effect modifiers. However, after the serum folate concentra-
tion was identified as a modifier of the effect of sex on the
serum total homocysteine concentration at ages consistent
with women's childbearing years, the folate distribution for
that age range was divided into fifths, and confounder-
adjusted mean serum total homocysteine concentrations and
associated 95 percent confidence intervals were generated
for premenopausal women and men separately for each of
the five serum folate categories.

serum concentrations of folate and vitamin B-12.
Furthermore, in most age strata, a higher age within the age
category was associated with a higher serum total homocys-
teine concentration.
In the age range <17 years, the 68 girls who had not yet
passed menarche were different in several ways from boys
(n  410) and from girls that had passed menarche (n 
422). Specifically, the premenarcheal girls tended to be of
younger age, higher folate status, and lower body mass
index, and they had lower serum creatinine concentrations.
In the age range 17­44 years, pregnant women (n  135)
and users of oral contraceptives (n  366) were younger
than subjects in other estrogen status categories. Men in this
age range (n  1,764) were more likely to smoke than were
women in all subgroups. Oral contraceptive users had a
lower body mass index than subjects in other subgroups and,
compared with other nonpregnant women (n  1,751) and
men, they were of lower vitamin B-12 status and more likely
to be non-Hispanic White. Pregnant women were of higher
folate status than subjects in the other subgroups.
In the age range 45­54 years, women who were post-
menopausal (n  168) or receiving estrogen replacement
therapy (n  87) were older than other women (n  219)
and men (n  354). Women in this age range tended to
smoke less than the men, but only the premenopausal
women smoked statistically significantly less. Finally, estro-
gen users were of somewhat higher folate status than were
members of other subgroups.
In the age range 55­69 years, estrogen users (n  103)
differed from members of other subgroups; they were statis-
tically significantly younger than non-estrogen-using post-
menopausal women (n  562), and they were of higher
folate status and more likely to be non-Hispanic White than
both the other women and the men (n  638).
Among NHANES III participants aged 70 years, non-
estrogen-using postmenopausal women (n  670) were
older than the men (n  524), but estrogen-using women
(n  48) were not. Elderly estrogen users were of somewhat
higher folate status than the other women and the men, but
in this age range, it was the non-estrogen-using women who
had the highest serum vitamin B-12 concentrations.
Estrogen users in this age range were statistically signifi-
cantly less likely to smoke than were members of the other
subgroups and, similar to the middle-aged estrogen users,
they were more likely than members of the other subgroups
to be non-Hispanic White.
To summarize, each one of the potentially confounding
factors was statistically significantly related to inferred
estrogen status in at least one age stratum, and all but body
mass index were statistically significantly related to serum
total homocysteine concentration in at least one age stratum.
The basic multivariate model (table 3) revealed no statis-
tically significant difference in the serum total homocys-
teine concentration between girls who had and had not
passed menarche, but the menstruating girls alone had lower
total homocysteine concentrations than the boys. In the age
range 17­44 years, the total homocysteine concentrations of
women, whether or not they were oral contraceptive users,
were significantly lower than those of men, and the total
homocysteine concentrations of pregnant women were sig-
nificantly lower than those of not only the men but also the
nonpregnant women.
The total homocysteine concentrations of women aged
45­54 years in all estrogen status categories were lower than
those of the men. Significant differences were also found
between women who were either premenopausal or receiv-
ing estrogen replacement therapy and those who were post-
menopausal but not receiving estrogen therapy. Results were
similar for older men and women.
Changes from the basic to the intermediate model
resulted mainly from the inclusion of a term for serum cre-
atinine in the model, which tended to bring the means for
men and women closer together. Nevertheless, the total
homocysteine concentrations of premenopausal women,
pregnant women, and women receiving estrogen replace-
ment therapy continued to be significantly lower than those
of the men.
Addition of terms for serum concentrations of folate and
vitamin B-12 to the multivariate model resulted in some-
what higher mean total homocysteine estimates for preme-
narcheal girls, pregnant women, estrogen users, and all cat-
egories of elderly subjects. However, the between-group
differences noted with simpler models tended to be main-
tained. To summarize, the serum total homocysteine con-
centrations of menstruating women in all age ranges were
lower than those of comparably aged men. Furthermore, in
those age ranges that included postmenopausal women, the
means of postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen
replacement therapy were comparable with those of men
and higher than those of women taking estrogen supple-
mentation. Finally, among women in their childbearing
years, pregnant women had serum total homocysteine con-
centrations that were much lower than those of subjects in
all other estrogen status categories, but the serum total
homocysteine concentrations of oral contraceptive users
were indistinguishable from those of other nonpregnant
women of reproductive age.
The between-group differences we found were not modi-
fied by race-ethnicity, cigarette-smoking status, or vitamin
B-12 status. Serum folate status did affect the total homo-
cysteine advantage of premenopausal women over men,
however. More specifically, when men of low folate status
aged 17­44 years were compared with premenopausal
women who were also of low folate status, the serum total
homocysteine concentrations of the men and women were
very similar (figure 1). When men and premenopausal
women of higher folate status were compared, however,
their serum total homocysteine concentrations differed.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study show that a sex difference in
muscle mass, as reflected by the serum creatinine concen-
tration, partially explains the higher serum total homocys-
teine concentrations of men as compared with women.
Furthermore, the high nutritional status of hormone users
contributes to the comparatively low serum total homocys-
teine concentrations of postmenopausal women receiving
Homocysteine, Estrogen Status in NHANES III 145

estrogen replacement therapy. Nevertheless, when these
confounding factors were controlled for, three differences
suggestive of an effect of estrogen status on the serum total
homocysteine concentration were observed: 1) the serum
total homocysteine concentrations of premenopausal
women of all ages were statistically significantly lower than
those of comparably aged men; 2) pregnant women had
extremely low serum total homocysteine concentrations;
and 3) elderly estrogen users showed a total homocysteine
advantage over elderly postmenopausal women who were
not receiving estrogen replacement therapy.
Unlike estrogen supplementation, oral contraceptive use
appeared to have no effect on the serum total homocysteine
concentration, a finding that has been obtained by others
(20, 21). van der Mooren et al. (22) have pointed out that
contemporary oral contraceptives usually contain low doses
of synthetic estrogens, whose effects may be different from
those of natural estrogens. Another factor to keep in mind is
that oral contraceptives are used by women of childbearing
age, whose estrogen status is already high. Whether oral
contraceptive use would offer an advantage to elderly
women is unknown.
That pregnant women have very low circulating homo-
cysteine concentrations has long been known (8). Walker et
al. (23) recently found that folate supplementation in preg-
nancy contributed to the low levels, but we showed that the
high folate status of pregnant women did not entirely
explain the difference between pregnant and nonpregnant
women. Although pregnant women have higher estrogen
levels than men and nonpregnant women, their condition is
unique in many other ways that might account for their low
serum total homocysteine concentrations. Walker et al. (23)
suggested that homocysteine levels may decrease in preg-
nancy because of utilization by the fetus, a hypothesis raised
by the observation of a decreasing plasma total homocys-
teine gradient from the maternal vein to the umbilical vein
to the umbilical artery. On the basis of animal studies, Kim
et al. (24) hypothesized that cortisol, which rises during
pregnancy, might also contribute.
Our findings regarding a possible effect of menopause on
total homocysteine concentrations were consistent with those
of Wouters et al. (25), who found higher plasma homocys-
teine concentrations in postmenopausal versus pre-
menopausal women in a comparison that could not exclude
age as a possible explanation for the difference. That study
also demonstrated a negative association between serum
concentrations of 17-estradiol and postmethionine plasma
homocysteine among the 46 premenopausal subjects. A
Swedish population-based study of men and women aged
35­95 years (7) revealed stable plasma total homocysteine

concentrations in women from the age range 35­49 years to
the age range 50­64 years but rapidly increasing concentra-
tions thereafter. Men's total homocysteine concentrations, on
the other hand, increased with each successively higher age
range. These results were similar to those reported from our
group's earlier analyses of NHANES III data (4). Brattstrom
et al. (7) concluded that homocysteine values did not
increase with age in women in a manner that suggested an
effect of menopause. However, our results and those of
Brattstrom et al. could be interpreted as indicating that
women's total homocysteine concentrations, unlike men's,
are kept from rising until an age range when all of the women
would have passed menopause. Both the data from
Brattstrom et al. (7) and our results from the current investi-
gation showed that, after the age of menopause, any differ-
ence in total homocysteine concentration between men and
at least non-estrogen-using women was accounted for by the
higher serum creatinine concentrations of men. An analysis
of the Framingham study data attributed a male-female dif-
ference in total homocysteine concentration observed among
elderly cohort members to a sex difference in B-vitamin sta-
tus (12), but neither the serum creatinine concentration nor
postmenopausal estrogen use was considered in that study.
Both a descriptive study recently completed by our group
(26) and a study of Belgian school-age children (21) sought
to provide reference ranges for circulating total homocys-
teine concentration in children and adolescents. To our
knowledge, ours was the first attempt to specifically link
menarche to the onset of male-female differences, however.
Authors of the Belgian study reported a sex difference in
plasma total homocysteine concentration among subjects
aged 15­19 years but not in younger age ranges. The
NHANES III data revealed statistically significant male-
female differences in all age ranges, but the two studies
were not completely comparable. The next younger age
range of Belgian children to the age range 15­19 years
included boys and girls as young as 10 years, 2 years
younger than the youngest NHANES III participants whose
total homocysteine concentrations were measured. While
the age range 10­14 years certainly included girls who had
not passed menarche, we identified only 68 female
NHANES III participants who had not begun to menstruate,
and some of those were undoubtedly on the verge of menar-
che. Taken together, results of the Belgian study and our
finding of a clear male-female difference only between boys
and menstruating girls aged <17 years remain suggestive of
an effect of menarche, but further study is needed.
We found that the total homocysteine advantage to pre-
menopausal women versus similarly aged men was
restricted to a subgroup with higher folate status. On the
other hand, the total homocysteine benefit enjoyed by
elderly estrogen users over other postmenopausal women
did not seem to be affected by folate status. Data graphed in
figure 1 showed that the benefit of being a premenopausal
woman was realized at serum folate concentrations other
than those consistent with folate deficiency (serum folate
concentration < 6.8 nmol/liter) or very low folate status. The
20th percentile of the folate distribution of women aged 70
years (the age range for which estrogen users had lower
serum total homocysteine concentrations than non-estrogen
users) was 10.2 nmol/liter, and only five estrogen users had
concentrations that low. Our data thus did not permit an
analysis of the effect of folate deficiency or very low folate
status on the relation between estrogen supplementation and
the serum total homocysteine concentration.
Several mechanisms have been hypothesized for estro-
genic effects on homocysteine metabolism. Boers et al. (5)
have suggested that methionine may be catabolized more in
premenopausal women than men by a methionine transami-
nation pathway that does not result in homocysteine accu-
mulation. In support of their hypothesis, this team of inves-
tigators reported higher concentrations of transamination
metabolites in premenopausal women versus young men
(6). How estrogen per se might stimulate the transamination
pathway (as opposed to the well-known transsulfuration
pathway) has yet to be suggested nor has transamination
activity been demonstrated to differ between pre- and post-
menopausal women or between estrogen-supplemented and
nonsupplemented postmenopausal women. Animal studies
have supported the notion that estrogen might prevent
hyperhomocysteinemia through increased methionine syn-
thase activity in the kidney (24), and Boers et al. (5) have
pointed out that the noted variation in homocysteine con-
centration with estrogen status could also be explained by
variation in transsulfuration or renal excretion rates.
This study had many strengths. Among them were the
very large sample size, the broad age range of the subjects,
the representation by the sample of the US population, the
several estrogen status categories that could be distin-
guished, the data on follicle-stimulating hormone (used as
Homocysteine, Estrogen Status in NHANES III 147
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 2, 2000
an indicator of menopause in the perimenopausal age
range), and our ability to control for several potentially con-
founding factors.
The chance for information bias to have affected the
results was minimal given our infrequent reliance on other
than blood data for assessment of status as to the dependent
variable, independent variables, and possible confounders of
the relation between the two. We used menstrual histories
provided by female subjects for assessment of menopausal
status, but only in an age range when being postmenopausal
would be unlikely. We included as "premenopausal" some
young women with unexplained amenorrhea who may have
been of low estrogen status; however, excluding these
women from analyses had no effect on results. Hormone use
was entirely self-reported, but reports were likely to be
accurate, especially since current use was of interest.
Among potential confounders, only smoking status, age,
and race-ethnicity were reported by the subjects.
Despite the study's strengths, we cannot definitively
attribute the observed differences to estrogen without actual
estrogen measurements. On the other hand, no known
homocysteine correlate was left uncontrolled. Three vari-
ables we considered in addition to those controlled for in the
full multivariate model were region of the country, urban-
rural character, and season when the examinations and inter-
views took place. Adding terms for these factors to the full
multivariate model had no effect on the results.
The response rate for homocysteine measurements was 64
percent, and a small number of additional subjects were lost
because of missing information on estrogen status indicators
or potentially confounding factors. Comparisons between
subjects included in the data analyses and interviewed sub-
jects excluded for missing information revealed few differ-
ences; however, included subjects were younger and less
likely to have had a heart attack than subjects who were
merely interviewed. Both heart attacks and age are related to
total homocysteine concentration (1, 2, 4), and physicians'
prescription of estrogen could be related to heart attack his-
tory. It is thus reassuring that results did not change when
analyses were restricted to those who had not had heart
attacks or strokes. Also relevant to the difference we found
between estrogen users and nonusers is the consistency of that
finding with results of small clinic investigations (22, 27), one
large uncontrolled study (28), and a controlled trial (29). After
reviewing these studies, van der Mooren et al. (11) recently
concluded that homocysteine concentrations can be reduced
by postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy. Oral estro-
gen was also found to be effective in reducing the circulating
homocysteine concentrations of 22 elderly men (30).
This study was the first to look at indicators of estrogen
status through the majority of the life cycle in a large popu-
lation-based study, and results were generally consistent
with the hypothesis that estrogen status is inversely related
to the circulating total homocysteine concentration. Future
investigators of this relation should attempt to link actual
estrogen measurements to total homocysteine measurements
and to specific metabolic pathways that might result in
decreased homocysteine production or increased homocys-
teine clearance from the circulation.
