Abstract
Detailed characterization of estrogen dynamics during
the transition to menopause is an important step toward
understanding its potential implications for reproduc-
tive cancers developing in the transition years. We
conducted a 5-year prospective study of endogenous
levels of total and unopposed estrogen. Participants
(n = 108; ages 25-58 years) collected daily urine speci-
mens for 6 months in each of 5 consecutive years.
Specimens were assayed for estrone-3-glucuronide
(E1G) and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide. Linear mixed-
effects models were used to estimate exposure to total
and unopposed estrogen by age and reproductive stage.
Reproductive stage was estimated using menstrual
cycle length variance. E1G mean area under the curve
and mean E1G 5th and 95th percentiles represented
total estrogen exposure. An algorithm identifying days
of above-baseline E1G that coincided with the days of
baseline pregnanediol-3-glucuronide was used to iden-
tify days of unopposed estrogen. Mean E1G area under
the curve increased with age in the pretransition and
early transition and decreased in the late transition.
Ninety-fifth percentile E1G levels did not decline until
after menopause, whereas 5th percentile levels declined
from the early transition to the postmenopause. The
number of days of unopposed estrogen was significant-
ly higher during the transition compared with the
pretransition. Given the length of time women spend
in the transition, they are exposed to more total and
unopposed estrogen than has been previously appreci-
ated. Coupled with epidemiologic evidence on lifetime
exposure to estrogen, these results suggest that variation
in the amount of time spent in the transition may be an
important risk factor for reproductive cancers. (Cancer

Introduction
Recent data show that, among both White and Black
women, age-specific incidence rates of malignant cancers
of the breast, ovaries, and endometrium rise through the
perimenopausal years up to at least age 60 years (1).
Substantial evidence supports an association of endoge-
nous reproductive hormone exposure with increased risk
of reproductive cancers (2-4). Greater estrogen exposure,
assessed via indirect indicators such as number of years
spent having menstrual cycles (e.g., ref. 5) or direct
indicators such as hormone measures (e.g., ref. 6), is
associated with increased risk for cancers of the breast and
ovary (3, 7, 8). Similarly, exposure to estrogen unopposed
by progesterone is a risk factor for endometrial and
ovarian cancers (8). The precise mechanism by which
estrogen contributes to reproductive cancers is not known,
but etiologic theories highlight the role of estrogen in cell
proliferation in the endometrium and breast and epithelial
repair of the ovary following ovulation (3, 7-10).
Erratic estrogen secretion is characteristic of the
perimenopausal years (11) and may be an important
source of risk for reproductive cancers. However, the
perimenopause, which may last several years (12), has
not been explicitly considered in studies of hormones
and reproductive cancers. Hale et al. (13) recently
emphasized Pike's (14) suggestion that the perimeno-
pausal years constitute an important ``window of risk''
for endometrial cancer. These years may also be an
important window of risk for other estrogen-related
cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancers (15), as well
as for the increased likelihood of uterine fibroids,
endometrial hyperplasia, dysfunctional uterine bleeding,
and progression of endometriosis symptoms observed in
the perimenopause (16). Thus, detailed characterization
of estrogen dynamics during the perimenopause is
important for understanding its potential implications
for reproductive cancers and other health outcomes.
Menstrual cycle length changes as women make the
transition to menopause. On average, cycles become
longer and more variable with increasing proximity to
menopause (17). Compared with the hormonal patterns
of the prime reproductive years, the transition to
menopause is associated with increased variability in
estrogen and progesterone patterns (11, 18, 19). Previous

studies have documented higher (20-24), lower (25-30),
or unchanged (31-35) estrogen levels in older or
perimenopausal women compared with younger or
premenopausal women. In recent work, we found that
individual-level urinary estrone-3-glucuronide (E1G)
increased from 25 to 45 years and then declined in the
late 40s for most women (36). These disparate results
arise because of (a) differences among studies in the
timing of sampling, sample selection or sample size, and
study design, (b) erratic fluctuations in hormone levels
confounding comparisons during the perimenopause,
and (c) use of age as an anchor for comparisons among
women: aggregate estrogen patterns can mask hormonal
trajectories that individual women actually experience as
they age (36).
Thus, it remains unclear whether women are exposed
to more or less overall estrogen during the perimeno-
pause compared with the prime reproductive years.
Here, we examine estrogen trajectories for individual
women across reproductive stages (37). We estimate total
and unopposed estrogen exposure by stage while
controlling for age and body mass index (BMI).
Materials and Methods
Participants. Data were collected as part of the
Biodemographic Models of Reproductive Aging
(BIMORA) project (36). Participants were recruited from
the Tremin Research Program on Women's Health
(TREMIN; ref. 38). Participants included women aged
between 25 and 60 years, not using prescription
reproductive hormones, and who had at least one intact
ovary. Pregnant or breastfeeding women and women
receiving cancer treatment were not eligible. Monetary
compensation was provided for participation. All sub-
jects provided written informed consent, and all proce-
dures were approved by the institutional review boards
of the University of Utah, Pennsylvania State University,
Georgetown University, and University of Washington.
Data Collection. First morning urine specimens and
information on menstrual bleeding were collected daily
from January 15 to July 14 of each year from 1998 to 2002.
Daily information was collected on major medical
conditions and treatments and over-the-counter and
prescription medication. Most participants continued to
record menstrual bleed data on calendar cards for
TREMIN. We combined the TREMIN bleed data for July
15 to January 14 with the BIMORA data for January 15 to
July 14 for each project year from 1998 to 2001; for 2002,
we have only BIMORA bleed data.
Height and weight for BMI come from a 2000 self-
administered health survey, at the midpoint of the study.
BMI was available for the year 2000 for 90 of the 108
women included in the analyses. For the remaining 18
women, we used all available BMI data from previous
years for each woman in a linear mixed-effects model of
BMI by year and used the estimated model fits to impute
a 2000 value. The mean (SD) and median BMI for the
sample of 108 women was 24.2 (5.1) and 23.2 kg/m2,
respectively. Seventy percent of the BMIs were <25
(normal), 18% fell between 25 and 29 (overweight), and
12% were z30 kg/m2 (obese).
Laboratory Methods. Urine specimens were assayed
with enzyme immunoassays for E1G, a metabolite of
estradiol, and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (PDG), a
metabolite of progesterone. Interassay and intra-assay
coefficients of variation (CV) were 9.2% and 10.3% for
the PDG enzyme immunoassay and 4% and 3.6% for the
E1G enzyme immunoassay (39, 40). The metabolites
and significant cross-reactants closely parallel the serum
levels of estradiol and progesterone (39, 40).
Hormone concentrations were estimated from absor-
bance (Biolinx 1.0 software; Dynex Laboratories). Urinary
hormone concentrations, assayed in duplicate, were
adjusted by specimen specific gravity using a population
mean specific gravity of 1.020 (41). E1G concentrations
were statistically corrected for slight assay nonparallel-
ism using a 1:5 dilution as the standard to which all
values were corrected (40).
Reproductive Stage. A reproductive stage was
assigned to each menstrual cycle in the study using a
four-category scale (Table 1) derived from the Staging
Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) recommenda-
tions (37). Based on the criteria of variability in cycle
length described in STRAW, we used the CV of
menstrual cycle length to assign stage.
Cycle length was calculated as the number of days
from the first day of a menstrual bleed to the last day
before the next bleed. A menstrual bleed was defined as a
segment with at least 2 days of bleeding in 6 consecutive
days, which had to be preceded by at least 5 consecutive
days of no bleeding.
A rolling cycle length CV (the SD of cycle length
divided by the mean cycle length) was calculated for
each cycle using the length of the current cycle and the
five previous cycles; this CV was used to assign stage to
each cycle. When fewer than five previous cycles were
available, all cycle lengths observed before the current
cycle were used.
Cutoff values for the rolling cycle length CV were
chosen to represent reproductive stages as close as

possible to the STRAW system (ref. 37; Table 1). Because
CV values of <20% represent <7 days deviation from a
34-day cycle, we used it to indicate premenopausal
cycling (stage -3). A 20% to 40% CV was chosen to
represent the STRAW criterion of cycle length variance
>7 days (stage -2). A CV >40% or the presence of a cycle
>60 days in length was used for the STRAW criterion of
two or more skipped cycles (stage -1). Postmenopause
(stage +1) was defined as 1 year with no menstrual
bleeding.
Cycles that were right or left censored at <60 days
within a 6-month interval were assigned a stage using
the predominant stage (the stage occurring z60% of the
time within the 6-month segment) in the interval. Cycles
censored at z60 days in length were assigned either stage
-1 or +1; in some censored cycles, it was not possible to
reliably differentiate between stages -1 and +1, but this
occurred in only 11 of 3,303 menstrual segments.
Intervals where the most prevalent stage occurred
<60% of the time were coded as mixed stage. This
designation was assigned to 39 of the 359 six-month
intervals. Forty-four percent of the 39 cases included
stages -3, -2 and -1 within an interval, 8% were cases
of one reproductive stage and a substantial censored
segment, and the remainder were other combinations of
the stages -3, -2, and -1 and censored segments.
Quantification of Total and Unopposed Estrogen. To
quantify total estrogen levels, we examined mean E1G
area under the curve (AUC). We also examined the 5th
and 95th percentiles of E1G as indicators of baseline and
peak levels of E1G, respectively. We assessed how these
varied by age and stage while controlling for BMI.
To quantify unopposed estrogen, we used the total
number of days per cycle where PDG was at a per-cycle
baseline level and E1G was above a per-cycle baseline
level. A daily running 5-day PDG average was used to
create a daily PDG ratio (PR): the PDG of the current day
divided by the average PDG. A PR < 3.0 was considered
baseline PDG; when the PR exceeded 3.0 for at least
3 days in a 5-day sequence (the criterion used in
ovulation detection algorithms to identify a sustained
rise in PDG; e.g., ref. 42), then all days from the first day
the PR exceeded 3.0 to the end of the cycle were scored
as having sufficient progesterone to oppose estrogen. To
identify days where E1G was above baseline level, we
began with a day of estrogen takeoff (43). All subsequent
days were scored as above E1G baseline until the end of
the cycle or a clear decline in E1G occurred. E1G data for
menstrual cycles were first smoothed using the function:
smoothed E1G = (previous day's E1G value) (0.25) +
(current day's E1G value) (0.50) + (next day's E1G value)
(0.25). Inactive (baseline estrogen) periods were identi-
fied by one of us (R.J.F.) from graphs showing menstrual
bleeds and smoothed E1G data. The end of an inactive
period was indicated by a sharp and sustained increase
in E1G and was scored as the first day of E1G above
baseline.
All days between the day of estrogen takeoff and the
day of progesterone takeoff were designated as unop-
posed; all other days in a cycle were designated as
opposed. Additional criteria were needed in f20% of
cycles. In such cases, we used a steroid ratio (SR = E1G/
PDG) to indicate days when estrogen was elevated while
progesterone was at baseline (SR z 20). We developed a
hierarchical set of rules to accommodate all possible
cases and applied these to all cycles; the rules are
presented in the appendix. To test implementation of the
rules, a sample of 70 six-month segments of data was
scored independently by two investigators (K.A.O. and
R.J.F.). Inter-rater agreement based on the j statistic was
95% for 12,030 observations (j = 0.8533; SD = 0.0091). The
discrepancies between raters were small and not sys-
tematic. One investigator then assigned days of unop-
posed estrogen to all data.
Statistical Analyses of Total and Unopposed
Estrogen by Age and Reproductive Stage. The unit of
analysis was a 6-month interval. Total estrogen was
calculated as the AUC for daily E1G over the interval
from January 15 to July 14 of each year. If >30 days were
missing data, the interval was excluded. If <7 consecutive
days were missing, AUC was interpolated. Where >7
consecutive days were missing or there were missing data
at either end, AUC was computed without that segment,
and the final result was weighted upward to represent the
full 181-day span. We also used daily E1G data to
estimate baseline (5th percentile) and peak (95th percen-
tile) E1G levels for the 6-month intervals. The total
number of days of unopposed estrogen for each interval
was estimated by summing the individual days of
unopposed E1G across the interval. For intervals with
<181 days of complete data, the sums were weighted
upward to represent counts over 181 days.
We used linear mixed-effects models to assess whether
AUC, baseline, peak, and unopposed estrogen differed
by stage. Models had two levels: individual and within-
individual. Individual was considered a random effect;
fixed effects comprised stage, age at study entry, and
within-subject longitudinal aging (difference between
age at study entry and age at beginning of 6-month
interval). Analyses were done on logged values of E1G.

for the full 30 months (five 6-month study intervals); the
average length of participation was 21 months (36). For
this article, data were excluded for (a) participants with
no uterus, (b) 3 months following exogenous hormone
use, pregnancy, breastfeeding, miscarriage, major sur-
gery, chemotherapy, or use of any medications known to
affect reproductive hormone or menstrual bleed patterns,
and (c) ambiguous bleed or cycle day information. The
resulting sample included 108 women, 64,671 woman-
days of observation, and 359 six-month intervals.
Reproductive Stage. The CV method for assigning
stage is very similar to the SD method used by Lisabeth
et al. (44) for classifying women into stages; comparison
of the two methods using our data yielded 92%
agreement in assigning the same discrete stages based
on cycle length variation.
Although mean age increased across stages, each
stage had a broad and similar range of ages represented
(Table 2).
Total, Baseline, and Peak Estrogen. Participant age,
mean F SD values for E1G AUC, and 5th and 95th
percentiles are shown for each stage in Table 2. Total
(AUC), baseline (5th percentile), and peak (95th percen-
tile) E1G varied by stage adjusting for age (P < 0.0001 for
all three models; Fig. 1). E1G AUC was higher for stage -3
than for stages -1 (P = 0.0013) and +1 (P < 0.0001); there
were no differences in AUC among stages -3 and -2 and
mixed stages (Fig. 1). There were differences (P < 0.0001)
in 5th and 95th E1G percentiles by stage while adjusting
for cross-sectional age (at beginning of interval) and
longitudinal age (time in study). Mean peak E1G was
higher in stage -3 than stage +1 (P < 0.0001), and mean
baseline E1G was higher in stage -3 than in stages -1 and
+1 (P < 0.0001 for each). There were no significant
differences in mean peak or total E1G between stage -3
and the transition stages combined (-2, mixed, and -1).
Baseline E1G was higher in stage -3 than the transition
stages combined (P < 0.001; Fig. 1).
There was a significant interaction between subject age
and stage for total and peak E1G (P < 0.0001), with a
much weaker result for baseline E1G (P = 0.032). In
general, even after adjusting for age at study entry, E1G
tended to increase with age in stage -3 but decrease with
age in stage -1 (Fig. 2).
The above findings that average EIG AUC and average
baseline E1G did not decline until late in the transition
(stage -3), whereas average peak E1G did not decline
until the postmenopause (stage +1), were unchanged
with the addition of BMI to the models.
Unopposed Estrogen. Figure 3 shows typical exam-
ples of 6 months of E1G, PDG, and menses for
participants in stage -3 (A), -2 (B), -1 (C), and +1 (D).
In premenopausal women, the days of unopposed
estrogen cluster tightly in the mid to late follicular phase.
Anovulatory cycles and prolonged periods of follicular
development contribute to days of unopposed estrogen
in stage -2 women. In stage -1, prolonged follicular
growth and estrogen secretion, with much of it unop-
posed by progesterone, is typical. Fig. 3D is from a
recently (within the 2 previous years) menopausal
participant with low E1G and PDG but a clear period
of follicular development not followed by ovulation or a
menses.
Two of the 359 intervals were excluded because
>30 days of data could not be scored for unopposed
estrogen. Eighty-two percent (110) of intervals in stage +1
had no days of unopposed estrogen, whereas other stages
always had days of unopposed estrogen. We therefore
focused analysis on the other stages, comprising 223
intervals from 78 women. We found no differences in
mean total days of unopposed estrogen (TDUE) among
these stages (P = 0.10). However, mean TDUE for stage -2
and the mixed stage were higher than mean TDUE for
stage -3 (Fig. 4). There was no significant difference
between mean TDUE for stages -3 and -1, which may be
partially a result of the large between- and within-subject
variability of TDUE in stage -1 (Fig. 5). When the
transitional stages (-2, mixed, and -1) were combined
into a single category, TDUE was higher in the transition
compared with stage -3 (P = 0.027; Fig. 4). In each of these
models, there was significant interaction between stage

and longitudinal aging (P < 0.0001), with TDUE tending
to increase with age in stage -3 and decrease with age in
stages -2 and -1 (Fig. 5). The results were unchanged by
the addition of BMI to the models.
Discussion
Our results show that reproductive stage, as assessed by
a running CV of menstrual cycle length, is an important
correlate of a woman's total E1G: women of the same age
can have quite different E1G profiles if they are in
different stages. In previous work, we showed that E1G
increased with age until the mid to late 40s (36); here, we
show that this trend is characteristic of stage -3 and that
E1G decline with age is typical in stage -1 (Fig. 2). Total
E1G levels as assessed by AUC were similar and at their
highest in -3, -2, and mixed stages; they did not decline
until the late transition, stage -1 (Fig. 1). The low E1G
levels in stage -1 are largely attributable to long periods
of no ovarian activity in the longer cycles characteristic
of this stage (43). Peak E1G levels did not decline until
the postmenopause (stage +1); baseline E1G levels
declined across each stage from -3 or -2 to the mixed
stage, to the -1 stage, and still further to stage +1 (Fig. 1).
Other studies have examined estrogen indicators by
reproductive stage but used different stage definitions or
hormone measures, rendering comparisons difficult.
Overall, the results of our study and others (24) suggest
that total and peak estrogen levels do not increase across

and +1 (D; age 53 y).

the transition to menopause, when the transition is
defined by cycle length variability, and do not begin to
decline until late in the menopausal transition. Thus, one
would predict that cancer risk related to total or peak
estrogen exposure would not change with the timing of
onset of, or be directly related to the duration of, the
menopausal transition. Hormone levels clearly vary by
reproductive stage and cannot be predicted using age
alone, so this relationship must be regarded as an
important area for future research. Indeed, this was one
of the reasons the STRAW system was developed (37).
Total level of estrogen is a risk factor for breast
cancer in premenopausal (6) and postmenopausal (45,
46) women, with higher levels associated with higher
risk. Similarly, long-term exposure to elevated estrogen
is a risk factor for ovarian cancer (7, 47). Lifetime
exposure to estrogen has long been of epidemiologic
interest, and late menopause is considered a major risk
factor for endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancers (47).
The mechanism by which elevated or prolonged
exposure to estrogens contribute to each of these
cancers are not clear and may vary depending on the
target organ (47).
In contrast to total and peak E1G, the number of days
of unopposed estrogen increased during the transition to
menopause and remained high even when total and peak
E1G began to decline late in the transition (Figs. 1, 4, and
5). The number of days of unopposed estrogen exposure
did not decline until the postmenopause (stage +1).
Exposure to relatively high levels of unopposed estrogen
even occurs, albeit at a greatly reduced frequency, in the
postmenopausal years (Figs. 4 and 5). This evidence of
follicular development occurred in seven participants
who were tentatively classified as postmenopausal
within the previous 1 to 2 years, and seven other
participants whose last bleeds were known to have been
2 to 8 years prior. Metcalf et al. reported similar evidence
for postmenopausal follicular development (48).
One other study (49) has characterized unopposed
estrogen exposure in premenopausal (defined as regu-
larly cycling and age <40 years) and perimenopausal
(defined as having a spontaneous break in cycle
regularity and age >40 years) women. That study used
a ratio of estrogen to progesterone to estimate unopposed
estrogen exposure (49). The percentage of time spent at
high levels of urinary E1G (>50 nmol or 70 nmol/24 h)
with reduced urinary PDG exposure was significantly
higher in perimenopausal than premenopausal women.
Unusually long cycles (>50 days) were common in
perimenopausal women and were associated with
prolonged episodes of unopposed estrogen secretion.
The differences between the Metcalf et al. measure of
unopposed estrogen and ours allows only a rough
comparison, but the findings are similar: both reveal
that there is significant exposure to unopposed estrogen
during the perimenopause and that both longer and
shorter cycles include long periods of unopposed
estrogen (Fig. 3B and C). To obtain more comparable
results, we also used a simple estrogen-to-progesterone
ratio. Our results did not change significantly (data not
shown). We have important concerns, however, about
the ratio as applied to our data: interindividual variation
in PDG and E1G levels (36) confounded the variation
associated with stage and age. For some women, the ratio
did not capture unopposed estrogen at all, because,
compared with other women, their PDG tended to be
high relative to their E1G (data not shown). An
advantage of our approach is that it is independent of
absolute hormone levels.
The link between unopposed estrogen and endome-
trial cancer is well established (13, 50). Relatively low
levels of either exogenous or endogenous estrogen
trigger endometrial proliferation (50), with proliferation
beginning as early as the second day of the cycle and
continuing at significant levels until mitotic prolifera-
tion begins to decline shortly after ovulation (13). It is
not clear at what point there is sufficient progesterone
secretion to counteract the proliferative effects of
estrogen, but the level and duration of elevated
progesterone could be factors influencing endometrial
cancer (51). High levels of progesterone may be needed
to effectively oppose high levels of estrogens (13).
Duration of progesterone exposure may also be
important; a minimum of 12 to 16 days of progestins
in oral contraceptives is required to prevent hyperplas-
tic endometrial response (13). Our study did not make
a distinction between high and low levels of E1G or
PDG, nor did it measure duration of PDG elevation.
Consequently, our approach may underestimate the
number of days of unopposed estrogen. If this bias is
important, and if ovulatory cycles also declined in
frequency across the transition, we could be missing an
overall decline in number of days of unopposed
estrogen from stage -3 to transitional stages. However,
even if we corrected for this possible bias, the number
of days of unopposed E1G would remain high across
the transition, especially late in the transition when
total E1G declines.
Our results suggest that the perimenopausal years are
an important period of exposure to both unopposed and
high estrogen levels. This result, coupled with the
epidemiologic evidence on lifetime exposure to estrogen,
suggests that variation in the amount of time spent in the
transition to menopause may be an important correlate
or risk factor for ovarian, breast, and endometrial
cancers. To the best of our knowledge, only one study
has reported statistical information on the length of the
perimenopause: McKinlay et al. give a median of
3.8 years based on a large prospective study (12). Given
the findings presented here, quantifying the length of the
perimenopause and how this may vary among women is
an important area for future research.

Our results may not be applicable to all women. Our
sample is biased toward (a) women who chose not to
use either hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as they
went through the menopausal transition or oral contra-
ceptives to prevent pregnancy and (b) White, middle
class, and college educated women (36). Of particular
concern is whether the women who did not participate
in all 30 months of the study were in any way different
from those for whom there are no missing data. The
most common reason for withdrawal from our study
was use of HRT, but there were no significant differ-
ences in mean age between women who withdrew
from the study (for HRT or other reasons) and those
who did not (36). There is evidence indicating that
breast cancer type and risk may differ between HRT
users and never-users (52); this suggests that cycle
length and/or estrogen characteristics may differ
between women who did and did not choose to go
on HRT. Perimenopausal symptoms leading to HRT
use have been associated with reduced estrogen
secretion (53), which our and other data (43) show
tends to be associated with elongated cycles. Our
analyses here may thus be overestimating estrogen
exposure across the transition to menopause for some
women.
A limitation of our study is that we have only one
measure of BMI, taken at the midpoint of the study, and
these data were available for only 90 of the 108 women in
our analyses. We were able to impute BMI for the year
2000 using data from previous years for the remaining
18 women. BMI is associated with estrogen levels, and it
is this link that is believed to explain the association
between body weight and cancer risk (8, 54). Studies that
have examined BMI change across the transition to
menopause report an average annual increase in BMI of
0.2 to 0.4 kg/m2/y (55, 56). Thus, although adding BMI
did not alter the results of our analyses, our midpoint
estimate may not be an accurate representation of BMI
across the study period.
The cycle length variance we chose as cutoffs for each
stage could have been determined in a different
manner. Our goal was to operationalize the STRAW
system for use with a large collection of cycle data. The
advantage of a CV-based approach is that it is sensitive
to the mean. Like the method used by Lisabeth et al.
(44), our approach replicates the spirit of the original
STRAW system, designed to be used by women,
clinicians, and researchers alike. That reproductive stage
is broadly predictive of estrogen exposure is promising
for future work examining how other, more nuanced,
serial indicators of menstrual cycle length may be
associated with hormone levels. This study focused on
``variability'' in menstrual cycle length as an indicator of
reproductive status. This can be expanded to include an
assessment of menstrual cycle length ``regularity'' using
an indicator of serial irregularity in time-series data--
approximate entropy. In previous work using approx-
imate entropy with TREMIN data on cycles from
women ages >40 years, we found that both increased
variability and greater serial regularity were significant
predictors of the onset of menopause (17). A woman's
lifetime history of menstrual cycle variability and
stability may also be an important predictor of hormone
status across the transition to menopause; in recent
work on a cohort of TREMIN women, we identified five
categories of women's menstrual histories based on
variability and stability and found that taxonomic
category was associated with age at menarche, number
of births, and age at menopause (57). For the BIMORA
women, we have up to 30 years of reproductive
histories, which we are linking with the hormone data
to explore how hormone levels across the transition
may be associated with a woman's lifetime history of
more stable or more erratic patterns of menstrual cycle
lengths.
Conclusions
We found that (a) E1G levels increased with age in stage -
3 women up until the mid to late 40s; (b) E1G AUC did
not decline significantly until later in the menopausal
transition (stage -1); (c) whereas baseline (5th percentile)
E1G levels declined across the transition, peak (95th
percentile) levels did not decline until the post-
menopause; and (d) the total number of days of
unopposed estrogen exposure were higher in the
transition than before it and remained high until the
postmenopause. Given the length of time women spend
in the transition to menopause, they are exposed to more
total and unopposed estrogen than has been previously
appreciated.

Appendix A. Scoring Cycles for Days of Unopposed
Estrogen
Definitions: FD, follicular development; C, close of
inactive phase (start of E1G secretion).
Rules:
Summary: mark all days of SR z 20 as unopposed
EXCEPT the standard case, where we go strictly from
(C + 1) to (PR z 3.0-1). The standard case constitutes

much of the data, and the other captures most of the
exceptions.
1. Look at profile
a. If yes menopausal (no bleeds)
i. If no evidence of FD (FD z 5 days of increase
and decline in E1G), mark all days as opposed
ii. If yes evidence of FD
1. If no evidence of ovulation, mark all days as
unopposed within period of FD with SR z 20
2. If yes evidence of ovulation, mark all days as
unopposed from first day within period of FD
where SR z 20 up to the day before the first
PR z 3.0 where ovulation is occurring
b. If not menopausal proceed to no. 2
2. If not menopausal, find first day of PR z 3.0
a. If yes PR z 3.0
i. If first day PR z 3.0 is within the first 5 days
of the cycle, ignore and find next time PR z 3.0.
ii. If there is run of PR z 3.0 (at least 3 days within
a 5-day period), it is not within the first 5 days of
the cycle, and it is not within a very long cycle
(long z 40 days), this is ovulation. Mark the
first day where PR z 3.0 and go to no. 3.
1. If a run of PR z 3.0 occurs within a very long
cycle, consult profile to identify if these are
anomalous, anovulatory, or ovulatory. Mark
all days to end of cycle with SR z 20 as
unopposed.
2. If there are multiple days scattered through
cycle where PR z 3.0 (statistical artifact of long
cycles with inactive phases), visually assess
where ovulation is occurring and identify the
closestPRz 3.0 toclosetheperiod ofunopposed
estrogen. If cycle is anovulatory (ovul2 = -1),
mark all days up to end of cycle with SR z 20
as unopposed.
b. If no PR z 3.0
i. If there is only one or no days of PR z 3.0
outside of the first 5 days of the cycle, cycle is
anovulatory (ovul2 = -1), and SR is z20, mark
all days from (C +1) on as unopposed as long
as SR z 20.
1. If no C use all days where SR > 20.
2. For right censored cases, mark to end of cycle
if SR z 20.
3. If ovulation is present in graph but PR does
not pick it up, use all days where SR z 20 up to
day before ovulation on graph.
3. If yes C has a value, mark all days unopposed from
(C + 1) to (PR marked day -1) regardless of SR values.
a. If C is a negative number, assign first cycle day as
beginning of unopposed estrogen
b. C cannot come after PR > -3.0. Visually assess and
use alternative criteria (SR)
c. Check graph re C!
i. Left censored cycles are a place where this com-
monly occurs. If SR z 20, record as unopposed E.
ii. This will catch unopposed estrogen that is from
a previous cycle but is not linked to the current
cycle's C. If SR z 20, record as unopposed E.
4. If no C value mark all days SR z 20 as unopposed
up to day before PR z 3.0. If no PR z 3.0 see 2b.
5. Ignore C if no hormone data for a day. Do not score
cycle; it probably has no unopposed E days.
6. If cycle is missing >10 days of data, with most
missing days consecutive, do not score.
7. Right and left censored cycles can be scored using
above rules in conjunction with viewing the profile.
8. Check graphs when scoring cycles. For cases that do
not fit into above, score visually and/or use SR
criteria.
