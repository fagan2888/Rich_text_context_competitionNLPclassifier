Researchers are increasingly turning to Amazon's
Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to recruit subjects for public
opinion research (e.g., Ahler, 2014; Arceneaux, 2012;
Clifford, 2014; Grimmer et al., 2012; Huber and Paris,
2013; Johnston et al., 2015). MTurk allows the rapid
recruitment of a diverse sample of subjects at a dramati-
cally lower cost than professional online panels (Berinsky
et al., 2012). Researchers have taken numerous approaches
to validating MTurk as a sample recruitment tool.
Experimental results have been replicated on MTurk
across a variety of topics, including framing effects
(Berinsky et al., 2012; Weinberg et al., 2014), decision-
making biases (Goodman et al., 2013; Paolacci et al.,
2010), economic games (Horton et al., 2011), and cogni-
tive psychology tasks (Crump et al., 2013). Others have
shown that data from MTurk samples meet common psy-
chometric standards (Buhrmester et al., 2011; Shapiro
et al., 2013). MTurk respondents also pay as much or
more attention than respondents from other populations
(Hauser and Schwarz, forthcoming; Paolacci et al., 2010;
Weinberg et al., 2014).
Yet, there are a number of concerns about the use of MTurk
as well (e.g., Chandler et al., 2014; Krupnikov and Levine,
2014). Much of the debate over the validity of MTurk as a
recruitment tool has followed the discipline's "near obses-
sion" with the external validity of a sample (McDermott,
2002: 334). Researchers consistently find that MTurk sam-
ples tend to be more politically liberal, younger, less religious,
and less racially diverse than the U.S. population (Berinsky
et al. 2012; Huff and Tingley, 2015).
While scholars have documented many of the differences
and similarities between MTurk samples and the national
public, some critics maintain that the sample is invalid for
political research.1 According to this view, the selection pro-
cess that produces disproportionately liberal samples implies
Are samples drawn from Mechanical Turk
valid for research on political ideology?

Abstract
Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is an increasingly popular tool for the recruitment of research subjects. While
there has been much focus on the demographic differences between MTurk samples and the national public, we know
little about whether liberals and conservatives recruited from MTurk share the same psychological dispositions as their
counterparts in the mass public. In the absence of such evidence, some have argued that the selection process involved
in joining MTurk invalidates the subject pool for studying questions central to political science. In this paper, we evaluate
this claim by comparing a large MTurk sample to two benchmark national samples ­ one conducted online and one
conducted face-to-face. We examine the personality and value-based motivations of political ideology across the three
samples. All three samples produce substantively identical results with only minor variation in effect sizes. In short,
liberals and conservatives in our MTurk sample closely mirror the psychological divisions of liberals and conservatives
in the mass public, though MTurk liberals hold more characteristically liberal values and attitudes than liberals from
representative samples. Overall, our results suggest that MTurk is a valid recruitment tool for psychological research on
political ideology.

that the conservatives who opt into MTurk differ from other
conservatives in psychological dispositions central to their
identities. If this claim were true, it may render MTurk sam-
ples invalid for studying political and ideological divides.
This would be particularly worrisome for research using ide-
ology or partisanship as a moderator of experimental treat-
ment effects (e.g., Bullock, 2011; Druckman et al., 2013;
Nyhan and Reifler, 2010) or examining psychological differ-
ences between liberals and conservatives (e.g., Feldman and
Johnston, 2014). Importantly, the lack of substantial system-
atic evidence for whether the selection process generates
samples that are valid for psychological research on ideo-
logical divisions in the mass public has limited this debate.
In this paper, we first review existing evidence on the psy-
chological differences between respondents drawn from
MTurk and alternative populations. We then compare psy-
chological models of political ideology across American
National Election Studies (ANES) and MTurk samples. We
find that conservatives recruited from MTurk look nearly
identical to their counterparts in national samples, though
MTurk liberals tend to have more liberal dispositions than
ANES liberals. We next model political ideology as a func-
tion of personality and values, and find strikingly similar
results across samples. Overall, our findings suggest that
research into the psychological dispositions behind political
ideology would reach largely the same conclusions regard-
less of the sample chosen. Our results suggest, with some
caveats, that MTurk is a valid recruitment tool for psycho-
logical research on political ideology.
Psychological differences between
liberals and conservatives
Liberals and conservatives differ in a variety of psychological
dispositions, most notably in their personality traits and value
orientations. Decades of research has established the Big Five
personalitytraits­OpennesstoExperience,Conscientiousness,
Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability ­ as a
useful framework for understanding stable dispositions that
underlie individual behavior (Costa and McCrae, 1992). Two
of the Big Five traits, in particular, are consistently strong pre-
dictors of ideology. Liberals tend to score higher in Openness,
demonstrating greater interest in new information and ideas
(Gerber et al., 2013). Conservatives tend to score higher in
Conscientiousness, demonstrating greater dependability and
self-discipline (Gerber et al., 2013). Findings for other traits
arelessconsistent,butthereissomeevidencethatExtraversion
is associated with conservatism (e.g., Gerber et al., 2010;
Mondak and Halperin, 2008), and thatAgreeableness predicts
liberalism (Mondak, 2010).
Liberals and conservatives differ even more strongly in
their values. We focus on four values commonly used in
research on political attitudes and identities: egalitarianism,
moral traditionalism, authoritarianism, and racial resent-
ment. The first three values represent the preference for equal
opportunity, traditional family structures, and conformity
and obedience, respectively. The fourth, racial resentment,
represents a blend of racial prejudice and the values of indi-
vidualism and self-reliance (Henry and Sears, 2002).
Psychological characteristics of MTurk
respondents
We know that personality affects self-selection into online
panels (Brüggen and Dholakia, 2010; Dollinger and Leong,
1993; Rogelberg et al., 2003), however, we do not have evi-
dence of any selection differences between MTurk and
other panels. Though we are not aware of any study analyz-
ing the determinants of participation on MTurk, it has been
shown that MTurk samples tend to differ from other sam-
ples in personality and other dispositions. Compared to an
adult community sample, MTurk workers have lower self-
esteem, and lower levels of Extraversion, Emotional
Stability, and Openness (Goodman et al., 2013). MTurk
subjects also tend to score higher in Need for Cognition and
Need to Evaluate than national samples (Berinsky et al.,
2012). In short, there is some evidence that MTurk samples
differ from other populations on personality traits and other
psychological dispositions.
We have little evidence, however, regarding how the self-
selection process might affect political divides on MTurk.
Scherer et al. (2014) find the same partisan differences in
System Justification in an MTurk sample and a nationally
representative sample. Grimmer et al. (2012) find that the
associations between partisanship, ideology, and feelings
towards Barack Obama are substantively identical across
MTurk and nationally representative samples. However, no
work has systematically investigated whether liberals and
conservatives on MTurk share the same personality traits
and values as their counterparts in the mass public. In other
words, do the same values and personality traits that moti-
vate ideological differences in other types of samples also
divide liberal and conservative subjects on MTurk?
Data and methods
We follow the logic of parallel studies (Clifford and Jerit,
2014; Hainmueller et al., 2015; Jerit et al., 2013) and com-
pare a large sample recruited from MTurk to two national
benchmarks. Our benchmark data comes from the ANES
2012 Time Series Study conducted before and after the
2012 US presidential election, which recruited 1413
respondents for face-to-face interviews (FTF) and 3860
respondents for a web-based survey (Web). The FTF sam-
ple was collected using computer-assisted self-interview-
ing and relied on an address-based sampling frame. The
Web sample was recruited from GfK Knowledge Networks'
address-based sampling frame. Our MTurk survey was
posted online in June 2015 and described as a "Personality
and Values Survey." The Human Intelligence Task's (HIT)
Clifford et al. 3
description read: "Answer short survey. Should take 8 to 10
minutes. This project has been approved by the University
of Houston Committee for the Protection of Human
Subjects." The keywords tied to the HIT were survey,
demographics, politics, personality, psychology, and val-
ues. It was made available to 1500 US residents with an
acceptance rate of at least 95%. Subjects were paid US$0.40
for completion.2 Demographics are shown in Table A1 in
the online Appendix.
Measures
All of our measures are drawn directly from the ANES, so
we discuss them only briefly here (see online Appendix for
full question wording).3 Political ideology and partisanship
are both measured using standard seven-point scales. Social
and economic ideology are each measured as indices of
policy attitudes following the approach of Feldman and
Johnston (2014). All dependent variables are coded such
that higher values are more conservative.
We measure the Big Five personality traits using the
Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI; Gosling et al., 2003).
Moral traditionalism, racial resentment, and egalitarianism
are measured as the average agreement with 4­6 state-
ments. Authoritarianism is measured using the child traits
battery (Feldman and Stenner, 1997). Our demographic
controls include age, education, gender, income, and religi-
osity (following Feldman and Johnston, 2014).
Results
We begin by graphically displaying the levels of each inde-
pendent variable across each measure of ideology. Results
for partisanship were substantively identical and are shown
in the online Appendix (Figures A1­A3). Figure 1 displays
the average level of each personality trait across self-place-
ment ideology for each sample (ANES FTF, ANES Web,
and MTurk). The means and sample differences are shown
in Table A2 in the online Appendix.
Starting with the top-left panel, Extraversion is uncor-
related with ideology across all samples. However, ANES
FTF respondents are significantly more extraverted than
both ANES Web and MTurk samples, and MTurk subjects
are less extraverted than the FTF sample (Cohen's d = .59)
and the Web sample (d = .30). Cohen's d is the difference
between the means of two groups divided by their pooled
standard deviation, which provides a measure of effect size
relative to the variation in the dependent variable (Cohen,
1988). Turning to the top-right panel, Agreeableness is not
significantly related to political ideology in any of the sam-
ples, nor are there large differences in means between the
samples. Conscientiousness is positively correlated with
conservatism across all three samples (all ps < .01).
Emotional Stability is positively correlated with ideology
in all samples, but this relationship is statistically
significant only in the MTurk sample (p < .01). Finally,
Openness is negatively correlated with ideology in all sam-
ples (all ps < .01). The MTurk sample scores notably higher
in Openness than the Web sample (d = .39), but similar to
the FTF sample (d = .09). Overall, correlations between the
Big Five traits and political ideology are substantively
identical across samples with the exception of Emotional
Stability. The MTurk sample is also lower in Extraversion
than both ANES samples.
Figure 2 displays the mean level of each value orienta-
tion across self-reported ideology. Authoritarianism, racial
resentment, and moral traditionalism are positively associ-
ated with conservatism across all three samples (all ps <
.01). While conservatives are nearly indistinguishable
across samples, MTurk liberals score notably lower in each
value than ANES liberals. These differences may be due, in
part, to lower levels of religiosity (see Table A3 in the
online Appendix). Egalitarianism is negatively correlated
with ideology across all samples (ps < .01), though MTurk
liberals score slightly higher than ANES liberals. Overall,
we find the same relationships between values and political
ideology, and conservatives are nearly indistinguishable
across samples. However, we find a stronger relationship
between values and political ideology in the MTurk sam-
ple, with liberals taking more characteristically liberal posi-
tions. The stronger correlations may reflect the fact that
MTurk respondents tend to be more politically knowledge-
able than the nationally representative samples (Berinsky
et al., 2012), though we cannot directly test this claim.
Figure 3 displays social and economic ideology as a
function of self-reported ideology. Ideological subgroups
are highly similar across samples, though MTurk liberals
have more liberal social preferences and slightly more lib-
eral economic preferences, consistent with the results
above.
Psychological models of political ideology
We now move away from descriptive statistics and ask
whether researchers investigating the psychological anteced-
ents of political ideology would reach the same conclusions
if they relied on an MTurk sample rather than anANES sam-
ple. Below we present six Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
models, each predicting one of three dependent variables
(self-reported ideology, social ideology, and economic ideol-
ogy), using one of the two sets of independent variables (per-
sonality traits or values) and demographic controls. For
similar approaches, see Gerber et al. (2010), Mondak and
Halperin (2008), and Feldman and Johnston (2014). For ease
of comparison, we plot the coefficients from the models and
exclude demographic variables (see Tables A4­7 in the
online Appendix for full model results).
The left column of Figure 4 displays the coefficients for
personality traits predicting self-reported ideology. Starting
at the top, Openness is a significant predictor of liberal

ideology across all samples (ps < .001). The coefficients on
Emotional Stability are positive in all samples and similar
in magnitude, but statistically significant only in the MTurk
sample (p < .05). Conscientiousness is a strong predictor of
conservatism across all samples (ps < .001). Agreeableness
is a modest predictor of liberalism in only the Web and
MTurk samples (ps < .001). Finally, Extraversion does not
significantly predict ideology in any of the samples.
Overall, the results are nearly identical across samples.
The middle-left panel of Figure 4 displays the results of a
similar analysis predicting economic ideology. Openness
significantly predicts liberalism in all samples (ps < .01).
Emotional Stability is positive across all samples but only
statistically significant in the Web sample (p < .001).
Conscientiousness predicts conservatism in all samples
(ps < .05). Agreeableness predicts liberalism in all samples
(ps < .001), though this effect falls just short of statistical
significance in the Web sample. Extraversion is positive in
all samples, but only statistically significant in the Web sam-
ple. Overall, the results are again highly similar across sam-
ples, though the Web sample showed two minor deviations
from the other samples.
The bottom-left panel of Figure 4 shows the results for
social ideology. Openness significantly predicts liberalism
for all samples (ps < .001). Emotional Stability has a null
effect in all samples. Conscientiousness is positive for all
samples, but is statistically significant only in the ANES
samples (ps < .01). Agreeableness significantly predicts lib-
eralism in the Web and MTurk samples (ps < .05), but is null
in the FTF sample. Finally, Extraversion is null for all sam-
ples. Overall, there was some variation in the results across
samples, though theANES samples seemed to disagree with
each other about as often as with the MTurk sample.
We now conduct the same three analyses using values as
our independent variables. The top-right panel of Figure 4
displays the results for self-reported ideology.
Authoritarianism does not significantly predict ideology in
any of the samples. Racial resentment and moral traditional-
ism both significantly predict conservatism across all sam-
ples (ps < .001). Lastly, egalitarianism is a significant
predictor of liberalism across all samples (ps < .001). Overall,
the results are substantively identical across samples.
The middle-right panel of Figure 4 displays the results
predicting economic ideology. Authoritarianism predicts
more liberal economic ideology across all samples (ps <
.05). Racial resentment and moral traditionalism both pre-
dict conservatism across all samples (ps < .001). Lastly,
egalitarianism is a strong predictor of liberalism for all
samples (ps < .001). Again, we find no substantive differ-
ences between samples.

Finally, the bottom-right panel of Figure 4 shows the
results predicting social ideology. Authoritarianism signifi-
cantly predicts conservatism in both ANES samples (ps <
.001), but is null in the MTurk sample. Racial resentment is
positive in all samples, but only statistically significant in
the Web sample (p < .05). Moral traditionalism strongly
predicts social conservatism for all samples and egalitarian-
ism predicts liberalism across all samples (ps < .001).
Overall, the results are highly similar, with two exceptions,
in which the Web sample and MTurk sample disagreed with
the other samples.
Do coefficient estimates significantly differ
across samples?
While the results above are highly similar across samples,
there were some apparent differences in effect sizes. To test
whether these effects are significantly different from each
other, we estimated a series of models pooling two of the
three samples together at a time (e.g., Web vs. MTurk).
Each model includes a dummy variable indicating the sam-
ple (e.g., Web = 0, MTurk = 1) and interactions between the
dummy variable and each of our independent variables
(excluding demographic variables). The interaction terms
in each model indicate whether the coefficients are signifi-
cantly different in magnitude across samples. We repeated
this approach for each of our four dependent variables
(self-reported ideology, partisanship, economic ideology,
and social ideology). Full model results are shown in Tables
A8­14. For each of the three sample comparisons, this
amounts to 36 tests (for a total of 108), raising concerns
about multiple comparisons. We address this concern by
controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995; Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001), which we
set to .05 (e.g., Battaglini et al., 2007).
Beginning with the comparison between the ANES FTF
and Web samples as a benchmark, we find one significant dif-
ference in effect size out of 36 tests. However, after controlling
for the FDR, we find no significant differences. Comparing
MTurk to the FTF sample, we find five significant differences,
though only one remains after controlling the FDR (authori-
tarianism predicting social ideology). Comparing MTurk to
the Web, we find six significant differences, but after control-
ling the FDR, only three out of 36 remain. These three differ-
ences are in moral traditionalism predicting economic
ideology, racial resentment predicting partisanship, and
authoritarianism predicting social ideology. The only apparent
pattern in these few differences is that all three independent
variables are values endorsed more by conservatives. Overall,
however, our MTurk sample generated results that are sub-
stantively nearly identical to theANES and effect sizes that are
indistinguishable in the vast majority of cases.
Conclusion
While much research has documented the characteristics of
MTurk workers, there has been little research on whether the
selection process of joining MTurk results in subjects who are
psychologically different from the general population in
terms of the relationship between personality traits, values,
and ideology. Our results suggest that MTurk conservatives
share the same personality traits and values as conservatives
drawn from high-quality national samples. Indeed, our con-
servatives were largely indistinguishable across samples. The
differences that we did find were largely among the liberal
subjects. MTurk liberals appear to hold more characteristi-
cally liberal values and political attitudes. As for personality
traits, we found few differences across samples with the
exception of Extraversion. Here, the differences were primar-
ily in the average level of the variable (rather than its relation-
ship with ideology). Whereas the FTF sample was the most
extraverted, the MTurk sample was the least.
Following the approach of recent research in political
psychology, we also examined the psychological predictors
of political ideology. The results were substantively nearly
identical across samples, indicating that a researcher would
draw largely the same conclusions if they chose to sample

from MTurk, rather than rely on the ANES. Indeed, MTurk
effect sizes significantly differed from the ANES in only
four out of 72 tests. Most of these cases involved the pre-
dictive power of conservative values, such as moral tradi-
tionalism. It is unclear why these variables might have
weaker predictive power among the MTurk sample, but it
might indicate shifting political divisions among a younger
and less religious population.
Overall, our results suggest that the same values and
personality traits that motivate ideological differences in
the mass public also divide liberals and conservatives on
MTurk. Our study thus provides evidence for the validity of
samples drawn from MTurk for psychological research on
ideology. While conservatives in our sample closely
matched nationally representative samples in personality
and values, our liberals took on more characteristically lib-
eral attitudes and dispositions. As a result, it may be that
experimental treatments, such as persuasive frames, that
are designed to target liberal values are more effective
among MTurk liberals than among liberals drawn from a
representative sample. Researchers should be aware of this
possibility and should consider directly measuring the

dispositions their treatments are intended to target, rather
than relying on ideology as a proxy variable.
Even despite the observed similarities between MTurk and
other sample types, a number of important questions remain.
MTurk subjects tend to be more politically knowledgeable
than national samples (Berinsky et al., 2012) and as a result
may be better sorted and more polarized. MTurk subjects also
tend to be highly attentive, reducing concerns about satisfic-
ing. However, higher levels of attention may correspond with
larger treatment effects or different information processing
styles (e.g., Chong and Druckman, 2012), which may be due
to the common use of attention checks (Hauser and Schwarz,
2015). The validity of MTurk as a recruitment tool will be an
ongoing and topic-specific question.
Finally, we must note that our research does not provide
blanket support for the use of MTurk samples for several rea-
sons. Most obviously, our work focuses only on the relation-
ship between political ideology, values, and personality. Our
MTurk sample was also not a random sample of the MTurk
workforce.As a result, we cannot be confident that our results
apply to any sample drawn from MTurk. However, samples
drawn from MTurk consistently diverge from the national
population on several key characteristics, such as age, ideol-
ogy, and religiosity. The persistence of these findings sug-
gests that the demographics of MTurk are fairly stable
(Berinsky et al., 2012; Buhrmester et al., 2011; Huff and
Tingley, 2015; Krupnikov and Levine, 2014; Shapiro et al.,
2013). Lastly, concerns remain about the effects of subject
"savviness" or "non-naïveté" (Krupnikov and Levine, 2014;
Chandler et al., 2014), cross-talk (Chandler et al., 2014), and
other issues (for discussion, see Goodman et al., 2013;
Shapiro et al., 2013). However, our research does suggest that
MTurk workers largely share the psychological dispositions
of their ideological counterparts in the mass public.
