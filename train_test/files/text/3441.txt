Abstract: Sex differences in reactions to partner infidelity have often been studied by
comparing emotional reactions to scenarios of sexual versus emotional infidelity. Men,
relative to women, tend to react with more distress to partner sexual infidelity than to
emotional infidelity. Evolutionary theorists interpret this difference as evidence of sexually
dimorphic selection pressures. In contrast, focusing only on the simple effects within each
sex, social-cognitive theorists suggest that men and women do not differ in their reactions
to partner infidelity. As evidenced by recent rival meta-analytic reports, these diverging
perspectives remain largely unresolved and contentious. The present study was designed to
take a new approach by measuring attitudes toward partner infidelity. Results were
consistent with the evolutionary perspective: Men, to a significantly larger degree than
women, evaluated partner sexual infidelity more negatively than emotional infidelity.

Introduction
In one of the most cited evolutionary psychology studies, Buss, Larson, Westen,
and Semmelroth (1992) asked college students which would distress or upset them more:
Imagining their romantic partner forming a deep emotional attachment to another person,
or enjoying passionate sexual intercourse with that person. Evolutionary theory posits that
due to sexually dimorphic selection pressures, men and women have evolved different
sensitivities to emotional versus sexual infidelity. Indeed, 60% of men but only 17% of
women selected sexual infidelity as most distressing. Although the specific percentages
have varied somewhat across subsequent studies, this pattern of results has been replicated
many times (see meta-analyses by Carpenter, 2012; Harris, 2003).
Despite these consistent results, the evolutionary account of sex differences in
jealousy has been questioned. For example, Desteno and Salovey (1996) offered the
"double shot hypothesis" as an alternative explanation. When forced to choose only one

option that is most distressing, they argue that people reasonably select the type of
infidelity that they believe most likely implies the co-occurrence of both types of infidelity.
If men tend to believe that women will only engage in sex after falling in love (Harris and
Christenfield, 1996), men will perceive sexual infidelity as most distressing. Thus, the
reasoning goes, if a woman has formed a sexual relationship with another man she likely
also has strong emotional feelings toward the man. On the other hand, if women believe
that men eagerly have sex prior to, and often without ever, falling in love, women will
likely select emotional infidelity as worse. Stated differently, when a man is emotionally
attached to a woman it implies a much more serious relationship ­ one that has moved
beyond sexual activity. However, the "double shot" hypothesis has not been supported
when carefully pitted against evolutionary predictions (Buss et al., 1999).
Following the lack of support for the double-shot hypothesis, DeSteno and
colleagues (DeSteno, Bartlett, Braverman, and Salovey, 2002; DeSteno, Bartlett, and
Salovey, 2006; DeSteno, 2010) more recently argued that sex differences on forced-choice
measures are the result of a format-induced measurement artifact. Specifically, DeSteno
and colleagues posit that the forced-choice scenario leads participants to engage in an
effortful and gender socialized decision strategy concerning the likely outcomes and trade-
offs of each form of infidelity. Unfortunately, the specific considerations and trade-offs are
not specifically detailed. In fact, and despite the results of Buss et al. (1999), the only
explicit reference of a possible gender socialized decision strategy remains the
aforementioned "double shot hypothesis" (DeSteno et al., 2002).
To support the measurement artifact hypothesis, DeSteno and colleagues argue that
sex differences disappear under cognitions of cognitive load and when participants
separately rate their levels of distress to sexual and emotional infidelity on continuous
scales. In response, evolutionary theorists have demonstrated sex differences under both
deliberative and automatic (cognitive load) conditions (Barrett, Frederick, Haselton, and
Kurzban, 2006; Schutzwohl, 2007, 2008), and argued that smaller sex differences on
continuous scales can be accounted for because of ceiling (Buss et al., 1999; Edlund,
Heider, Scherer, Farc, and Sagarin, 2006) and scale labeling effects (Edlund and Sagarin,
2009).
Meta-analytic results
Attempting to resolve this continuing debate (DeSteno, 2010; Edlund, 2011), two
recently published meta-analyses were independently conducted (Carpenter, 2012; Sagarin
et al., 2012). Importantly, both focused on the results of studies employing continuous
scales. However, because of disagreements regarding the critical statistical analyses needed
to test evolutionary predictions, these meta-analyses reached opposite conclusions.
In line with social-cognitive theorists (e.g., DeSteno and Salovey, 1996; Harris,
2005, Harris and Christenfeld, 1996), Carpenter (2012) performed his meta-analysis with
the view that the evolutionary perspective implies two critical, and separate, predictions: 1)
Men will report significantly more distress to sexual infidelity than they do to emotional
infidelity, and 2) Women will report significantly more distress to emotional infidelity than
they do to sexual infidelity. With this focus on simple effects within participant sex, the
Carpenter meta-analysis found that both men and women tend to rate sexual infidelity as
Sex differences in attitudes toward infidelity

more distressing than emotional infidelity, leading Carpenter to conclude that his results
were consistent with the social-cognitive hypothesis of no sex differences in infidelity
distress. Not emphasized by Carpenter is the fact that the sexual minus emotional
difference was larger for men than it was for women. As described below, this pattern of
results is actually consistent with evolutionary predictions.
Taking a markedly different approach, Sagarin et al. (2012) conducted their meta-
analysis to examine the Participant Sex × Infidelity Type interaction. This approach is
based on the acknowledgement that many factors other than sexually dimorphic selection
pressures influence reactions to partner infidelity. These factors include the tendency for
women to report more intense emotions than men, the operationalization of infidelity, and
anchoring effects from the wording used on response scales (see Sagarin et al. for a
review). Given such factors, in any given study, simple effects may appear to be
inconsistent with evolutionary predictions (e.g., women reporting more distress to sexual
infidelity than to emotional infidelity). However, the critical test of evolutionary theory
according to Sagarin et al.'s perspective is detection of a significant relative sex difference:
Men, relative to women, should report a more pronounced negative reaction to sexual
infidelity than to emotional infidelity (Buss and Haselton, 2005; Sagarin, 2005). In other
words, the sexual infidelity minus emotional infidelity difference should be larger for men
than it is for women, resulting in a significant Participant Sex × Infidelity Type interaction.
This perspective provides a logical account for the varied patterns of simple effects in
previous studies, such as why in some studies both women and men are found to react more
negatively in response to partner sexual infidelity and why in some studies women report
similar levels of distress to both forms of infidelity. Indeed, with this focus the Sagarin et
al. meta-analysis of 45 independent samples found a statistically significant Participant ×
Infidelity Type interaction in the evolutionary theory supportive direction.
In summary, debates about the existence and meaning of sex differences in response
to partner infidelity continue, with little progress to date to resolve the seemingly
entrenched evolutionary and social-cognitive positions. Although recent meta-analyses
represent important progress, it is likely that they will serve to only bolster their respective
polarized positions. The aim of the present study was to take a novel approach to the study
of sex differences in reactions to partner infidelity. Specifically, this study was designed to
investigate attitudes toward partner infidelity. We describe our rationale below for why we
believe the attitude construct can contribute to our understanding of sex differences in
response to partner infidelity.
Do men and women differ in their attitudes toward partner infidelity?
Given that much of the research on sex differences in reactions to partner infidelity
has been conducted by social psychologists, and the central role of attitudes in social
psychological research (Allport, 1935; Albarracín and Vargas, 2010), it is surprising that no
previous studies have directly examined attitudes toward partner infidelity. Rather, because
evolutionary theory has focused on sex differences in emotional states triggered by
relationship threats, researchers have focused almost exclusively on individual affective
reactions (e.g., jealousy, distress). Although some theoretical approaches equate attitude
with affect, much of modern attitude theory describes attitudes as overall evaluative
Sex differences in attitudes toward infidelity

tendencies that reflect affective, cognitive, and behavioral experiences (Eagly and Chaiken,
1993). This framework is important because while very likely emotionally intense,
reactions to partner infidelity are not purely affective. Cognitive responses are also part of
the reaction to partner infidelity, such as attributions of blame versus understanding
(Bauerle, Amirkhan, and Hupka, 2002; Hall and Fincham, 2006). In a rare evolutionary
study examining sex differences in cognitive responses, Schutzwohl and Koch (2004)
found that men, relative to women, preferentially process and have better memory for cues
to sexual infidelity. Also rarely studied are overt behavioral responses, but they are
certainly also an important part of real-world responses to partner infidelity. For example,
research suggests that infidelity is the most common presenting problem for dating and
married couples entering therapy (Glass and Wright, 1988) and the leading cause of divorce
(Amato and Previti, 2003). Thus, examining attitudes toward partner infidelity is arguably a
more thorough approach than asking about specific emotional reactions, in terms of
understanding overall reactive tendencies. Moreover, it is also a much more efficient
approach compared to separately measuring affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses.
Prior studies have assessed attitudes toward personally engaging in infidelity, or
attitudes toward infidelity in general, and if such attitudes relate to behavior. Not
surprisingly, those who have personally had "extra-relationship involvements" tend to have
more positive attitudes and more likely intend to engage in such relationships again in the
future (Drake and McCabe, 2000; Thompson, 1984). Similarly, attitudes toward
"extradyadic sex" predict personal involvement and willingness to engage in future
extradyadic relationships (Buunk and Bakker, 1995). In a study examining gender
differences in attitudes toward reasons for extramarital relationships, Glass and Wright
(1992) found that men have more positive attitudes toward sexual justifications for their
own extramarital relationships, but women report more positive attitudes toward
justifications for emotional relationships. Although these studies support the general
prediction of sex differences in attitudes toward infidelity, we know of no previous study
that has specifically examined attitudes toward partner infidelity.
In the present study we examined men and women's attitudes toward partner sexual
and emotional infidelity. To put our results in context with previous studies, we also sought
to replicate previous findings of relative sex differences in infidelity distress (Carpenter,
2012; Sagarin et al., 2012). Consistent with evolutionary predictions and the findings of
recent meta-analyses, we expected the results from the attitude scales to be in line with
those from the infidelity distress measures. Specifically, we hypothesized that relative to
women, men's attitudes toward partner sexual infidelity would be significantly more
negative than their attitudes toward partner emotional infidelity.
Materials and Methods
Participants
University students (N = 324) aged 18 years or older (212 females, 112 males) were
recruited from an introductory psychology participant pool. Most were White (87.3%),
heterosexual (93.2%), and of traditional college student age (M = 19.78 years, SD = 4.02).
The Institutional Review Board at Ball State University approved this study.

Measures
Forced-choice infidelity distress. Following Buss et al. (1992), participants were
asked to think of a serious committed relationship they have had in the past, are currently
having, or would like to have and then to imagine that they discover their partner is
involved with someone else. They were then asked to select which scenario they would
find more distressing: Imagining their partner (a) has formed a deep emotional attachment
with someone else, or (b) engaging in sexual intercourse with someone else.
Continuous infidelity distress. As in the forced-choice measure, participants were
asked to think about a serious committed relationship and then to imagine that they
discover their partner is involved with someone else. They rated on 5-point, endpoint-only
labeled scales (1 = not distressing, 5 = very distressing) how distressed they would be if
"You discover that your partner is engaging in sexual intercourse with someone else," and
if "You discover that your partner has formed a deep emotional attachment with someone
else".
Attitude scales. Participants rated "your romantic partner having sexual intercourse
with another person" and "your romantic partner forming a deep emotional attachment to
another person" separately on five 7-point semantic differential scales: good­bad, positive­
negative, natural­unnatural, pleasant­unpleasant, and acceptable­unacceptable. Responses
were averaged, with higher scores indicating more favorable attitudes. Internal reliability
was good for both the sexual ( = .85) and emotional ( = .91) scales.
Procedure
Participants responded to the measures (presented in counterbalanced order) either
in person in small, mixed gender sessions (n = 73) or online (n = 251). When included in
the analyses reported below, no significant effects of in-person vs. online administration
were found. The infidelity distress scales were always presented consecutively (with
forced-choice and continuous formats being counterbalanced), and the attitude scales were
always presented consecutively (with sexual and emotional infidelity counterbalanced). A
demographic questionnaire was always presented last.
Results
Descriptive statistics and correlations are displayed in Table 1. Responses to the
forced-choice distress measure were significantly correlated with scores on the continuous
measure of distress to partner emotional infidelity, but not with scores on the continuous
measure of distress to partner sexual infidelity. Attitudes toward partner infidelity were
moderately and significantly correlated with continuous distress ratings, but not with the
forced-choice measure.
Replication of gender differences in infidelity distress
Consistent with previous research employing forced-choice measures with college
students, a 2 (Participant Gender)  2 (Sexual or Emotional Infidelity selected as most
distressing) chi-square test of independence was significant, 2 (1, N = 324) = 36.36, p <
.001,  = .34. The majority (80.7%) of women chose emotional infidelity as more
distressing, but 51.8% of men chose sexual infidelity as more distressing.

To test for sex differences on the continuous measures of infidelity distress, a 2
(Participant Sex)  2 (Infidelity Type: Sexual vs. Emotional) ANOVA with repeated
measures on the second factor was performed. A main effect was found such that women
(M = 4.78, SD = 0.52) reported more distress than men (M = 4.50, SD = 0.83), F(1, 322) =
21.60, p < .001, d = 0.40, p
2 = .06. A main effect was also found for infidelity type, with
partner sexual infidelity (M = 4.76, SD = 0.58) rated more distressing than emotional
infidelity (M = 4.61, SD = 0.74), F(1, 322) = 19.08, p < .001, d = 0.23, p
2 = .06. However,
these main effects were qualified by a significant Participant Sex  Infidelity Type
interaction, F(1, 322) = 12.61, p < .001, p
2 = .04. Importantly, this interaction was in the
evolutionary theory supportive direction: Men rated sexual infidelity significantly more
distressing (M = 4.69, SD = 0.74) than they rated emotional infidelity (M = 4.32, SD =
0.92), F(1, 322) = 23.96, p < .001, d = 0.44, 95% CI [0.33, 0.55], but there was little
difference between women's ratings of sexual (M = 4.80, SD = 0.48) and emotional
infidelity (M = 4.76, SD = 0.57), F(1, 322) = 0.48, p = .29, d = 0.08, 95% CI [0.03, 0.13].
Sex differences in attitudes
To examine attitudes toward partner infidelity, a 2 (Participant Sex)  2 (Infidelity
Type: Sexual vs. Emotional) ANOVA with repeated measures on the second factor was
conducted. A main effect was found such that women (M = 1.75, SD = 0.86) reported
significantly more negative attitudes toward partner infidelity than men (M = 2.05, SD =
1.03), F(1, 322) = 11.18, p < .001, d = 0.32, p
2 = .03. A main effect was also found for
Infidelity Type, with sexual infidelity (M = 1.41, SD = 0.65) rated significantly more
negatively than emotional infidelity (M = 2.29, SD = 1.23), F(1, 322) = 191.85, d = 0.89, p
< .001, p
2 = .37. However, these main effects were qualified by a significant Participant
Sex  Infidelity Type interaction, F (1, 322) = 14.99, p < .001, p
2 = .04. As expected, men
rated sexual infidelity (M = 1.44, SD = 0.70) more negatively than they rated emotional
infidelity (M = 2.66, SD = 1.37), F(1, 322) = 120.00, p < .001, d = 1.12, 95% CI [0.99,
1.26]. Although women also rated sexual infidelity (M = 1.40, SD = 0.62) more negatively
than they rated emotional infidelity (M = 2.09, SD = 1.10), this difference was not as large
and thus in the evolutionary theory supportive direction, F(1, 322) = 72.03, p < .001, d =
0.77, 95% CI [0.69, 0.85].

Supplementary Analyses
As noted by a reviewer to an earlier version of this manuscript, examination of the
means and standard deviations in the preceding analyses suggests the continuous measures
are skewed. Indeed, the skew was most evident for the continuous distress scores (skew = -
2.70, -2.09 for sexual and emotional infidelity distress, respectively), but also was observed
for the attitude scores (skew = 2.49, 0.98 toward sexual and emotional infidelity,
respectively). Given the concern that these deviations from normality violate the
assumptions of the ANOVAs and thus affected the results (p values), we also performed
non-parametric tests of our hypotheses. To do so we first computed the difference between
participants' sexual and emotional infidelity distress ratings (also see Tagler and Gentry,
2011), and the corresponding difference between participants' attitudes toward sexual and
emotional infidelity. These difference scores represent the within-subjects factor (infidelity
type) in the previously reported ANOVAs. As expected, for distress to partner infidelity the
sexual ­ emotional difference was more pronounced for men (M = 0.37, SD = 0.94) than
for women (M = 0.03, SD = 0.70). Likewise, the sexual ­ emotional difference in attitudes
was also more pronounced for men (M = -1.21, SD = 1.38) than for women (M = -0.71, SD
= 1.05).
First, we performed the Mann-Whitney procedure on the difference scores.
Consistent with evolutionary theory and our ANOVA results, the test revealed a significant
relative sex difference in partner infidelity distress ratings, U = 9575.50, z = 3.42, p = .001,
r = -.19, and also in attitudes toward partner infidelity, U = 9408.00, z = -3.09, p = .002, r =
-.17. In addition, we performed permutation tests using Howell's (2007) resampling
program. Specifically, we determined the probability of obtaining relative sex differences
more extreme than what we obtained under the null hypothesis that participant sex has no
relation to reactions to partner infidelity. To do so, 100,000 resamples of the data were
performed. Consistent with ANOVA results, the probability of obtaining our infidelity
distress results (t = 3.55) was unlikely, with only 43 out of 100,000 (p = .00043) resampled
results as extreme. Likewise, the probability of obtaining our attitude results (t = -3.61) was
extremely rare, with just 36 out of 100,000 (p = .00036) resampled results as extreme.
Discussion
Across all measures, we found relative sex differences in reactions to partner
infidelity. On both forced choice and continuous measures of distress, men were
significantly more likely, compared to women, to perceive partner sexual infidelity as more
distressing than emotional infidelity. Furthermore, and the unique aspect of the present
study, men and women reported differences in their attitudes toward partner infidelity.
Men, to a significantly larger degree than women, evaluated partner sexual infidelity more
negatively than emotional infidelity. In combination, these results are consistent with the
evolutionary perspective (Sagarin et al., 2012).
As has been the case with research examining sex differences in jealousy and
distress, the present attitude results may be interpreted differently depending on one's
theoretical allegiance, and on what one subsequently views as the critical comparisons. If
past trends hold, social-cognition theorists are likely to exclusively focus on simple effects
Sex differences in attitudes toward infidelity

within participant sex (e.g., Carpenter, 2012), ignore the significant Participant Sex 
Infidelity type interaction, and conclude that there are no sex differences in attitudes merely
because both men and women evaluated sexual infidelity more negatively than emotional
infidelity. This interpretation, in effect, demands a disordinal (i.e., crossover) interaction as
evidence for the evolutionary perspective and ignores the actually obtained, statistically
significant result: Men reported a significantly larger difference in their attitudes toward the
two forms of infidelity. To date, social-cognitive theorists have not yet addressed the
empirically robust Participant Sex  Infidelity Type interaction (Sagarin et al., 2012). At
the very least, the social-cognitive perspective is incomplete without an acknowledgement
of the robust, albeit ordinal, Participant Sex  Infidelity Type interaction.
It is important to acknowledge that the pattern of relative sex differences differed
across our three outcome measures. On the forced-choice distress item, the large majority
of women chose emotional infidelity as the more distressing form of partner infidelity,
whereas men were approximately evenly split in their choice. In contrast, on the continuous
distress scales, men reported significantly more distress to sexual infidelity than they did to
emotional infidelity, but women's ratings of the two forms of infidelity were similar. On
the attitude scales, both men and women evaluated sexual infidelity more negatively than
emotional infidelity, but the difference was larger for men. Nonetheless, it is important to
again emphasize that each of the outcomes was in the evolutionary theory supportive
direction: Men, relative to women, reacted more negatively to partner sexual infidelity than
to emotional infidelity. Critically, these results are thus fully consistent with both the
Carpenter (2012) and Sagarin et al. (2012) meta-analyses. As such, we believe the present
results provide strong evidence for the evolutionary perspective.
But, why the different patterns? Although the specific additional influences are
unclear and should be investigated in future studies, it is logical to conclude that there are
also situational and individual difference factors that influence reaction to partner infidelity.
In any given study, some of these factors may increase or decrease the degree to which
men's reactions differ from women's. But as clearly argued by Sagarin et al. (2012),
selection pressures were influenced by reproductive competitions that were intrasexual, and
as a result the evolutionary perspective does not imply that men's evolved sensitivities to
sexual infidelity are necessarily always greater than women's responses to sexual infidelity.
Likewise, women's evolved sensitivities to emotional infidelity are not necessarily always
greater than men's. Rather, selection pressures altered the relative patterns of responses to
both forms of infidelity, produced in different situations. Sagarin et al. (2012) note that "it
would be foolish to think that sexually dimorphic selection pressures comprised the only
factor impacting responses" (p. 597). Much like the now cliché nature-nurture debate,
entrenched "either-or" debates concerning the veracity of evolutionary versus social-
cognitive explanations are disruptive to progress. Instead, more research attention should
be devoted to understanding the factors that sometimes lead to men and women reacting
with more similarity to a given form of partner infidelity. Based on previous findings,
possible moderators include participant age, socioeconomic status, household size, and the
finding that sex differences are largest among U.S. college student samples (Carpenter,
2012; Sagarin et al., 2012; Zengel, Edlund, and Sagarin, 2013).

Focusing more on the unique contribution of the present study with an eye toward
future research, the results indicate that an attitude approach may prove useful. As overall
evaluative tendencies, attitudes are reflective of not only affective, but also cognitive, and
behavioral experiences. Arguably then, measuring attitudes may be both a more thorough
and efficient approach to the study of sex differences in reactions to partner infidelity. A
limitation at this point is the inability to determine the basis of sex differences in attitudes.
It is possible, for example, that the attitude differences reported here are mostly the result
of emotional responses to partner infidelity. However, as shown in Table 1, we found
attitudes toward sexual and emotional infidelity to be only moderately correlated with
responses to the corresponding continuous measures of distress (rs = -.37, -.40), and very
weakly correlated with choices on the forced choice distress item (rs = -.04, .10). Thus, we
speculate that attitudes toward partner infidelity would be better predicted by a combination
of emotions, cognitions, and behaviors. Moreover, perhaps it is the cognitive and
behavioral components of attitudes that account for the finding that men and women both
report more negative attitudes toward partner sexual infidelity than toward emotional
infidelity. Specifically, attributions for infidelity (cognition) are likely correlated with
attitudes toward partner infidelity, but men and women may differ in the circumstances that
lead to given attributions. Given that previous research has shown older, infidelity-
experienced adults respond differently to infidelity distress measures (Sagarin et al., 2012;
Tagler, 2010), it would be interesting to examine how previous relationship experiences
relate to men and women's attitudes. Particularly powerful would be longitudinal research
that examines reactions to partner infidelity over time (Kimeldorf, 2009), to identify the
degree to which evolutionary-predicted sex differences in attitudes persist and the affective,
cognitive, and behavioral factors that predict change.
A final finding of the present study that deserves comment is that responses to the
continuous distress scales were rather weakly correlated with choices on the forced-choice
distress item (rs = .10, -.20). We sought to compare these results with those of previous
studies, but unfortunately few have reported the correlation between forced-choice and
continuous infidelity distress measures. One exception is Tagler (2010) who, in contrast,
found moderate-sized correlations (rs = .47, -.48). However, a more recent study by Tagler
and Gentry (2011) found relationships more similar to the present results (rs = .18, -.16).
We do not at the present have an explanation for these discrepant findings, but to put them
in the proper context it is important to understand that the continuous and forced-choice
infidelity distress measures differ in an important way beyond mere question format.
Whereas the forced-choice question requires participants to make a single, relative
judgment regarding sexual versus emotional partner infidelity, the continuous scales are
designed to separately assess reactions to the two forms of infidelity, in effect allowing
participants to report similar or even identical levels of distress to both. It is only in the
context of a data analytic procedure that the researcher formally assesses the relative
difference in reactions to sexual versus emotional infidelity on continuous scales. Given
this logic, arguably a more appropriate approach is to first quantify the differences in
responses to the continuous distress scales (sexual ­ emotional), and then correlate these
difference scores with choices on the forced-choice question. When doing so in the present
study, we found a larger, statistically significant relationship, r(323) = .25, p < .001. This

result is similar to that recently reported (r = .33) by Tagler and Gentry (2011). More data
is needed to understand the unique properties of continuous and forced-choice measures of
reactions to partner infidelity, and their relationship.
In conclusion, the present research was the first to document relative sex differences
in attitudes toward partner infidelity. The pattern of this overall evaluative sex difference is
consistent with the evolutionary account of sexually dimorphic selection pressures, and also
with previous research focusing on emotional reactions to partner sexual versus emotional
infidelity. Continued research on attitudes toward partner infidelity has the potential to
increase our understanding of sex differences by focusing on the affective, cognitive, and
behavioral differences in men and women's reactions to partner infidelity.
