Introduction
In Japan, the number of 18-year-olds has been steadily
decreasing since the 1990s. As the number of possible candi-
dates diminishes, many schools had to compete for new stu-
dents by diversifying the entrance selection methods and
often lowering their entrance academic standards. According
to Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science
and Technology (2012), 92% of students who applied for
junior colleges, colleges, or universities managed to enter
those schools, while only 62% had succeeded in 1990. This
has left many universities having to deal with students who
are not academically ready for university studies. Ishii,
Shiina, Maeda, and Yanai (2007) reported that 87% of the
11,481 university teachers surveyed recognized declining
ability among students. Of the 87%, 53% felt that this decline
was causing some problems, and nearly 8% felt that the
problem was serious enough to disrupt operation of classes.
In addition to the lowered academic standards for incoming
university students, changes in Japan's English education
seemed to have affected students' basic knowledge of
English. The new Courses of Studies for junior and senior
high school English courses, which emphasize communica-
tion, was introduced in 1996. Saita (2003), who tracked pre-
fectural English examination results of entering high school
students from 1995 to 2002 reported that English proficiency
levels steadily declined during the 8 years, with the biggest
drop in 1998, when new students who went through all 3
years of junior high school education under the new Courses
of Study. According to a report by National Institute of
Multimedia Education, of approximately 3,500 incoming
university freshmen at 26 different schools who took their
English placement test, only 24% of non-English major stu-
dents at private universities had high school graduate level of
English proficiency, and 33% had less than junior high
school graduate level (Ono, 2005). These reports are based
on paper-based tests on vocabulary and grammar (Saita,
2003) and listening, vocabulary, grammar, and reading (Ono,
2005), so they do not directly reflect the communication
skills of the test takers. However, there is little data suggest-
ing improved English communication proficiency of
Japanese university students, and with declined ability on
basic vocabulary and grammar, it does not seem reasonable
to hope that communication skills alone may have improved
(Shite, 2007). The problem here may be that communication-
oriented English education replaced the more traditional
grammar instructions instead of being added to it.

Exploring Metalinguistic Knowledge of
Low to Intermediate Proficiency EFL
Students in Japan
Miki Tokunaga1
Abstract
In line with recent studies recognizing positive correlation between metalinguistic knowledge and language proficiency,
this study aimed to find out how much metalanguage is understood by low to intermediate proficiency English as a Foreign
Language (EFL) learners in Japan. A very simple metalanguage test was designed and administered to 1,180 non-English majors
at two Japanese private universities. Some of the participants' metalinguistic ability was compared with their standardized
test scores. For 639 participants who took the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) Bridge® test, their
reading scores and their metalinguistic ability showed the strongest correlations (r = .66), and for 87 participants whose
scores from the Visualizing English Language Competency (VELC) test were available, the strongest correlation between the
two tests was also with the reading section (r = .80). The results revealed that even very simple metalanguage, such as noun,
adverb, and article, was not recognized by many of the participants.

Extensive amount of research on effects of different types
of classroom instructions on language acquisition was con-
ducted in the 1980s and 1990s, and Norris and Ortega (2001)
conducted research synthesis and meta-analysis of 77 studies
published in 21 different journals and a number of edited
books published between 1980 and 1998. Comparisons of
average effect sizes from 49 studies with sufficient data indi-
cated that "focused L2 instructional treatments consistently
outperformed a range of control/comparison or baseline con-
ditions by an average of nearly one standard deviation unit (d =
0.96)" (p. 192), and in both Focus on Form or Focus on
Forms interventions, "treatments involving an explicit focus
on the rule-governed nature of L2 structures are more effec-
tive than treatments that do not include such focus" (p. 195).
Japanese students have little opportunity to use or be
exposed to English outside the classes. In a survey of 3,700
high school students (Benesse, 2006), only 6% answered
they have ever spoken on the phone in English, 18% have
written an email in English, and 21% have read something on
the Internet written in English. In such an English as a
Foreign Language (EFL) environment, explicit instructions
play a crucial role to maximize learners' language acquisi-
tion through practice. In university English classes, difficulty
arises when the students lack basic knowledge assumed by
teachers to have been covered in junior and senior high
schools. These students not only lack English proficiency,
but they also struggle to understand metalanguage used to
describe the target language in classrooms and in textbooks.
Metalinguistic knowledge is "knowledge of technical
terms such as `verb complement' and semi-technical linguis-
tic terms such as `sentence'and `clause'" (Ellis, 2009, p. 38).
While some difficult terms are avoidable, some metalan-
guage is necessary, especially if high-stake proficiency tests
assess grammatical accuracy. For example, this study's par-
ticipants at University A had to take the Test of English for
International Communication (TOEIC) Bridge® test for
their compulsory English classes, and the result of the test
accounted for 20% of the grade and was the deciding factor
for the following year's English class placement. Part 4 of
the test has 30 multiple choice sentence completion ques-
tions, two examples from an official TOEIC Bridge® work-
book (Educational Testing Service, 2008) being,
1. There are many ( ) accents in England.
a. regions b. regional c. region d. regionally
2. The flowers in the window box have ( ) three inches in the last
week.
a. grown b. grew c. grow d. growth. (p. 53)
To explain the answers for such questions, metalanguage
is essential. English translations of the explanations given in
the workbook are as follows:
1. As the blank is followed by a noun accents, it requires
an adjective regional to modify the noun.
2. The phrase in the last week at the end of the sentence
indicates a period of time in the past, and the have in
front of the blank shows that it is a present perfect
sentence. Present perfect tense is have + past partici-
ple, thus the past participle grown is required.
Without basic metalinguistic knowledge such as noun,
adjective, and present perfect, learners will have difficulty
understanding explanations by teachers and textbooks for
such test items. Before metalanguage can be used to describe
another language, metalanguage itself needs describing and
explaining to be understood by the audience (Berry, 2005).
Many recent studies investigating correlations between
language proficiency and metalinguistic knowledge have
found positive correlations between the two. Elder and
Manwaring (2004) found significant correlations (r = .69-
.76) between an L2 metalinguistic knowledge test and L2
class achievement of students who were studying Chinese at
a university in Australia. Renou (2001), in her study of 64
university-level learners of French, compared the results of
oral and written grammaticality judgment tests and a French
proficiency test. Highest correlations were found between
their judgment tests and cloze sections of proficiency tests,
which tested learners' knowledge of vocabulary, grammar,
and structure. Roehr (2008) compared the results of a German
language test and a metalanguage test given to 60 university
students studying German at a British university and found a
strong correlation (r = .81). Elder (2009) compared the
results of English metalinguistic knowledge tests and three
English language proficiency tests: computer-based Test of
English as a Foreign Language (TOEFLCBT); the Diagnostic
English Language Needs Assessment (DELNA), used at the
University of Auckland; and International English Language
Testing System (IELTS). Correlations were significant with
DELNA's reading component (r = .36), all parts of IELTS,
especially the reading section (r = .54), and all parts of
TOEFL CBT® (listening r = .49, reading r = .57, structure/
writing r = .57, and total r = .61).
Although many of these previous studies measured meta-
linguistic knowledge through learners' ability to find and/or
describe errors in ungrammatical sentences alone or in addi-
tion to their ability to identify parts of speech, the first pro-
cess may be too difficult for low-proficiency L2 learners.
Iida, Teele, and Kuwayama (2005) found that their metalan-
guage test, which asked the participants to find, correct, and
describe errors in sentences, was too difficult for low inter-
mediate participants with an average TOEIC® score of 414.
As the English proficiency level of the participants of this
study ranged from very low to intermediate level, a simpler
metalanguage test was necessary.
Research Questions
This study aimed to investigate the following two research
questions:
Tokunaga 3
Research Question 1: Is there a correlation between
English proficiency test scores and metalinguistic knowl-
edge among low to intermediate proficiency Japanese
university students?
Research Question 2: What metalinguistic features can
be recognized by low to intermediate proficiency Japanese
university students?
Research Method
Participants
A metalanguage test was administered to more than 1,200
first and second year non-English majors at two private
Japanese universities. English is a compulsory subject in
Japanese secondary schools, so the participants have had at
least 6 years of formal English education. Removing non-
Japanese students, those who only completed the first page
of the double-sided test form, and those who did not sign the
consent form left 1,180 participants.
Metalanguage Test
The metalanguage test developed by the author had 36 items
in four sections: (a) parts of speech; (b) parts of sentences;
(c) tenses, voices, and moods; and (d) other. Participants
were asked to look at English sentences and choose a term
which best described the underlined part or the whole sen-
tence as below:
Choose the name of parts of speech for the underlined
word. Some choices may be used more than once, and some
choices may not be used at all.
(A) noun (B) verb (C) adjective (D) adverb (E) auxiliary
verb (F) article (G) preposition (H) conjunction (I) I don't
know
1. Tom is a teacher. 2. Tom is a teacher.
For University B, whose students were expected to have
a higher English proficiency than students at University A,
another section with 10 items was added. This section was
conducted as a pilot for further research on the relationship
between metalinguistic knowledge and grammaticality
judgment test. Following the format used in Elder (2009),
and with possibility of increasing the number of partici-
pants in future study in mind, multiple choice format was
used. Participants were asked to look at the underlined
parts of English sentences and choose an answer which
most appropriately describes the error in each sentence as
below:
Some sentences below are grammatically incorrect.
Choose the most appropriate explanation of the error for
each sentence. Some choices may be used more than once,
and some choices may not be used at all. (See Table 6 for
answer choices.)
1. I have a friend who brother is a famous singer.
2. If I see Tom tomorrow, I will ask him about it.
Answer choices included "the sentence is grammatically cor-
rect," and 4 of the 10 sentences were in fact correct.
Instructions and answer choices were given in Japanese,
as the purpose of this study was to assess the participants'L2
(English) metalinguistic knowledge in L1 (Japanese). Most
of the metalinguistic terms tested were sampled from the
TOEIC Bridge® official workbook (Educational Testing
Service, 2008) and the TOEIC Bridge® official preparation
guide (Educational Testing Service, 2002), both of which
gave explanations for questions in Japanese. Additional
terms that were closely related to the terms used in those
books were added. All items were multiple choice questions
testing receptive knowledge of metalanguage without any
productive items, as Ellis (2004) points out that measuring
receptive rather than productive knowledge of metalanguage
may have greater validity because "it is learners'understand-
ing of explicit linguistic constructs rather than their ability to
articulate metalinguistic rules that is important where lan-
guage acquisition and use are concerned" (p. 267). The same
answer choices were used for all questions in each section,
and all sections' answer choices included I don't know to
minimize the effect of guessing. Students were encouraged
to choose I don't know as the results were intended not only
for research but also to understand students' needs in class-
room and textbook terminology.
Only simple, high-frequency words were used to mini-
mize test difficulty. A vocabulary analysis using Vocabulary
Profile (Cobb, n.d.; Heatley & Nation, 1994) showed that the
test consisted mostly of words from the first 1,000 (87%) and
second 1,000 (6%) word bands of the General Service List
(West, 1953). Although the rest (7%) were categorized as
off-list words, these were Tom, New York, movies, and com-
mon Japanese names Keiko, Tama, and Yumiko. It is unlikely
that these interfered with participants understanding of the
sentences.
English Proficiency Tests
All first and second year students at UniversityAtook TOEIC
Bridge® test as a schoolwide achievement test, and scores of
639 participants were available for this study.TOEIC Bridge®
is a test developed to assess basic everyday communication
skills of beginner and intermediate level learners (Institute for
International Business Communication, 2012). For 86 partici-
pants from University B, their scores from VELC (Visualizing
English Language Competency) test were available. VELC
test is a new standardized test recently developed especially
to evaluate English proficiency of Japanese university stu-
dents (Shizuka & Mochizuki, 2013).

Results and Discussion
Rasch Analysis
Rasch analysis using the Winsteps® software package
(Linacre, 2010) was conducted on the data from the metalan-
guage test. Rasch analysis produces measures of item diffi-
culty and person ability on a common equal interval scale
measured in log-odds units, or logits. Figure 1 shows the
Winsteps variable map with persons ranked by ability on the
left and items by difficulty on the right. A position higher on
the scale represents greater ability for a person or greater dif-
ficulty for an item. When person ability precisely matches
item difficulty, the person has a 50% expectation of success.
The M on each side of the axis shows the mean of person
ability and item difficulty. Participants' mean ability was
higher than mean item difficulty, and it can be seen that per-
sons are distributed a little higher than items. As this test was
intended to measure metalanguage recognition by low to
intermediate proficiency learners, the scarcity of more diffi-
cult items does not significantly affect the quality of this
study. All this means is that higher proficiency students did
not have problems with the metalanguage that appeared in
this metalanguage test.
Correlations With Proficiency Tests
The 639 participants' TOEIC Bridge® test total scores
ranged from 64 to 164 with a mean of 117.0 and a standard
deviation of 19.8. According to Educational Testing Service
(2006), 110 to 120 on TOEIC Bridge® is considered equiva-
lent to 280 to 310 on TOEIC®. The 86 participants' VELC
test total scores ranged from 326 to 583, with a mean of
444.1 and a standard deviation of 58.4. Although VELC test
can only be converted to TOEIC® scores individually using
all six sub-scores of the two section test, their conversion
guideline (Research group for VELC, 2013) shows that 500
and 400 on VELC tests are approximately 450 and 330 on
TOEIC® tests, showing that the average English proficiency
of those 86 participants from University B is higher than that
of the average English proficiency of 639 from University A.
A Pearson correlation was used to analyze the correlations
between the participants'measures from the metalanguage test
and listening, reading and total scores from theTOEIC Bridge®
test and VELC test. Moderate to high correlations were found
between the metalanguage test results and all sections of both
proficiency tests (Table 1). In accordance with findings from
previous studies (Elder, 2009; Elder & Manwaring, 2004;
Renou, 2001; Roehr, 2008), the highest correlations were found

with the reading sections (r = .66 for the TOEIC Bridge group;
r = .80 for the VELC group), which includes items testing
knowledge of grammar and vocabulary.
Parts of Speech Items
Table 2 lists the results of the parts of speech section of the
metalanguage test from the most difficult to the easiest item.
The two most difficult items were slowly in "The teacher
speaks slowly" and well in "Yumiko can speak English well."
The most common erroneous response for both the adverb
items was adjective. There were two items testing for adjec-
tives, kind in "The teacher is kind" and small in "There is a
small box on the desk." Although the difficulties of those
items were not as high as the adverb items, they were com-
monly mistaken for adverbs. This confusion between adjec-
tives and adverbs may be considered negligible, especially
for the low-proficiency learners. However, the difference is
often tested in English proficiency tests such as TOEIC® and
TOEIC Bridge®. Also, because of the non-saliency of the
differences in their forms and the redundancy to sentence
meanings, they are difficult to be noticed by learners, requir-
ing instruction for more successful language learning
(Schmidt, 1993, 2001).
The third most difficult item was the in "The box is small"
with only 804 correct responses out of 1,180. The most com-
mon wrong response was preposition, probably because those
are also small function words. The difficulty of using English
articles by Japanese learners has long been recognized and
researched (e.g., Akamatsu & Tanaka, 2008; Butler, 2002;
Yamada & Matsuura, 1982). However, because of the diffi-
culty, special attention is usually given in teaching of articles.
It seems futile trying to teach or learn how to use articles
when the learners do not know which words are articles, espe-
cially when there are only three of them: a, an, and the.
There were two auxiliary verb items, "I will call you
tomorrow" and "Yumiko can speak English well," and they
were the fifth and sixth most difficult items in this section.
The preposition on in "There is a small box on the desk" was
one of the easiest items in this section with 967 correct
responses. The easiest items in this section were the three
nouns, but even those did not have 100% recognition. While
1,152 participants correctly recognized the name Tom in
"Tom is a teacher" as a noun, correct responses for box in
"The box is small" decreased to 1,105, indicating that some
participants confuse nouns with names. The word teacher in
"Tom is a teacher" had even less correct responses, probably
because of the location of the word in the sentence. Some
participants seem to assume that nouns are always subjects.
Parts of Sentence Items
The parts of sentence section was included because the five
sentence patterns S (subject) + V (predicate verb), S + V + C
(complement), S + V + O (object), S + V + O + O, and S +
V + O + C are very commonly used in Japan to teach English
sentence structures. Table 3 lists the parts of sentence pat-
tern items in order of the most difficult to easiest. The seven
items only tested complements and objects because subjects
and predicate verbs were found to be too easy during pilot-
ing. The results show that the majority of participants had
difficulty distinguishing between complements and objects,
which probably requires grammatical knowledge rather than
metalinguistic knowledge alone. The bigger concern here is
lower ability participants choosing subjects and predicate
verbs, suggesting that those participants did not know what
subjects and verbs of sentences were. Whether the ability to
distinguish those five sentence patterns can help improve
learners' language skills is an issue beyond the scope of this
study, but not recognizing the names of these parts could
hinder learning, as they are very frequently used in
explanations.
Tense, Mood, and Voice Items
Table 4 lists items from the third section of the metalanguage
test: tenses, moods, and voices, also in order of item diffi-
culty. As expected, causative was the most difficult with only
127 correct responses and the highest difficulty of 3.39 logits
of the whole test. The most common erroneous response for
this item was past perfect (n = 844). As past perfect is usually
taught and memorized as "had + past participle," it is under-
standable that this item was wrongly recognized as one. At
the same time, this suggests the possible overgeneralization
of grammar terms, as we see more examples in this section.
There was another causative item, "She made her brother
clean her room," but this item was significantly easier than
the first item, possibly because of the presence of two peo-
ple. The common errors for this item was passive (n = 105)
and past perfect (n = 68). Distinction between sentences with
past participles seems to be the problem, as the passive sen-
tence "The book was written by a famous writer" and the
present perfect sentence "I have finished my lunch" both had
past perfect as the most common errors. These overgeneral-
izations could be a result of memorizing grammar rules with-
out enough input or meaningful output practices.

The second and third most difficult items were participle
construction sentences, one with a past participle and the
other with a present participle. For both items, many partici-
pants chose interrogative. Interrogative sentences were not
included as test items because the construction of interroga-
tive sentences, starting with a base form of a verb with no
subject, seemed too simple. However, the results suggest that
participle construction sentences were incorrectly recognized
as interrogative sentences because they do not have a subject
at the beginning and start with participles, which look like
verbs. Although not a very easy sentence structure for
Japanese learners of English to use, the subjunctive sentence
"If I were you, I would study harder" was the second easiest
item in this section and the fifth easiest in the whole test. The
presence of if has most likely helped the recognition.
The item with the lowest difficulty in this section was "I
will call you in the morning," with 1,113 out of 1,180 partici-
pants correctly recognizing it as a future sentence. If we look
back in the first section of the test, will as an auxiliary was not
so well recognized. While the item difficulty of will as a future

sentence was -3.07 logits, the difficulty of will as an auxiliary
was -0.69 logits. This suggests that future function of the
word will was more easily recognized than the grammar term
of it. This could be a result of more communication-focused
instruction in secondary schools, and understanding the mean-
ing is more useful than knowing the linguistic term of the
word. However, not knowing the grammatical function of the
word could mean that they are not able to generalize its usage
(i.e., will is followed by a base form of a verb, it is inverted to
the front of the sentence for questions, etc.) with other auxil-
iary verbs.
Other Items
The last section intentionally included items for which con-
fusion with similar terms were expected, and the results
(Table 5) were not surprising. The most difficult item in this
section was antecedent of a relative clause, "The woman
who is wearing a red dress is my sister," with only 383 cor-
rect responses. Not knowing the term antecedent probably
causes very little harm, and it can always be explained as
"the noun described by the relative clause." However,
among the wrong responses, overwhelming 511 chose sub-
ject pronoun, followed by 77 choosing possessive pronoun
and 62 choosing object pronoun, raising concerns for the
participants' understanding of pronouns. There were two
pronoun items in this section, he and his in "He has finished
his work." Even though the subject pronoun he was the
easiest item in this section, close to 150 participants
answered wrong with 53 choosing I don't know and 41
choosing antecedent. The possessive pronoun his, however,
was the third most difficult item in this section. While only
706 recognized it correctly, 243 chose object pronoun and
95 chose subject pronoun. Because there are only limited
number of pronouns, memorizing the terms and forms
would be worth more than the confusion and error caused
without the knowledge.
The second most difficult item in this section was watch-
ing in "I like watching movies" as a gerund, and as expected,
the most common wrong response was present participle.
The opposite error of choosing gerund for present participle
sleeping in the sentence "The baby is sleeping" was the
fourth most difficult item in this section. The fifth was fin-
ished in "He has finished his work." The verb with the same
past and participle forms was chosen intentionally, and it was
indeed confused with the past form. The opposite case with
slept in "The baby slept all night" as a past form of the verb
had 275 participants choose past participle. The confusion
was also tested with a verb with different forms of past and
past participle, written in "The book was written by a famous
writer" but this was the second least difficult item in this sec-
tion. The last set of items in this section was the word who as
an interrogative and a relative pronoun in "The woman who
is wearing a red dress is my sister" and "Who is that woman?"
respectively. As expected, those two terms were mistaken for
each other, with 84 responding as interrogative for relative
pronoun, and 71 doing the opposite.
Grammaticality Judgment Section
This last section of 10 items were only given to participants
from University B (n = 524). Table 6 shows, as expected, 10
grammaticality judgment items had higher item difficulties.
The most difficult item was an error in participle construc-
tion sentence, "Look out the window of a bus, Keiko saw a
car accident." However, there were 79 erroneous responses
choosing "the verb should be a gerund," which would pro-
duce the same form as the correct response, "the verb should
be a present participle form." The same can be said for the
fifth difficult item, "Tom is going to have his car fix." There
were 32 responses choosing to change the verb to its past
form, which is the same as its past participle form.
The second most difficult item in this section was an item
correcting a verb tense in a subjunctive sentence, "If you

have a lot of money, what would you buy?" with an item dif-
ficulty of 2.43 logits. There was also one correct subjunctive
sentence in this section, but many participants wanted to
change the tense of the verb, making its item difficulty 1.49
logits. This suggests that even if a subjunctive sentence with
if was easy to recognize with an item difficulty of -1.89 log-
its (Table 4), correct structures of subjunctive sentences may
not be well understood by the participants of this study.
Something similar can be said for relative pronoun, which
was easy to recognize with an item difficulty of -1.07 logits
in the previous section (Table 5). The erroneous responses
for three relative clause items in this section suggest that the
recognition of relative pronouns does not guarantee the
understanding of how they are used.
The causative sentences were found to be difficult to iden-
tify and were confused with perfect sentences in the previous
section (Table 4). In this section, the correct causative sen-
tence "I will have my staff call you by tomorrow night" was
the third most difficult item, and again, it was confused with
perfect sentence, with 78 participants wanting to change the
verb to its past participle form.
Conclusion and Implications
This research addressed two questions: Is there a correlation
between English proficiency test scores and metalinguistic
knowledge among low proficiency students, and what meta-
linguistic features can low proficiency students typically rec-
ognize? The results supported the findings of other recent
studies by Roehr (2008) and Elder (2009) of correlations
between metalinguistic knowledge and proficiency test
results in more advanced learners, and found significant cor-
relations between students' proficiency test scores and meta-
linguistic knowledge. The strongest correlation found with
both TOEIC Bridge® test and VELC test were with their
reading sections, also supporting previous findings. The
participants in this study had difficulty identifying basic
parts of speech and parts of sentences, and showed confusion
with similar sentence structures and other grammar terms,
suggesting that many of them lack the metalinguistic knowl-
edge to understand explanations given by teachers and text-
books done using similar metalanguage. Also, the results of
the grammaticality judgment items suggest that knowing the
metalanguage does not equal to full understanding of the
grammatical structures. This means that teaching of metalan-
guage for its own sake is of little use.
With that in mind, an important point to consider is which
metalanguage should be taught and used and which should
be avoided. With the spread of communicative language
teaching and the controversy over the effectiveness of
explicit instruction in the past, the use and knowledge of
metalanguage have "suffered increasing marginalization and
retreated from their former centrality" (Hu, 2011, p. 63).
However, as described in the previous sections, recent stud-
ies have shown correlations between learners' metalinguistic
knowledge and their general language proficiency. Hu
(2011), finding strong correlations (r = .72) between Chinese
English as a Second Language (ESL) learners' knowledge of
metalanguage and their ability to verbally describe English
grammar rules, suggests that "the availability of a working
metalanguage was an aid to, rather than a distracting influ-
ence on, the participants' internalization of explicit gram-
mar" (p. 73). When a student prepares for an important
proficiency test such as TOEIC®, which has a grammar
component, how can we explain why one of the answer
choices is correct without the use of some metalanguage?
How can we guide our students to write or speak more accu-
rately? Is it possible to avoid using metalanguage completely
and still give clear and precise explanations? Using metalan-
guage can also make it possible to generalize grammar rules
and allows the learner to apply the same rule in different sen-
tences with different words as Hu (2010) describes:

. . . the explanatory precision with which a metalinguistic
generalization can be made and the efficient delimitation of the
contexts to which the generalization applies. Metalingual terms
that are appropriately used can pre-empt both under-and
overgeneralization of the rules in question. (p. 181)
There are, however, cases in which the use of metalan-
guage can confuse more than assist. As several examples
showed in the results of the current metalanguage test, mis-
understanding and overgeneralization of grammar rules can
result from giving the rules without sufficient explanations
and examples. Also, some of the technical metalanguage,
such as antecedent, can easily be replaced with simpler
terms. Also, the terms past participle and present participle
could do more damage than good, as "present" participles
are not always used with present sentences and "past" parti-
ciples are not always used with past sentences. In this current
study, for example, 199 participants thought "I have finished
my lunch" was a past perfect sentence, most likely from the
past participle finished. For such terms that have confusing
names but are necessary in instruction, less-confusing names
that can still be commonly understood by both teachers and
learners may have to be established in class.
The findings in this study can support the importance of
metalanguage in second language acquisition, which has
been regaining attention (Elder, 2009; Elder & Manwaring,
2004; Hu, 2010, 2011; Iida et al., 2005; Renou, 2001; Roehr,
2008) in a field in which explicit grammar teaching has
somehow been sidelined in the shadow of communicative
language teaching. Recognizing the importance of metalan-
guage and explicit knowledge does not advocate the teaching
of metalanguage with the goal of learning metalanguage for
its own sake or a return to a teacher-centered grammar trans-
lation methodology. How much or how little metalanguage
should be used would vary in different situations, but what is
important is that the metalanguage used is understood by
everyone. Investigating metalinguistic knowledge of under-
graduates in Hong Kong, Berry (1997) found wide differ-
ences between learners in their knowledge, and wide
discrepancies between learners'knowledge and their English
teachers' expectations, which overestimated learners' actual
knowledge. Along with teaching learners necessary termi-
nology, he emphasizes the importance of giving awareness
training to teachers so they would realize that their classroom
language could be creating problems in their classrooms.
Having access to metalanguage "may help sharpen under-
standing of linguistic constructs" (Ellis, 2004, p. 240) by
allowing teachers and learners to talk about the target lan-
guage with more precision when explaining, clarifying, prac-
ticing, using, and reflecting on the use of the language in
different types of teaching and learning styles.
