OBJECTIVE -- To describe diet and exercise practices from a nationally representative sam-
ple of U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS -- We analyzed data from 1,480 adults older than 17 years with a self-reported
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III). Fruit and vegetable consumption was obtained from a food frequency question-
naire; the percentages of total calories from fat and saturated fat were obtained from a 24-h food
recall. Physical activity was based on self report during the month before the survey.
RESULTS -- Of individuals with type 2 diabetes, 31% reported no regular physical activity
and another 38% reported less than recommended levels of physical activity. Sixty-two percent
of respondents ate fewer than five servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Almost two thirds of
the respondents consumed 30% of their daily calories from fat and 10% of total calories from
saturated fat. Mexican Americans and individuals over the age of 65 years ate a higher number
of fruits and vegetables and a lower percentage of total calories from fat. Lower income and
increasing age were associated with physical inactivity. Thirty-six percent of the sample were
overweight and another 46% were obese.
CONCLUSIONS -- The majority of individuals with type 2 diabetes were overweight, did
not engage in recommended levels of physical activity, and did not follow dietary guidelines for
fat and fruit and vegetable consumption. Additional measures are needed to encourage regular
physical activity and improve dietary habits in this population.
Diabetes Care 25:1722­1728, 2002
Diet and exercise are considered im-
portant components of the treat-
ment strategy for adults with type 2
diabetes. Appropriate use of diet and ex-
ercise can improve insulin sensitivity and
glycemic control and decrease the need
for oral medications or insulin (1,2). Al-
though there is some controversy over the
optimal diet for adults with type 2 diabe-
tes (high fiber, glycemic index ap-
proaches, low versus moderate fat) (3,4),
there is a consensus to increase consump-
tion of fruits and vegetables and decrease
daily consumption of saturated fats (4,5).
Regular, moderate-intensity physical ac-
tivity for 30 min at least 5 times per week
is recommended for most Americans (6).
Previous studies suggest that individ-
uals with diabetes may not follow recom-
mended guidelines for diet and exercise,
although there have been no nationally
representative U.S. studies examining
nutritional intake among adults with type
2 diabetes. In a survey of 2,000 adults
with diabetes, the most frequently
reported barriers in diabetes self-
management were adherence to diet and
exercise (7). Only 60% of individuals
with diabetes in the National Health In-
terview Survey report that they "follow a
diabetic diet" (8), and several non-U.S.
studies have reported that actual nutrient
intake among individuals with diabetes
may be suboptimal (9­12). In addition,
the majority of individuals in the U.S.,
including those with diabetes, are not
meeting national physical activity goals
(13).
The purpose of this study is to de-
scribe both dietary intake and physical ac-
tivity from a nationally representative
sample of adults with type 2 diabetes. We
assessed compliance with national guide-
lines for physical activity (6,14) and total
fat, saturated fat, and fruit and vegetable
consumption (4,5). In addition, we exam-
ined the association of socioeconomic fac-
tors with diet and exercise practices. This
information will be critical to assess the
effectiveness of current clinical practice
and help identify groups at high risk for
poor dietary intake and physical inactiv-
ity.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), was conducted by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics at 89
U.S. survey locations between 1988 and
1994. The survey used a stratified, multi-
stage probability cluster design with over-
sampling of Mexican Americans, African
Americans, and the elderly to ensure min-
imum sample sizes of these populations.

The survey consists of multiple compo-
nents including a household interview, a
physical examination, and laboratory
tests. Descriptions of the standardized
protocols used for participant recruit-
ment, interviews, and examinations have
been previously published (15).
Information on a medical history of
diabetes was obtained during the house-
hold interview among all adults over the
age of 17 years (n  20,005). A total of
1,608 adults reported a diagnosis of dia-
betes. For this analysis, we excluded
women who were diagnosed with diabe-
tes only during pregnancy (n  105) and
individuals with type 1 diabetes, defined
as those who were diagnosed at 30 years
of age and who had continuous insulin
use since diagnosis (n  23). The remain-
ing 1,480 respondents were considered to
have type 2 diabetes. Based on previous
studies demonstrating that self-reported
diagnosis is valid and reliable, we believe
this sample accurately represents a na-
tional population of adults with type 2
diabetes (16,17). Individuals were con-
sidered to be treated with diet alone if
they reported taking neither oral hypogly-
cemic medications nor insulin.
Standing height and weight were ob-
tained during the physical exam for 1,312
individuals and were used to calculate
BMI. Individuals were considered obese if
their BMI was 30 kg/m2 and were con-
sidered overweight if their BMI was 25­
29.9 kg/m2 (18). HbA1c
values were
collected during the laboratory exam and
were available for 1,253 subjects.
Dietary assessment was based on data
from both the food frequency question-
naire and a 24-h food recall (19,20). Food
frequency information was collected dur-
ing the household interview and has been
shown to be a valid and reliable method
for assessing average consumption (19).
Respondents were asked how often over
the past month they had eaten the speci-
fied food items. Foods were reported as
number of items consumed per day, per
week, per month, or never. All frequen-
cies of consumption variables were stan-
dardized as times per day using the
conversion factor of 30.4 days/month. If
the frequency of consumption was re-
ported as "never," the value was recorded
as zero. For this analysis, we created a
combined variable for daily fruit and veg-
etable intake that includes all portions
from both the fruit and vegetable groups.
The fruit group included all fresh, frozen,
dried, and canned fruit and fruit juices
but excluded fruit drinks. The vegetable
group included all raw or cooked fresh,
frozen, or canned vegetables and juices
(19). Information on the percentage of
daily calories from total fat and saturated
fat was based on a 24-h food recall inter-
view. We used the cut points of five fruits
and vegetables per day, 30% of daily cal-
ories from fat, and 10% of daily calories
from saturated fat based on recommenda-
tions from national guidelines (4,5).
Individuals were classified as inactive
if they did not report engaging in any of
the following activities during the previ-
ous month: walking, jogging, bike riding,
swimming, aerobics, dancing, calisthen-
ics, gardening, lifting weights, or other
physical activity outside of their occupa-
tion. Physical activity was classified as
moderate or vigorous intensity based on
metabolic equivalent intensity levels (21).
Individuals were considered to fulfill na-
tional recommendations for physical ac-
tivity if they reported five or more
episodes per week of moderate-intensity
physical activity or three or more episodes
per week of vigorous-intensity physical
activity (6). Those reporting some physi-

cal activity during the preceding month
but not at the recommended levels were
classified as obtaining insufficient physi-
cal activity. To assess disability and im-
mobility, all respondents were asked if
they had difficulty "walking for a quarter
of a mile" and "walking up 10 steps with-
out resting" (13).
Data were weighted to account for the
unequal probability of selection that re-
sulted from the survey cluster design,
nonresponse, and oversampling of certain
target populations (22,23). Sampling
weights were used to calculate population
estimates, and sampling strata and pri-
mary sampling units were accounted for
to estimate variances and test for signifi-
cant differences. Statistical analysis was
performed using STATA 6.0 software (24)
to take into account the complex sam-
pling design. All results are presented as
unweighted counts (n) and weighted per-
centages and odds ratios.
Bivariate and multivariate logistic re-
gression analyses were used to determine
associations between socioeconomic and
health characteristics and 1) consumption
of fewer than five servings of fruits and
vegetables per day, 2) 30% of total cal-
ories from fat, 3) 10% of daily calories
from saturated fat, and 4) level of physical
activity. Pearson's 2 test was used to
compare bivariate associations between
socioeconomic and health characteristics
and these nutritional and physical activity
variables. Multivariate logistic analyses
were used to assess the independent asso-
ciations of socioeconomic and health
characteristics with obtaining no regular
physical activity, having a diet high in sat-
urated fats, and reporting low consump-
tion of fruits and vegetables.
RESULTS -- Table 1 displays the pop-
ulation characteristics from this nation-
ally representative sample of individuals
with type 2 diabetes. The mean age was
61 years, and the majority of the sample
was white. Almost one fifth had incomes
below the federal poverty level, and 45%
had less than a high school education.
Eighty-two percent of the sample had a
BMI 25 kg/m2, with 36% classified as
overweight and 46% as obese. Almost one
third of the sample reported no regular
physical activity in the month before the
survey, and another 38% reported an in-
sufficient amount of physical activity.
Forty-two percent of respondents re-
ported consumption of 30­40% of their
daily calories from fat, and 26% reported
intakes of 40% of their daily calories
from fat. Sixty-two percent of individuals
reported eating fewer than five servings of

consumed 10% of their daily calories
from saturated fats.
Bivariate associations between socio-
economic characteristics and level of
physical activity are displayed in Table 2.
Individuals over age 65 years, women,
Mexican Americans, African Americans,
and those using insulin were more likely
to report engaging in no physical activity.
Half of individuals with an income below
the poverty level and 40% of those with
less than a high school education reported
no physical activity. Of individuals who
reported no difficulty in walking a quar-
ter-mile or in walking 10 steps without
resting, 43% reported insufficient physi-
cal activity. BMI was not associated with
level of physical activity. In a multivariate
logistic regression, age  65 years, female
sex, and low income were independently
associated with inactivity (Table 4). Phys-
ical inactivity was not associated with
level of education, BMI, or type of diabe-
tes treatment in multivariate analyses.
When ability to walk a quarter-mile was
included in this multivariate model, age
was no longer independently associated
with reporting no physical activity (data
not shown).
Bivariate associations between nutri-
tional intake and socioeconomic and
health variables are displayed in Table 3.
Individuals 65 years were less likely to
consume a high-fat diet and more likely to
report eating more than five servings of
fruits and vegetables per day. There were
no associations between the three nutri-
tion intake variables and sex, education,
or type of diabetes treatment. In multivar-
iate analysis, individuals 65 years and
Mexican Americans were less likely to
consume 10% of their daily calories
from saturated fats and eat fewer than five
servings of fruits and vegetables per day
(Table 4).
CONCLUSIONS -- The majority of
adults with type 2 diabetes in this nation-
ally representative sample ate a diet high
in saturated fat and consumed fewer than
the minimum daily recommended serv-
ings of fruits and vegetables. In addition,
almost one third reported no regular
physical activity, and another 38% re-
ported insufficient levels of physical activ-
ity. Higher consumption of fruits and
vegetables and diets lower in fat were
more common among individuals over
the age of 65 years and among Mexican
Americans. Older individuals, women,
and those with low incomes were more
likely to report no regular exercise. The
majority of this sample was overweight or
obese, consistent with recent reports
about the increasing prevalence of both
diabetes and obesity in the U.S. (25).
The main limitations to this data are
the potential biases introduced by the
self-report of food frequency data, the
24-h food recall, and level of physical ac-
tivity. In addition, we do not know the
actual duration of physical activity. Previ-
ous studies have shown that white-collar
workers were more active during leisure

time than blue-collar workers, those who
were retired, or homemakers (26). Be-
cause we do not have information on non-
leisure physical activity, total activity
levels may be underestimated. Despite
these limitations, our study is consistent
with other national data from the general
U.S. population regarding poor dietary
quality (27­29) and low levels of physical
activity (30). The most recent Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
survey reported that almost one third of
adults did not engage in any physical ac-
tivity and another third were not regularly
active (30). In the National Health Inter-
view Survey from 1990, only one third of
people with diabetes reported exercising
regularly (13).
Although poor nutrient intake among
individuals with diabetes has been re-
ported outside of the U.S. (9­12), we are
not aware of any data on the dietary intake
from a nationally representative sample of
individuals with type 2 diabetes in the
U.S. Our results are consistent with stud-
ies of dietary intake in the general popu-
lation suggesting that a majority of
Americans are consuming an inadequate
quantity of fruits and vegetables (25,31).
Only one quarter of the participants inter-
viewed in the most recent BRFSS con-
sumed the recommended five servings of
fruits and vegetables (25). In addition,
our data regarding healthier diets among
Mexican Americans are consistent with
previous reports suggesting that on aver-
age, Latinos have healthier diets than
whites or African Americans (27,32,33).
Previous studies have reported low
levels of physical activity (13) and higher
levels of disability among individuals with
diabetes than in the general population
(34). Disability among individuals with
diabetes is primarily from coronary heart
disease and obesity, followed by poor vi-
sion (34). For individuals with significant
disability, an individualized program for
physical activity is essential. In our study,
individuals who reported the inability to
walk a quarter-mile were less likely to re-
port regular exercise. However, 40% of
those who reported that they could walk a
quarter-mile engaged in insufficient
physical activity and could be an impor-
tant target population for interventions to
increase exercise activity.
Healthy diets and regular physical ac-
tivity can improve glycemic control
among individuals with type 2 diabetes
(35­38). Intervention studies have shown
that physical activity plays an important
role in glucose tolerance and insulin sen-
sitivity (35). A recent meta-analysis found
that, on average, moderate-intensity
physical activity can reduce HbA1c
by
0.6% among individuals with type 2 dia-
betes (39). According to data from the
U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study, this is a
level sufficient to reduce the risk of micro-
vascular complications by 22% (40). Life-
style modification involving nutrition and
physical activity also has the potential to
improve cardiovascular risk factors such
as blood pressure and lipid levels (39,41).
Because physical activity and suboptimal
dietary behaviors are associated (42), tar-
geting both exercise and diet may be
needed for the optimal treatment of indi-
viduals with type 2 diabetes.
A recent systematic review of diabetes
self-management studies suggests that tai-

Diet and exercise in type 2 diabetes
1726 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 25, NUMBER 10, OCTOBER 2002
lored interventions actively involving pa-
tient participation can change lifestyle
behaviors, including diet and exercise
(43). Increasing physical activity levels
can be achieved by a variety of means,
including public health programs and
community-based interventions (14). Pri-
mary care­based physical activity coun-
seling is also moderately effective (44),
although few studies have been specifi-
cally designed for individuals with type 2
diabetes. The current challenge is trans-
lating research findings into routine clin-
ical practice and public health efforts to
improve health outcomes for all individ-
uals with type 2 diabetes (45).
Acknowledgments-- We would like to
thank Gail Harrison, PhD, for her assistance in
analyzing the nutrition variables in NHANES
III.
This paper was presented at the American
Diabetes Association meeting in San Fran-
cisco, California, on June 17, 2002.
