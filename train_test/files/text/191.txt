Few investigations of the social correlates of depressive symptomatology have addressed variation in the correlates
across multiple dimensions of depression scales. We examined the relationships of selected social, clinical, and demo-
graphic correlates with four dimensions of the Centerfor Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D) scale in 3,401
community-dwelling elders in the Piedmont area of North Carolina. These correlates explained significant variation in
somatic complaints and depressed affect; effects of chronic disability and recent negative events were particularly ro-
bust. Having a confidant explained reduced symptomatologyfor allfour dimensions, but particularlyfor low positive af-
fect and interpersonalproblems. Positive affect was also buttressed by helping others. These patterns have particular rel-
evance where treatmentfor depression is divorcedfrom considerations of the social environment of the elderly patient.
MOST studies of the social correlates of depressive
symptoms do not take into consideration the multidi-
mensionality of depressive symptom scales. This study uses
George's (1996) multistage conceptual model of the social
precursors of mood impairment to examine the differential re-
lationships between social factors and four dimensions of de-
pressive symptomatology and to suggest implications of
those differences for research and clinical practice.
Factor analyses of a number of depression rating scales
have repeatedly demonstrated the multidimensionality of
mood states. Radloff (1977) reported a four-factor structure
for the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-
D) Scale. The four factors included depressed affect (dyspho-
ria), low positive affect (lack of well-being), somatic com-
plaints (retarded activity or enervation), and interpersonal
problems. This first-order structure has been generally con-
firmed by subsequent analyses (e.g., Davidson, Feldman, &
Crawford, 1994; Hertzog, Van Alstine, Usala, Hultsch, &
Dixon, 1990). Factorial analyses of other self-report depres-
sion measures such as the Beck Depression Inventory (Start-
up, Rees, & Barkham, 1992), Zung Self-rating Depression
Scale (Kivela & Pahkala, 1987), and the Geriatric Depression
Scale (Sheikh et al., 1991), indicate that they also tap several
dimensions of depression. The numbers and character of fac-
tors vary with (1) the nature and wording of the items in-
cluded in each measurement instrument (Zich, Attkisson, &
Greenfield, 1990), (2) the relative emphasis of the instrument
on symptom frequency or severity (Giambra, 1977), (3) the
characteristics of the sample population (Startup et al., 1992),
and (4) the method of analysis (McCallum, Mackinnon,
Simons, & Simons, 1995). However, the literature evaluating
psychometric measures of depression provides considerable
evidence that the entity being measured is to some extent mul-
tidimensional. We review that literature below, using the ter-
minology of "depression" and "mood" to refer to the overall
construct being measured.
As Gibbons, Clark, & Kupfer (1993) have pointed out, rel-
atively few investigations of the risk of mood impairment
have addressed the dimensionality of depression scales.
Therefore, inconsistencies in the extensive literature reporting
relationships between antecedent demographic, clinical, or
social correlates and depression may be partly an artifact of
the traditional reliance on unidimensional summary measures
of depressive symptoms. If precursor variables differentially
influence the development of different dimensions of depres-
sive symptomatology, then analyses based on the assumption
that depression is unidimensional may obscure differences in
the magnitude or even the direction of the relationships be-
tween those correlates and impaired mood.
Some evidence for the differential influence of precursor
variables on dimensions of depression is available, particu-
larly from studies involving depression measurement scales
including items pertaining to both negative (depressed) and
positive affect, which show that the two factors are separate
and partially independent dimensions with potentially differ-
ent precursors (Clark & Watson, 1991, Lawton et al., 1991).
Negative affect is more reactive to health and internal at-
tributes, and positive affect more responsive to external
events (Clark & Watson, 1991). Zich et al. (1990) have sug-
gested that the positive subscale measures a clinically mean-
ingful dimension of depression, which may be associated
with depletion of social support networks or loss of positive
experiences, particularly in elders. In this context, research
focusing on the social correlates of multiple dimensions of
depression may provide information enabling clinicians to
improve the accuracy with which they target treatment
modalities to elderly populations.
This cross-sectional study provides a systematic analysis of
P31
P32 HAYSETAL
the relationships of selected social, clinical, and demographic
correlates with four dimensions of depression (as defined by
the traditional four factors of the CES-D scale) in a large com-
munity-dwelling sample of elders in the Piedmont area of
North Carolina. These correlates are evaluated in a framework
based on George's (1996) multistage conceptual model of the
social precursors of mood impairment. George's schema pre-
sents the development of psychiatric symptomatology as a
multi-step chronological process. Variables classed as demo-
graphic (e.g. age, gender, race) exert their influence at an early
stage of this process, followed by life-achievement variables
such as education and income. Variables expected to increase
vulnerability to depression (chronic stressors such as disability
or chronic medical conditions), and factors considered protec-
tive against the development of depressive symptoms (particu-
larly social support), express their effects at a later stage in the
process. The influence of any provoking agents, such as nega-
tive life events, is expressed even later in the process, just be-
fore the development of symptomatology.
Hypotheses
Our research hypotheses were based on the literature inves-
tigating the influence of vulnerability factors, protective fac-
tors, and provoking agents on depression in older adults.
Because most of this research treats depression as a unitary
construct, particular emphasis was given to studies systemati-
cally examining relationships between psychosocial correlates
and multiple dimensions of depression. These include Krause
(1987) and Blazer, Hughes, & George (1992), who reported
results for three and two dimensions of the CES-D, respec-
tively, and also Mitchell, Mathews, & Yesavage (1993), who
used as dependent variables three dimensions derived from the
factorial structure of the shortened Geriatric Depression Scale
(GDS). Two of the GDS-based dimensions are roughly equiva-
lent to the depressed affect and reduced positive affect compo-
nents of the CES-D. Comparability of results among these
studies is reduced not only by incomplete overlap among the
dimensions of depression chosen for study, but also by the fact
that each research group operationalized social support as a
multidimensional construct using a different set of instru-
ments. Nevertheless, taken collectively, their findings demon-
strate that psychosocial variables are not related monolithically
to dimensions of depression.
For independent variables classed as vulnerability factors,
protective factors, or provoking agents, we developed hy-
potheses concerning 1) the equivalence of effect (in magni-
tude and direction) across all four CES-D subscales, and 2)
specificity of effect of selected independent variables on each
dimension of depressive symptomatology.
Vulnerability factors hypotheses. -- Functional disability
and chronic medical conditions have both been shown to
predict depression in elderly populations (Jorm, 1995).
Functional disability in particular is robustly related to in-
creased symptomatology in elders (La Gory & Fitzpatrick,
1992); its effects have been demonstrated across all dimen-
sions of both the CES-D (Berkman et al., 1986) and the GDS
(Mitchell et al., 1993). Cognitive impairment was linked to
increased symptomatology for both dimensions of depression
tested by Blazer et al. (1992). Other chronic stressors (e.g.
chronic financial strain) also exert similar effects across all
tested dimensions of depression (Krause, 1987). Accordingly,
we hypothesized that each of the three correlates classed as
vulnerability factors (functional disability, cognitive impair-
ment, chronic medical conditions) would significantly and
consistently increase symptomatology across all four CES-D
subscales (depressed affect, somatic complaints, low positive
affect, interpersonal problems).
Protectivefactors hypotheses. -- Social support, the proto-
typical protective factor against late-life depression, is gener-
ally acknowledged as multidimensional, with some dimen-
sions clearly protective and others apparently ineffective
(George, 1996; Krause, 1987). Furthermore, protective effects
of each individual dimension of social support may vary
across depression subscales within both the CES-D (Blazer et
al., 1992; Krause, 1987) and the GDS (Mitchell et al., 1993).
Combining the reports of Krause (1987), Blazer et al.
(1992), and Mitchell et al. (1993) in the context of George's
(1996) review, we hypothesized that 1) variables classed as
protective factors (satisfaction with social support, confidant
availability, amount of social interaction, receiving instrumen-
tal support, giving instrumental support) would exert differen-
tial effects across the four CES-D subscales, with one excep-
tion (social network size) which would not influence any
dimension of depressive symptomatology; 2a) satisfaction
with social support was expected to protect against reduction
of positive affect (as per Blazer et al., 1992; Krause, 1987)
and somatic complaints (as per Blazer et al., 1992); availabil-
ity of a confidant, (another measure of perceived social sup-
port) was expected to follow the same pattern; 2b) social in-
teraction and giving and receiving instrumental support were
expected to protect only against low positive affect.
Provoking agents hypothesis. -- Provoking agents include
a variety of negative stressful life events (e.g., bereave-
ment, other personal losses, acute family crises) associated
with late-life depressive symptomatology (George, 1996;
Stephenson-Cino et al., 1992). Aggregate totals of negative
life events are typically higher for persons suffering depres-
sion than for general population controls (Paykel, 1994). We
predicted that the number of negative life events experienced
by subjects in the previous year would demonstrate similar
associations, significantly increasing symptomatology on four
CES-D subscales.
Other correlates. -- We did not test specific hypotheses
concerning the roles of demographic or life-achievement vari-
ables in the development of each dimension of depression.
However, our analyses were adjusted for demographic factors
(age, gender, and race), as well as two life achievement fac-
tors (education and income) which have been linked by previ-
ous research (Berkman et al., 1986; Mitchell et al., 1993) to
depressive symptomatology.
METHODS
Design and Sample
This research used cross-sectional baseline data (1986-7)
from the Duke University site of the Established Populations
CORRELATES OF DEPRESSIONDIMENSIONS P33
for the Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly (EPESE).
Details of EPESE, a multi-site collaborative program funded
by the National Institute on Aging, are described elsewhere
(Cornoni-Huntley et al., 1986). The Duke EPESE, a random-
ized household sample of elders (n = 4,162) from five coun-
ties in the north-central (Piedmont) area of North Carolina, in-
cluded an over-sample of African-American respondents
(55% compared to 45% primarily White elders). Sample
weights were developed to adjust sample distributions for
probability of selection within households of various sizes
and for differential non-response and to match the demo-
graphic characteristics of the five-county area reported by the
US Bureau of the Census. Use of sample weights in the statis-
tical procedures redistributed responses to the racial distribu-
tion of the population: 36% African-American and 64% non-
African-American (Cornoni-Huntley et al., 1990). We excluded
baseline interviews provided by proxy informants (n = 162)
and interviews with missing data on one or more of the CES-
D depression items (n = 599), leaving an effective sample of
3401. Compared to others, the 599 respondents (15%) ex-
cluded due to missing data on depression were, on average,
slightly older (by 1.5 years), less educated (by 1 year), and
more likely (23% vs. 11%) to report 'poor' subjective health.
They also had lower average annual incomes (by $1,400). No
race or gender differences were observed.
While 15% of the sample had missing data on at least one
(of four) dimensions of depression, each separate dimension
had 5% or fewer missing cases. To test hypotheses about dif-
ferences in the effects of independent variables across dimen-
sions, it was necessary to eliminate those (15%) with missing
data on any of the four dimensions. In supplemental analyses,
we reran our regression models on the four dimensions sepa-
rately with 5% or fewer cases excluded for each separate
model. The variance explained by each model, and the signifi-
cance, direction, and magnitude of the individual coefficients
were virtually identical to the results reported below (where
15% are excluded and differences in the effects of coefficients
across dimensions are tested). These supplemental results in-
dicate that excluding 15% did not seriously bias our results.
Measures
Dependent variables. -- The dependent variables were
scores from each of the four CES-D subscales: depressed af-
fect, low positive affect, somatic complaints, and interper-
sonal problems (Table 1). The CES-D had been modified to
permit binary responses to each item, with response options
collapsed to a yes/no format for reporting the presence or ab-
sence of a symptom during the week preceding the interview
(Blazer, Burchett, Service, & George, 1991). Each dependent
variable was the sum of the number of symptoms reported by
a respondent for its respective subscale. Higher values on all
subscales indicate a greater degree of depressive symptoma-
tology. Higher values on the "low positive affect" subscale
therefore represent reductions in positive affect.
Independent variables. -- Our analysis included three de-
mographic variables (age, race, gender) and two life achieve-
ment factors (years of formal education, household income).
Three potential vulnerability factors were examined. A com-
posite measure of functional disability summed impairments
assessed by the Katz activities of daily living (ADL) scale,
the Rosow-Breslau functional health status scale, and the
Nagi physical activity scale (Cornoni-Huntley et al., 1990).
Test-retest reliability has been shown to be high for individual
Katz (95-98%) and Rosow-Breslau (85-89%) items, and
more variable for Nagi (57-79%) items, and all three sum-
mary scores have shown strong test-retest agreement (Smith
et al., 1990). Reliability and validity of both the original Katz
scale and its subsequent modifications are widely accepted
(Kane & Kane, 1981; Ernst & Ernst, 1984; Branch & Meyers,
1987, McDowell & Newell 1996), and a reproducibility coef-
ficient of 0.91 has been reported for the Rosow-Breslau scale
(Kane & Kane, 1981). Cognitive impairment was measured
with Pfeiffer's (1975) Short Portable Mental Status Question-
naire (alpha = 0.83 [McDowell and Newell, 1996]). Physical
health was assessed using a summary measure of the presence
and severity of the following chronic illnesses: heart prob-
lems, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, cancer (Galanos, Fillen-
baum, Cohen, & Burchett, 1994; Landerman, 1996).
Independent social support variables included two mea-
sures of perceived social support (availability of at least one
trusted confidant and satisfaction with the amount of social
interaction), scaled from responses to two and three items, re-
spectively. The alpha coefficients for these two scales were
0.55 and 0.43, respectively. The low reliability reflects the
small number of constituent items as much as a lack of asso-
ciation. Social interaction frequency was scaled from 5 items
(numbers of friends and relatives seen or telephoned in the

past month and memberships in clubs or organizations).
Instrumental support given to and received from family/
friends was scaled from 13 and 12 items, respectively. Items
included such domains as providing meals or transportation,
loaning money, and giving advice or gifts. Social network size
was scaled by summing responses to 7 items concerning
numbers of friends/relatives in the respondent's social net-
work. (Landerman, 1996). Alphas were not calculated for
these scales because the constituent items are considered
cause, rather than effect, indicators (Bollen, 1989), i.e., they
would not be expected to be correlated. Social interaction fre-
quency, which was correlated with the other social support
variables and unrelated to any dependent variables, was
dropped from further analysis to reduce collinearity.
Provoking agents were represented by a single variable
summing the number of life events from 19 categories (e.g.,
changes in family structure, including deaths and divorce, and
changes in residence, health, or financial status) occurring
during the year prior to the interview and evaluated by the re-
spondent as having a negative effect (Landerman, George,
Campbell & Blazer, 1989).
Preliminary regressions using a quadratic as well as a linear
term for income indicated a nonlinear relationship with de-
pression which could be adequately modeled with a single in-
come dummy coded 1 for respondents with <$6,000 in yearly
income. For other continuous independent variables, tests of
nonlinearity were negative. Ranges, means, and standard de-
viations for all variables are presented in Table 2.
Analytic Plan
To deal with skewed outcomes (counts of CES-D symp-
toms), the data were analyzed using PROC CALIS (SAS,
1990) to perform weighted least squares using Browne's
(1984) arbitrary distribution function (ADF). As discussed in
Bollen (1989), the ADF estimator performs well with skewed
dependent variables. CALIS can also determine whether the
effects of an independent variable vary across correlated out-
comes, and thus can test whether the regression effects of
stress and social support differ significantly across the differ-
ent dimensions of depression. Such advantages outweigh the
principal drawback of this strategy (i.e., it is not possible to
estimate design effects with this version of LISREL). We con-
sistently use a 0.01 level of significance to compensate for
possible underestimation of standard errors associated with
omission of design effects.
An initial saturated model was estimated with effects of the
postulated vulnerability and protective factors, provoking
agents, and other independent variables allowed to vary
across the four (correlated) dimensions of depression. For
each regressor, an additional model was then estimated in
which the unstandardized effects were constrained to be equal
across outcomes. The difference in fit between the uncon-
strained and the constrained models (based on the logs of
their likelihood functions) is distributed as x2, and provided a
significance test of whether the hypothesis of equal effects
across dependent variables was consistent with the data. To
eliminate potential confounding due to differences in scale,
we rescaled the dependent variables such that each depression
subscale ranged from zero (no symptoms) to five (maximum
possible number of symptoms reported). This was done by
weighting the (low) positive affect scale by 5/3, the somatic
complaints scale by 5/6, and the interpersonal problems scale
by 5/2. To test for possible distortion due to rescaling, the
analyses were repeated using the unsealed outcomes and
using logistic regression with each outcome dichotomized at
zero versus one or more symptoms. The results were compa-
rable to those reported below.
Mean imputations were used for independent variables with
less than 2% missing data. For items with 2-5% missing data,
we imputed a regression-predicted score based on the other in-
dependent variables in the regression model. For income, so-
cial interaction, and negative life events, which had >5% miss-
ing data, we used stochastic regression imputation. This
procedure (imputation of an error term along with a regres-
sion-predicted score) is designed to estimate accurately both
the variance and mean of the imputed variable, and therefore
minimize bias in relevant tests of significance (David, Little,
Samihel, & Triest, 1986). Significance tests were based on the
number of missing cases prior to imputation.
We ran separate regressions of all independent variables
and covariates entered simultaneously on each of the four di-
mensions of depression. We report both unstandardized met-
ric coefficients, which permit comparison of the effects of the
same regressor across outcomes, and standardized beta coeffi-
cients, which are used to compare the effects of different re-
gressors on the same outcome.
While causal direction cannot be assumed when cross-sec-
tional data only are employed, we were guided in our interpre-
tation of these analyses by the following principles: (1) Traits
such as the demographic variables gender and race, and other
fixed characteristics such as educational achievement, are as-
sumed to pre-date symptoms of depression; (2) State phe-

nomena, (including all variables categorized as vulnerability
factors, protective factors, and provoking agents) are assumed
to antedate the present report of depressive symptoms, al-
though prior depressive symptoms may have had a causal (an-
tecedent) effect on those state variables. We base the latter
principle on differences in temporal wording between depen-
dent (CES-D) and independent variables in the EPESE ques-
tionnaires. The stem of the CES-D scale items specifies ". . .
during the past week." In contrast, items measuring the inde-
pendent variables either require respondents to assess aspects
of their social environment which were established prior to the
past week (e.g., annual family income, level of education,
availability of a trusted confidant), or explicitly indicate a time
frame preceding and including the past week (e.g., amount of
help given or received "in the past year," negative life events
occurring "in the past year," and medical conditions "ever" di-
agnosed.) Therefore, where the significance of albeit cross-
sectional associations warrant, we will consider depressive
symptoms to be reactive to psychosocial correlates, while ex-
plicitly noting the distinct possibility that the social environ-
ment was itself reactive to similar mood states prior to our first
contact with these subjects.
RESULTS
Relationships among subscales. -- Table 3 shows fre-
quency distributions of, and correlations among, the four CES-
D subscales. Most respondents were asymptomatic on the
scales measuring interpersonal problems and low personal af-
fect. Almost 40% of the sample reported at least one symptom
of depressed affect, and over half reported at least one somatic
complaint. Depressed affect and somatic complaints subscales
shared over 1/3 of their variance with other subscales; shared
variance was lower (about 1/8) for the other two subscales.
Tests of equivalence. -- Table 4 summarizes x2 tests for the
null hypothesis of equivalent effects across all four dimen-
sions of depressive symptoms. Equivalent (non-significant)
outcomes were observed for two vulnerability factors (cogni-
tive impairment and chronic health problems). Equivalent ef-
fects were also seen for two protective factors hypothesized to
show differential effects. Availability of a confidant proved
strongly protective for all dimensions. Social interaction was
not related to any dimension (and was therefore omitted from
the models reported in Table 4). Hypotheses of equivalent
outcomes across all dimensions for one protective factor (so-
cial network size) and for the provoking agent variable (nega-
tive life events) were not supported.
Tests of specificity. -- Overall, the full set of independent
variables was more strongly associated with somatic com-
plaints and depressed affect than with the other two dimen-
sions of depression, as indicated by the R2 values at the bot-
tom of each column in the table. The unstandardized
regression coefficients demonstrate specific differences in the
effects of regressors across dependent variables. The general
pattern of stronger effects for depression and somatic symp-
toms and weaker effects for positive affect is most pro-
nounced for differences in the effects of functional disability
and negative events across subscales.
In supplemental analyses, we re-estimated the models for
each subscale using Poisson regression. Poisson is especially
useful when the dependent variable is a highly skewed count
and ordinary least squares assumptions are not met (Cameron
& Trivedi, 1986). In general, the Rvs and patterns of signifi-
cance with Poisson were consistent with our overall findings
and conclusions. For each subscale, we calculated a 'pseudo
Rv (Land, McCall, & Nagin, 1996) based on the Poisson re-
sults. Their values (.16, .07, .22, and .07 respectively for de-
pressed affect, positive affect, somatic complaints and inter-
personal problems) were almost identical to those reported in
Table 4. Three coefficients which were trends (.05 <p < .10)
in Table 4 were significant in Poisson (interpersonal problems
with cognitive impairment and satisfaction with social sup-

were the same across estimation techniques. Because no soft-
ware is available for structural equation modeling (LISREL)
with Poisson regression, we were unable to replicate our tests
of whether the effects of regressors were different across sub-
scales. (This is the reaso'h we use PROC CALIS with the
ADF estimator).
Our hypothesis that each vulnerability factor would be pos-
itively related to symptomatology held for only one of three
variables. Functional disability was strongly related to both
somatic complaints and depressed affect, and significantly re-
lated to lowered positive affect, but not related to interper-
sonal problems.
One of the two perceived social support measures (satisfac-
tion with amount of social interaction) protected against so-
matic complaints and depressed affect. The other (availability
of a confidant) was highly protective against all four dimen-
sions of depression. Neither conformed to the pattern of ef-
fects which had been expected (protection against somatic
complaints and positive affect only). Size of social network,
which had not been expected to exert protective effects
against any dimension of depression, was positively associ-
ated with both depressed affect and interpersonal problems.
Giving instrumental help protected against lowered positive
affect (as hypothesized), but was also linked to increased in-
terpersonal problems. Receiving instrumental help was not
protective against low positive affect (as hypothesized), but
instead was associated with depressed affect and somatic
complaints.
Negative life events acted as provoking agents for all four
dimensions of depression (as hypothesized). Their effects
were more strongly expressed on the subscales measuring de-
pressed affect and somatic complaints than on the other sub-
scales.
In the regression for each CES-D subscale, the magnitude
of the standardized beta coefficient associated with each cor-
relate indicates its relative importance as an independent vari-
able for that dimension of depression. These coefficients indi-
cate that the vulnerability factor of functional disability and
the single variable representing provoking agents (negative
life events) were the two most powerful regressors both for
somatic complaints and (in reversed order) for depressed af-

feet. In contrast, non-availability of a confidant and giving lit-
tle instrumental support were the most important regressors
for low positive affect. Confidant non-availability was also the
most important correlate of interpersonal problems; next in
importance were negative life events and, unexpectedly, giv-
ing much instrumental support.
DISCUSSION
General patterns. -- Traditionally, depression has been
treated as a unitary construct in the epidemiologic literature.
Our results underscore the limitations of such a strategy.
Correlations among the different depression subscales (Table
3) were too low to be consistent with the presence of a single
underlying dimension; only that between depressed affect and
somatic complaints exceeded 0.35. This pair of dimensions
characteristically shows the highest correlation among CES-D
subscales in samples of elders (e.g., Berkman et al., 1986;
Davidson et al., 1994; Zich et al., 1990).
Explained variance for the full set of correlates for our
sample of elders was considerably greater for somatic com-
plaints and depressed affect than for the other two dimensions
of depression. This pattern is somewhat similar to that seen in
the additive model of Krause (1987), where R2 values were
similar for depressed affect and somatic subscales, and con-
siderably lower for the positive affect subscale (Table 2).
Before continuing, it is important to point out that our re-
sults apply to the four dimensions of depression only as mea-
sured by the CES-D. Our focus is on the utility of disaggre-
gating the CES-D scale into its separate dimensions in
epidemiological analyses. The findings indicate that the mea-
sures of positive affect and interpersonal problems, which
have low variance and high skew, are less responsive to social
factors than depressive symptoms and somatic complaints.
Replications using Poisson regression provide evidence that
these skewed distributions did not seriously distort the find-
ings for the measures employed. However, we cannot rule out
the possibility that different results would be obtained using
measures of positive affect and interpersonal problems with
high prevalence and less skew.
Depressed affect and somatic complaints. -- Depressed af-
fect and somatic complaints showed similar patterns of rela-
tionship with respect to multiple variables. Both functional
disability and negative life events were more strongly related
to depressed affect and somatic complaints than of low posi-
tive affect and interpersonal problems. Our findings contrast
with other studies reporting more consistent effects of func-
tional disability across dimensions. Berkman et al. (1986) re-
ported significantly increased symptomatology for every one
of the 20 CES-D items in elders with one or more functional
disabilities. Similarly, Mitchell et al. (1993) reported that im-
pairment in instrumental activities of daily living was associ-
ated with increased symptoms across all dimensions of de-
pression on the GDS.
Similarities between depressed affect and somatic com-
plaints were also seen with respect to protective factors.
Satisfaction with the amount of social interaction was protec-
tive for only these two dimensions of depression. Further-
more, only the depressed affect and somatic complaints sub-
scales were significantly associated with instrumental support
received. However, the direction of this association was unex-
pected: receiving support was linked to exacerbation rather
than reduction of symptoms. This counterintuitive finding is
consistent with the linkage between receipt of instrumental
social support and worsened depressive affect reported by
Mitchell et al. (1993), but contrary to Krause's (1987) report
that receipt of tangible support showed no association with
these two CES-D subscales. Our results may indicate that re-
ceiving support is a consequence rather than a cause of de-
pressive symptoms in these cross-sectional analyses.
Low positive affect. -- The level of correlation between
subscales measuring low positive affect and depressed affect
(0.32) is consistent with the characterization of these dimen-
sions as relatively but not totally independent in much of the
literature on affect balance and well-being (Clark & Watson,
1991). The strongest correlates of changes in positive affect
were two protective factors: availability of a confidant and
giving instrumental support. Our findings are consistent with
the report of Chappell & Badger (1989) that lack of a confi-
dant is associated with reduced well-being. They also agree
with Krause's (1987) report that elders providing assistance to
others showed less symptomatology on the low positive affect
dimension of the CES-D. Perhaps positive affect in elders
who give aid is partially maintained by comparison of their
own situation with the lives of persons to whom they provide
assistance.
A national survey including separate measures for provi-
sion of informal and formal support provides evidence for a
mechanism linking support giving and reduction of symp-
tomatology in other dimensions of depression, but it involves
indirect rather than direct effects (Krause, Herzog, & Baker,
1992). Their model indicates that provision of informal sup-
port is directly linked to increased perception of personal con-
trol, which in turn is associated with reduction of depressed
affect and somatic complaints. Krause et al. (1992) also sug-
gested that giving support to others bolsters feelings of self-
esteem. Our data did not include measures of personal control
or self-esteem.
Our finding that negative life events are associated with a
reduction in positive affect contrasts with the report by Vaux
& Meddin (1987) that negative life changes had no effect on
two measures of positive affect in a sample of 144 Mid-
western, rural elders. However, we found that negative life
events had a more powerful influence on depressed affect than
on low positive affect. This finding is more consistent with the
model of Zautra & Reich (1983), which proposes that nega-
tive events exert their influence primarily on negative affective
states, and positive affective states are influenced primarily by
positive rather than negative events. Data on positive life
events were not available in our study.
Interpersonal problems. -- Interpersonal problems (feeling
disliked and perceiving people as unfriendly) were correlated
in our sample with the lack of a confidant and an impaired so-
cial network. Unexpectedly, we also.found that giving instru-
mental aid was linked to increased symptoms on the CES-D
interpersonal problems subscale. The direction of this rela-
tionship is opposite to that seen for low positive affect. To the
P38 HAYSETAL
extent that caregivers are more isolated and absorbed in care-
giving tasks, they may be avoided or dismissed by friends and
acquaintances, contributing to a discounting of the friendship
and care of others.
Factors which affected allfour dimensions. -- Two vulner-
ability factors showed consistent lack of effect across all di-
mensions. Lack of association between cognitive impairment
and these two CES-D subscales is not in agreement with other
published studies. Blazer et al. (1992) reported that cognitive
impairment predicted increased symptomatology for both low
positive affect and somatic complaints. La Rue, Swan, &
Carmelli (1995) reported that only lower positive affect was
significantly linked to impairment on the MMSE. However,
the subjects included in these two studies were clinically or
demographically dissimilar from the EPESE: Blazer et al.
(1992) included both middle-aged and elderly adults in their
clinical study; while the community sample of elders by La
Rue et al. (1995) was restricted to men.
Lack of association between our measure of chronic medi-
cal conditions and any dimension of depression may have
been a function of including functional disability in our mod-
els. Functional disability mediates much of the effect of
health on depression, and also serves as an indicator of the
severity of these conditions. To confirm this speculation, we
ran the models without the disability variable, resulting in sig-
nificant relationships between chronic conditions and both de-
pressed affect and somatic complaints, and a trend for their
relationship to interpersonal problems. Foelker & Shewchuk
(1992) reported a positive correlation of total symptom count
on the Physical Health Domain Index with somatic com-
plaints, but not with any other dimension of depression.
The single protective factor which consistently influenced
all four dimensions of depression was confidant availability
(which had not been expected to show protective effects on all
subscales). The importance of this dimension of social sup-
port is well-documented in the literature (George 1996), but
the findings of this study provide new evidence concerning
both the breadth and specificity of its protective effect against
depressive symptoms.
Despite the fact that negative life events were represented
by an aggregate variable in this analysis, we found that per-
sons who had experienced a large number of such events in
the preceding twelve months showed higher symptomatology
across all dimensions of depression. In contrast, Krause
(1986) reported that summed measures of negative life events
consistently failed to predict risk on any CES-D subscale. He
recommended disaggregation of negative life events due to
the extent of variation among categories of stressful life
events with respect to the strength of their relationship with
symptoms on each CES-D subscale at different levels of so-
cial support. Bereavement, for example, was significantly
linked to somatic symptoms when social support was limited
(Krause, 1986). In supplementary analyses (not shown), we
re-estimated our regression models using separate measures
for bereavement and non-bereavement events. The effects of
bereavement and non-bereavement events (across outcomes)
were essentially the same in our analysis. Further investiga-
tion of additive and interactive effects of disaggregated mea-
sures of both negative life events and social support on the
four dimensions of depression, following the example of
Krause (1986), might provide additional insight concerning
risk in subgroups of elderly persons.
Relevant theoretical work (Bowlby, 1988; Sroufe & Rutter,
1984) indicates that the relationship between the social envi-
ronment and depression is characterized not by a few power-
ful risk factors, but by a multiplicity of events and experiences
which can exert modest effects. Disaggregating the CES-D
provides evidence that there are differences in effects across
dimensions. These differences can be obscured, and modest
effects which vary in strength across dimensions can be
missed altogether, if the scale is not disaggregated. Given this,
and given that many of the effects expected are modest to
begin with, disaggregation is especially useful in epidemio-
logic attempts to map out the complex relationship between
the social environment and the risk of depression. Future re-
search should also address whether these relationships are dif-
ferential by subgroups of the elderly, e.g., by gender.
In clinical practice, depressed affect and somatic com-
plaints may most likely be reported concurrently with chronic
disability or recent negative events. Positive affect may most
effectively be buttressed for elders who help others and have a
confidant. Clinicians who first attempt to optimize treatment
of medical conditions (reduce chronic disability) and provide
timely crisis counseling to those with acute life stress will de-
crease the risk of multiple dimensions of depression. Beyond
these strategies, persons who present with certain symptom
profiles may have selective deficits in their social support sys-
tems, including particular difficulties mobilizing support. This
is a new finding and one with particular relevance where treat-
ment for depressed mood is divorced from considerations of
the social environment of the elderly patient.
