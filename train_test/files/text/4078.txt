Introduction
The complexity of conservative foreign policy needs careful
examination. As a consequence of the Cold War, American
conservatives developed the reputation for being hawkish,
yet military adventurism is not, nor ever has been, a prereq-
uisite conservative value in America. Therefore, this essay
will explore the different approaches to foreign policy seen
within the conservative big tent and examine the likely future
of the hawks. Although intellectuals behind the different
schools of thought will be discussed, the focus will be on the
attitudes of politicians and grassroots conservatives. Some of
these intellectuals, particularly the realists, do not necessar-
ily identify as "conservative," but they must be discussed as
they have influenced conservative foreign policy.
Since the time of Reagan, American conservatives have
been successful when they have been able to build a "big
tent." This essay need not rehash the already well-researched
history of the making of this "conservative big tent" but will
focus on the present state of it as it pertains to foreign policy.
The "conservative big tent" referred to in this essay, there-
fore, is the coalition of various foreign policy preferences
that have been welcome in the conservative movement from
the time of Reagan to the present. The conservative, in any
context and any culture, seeks to conserve a set of values and
a way of life. For the conservative interventionist, war is not
fought simply for the sake of war. Rather, if there is a per-
ceived threat to conservative values that require military
intervention, the conservative will support it out of necessity.
It is important, therefore, to understand the debate over this
necessity within the conservative movement, to better under-
stand conservative foreign policy in America.
The neoconservatives, the most hawkish in the conserva-
tive big tent, have come to dominate conservative foreign
policy over the last decade, despite the Cold War being long
over. Some in the conservative big tent argue that neoconser-
vatives are not genuine conservatives. Although this essay
will not seek to answer that question, this debate will be con-
sidered for the purpose of understanding these internal dis-
putes within the conservative movement. Either way,
neoconservatives have been a crucial to the conservative
movement at least since the Vietnam era, particularly on for-
eign policy. Although neoconservatives have been incredibly
resilient and defied many predictions of their decline, their
future prospects within the "conservative big tent" seem

The Decline of Military Adventurism
in the Conservative Big Tent: Why
Grassroots Conservatives in the United
States Are Embracing a More Cautious
Foreign Policy
Richard Wagner1
Abstract
It is now clear that the American conservative movement can no longer be easily categorized as "hawkish" on foreign policy.
This essay examines the different perspectives, ranging from intellectuals and experts to grassroots conservatives and popular
political culture, to grasp the widening range of foreign policy preferences that currently make up the conservative movement
(or conservative big tent). Second, this essay considers the challenges that these hawks, mainly the neoconservatives, are
likely to face due to the realities of generational politics. This essay will therefore provide a useful analysis of the different
foreign policy preferences in the American conservative movement in the 21st century.

grim at the moment. Like most social movements in the
United States, the grassroots supporters of the conservative
movement are absolutely crucial to its direction, and there-
fore the foreign policy preferences of grassroots conserva-
tives will be carefully examined in this essay, particularly
toward neoconservative foreign policy. Given decades of
neoconservative peaks and troughs, it would be irresponsible
to predict certain doom for the neoconservatives as some lib-
ertarians have. However, neoconservatives are at least in a
trough since the wind down of the occupation of Iraq, and
they do not seem to be able to resonate with grassroots con-
servatives as effectively as they did a decade ago, though the
recent ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) threat could
cause grassroots conservatives to remain hawkish.
The Spectrum of Doves and Hawks in
the "Conservative Big Tent"
To argue simply that conservatives are either "doves" or
"hawks" would create a false dichotomy. It is more accurate
to break conservatives into roughly four categories: non-
interventionists, cautious realists, hawkish realists, and neo-
conservatives. The two opposite ends of the spectrum are
idealists in that they approach foreign policy with more nor-
mative values, whereas the two realist approaches mainly
disagree over some of the consequences of power politics.
This spectrum varies with other ideologies and political
movements, but the conservative big tent can be effectively
categorized into these four groups. Nearly all self-identified
conservatives in America fit somewhere into this spectrum.
Since the Reagan era, they have become mostly locked in the
Republican Party and all in their own way value American
interests first. They all value American sovereignty and have
little to no interest in the United States being a mutual partner
in a larger "global community." Most grassroots conserva-
tives are probably not familiar even with the four terms men-
tioned above, much less the intellectuals behind them.
However, grassroots conservatives and Republican politi-
cians alike hold such persuasions.
The non-interventionist (often of a libertarian-conserva-
tive persuasion) usually contends that enemies of the United
States are so because they have been provoked. They con-
tend that Al-Qaeda, for example, attacked on September 11,
2001, in response to the strong U.S. military presence in the
Middle East. As Ron Paul so famously said in a 2008
Presidential Debate, "They don't come here to attack us
because we're rich and we're free. They attack us because
we're over there" (Ron Paul, 2007, Republican Presidential
Debate). These non-interventionists were largely exiled from
the conservative big tent during much of the Bush adminis-
tration, but they have been slowly welcomed back due in part
to the Republican electoral defeats of 2006 and 2008. The
Tea Party, which has re-mobilized grassroots conservatives,
emerged initially as a Ron Paul movement in 2007 but
became a major force early into Obama's presidency with the
backing of conservative opinion leaders and funds.
Regardless of what happens to the Tea Party itself, these
Paulite-libertarians have grown substantially over the last 5
years, particularly with younger conservatives.
The cautious realists are often on the same side of foreign
policy with the non-interventionists, but for very different
reasons. Realists will commonly reject the non-intervention-
ist view that other people and other nations will only be a
danger to us if we harm them. This would completely ignore
the balance of power that is at the core of realist foreign pol-
icy. However, a cautious realist will usually avoid direct
military intervention, believing that military adventurism is
imprudent. Cautious realists certainly support a strong
national defense, believing that enemies need not be pro-
voked to wish us harm, but that they will not cause us harm
if it is not in their best interest. Unlike the strict non-interven-
tionists, the cautious realists recognize the balance of power
in international politics. Nuclear proliferation is certainly
compatible with this philosophy, as no two nuclear powers
have ever gone to war with each other directly. There have
been many proxy wars, such as the infamous Vietnam War,
but never a direct war between two nuclear powers. Cautious
realists also are more likely than non-interventionists to sup-
port military intervention to aid an ally, or to contain a rival
great power. Presidents Reagan and Bush Sr. relied on this
approach to foreign policy to contain and ultimately defeat
the Soviet Union, and to liberate Kuwait and weaken
Hussein's Iraq. Due to Reagan's popular status in the mem-
ory of nearly all American conservatives, there has been sig-
nificant debate over Reagan's foreign policy legacy. Given
the context of the Cold War, however, and the clear opportu-
nities Reagan had to call for more significant military adven-
turism, Reagan's foreign policy was a cautious one. . Pat
Buchanan seems to sway between isolationism and this kind
of cautious realism. His recent views on ISIS, focused on
containment and limited U.S. involvement, fit well into this
cautious realist category (Buchanan, 2014). Many war weary
grassroots conservatives also fit here as well.
The non-interventionists and cautious realists make up
the dovish wing of the conservative big tent. It is made up of
libertarians, paleoconservatives, and center-right pragmatists
such as Senator Tom Coburn. Although their reasoning dif-
fers, they usually prefer non-intervention. The intervention-
ists are likewise divided into an idealist and realist wing.
The hawkish realists share a pragmatic view of the world
with their cautious counterparts. Hawkish realists are equally
aware of power politics and are constantly concerned with
that power balance. However, hawkish realists believe that
frequent displays of military prowess are necessary to ensure
balance. Although they view frequent military intervention
as wise and prudent, they do not believe that the United
States can effectively "make the world safe for democracy"
through military adventurism. Hawkish realists believe that
there are constant threats overseas that must be pacified, for
they are likely to attack in time if left to develop freely.
Wagner 3
Henry Kissinger easily fits into this "hawkish realist" cat-
egory. He was a supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and
despite a few minor criticisms of some of President George
W. Bush's tactics, he has maintained his position since that
time. Although more cautious realists believe that nuclear
warheads make war less likely due to the extremely high
death toll of destruction of entire cities, Kissinger (2001) is
far more concerned:
Nuclear weapons have rendered war between countries
possessing them less likely--though this statement is unlikely to
remain valid if nuclear weapons continue to proliferate into
countries with a different attitude toward human life or
unfamiliar with their catastrophic impact. (p. 23)
In contrast, non-interventionists and cautious realists
alike believe that even if Iran, for example, develops nuclear
warheads, they will not use them as the rest of the world
would unite against Iran and dismantle the entire regime. The
hawks would rather not take that chance on Iran's
rationality.
Among grassroots conservatives, much of the "Palinite"
wing of the Tea Party movement also fits into this hawkish
realist school of thought. Few of them, including Sarah Palin,
have any interest in "policing the world," but eagerly support
the "war on terror" and maintain a significant U.S. military
presence in the world. Much of the Republican Party in
Congress can also favors a hawkish realist foreign policy,
including Newt Gingrich, Olympia Snowe, Susan Collins,
and so on. These are mostly post­Reagan era Republicans
who have supported maintaining a strong national defense
and U.S. military presence in the world, but typically stop
short of believing that the United States can impose indefi-
nitely its own moral principles on the world. However, they
are quick to use military force on perceived threats, whereas
the cautious realists are more likely to weigh the costs and
prefer containment.
Realist foreign policy is always rooted in skepticism of
the ability of states to implement any significant normative
agenda due to a firm belief that the realities of power politics
will always render such efforts futile. Therefore, realists
across the spectrum will inevitably reject the possibility of
any lasting world peace and consider such efforts to be coun-
terproductive. Hence, in their view, the world will never truly
be "safe for democracy."
Whatever neoconservatives may say of Woodrow Wilson,
they seem to share his view that the might of the U.S. mili-
tary can "make the world safe for democracy." Although
neoconservatives share the hawkish realist support for fre-
quent military intervention, they have the far more ambitious
goal of maintaining an unrivaled U.S. global hegemony.
Some neoconservatives, such as Charles Krauthammer,
embrace elements of realism as well. Krauthammer has
described himself as a "democratic-realist," and much of his
tone echoes classic realism. His views on the danger of
emerging "weapons states," for example, are compatible
with Henry Kissinger's concerns mentioned earlier. However,
neoconservative efforts to impose an international order,
even if unilaterally determined by the might of the United
States, are incompatible with centuries of realist thought on
foreign policy since the time of Klemens von Metternich.
For example, Krauthammer wrote in his famous 1990-1991
essay, that "[o]ur best hope for safety . . . is an American
strength and will--the strength and will to lead a unipolar
world, unashamedly laying down the rules of world order
and being prepared to enforce them" (p. 33). Krauthammer
represents a neoconservative goal that is very ambitious and
unlikely, but, like the realists, avoids the kind of abstract
moral justifications offered by the standard bearers of post­
Cold War neoconservativism. Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan
have a similar view to Krauthammer that "American hege-
mony is the only reliable defense against a breakdown of
peace and international order" (Kristol & Kagan, p. 22,
1996). However, they also have a clear normative agenda, as
follows:
In the 1990s conservatives have built their agenda on two pillars
of Reaganism: relimiting government to curtail the most
intrusive and counterproductive aspects of the modern welfare
state, and reversing the widespread collapse of morals and
standards in American society. But it is hard to imagine
conservatives achieving a lasting political realignment in this
country without the third pillar: a coherent set of foreign policy
principles that at least bear some resemblance to those
propounded by Reagan. The remoralization of America at home
ultimately requires the remoralization of American foreign
policy. For both follow from Americans belief that the principles
of the Declaration of Independence are not merely the choices of
a particular culture but are universal, enduring, self-evident
truths.That has been, after all, the main point of the conservatives
war against a relativistic multiculturalism. For conservatives to
preach the importance of upholding the core elements of the
Western tradition at home, but to profess indifference to the fate
of American principles abroad, is an inconsistency that cannot
help but gnaw at the heart of conservatism. (Kristol & Kagan, p.
30, 1996)
Neoconservatism has long been difficult to reconcile with
many conservative core values. Bill Kristol and Robert
Kagan made the case for this rather effectively, as seen
above. However, the cost of constant military intervention
clearly clashes with fiscal conservatism, as the U.S. budget
over the last century has never been balanced during a full
scale war. The assumption of a universal desire for democ-
racy neoconservatives is difficult to reconcile with the pref-
erence for tradition and global diversity held by most
conservative intellectuals. Furthermore, military interven-
tion has drastic consequences for the culture of the nation
engaged, inevitably expands the size and scope of govern-
ment, and thus clearly rattles the preference for status quo
and gradual, incremental change preferred by more
4 SAGE Open
traditional conservatives, and even neoconservatives on
domestic policy. This is to be expected, as neoconservatives
did not so much embrace the conservative label initially as
they had it thrust upon them. Doves in the "New Deal
Coalition" were labeling them "neoconservatives" long
before Irving Kristol decided to embrace the label.
Conservatives, led by Reagan, welcomed neoconservatives
into the then-emerging conservative big tent, primarily due
to mutual anti-communism. Neoconservatism should have
been a victim of its own success when the Soviet Union col-
lapsed. However, from September 11, 2001, until about
2005, the conservative movement was dominated by neocon-
servatives and hawkish realists. Max Boot was somewhat
critical of realist-conservatives but still seemed to accept
them as fellow conservatives. Leading up to Operation Iraqi
Freedom, for example, Boot noted that these realists "believe
that we should remove, or at least disarm, Saddam Hussein,
but not occupy Iraq for any substantial period afterward"
(Boot, 2002). He was referring in particular to Henry
Kissinger's position. Boot (2002) was particularly dismis-
sive of Pat Buchanan, however, sarcastically referring to
"Mr. Buchanan and his five followers."
Keeping Neoconservatism Alive--The
Bush years
Ty Solomon closely examined the psychological effects of
the neoconservatives during the 1990s and 2000s. The neo-
conservatives spent much of the 1990s first clarifying exactly
what it meant to be a neoconservative after the fall of the
Soviet Union and then on how to present their message in a
way that would appeal to grassroots conservatives. These
grassroots conservatives usually have a realist view of the
world, shifting from borderline isolationism to hawkish real-
ism, depending on the circumstances. William Kristol and
Robert Kagan were effective in tying their adventurous for-
eign policy preferences to traditional values held by both
conservative thinkers and the grassroots. Solomon (2013)
explains how Kristol and Kagan appealed to human desire
for wholeness and something lacking.
Kristol and Kagan harken back to the days when Reagan, in their
view, summoned US spiritual and military might, stared down
the Soviet Union, and won the Cold War for the side of freedom,
and when Teddy Roosevelt inspired Americans to embrace their
global responsibilities . . .The United States is missing something
that it had in the past. (Solomon, p. 115, 2003)
By appealing to many classic American conservative sig-
nifiers such as "American exceptionalism," "freedom," and
so on, as well as a sense that America was losing something
it once had, grassroots conservatives would be convinced to
support a far more proactive United States than is intuitive
for them.
It is difficult to determine whether this psychological
appeal was intentional by neoconservatives. This would
require significant research focused solely on that question.
Solomon was careful never to accuse the neoconservatives of
purposefully manipulating grassroots conservatives through
psychological trickery, and this essay will also avoid such an
accusation. Solomon's analysis of the psychological impact
of neoconservative rhetoric is still very helpful in under-
standing the neoconservative influence on foreign policy
within the conservative big tent, and that is why it is refer-
enced here.
Solomon focused the much of the first half of his study on
Charles Krauthammer's essay "The Unipolar Moment."
Although Krauthammer's essay was respected by academics,
the fear of weapons states could at best convince grassroots
to take a more hawkish approach to realism. The Kristol/
Kagan appeal to American values, however, was one that
would resonate, as it tapped into the decades-old sentiment
held by many grassroots conservatives that America was los-
ing its values, and that this would result in a diminished
nation for future generations of Americans.
By September 10, 2001, neoconservatives had perfected
their message, but grassroots conservatives still had little
interest in military adventurism. Walter Russell Mead has
studied the Tea Party movement and the long tradition of
grassroots rightist populism in America. He traces this back
to the time of Andrew Jackson, and labels this group of
Americans who now make up the conservative grassroots as
"Jacksonian." These Jacksonians, in an ideal world, would
prefer an isolationist foreign policy. They love the American
way of life and distrust foreigners. If these foreigners are not
a threat, they would rather simply avoid contact with them.
They have no desire, as the neoconservatives, to bring
democracy to the rest of the world. However, "when the
United States is attacked, they believe in total war leading to
the unconditional surrender of the enemy" (Mead, W. R,
2011). If the Jacksonians, these grassroots conservatives,
could be convinced that spreading democracy abroad was
correlative with American way of life, particularly security,
then they could be convinced to support more broad-based
military intervention and perhaps even nation-building, fear-
ing that they could not afford to do otherwise.
The terror attacks of September 11, 2001, rattled the san-
ity of nearly all Americans, particularly the Jacksonians, or
grassroots conservatives. For the neoconservatives, this reaf-
firmed their belief that global democracy was necessary for
security. The Jacksonians, as a result, were more receptive to
this ideal. The neoconservatives then sought to spread
democracy by force to the Mid-East, with these terror attacks
as their justification. The Jacksonians were primarily con-
cerned with punishing the terrorists but rarely objected to the
nation-building efforts of the neoconservatives. For the
Jacksonian, defeat of the enemy was what mattered, and as
long as that condition was met, they were willing to tolerate
other policy goals with their allies.
During the period from September 11, 2001, to about 2005,
the conservative big tent became increasingly small in terms of
ideas. Non-interventionists were exiled, paleoconservatives
Wagner 5
like Pat Buchanan found unlikely allies from the left as he
became an MSNBC commentator, and realists who opposed
the invasion of Iraq were marginalized. Ron Paul, the lone-
star non-interventionist in the House Republican Caucus at
the time, believed that if the United States pulled out of the
Islamic world, groups like Al-Qaeda would have no reason
to attack. President Bush, embracing a more neoconservative
response to the attacks, argued that "they hate our freedom";
hence, it was a war of ideologies rather than of power poli-
tics. Although not all conservatives calling for war necessar-
ily believed in George W. Bush's idealistic explanation, they
did fully support the invasion of Afghanistan, and most fully
supported the invasion of Iraq, despite the lack of evidence
for Iraq's involvement with the 9/11 attacks. Bush did attempt
to justify the invasion of Iraq by tying them to Al-Qaeda
(Hayes, 2003). However, he focused most of his justification
on claims that Iraq was violating UN requirements for
WMDs, and pointed to Hussein's poor human rights record.
The WMD argument convinced enough of the realists, and
the neoconservatives simultaneously harped the human
rights argument. Some of the Jacksonians, culturally isolated
and reactionary, likely believed that there were ties between
Hussein and Al-Qaeda for the simple reason that they are all
Islamic and hostile to the United States. Most of them, how-
ever, were knowledgeable enough to know that the entire
Islamic world as a whole was not to blame for the 9/11
attacks. For the majority of Jacksonians, their support for the
war in Iraq rested on the belief that Iraq was a significant
threat. As time passed, and no evidence of any usable WMDs
was found, the neocon­Jacksonian alliance began to frag-
ment. A growing number of conservative realists in Congress
began to question Bush and the decision to invade Iraq, and
some of these realists would later embrace the Tea Party
movement. From 2006 to the present, we are seeing the costs
of neoconservative foreign policy. Due to a growing national
debt as a percentage of GDP, and the clear philosophical con-
flicts between small government rhetoric on domestic
policy and an ever expansive, unconstrained foreign
policy;neoconservatives are finding it more difficult to reso-
nate with grassroots conservatives.
By 2006, the war in Iraq had become widely unpopular,
and American voters punished the GOP by sweeping the
Democrats into power. To add insult to injury, the Democrats
found a Presidential candidate in 2008 with an Islamic name
and an Islamic father. This is clearly not the reason that
Democrats nominated Obama, but it certainly agitated some
of the remaining Jacksonian hawks. It was clear at this point
that a hawkish Bush era Republican platform simply could
not win. Despite John McCain's "maverick" opposition to
Bush on many issues, McCain was and is even more hawkish
than Bush. This was at least part of the reason that McCain
lost in 2008. It is doubtful that Pat Buchanan or Max Boot
predicted that libertarianism would open the flaps allowing
the doves to flock back into the conservative big tent, but we
have seen this happen in recent years with Ron Paul, the Tea
Party movement, and the more pragmatic Rand Paul. Despite
recent fears of ISIS, we are not likely to see the calls for
nation-building and putting "freedom on the march" from
the younger generation of conservatives. The national debt is
far too high, the military budget is bloated, and younger con-
servatives can easily see the correlation between warfare and
government growth. Given the costly failures in Iraq, Libya,
and Syria, just to name a few;grassroots conservatives,
young and old, and likely to limit military intervention to the
suppression of immediate threats.
The Tea Party--Are Hawks Welcome
Here?
The Republicans knew that if they wanted to win in 2010,
they needed to accomplish two goals: cripple Obama's popu-
larity and convince voters that the GOP is no longer the Bush
party. The hawks would spend the next several years focus-
ing on domestic policy, knowing that voters had no taste for
war. The first goal was met by overwhelming obstructionism
in Congress, despite being outnumbered. Senate Republicans
filibustered nearly every bill attempted by the Democrats.
This strategy helped to re-mobilize conservative grassroots
voters, but elections are not won with the base voters alone.
The GOP needed to grow their support.
The time had come for Ron Paul and the non-interven-
tionists to return from exile. Originally, the Tea Party had no
more love for Bush and mainstream Republicans than they
had for Obama. As they grew in number, public opinion of
the Tea Party movement became increasingly polarized. In
March 2010, Gallup showed that of those polled throughout
the year, 37% had a favorable view of the Tea Party com-
pared with 40% who viewed them unfavorably ("Tea Party
Movement," 2014). They were controversial but had a strong
base of support. Some on the left attempted to find common
ground with the Tea Party, and President Obama reached out
to them more than once seeking solutions to the debt crisis.
The Tea Party initially had the popularity they needed but not
the financial resources. Fortunately for them, the conserva-
tive/libertarian establishment jumped on the opportunity.
As the 2010 mid-term elections came near, funds from
wealthy contributors such as the libertarian Koch brothers
began to pour into the coffers of different Tea Party groups.
Groups such as "Freedom Works" supported the Tea Party
movement as well. Pundits of the conservative big tent, such
as Rush Limbaugh, who despised Ron Paul, embraced the
Tea Party and simply ignored the movement's Paulite ori-
gins. Ron Paul did not create the Tea Party, it simply formed
around him. This is difficult to prove, as the movement was
spurious and had not yet gained the attention of mainstream
media. There is a video on YouTube, however, showing an
early Tea Party demonstration in 2007 in support of Ron
Paul. In this rare footage, Ron Paul supporters were carrying
crates labeled with policies they opposed, to symbolically
dump into the river ("Ron Paul Rockford Tea Party," 2007).
6 SAGE Open
Early in, Paul seemed to have a positive view of the move-
ment but never attempted to lead them. The movement
became widely popular following the famous Rick Santelli
rant in 2009 and, as a result, created the misconception that
this movement actually began with Santelli. For most,
including Walter Russell Mead, this was an honest mistake.
However, it clearly worked to the advantage of desperate
hawks. If these hawks were to be welcomed into the Tea
Party, they needed Ron Paul to be as far removed as
possible.
The Tea Party groups accepted the large corporate dona-
tions, but most of them kept to their libertarian-leaning prin-
ciples, criticizing corporate welfare just as fiercely as food
stamps. Likewise, the massive military industrial complex
was perceived to be just as wasteful and bloated as every
other function of government and needed to tighten its belt.
Amy Kremer, leader of the Tea Party Express, was inter-
viewed on the "Colbert Report" and solidly defended the
principles of the Tea Party. She refused to support tax
increases under any circumstances and continued to argue
for across the board spending cuts. When pinned down, she
pointed to a particular spending cut that the military could
make, as an alternative to tax increases (Kremer, 2011).
However, it is not Kremer's Tea Party Express or the Tea
Party Patriots that were highlighted by the mainstream
media. Sarah Palin represents good ratings for mainstream
media, and solid ideology for rightist establishment media,
mainly FOX. It was therefore in the best interest of most
mainstream media sources to highlight Sarah Palin and the
"Tea Party Nation," even though the other Tea Party groups
have largely severed ties to this particular group, and Sarah
Palin gets mixed reviews from Tea Party advocates.
As the Tea Party movement lacks unity and hierarchy, and
much of the developments were at the grassroots level, it is
hard to explain exactly how the Palinite hawks grew within
the movement. But it is likely that they simply started show-
ing up at Tea Party rallies, first only promoting ideas upon
which they agreed, such as tax cuts, spending cuts, and any-
thing anti-Obama. It is clear that as the 2010 mid-terms drew
near, an increasingly hawkish voice began to emerge from
the Tea Party. Some Tea Party candidates, such as Rand Paul
and Mike Lee, continued to reject military adventurism.
Others, however, like Allen West and Marco Rubio, used Tea
Party rhetoric, speaking of limited government and the dan-
gers of national debt, while likewise promoting a very costly
foreign policy of military adventurism. As anti-Obama senti-
ment held the Tea Party together, most did not even notice
that these new Tea Party candidates had more in common
with Bush Jr. and Palin than they did with Ron Paul and the
early libertarians who started the movement. The 2010 victo-
ries were at least a short term victory for hawkish conserva-
tives. However, it was not long before the Tea Party's
popularity declined, and disillusioned libertarians started
looking elsewhere. What remains of the Tea Party seems to
be focused on returning to their libertarian origins, particu-
larly the Tea Party Express, and they are crossing their fin-
gers for a Rand Paul GOP nomination in 2016.
Neoconservatives Now--Staying Alive
Public opinion polls still show that Republicans are divided on
their support for U.S. military commitments overseas.
Furthermore, "Tea Party Republicans" are slightly less likely to
support reducing military spending than other Republicans and
other Americans in general. Still, according to a Pew Research
Poll, 55% of "Tea Party Republicans" supported reducing mili-
tary commitments overseas in 2011 (Pew Research Center for
the People, 2011). It is a slim majority, but still a majority. So if
the majority is so slim, it may seem hasty to conclude that
hawkishness is on an almost irreversible decline.
One must consider this 55% figure more carefully, how-
ever. The poll was taken in 2011. By 2011, the Tea Party
movement was increasingly made up of older, mostly
Caucasian Republicans. The Tea Party was also declining in
popularity. The Tea Party was far more popular in 2009-2010
when it was more libertarian leaning and was propelling Rand
Paul to the U.S. Senate in an uphill battle against an incum-
bent Republican. It is difficult to prove cause and effect here,
and this essay will not attempt to do so. However, it is undeni-
able that younger Americans are far less favorable to military
intervention than older Americans. Republicans, therefore,
have far more to gain in future elections by shifting to a less
aggressive foreign policy. As has already been explained in
this essay and many other essays before, the hawkishness of
the conservative movement was largely a result of the Cold
War. Still, with recent fears of emerging ISIS, it is likely that
public support for cutting military spending or commitments
overseas has at least temporarily declined.
Grassroots conservatives today have little reason to sup-
port a neoconservative foreign policy other than lingering
attitudes from the Cold War era. As tensions build with
Russia over Ukraine and Crimea, neoconservatives such as
John McCain remind fellow Republicans that Putin was once
a KGB agent. This red herring appeals to a generation that
lived in fear of the Soviet Union. To Americans who grew up
in the Reagan era or thereafter, it means very little. The 9/11
attacks gave hawks a temporary resurgence, but the terror
has faded as can be seen by popular support for withdrawal
from Afghanistan and Iraq. Realists across the spectrum are
likely to view future justifications for military intervention
with skepticism. Even Henry Kissinger (2014), though a
consistent supporter of Operation Iraqi Freedom, has admit-
ted that "the standard set by many supporters and critics of
the Iraq effort alike--proved beyond what the American
public would support and what Iraqi society could accom-
modate" (p. 325). Kissinger consistently rejected "nation-
building" efforts in Iraq, and it is likely that he and other
hawkish realists will in future demand clearer and more lim-
ited goals when undertaking future military interventions
than will be to the liking of the neoconservatives.

Neoconservatives will need to find a way to appeal to
younger generations if they are to endure as the baby boomer
generation dies off. Furthermore, with soaring national debt
and a weak economic recovery, fiscal realities will also be a
major challenge for the neoconservatives to overcome.
Krauthammer, in his famous essay "The Unipolar Moment,"
argued that a strong military would be sustainable, but
blamed tax cuts and growing entitlements for America's fis-
cal woes (which were far less severe at that time in 1991). It
would be nearly impossible to convince Americans to sup-
port tax increases or any significant entitlement cuts, how-
ever, making it nearly impossible to avoid the over US$600
billion a year Defense budget, which is second only to Social
Security in its annual cost.
Libertarianism, with its rebellious appeal to conservative
youth, is likely to grow. It is, however, limited by its inflexi-
bility on welfare spending and its foreign policy of total non-
intervention. Most Americans do not want a full withdrawal
of all U.S. troops from all parts of the world when there are
clear threats emerging, such as rising China, ISIS, and Russia
in the Ukraine. The poll mentioned earlier also shows that
despite the 55% support among "Tea Party Republicans" for
reduced military commitments overseas, only 18% support
cutbacks to military defense spending, indicating a shift
toward realism, rather than libertarian non-intervention. The
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is clearly not as dangerous
as was the Soviet Union, but the popular viewpoint accord-
ing to this poll and many others is that China must be con-
tained. Realists have favored this approach for at least a
decade (Walt, 2011). Recently, this has begun to resonate
with the grassroots conservatives, due to the CCP's unscru-
pulous trade practices and their ally North Korea, which is a
menace to South Korea and Japan. Libertarians do not have
a solution to this, other than "free trade," which they hope
will foster mutual prosperity followed by peace. A growing
number of Americans oppose "free trade," at least with
China, due to likely currency manipulation and reputation
for poor quality products. Libertarians will not be able to
resonate with grassroots conservatives very effectively on
foreign policy issues once these details are debated.
The neoconservatives lately have shown signs that they
might attempt a more centrist platform (Heilbrunn, 2009).
John McCain has referred to the libertarian-Paulite wing of
the GOP as "wacko-birds" for their opposition to many anti-
terrorist surveillance programs. Other prominent hawkish
Republicans, such as Lisa Murkowski and Kelly Ayotte,
have been very critical of the radical Tea Party wing. There
is certainly a centrist void present in Congress, and the neo-
cons may have an opportunity to sell their message to disil-
lusioned centrist voters. It is likely that they are considering
Jeb Bush. Marco Rubio is also a possibility for them, though
he lacks the same "moderate" credentials. Whereas John
McCain represents the hawks of the GOP establishment, his
former running mate, Sarah Palin, represents the hawks of
the grassroots. Although Palin shows no interest in moving
to the center, the establishment hawks may go this route,
thereby building a new grassroots base. Many Paulites play
into the hawkish migration to the center by denouncing the
"moderate" hawks as "RINOs."
The neoconservatives have certainly made a significant
impact on the conservative big tent. They not only survived
decades beyond their life expectancy (end of the Cold War),
but they also had an incredible impact on U.S. foreign policy
during the Bush era. Thinkers of the 1990s predicted a neo-
conservative demise with good reason, but the neocons have
persisted. Consequently, I am hesitant in this essay to make
what might be another failed prediction of neoconservative
decline. However, neoconservatives now find it very difficult
to convince the rest of the conservative big tent that fiscal
responsibility, the American way of life, family values, pref-
erence for tradition, and constitutionally limited government
are compatible with a one-size-fits-all democratic model for
the world and the military industrial complex necessary to
maintain American unipolarity. The present and future con-
servatives are likely to focus on fiscal responsibility and indi-
vidual freedom. As social liberals inevitably progress on
issues such as same-sex marriage, conservatives are shifting
their focus from direct opposition to instead the protection of
religious freedom (Arana, 2013). This far more modest goal
is to ensure that social conservatives do not lose their freedom
to maintain their more traditional lifestyles in a socially pro-
gressive future. This will require a culturally pluralist outlook
that clashes with the neoconservative one-size-fits-all world-
view. Limited government at home is ever more difficult to
reconcile with unlimited government abroad, and this new
generation of conservatives, unclouded by the specter of
Soviet communism, can afford philosophical consistency in
their efforts to limit the size of government and place greater
faith in the innovation of free individuals and voluntary asso-
ciation. If neoconservatives are to have a future beyond the
baby boomer generation, they will either need to find a way to
appeal to the more libertarian-leaning conservative youth or
branch out beyond the conservative big tent.
Conclusion
The main purpose of this essay is to show that American con-
servative foreign policy is far more complex than commonly
depicted by mainstream media or certain irritable pundits.
The secondary objective of this essay is to explain how neo-
conservatives have not only endured but also thrived after
the Cold War. Many did not expect this, even some neocon-
servatives. During the Bush era, it appeared that neoconser-
vatives were simply the standard bearers of conservative
foreign policy, with a tolerated realist minority. However,
other perspectives existed even then and have now re-
emerged to the point where they must be understood by the
GOP "Old Guard" and mainstream political culture. We will
still hear the terms right-winged or to the right commonly
used in reference to a hawkish foreign policy for some time

yet, as old habits die hard. However, the conservative tent
has become big again, at least for electoral necessity if noth-
ing else.
It is hard to say which, if any, of these groups will domi-
nate conservative foreign policy in America in the near
future. However, they are all at a point of influence now
where they must be carefully considered when looking at the
conservative movement and future GOP nominations.
Conservatives and their opponents alike would be well
served by understanding the complexities of the conservative
big tent. For hawkish conservatives, they must accommodate
their tent-mates. For more dovish conservatives, particularly
non-interventionists, they must understand that the situation
is far more complex than a simple black and white--neocon-
servative versus "real conservatives" scenario. American
"liberals" and Democratic opponents of the conservative big
tent should consider that a more dovish conservative could
easily blindside a hawkish Democratic candidate if party pri-
mary voters and strategists take for granted the assumption
that conservatives are inevitably hawkish. Pre­Cold War
conservatives were complex and disparate in their foreign
policy preferences, and such complexity has now returned to
the post Cold War conservative big tent.
The main purpose of this essay is to analyze the diversity
of foreign policy within the conservative big tent and provide
a model for understanding these different policy preferences.
This has been achieved by showing how nearly all conserva-
tives fit into at least one of these four categories: non-inter-
ventionist, cautious realist, hawkish realist, and
neoconservative. These four categories provide a better
understanding of conservative foreign policy preferences
among grassroots conservatives, intellectuals, and politi-
cians. The essay has shown, as others have before, that neo-
conservative dominance of conservative foreign policy has
been in decline since about 2006. It was necessary to re-
assert this, as many still take for granted the perception that
conservatives are hawkish. It has also been shown that there
are both philosophical and pragmatic reasons for conserva-
tives to reconsider the hawkish foreign policy for which "the
right" has become synonymous in the last several decades. It
is unlikely that the conservative big tent will retreat into iso-
lationism, as some neoconservatives fear. Although this
essay predicts a more cautious foreign policy preference
among conservatives going forward, this is a far cry from
isolationism. Most conservatives still want to maintain a
strong military, aid for U.S. allies, and beneficial trade rela-
tions. Neoconservatives certainly can adapt to this environ-
ment, and given the short memory span of the younger
generation, neoconservatives could find a way, yet again, to
return to prominence.
