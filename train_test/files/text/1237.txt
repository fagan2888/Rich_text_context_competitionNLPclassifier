Estimates of excess deaths associated with body mass index and
other anthropometric variables1­3
Katherine M Flegal and Barry I Graubard
ABSTRACT
Background: Estimates of excess mortality associated with body
mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) have been calculated for the US
population.
Objective: The objective of this article is to compare the excess
mortality associated with BMI levels to the excess mortality asso-
ciated with other anthropometric variables.
Design: For the 1988­1994 Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, estimates of excess deaths were calculated for
standard BMI levels and for comparable levels of percentage body
fat, waist circumference, hip and arm circumferences, waist-hip ratio,
the sum of 4 skinfold thicknesses, and waist-stature ratio. The out-
come measure is the percentage of deaths in the full sample in excess
of those predicted for the reference category.
Results: For the level equivalent to BMI ,18.5, estimates of excess
deaths ranged from 0.3% for waist-hip ratio to 2.4% for percentage
body fat. All except waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, and waist-
stature ratio were significantly greater than zero (P , 0.05). For the
level equivalent to BMI 25 to ,30, the percentage of excess deaths
was 0.1% for percentage body fat and negative for all other variables;
estimates were significantly below zero only for circumferences and
waist-stature ratio. For the level equivalent to BMI 30, estimates
ranged from 21.7% for waist circumference to 1.5% for percentage
of fat; none were significantly different from zero. Estimates for all-
cause mortality, obesity-related causes of death, and other causes of
death showed no statistically significant or systematic differences
between BMI and other variables.
Conclusion: In this population-based study, attributable frac-
tions of deaths were similar across measures. Am J Clin Nutr

INTRODUCTION
Body mass index [BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2] is a measure
of weight adjusted for height. Because weight and height are
relatively easy to measure and because BMI is relatively highly
correlated with body fat, BMI is often used in epidemiologic
studies to assess adiposity. However, it is an imperfect measure
because it does not assess body fatness directly (1). Another
anthropometric indicator sometimes suggested to be used in-
stead of BMI is waist circumference, which may be more
closely related to adiposity, particularly visceral adiposity, than
is BMI and thus may be a better indicator of the risk associated
with adiposity (2). Another approach to measuring adiposity is
the use of skinfold thicknesses (2, 3). Bioelectrical impedance
can also provide estimates of body fatness (4). Combinations of
different variables such as the ratio of waist circumference to hip
circumference can also be used (5).
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III, 1988­1994) provides a set of standardized mea-
surements of body size and composition in a representative
sampleoftheUSpopulation,includingBMI,percentageoffatfrom
bioelectrical impedance, skinfold thicknesses, and circumference
measurements of waist, hip, and arm. Mortality follow-up data
make it possible to assess the extent to which various anthropo-
metric measures can predict mortality risk. These data have been
used to estimate the excess deaths associated with different BMI
categories (6, 7).
The objective of this study was to compare estimates of excess
deaths associated with BMI categories with estimates of excess
deaths associated with other possible indicators of body size or
composition in a large nationally representative study.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
NHANES III was conducted from 1988 to 1994 by the National
Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. A nationally representative cross-sectional sample of
the US civilian noninstitutionalized population was selected using
a complex, stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling de-
sign. A description of the plan and operation of the survey has been
published (8). NHANES III underwent institutional review board
approval and included written informed consent.
Waist circumference, hip circumference, arm circumference,
skinfold-thicknessmeasurements,bioelectricalimpedance,weight,
and height were measured using standardized techniques and
equipment (8). Waist circumference measurements were made just

Control and Prevention, Hyattsville, MD (KMF), and the Division of Cancer
Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD (BIG).

above the iliac crest. Hip circumference measurements were made
at the largest protuberance of the buttocks. Arm circumference was
measured at the midpoint of the arm and BMI was calculated.
Percentage body fat was calculated from resistance and reactance
measurements using previously published formulas (9, 10). Waist-
hip ratio (WHR) was calculated as waist circumference (cm)/hip
circumference(m).Skinfold-thicknessmeasurementsweremadeat
4 sites (triceps, subscapula, suprailium, and thigh) and summed
together. For the purposes of this study, skinfold values that were
above the maximum of 55 mm that could be measured with the
calipers used were arbitrarily assigned a higher value of 60 mm.
Waist-stature ratio (WSR) was calculated as waist circumference
(cm)/height (m).
For mortality data we used the NHANES III Linked Mortality
File from the National Center for Health Statistics (11). The
National Center for Health Statistics has conducted a mortality
linkage of NHANES III to death certificate data found in the
National Death Index. The NHANES III Linked Mortality File
provides mortality follow-up data from the date of NHANES III
survey participation (1988­1994) through 31 December 2000.
Linkage of the NHANES III survey participants with the National
Death Index provides the opportunity to conduct studies designed
to investigate the association of a wide variety of health factors
with mortality.
To estimate relativerisks, we used baseline data fromNHANES
III (1988­1994) and mortality data from the NHANES III Linked
MortalityFilethrough2000.Baselineagewasageatthetimeofthe
examination. We calculated relative risks of mortality using Cox
proportional hazard models with age as the time scale (12). We fit
models separately in 4 age­sex strata for men and women aged
25­,70 and 701 y. The model included levels of the specified
anthropometric variable (low, reference, intermediate, or high),
smoking status (never, former, or current), race (white, black, or
other), and alcohol consumption categories in ounces per day
(none, ,0.07, 0.07­,0.35, or 0.35).
The sample of respondents aged 25 y examined in the mobile
examination center in NHANES III included 6920 men and 7627
nonpregnant women with complete BMI data and mortality
follow-up data. Of these, 327 men and 414 women had missing
values for waist circumference and an additional 364 men and
523 women had missing values for resistance from the bio-
electrical impedance measures. The final analytic sample in-
cluded 12,919 men and nonpregnant women who had complete
data for BMI and other anthropometric variables. However, for
statistical pairwise comparisons of variables, all available data for
the 2 variables being compared were used.
Categorical estimates
For categorical analyses, we grouped BMI as follows: ,18.5
(underweight), 18.5­,25 (reference category), 25­,30 (over-
weight),and 30 (obesity). These followed federal guidelines (13).
When comparing the results from levels of BMI values with
levels of other anthropometric variables, differences might be
introduced simply because the categories reflect different points
in the distribution. To control for this effect, researchers not
infrequently divide all variables into quintiles or other compa-
rable categories of equal size for all variables (14­23). We
followed a similar procedure, except that, instead of quintiles,
we used the standard BMI cutoffs to form categories and then
created levels for the other anthropometric variables that were
prevalence matched to the standard BMI cutoffs. In other words,
these categories were created by using cutoffs that would iden-
tify the same proportion of the population as did the standard
BMI cutoffs. For purposes of analysis, these levels are termed
low (corresponding to BMI ,18.5), reference (corresponding to
BMI 18.5­,25), intermediate (corresponding to BMI 25­,30),
and high (corresponding to BMI 30).
Estimation of excess deaths
We calculated the number of excess deaths associated with dif-
ferentlevelsofeachanthropometricvariableindividually(including
BMI itself) by using similar methods to those described previously
(6, 24). Because many indicators, such as percentage body fat or
waist circumference, display marked differences by sex, we al-
lowed relative risks to vary by sex and age. We calculated excess
deathswithineachsex­agegroupand summedthemoverthewhole
sample. This approach has the advantage of providing a metric that
can be summed over age and sex groups to obtain a sample total
while still allowing for variation in relative risks by sex and age. It
uses sex- and age-specific information on the prevalence of the
given anthropometric level and mortality, combined with relative
risk information, to estimate the sample burden of mortality asso-
ciated with the given anthropometric level, which cannot be as-
sessed from relative risk estimates alone. For these analyses, unlike
our previous work (6, 7) we did not extrapolate the results to na-
tional mortality data. The estimates presented here are for the
(weighted) NHANES III sample. In part because of the high cor-
relations among anthropometric variables, this methodology is
not suited to making excess death calculations for 2 variables
simultaneously.
We express the excess deaths as a percentage of total sample
deaths. Although this methodology is a form of attributable frac-
tion methodology, this is a measure of association and does not
necessarily indicate a causal relation. Within each level of a given
anthropometric variable, we divided the number of excess deaths
by the total number of deaths in the sample to create an estimate of
population attributable fraction for each anthropometric level. For
a given anthropometric level, this can be interpreted as the per-
centage of total deaths in the sample that are in excess of (or fewer
than) those that would be predicted if people in that anthropometric
level instead had been in the reference level for that variable, with
theothercovariatesofagegroup,sex,raceorethnicgroup,smoking,
and alcohol consumption all held constant.
All analyses were conducted using the SAS System for
Windows (release 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and Research
Triangle Institute's SUDAAN (release 9.0; Research Triangle In-
stitute, Research Triangle Park, NC) software programs. All
analyses included sample weights that account for the varying
probabilities of selection due to sampling and nonresponse.
Standard errors were calculated by applying a delta method for
complex sample designs that takes into account uncertainties in
the relative risks for the levels of an anthropometric variable, the
distribution of the anthropometric variable in the sample, the
distribution of covariates, and the estimated effects of covariates,
as well as the added variability due to the complex sample design
of the NHANES surveys (24, 25). Statistical testing of the dif-
ference between excess deaths associated with levels of one an-
thropometric variable and excess deaths associated with the

corresponding levels of another anthropometric variable were de-
termined by t tests in which the denominator of the test statistic was
the SE of the difference obtained from the delta method. These t
tests used 49 df, which is equal to the number of primary sample
units minus the number of sample strata. To partially account for
multiple comparisons, statistical significance was set at the P ,
0.0024 level to test the 21 pairwise differences within a given level
of the anthropometric variables without additionally adjusting for
the 4 levels, which would have led to a smaller P value.
RESULTS
Basic descriptive information about the sample is shown in
Table 1. Correlation coefficients for the different variables with
each other and with height are shown in Table 2. Most of the
variables were highly correlated with each other.
Cutoffs for categorization of anthropometric variables
The percentile values for waist circumference and other vari-
ables that correspond, in the sense of identifying the same pro-
portion of the distribution, to the specified BMI cutoffs are shown
in Table 3. Because of rounding, the values are not always exactly
the identical percentile, but they are close. For example, for
women, a percentage fat value of ,16.0% or a waist circum-
ference value of ,67.1 cm produces prevalence estimates similar
to a BMI ,18.5 (see Table 3). In this sample, 3.29% of women
had BMI values ,18.5, 3.31% had percentage fat values
,16.0%, and 3.22% had waist circumference values ,67.1 cm.
Although the prevalence is the same, an individual might fall
into one BMI category and not into the matched category of the
other variable. For example, of men in the BMI category of 18.5­
,25, 69% fell into the corresponding percentage fat category of
6.0­,19.9, 2% fell into a lower percentage fat category, and 29%
fell into a higher percentage fat category. The overall proportion
of people who fall into the corresponding categories of each pair
of the other anthropometric variables is shown in Table 4. In
most cases, from 50% to 75% of people were classified similarly
across variables. However, for WHR the percentage of agree-
ment tended to be lower.

formed from the cutoffs shown in Table 3. The estimated at-
tributable fractions of all-cause mortality, relative to the refer-
ence category, for low, intermediate, and high categories of each
variable, with 95% CIs, are shown in Figure 1. The attributable
fractions were generally similar for the low level of all variables.
All were small and positive, ranging from 0.3% (95% CI: 20.8,
1.4) for WHR to 2.5% (95% CI: 1.1, 3.9) for arm circumference.
The 95% CI included zero only for waist circumference, WHR,
and WSR. The fractions suggest that anywhere from 0.3% to
2.5% more deaths occurred in the sample than would have been
expected if the individuals at the low level had been in the
reference level instead.
For the intermediate level, relative to the reference level, the
only positive association was for percentage body fat, at 0.1%
(95% CI: 25.2, 5.4). For all other variables, the association was
negative, ranging from 21.8% (95% CI: 27.0, 3.3) for the sum of
skinfolds to 29% (95% CI: 214.2, 23.8) for hip circumference.
For circumference measures of waist, hip, and arm and for WSR,
the estimates were significantly below zero, but this was not the
case for the other measures. These estimates suggest that any-
where from 10.1% to 27% fewer deaths occurred in the sample
than would have been expected if the individuals at the in-
termediate level instead had been in the reference level. At-
tributable fraction estimates for the high level, relative to the
reference level, ranged from weakly negative [21.7% (95%
CI: 26.4, 2.9) for waist circumference] to weakly positive [1.5%
(95% CI: 22.2, 5.1) for percentage fat]. All CIs included zero.
Pairwise statistical tests comparing estimates of excess deaths
based on different variables with each other showed no significant
differences between estimates of excess deaths for any pair of
variables at any level based on a P value ,0.0012 for the 28
pairwise comparisons at each level; for the obese level, only 1 of
the 21 differences would have been significant at a P value of
0.05.
Excess deaths in a higher-risk group
To try to isolate a higher-risk group that might show more
clearly any differences between anthropometric measures and
create an outcome variable more strongly associated with adi-
posity, we calculated attributable fractions for deaths from a group
of conditions that included cardiovascular disease, obesity-related
cancers (colon cancer, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, uterine
cancer, ovarian cancer, kidney cancer, or pancreatic cancer) and
diabetes or kidney disease, which are all conditions shown pre-
viously to be associated with excess mortality among the obese (7,
17). The results for deaths from these causes are shown in Figure
2. The attributable fractions for these selected conditions associ-
ated with the low level, relative to the reference level, were all
quite small and close to zero; only the estimate for WHR differed
significantly from zero (20.5%, 95% CI: 20.8, 20.1).
For the intermediate level, BMI, waist circumference, and the
sum of skinfold thicknesses were nonsignificantly associated
with ,1% of either excess or decreased mortality from these

selected conditions. Percentage of fat showed a nonsignificantly
increased mortality of 6.5% (95% CI: 20.4, 13.5) and the other
variables showed a nonsignificantly decreased mortality with the
largest negative effect (27.8%, 95% CI: 219.4, 3.8) shown for
WHR. All CIs included zero.
For the high level, the highest estimates were for BMI (5.5%,
95% CI: 1.1, 9.9) and percentage of fat (4.4%; 95% CI: 0.2, 8.6).
For all other variables, estimates were also positive and 95% CIs
included zero. Despite some apparent differences, pairwise sta-
tistical tests comparing estimates of excess deaths on the basis of
different variables with each other showed no significant differ-
ences between estimates of excess deaths for any pair of variables
at any level, based on a P value ,0.0012 for the 28 pairwise com-
parisons at each level; for the obese level, none of the 21 dif-
ferences would have been significant even at a P value of 0.05.
Excess deaths for remaining causes of death
We also examined attributable fractions for the remaining
causes of death (all causes except cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
and obesity-related cancers) grouped together, with results as
shown in Figure 3. Relative to the reference level, the low level
tended to be associated with increased mortality from these causes
and the intermediate and high levels with decreased mortality from
these causes for all variables. Pairwise statistical tests comparing
estimates of excess deaths based on different variables with each
other were based on a P value ,0.0012 for the 28 pairwise com-
parisons at each level. The only significant difference at any level
was between waist circumferenceand arm circumferenceatthe low
level. For the obese level, none of the 21 differences would have
been significant at a P value of 0.05.
DISCUSSION
BMI is an imperfect measure of adiposity and its use in epi-
demiologic studies has been criticized (26­28). It is sometimes
suggested that weak or negative associations between BMI and
mortality are due to the lack of the ability of BMI to discriminate
between lean and fat mass and that associations would be
strengthened if different measures were used (29). In NHANES
III, associations between mortality and elevated BMI were weak,
with 1.2% (95% CI: 22.1, 4.4) of deaths associated with BMI in
the high (obese) range. However, the associations of the corre-
sponding levels of other anthropometric variables--including
waist, hip, and arm circumferences; percentage body fat estimated
from bioelectrical impedance; WHR; the sum of 4 skinfold
thicknesses, and the WSR--also tended to be weak and in general
were quite similar to the association of BMI with mortality. When
the mortality outcome was limited to selected causes of death
previously shown (7) to be associated with obesity (cardiovascular

disease, diabetes, kidney disease, and selected cancers), the as-
sociation of mortality and BMI in the obese range was stronger,
with 5.5% (95% CI: 1.1, 9.9) of deaths from these causes as-
sociated with BMI at the high (obese) level. At this level for
these causes of death, BMI was associated with a higher per-
centage of deaths than were the other anthropometric variables
considered. These findings do not suggest that the weak adi-
posity-mortality associations would be stronger if measures of
adiposity other than BMI were used.
When the mortality outcome was limited to other causes of
death (ie, excluding deaths due to cardiovascular disease, di-
abetes, kidney disease, and selected cancers), the associations of
BMI with mortality at the intermediate (overweight) or high
(obese) level were much weaker and generally negative, although
not significantly so.
Each of these measures of body size or composition has its
limitations. All are highly correlated with each other, which
suggests that they are inevitably collinear. As body size, assessed
by BMI, increases, percentage of fat tends to increase, body cir-
cumferences increase, and skinfold thicknesses increase. In all
3 sets of analyses, all variables had generally similar patterns of
excess deaths. No one variable consistently gave higher or lower
results than the others. Pairwise comparisons showed no significant
differences between variables for the estimates at any level. These
findings make it appear unlikely that in these population studies the
use of BMI produces appreciably lower or higher estimates of
excess mortality than would other measures of adiposity or body
size. However, in the NHANES III data, all associations were
weak. It is possible that in a sample with stronger associations
between body composition and mortality there would be clearer
differences between these anthropometric variables.
The reasons for associations between BMI and mortality are
imperfectly understood. It is often assumed that any associations
are due to the accumulation of adipose tissue, whether overall
adiposity or site-specific adiposity. However, the actual mech-
anism or mechanisms are not clear. Part of the association may be
related to incidence and part to survival, and the body size or
composition factors related to incidence may differ from those
that affect survival outcomes. In addition, the body size and
composition factors that affect the incidence of, or survival under,
certain conditions may differ across conditions. Given the likely
complexity of these associations, it may not be surprising to find
that results vary across studies conducted in different populations
at different times or with different outcomes.
Results in the literature generally compare relative risks rather
than absolute risks and are somewhat mixed. In a large case-
control study of survivors of myocardial infarctions, Yusuf et al
(22) found that WHR was a better predictor of the risk of
myocardial infarctions than were either BMI or waist circum-
ference. In contrast, in a meta-analysis of data on incident di-
abetes, Vazquez et al (30) found that results for waist
circumference, BMI, and WHR were all similar. In our analyses
of the NHANES III data, use of the WHR did not result in any
systematic differences from BMI or other individual variables.
WHR has been found in several studies to be a good predictor of
mortality or of incident cardiovascular disease. However, its
interpretation is somewhat uncertain. Both waist and hip cir-
cumferences are highly correlated with BMI or percentage body
fat individually, but their ratio is less correlated. Some evidence
suggests that the waist and hip have opposite effects on risk (31).
In addition, visceral adiposity may be strongly related to risk,
and measures such as BMI, waist circumference, or WHR
may be better measures of total body fat than of visceral adi-
posity (32).
Relative risks compare the risks at lower and higher levels of
a variable, but do not provide estimates of the overall contribution
of these levels to mortality. For example, it is possible that the
highest 10% of any variable identifies a group with similarly
elevated absolute risks but that the relative risks are higher for one
variable than for another because of differences in the absolute
risk in the reference category. The estimates presented here use
relative risk estimates as part of the calculations but also take into
account other factors to provide an estimate of the sample burden
of mortality, which cannot be assessed from relative risks alone.
These results suggest that, in terms of the associations with excess
deaths, a variety of measurements give similar results to those
found for BMI.
