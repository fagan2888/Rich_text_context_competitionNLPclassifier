Summary
Genetic variation in FOXO3A has previously been associ-
ated with human longevity. Studies published so far have
been case­control studies and hence vulnerable to bias
introduced by cohort effects. In this study we extended
the previous findings in the cohorts of oldest old Danes
(the Danish 1905 cohort, N = 1089) and middle-aged
Danes (N = 736), applying a longitudinal study design as
well as the case­control study design. Fifteen SNPs were
chosen in order to cover the known common variation in
FOXO3A. Comparing SNP frequencies in the oldest old
with middle-aged individuals, we found association (after
correction for multiple testing) of eight SNPs; 4
(rs13217795, rs2764264, rs479744, and rs9400239) previ-
ously reported to be associated with longevity and four
novel SNPs (rs12206094, rs13220810, rs7762395, and
rs9486902 (corrected P-values 0.001­0.044). Moreover, we
found association of the haplotypes TAC and CAC of
rs9486902, rs10499051, and rs12206094 (corrected P-values:
0.01­0.03) with longevity. Finally, we here present data
applying a longitudinal study design; when using follow-
up survival data on the oldest old in a longitudinal analysis,
we found no SNPs to remain significant after the
correction for multiple testing (Bonferroni correction).
Hence, our results support and extent the proposed role
of FOXO3A as a candidate longevity gene for survival
from younger ages to old age, yet not during old age.
Key words: human longevity; Forkhead box O3A

Introduction
Genetic factors contribute to the variation in human life span by
approximately 25% (Herskind et al. 1996), a contribution
believed to be minimal before age 60 years and most profound
from age 85 years onwards (Hjelmborg et al. 2006). Candidate
longevity genes encode proteins involved in several biological
processes including the insulin / IGF-1 signaling pathway (Chris-
tensen et al. 2006), in which the transcription factor forkhead
box O3A (Foxo3a) is of key importance.
Variation in the gene encoding Foxo3a (FOXO3A) has previ-
ously been reported to be associated with human longevity.
Willcox et al. (2008) first reported on the associations of
FOXO3A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with longevity
in male Americans of Japanese ancestry (rs2764264 (P-value
(P) = 0.0002), rs13217795 (P = 0.0006) and rs2802292
(P < 0.0001)), associations which were subsequently confirmed
(with effects pointing in the same direction) in Italian, American
(northern and western European ancestry), Chinese and Ger-
man populations (Anselmi et al. 2009; Flachsbart et al. 2009;
Li et al. 2009; Pawlikowska et al. 2009). These studies reported
6 of 16 tagging SNPs (five specific to males and one to females)
(Anselmi et al. 2009), 3 of 16 tagging SNPs (both genders)
(Flachsbart et al. 2009), 2 of 16 tagging SNPs (specific to
females) (Pawlikowska et al. 2009), and 3 of 3 tagging SNPs
(both genders) (Li et al. 2009) to be associated with longevity.
Furthermore, two studies reported on the associations of
FOXO3A haplotypes with longevity (Anselmi et al. 2009; Li et al.
2009).
The studies published so far have been case­control stud-
ies (comparing oldest old to younger controls), raising con-
cerns about possible cohort effects introducing bias
(Beekman et al. 2006; Christensen et al. 2006). In this study
we aimed to add further support and to extend the evidence
for a role of FOXO3A in longevity by investigating 15
FOXO3A SNPs covering the known common genetic variation
in FOXO3A in two populations of middle-aged and oldest
old Danes, applying the case­control study design (middle-
aged versus oldest old) as well as a longitudinal study design
(oldest old only).

Results
Genotype and allele frequencies
The FOXO3A SNPs investigated in this study and their relative
positions and linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks are shown in
Fig. 1. All 15 FOXO3A SNPs were in Hardy­Weinberg equilib-
rium in the control group (P > 0.05 / 15 SNPs) (data not shown).
The genotype and allele frequencies of the 15 SNPs for middle-
aged controls, nonagenarians, centenarians, and the combined
group of oldest old (nonagenarians + centenarians) are listed in
Supporting information Table S1. The frequencies of the rare
alleles and rare genotypes generally tended to be higher in the
oldest old when compared to the middle-aged controls. One
exception was rs13220810, where the frequency of the most
common allele and genotype was higher in the oldest old than
in the controls. The frequencies for the nonagenarians were in
general in between the frequencies for the middle-aged control
group and the centenarians, supporting an increase in allele and
genotype frequencies with age. Stratification by sex indicated
that these tendencies were most pronounced for males (data
not shown).
FOXO3A SNPs and longevity ­ Case­control analysis
P-values for the allelic frequency case­control comparisons
(PCCA) and the genotype frequency case­control comparisons
(PCCG) between the middle-aged and oldest old cohort are
listed in Supporting information Table S2; results for nominally
significant effects (P < 0.05) are listed in Table 1. Nominally sig-
nificant differences in allele frequencies were found for the
males for five SNPs (rs12206094, rs13220810, rs2802292,
rs3800231, and rs9486902), while with respect to genotype
frequencies, nominally significantly differences were found
for rs12206094, rs13220810, rs479744, rs7762395, and
rs9486902 (both genders combined) and for rs12206094,
rs13217795, rs13220810, rs2764264, rs2802292, rs3800231,
rs479744, rs7762395, rs9398172, rs9400239, and rs9486902
(males only). No nominally significant effects (either by PCCA or
PCCG) were found for the females.
To correct for multiple testing, while taking into account the
LD between the individual SNPs, permutation analysis was per-
formed using the Plink software. Data found to be nominally sig-
nificant, and the corresponding corrected values are listed in
Supporting information Table S3, while the results holding for
correction for multiple testing are listed in Table 2. Of the nomi-
nally significant findings (both genders combined), the PCCG
values for rs7762395 did hold for correction for multiple testing,
so did the PCCGs for rs12206094, rs13217795, rs13220810,
rs2764264, rs479744, rs7762395, rs9400239, and rs9486902
when restricting to males. None of the nominally significant
PCCA values remained significant.
FOXO3A haplotypes and longevity - Case­control
analysis
Three haplotype blocks were predicted in the gene region
analyzed (see Fig. 1); block 1: rs9486902, rs10499051,
rs12206094, rs2802292, and rs13220810, block 2:
rs2764264, rs7762395, rs12207868, rs13217795, rs9400239,
rs12212067, and rs9398172, and block 3: rs3800232. To test
the association with longevity of these haplotype blocks in our
sample, we used these haplotype definitions in Plink and
found nominally significant differences for block 1 between
the oldest old and the controls; haplotype CACTC, P = 0.03
and haplotype TACTT, P = 0.008 (both genders combined). To

investigate the haplotype structure in more detail, the `sliding
window' feature in the Plink software was applied (using a
window of three SNPs). Haplotype frequencies and P-values
from the haplotype frequency based case-control comparison
(PCCH) between the middle-aged and the oldest old are listed
in Supporting information Table S4, whereas data being nomi-
nally significant and data passing correction of multiple testing
are shown in Table 3.
For both genders combined, haplotypes in the following
windows were found to be nominally significant: window 1, 2, 3
and 4 (composed by SNPs rs9486902, rs10499051, rs12006094;
rs10499051, rs12006094, rs2802292; rs12006094, rs2802292,
rs132202810 and 2802292, rs132202810, rs2764264, respec-
tively). When stratifying by gender, males showed, in addition to
window 1­4, also significance for window 5 (rs13220810,
rs2764264, and rs7762395) and 13 (rs3800231, rs3800232, and
rs479744). As before, no effects were nominally significant for
the females.
When correcting for multiple testing, one window (and two
haplotypes) did hold for correction: window 1 (rs9486902,
rs10499051, and rs12206094) haplotypes TAC and CAC were
found to be significant for males only (see Table 3).

Case­control analysis of the centenarian group
separately
One hundred and forty three of the 1089 1905 cohort members
reached 100 years of age. Because the associations of FOXO3A
SNPs with longevity have previously been reported to be most
significant for centenarians (Flachsbart et al. 2009), we con-
ducted the association studies for the centenarian group sepa-
rately.
At the nominal significance level, most of the SNPs and haplo-
types found to be nominally significant for the entire group of
oldest old were also found to be significant for the centenarians
(the PCCAs, PCCGs, and PCCHs for the centenarian group are
listed in Supporting information Tables S2 and S4). When cor-
recting for multiple testing (see Supporting information
Table S3), only the PCCGs for rs772395 (both genders com-
bined) and rs2764264 (males only) were replicated in the cente-
narians (P-values (corrected) = 0.016 and 0.036, respectively),
whereas rs479744 was found to be significant for both genders
combined (P-value (corrected) = 0.024) not in males only, as
was found for the entire group of oldest old.
FOXO3A SNPs and longevity ­ Longitudinal study of
an extinct cohort of oldest old
In addition to the case-control setup, we analyzed the follow-up
survival data for oldest old (the results are listed in Supporting
information Table S5). When conducting Cox regression,
rs10499051, rs7762395 and rs9486902 were found to be nom-
inally associated with longevity: rs10499051 (GG) Hazard rate
(HR) = 0.496, P = 0.049, 95%CI = (0.247-0.997) for both
genders combined; rs10499051 (GG) HR = 0.360, P = 0.023,
95%CI = (0.149-0.869) for females only; rs7762395 (AA)
HR = 2.065, P = 0.009, 95%CI = (1.195-3.569) for males only;
and rs9486902 (TT) HR = 1.739, P = 0.041; 95% CI = (1.022-
2.951) for males only. When correcting for multiple testing by
Bonferroni correction (P < 0.05/2*15 SNPs = 0.00166) it was,
however, evident that none of the results remained significant.
Discussion
Numerous genes and variations have up until now been investi-
gated for their contribution to human longevity, often demon-
strating difficulties in replicating the initial findings, the only
exception being the APOE gene (Christensen et al. 2006). How-
ever, more and more data points to the FOXO3A gene as the
next convincing longevity candidate gene.
In this study, we investigated the possible association of varia-
tion in the FOXO3A gene with human longevity by covering the
known common genetic variation of FOXO3A using tagging
SNPs and analyzing the frequency data both by a case­control
and by a longitudinal approach.
First, we conducted case­control analyses and found [as seen
in previous studies (Anselmi et al. 2009; Flachsbart et al. 2009;
Li et al. 2009; Pawlikowska et al. 2009; Willcox et al. 2008)]
that the frequencies of the rare alleles and rare genotypes
tended to be increased in the oldest old when compared to the
younger controls (see Supporting information Table S1). One
exception was the rs13220810 where the most frequent allele
and most frequent genotype were increased in the oldest old.
This was also observed by Flachsbart et al. (2009). Moreover, as

reported by Flachsbart et al., we found that the allele and geno-
type frequencies for the nonagenarians in our cohort were gen-
erally in between the frequencies for the younger controls and
for the centenarians, supporting the reported increase in allele
and genotype frequencies with age.
When conducting association studies by comparing allele fre-
quencies between the younger controls and oldest old, we
found nominally significantly differences between the oldest old
males and male controls for five SNPs (rs12206094,
rs13220810, rs2802292, rs3800231, and rs9486902) and one
SNP (rs479744) was significantly different between centenarians
and controls when analyzing both genders combined (see
Table 1 and Supporting information Table S2). Of these six
SNPs, all except rs12206094, rs13220210 and rs9486902 have
been found to be associated with longevity at the allele level
(after correction of multiple testing) in at least one previous
study (Anselmi et al. 2009; Flachsbart et al. 2009; Li et al. 2009;
Pawlikowska et al. 2009; Willcox et al. 2008). rs12206094 and
rs948602 have to our knowledge not been reported before,
whereas rs13220210 has been found to be nominally associated
(Flachsbart et al. 2009). The associations of the SNPs point in
the same direction as in previously published studies (the SNPs
show an increase in frequency of the rare allele in old age,
except rs13220810 where the most frequent allele was
increased in the oldest old (see Supporting information
Table S1)) supporting the findings. The associations with respect
to allele frequencies did in our study, however, not hold after
correction for multiple testing (see Supporting information
Table S3). The fact that at the allelic level, our data does not
hold for the correction of multiple testing might simply be a
matter of sample size and hence lack of power to detect an
association. However, our sample size is at least as large as the
previously published studies. Moreover, as seen below, assum-
ing a recessive model for the genotype frequency data generally
gives the lowest PGGC values, indicating that the association
effect is most pronounced for the rare homozygote individuals,
and hence that the association effect might be `masked' when
analyzing the allele frequencies (that is the heterozygotes might
`dilute' the effect).
When comparing genotype frequencies, all SNPs except
rs10499051, rs12212067, and rs12207868 were found to be
nominally significantly associated with longevity (rs3800232
was significant only for the centenarians), see Supporting infor-
mation Tables S2 and Table 1. Nine of these 12 SNPs (excluding
rs12206094, rs13220810, and rs3800232), or SNPs reported to
be in pronounced LD at these SNPs, have previously been
reported to be associated at the genotype level in at least one
study (Anselmi et al. 2009; Flachsbart et al. 2009; Pawlikowska
et al. 2009; Willcox et al. 2008).
After correction for multiple testing (see Supporting informa-
tion Table S3 and Table 2), 8 of the 12 SNPs remained signifi-
cant; two for both genders combined (rs479744 and
rs7762395) and eight when analyzing males separately
(rs12206094, rs13220810, rs13217795, rs2764264, rs479744,
rs7762395, rs9486902, and rs9400239). Four of them
(rs13217795, rs2764264, rs479744, and rs9400239) have
previously been reported to be associated (after correction for
multiple testing) in at least one study (Flachsbart et al. 2009;
Willcox et al. 2008), whereas three SNPs (rs13220810,
7762395, rs9486902) have been shown to be nominally signif-
icant (Flachsbart et al. 2009; Pawlikowska et al. 2009). For all
these SNPs (except rs13220810), the recessive model shows
the lowest PGGC values, indicating that the association effects
may be most pronounced for the rare homozygotes, possibly
giving these individuals a survival advantage. The rs13220810,
on the other hand, shows significance only when applying the
dominant model, indicating that the positive effect of this SNP
is most pronounced for individuals holding the common allele.
Flachsbart et al. (2009) and Li et al. (2009) reported signifi-
cant findings in the populations composed of both genders.
However, as seen in Table 1, 2, and 3, the differences in allele,
genotype and haplotype frequencies in our cohorts were found
to be most pronounced for males. The first study published on
the association of SNPs in FOXO3A (Willcox et al. 2008) was
conducted on an all male population and, moreover, five of six
SNPs reported by Anselmi et al. (2009) were specific for males,
whereas only one was specific for females, indicating a gender
effect. Moreover, adding further support to a male-specific
association in the case­control study we observe no associations
in females even though the sample size is larger for females than
for males (about 2.5-fold).
In addition to investigating differences in allele and genotype
frequencies, we also investigated the possible haplotypes in
FOXO3A. Again, we find that the effect is almost restricted to
males (see Table 3 and Supporting information Table S4), and
only for the TAC and CAC haplotypes of window 1 (composed
by rs9486902, rs10499051, and rs12206094). The rs9486902
and rs12206094 were (as already described) found to be associ-
ated at the genotype frequency level, so the observation that
the haplotypes including these two SNPs are found to be associ-
ated with longevity does not seem surprising.
Considering previous reporting (Flachsbart et al. 2009) of a
most significant effect in centenarians, we analyzed the cente-
narians separately. We were, however, not able to replicate
this finding; that is, we did not find additional SNPs to be asso-
ciated with longevity or an increased effect of the SNPs in the
centenarians (compared to the controls) as when comparing
the entire group of oldest old to the controls. The SNP found
to be associated in both genders in the entire group of oldest
old (rs7762395) was replicated in the centenarians; however,
only one (rs2764264) of the eight SNPs found in the males of
the entire group of oldest old was replicated in the centenari-
ans. The reason for the latter is probably the low sample size
of male centenarians (N = 30) and hence lack of power to
detect associations.
Finally, studies published so far on the association of
FOXO3A SNPs with longevity have been case­control carried
out by comparing the group of oldest old to a younger control
group. To further investigate the association of FOXO3A SNPs
with extreme survival, we investigated the 15 SNPs using longi-
FOXO3A SNPs are associated with human longevity, M. Soerensen et al.

tudinal survival data for our homogenous cohort of oldest old.
If fulfilling the proportional hazard assumptions, the Cox pro-
portional hazard model was applied. Three SNPs were found
to be nominally associated with longevity: rs10499051 in
females and in both genders combined and rs7762395 and
rs9486902 in males.
rs10499051 was not found to be significant in the case-con-
trol study. For rs7762395 and rs9486902, an increase in the rare
genotype from middle age to old age was observed in the case­
control study, which seems contradictory to the survival disad-
vantage during old age. The latter might, however, be explained
by antagonistic pleiotropy, i.e., the two SNPs might have a posi-
tive effect on survival from middle age until old age, yet a nega-
tive effect during old age. However, none of these three SNPs
hold significance after correction for multiple testing (via Bonfer-
roni); hence, it might simply be chance findings and, hence, we
cannot conclude of an association based on the longitudinal
data.
In this study, we replicated some of the previous findings
regarding an association of variation in the FOXO3A gene with
human longevity using a case­control approach and, moreover,
found novel SNPs to be associated. In addition, we report of a
longitudinal analysis, which did, however, not show results hold-
ing for the correction of multiple testing. Hence, our findings
add further evidence to the role of FOXO3A as a longevity candi-
date gene from younger ages to old age, yet not during old age.
Experimental procedures
Subjects
The oldest old individuals of our study (N = 1089) were partici-
pants in The Danish 1905 Cohort Study, which includes all
Danes born in 1905 (Nybo et al. 2001). The cohort members
were assessed for the first time in 1998, when they were
92­93 years of age. Survivors were subsequently assessed every
second year through 2005, and vital status followed until Janu-
ary 1st 2010 or until death, whichever came first, resulting in a
mean follow-up time for the survivors of 11.4 years (range:
11.2­11.6). Information on survival status was retrieved from
the Danish Central Population Register, which is continuously
updated (Pedersen et al. 2006). The younger control group
(N = 736) of this study was randomly selected from the Study of
Middle-Aged Danish Twins (Skytthe et al. 2002), which was ini-
tiated in 1998, when 2640 intact twin pairs from 22 consecutive
birth years (1931­1952) were randomly selected via the Danish
Central Person Registry. The participants have been followed
longitudinally through different registers (including Statistics
Denmark). The control group in the study presented here
includes only one twin from each twin pair. Of the 736 individu-
als, 35 had died since the beginning of the survey in 1998, and
only approximately 9% of the 736 individuals are expected to
turn 93 years of age (this estimate is based on period life table
data for the Danish population (http://www.mortality.org)). One
potential confounder in association studies is population stratifi-
cation, however, because of minimal immigration into both
these cohorts, the cohorts must be considered to be genetically
homogenous and population stratification to be minimal.
In the case­control part of the study presented here, we inves-
tigate the association of FOXO3A SNPs in the controls when
compared to the entire group of oldest old (N = 1089), as well
as of those individuals from the 1905 cohort who became cente-
narians (N = 143). The reason for doing so is that the association
of FOXO3A SNPs with longevity has previously been reported to
be most pronounced for centenarians (Flachsbart et al. 2009).
Both surveys included multidimensional face-to-face inter-
views, assessment of functional and cognitive abilities and DNA
sampling. Permission to collect blood samples and usage of reg-
ister-based information was granted by The Danish National
Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics.
Selection of chromosome region and tagging SNPs
The genomic region investigated in this study is position
108,982,719­109,113,664 of chromosome 6, which corre-
sponds to FOXO3A and 5000 base pair (bp) upstream and
1000 bp down stream (NCBI assemble 36). Data about variation
in this gene region were obtained through the HapMap consor-
tium database (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/index.html.en)
for the CEPH (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and
western Europe (CEPH) (CEU)) cohort, using the HapMap Data
Rel 23a / phase II Mar08, on NCBI B36 assembly, dbSNP b 126
criteria. Genotype SNP data were analyzed using the HaploView
software (http://www.broadinstitute.org/haploview/haploview,
Barrett et al. (2005)) to choose tagging SNPs covering 100% of
the known common genetic variation in FOXO3A (`pair wise
tagging only', R2 = 0.8, LOD = 3 and a minimum distance
between SNPs = 60 bp criteria were used). All tagging and can-
didate SNPs included in this study have a minor allele frequency
(MAF) of at least 5%.
Genotyping
DNA was isolated from blood spot samples using the QIAamp
DNA Mini and Micro Kits (Qiagen, Dusseldorf, Germany). Geno-
typing of the 15 FOXO3A SNPs was performed using the Illumina
GoldenGate platform (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) and data
cleanup was performed according to Illumina Inc's recommenda-
tions (http://www.illumina.com/documents/products/technotes/
technote_infinium_genotyping_data_analysis.pdf). Finally, 24
and 48 DNA samples were included twice in the GoldenGate
assay to investigate the intra-plate and the inter-plate reproduc-
ibility. Data showed an intra-plate reproducibility of 99.4% (using
24 samples) and an inter-plate reproducibility of 96.8% (using 48
samples).
Statistics
The Plink statistical program (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/
purcell/plink, (Purcell et al. 2007)) was used for investigating
FOXO3A SNPs are associated with human longevity, M. Soerensen et al.

genotype, allele, and haplotype frequencies in the different
groups and for association studies using v2 test statistics. P-val-
ues were obtained for allelic case­control comparison (PCCA),
for genotypic case­control comparison (PCCG), and for haplo-
typic case­control comparison (PCCH). Analysis of differences in
genotype frequencies was carried out by assuming firstly a
genotype (assumption free) model and secondly recessive and
dominant models. Haplotypes were investigated using the `Slid-
ing window' application in Plink, by setting the window at three
SNPs sliding along the 15 SNPs in the order defined by their posi-
tions on chromosome 6.
The longitudinal survival data analysis on the oldest old was
conducted by using the STATA 10.0 statistical program (Stata
Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) for estimating the
mortality risk using the Cox proportional hazard model.
A nominal significance level was set at P < 0.05, and the per-
mutation application in Plink was used for correcting for multi-
ple testing of the allele, genotype, and haplotype data (applying
max(T) permutation mode set at 1000 permutations), while for
the Cox regression analysis, a Bonferroni correction level at
P = 0.05/2.15 SNPs = 0.00166 was used.
