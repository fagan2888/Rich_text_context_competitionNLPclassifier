Serum Antioxidant Nutrients, Vitamin A, and Mortality
in U.S. Adults
Abhishek Goyal1, Mary Beth Terry1, and Abby B. Siegel2
Abstract
Background: Observational studies have suggested that antioxidant nutrients may reduce cancer and
overall mortality risks. However, most randomized trials have failed to show survival benefits. Examining
nonlinear associations between antioxidant levels and health outcomes may help to explain these discrepant
findings.
Methods: We evaluated all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular mortality risks associated with quintiles
(Q1­Q5) of serum antioxidant (vitamins C and E, b-carotene, and selenium) and vitamin A levels, in 16,008
adult participants of The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III; 1988­1994).
Results: Over a median follow-up period of 14.2 years, there were 4,225 deaths, including 891 from
cancer and 1,891 from cardiovascular disease. We observed a dose­response decrease in cancer and overall
mortality risks with higher vitamin C levels. In contrast, for vitamin A, risk of cancer death decreased from
Q1­Q2, with no further decline in risk at higher levels. For vitamin E, having levels in Q4 was associated with
the lowest cancer mortality risk. Both vitamin A and E had U-shaped associations with all-cause mortality.
Cancer mortality risks decreased from Q1­Q2 for b-carotene and from Q1­Q4 for selenium. However, for
b-carotene and selenium, overall mortality risks decreased from Q1­Q2 but then did not change significantly
with higher levels.
Conclusions: Antioxidant supplement use should be studied in the context of overall mortality and other
competing mortality risks.
Impact: These data suggest the need for novel intervention studies where doses of these agents are
individualized based on their serum levels, and possibly, markers of oxidative stress and systemic inflam-
matory response. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 22(12); 2202­11. Ó2013 AACR.
Introduction
Recent data show that between 28% and 30% of U.S.
adults use supplements containing vitamins A, C, and E,
and 18% to 19% report using selenium (1, 2). Higher
serum antioxidant levels have been associated with lower
overall mortality risk (3­15), and fruit and vegetable
intake (a rich source of antioxidants) has also been shown
to predict better health outcomes in observational studies
(16­20). In contrast, most randomized controlled trials
have either failed to show significant health benefits from
taking these supplements or reported possible harm. A
recent systematic review of 78 primary and secondary
prevention trials by the Cochrane Collaboration conclud-
ed that use of b-carotene, vitamin E, or high doses of
vitamin A supplements was associated with increased
all-cause mortality, while the role of vitamin C or seleni-
um supplementation was not clear (21). Although the
Physicians' Health Study II (22) recently showed a small
reduction in total cancer incidence with multivitamin
supplement use, most large clinical trials assessing cancer
incidence or mortality have failed to show any beneficial
effects of taking these supplements (23­29).
Many authors have suggested that the reason for these
discrepant findings is that antioxidants have different
effects on various disease processes, and that beyond
a certain "threshold" level, they can be potentially toxic
(30­40). Surprising little literature exists, however,
examining nonlinear effects between serum antioxidant
nutrient levels and all-cause and cause-specific mortality
outcomes. There are also few studies examining compet-
ing risks of mortality in the context of antioxidant nutrient
use.
Using data from The Third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES; 1988­1994), a large
nationally representative cohort of U.S. adults, we
examined whether serum levels of micronutrients with
antioxidant properties (vitamins C and E, b-carotene, and

cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality outcomes.
Furthermore, by assessing nonlinear associations, we ex-
plored some of the reasons behind the inconsistency in
findings between observational studies and randomized
trials about the role of these agents on health outcomes.
Materials and Methods
Study population
NHANES III was conducted from October 1988
through October 1994 by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) to provide national health esti-
mates of the United States' civilian population (41). The
overall sample size was 39,695; interview and examina-
tion response rates were 86% (33,974 participants) and
78% (30,818 participants), respectively (42). Follow-up
was from the date of survey participation (1988­1994)
to December 31, 2006. Of the 16,573 NHANES III parti-
cipants (ages 20 years and above) who underwent
medical examination, our study included 16,008 (97%)
participants for whom data on serum antioxidant nutri-
ent levels and vital status were available. Missing data
on covariates ranged from less than 1% to 8% of the study
participants. In the analysis, we included only those indi-
viduals with complete information available for these
covariates. NHANES III was approved by the Institution-
al Review Board at the CDC. Written informed consent
was obtained from all study participants (43).
Measures
Our primary exposures of interest were serum levels of
vitamin A, and micronutrients with antioxidant proper-
ties. Levels of vitamin A (retinol), vitamin C, vitamin E
(a-tocopherol), and b-carotene were measured by iso-
cratic high-performance liquid chromatography (44).
Serum selenium levels were measured with atomic
absorption spectrometry (44). NHANES III laboratory
procedures including quality control systems have been
described elsewhere (45).
Our primary outcomes of interest were cause-specific
and all-cause mortality. Mortality data were primarily
obtained by probabilistic matching to the National Death
Index records using the 2010 public release version of the
NHANES III Linked Mortality File (46). NHANES III also
used various other sources of information to determine
the final mortality status and causes of death for survey
participants including death certificates, Social Security
Administration data, and records from the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services. The 9th and 10th revi-
sions of the International Statistical Classification of Dis-
eases (ICD-9 and ICD-10) were used to classify deaths due
to cancer (C00-C97) and cardiovascular disease (I00-I78;
refs. 46­48). Final mortality status was determined for
more than 99% of the study participants (46).
Statistical analysis
To accommodate the complex survey design of
NHANES III, we applied appropriate statistical weights
in our analyses (42). Cox Proportional Hazards Models
were used to estimate the HRs, and the proportional-
hazards assumption was tested using the Kolmogorov-
type supremum test (49). To examine whether the asso-
ciations had a dose­response relationship, we modeled
serum levels of antioxidants as quintiles, using the first
quintile as the reference group.
Covariates used in the analysis were selected a priori
based on their suspected roles as confounders. We first
fit a basic model adjusted for age and gender (Model 1).
For multivariable analysis, Model 2 additionally included
race­ethnicity, education, income, body mass index
(BMI), smoking status, serum cotinine levels, alcohol
consumption, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity,
serum total cholesterol levels, hypertension status (sys-
tolic or diastolic blood pressure 140 or 90 mm Hg,
respectively, use of antihypertensive drugs, or hyperten-
sion medical history), diabetes mellitus status (glycosy-
lated hemoglobin 6.5%, use of antidiabetic drugs, or
diabetes medical history), history of heart attack, conges-
tive heart failure, stroke or cancer, hormone use among
women (use of any estrogen or progesterone including
oral contraceptive pills in the past one month), and use of
vitamin or mineral supplements (in the past one month).
Categories of variables used in the analysis were consis-
tent with the NHANES III survey design (42).
Additional analyses examined these associations in the
first 5 or 10 years of follow-up, after excluding deaths
within the first 3 years of the survey, and after excluding
current smokers. We also assessed the independent
effects of these agents by adjusting for other micronutri-
ents in the multivariable models. Because systemic
inflammatory response has been shown to affect plasma
micronutrient measurements, in an additional analysis,
we further adjusted for C-reactive protein levels (50).
As participants with self-reported history of comor-
bidities may have changed their dietary habits and sup-
plement usage, we conducted separate analyses after
excluding those with known history of heart attack,
congestive heart failure, stroke, or cancer. Finally, to
investigate dose­response associations using vitamin A
and antioxidant nutrient levels as continuous variables,
we created restricted cubic spline functions for all-cause,
cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality outcomes
(51). All analyses were done using SAS (Version 9.3;
SAS Institute Inc.).
Results
Of the 16,008 study participants, 4,225 died over a
median follow-up period of 14.2 years. Eight hundred
and ninety-one deaths were due to cancer and 1,891
were due to cardiovascular disease. Table 1 shows the
mean baseline serum levels subdivided by sociodemo-
graphic, lifestyle, and health-related variables. There
were significant differences in serum micronutrient
levels for different participant characteristics, especially
for BMI categories and smoking status, with current
smokers and those with BMI 30 kg/m2 having

significantly lower vitamin C and b-carotene levels.
NHANES III Analytic and Reporting Guidelines pro-
vide further details about the characteristics of the
study population (42).
Table 2 shows the HRs and 95% confidence intervals
(CI) for all-cause mortality by quintiles (Q1­Q5) of micro-
nutrient levels. Table 2 also provides the cutoff points
used for dividing serum levels into quintiles. HRs for
cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality are shown
in Table 3.
We observed U-shaped associations between serum
levels of vitamins A and E, and all-cause mortality (Fig.
1) with those with levels in Q1 or Q5 having higher
mortality risks compared with those with levels in Q2­
Q4. For vitamin A, risk of cancer death decreased from Q1
to Q2, with no further decline in risk at higher levels,
whereas for vitamin E, having levels 26.08 mmol/L (Q4­
Q5) were associated with the lowest cancer mortality risk.
The increased all-cause mortality risk for those with levels
in Q5 for vitamin A was mainly driven by higher cardio-
vascular disease mortality (Fig. 2), and for vitamin E, by
higher stroke mortality.
For vitamin C (Model 2), all-cause mortality risk
decreased with increases in serum levels from Q1 to Q4
(Ptrend
< 0.001) with no further decline in risk with higher
levels (60.19 mmol/L). For cancer mortality, we
observed a dose­response relationship between higher
levels and reduced risk (Ptrend
< 0.001). Cardiovascular
disease mortality decreased with higher vitamin C levels,
except for those with levels in Q5.
For b-carotene and selenium, there was a significant
decrease in the overall mortality risk from Q1 to Q2 (HR
for Q2 vs. Q1 for b-carotene: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61­0.93;
for selenium: 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63­0.87); however, higher
levels (0.15 mmol/L for b-carotene; 1.40 nmol/L for
selenium) did not significantly change the risk. Cancer
mortality risks decreased from Q1 to Q2 for b-carotene
and from Q1 to Q4 for selenium. Beyond Q1, higher levels
seemed to increase the cardiovascular disease mortality
risk for both b-carotene and selenium.

Discussion
Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogen-
esis of several chronic diseases, including various cancers
(52­55). Vitamin A and antioxidant nutrients such as
vitamins C and E, b-carotene, and selenium have been
hypothesized to prevent or delay this damage (56­61).
Consequently, use of these agents is rising, and almost
40% of U.S. adults take them for their perceived health
benefits (1, 2).
In this study, using data from a large, nationally rep-
resentative cohort of 16,008 U.S. adults, we observed
threshold effects and nonlinear associations between
serum levels of these micronutrients, and all-cause and
cause-specific mortality outcomes. These results help to
explain some of the discrepant findings between the
observational studies and randomized trials about the
role of these agents on health outcomes.
We found that higher levels were generally associated
with a modest decrease in all-cancer mortality risk. How-
ever, the most significant decline in risk was generally
from the first to the second quintile. A number of high
profile trials assessing antioxidants as cancer prevention
agents have failed to show significant mortality benefits
with taking these supplements (23­27) and some have
reported possible harm (28, 29). A recent meta-analysis of
22 primary and secondary prevention trials concluded
that there was no evidence to support preventive effects of
any of the antioxidant supplements on any cancer type

(62). The Physicians' Health Study II also recently showed
only a small reduction in total cancer incidence (HR ¼
0.92; 95% CI, 0.86­0.998) and a nonsignificant reduction
in mortality (HR ¼ 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77­1.01) with more
than a decade of daily multivitamin use and follow-up
(22). Furthermore, most of these large prevention trials
did not consider baseline nutrition level in their inclusion
criteria (63, 64).
The importance of assessing baseline nutritional status
is underscored by the Linxian Study in China, which
specifically targeted a geographic area where subjects had
chronically low blood levels of multiple micronutrients. It
is the only prevention trial to our knowledge so far that
has reported statistically significant reductions in all-can-
cer (RR ¼ 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75­1.00) as well as overall
mortality (RR ¼ 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84­0.99) risks with anti-
oxidant supplementation (65).
Interestingly, in the Physicians' Health Study I, there
was no decrease in total cancer incidence with b-carotene
supplementation. However, in subgroup analyses, lower
baseline b-carotene levels were associated with alcohol
consumption and higher BMI, and overall cancer inci-
dence was modestly reduced with supplementation in
these subgroups (among daily alcohol drinkers, RR ¼ 0.9;
95% CI, 0.8­1.0; among those in the highest BMI quartile,
RR ¼ 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7­1.0; ref. 23). Similarly, in the SU.VI.
MAX trial, lower total cancer incidence (RR ¼ 0.69;95% CI,
0.53­0.91) and all-cause mortality (RR ¼ 0.63; 95% CI,
0.42­0.93) with multivitamin use in men was attributable
to their lower baseline antioxidant status (27). Although
some of these results could be due to testing multiple
hypotheses, the findings presented in our study as well as
the results from others examining a nutritionally deficient
population further support the hypothesis that supple-
mentation might only be useful for those who have low
serum antioxidant levels, and that beyond a threshold,
higher levels do not lead to additional benefit, and may
potentially be toxic.
Our results also have broader implications for assessing
overall mortality benefits from the use of dietary supple-
ments. For example, using antioxidant levels as continu-
ous variables, a study in the British National Diet and
Nutrition Survey found that higher levels of vitamin C,
selenium, and b-carotene were associated with lower
overall mortality risk (HR per SD for vitamin C ¼ 0.81,
P < 0.001; for selenium ¼ 0.76, P < 0.001; and for b-carotene
¼ 0.92, P ¼ 0.08), whereas the results for vitamins A and E
were not significant (HR for vitamin A ¼ 0.96, P ¼ 0.4;
a-tocopherol ¼ 0.96, P ¼ 0.4; ref. 6). If we had used
antioxidant levels as continuous variables, we would have
obtained similar results. However, by assessing nonlinear
associations, we were able to show that for selenium and
b-carotene, beyond the first quintile, there was no appar-
ent decrease in the mortality risk with higher levels (Fig.
1). Moreover, we showed a U-shaped association between
levels of vitamins A and E, and all-cause mortality.
These results for overall mortality are also consistent
with the findings of the recent systematic review by the
Cochrane Collaboration, which concluded that supple-
mentation with b-carotene, vitamin E, or high doses of
vitamin A was associated with increased mortality risk,
whereas the role of vitamin C or selenium supplement
use was not clear (21). Figure 1 in our study shows that
except for vitamin C, having antioxidant levels beyond
the first quintile did not lead to any further decrease in
all-cause mortality risk. Moreover, for vitamins A and E,
higher levels increased the overall risk of death.
Our study has a number of strengths compared with
previous studies. First, this is the largest study to date
assessing serum vitamin A and antioxidant nutrient
levels, and cause-specific and all-cause mortality out-
comes. Therefore, instead of examining serum levels as
continuous variables, we were able to divide them into
quintiles, and assess threshold and nonlinear relation-
ships with mortality. Because of small sample sizes
and/or short follow-up durations, most observational
studies have been unable to show such associations (3­
15). Furthermore, NHANES III used a nationally repre-
sentative sample of the U.S. population, and final mor-
tality status was available for more than 99% of the
participants, minimizing the possibility of selection bias.
Assessing serum levels of these agents instead of using
dietary history, along with standardized and validated
laboratory methods, reduced the potential for information
bias. Finally, use of appropriate sampling weights in the
analysis helped to obtain statistical estimates similar to
those if the entire sampling frame (the United States) had
been surveyed.
Our study has several limitations. We tested multiple
hypotheses. Therefore, results must be interpreted with
caution. We limited our analysis to vitamin A and anti-
oxidant nutrients that are commonly used as dietary
supplements. Other potential agents with antioxidant
properties such as zinc, lycopene, and other carotenoids
need further evaluation. As with any observational study,
residual confounding by socioeconomic status, lifestyle
variables, and other factors cannot be excluded. However,
NHANES III assessed a large number of health-related
variables, which enabled us to control for many potential
confounders. Furthermore, we obtained different results
for different micronutrients as well as for different health
outcomes. These findings would be difficult to explain
entirely on the basis of residual confounding. In addition
to assessing cardiovascular mortality, there are many
other possible competing risks for mortality that we could
have assessed. We assessed cardiovascular mortality as an
example of potential different effects of antioxidants on
different disease processes.
Finally, in this study, we used a single measurement of
serum levels to assess long-term nutritional status. In
our analysis (Supplementary Table S6), we observed sim-
ilar HRs for 5-year, 10-year, and for the entire duration
of follow-up. This suggests that at the population level,
a single measurement of serum levels may provide
a reliable estimate of long-term antioxidant status. A
major limitation of randomized trials assessing use of

supplements for primary prevention is that the partici-
pants typically have to be kept on intervention for long
periods to significantly affect health outcomes. Therefore,
observational studies such as this mayfacilitate the assess-
ment of the relationship between long-term nutritional
status and health outcomes.
In summary, using data from a nationally representa-
tive cohort of more than 16,000 U.S. adults, we were able to
identify specific plasma levels of vitamin A and various
antioxidant nutrients, which were associated with max-
imum cancer-related and overall survival. We found that
beyond a certain threshold, there was generally no addi-
tional benefit with higher serum levels with respect
to overall mortality. Specifically, for vitamins A and E,
higher levels increased the overall mortality risk. These
data support the findings of recent randomized trials
that have generally failed to show health benefits with
taking these supplements (21, 62, 66). We also showed
that having low serum antioxidant nutrient levels was
associated with higher mortality risk, suggesting that
supplementation might still be useful for those who are
nutritionally deficient.
Our findings underscore the need to assess safety of
these agents like other drugs, rather than classifying them
as "dietary supplements," which affects their regulatory
oversight (67). Although the current Institute of Medicine
guidelines provide recommended dietary allowances and
tolerable upper intake levels for these agents, we also
highlight the potential significance of measuring serum
levels to guide their use as supplements (68). Novel
intervention studies might then be planned where doses
of these agents are individualized on the basis of serum
levels, lifestyle behaviors such as smoking which affect
levels, and possibly, markers of oxidative stress and
systemic inflammatory response (50, 69, 70). Such a strat-
egy would help ensure that those who are deficient get the
required micronutrients, while also preventing toxic
levels of antioxidants that could potentially lead to worse
health outcomes.
