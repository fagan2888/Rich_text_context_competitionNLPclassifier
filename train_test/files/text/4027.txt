Abstract: The field of psychology remains a divided one. Several different sub-disciplines
(e.g., developmental, cognitive, behaviorism, social, etc.) form what could be a unified
scientific area. However, there is no widely accepted theory of unification. Charles Darwin
once theorized that evolutionary theory would change the foundation of psychology; but
over the years, evolutionary psychology has been met with hostile resistance from some of
the prominent psychologists within the other sub-disciplines. Yet in recent years, all of the
divided sub-disciplines of psychology have been slowly implementing evolutionary
principles into their literature and research. This slow integration of evolutionary
psychology into the other sub-disciplines indicates the possibility of a unified psychology
with evolution as its foundation. This paper briefly reviews the literature within each major
sub-discipline of psychology to show their implementation of evolutionary psychological
theories, indicating the possibility of evolutionary psychology becoming the unifying
paradigm upon which the entire field of psychology can be based. A call for action to
continue this process is also discussed.
Keywords: Evolutionary psychology, sub-disciplines, consilience, acceptance, resistance.

Introduction
Last year marked the 150th anniversary of one of the most profound and influential
scientific discoveries in human history--Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural
selection. In its infancy, Darwin's work was a hotbed of controversy with liberal and
progressive intellectuals climbing on board almost instantly and many conservative
evangelicals launching their strongest counter campaigns. A century and a half later, and
with a mountain of supporting data, evolution is still contested within the scientific
community.
In the closing pages of his monumental text, On the Origin of Species by Means of
Natural Selection (1859), Darwin offered a glimpse of his dream for the future: "In the
Acceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology

distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based
on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity
by gradation" (p. 449).
The distant future to which Darwin envisioned is finally upon us. The relatively
new field of evolutionary psychology is beginning to change the way psychologists study
the human mind and is allowing psychologists to look at human behavior in exciting new
ways. However, with progress comes opposition and this field is no exception. Unlike the
biological sciences, evolutionary theory has not enjoyed the warm reception for which
Darwin might have hoped. Psychology as a whole is yet to accept Darwin's theory as the
foundation of scientific inquiry, but at the very least evolutionary psychologists finally
have a seat at the table.
David Buss (1995a, 1995b) once wrote about the questionable future of
evolutionary psychology. Although his tone was one of hopeful optimism, Buss's words
were describing a newborn paradigm in the midst of the field of psychology--a field that
has been characterized by disarray. However, this budding model known as evolutionary
psychology was also in the dawn of psychological breakthroughs and new empirical
methods. It has now been over 150 years after Darwin's historic discovery, so let us once
again briefly examine the future of a psychology based on evolutionary principles.
Evolutionary Psychology Today
Despite a measure of evolutionary acceptance and multiple calls for unity, the field
of psychology remains highly segregated. A number of commentators have highlighted the
many problems associated with this fragmentation and have offered theories to aid in a
rectifying integration (Goertzen, 2008; Henriques, 2003, 2008; Koch, 1993; Saad, 2007,
2008; Wilson, 1998). These problems, all of which have arisen from philosophical conflict
between the divided sub-disciplines of psychology (Goertzen, 2008), include differences in
methodological approaches, theoretical approaches, conceptual assumptions and
interpretations, as well as a general lack of unity in subject matter (Henriques, 2003, 2008).
Until psychology is united upon a common theoretical framework, it will continue to suffer
from these problems.
The same specific areas that Buss (1995a, 1995b) discussed (cognitive,
developmental, and social), along with other areas, including biological psychology,
clinical psychology, and behaviorism, are still independent of each other. However,
evolutionary psychology is beginning to show promise as the unifying paradigm upon
which all of these different sub-disciplines of psychology can eventually merge, creating an
amalgamation that results in a single organized theory that is focused on the research of
human and animal behavior. While the chances of a field-wide adoption of evolutionary
principles in the very near future is rather slim, a closer look reveals evidence that the
process of integrating evolutionary principles has begun in every major sub-discipline of
psychology.
Cognitive Psychology
The cognitive revolution of the 1960's acted as a counterbalance to the radical
behaviorism that dominated psychology for the first half of the twentieth century.
Psychologists and philosophers began to realize that they could not talk about human
Acceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology

behavior without discussing human beliefs and desires--products of the human mind, a
concept that had been off limits throughout the behaviorist movement. As a result, the mind
was once again fair game for scientific study. The development of the computer and ground
breaking work in artificial intelligence offered a new testing ground to support the notion of
mental processes and would ultimately refute some of the long held tenets of behaviorism
(Evans and Zarate, 1999). In response to the waning reputation of the field of psychology
and its nomenclature, researchers such as Noam Chomsky (1957) and George Miller (1951)
began to call their new line of research "cognitive science" (see Miller (2003) for a
historical review).
The new approach to cognition brought with it a renewed interest in the biological
underpinnings of thought and psychological behavior. Researchers such as David Marr
(1982) began to theorize that cognition must require a great deal of processing within the
brain and ethologists such as E.O Wilson (1975) hypothesized that this processing is
determined by our mental architecture and, as such, is and has always been subject to the
pressures of evolution. Ultimately, some cognitive scientists adopted biological
methodology to mapping the functionality of the brain and thus cognitive neuroscience was
born.
Finally, a full integration of biological approaches and cognitive science has
emerged in the form of an evolutionary cognitive neuroscience. In its simplest form,
evolutionary cognitive neuroscience is the merging of the fields of evolutionary psychology
and cognitive neuroscience using methodology from both disciplines and guidance from
evolutionary meta-theory (Krill, Platek, Goetz, and Shackelford, 2007). With these new
approaches to the study of human thought and behavior as well as an ever increasing
interest in evolutionary biology, a new synthesis has been created (Wilson, 1975) and has
ultimately led to the development of evolutionary psychology.
Although determining the development of cognitive abilities over evolutionary
history has been a daunting task, scientific theories and supporting evidence have been
rising. For instance, evolutionary theories on the acquisition of memory (Klein, Cosmides,
and Tooby, 2002) have developed as well as primate studies supporting an evolution of
social cognition (Byrne and Whiten, 1992). In fact, Steven Platek and colleagues' recent
work in evolutionary cognitive neuroscience has shed light onto many evolutionary
principles, including perceptions of facial resemblance, paternity uncertainty, and physical
attraction. Using fMRI technology, these researchers have found that men and women
perceive facial similarity between themselves and children relatively equally; however,
men react and invest more favorably in children that resemble them than women do ­
supporting the evolutionary theory that men do not want to waste resources on children that
may not be theirs (as indicated by physical similarity) (Platek et al, 2004). Using fMRI
technology has also shown that viewing attractive women activates the reward centers in
the brain ­ and the women perceived as attractive always had the standard .70 waist-to-hip
ratio ­ which is highly correlated with female reproductive success (Platek and Singh,
2010).
Since cognitive psychology's main focus is on internal mechanisms rather than
environmental factors, evolutionary psychology has had a little easier transition into this
area than others, but that is not to say that evolutionary psychology has been completely
accepted within the realm of cognitive psychology (For more information on this
integration, see Todd, Hertwig, and Hoffrage, 2005).

Developmental Psychology
In the early to middle of the 20th century, researchers such as Gesell (1928) and
Piaget (1955) brought forth the expansion of developmental psychology. These
psychologists were some of the first to find support for theories reflecting the biologically
predetermined cognitive development of humans (Parke and Clarke-Stewart, 2003). Since
nature and nurture both play a role in human development, empirical methods in
developmental psychology, such as monozygotic twin studies, have allowed behavioral
genetics to explain human development as well (see Segal and Hill (2005) for a full
review).
Evolutionary psychology has been able to mingle with behavioral genetics in the
area of human development--creating theoretical explanations for the empirical data that
behavioral geneticists have found (Mealey, 2001). With evolutionary theories and research
combining with genetics data, developmental psychologists have begun to recognize many
evolutionary theories as relevant to developmental psychology (Bjorklund and Ellis, 2005).
Evolutionary theories have been incorporated into most, if not all, aspects of human
development, including pregnancy (Flaxman and Sherman, 2000), child development
(Bjorklund and Ellis, 2005), and puberty and adolescence (Ellis, 2005; Weisfeld and
Janisse, 2005). Evolutionary theories on seemingly harmful phenomena that occur during
human development, such as pregnancy sickness (Flaxman and Sherman, 2000) and the
slow maturation rate of humans when compared to other primates (Dunbar, 1992), have
become accepted as beneficial evolved mechanisms. This is the beginning of an
incorporation of evolutionary principles into developmental psychology.
Social Psychology
Social psychology has been prominent since the late 19th century with the
publications of William James' The Principles of Psychology in 1890 and James Baldwin's
Social and Ethical Interpretations in Mental Development: A Study in Social Psychology in
1897. These texts spawned theories with a focus on relating psychological events to social
interaction (Morawski and Bayer, 2003). With a century of developing theories and
empirical progress, social psychologists have argued that one's environment (i.e.,
interaction with others) influences internal psychological phenomena and is therefore the
foundation for social behavior.
Evolutionary psychologists have been working diligently to show that natural and
sexual selection are the underpinnings of social behavior. Current evolutionary theories on
human interaction, including altruism (Hamilton, 1964; Trivers, 1971), sexual attraction
(Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Darwin, 1871), and aggression (Buss and Duntley, 2006; Daly
and Wilson, 1988) have gained scientific support and respect, slowly inching their way into
social psychology. In fact, social behavior in non-human primate studies have been
showing striking similarities to social behavior in humans. For instance, chimpanzees are
the only other species besides humans that are known to partake in warfare ­ defined as
coalitional aggression consisting of groups of larger than four members (although evidence
suggests the possibility that dolphins may also belong in this group) (Tooby and Cosmides,
1988; Wrangham and Peterson, 1996).
The current relationship between evolutionary and social psychology shows hints of
promise toward cooperation between the two fields. Although evolutionary psychology has
Acceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 8(2): 2010. -288-
been met with severe opposition from social psychologists, Kenrick, Maner, and Li (2005)
found an increasing number of social psychology textbooks have been incorporating
evolutionary psychology, albeit with greater scrutiny and criticism toward evolutionary
psychology's theories and methods than toward social psychology's theories and methods.
Evolutionary psychologists' empirical findings pertaining to many social phenomena, such
as kin relations (Anderson, Kaplan, and Lancaster, 1999; Burnstein, Crandall, and
Kitayama, 1994), group identification (Henrich and Boyd, 1998), and culture (Boyd and
Richerson, 2005) indicate a possibility of future acceptance between evolutionary
psychology and social psychology.
Evolutionary principles are also being incorporated into many social behaviors ­
and not strictly in an academic setting. David Buss's (1994) book The Evolution of Desire
discussed the evolutionary basis for mating behavior in humans ­ from dating to sex to
marriage and infidelity. But over the past few years, many popular books related to pickup
artists have been incorporating the principles that Buss (1994) described into successful
dating strategies. Books such as Neil Strauss's (2005) The Game: Penetrating the Secret
Society of Pickup Artists, as well as several others, have opened many people's eyes to the
use of gaining women's attention through the activation of many evolutionary principles of
attraction. These principles include demonstrating high social status, displaying a large
amount of resources, and maintaining a healthy physical image (as an unhealthy one is
associated with disease and sickness). As evolutionary research shows, these behaviors are
often characteristic of the dominant alpha male of hunter-gatherer tribes and even
chimpanzees (Buss, 1989; De Waal, 1982). These pickup artists also delve into the
behavior necessary for successfully approaching and dating women by using social
behaviors that we developed in our hunter-gatherer ancestry. Thus, we can see that not only
is evolutionary psychology being incorporated into social psychological theories, it is also
being used in the actual social world. However, social psychologists still seem to view
evolutionary psychology with reluctance and criticism (Kenrick et al., 2005).
Biological Psychology
Psychologists have been linking the brain to behavior for generations (see
Thompson and Zola (2003) for a full history). However, the technological advancements of
the 20th century (e.g., the electron microscope, fMRI machines, etc.) have helped biological
psychology develop rapidly. Studying patients with brain damage and/or neurological
disorders has brought about mounds of undeniable evidence linking specific behaviors to
neurotransmitter release in specific brain structures.
Since the inception of the Human Genome Project in 1990, biological psychology
has begun adopting evolutionary principles quite rapidly. Because behavior is often linked
to the release of specific neurotransmitters, revealing that certain genes are responsible for
these neurotransmitters (e.g., which neurotransmitters are released, how much is released,
how often they are released, etc.) has allowed for the integration of evolutionary theory into
biological research.
In recent years, genetic research has linked multiple genes to specific behaviors and
some disorders (e.g., Huntington's disease (MacDonald et al., 1993), further fueling
evolutionary psychology's incorporation into biological psychology. In fact, recent
research has found a gene that is responsible for modulating the amount of vasopressin
released in the brain, which is linked to monogamous behavior (Walum et al., 2008).
Acceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology

Ultimately, the relationship between evolutionary psychology and biological psychology is
rapidly growing in acceptance.
Clinical Psychology
Clinical psychology has maintained a central focus on the etiology and treatment of
mental illness (see Routh and Reisman (2003) for a full history). Connecting mental illness
to physiological abnormalities within the brain has facilitated the invention of treatments
for many psychological disorders, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for
depression, methylphenidate for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and
atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia. However, the definitive causes to most
psychological disorders remain undetermined. Since mental illness has a physiological
basis, is heritable, and is prevalent across cultures, evolutionary psychological theories may
be necessary to discover these unknown causes.
Evolutionary approaches to clinical psychology have brought about several theories
pertaining to the onset of mental disorders (see Nesse (2005a) for a full review). Many of
these disorders may have been positively selected, including ADHD (Baird, Stevenson, and
Williams, 2000; Jensen et al., 1997), depression (Hamburg, Hamburg, and Barchas, 1975;
Watson and Andrews, 2002), and eating disorders (Buss, 1988, 1994). However, disorders
like schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder, which only have a 1% rate of
incidence, are met with many theories (Byrne, Agerbo, Ewald, and Eaton, 2003; Malaspina
et al., 2002; Swedo, Leonard, Garvey, and Mittleman, 2004), only a few of which argue
from an evolutionary perspective (Crow, 1997; Nesse, 2005b; Rapoport and Fiske, 1998).
Because evolutionary psychologists have not discovered a new treatment for any
mental disorder, clinicians have been reluctant to accept evolutionary psychology as an
underlying paradigm (Nesse, 2005a). Research into the evolutionary etiology of mental
disorders has been promising but conflicting as well. Perhaps more collaborative ventures
between clinical and evolutionary psychologists could yield some interesting and beneficial
outcomes, such as the discovery of direct causes, or new cures, of mental disorders.
However, until that point is reached clinical psychologists will continue to disregard
evolutionary psychology as a legitimate framework for clinical psychology (Nesse, 2005a).
Behaviorism
As every introductory psychology text shows, the behaviorism movement began
around the turn of the 20th century with Pavlov's classical conditioning. Throughout the
1900s behaviorism progressed from the strict classical conditioning of John Watson to B.F.
Skinner's radical behaviorism, which accepted the ideas of private events within the
organism but still focused on the manipulation of one's environment. Radical behaviorism
has arguably brought about the birth of modern behavior analysis, which is still a thriving
area of study today.
Even though behaviorism is centered on how one's environment can influence
behavior, the fact that behaviorists are studying behavior in animals (e.g., rats and pigeons)
and generalizing their findings to other species, especially humans, is ripe with
evolutionary theory. Since all creatures share common ancestry, albeit in some instances it
is extremely distant, we all tend to have certain features that are similar, such as the more
primitive parts of the central nervous system. Because humans share a common ancestry
with other species, many behavioral findings are generalizable across species, which
Acceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 8(2): 2010. -290-
explains why medicinal drug testing begins with animals before being approved for human
clinical trials. Even the great behaviorist B.F. Skinner (1986) admitted to evolution playing
a role in behavior, so it would seem as though behaviorists are on the track toward
incorporating evolutionary psychology into their theories and experimental methods.
Currently, behavior analysis is performed on rats and generalized to human
behavior quite extensively. These areas include the relationships between brain structures
and taste and odor aversion (Lasiter, Deems, and Garcia, 1985), fear and anxiety responses
(Chen, Rainnie, Greene, and Tonegawa, 1994; Kudo et al., 2007), as well as symptoms of
psychological disorders such as addiction (Nestler, 2000, 2001) and ADHD (Sagvolden,
Russell, Aase, Johansen, and Farshbaf, 2005; Hand, Fox, and Reilly, 2006; Fox, Hand, and
Reilly, 2008) to name a few. The between-species generalization occurring in these works,
as well as many others, implies a blossoming relationship between evolutionary
psychology and behaviorism.
A Call for Continued Action
As the research shows, these sub-disciplines are beginning to show signs of
adopting evolutionary psychology as their theoretical foundation. Along with landmark
publications such as The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology (Buss, 2005) and The
Adapted Mind (Barkow, Tooby and Cosmides, 1992), evolutionary psychology has begun
to develop into a paradigm that can be applied to any sub-discipline of psychology. In other
words, the sub-disciplines of psychology are becoming evolutionized (Bjorklund and Blasi,
2005; Kenrick et al., 2005; Todd, Hertwig, and Huffrage, 2005). As such, "we now have an
evolutionary social psychology, evolutionary developmental psychology, and now an
evolutionary cognitive neuroscience" (Cosmides and Tooby, 1995, p. 1199).
For as long as psychology has been in existence, attempts have been made to unify
the knowledge within it. Most recently, evolutionary psychologists have made a concerted
effort to unify the field into an "increasingly seamless system of interconnected
knowledge" (Tooby and Cosmides, 1992, p. 19). However, despite a great deal of support
for the unification of psychology, dissenters have voiced their opinions rather stridently
(Gergen, 1988, Derksen, 2005; Schlinger, 1996). For instance, Schlinger (1996) has
attempted to argue that evolutionary psychology functions on the basis of "just-so" stories.
More specifically, he argues that evolutionary psychologists base conclusions simply on
viewing anecdotal evidence from humans and other animals. The arguments against the use
of evolutionary principles, however, seem to miss the point. As Holcomb (1996) pointed
out, "just-so" stories are merely accusations rooted in confusion over evolution and
experimentation.
Although other dissenters may not attack the foundation of evolutionary psychology
itself, they take aim at the argument for consilience of psychology on evolutionary
principles. As Derksen (2005) has argued, the disunity in psychology reflects the diversity
of human development and interactions across the world. Having multiple sub-disciplines
allows psychologists to specialize in a specific area of that diversity. Psychologists are then
able to interact with other psychologists to reflect on this diversity in human behavior. To
create a completely unified psychology may result in the loss of this diversity and has thus
been characterized as "wrongheaded" (Derksen, 2005, p. 158).
To unify the field of psychology with seamless boundaries is not the reason
evolutionary psychology should be the overarching scheme as Derksen (2005) and others
Acceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 8(2): 2010. -291-
would have psychologists believe. Evolutionary psychology should be a unifying factor
merely as a by-product of its actual function--to simplify and explain the functional origins
of a large number of human psychological processes. In short, it should be accepted as a
dominant theory or perhaps the meta-theory because human cognition, culture, and
behavior cannot be disconnected from human biology. Thus, an evolutionary approach is
paramount to a complete understanding of psychological processes. However, it would be
irresponsible and incorrect to suggest that evolutionary psychology would or should create
a completely homogenous integration of disciplines. To do so would imply that a future
psychology would only be an evolutionary psychology with all other sub-disciplines
absorbed within it. The reality of an evolutionary psychology meta-theory, in our view, is a
set of more completely informed sub-disciplines with evolutionary theory serving as a
powerful paradigm. However, in the absence of a model in which to follow, there is
potential for further segregation as disagreements over the role of the paradigm in each sub-
discipline are likely.
This may sound bleak; but as the literature shows, evolutionary psychology is
slowly inching its way into each of psychology's sub-disciplines. However, evolutionary
psychologists must remain aware of this integration process because it is still being met
with severe resistance from many researchers in most, if not all, sub-disciplines. There are
countless benefits that could be gained through the consilience of psychology (Goertzen,
2008; Henriques, 2003, 2008; Saad, 2007, 2008), and evolutionary psychology is the only
theoretical framework equipped to unite all of the sub-disciplines together (Saad, 2007,
2008). Therefore, evolutionary psychologists must all remain vigilant researchers and
theorists, continuing on the current road of progress that this review has shown. As more
evolutionary psychological research and theories are produced, the closer all psychologists
come to a unified science of psychology.
Evolutionary Psychology Outside the Academic Realm
The progress made toward the integration of evolutionary principles into all areas of
the natural and social sciences over the past 150 years has been immense. Subsequently,
evolutionary psychology is slowly being met with greater acceptance within the other sub-
disciplines of psychology. However, it has also been met with disbelief and opposition.
Many people still resist evolutionary psychology because of false assumptions, such as
those pertaining to the erroneous theory of genetic determinism and the horrific policy of
eugenics.
Religion has also offered an area of persistent resistance. During the 2008
presidential primary, Barack Obama was criticized for making a statement regarding how
American citizens cling to their guns and religion during economic hardship. He was not
far from the truth. People are driven into frenzies when their religion is challenged. This
has been revealed throughout history by the amount of wars and terrorist acts started in the
name of religion (the Crusades, the World Trade Center attacks, etc.).
On a more optimistic note, the Catholic Church's recent acceptance of evolution
and genetics indicates that religious figures are increasingly accepting scientific findings.
Similarly, continuous research and theory have been showing the differences between
evolutionary psychology and genetic determinism (Dawkins, 2006). In addition, eugenics
has not been a widely accepted policy for over 60 years. Thus, evolutionary psychology
still has a road of resistance ahead; but if evolutionary researchers continue to work at the
Acceptance of and resistance to evolutionary psychology

current pace, evolutionary psychology will eventually overcome these oppositions and
become the foundation of psychology as a united field.
