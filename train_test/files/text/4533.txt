Introduction
Type 2 diabetes is said to be positioned to be one of the larg-
est epidemics in human history and one of the major threats
to human health in the 21st century (Zimmet, Alberti, &
Shaw, 2001). World Health Organization (2004) estimated
that there were 1.71 million people living with diabetes in
Nigeria and the figure was projected to reach 4.94 million by
the year 2030. The prevalence rate in Nigeria varies from one
location to another, for example, 0.65% in rural Mangu vil-
lage to 11.0% in urban Lagos. However, the prevalence rate
for Nigeria is put at 3.9% (International Diabetes Federation,
2009).
Despite the tremendous success at improving the lives of
those living with diabetes with technological breakthrough
in biomedical sciences, the management of type 2 diabetes
lies largely with those with diabetes. It includes practices that
must be carried out by the patients themselves. Such prac-
tices include eating a healthy diet, performing physical exer-
cise, taking medication as prescribed, monitoring of blood
glucose level, regular clinic visits, and managing stress,
among other practices (American Diabetes Association,
2002). However, performing these practices has remained
problematic for those living with the condition as it requires
behavioral change. Chinenye et al. (2012) and Chinyere,
Nandy, and Nwankwo (2010) claimed that most Nigerians
with diabetes have suboptimal glycemic control, are hyper-
tensive, have chronic complications of diabetes mellitus, and
do not practice self-monitoring of blood glucose. Okafor and
Ofoegbu (2012) observed suboptimal glycemic, blood pres-
sure control and dyslipidemia and overweight among sub-
jects studied. A study on illness beliefs and diabetes in
Uganda adults identified patients' limited knowledge about
diabetes in general as a major problem in diabetes manage-
ment (Ujelm & Nambozi, 2008). Baumann, Opio, Otim,
Olson, and Ellison (2010) found that few patients did home
glucose monitoring, considered activities of daily living as
regular exercise, and lack healthy food choices.
If people living with diabetes are to follow their physi-
cians' recommendations, it is imperative for the physicians
to understand their knowledge of diabetes and health beliefs
about diabetes and how these affect their following physi-
cians' recommendations. Understanding knowledge of dia-
betes and health beliefs may help in designing an effective
intervention program for those living with diabetes.
Therefore, this study was conducted to understand the asso-
ciation and influence of diabetes knowledge and health
beliefs on diabetes management among the Igala in Kogi
State, Nigeria.
The Igala are an ethnic group in Kogi east, Nigeria. They
are found around the triangle formed by the confluence of

Diabetes Knowledge, Health Belief, and
Diabetes Management Among the Igala,
Nigeria
Samuel Ojima Adejoh1
Abstract
The study examined the association and influence of diabetes knowledge and health beliefs on diabetes management among
the Igala, Nigeria. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire administered to 152 respondents living with diabetes.
The data were analyzed using SPSS. Almost half of the respondents had low diabetes knowledge. Significant relationship
existed between level of diabetes knowledge and diabetes management (1, N = 152) = 8.456, p = .004. There was a significant
positive relationship between perceived severity (0.549, p = .000), perceived benefits (12.383, p = .000), and diabetes
management. The regression result showed that diabetes knowledge influenced diabetes management ( = .262, t = 3.328,
p = .001) and health beliefs affected diabetes management ( = .07865, t = 2.439, p < .016). Although diabetes knowledge and
health belief are cognitive factors in diabetes management, they should not be considered in isolation of other social factors.

River Niger and River Benue and are located east of the con-
fluence. Boston (1969) likens the location of the Igala to
Poland in Europe, which seems to have been pulled in differ-
ent directions at different periods. The Igala still hold on to
their traditions, including the belief that traditional medi-
cines can cure all kinds of illnesses. There are no data on the
incidence and prevalence of diabetes among the Igala except
the national prevalence rate of 3.9 %, as estimated by the
International Diabetes Federation (2009) for Nigeria.
Theoretical Framework
The health belief model (HBM), developed by Becker and
Maiman (1975), is useful in explicating self-care activities
such as diabetes management recommendations and has a
focus on behavior related to the prevention of disease. The
foundation of the HBM is that individuals will take action to
prevent, control, or treat a health problem if they perceive the
problem to be severe in nature; if they perceive that the
action will yield or produce an expected outcome; and
because of the perceived negative consequences of therapy.
The HBM has been applied to a broad range of health
behaviors. Three broad areas can be identified: (a) preventive
health behaviors, which include health promoting (such as
diet, exercise) and health-risk (such as smoking) behaviors as
well as vaccination and contraceptive practices; (b) sick-role
behaviors, which refer to compliance with recommended
medical regimens, usually following professional diagnosis
of illness; and (c) clinic use, which includes physician visits
for a variety of reasons. The HBM states that an individual's
behavior can be predicted based on certain issues that the
individual may consider (perceived susceptibility, perceived
severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers) when
making a decision about a particular behavior concerning his
or her health (Glanz, Lewis, & Rimer, 1990). These concepts
were proposed to account for people's "readiness to act." An
added concept, cues to action, would activate that readiness
and stimulate overt behavior, while the concept of self-effi-
cacy, or one's confidence is the ability to successfully per-
form an action. These concepts were added to help the HBM
fit better the challenges of changing habitual unhealthy
behaviors, such as being sedentary, smoking, or overeating.
Using HBM, the likelihood of individuals with diabetes
mellitus adhering to biomedical prescription is determined
by certain variables. The first variable, susceptibility, refers
to the perception of vulnerability to diabetes and its compli-
cations. How do individuals perceive developing problems
due to diabetes, for example, hypoglycemia and hyperglyce-
mia? An individual's perception of diabetes complications
will likely motivate him or her to adhere to medical prescrip-
tions. The second variable, severity, is the perception of dia-
betes as a serious illness, ranging from perceiving
complications, such as blindness, to viewing diabetes as a
life-threatening disease. The third variable, benefits, con-
cerns the perception that the diabetes regimen will be
effective. For example, taking regular exercise and eating
regulated meals will make the patient feel better as a result of
taking these actions. The fourth variable, barriers, refers to
the perceived costs of adhering to the regimen. This deals
with how inconvenient the regimen is perceived to be, for
example, how much will it cost a patient to buy the drugs for
a month considering other responsibilities before the patient.
Finally, cues to action deals with either external (e.g., remind-
ers from family members when to take medications) or inter-
nal (e.g. feeling high and low blood sugar) cues the individual
associates with taking action.
Research Design
A convenient sample of 152 men and women living with dia-
betes who met the selection criteria and agreed to participate
in this study constituted the participants for the study. The
respondents were selected from seven hospitals owned by
governments, private individuals, and faith-based organiza-
tions that served as both out-patient and in-patient clinics.
The respondents were approached as they came in to see
their doctors or to have a blood glucose test. The selection
criteria for inclusion included the following: the individual
must have been diagnosed by a medical doctor as having dia-
betes, he or she must be attending clinics for treatment and
check-ups, he or she must be mentally sound to respond to
questions, and he or she must give a voluntary consent to
participate in the study. The instruments were in-depth inter-
view guide and questionnaire, which was either self-admin-
istered or interview administered, depending on the literacy
level of the respondent. For the illiterate respondents, the
questionnaire was transcribed from English to the Igala lan-
guage and back to English by experts in spoken and written
Igala. The questionnaire included questions on socio-demo-
graphic characteristics and diabetes knowledge test (DKT)
and diabetes HBM developed by Given, Given, Gallin, and
Condon (1983), on perceived susceptibility, perceived sever-
ity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. These were
used to measure the diabetes knowledge and beliefs about
diabetes from those with the condition. The study was con-
ducted between August 2008 and December 2009. The study
was approved by the ethical committee of Kogi State
Ministry of Health.
Measurement of Diabetes Knowledge, Health
Beliefs Diabetes Management
The DKT consisted of 7 items administered to the respon-
dents. The 7 items were directly from the University of
Michigan DKT (2006) of 14 items but with modification,
substituting the food items on the original DKT with the
locally available food consumed in the study population. The
respondents were scored based on total correct responses out
of 7 items and were classified as either having low or high
diabetes knowledge.

The study adopted 16 questionnaire items, as developed
by Given et al. (1983), on perceived susceptibility, perceived
severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers, to mea-
sure the beliefs of diabetic patients about their diabetes. The
items were measured on a 5-point scale, ranging from
strongly disagree to strongly agree. To quantitatively capture
the degree of agreement to each item by the respondents, the
items were scored from the lowest to the highest. The item
scores for each scale were then summed up to serve as the
measure for the respective attribute. To ascertain how many
of the respondents scored high (good or satisfactory) or low
(bad or poor) on each of the attributes, a norm above which a
person was high and below which was low was created by
adopting the mean. This enabled ranking as high or low,
good or poor. The HBM scale consisted of 16 items and was
found to be reliable (16 items:  = 71), the subscales of per-
ceived susceptibility ( = 72), perceived severity ( = 63),
perceived benefits ( = 74), and perceived barriers ( = 71).
Diabetes management was measured using self-reports of
the respondents on the performance of their physicians' rec-
ommendations on medication, regular blood glucose testing,
weight management, eye and foot examination, regular clinic
visits, and regular physical exercise. However, metabolic
control was not included, as it requires blood samples which
were not performed in this study. Using the same method
described above, participants'responses were scored, ranked,
and classified as good or poor and high or low.
Results and Analyses
A total of 54% of the respondents were women, whereas
46% were men. The respondents' mean age was 56. The
mean age support Nyenwe, Odia, Ihekwaba, Ojule, and
Babatunde (2003), who state that diabetes is more frequently
found in people aged 50 years and above in Nigeria. Also,
29% of them had no formal education, 23% had primary edu-
cation, 18% secondary education, and 26% post-secondary
education. Besides, 34% were civil servants, 18% were self-
employed, 14% were retirees, and 15% were not in any paid
employment, whereas 12% were house wives.
Diabetes Knowledge
Table 1 below shows that 38% of the respondents could not
identify food that contains carbohydrate, and 43% could not
identify food with the highest concentration of fat. About
36% did not know what is the best method for testing blood
glucose, while 9% said that it is through urine testing. On the
issue of exercises, 46% did not know the effects of exercises
on individuals.
Regarding taking care of the feet, 32% did not know how
to take care of their feet. About 57% knew how best to man-
age their feet, while 12% got it wrong on how to take care of
the feet. About 59% did not know the effect of eating food
that contains less fat, 18% said that it decreased the risk of
kidney problem, whereas about 15% asserted that it decreases
the risk for heart diseases.
Table 2 above shows that 49% of the participants had low
diabetes knowledge, whereas 51% had high diabetes knowl-
edge. This result may be attributed to the low level

participants were only counseled after diagnosis on what to
do and what not to do.
Table 3 reveals that 30 respondents, representing about
41% of those with low level of diabetes knowledge, had
good diabetes management, whereas 50 respondents, repre-
senting about 64% of those with high level of diabetes
knowledge, had good diabetes management status. About
60% of the respondents with low level of diabetes knowl-
edge had poor management status, whereas 36% of those
with high level of knowledge had poor management status.
The result further shows that there was an association
between level of diabetes knowledge and diabetes manage-
ment status (1, N = 152) = 8.456, p = .004.
Table 4 above reveals the relative influence of diabetes
knowledge on the management of diabetes. The result shows
that diabetes knowledge would significantly influence diabe-
tes management ( = .262, t = 3.328, p = .001).
Diabetes Health Belief
Perceived susceptibility.Participants responded to four items
about their perceived susceptibility to complications (such as
"my diabetes would be worse if I did nothing about it").
Agreement with each item was indicated on a 5-point scale
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The
mean of the item served as a measure of perceived suscepti-
bility (M = 17.11, SD = 2.08). Higher scores indicated the
ability of the patient to control his or her diabetes.
Table 5 shows that 40% and 56% of those with low and
high perception of susceptibility to diabetes complications
had poor diabetes management status, respectively, com-
pared with 60% and 44% of those with low and high percep-
tion of susceptibility to diabetes complications with good
diabetes management. However, the chi-square statistics
result shows no relationship between perceived susceptibil-
ity and diabetes management (p > .05). Hence, the hypothe-
sis that stated that perceived susceptibility to complications
of diabetes will motivate the individual to follow doctor's
recommendations was rejected.
Perceived severity.The respondents reported their belief of
severity of their diabetes by rating how serious their diabetes
will have bad effect on their future health (for instance, "my
diabetes will cause me to be sick a lot"). The means of these
ratings served as measures of perceived severity (M = 13.38,
SD = 2.07). Four items assessed perceived severity on a
5-point scale, ranging from strongly agree to strongly
disagree.
The bivariate analysis showed that 73% and 17% of those
with low and high perception of severity had poor diabetes
management status, respectively, whereas 27% and 83% of
those with low and high perception of severity of diabetes,
respectively, had good diabetes management status. The
analysis shows a significant relationship between perception
of severity and diabetes management (1, N = 152) =
47.5555549, p = .000.
Perceived benefits.Four items were used to measure per-
ceived benefits of taking action by the respondents. Exam-
ples are "I believe I can control my diabetes" and "my
medicine would make me feel better" assessed on a 5-point
scale of strongly disagree to strongly agree. The mean of the
four items served as the measure of perceived benefits (M =
17.16, SD = 2.20).
The bivariate result showed that 35% and 64% of those
with low and high perceived benefits, respectively, had
poor diabetes management status, whereas 65% and 36%
of those with low and high perceived benefits of follow-
ing biomedical recommendations, respectively, had good
diabetes management status. The statistics showed that
there was a significant relationship between perceived
benefits and diabetes management (1, N = 152) = 12.383,
p = .000.
Perceived barriers. The respondents rated four items acting as
barriers to diabetes management status on a 5-point scale,
ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. These
included "I would have to change too many habits

and follow my prescriptions" to "following prescriptions
interfere with my normal daily activities." The mean of the
rating was used to measure the perceived barriers (M = 11.88,
SD = 2.48); higher scores showed more barriers to diabetes
management.
Table 1 shows that 54% and 46% of those with low and
high perceived barriers, respectively, had poor management
status, whereas 46% and 59% of those with low and high
perceived barriers to following recommendations had good
management status. The chi-square result showed that there
was no significant relationship between perceived barriers
and diabetes management (p > .05). Hence, the hypothesis
which states that perceived barrier will impede the individual
from following doctors' recommendations was rejected.
The result on the aggregate of all subscales of HBM
showed that 42% and 51% of those with low and high per-
ception of health belief, respectively, had poor diabetes man-
agement status, whereas 58% and 49% of those with low and
high perception of health belief, respectively, had good man-
agement status. The result shows that statistically there is no
relationship between the aggregate health belief and diabetes
management.
Regression Analysis
A further analysis in Table 6 shows that health belief ( =
.07865, t = 2.439, p < .016) was found to have strong influ-
ence on diabetes management.
Discussion and Conclusion
The study examined the association and influence of diabe-
tes knowledge, diabetes beliefs, and diabetes management,
including self-report to following physician's
recommendations.
The result which linked high level of diabetes knowledge
with poor management status supports a similar study that
found good level of diabetes knowledge with poor adherence
to recommendations (Al-Deagi, McElnay, & Scott, 1995).
The association between diabetes knowledge and diabetes
management supports a study that has demonstrated that
increased glycemic control is associated with higher scores
of diabetes knowledge (Colleran, Starr, & Burge, 2003).
In this study, diabetes knowledge was associated with
management status. This agrees with Glasgow and
Anderson's (1999) claim that disease-specific diabetes
knowledge may be a process or mediating variable that

interacts with other factors to affect self-care, which may
affect short- and long-term health outcomes. This may be
related to the perceived susceptibility of health belief, par-
ticularly the assertion that knowledge of the complications of
diabetes may lead to taking the necessary preventive
measures.
The study showed that, even though some respondents
had high diabetes knowledge, some of them still had low
management status. This finding is in line with the study by
Bautista-Martinez et al. (2008) that the acquisition of diabe-
tes-related knowledge is not enough to increase compliance
with diabetes treatment. According to Klepac (1996), indi-
viduals will not carry out a health-related behavior unless
they have at least a minimal level of health motivation and
knowledge, see themselves as vulnerable and the condition
as threatening, are convinced of the health behavior efficacy,
and find few barriers to the action. Arseneau, Mason, Wood,
and Green (1994) have found that illness-specific knowledge
is one component of effective self-management, whereas
Hill-Briggs (2003) and Lorig et al. (1996) identify other
components to include behavioral skills, cognitive problem-
solving abilities, and a sense of efficacy in bringing these
capabilities to bear to affect disease outcome. The implica-
tion of the finding is that diabetes knowledge is an important
factor on how patients will follow their management plan but
should not be seen as an end in itself.
The low level of diabetes knowledge found in this study
compares relatively with other studies on diabetes knowl-
edge by Fitzgerald et al. (1998) and Murata et al. (2003).
While other empirical evidences from other studies suggest
that people affected with diabetes often have inadequate
knowledge about the nature of diabetes, its risk factors, and
associated complications (Jabbar, Contractor, Ebrahim, &
Moahmood, 2001; Kamal, Biessels, Duis, & Gispen, 2000).
Consensus among the health care providers in the communi-
ties attests to the low level of diabetes knowledge in the
study communities they described the level of diabetes
knowledge among the people as shallow.
As the findings show, perceived severity and perceived
benefits were significantly related to diabetes management.
This may be explained by the fact that not all the constructs of
HBM will directly affect diabetes management. Rather, other
factors, such as socio-demographic characteristics, diabetes
knowledge, perception, psychosocial factors, patients'factors,
and cultural beliefs (Arndt et al., 2001; Williams, Whittle, &
Gatrell, 2002), will have to be all present to activate the beliefs.
For the present study, the health beliefs related with dia-
betes management were perceived severity and perceived
benefits. This finding is supported by Glasgow, McCaul, and
Schafer (1986), who avers that beliefs about treatment effec-
tiveness appear to have an important influence on diabetes
self-management. Ayele, Tesfa, Abebe, Tilahun, and Girma
(2012) also found that those respondents with high perceived
severity of diabetes and less perceived barrier to self-care
were more likely to take diabetes self-care. Garcia and Mann
(2003) also confirmed the predictability of three variables
out of the four variables, with susceptibility, barriers, and
benefits explaining 43% of the variance of intention to resist
dieting. Nejad, Wertheim, and Greenwood (2005) found that
the best predictors of weight loss were perceived susceptibil-
ity and perceived benefits, while perceived benefits of diet-
ing and severity (a measure of how negatively weight gain is
perceived) significantly predicted intention to diet.
Similarly, Cerkoney and Hart (1980) found that the com-
bination of the five HBM variables accounted for 25% of the
variance in adherence, as measured by self-report in combi-
nation with a reactive direct observational procedure. Based
on the results from this study using HBM, it can be said that
HBM alone is a poor predictor of diabetes management
among those with diabetes in the studied population. This is
evident as only perceived severity and perceived benefits had
significant relationships with diabetes management. The
value expectancy assumption of the model seems weak
among the study respondents. This could be linked to the
belief among the Igala that all diseases are curable using
local herbs from competent herbalists. This result supports
Adejoh's (2011) claim that, among the Igala, there is a strong
belief in Igala medicine in curing all kinds of diseases. This
could have implications for how a person will manage his or
her condition. Hence, using HBM alone could be misleading
and lead to wrong decisions and judgments.
The findings of this study are in line with a review which
found that the individual components (severity, susceptibil-
ity, benefits, and barriers) each only accounted for 0.5% to
4% of the variance in behavior (Harrison, Mullen, & Green,
1992). Brownlee-Duffeck et al. (1987) found that measures
of health beliefs accounted for 41% to 52% of the self-
reported adherence and that perceived severity and perceived
benefits were associated with greater self-reported adherence
and metabolic control.
This study was not an experimental design and was lim-
ited to self-report of the respondents. Hence, the validity of
the model in this population has not been tested. The study
only took a convenient sample from one ethnic group in an
ethnically diverse region. So the generalization of these find-
ings must be with caution. Also, the responses to all the ques-
tions were all self-reports. There could be the problem of
recall from the respondents, which might make the reliability
of the responses difficult to validate. Besides, this report was
limited to diabetes knowledge and health beliefs using HBM
and so did not give room to examining cultural beliefs affect-
ing diabetes management among the studied population.
Similarly, only four components of the earlier version of
HBM were used to measure health beliefs in this study, hence
the need to expand the study and include the added compo-
nents of the revised model. However, it is hoped that the
findings from this study will stimulate further studies on dia-

Nigeria, with particular focus on cultural beliefs in relation
to diabetes health beliefs.
