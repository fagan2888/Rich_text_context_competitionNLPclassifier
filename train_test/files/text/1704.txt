ABSTRACT
Background: Folic acid can prevent up to 70% of neural tube
defects (NTDs) if taken before pregnancy. Compared with other
race-ethnicities, Hispanic women have higher rates of NTDs, lower
rates of folic acid supplement use, and lower total folic acid intakes.
Objective: The objective was to assess potential effects of fortify-
ing corn masa flour with folic acid on Mexican American women
and other segments of the US population.
Design: A model was developed by using data from the Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001­2004
to estimate the folic acid content in foods containing corn masa
flour if fortified at a level of 140 lg folic acid/100 g corn masa
flour.
Results: Had corn masa flour fortification occurred, we estimated
that Mexican American women aged 15­44 y could have increased
their total usual daily folic acid intake by 19.9% and non-Hispanic
white women by 4.2%. Among the US population, estimated rela-
tive percentage increases in total usual daily folic acid intake with
corn masa flour fortification were greatest among Mexican Ameri-
cans (16.8%) and lowest among children aged 1­3 y (2%) and
adults aged .51 y (0­0.5%).
Conclusion: Analyses suggest that corn masa flour fortification
would have effectively targeted Mexican Americans, specifically,
Mexican American women, without substantially increasing folic
acid intake among other segments of the population. Such increases
could reduce the disparity in total folic acid intake between Mexi-
can American and non-Hispanic white women of childbearing age
and implies that an additional NTD preventive benefit would be
observed for Mexican American women. Am J Clin Nutr 2009;

INTRODUCTION
Neural tube birth defects (NTDs) are serious birth defects of
the brain (anencephaly) and the spine (spina bifida) that occur
early in embryogenesis (1). Although infants born with anen-
cephaly die shortly after birth, infants born with spina bifida can
lead full and productive lives, albeit often with serious dis-
abilities. Research has shown that folic acid, a water-soluble B
vitamin, can prevent 70% of folic acid­preventable NTDs
when taken before and during early pregnancy (2­4). In 1992,
the US Public Health Service issued a recommendation that all
women capable of becoming pregnant consume 400 lg folic
acid/d to reduce the risk of having a child born with an NTD (5).
This recommendation was followed by a US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) mandate to fortify enriched cereal grain
products, starting in 1998, with folic acid at 140 lg/100 g flour
(6). It was estimated that this level of fortification would provide
on average an additional '100 lg folic acid/d (7­9). Indeed,
dietary data analysis from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001­2002 indicated that
women of reproductive age reported receiving on average an
additional 128 lg folic acid from fortified foods (10). In 1998,
the Institute of Medicine published a review of data current at
that time on folic acid and recommended that all women capable
of becoming pregnant should consume 400 lg folic acid/d from
fortified foods and supplements, or both, in addition to con-
suming a diet high in folate-rich foods (11).
According to surveillance systems with prenatal ascertain-
ment during the period 1999­2000, '3020 pregnancies were
affected each year by an NTD in the United States, with a total
of 1640 infants born with spina bifida and 1380 infants born
with anencephaly (12). There were racial-ethnic disparities in
the rates of NTDs; Hispanic women had higher rates than other
race-ethnicities. Williams et al (13) noted that, before fortifica-
tion, Hispanic women had a prevalence rate of 10.34 births af-
fected by NTDs per 10,000 births compared with 7.92/10,000
births for non-Hispanic white women. These rates decreased
significantly after fortification (Hispanic women: 7.02/10,000;

non-Hispanic white women: 5.35/10,000); however, the racial-
ethnic differences remained (13). In addition to the differences
in rates of NTD prevalence, Yang et al (10) found differences in
folic acid consumption, with a lower proportion of Hispanic
women consuming !400 lg folic acid from fortified foods and
supplements than non-Hispanic white women. This was con-
sistent with other findings indicating that Hispanic women were
the least likely to report awareness of folic acid and consump-
tion of supplements containing folic acid (14).
Because of the persistence of the racial-ethnic differences in
NTD prevalence rates, even after fortification of enriched cereal
grains with folic acid, it was hypothesized that fortification of
a product that could specifically target Hispanic women might
increase their overall average intake of folic acid and thus reduce
their risk of NTDs. Similarly, a targeted approach might not
unduly increase the average daily folic acid intake of the general
population, for those segments of the population for whom the
intervention was not intended (ie, males).
To address this strategy, researchers investigated whether
corn masa flour, which does not have a standard of identity as
developed by the FDA, could be used as a vehicle for a targeted
folic acid­fortification program. Corn masa flour is a key in-
gredient in many traditional Latin American cuisines, including
corn tortillas, enchiladas, and tamales. Corn masa flour food
items are reported to be consumed in appreciable quantities in
the Latin American diet, particularly among Mexicans and
Central Americans (15). A model was developed to assess the
potential effect of additional folic acid fortification of corn
masa flour on the folic acid intakes of Mexican Americans,
specifically Mexican American women, and that of the general
US population.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
NHANES 2001­2004
NHANES 2001­2004 was conducted according to a stratified
multistage probability design. The survey captured a nationally
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian US
population. Respondents participated in a household interview
and a physical examination. For this analysis, we did not include
individuals who were pregnant and those whose dietary interview
did not meet minimum required standards for data quality (16).
Additionally, analyses reported by race-ethnicity were restricted
to non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican Amer-
ican respondents because of the small number of individuals of
other racial and ethnic groups. All participants in NHANES
provided written informed consent.
Modeling of folic acid intake from corn masa flour
Modeling possible folic acid intake from fortified corn masa
flour entailed 4 main steps: 1) identification of foods that con-
tained corn masa flour, 2) determination of the proportion of
corn masa flour per food item, 3) determination of the amount of
additional folic acid derived from corn masa flour fortified at
140 lg folic acid/100 g corn masa flour per food item, and 4)
creation of model variables with the additional folic acid intake
from fortified corn masa flour.
To identify foods that could contain corn masa flour, 4
researchers independently reviewed '6940 foods listed in the
NHANES 2001­2004 food codes. Three of the researchers were
Hispanic. Each individual's list was compared for similarities and
differences in identifying foods. Foods were excluded if they
contained words such as white flour or if the conventional
product used was a white flour tortilla (eg, burritos). Foods were
included in the initial list if there was a good possibility that they
contained corn masa flour. The resulting list of foods was then
reviewed by an international manufacturer of corn masa flour to
validate whether the foods identified did indeed contain corn
masa flour. Foods identified by researchers and validated by an
international manufacturer of corn masa flour were included in
the analyses, which resulted in 87 foods from the food code list
(Appendix A).
To determine the proportion of corn masa flour present in each
food, each food item was identified in the MyPyramid Equiv-
alents Database for the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Survey Food Codes, 1994­2002, version 1.0. On the basis of data
from 2001 to 2002, the individual components or commodities of
each food product were identified (eg, non-whole-wheat grains,
vegetables, or fruit). Because this database did not specifically list
corn masa flour as an individual component of food products, the
non-whole-wheat grain component was used as a proxy. For most
of the foods identified and analyzed, the entire grain component
was listed as nonwhole grains. For purposes of this analysis, corn
masa flour was considered a non-whole-grain based on its
manufacturing process, called nixtamalization--a process that
involves steeping dried corn in hot water and exposing it to
calcium hydroxide or lime (17). This process hydrolyzes the
pericarp and removes it from the grain. The aqueous solution is
then drained, and the remaining nixtamal is washed several
times, removing seed coats, tip caps, excess lime, and any other
impurities (17, 18). It was assumed that most identified food
products would use corn masa flour as the major flour or grain
ingredient, thus making the non-whole-grain component a rea-
sonable proxy.
To determine the total grams of flour in each food item, the
total grain ounce equivalents, made up of both nonwhole grains
and whole grains, were multiplied by 16 g. MyPyramid Equiv-
alents Database documentation used 16 g as a standard amount of
flour in 1 ounce equivalent for many of the foods in the grains
group. Sixteen grams of flour is found in a slice of commercial
white bread weighing 26 g. From this, the proportion of non-
whole-grain grams per food item, the proxy for the amount of
corn masa flour, was determined. A sample calculation follows:
Food item A
Total grain ounce equivalents: 3.5
Nonwhole grain ounce equivalents: 2.0
Whole grain ounce equivalents: 1.5
Grams of nonwhole grain: 2.0 3 16 ¼ 32 g nonwhole grain in
food item A
Because the proportion of nonwhole grain ounce equivalents
was not available for the NHANES 2003­2004 food products,
a ratio of the nonwhole grain ounce equivalents per gram of food
for each food item from the MyPyramid Equivalents Database
2001­2002 data were used to determine the nonwhole grain
ounce equivalents for 2003­2004 data. A sample calculation
follows:

Folic acid fortification was simulated by adding an additional
140 lg folic acid per 100 g corn masa flour. On the basis of the
preceding example, food item A would have had an additional
44.8 lg folic acid added from corn masa flour (32 g nonwhole
grain 3 140 lg/100 g) and food item B in 2003­2004 would have
had 10.14 lg folic acid added from corn masa flour (7.24 g
nonwhole grain 3 140 lg/100 g). The total amount of folic acid
an individual would have consumed with folic acid fortification
of corn masa flour included the estimated or expected intake from
fortified corn masa flour plus the actual reported folic acid intake
from foods and supplements.
Folic acid intake from foods
Estimated intakes of folic acid in foods were obtained by using
one 24-h food recall questionnaire in NHANES 2001­2002 and
two 24-h food recall questionnaires for NHANES 2003­2004.
The USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies
(FNDDS) version 1.0 was used to calculate all nutrient intakes for
NHANES 2001­2002, and version 2.0 was used to calculate all
nutrient intakes for NHANES 2003­2004. The FNDDS is the
most current database for nutrient composition of foods, in-
cluding folic acid found in fortified foods. A detailed description
of the FNDDS is published elsewhere (http://www.ars.usda.gov/
Services/docs.htm?docid¼12089).
Folic acid intake from supplements
During each household interview in NHANES 2001­2004,
the participant was asked about his or her use of dietary sup-
plements, including single vitamins, multivitamins, minerals,
herbs, and other similar nutritional substances over the past
month. The interviewer recorded the name of each product and
matched it to a list of known products. After the survey,
NHANES staff obtained label information for each reported
supplement to determine the ingredients. A participant was
classified as a user of a dietary supplement containing folic acid
if he or she reported taking such a supplement at least one time
during the past month. Folic acid intake was calculated for each
supplement on the basis of folic acid content, the number of
days a supplement was taken, and the quantity of the supple-
ment taken per day during the previous month. The average
daily folic acid intake for each supplement was calculated, and
the values were totaled across all supplements taken by each
participant to yield the average daily amount of supplemental
folic acid consumed (10). This estimate was added to the
amount of folic acid consumed from foods for each day of
intake for each individual.
Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted by using the modeled folic acid
intake to determine the potential contribution fortified corn masa
flour would have on folic acid intake. It has been reported that
estimates of nutrient intake based on one day's worth of intake
do not account for possible within-person variation (18, 19).
Therefore, PC-SIDE version 1.02 (Iowa State University, Ames,
IA) was used to estimate usual nutrient intakes, which takes into
account both between- and within-person variation when a sub-
sample of the population has !2d worth of intake as in
NHANES 2001­2004. In the combined 4-y sample, respondents
in the 2001­2002 wave provided only 1 d of intake information,
whereas almost all of those in the 2003­2004 wave provided 2
independent days of intake information. If we can assume that
the day-to-day variability in intakes did not change between
waves, then we can use the within-person variance estimate
based on 2003­2004 information to adjust daily intakes from the
entire combined sample. Detailed descriptions of this method
are given elsewhere (19, 20). We used PC-SIDE to calculate the
distributions (medians, percentiles, and proportions ,400 lg) of
folic acid intakes for women aged 15­44 y by race-ethnicity
(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican Ameri-
can), age (15­24, 25­34, and 35­44 y), and among Mexican
American women who reported consuming corn masa flour. A
second analysis was conducted to calculate the distributions
(medians and percentiles) of folic acid intakes for the total US
population by sex, race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, and Mexican American), and age (1­3, 4­8, 9­
13, 14­18, 19­30, 31­50, 51­70, and .70 y). Medians for total
calorie intake by race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, and Mexican American) were calculated by using PC-
SIDE. We also used PC-SIDE to estimate the best linear un-
biased predictor (BLUPS) of individual usual folic acid intakes.
BLUPS were outputted for further analyses by using Complex
Samples SPSS version 14.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
BLUPS were not Gaussian. We log-transformed BLUPS to
normalize the distribution and calculated the difference in the
logs of BLUPS [log(modeled intake) ­ log(actual intake)] to
estimate the predicted relative percentage changes in usual daily
folic acid intake due to corn masa flour fortification. This method
was used because direct comparisons of medians was difficult
without a good estimate of the SE of the difference. Differences
in proportions were tested by using 2-tailed t tests.
We used 4-y dietary weights for all analyses, as recommended
by the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (16). For analyses conducted
with PC-SIDE, SEs were calculated by using a set of 60 Jack-
knife replicate weights. Replicate weights were calculated by
using a combination of day 1 dietary weights for NHANES
2001­2002 data and day 2 dietary weights for NHANES 2003­
2004.
A total of 292 participants (241 from 2001 to 2002 and 51 from
2003 to 2004) who reported consuming a supplement containing
folic acid were missing information regarding the frequency of
supplement use. These participants were not included as sup-
plement users in the analyses presented. To determine whether
this exclusion would have affected the results presented, a sen-
sitivity analysis was conducted. Individuals with missing fre-
quency data were assigned a daily intake of either 0 or 400 lg.

RESULTS
NHANES 2001­2002 selected 13,156 individuals for the
sample; 11,039 were interviewed (83.9%) and 10,477 were ex-
amined in the Mobile Exam Center (79.6%). NHANES 2003­
2004 selected 12,761 individuals for the sample; 10,122 were
interviewed (79.3%) and 9,643 were examined in the Mobile
Exam Center (75.6%). This left 20,120 individuals available for
analysis of all ages. Individuals whose dietary interviews did not
meet the minimum required standards for data quality for day 1
and day 2 (n ¼ 2,206) and women who reported being pregnant
at the time of the survey (n ¼ 571) were not included in the
analyses. Most of those individuals excluded for poor data
quality on their dietary interview were either infants or children
aged ,2 y whose reported consumption of breast milk limited
the ability to quantify the total caloric and nutrient intake (n ¼
323). The remaining individuals did not complete the dietary
interview (n ¼ 1,703) or did not have reliable dietary intake data
(n ¼ 180). Individuals who were excluded because of unreliable
dietary intake data or who did not complete the dietary interview
were evenly split by sex and fairly evenly distributed by age
groups; however, more non-Hispanic whites were excluded.
Finally, 2 individuals were excluded who had reported daily
folic acid intakes .93 mg. This resulted in a final sample size of
17,341 individuals, of whom 49.4% were male, 70.1% were non-
Hispanic white, 11.8% were non-Hispanic black, 8.7% were
Mexican American. 4.7% were other Hispanic, and 4.7%
were other races or ethnicities, including multiracial (weighted
percentages). All ages of individuals were examined.
In addition, a separate analysis of women aged 15­44 y (n ¼
3767) was conducted. For this subset of the population, 318
women with dietary interviews who did not meet the minimum
required standards for data quality and 587 pregnant women were
not included. Women aged 35­44 y and non-Hispanic white
women were more likely to have been excluded on the basis of
their dietary interviews. This left 2,862 women aged 15­44 y for
analysis. Of these women, 66.9% were non-Hispanic white,
13.4% were non-Hispanic black, 9.4% were Mexican Ameri-
can, 5.4% were other Hispanic, and 4.8% were other races or
ethnicities, including multiracial (weighted percentages).
Demographics characteristics of the analytic sample by race-
ethnicity are shown in Table 1. Supplement use was a factor in
determining overall folic acid intake. Of women aged 15­44 y,
30% reported consuming a supplement containing folic acid.
Non-Hispanic white women were more likely to have reported
use (37%) than were Mexican American women (21%; P ,
0.001) and non-Hispanic black women (15%; P , 0.001).
Within the overall population analyzed, '33% of individuals
reported any use of supplements containing folic acid. Non-
Hispanic whites were the most likely to have taken supplements,
followed by Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks (38%,
19%, and 18%, respectively; P , 0.001). Females were more
likely to have reported supplement use than were males (36% vs.
30%; P , 0.001) (data not shown).
More than 25% of women aged 15­44 y reported consuming
corn masa flour (28%) on either day 1 or day 2 of the survey. Of
these women, more Mexican American women (60%) than non-
Hispanic black women (27%; P , 0.001) or non-Hispanic white
women (23%; P , 0.001) reported consuming corn masa flour.
Within the total US population, 56% of Mexican Americans
reported consuming products identified as containing corn masa
flour on either day 1 or day 2 of the survey compared with only
22% of non-Hispanic whites (P , 0.001) and 21% of non-
Hispanic blacks (P , 0.001). There were no differences in in-
take by sex, and 4­30-y-olds were more likely to have reported
a higher consumption than were the other age groups (data not
shown). Reported consumption of corn masa flour products in
2001­2002 and 2003­2004 were not significantly different (20%
compared with 20%; P ¼ 0.776) (data not shown). Additionally,
there were no differences in reported consumption of corn masa
flour products in 2003­2004 for day 1 intake compared with day
2 intake (20% compared with 18%; P ¼ 0.092) (data not
shown).
Usual calorie intake did not differ by race-ethnicity among
women aged 15­44 y. Similarly to that in women, usual calorie
intake did not differ by race-ethnicity within the total US pop-
ulation.
The total usual daily folic acid intake for US women aged 15­
44 y by race-ethnicity and age from all fortified foods and
supplements compared with the modeled intake with the addition
of folic acid fortified corn masa flour products for 2001­2004 is
shown in Table 2. The usual median daily intake for women
aged 15­44 y was 250 lg and in the model increased to 262 lg

with corn masa flour fortification--a 3.9% relative increase. On
the basis of the model, corn masa flour fortification resulted in
an estimated increase in the median usual daily intake within
each racial-ethnic group. Mexican American women had
a 19.9% relative increase in usual daily intake from actual to
modeled (from 212 to 253 lg) compared with a 4.2% (P ,
0.001 compared with Mexican Americans) and 5.3% (P , 0.001
compared with Mexican Americans) relative increase from ac-
tual to modeled for non-Hispanic white (from 273 to 285 lg)
and non-Hispanic black (from 175 to 185 lg) women, re-
spectively. With corn masa flour fortification, Mexican Ameri-
can women had modeled median usual daily intakes that were
much closer to those reported by non-Hispanic white women,
despite the higher prevalence of supplement use among non-
Hispanic white women. Women aged 15­24 (5.8%) and women
aged 25­34 y (4.3%) had a slightly larger relative percentage
increases than did women aged 35­44 y (1.3%) (P , 0.001 for
both). See Appendix B for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles
of usual daily intakes for women aged 15­44 y before and after
corn masa flour fortification modeling.
The proportion of women consuming ,400 lg was 73%
(actual) and was estimated to decrease to 71% with corn masa
flour fortification (modeled). On the basis of modeling, Mexican
American women had the largest decrease in the proportion of
women consuming ,400 lg (85­78%) after corn masa flour
fortification.
The distribution of the total usual daily folic acid intake from
all fortified foods and supplements compared with the modeled
intake with the addition of folic acid fortified corn masa flour
products for women aged 15­44 y by race-ethnicity is shown in
Figure 1. Almost no change in folic acid intake from actual to
modeled values was observed for non-Hispanic white and non-
Hispanic black women (Figure 1A and 1B); however, an in-
crease in the distribution of Mexican American women's usual
daily folic acid intake after corn masa flour fortification was
observed (Figure 1C).
The total usual daily folic acid intake for the US population by
sex, race-ethnicity, and age from all fortified foods and sup-
plements compared with the modeled intake with the addition of
folic acid fortified corn masa flour products for 2001­2004 is
shown in Table 3. The median usual daily folic acid intake was
272 lg. With corn masa flour fortification, the median usual
daily intake was estimated at 285 lg--a 3.2% relative increase.
The relative percentage increase in folic acid intake varied
slightly by sex (3.6% for males and 2.7% for females; P ¼
0.006), but varied more significantly by race-ethnicity. A re-
ported 16.8% relative increase in the usual daily folic acid intake
for Mexican Americans from actual to modeled (from 226 to
264 lg) was substantially higher than that seen for both non-
Hispanic whites (4.0%; P , 0.001) and non-Hispanic blacks
(3.6%; P , 0.001). All age groups saw relative percentage in-
creases in total folic acid consumption with corn masa flour
fortification. The smallest relative percentage increases were
among children aged 1­3 y (2.0%) and adults aged .51 y (0­
0.5%). The largest relative percentage increases were among
those aged 9­30 y, ranging from 4.1% to 5.5%. See Appendix C
for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of usual daily intakes for

fication modeling.
An analysis of the population who reported consumption of
corn masa flour on either day 1 or day 2 of the survey indicated
that, among Mexican American women aged 15­44 y (n ¼ 453),
the median daily intake of folic acid was 218 lg (95% CI: 183
lg, 253 lg). If corn masa flour had been fortified, intakes could
have increased to 290 lg (95% CI: 242 lg, 338 lg)--a 33.9%
increase (95% CI: 29.5%, 38.4%) (data not shown).
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether the
exclusion of participants with missing supplement frequency data
could have any effect on the results. Supplement users with
missing frequency data were given a value of either 0 lg daily
folic acid intake from supplements or 400 lg daily folic acid
intake from supplements. Data indicated that there was no

difference in the results when missing values were given a value
of either 0 or 400 lg. This showed that the exclusion of indi-
viduals with missing supplement frequency data would not have
altered the results significantly. Therefore, these individuals were
excluded in the analyses presented.
DISCUSSION
Corn masa flour fortification modeling predicted that the
overall usual folic acid intake of Mexican Americans, specifi-
cally, Mexican American women, was increased by this type of
fortification effort. The results suggest that Mexican American
women aged 15­44 y increased their usual daily folic acid intake
by 19.9%, and fewer Mexican American women would be
consuming less than the daily recommended intake of 400 lg.
For Mexican American women who reported consuming corn
masa flour on either day 1 or day 2 of the survey, this relative
percentage increase in usual daily folic acid intake could have
been as high as 33.9%. The disparity between usual daily folic
acid intakes among non-Hispanic white and Mexican American
women also could have been reduced, despite the higher reported
use of supplements containing folic acid among non-Hispanic

white women. Consuming 400 lg folic acid alone has been
shown to reduce the risk of NTDs (4). A positive shift in the
distribution of folic acid intake by fortifying corn masa flour
could provide significant public health benefits, with a specific
emphasis on the health of pregnancies among Mexican Ameri-
can women.
Food fortification is a long-standing public health intervention
that affects a large number of people without requiring specific
behavior changes. US folic acid fortification of enriched cereal
grain products is credited with an increase in red blood cell folate
concentrations and a 26% decrease in the prevalence of NTDs
within the United States (12, 21). Some research has also in-
dicated that folic acid might play a role in reducing the risk of
other diseases or conditions, such as other birth defects (22, 23),
some cancers, cardiovascular disease, and stroke (24­26);
however, more research is needed to know for sure. Along with
these benefits, concerns have also been raised about the potential
for adverse effects of high levels of folic acid, such as the ex-
acerbation of neurologic effects from exposure to very high
doses of folic acid (11), increased risks of certain cancers (27),
and cognitive decline (28, 29). Given the possible wide range of
effects that folic acid might have on different segments of the
population, it is not surprising that additional folic acid fortifi-
cation efforts to reduce NTDs should now address how other
subgroups of the population would be affected. Whether a corn
masa flour fortification program could effectively target the
Mexican American population, specifically Mexican American
women, and the effect of corn masa flour fortification on other
segments of the US population are discussed below.
Fortification, as an intervention, has been found to be effective
at reaching a wide range of individuals regardless of income,
educational level, or region (30). Fortification efforts can also be
targeted to very specific populations by focusing on food
products uniquely consumed by specific population subgroups
(31). Our results suggest that Mexican Americans appeared to be
targeted more effectively by corn masa flour fortification than
did other race-ethnicities. Specifically, the median usual daily
intake of folic acid by Mexican American women would be
much closer to that of non-Hispanic white women. Nevertheless,
with corn masa flour fortification, the median usual daily intake
for Mexican American women would still be below the rec-
ommended 400 lg of folic acid. Mexican American women
aged 15­44 y have a higher rate of NTDs (13), and some evi-
dence suggests that specific genotypes more common among
Mexican Americans might necessitate additional folic acid in-
take above 400 lg to prevent NTDs (32­36). Whether a 19.9­
33.9% relative increase in the median usual daily intake of folic
acid would shift the entire distribution and provide substantial
protection to Mexican American women merits further in-
vestigation.
The entire US population saw a shift to the right in its median
usual daily folic acid intake. This was seen more markedly among
Mexican Americans (16.8%) than among non-Hispanic whites
(4.0%) and non-Hispanic blacks (3.6%) or within age groups
(ranging from 0% to 5.5%) (Table 3). This suggests that corn
masa flour fortification could increase the median usual daily
intake of folic acid among Mexican Americans and would not
appear to substantially affect other segments of the population.

MODELING FOLIC ACID FORTIFICATION OF CORN MASA FLOUR 311

This study had several limitations. The USDA FNDDS does
not categorize foods by individual food commodities (eg, corn
masa flour, white flour, oil, cheese, and milk); therefore, we had
to identify foods that could possibly contain corn masa flour.
To address possible imprecision, researchers independently re-
viewed the complete list of food products and validated it with an
international manufacturer of corn masa flour. The proportion of
corn masa flour in each food product was obtained by a USDA
data set (MyPyramid Equivalents Database), which reported the
equivalents of different food groups (ie, grains groups and fruit
groups) within each food product. Corn masa flour was not
specifically identified in the database; however, it was assumed
that most of the grain used in each product would be corn masa
flour. If there were other flours used in the food products, such as
white or whole-wheat flour, the analyses would have over-
estimated the proportion of corn masa flour in each product and
the potential intake of folic acid from the fortified corn masa flour.
Reported consumption of corn masa flour on either day 1 or
day 2 of the survey was 56% among all Mexican Americans and
28% among all women aged 15­44 y. Although these percentages
suggest a moderate consumption of corn masa flour in the United
States, other data suggest that corn masa flour consumption is and
continues to be a large component of the diet among Hispanics in
the United States. A study that assessed the sources of nutrient
intakes among low-income Hispanic women and children found
that 29.4% of women and 21% of children reported consuming
corn tortillas (which are made from corn masa flour) based on
a 24-h recall (37). This estimate was much lower than our es-
timate for Mexican American women consuming corn masa
flour products (60%), most likely because our definition of corn
masa flour products included more than just corn tortillas. Data
from the USDA's Economic Research Service indicated that US
per capita consumption of corn flour and meal has increased by
178%, compared with only 32% for wheat flour, during the
period 1970­2000 (38). Additionally, research has suggested
that corn masa flour is widely consumed among Mexicans and
Central Americans (15, 39, 40). Based on the increase in per
capita consumption of corn flour and meal in the United States
(38) and the documented high level of consumption of corn
masa flour among Hispanics (15, 39, 40), the proportion of the
population exposed to corn masa flour, especially among the
Hispanic population, will remain fairly high within the United
States.
NHANES 2001­2002 and NHANES 2003­2004 used the most
current version of the FNDDS to analyze the nutrient content of
foods; however, 2 different versions were used for the analysis
(version 1 for 2001­2002 and version 2 for 2003­2004). Data
from the 2001­2002 and 2003­2004 periods were analyzed
separately to determine whether there were any significant dif-
ferences between data for these periods. Although the 2 versions
of the FNDDS did not appear to affect the analysis, there was not
an independent validation or comparison of the accuracy of the
estimated intakes for folic acid. The analysis used the appropriate
and most up-to-date version of the FNDDS; however, new
products are always entering the market, making the food-
composition database difficult to keep updated (41, 42). This
could have resulted in missing new products or coding new
products as products that no longer existed, which could have
misrepresented the nutrient intake of the US population. Addi-
tionally, analyses are based on the level of folic acid reported in
FNDDS. It has been suggested that the actual amount of folic
acid in foods could differ from what is allowed by the FDA and
lead to an underestimation of folic acid intake (43­45). Dietary
folic intake data used in the analysis were collected by using
24-h recalls, which are subject to systematic underreporting
(46). However, the differential effect of this underreporting on
specific food components and on population subgroups is not
well understood. Nonetheless, these analyses showed no dif-
ferences in reported total usual energy intake by race-ethnicity,
which suggests that if a bias were present, it was not limited to
one race-ethnic group. Additionally, daily folic acid supplement
intake was calculated by using an indirect method that assumed
that use over 1 mo could be applied to two 24-h recalls. This
calculation might not represent daily amounts for persons who
do not take supplements consistently.
Healthy People 2010 objective 16­16a promotes an increase
in the number of women of childbearing age who report con-
suming 400 lg folic acid/d to 80% to reduce their risk of NTDs
(47). On the basis of modeling, Mexican American women can
increase their folic acid intake by consuming fortified corn masa
flour products. Nevertheless, the median usual daily folic acid
intake for Mexican American women aged 15­44 y remains
well below the recommended 400 lg folic acid/d, even with
corn masa flour fortification. However, the addition of fortified
corn masa flour could cause a small upward shift in overall usual
median consumption of folic acid for the entire US population
and a larger upward shift among Mexican American women.
The shift in folic acid intake among Mexican American women
would reduce the disparity of folic acid intake between Mexican
American and non-Hispanic white women. Although it is diffi-
cult to estimate the exact benefit that corn masa flour fortifica-
tion could have on the prevalence of NTDs among Mexican
American women, the increased consumption of folic acid would
shift some women to a level of protection not apparent without
corn masa flour fortification.
