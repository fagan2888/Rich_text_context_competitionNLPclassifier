Abstract
Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high production volume chemical widely used in food and drinks packaging.
Associations have previously been reported between urinary BPA concentrations and heart disease, diabetes and liver
enzymes in adult participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003/04. We aimed to
estimate associations between urinary BPA concentrations and health measures in NHANES 2005/06 and in data pooled
across collection years.
Methodology and Findings: A cross-sectional analysis of NHANES: subjects were n = 1455 (2003/04) and n = 1493 (2005/06)
adults aged 18­74 years, representative of the general adult population of the United States. Regression models were
adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, smoking, BMI, waist circumference, and urinary creatinine
concentration. Main outcomes were reported diagnoses of heart attack, coronary heart disease, angina and diabetes and
serum liver enzyme levels. Urinary BPA concentrations in 2005/06 (geometric mean 1.79 ng/ml, 95% CI: 1.64 to 1.96) were
lower than in 2003/04 (2.49 ng/ml, CI: 2.20 to 2.83, difference p-value = 0.00002). Higher BPA concentrations were
associated with coronary heart disease in 2005/06 (OR per z-score increase in BPA = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.01 to 1.75, p = 0.043) and
in pooled data (OR = 1.42, CI: 1.17 to 1.72, p = 0.001). Associations with diabetes did not reach significance in 2005/06, but
pooled estimates remained significant (OR = 1.24, CI: 1.10 to 1.40, p = 0.001). There was no overall association with gamma
glutamyl transferase concentrations, but pooled associations with alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase
remained significant.
Conclusions: Higher BPA exposure, reflected in higher urinary concentrations of BPA, is consistently associated with
reported heart disease in the general adult population of the USA. Studies to clarify the mechanisms of these associations
are urgently needed.

Introduction
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a man-made compound that is suspected
to act as an endocrine disruptor, i.e. a compound capable of
causing dysfunction to hormonally regulated body systems [1].
More than 2.2 million metric tonnes of BPA are produced
worldwide each year for use mainly as a constituent monomer in
polycarbonate plastics, which are used extensively in drinks
containers and food packaging, and in the production of epoxy
resins used in the lining of canned goods [2]. Widespread and
continuous human exposure to BPA is believed to be mainly
through dietary intake [3], with additional exposure through
drinking water, dental sealants, dermal exposure and inhalation of
household dusts. It is one of the world's highest production volume
compounds and human biomonitoring data indicates that the
majority (over 90%) of the general population is exposed to BPA,
evidenced by the presence of measurable concentrations of
metabolites in the urine of population representative samples
[4,5,6].
The potential for BPA to cause adverse human health effects is
believed to be a consequence of its well-documented estrogenic
activity, with reports of both estrogen agonist [7] and androgen
antagonist [8] activity. Reported additional modes of action [9]
include liver damage [10,11,12,13,14], disrupted pancreatic Beta-
cell function [15], thyroid hormone disruption [16] and obesity
promoting effects [17]. Many of these effects have been reported
to occur at concentrations below recommended safe daily
exposure levels, prompting much recent debate on the require-
ment for revision of current legislation [18,19,20,21].
Once ingested BPA is metabolised to form the highly water
soluble major metabolite, bisphenol A-glucuronide. Volkel et al
reported that the half life for renal clearance of this metabolite
from blood following oral administration was 5.3 hours in adult
male and female subjects [22]. Exposure studies in humans are
restricted due to ethical reasons and by the difficulties in finding
individuals completely unexposed to BPA from the environment.
As such there are no in vivo data on the rate at which unconjugated
BPA is converted to bisphenol A-glucuronide in humans, only

predictions [6]. Given the urinary route of clearance of the major
metabolite, urine is considered to be the most appropriate body
fluid for BPA exposure assessment. Based on the animal and
laboratory evidence, we previously hypothesised that higher
urinary BPA concentrations would be associated with adverse
human health effects, especially in the liver and in relation to
insulin, cardiovascular disease and obesity. In 2008 data were
released from the US National Health and Nutrition Survey
(NHANES) 2003/04 providing the first large-scale population-
representative epidemiological data on urinary BPA concentra-
tions with sufficient statistical power to detect low-dose effects [6].
Higher BPA concentrations in NHANES respondents were found
to be associated with cardiovascular disease diagnoses (Odds Ratio
(OR) per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in BPA concentra-
tion = 1.39, 95% CI 1.18­1.63; p = 0.001 in fully adjusted
regression models). Higher BPA concentrations were also
associated with diagnosed diabetes (OR per 1SD increase in
BPA concentration = 1.39; 95% CI 1.21­1.60; p,0.001) but not
with other common diseases [23,24,25],suggesting specificity of
the reported findings.
These first reports clearly need to be replicated in independent
study samples, to ensure that the findings are robust and to refine
estimates of effect sizes. Here we report an epidemiological
analysis of the NHANES 2005/06 BPA biomonitoring results,
which measured BPA levels on a new independent cross-sectional
sample of the US non-institutionalized population. We re-tested
the originally identified associations of higher urinary BPA
concentrations associated with reported heart disease, diabetes
and liver enzymes. We also estimated the strength of these
associations in all the available data (combining NHANES 2003/
04 and 2005/06, termed here `the pooled data'.)
Methods
Data were from the US NHANES study 2003/04 and 2005/06
[26]. The study assesses health and diet, and the samples are
representative of the non-institutionalized population of the
United States. NHANES surveys are cross-sectional, recruiting
new samples for each wave. NHANES is administered by the
National Center for Health Statistics, the Health Statistics
Institutional Review Board of which approved the study.
Ethics Statement
NHANES is a publicly available data set approved by the
National Center for Health Statistics institutional review board,
and all participants provide written informed consent.
Assessment of Bisphenol A Concentrations
A one-third random subset of NHANES 2003/04 and 2005/06
participants supplied urine samples which were analyzed for BPA.
Studies of the temporal variability in urinary BPA concentrations
have reported single urinary measurements to show moderate
sensitivity for predicting an individual's tertiary categorization
[27]. A spot urine sample was collected from each respondent and
total (free and conjugated) urinary concentrations of BPA were
measured by the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciences (National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention) using online solid-phase extrac-
tion coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography­isotope
dilution tandem mass spectrometry with peak focusing. The
comprehensive quality control system included reagent blanks to
ensure samples were not contaminated during handling, stor-
age and analysis. (See http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/
nhanes_03_04/l24eph_c_met_phenols.pdf & http://www.cdc.gov/
nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_05_06/eph_d_met_phenols_parabens.
pdf [accessed 22 September 2009]. The lower limit of detection
(LLOD) for BPA concentrations was 0.36 ng/ml in 2003/04 and
0.4 ng/ml in 2005/06. BPA results below the LLOD (n = 116/
1455 in 2003/04 and n = 126/1493 in 2005/06 aged 18/74 years
with measured BPA and urinary creatinine levels) were replaced
with a value equal to the LLOD divided by the square root of two
in order to distinguish between a non-detectable laboratory test
result from a measured laboratory test result. We assigned the
2005/06 derived ``low'' value of 0.28 to all individuals from
either NHANES years with BPA concentrations below the
LLOD.
Health Outcomes
Questions relating to medical conditions were asked before the
physical examination, in the respondent's home, using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system. Respon-
dents aged 20 years and over were asked ``Has a doctor or other
health professional ever told you that you have...'' for angina,
coronary heart disease, heart attack, stroke, asthma, emphysema,
chronic bronchitis; arthritis, thyroid problems, any kind of liver
condition, or cancers. We defined `cardiovascular disease' (CVD)
as any reported diagnosis of angina, heart attack or coronary heart
disease. Respondents of all ages were also asked ``(Other than
during pregnancy,) have you ever been told by a doctor or health
professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes. We
combined self-reported diagnosed and borderline diabetes as
`diabetes' for analysis. Unfortunately fasting blood glucose levels
were only available for the participant subset seen in the mornings,
and were therefore not used in our analyses.
Data were analyzed for the three original liver enzyme markers
associated with BPA in 2003/04: gamma-glutamyl transferase,
which was measured by NHANES using an enzymatic rate
method; lactate dehydrogenase, using an enzymatic rate method;
alkaline phosphatase, using a 2-Amino-2-Methyl-1-Propanol
(AMP) buffer. Full details of analyte extraction and measurement
are available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm.
Statistical Analysis
The NHANES survey uses a complex cluster sample design,
with certain demographic groups (including those in low
socioeconomic positions and Mexican Americans) over-sampled
to obtain adequate representation. To account for the complex
sampling, weighted estimates were computed, in accordance with
the NHANES `Analytic and Reporting Guidelines' (http://www.
cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_general_guidelines_june_04.
pdf [accessed 22nd September 2009]. Sampling errors were
estimated by the Taylor series (linearization) method to take
account of stratification and clustering using the provided `masked
variance pseudo-psu' and `pseudo-stratum' variables. All analyses
were conducted using Stata SE Version 10. DM, NR and WH
analyzed the data.
The respondents included in our analyses were those aged 18 to
74 years (of those randomly selected by NHANES for BPA
measurement) in order to focus on adult health conditions. The 74
year age cut-off was selected to minimize biases caused by co-
morbidity and non-representation of seniors in institutions. Six
individuals with BPA concentrations greater than 80.1 ng/ml in
2005/06 were excluded from our analyses, as these high levels
were outside the range of BPA in the original 2003/04 sample.
One respondent was excluded due to a missing urinary creatinine
value in 2003/04, resulting in an included sample of n = 1455
respondents in 2003/04 and n = 1493 in 2005/06.
Bisphenol A and Heart Disease
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 January 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e8673
Standardized BPA measures were calculated using single wave,
cohort specific z-scores of BPA for independent NHANES wave
analyses and pooled wave, cohort specific z-scores of BPA for
pooled analyses. Logistic regression models were used to estimate
odds ratios of self-reporting doctor diagnosed heart disease and
diabetes per one standard deviation increase in BPA concentra-
tions. Linear regression models were used to estimate associations
between logged levels of liver enzymes and standardized BPA
concentrations.
Regression models were adjusted for potential confounders,
including socioeconomic markers which Calafat and colleagues [5]
reported to be associated with BPA concentrations, and urinary
creatinine to account for urine concentration [27]. Adjustment
was for: race/ethnicity, from self-description and categorized into:
Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-
Hispanic Black, and other race (including multi-racial); education,
categorized into: less than high school, high school diploma
(including GED), more than high school, and unknown education;
annual household income, categorized into: less than $20,000;
$20,000 to $35,000; $35,000 to $65,000; over $65,000, and
unknown income; smoking (from self-reported status asked in
those aged 20 and over), categorized into: never smoked, former
smoker, smoking some days, smoking every day, and unknown
smoking status; Body Mass Index (`BMI', measured weight in
kilograms divided by the square of measured height in meters),
categorized into: underweight (BMI,18.5), recommended weight
(BMI 18.5 to 24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0 to 29.9), obese I (BMI
30.0 to 34.9), obese II (BMI 35.0 or above), and unknown BMI;
waist circumference (in quartiles, with a missing value group); and,
urinary creatinine concentration in mg/dl.
Generalized additive models with cubic regression splines [28]
were used to explore the functional form of the relationships
between presence of a cardiovascular disease diagnosis and BPA
concentration. These models provide a method of identifying
departures from linearity in exposure-response relationships.
Linearity was assessed by visual inspection of the estimated spline
functions and by consideration of the ``estimated degrees of
freedom'' (edf) for the smoothed BPA term. Values of the edf close
to 1 were taken as evidence of linearity. These models were fitted
in the statistical software `R' using the mgcv package for
generalized additive modeling.
Power Calculations
Power calculations for analyses of diagnosis presence and liver
enzyme concentrations were conducted using the approaches
proposed by Hsieh et al [29] for logistic and linear regression
respectively. The 2003/04 sample provided 80% power to detect
unadjusted Odds Ratios of 1.4 for diagnoses of 5% prevalence per
standard deviation change in BPA concentration. Similar
calculations for the 2005/06 sample gave a reduced power of
73% to detect an effect size of this magnitude, after allowing for
the shift in the BPA distribution between waves. For liver enzymes,
the detectable effect size for 80% power was estimated using the
standardized regression coefficient of 0.075 found in 2003/04.
Power to detect this effect size was reduced to 74% in the 2005/06
sample after allowing for the reduction in variation in BPA
exposure levels.
Results
The study sample included 694 men and 761 women with
measured urinary BPA in the 2003/04 cohort, and 720 men and
773 women in 2005/06. The socio-demographic characteristics of
the two samples were otherwise similar (Table 1).
Urinary BPA levels were lower in the 2005/06 cohort (Figure 1)
than in the 2003/04 cohort: unadjusted geometric means:
1.79 ng/ml (95% CI: 1.64 to 1.96) vs 2.49 ng/ml (CI: 2.20 to
2.83); unadjusted arithmetic means: 3.30 ng/ml (CI: 2.88 to 3.72)
vs 4.59 ng/ml (CI: 3.95 to 5.24). In regression analyses of logged
BPA concentration adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity and urinary
creatinine, the difference in BPA levels between NHANES waves
was significant: (back transformed beta = 21.33 ng/ml, 95% CI:
21.19 to 21.50, p = 0.00002).
Per standard deviation increases in BPA concentration were
associated with positive responses to questions about physician
diagnoses of myocardial infarction in age, sex and ethnicity
adjusted models in 2005/06 (OR = 1.31, 95%CI: 1.02 to 1.68,
p = 0.036), with OR estimates for reported angina and `coronary
heart disease' being similar to 2003/04 but narrowly missing
conventional two sided statistical significance (Table 2). In pooled
models, positive responses to any of the three questions above
(here termed `cardiovascular diseases') was associated with BPA
concentrations (per SD increase in BPA OR = 1.26, CI: 1.11 to
1.43, p = 0.001). The estimated associations of BPA with reported
diabetes in 2005/06 was modest but with wide confidence
intervals; however, the diabetes association remained significant
in pooled data (OR = 1.27, CI: 1.12 to 1.43, p = 0.0004).
Odds ratios of reporting heart disease and diabetes diagnoses
were computed in fully adjusted models (Table 3), using z-scores of
BPA and adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income,
smoking, BMI, waist circumference and urinary creatinine
concentrations. Per standard deviation increases in BPA concen-
tration were associated with coronary heart disease (OR = 1.33,
CI: 1.01 to 1.75, p = 0.043) in 2005/06 but narrowly missed two
sided significance for myocardial infarction in 2005/06
(OR = 1.39, CI: 1.00 to 1.94, p = 0.051). Associations for any of
the three reported responses to cardiovascular disease were present
in pooled data in the fully adjusted models (OR = 1.26, CI: 1.10 to
1.44, p = 0.001). There was no association between BPA
concentration and diabetes in fully adjusted models in 2005/06
(OR = 1.02, CI: 0.76 to 1.38, p = 0.872), but an overall association
was still present in pooled data (OR = 1.24, CI: 1.10 to 1.40,
p = 0.001).
The association between BPA and the three liver enzymes
previously examined were not statistically significant in age, sex
and ethnicity adjusted models (Table 4) or fully adjusted models
(Table 5) in 2005/06, although overall associations in the pooled
data were still present for alkaline phosphatase (logged ALP
association with per-SD increase in BPA concentration be-
ta = 0.02, CI: 0.01 to 0.03, p = 0.002) and lactate dehydrogenase
(beta = 0.01, CI: 0.003 to 0.02, p = 0.009).
Models of the shape of the dose response curve (generalized
additive models with cubic regression splines, to 4 standard
deviations above mean of BPA concentration, Figure 2) showed
that there were linear relationships between BPA concentration
and cardiovascular disease in both 2003/04 and in 2005/06.
As a post hoc analysis, we examined associations between BPA
concentration and the other diseases originally examined in the
2003/04 data [23], namely arthritis, asthma, cancer, chronic
bronchitis, emphysema, liver disease, stroke or thyroid disease. We
found no associations between BPA concentrations and other
diseases in the 2005/06 cohort or in pooled analyses (data
available from authors).
Discussion
Previously, we reported an analysis of NHANES 2003/04, in
which we found associations between raised urinary BPA

concentrations and coronary heart disease, diabetes and raised
liver enzymes in adults. There was no evidence of association with
other reported health outcomes, suggesting specificity of the
findings. Here we sought to determine if these associations were
present again in the NHANES 2005/06 sample, and to calculate
pooled estimates of the effect sizes. These analyses use the only
large-scale (and high-quality) population-representative datasets
available. Urinary BPA concentrations were lower in 2005/06
than in the earlier NHANES wave, with a geometric mean value
of 1.79 compared with the earlier mean of 2.49. This represents a
fall of around 30%. After adjusting for potential confounders, we
found that higher BPA concentrations were again associated with

heart disease diagnoses. Associations of BPA concentration with
diabetes and liver enzymes were not statistically significant in the
2005/06 data, although pooled estimates remained significant.
Cardiovascular disease results from a complex interaction of
genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Whilst several
personal risk factors for developing heart disease have been
identified, including smoking, diabetes and dyslipidemia, the
contribution of environmental contaminants has received com-
paratively less attention. To date, the most widely reported
associations between cardiovascular disease and pollutants have
centred on exposure to air particulates, heavy metals, notably
arsenic and lead, and persistent organic pollutants.
It is pertinent to consider what is known of these previously
reported associations, to place the current findings of associations
with BPA into context. Studies of over 100 million people across
the USA and Europe have shown that for every 10 mg/m3
increase in aerial fine particulate matter (PM10), there is a 0.3%­
0.7% increase in cardiovascular mortality [30,31]. These effects
can appear and disappear quickly; transient increases in very fine
particulate matter are associated with an increased incidence of
acute myocardial infarction within a few hours, highlighting the
high sensitivity of cardiovascular tissues to the effects of
environmental contaminants [32]. Such associations are plausible
through several biological mechanisms, including alterations to
vasomotor tone [33,34], thrombogenic effects [35] and the
induction of systemic inflammation [36]. In the case of arsenic,
altered vascular tone appears to be of more importance to the
elevation in cardiovascular risk than vascular inflammation or
dislipidemia [37,38]. Animal studies have implicated dysregulation
of nitric oxide production and reactivity in arsenic's adverse effects
on cardiovascular risk [37], potentially via oxidation of protein
thiol groups, including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
[39]. A similar mechanism has been suggested for lead, which has
been associated with hypertension in both animal and human
epidemiology studies [40]. Both polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) can induce
oxidative stress-mediated alterations to normal vascular endothe-
lial cell function, leading to pro-inflammatory changes [41,42].
TCDDs can in addition cause an increase in atherogenic serum
lipid levels in animals and humans and a decrease in low density
lipoprotein receptors in the liver [43,44]. Such a combination of
damage to endothelial cells with elevation in serum lipid levels
could be expected to increase cardiovascular risk.
The relevance of these mechanisms to the reported association
between BPA and cardiovascular disease in the current study
remains subjective. For example, inflammation is a dynamic
response of vascularised tissues to injury, whilst excessive or
prolonged inflammation is associated with various diseases in
addition to cardiovascular disease [45]. Following oral ingestion,
BPA is not considered a persistent compound, but neither is it
immediately cleared from the body, and there appears to be
virtually continuous human exposure [46]. It is lipophilic (the log
of the octanol-water partition co-efficient (Kow
) for BPA is between
2.2 and 3.82 (NTP, 2008)) and it is plausible that partitioning to
lipid rich tissues could occur with frequent exposure. This
possibility is supported by recent findings that the population-
based half life for BPA is significantly longer than the previous
estimates of around 6 hours [3]. The metabolism of BPA is
reported to induce oxidative stress in rat hepatocytes following
long term (30 day) oral intake [10] and oxidative cellular damage
has been reported in a number of other experimental contexts
[11,12,13,14]. Slow release of BPA or metabolites from tissue sites
could theoretically lead to oxidative endothelial cell damage.

Bisphenol A and Heart Disease
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 January 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 1 | e8673
Urinary BPA concentrations have previously been shown to be
positively associated with oxidative stress markers. Hong et al [47]
found a significant dose-responsive relationship between BPA and
the oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-
deoxyguanosine (8-OHG) in a study of 960 adults, although the
relationship was not present in multiple regression models adjusted
for confounders including age and sex. Positive associations were
also reported between urinary BPA, MDA and 8-OHD, and with
C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker, in a cross-sectional
study of 134 post-menopausal women, but not in men or pre-
menopausal women from the same study [48]. These gender
differences suggest that occupancy and activation of the estrogen
receptor may have been a contributing factor in the induction of
oxidative stress.
BPA is believed to exert its biological effects largely through
loose occupancy of the estrogen receptor, and there are reports of
both estrogen agonist [7] and androgen antagonist [8] activity.
BPA also binds strongly to the estrogen-related receptor-gamma
(ERR-gamma), the function of which is unknown [9]. BPA
exposure of cell suspensions results in lipid accumulation in
adipocytes and hepatoma cell lines [49]. A variety of other effects
of BPA have been noted, including disrupted pancreatic Beta-cell
function producing insulin resistance in mice exposed to oral BPA
doses well below the current lowest observed adverse effect level
considered by the US-EPA [15]. Two days of low-dose BPA
injections also produced insulin resistance in mice [50]. Associa-
tions have been described previously between environmental
toxins, body weight, and diabetes [8,51] leading to suggestions that
exposure to certain environmental pollutants may initiate or
exacerbate the development of obesity [17] and associated health
problems [33]. Diabetes and dyslipidemia are recognized as
personal risk factors for developing heart disease. However,
associations with diabetes seen in the 2003/04 NHANES survey
was not evident in the current study, possibly because of the
reduction in statistical power due to the lower levels of BPA in
2005/06, resulting in wide confidence intervals around estimates.
It is possible that an as yet unidentified mechanism could be
involved in the effects of BPA on cardiovascular function. The
peroxisome proliferation activated receptor gamma, PPARc plays
a central role in the control of energy balance and lipid
homeostasis [52] and PPARc agonists such as rosiglitazone are
used to treat insulin sensitivity. There have been reports that in
addition to PPARc-mediated genome effects on genes important
for maintaining vascular tone (including eNOS), PPARc agonists
may activate or inhibit ion channel activity in vessel walls directly.
In studies of isolated vascular smooth muscle, rosiglitazone was
able to attenuate inward calcium currents and enhance calcium-
activated potassium currents [53]. Certain BPA derivatives,
including bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) are peroxisome
proliferation activated receptor gamma (PPARc) antagonists and
BADGE can block the adipogenic action of the receptor [54].
Although BPA has been reported to increase adipocyte differen-

tiation, it does not appear to affect PPARc through the same
mechanism as BADGE. Additional studies are clearly called for to
examine in detail the relationship between BPA and its derivates
and PPARc signaling.
A major limitation of our original analysis on NHANES 2003/
04 [23] was that no replication data were available to help exclude
the possibility of a chance finding. The 2005/06 analyses
presented here are based on an entirely new population sample,
providing an opportunity for independent replication of the
earlier findings. BPA concentrations in 2005/06 were substan-
tially lower than in 2003/04, resulting in a reduced power to
detect real associations. Despite this, we found near or significant
associations with responses to the three questions about heart
disease in NHANES 2005/06, and highly significant p-values for
the pooled estimates of association. We can now conclude that
chance is an implausible explanation for the BPA association with
heart disease. Replication of the BPA associations with diabetes
and liver enzymes are less certain, with estimates for 2005/06
having wide confidence intervals and not reaching statistical
significance. Because of the lower BPA concentration levels in
2005/06 a reduction in the strengths of association is to be
expected. The BPA measures in NHANES are based on single
spot specimens, so misclassification from this single snapshot of
body burden will have resulted in a smaller (diluted) estimate of
the strength of association between BPA and the conditions of
interest: the true associations are likely to be much stronger. In
addition, the pooled estimates of association suggest that the new
data is consistent with the original findings: larger samples will be
needed to provide accurate estimates of BPA associations with
diabetes or liver enzymes to exclude the possibility of real
associations being present.
The cross sectional nature of the associations reported need to
be treated with caution, as it is theoretically possible, for example,
that those with cardiovascular disease change their diets in such a
way as to increase BPA exposure. In addition, it is possible that
BPA exposure is associated with differential survival in cardiovas-
cular disease. Longitudinal data demonstrating that high BPA
concentrations predict later onsets of heart disease or diabetes
would strengthen the evidence for BPA playing a causal role. More
work is also needed to understand the mechanisms of effect
underlying the BPA exposure heart disease association, including
in vitro and in vivo studies.
Conclusions
Urinary BPA concentrations in the NHANES adult population
representative sample of the United States in 2005/06 were
substantially lower than in 2003/04. Despite this, we have
replicated earlier findings that higher urinary concentrations of
Bisphenol A are associated with an increased prevalence of
coronary heart disease.
Associations between urinary BPA concentration and diabetes
or liver enzyme increases were not statistically significant in 2005/
06, but confidence intervals were wide and associations remained
in pooled data. Detailed studies are needed to clarify the
mechanisms explaining the statistical association between BPA
and adult morbidity.
