Background: Low positive affect is closely related to common pathological responses to childhood adversity,
including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, but little is known about how the
characteristics of early adversity experiences might be related to positive affect in adulthood.
Objective: This study aimed to explore whether low positive affect is related to specific childhood adversities,
including abuse, neglect, caretaker dysfunction, and low childhood social support.
Method: Using structured interviews and self-report measure data collected from 173 adult psychiatric
inpatients, this study examined the relationship between positive affect and symptoms of psychopathology, as
well as how the number of types of abuse experienced, severity of adversity types (physical abuse and sexual
abuse), childhood environment (childhood social support, neglect, and caretaker dysfunction), and number of
non-abuse traumas related to positive affect.
Results: Positive affect was significantly negatively related to several symptoms of psychopathology, including
depression, dissociation, self-destructive behavior, PTSD, and global psychopathology. Individuals who
experienced both physical and sexual abuse reported significantly less positive affect than those with only
physical or no abuse experiences. Lower positive affect was predicted by lower childhood social support and
greater severity of sexual abuse, with both factors accounting for unique variance in positive affect.
Conclusion: These results suggest that individuals who experience multiple types of early adversity, more
severe sexual abuse experiences, and less social support are at risk of psychological difficulties. Given the
relatively strong association between positive affect and childhood social support, interventions to foster
social support may be a means of increasing positive affect among individuals exposed to childhood adversity.

Low positive affect is an important component of
psychopathology that is associated with poorer
functioning and resilience to daily and extreme
stressors, yet little research has investigated its rela-
tionship with traumatic stressors, including childhood
adversity. Better understanding the affective experiences
associated with childhood adversity could ultimately
allow for the development of more effective interventions
for individuals who experienced early adversities, includ-
ing fostering positive affect to promote resilience to and
recovery from these stressors. This study aimed to explore
whether low positive affect is related to specific childhood
adversities, including abuse, neglect, caretaker dysfunc-
tion, and low childhood social support.
Low positive affect and psychopathology
Low positive affect is an important component of various
forms of psychopathology, including social anxiety and
depression (Naragon-Gainey, Watson, & Markon, 2009;
Watson, Gamez, & Simms, 2005), and has been asso-
ciated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
self-harm (Frewen et al., 2010; Gratz, 2006). Low positive
affect is conceptually (Watson et al., 1995) and neurolo-
gically (see Davidson, 2000) distinct from negative affect.
Therefore, low positive affect presents an additional
challenge to individuals' functionality with distinctive psy-
chological, cognitive, and neurological correlates. Lower
positive affect is associated with greater PTSD symp-
tom severity (Feeny, Zoellner, Fitzgibbons, & Foa, 2000)

and poor recovery from depressive episodes (Rottenberg,
Kasch, Gross, & Gotlib, 2002). Individuals with low
positive affect also have worse memory for positive
events, expect fewer future positive events, and may
have self-regulation difficulties that limit their ability to
achieve goals (Andersen & Limpert, 2001; Aspinwall,
1998). Neurologically, low positive affect has been asso-
ciated with decreased activation in brain areas involved in
reward and higher-order cognition (Forbes & Dahl, 2005;
Frewen et al., 2010).
In contrast, greater positive affect seems to be an im-
portant factor in resilience to and recovery from psy-
chological stressors, including depressive and PTSD
symptoms (Ong, Bergeman, Bisconti, & Wallace, 2006;
Yamasaki, Uchida, & Katsuma, 2010). The NIMH
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project has identified
positive affect as an important area of functioning, and
dysfunction of this system is considered to cut across
diagnoses (Sanislow et al., 2010). Better characterizing the
association between positive affect and traumatic stres-
sors, including childhood adversities, could inform our
understanding of the factors involved in the develop-
ment and maintenance of posttraumatic psychopathol-
ogy, as well as prevention of and recovery from these
disorders.
Childhood adversities and posttraumatic
outcomes
Rather than being considered as a specific outcome, low
positive affect in adulthood has been primarily tied to
childhood adversity through its associations with depres-
sion and PTSD (Green et al., 2010; Hillberg, Hamilton-
Giachritsis, & Dixon, 2011). However, low or inappropriate
positive affect has also been directly associated with
poorer functioning in childhood sexual abuse survivors
(Bonanno et al., 2007), and greater severity of childhood
abuse experiences has been associated with lower positive
affect among women with PTSD (Frewen, Dozois, &
Lanius, 2012). The nature of the relationship between
positive affect and specific adversities relative to other life
experiences remains unclear, though. Based on studies of
the association between childhood adversity and other
negative psychological outcomes, low positive affect in
adulthood may be associated with the severity and type of
adversity experienced.
The severity of childhood adversity is often measured
by the number of discrete maltreatment experiences or by
the number of types of adversity experienced. Experien-
cing more incidents of maltreatment has been associated
with greater levels of PTSD and depression symptoms
(Vranceanu, Hobfoll, & Johnson, 2007). Similarly, ex-
periencing multiple types of maltreatment has consis-
tently been found to be related to poorer psychological
functioning in adulthood than experiencing only one type
of maltreatment (Cloitre et al., 2009; Edwards, Holden,
Felitti, & Anda, 2003; Green et al., 2010). Low positive
affect will, therefore, likely be associated with greater
severity of childhood adversity.
In contrast to the consistent association of severity of
childhood adversity with poorer psychological outcomes,
there is no clear consensus as to which types of adver-
sity are most associated with psychopathology (Arata,
Langhinrichsen-Rohling, Bowers, & O'Farrill-Swails,
2005; Paolucci, Genuis, & Violato, 2001). Recent findings
of associations between multiple types of abuse and
positive affect (Frewen et al., 2012) did not test for
differences between types of abuse, but early case studies
demonstrating differential effects of physical and emo-
tional abuse on infants' affect (Gaensbauer & Hiatt,
1984) suggest that examining the relationship between
various types of childhood adversity and low positive
affect may inform our understanding of how such
experiences impair functioning.
Physical abuse, sexual abuse, and family environ-
ment (e.g., childhood social support, neglect) have all
been associated with adulthood psychopathology (e.g.,
Edwards et al., 2003), and the strength of those associa-
tions can inform expectations about the relationships
between adversities and low positive affect. Relative to
some other early adversities, sexual abuse has been found
to be more predictive of poor psychological adjustment
in adulthood, PTSD symptoms, and negative affect
(Higgins & McCabe, 2000; Sullivan, Fehon, Andres-
Hyman, Lipschitz, & Grilo, 2006). Lower levels of
childhood social support, especially emotional and psy-
chological support, have been associated with PTSD,
emotional distress, depression, negative affect, externaliz-
ing symptoms, and lower levels of psychological wellbeing
(Lauterbach, Koch, & Porter, 2007; Sullivan et al., 2006).
The role of physical neglect is less clear because it so
often co-occurs with other types of early adversity.
Some evidence suggests that it may be less predictive of
PTSD, depressive, and dissociative symptoms than phy-
sical or sexual abuse (Wechsler-Zimring & Kearney, 2011).
Positive affect is an important aspect of psychological
functioning and wellbeing that is potentially affected by
these same early adversities.
The current study
Low positive affect is closely related to common patholo-
gical responses to childhood adversity, including PTSD
and depression, but little is known about how the
characteristics of early adversity experiences might be
related to positive affect in adulthood. Therefore, this
study examined how the number of types of abuse
experienced, severity of adversity types (physical abuse
and sexual abuse), childhood environment (childhood
social support, neglect, and caretaker dysfunction), and
number of non-abuse traumas are related to positive
affect. First, we hypothesized that lower positive affect

would be associated with multiple types of abuse (i.e., both
physical and sexual abuse). Second, we hypothesized that
sexual abuse would be more strongly related to low posi-
tive affect than physical abuse. Third, we expected that
lower positive affect would be related to lower levels
of childhood social support, higher levels of neglect,
higher levels of caretaker dysfunction, greater severity of
abuse, and more non-abuse traumas. Finally, we sought to
replicate earlier findings of associations between low
positive affect and other psychiatric symptoms.
Method
Participants and procedure
We conducted a secondary analysis of data collected from
psychiatric inpatients participating in a study examining
the relationship of childhood family environment, child-
hood abuse experiences, and adult traumatic stress with
current posttraumatic symptoms (Carlson et al., 2001).
A detailed description of the recruitment methods is
described elsewhere (Carlson et al., 2001). All patients
who were admitted to a large, nonprofit psychiatric hos-
pital over a period of 3.5 years were eligible to participate
in the study and patients were targeted for recruitment
as soon as approval from the admitting psychiatrist or
psychologist was obtained. Two hundred seventeen
adults participated in a structured clinical interview,
and data for all predictors were available for 173
participants. The majority of participants were female
(52%), and most participants reported their ethnicity as
Caucasian (78.6%) or African-American (18.7%). Mean
age was 37.7 years (SD05.0). Adult socio-economic
status (SES) was determined using Hollingshead's Two-
Factor Index of Social Position (Hollingshead & Redlich,
1958), which is based on education level and occupation
of the participant or the head of household (whichever
results in higher SES). In this sample, 8% of participants
were categorized as lower class, 29% as lower-middle
class, 26% as middle class, 27% as upper-middle class,
and 10% as upper class.
Psychiatric diagnoses were obtained from patient
charts. The most common diagnoses were mood dis-
orders, followed by substance use disorders (see Table 1).
Other data were collected through self-report measures
and private interviews by trained and supervised clinical
psychology graduate students who were not involved in
the participant's treatment.
Measures
Positive affect
Positive affect was assessed with two interviewer-
administered questions. First, participants responded to
an item describing their perceived capacity for positive
affect (``In general, over your whole life, how easy or hard
has it been for you to feel good or happy?'') on a 6-point
Likert scale (00extremely hard; 10very hard; 20a little
bit hard; 30fairly easy; 40very easy; 50extremely easy).
Second, participants responded to an item describing
their experience of positive affect (``In general, over your
whole life, how often have you felt good or happy?'') on
a 6-point Likert scale (00never; 10almost never;
20sometimes; 30fairly often; 40often; 50very often).
Summing the two item scores created an index of positive
affect capacity and frequency. Positive affect index scores
could range from 0 to 10. In this sample, the two items
were significantly correlated, r00.59, pB0.001.
Global psychopathology symptoms
The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R; Derogatis,
1983) was used to measure global psychopathology
symptoms. The SCL-90-R is a 90-item self-report ques-
tionnaire that measures nine psychiatric symptoms as
well as the overall degree of distress related to a symptom
with a 5-point scale (00not at all; 10a little bit; 20
moderately; 30quite a bit; 40extremely). Subscale scores
are averages of subscale items, and the Global Severity
Index represents global psychopathology symptoms by
averaging subscale scores. The SCL-90-R has been
well validated for use in psychiatric samples (Derogatis,
1983).
Depression symptoms
The Depression subscale of the SCL-90-R was used to
assess depression symptoms. Though this scale is in-
cluded in the SCL-90-R total score, it was included in
bivariate correlation analyses due to the specific associa-
tion between positive affect and depression in prior
research (Watson et al., 2005).
Dissociative symptoms
Dissociative symptoms were measured with the Dissocia-
tive Experiences Scale (DES; Bernstein & Putnam, 1986).
It is a 28-item self-report measure assessing the percen-
tage of time individuals experience amnesia, deper-
sonalization, derealization, absorption, and imaginative

involvement. The items are averaged for a total score, with
higher scores indicating more dissociative symptoms. The
DES is widely used and has strong psychometric proper-
ties (Carlson & Putnam, 1993; Waller, 1995).
Self-destructive behaviors
The Structured Interview of Self-Destructive Beha-
viors (SI-SDB; Carlson, McDade-Montez, Dalenberg,
Armstrong, & Loewenstein, 2013) assesses the lifetime
level of self-destructive behaviors of suicidality, self-injury,
risky sexual behaviors, disordered eating, and substance
abuse. Analyses of internal and external validity are
supportive of the validity of the measure (Carlson et al.,
2013). The interviewer rates the severity of impairment in
each domain, where 00none, 10mild, 20moderate, and
30severe. Scores for each domain are summed for a total
score ranging from 0 to 15.
PTSD symptoms
The Structured Interview for PTSD (SI-PTSD; Davidson,
Smith, & Kudler, 1989) rates the severity of the 17 symp-
toms of Criteria B, C, and D for PTSD in the DSM-IV-
TR. The SI-PTSD uses a screening item to identify a
traumatic event, and the interview is only completed if a
traumatic event is reported. For this reason, SI-PTSD
scores were available for 133 out of 173 participants. The
SI-PTSD has demonstrated good interrater and testÃ
retest reliability, as well as concurrent validity (Davidson
et al., 1989).
Childhood social support
Perceived childhood social support was assessed with a
measure created for the study, the Structured Interview
for Social Support as a Child (SI-SSC). The SI-SSC
assesses five types of support: self-esteem support, infor-
mational support, instrumental support, motivational
support, and listening support. Participants indicated
when and who provided the support, and the extent they
found this person helpful was rated from 0 to 3, where
00not at all, 10a little, 20somewhat, and 30very
much. Total scores were then calculated by averaging
across all five items, for a possible range of 0Ã3. The
SI-SSC has been shown to be reliable and valid (Carlson
et al., 2001).
Neglect
Neglect was assessed with five questions as part of a
structured interview, participants were asked whether
they experienced being sick with no one to care for
them, getting sick because of neglect, going without food
or water for a day or more, living away from home for
3 or more months, or living in foster care. Scores
represent how many of these types of experiences an
individual reported and could range from 0 to 5.
Caretaker dysfunction
As part of a structured interview about childhood
experiences, participants were asked with whom they
lived as children and who was responsible for their care,
up to five individuals. For each of these caretakers,
participants indicated whether that person had a mental
illness, had problems with drinking or alcohol abuse, had
ever attempted suicide, or had been violent with others
in the home. Scores represent how many of these issues
were endorsed and could range from 0 to 20.
Childhood sexual and physical abuse
Childhood sexual and physical abuse were assessed with
slightly modified versions of Jacobson's (1989; Jacobson
& Richardson, 1987) structured interviews for interper-
sonal violence and nonconsensual sexual experiences
which were based on the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS;
Straus, 1979). Participants were first asked ``When you
were a child, did anyone ever use physical force on you?''
Participants could identify up to four assailants, and for
each individual identified, interviewers asked structured
questions about 11 types of physical violence (e.g., ``Did
this person ever throw something at you?''), as well as the
frequency and duration of the incidents. The interview
followed a similar structure in assessing sexual abuse.
Participants endorsing the gate question (``When you
were a child, did anyone ever touch you in a sexual way
or do something sexual or weird that made you feel
uncomfortable?'') were asked about the frequency and
duration of 11 types of sexual experiences with up to four
individuals. The interview was structured and worded
to be specific and neutral to increase accuracy of recall.
The interview procedure used for this study is described
in greater detail elsewhere (Carlson et al., 2001).
Responses from these interviews were classified into
physical abuse or sexual abuse, and individuals were
categorized as having experienced No Abuse, Physical
Abuse Only, Sexual Abuse Only, or Both Abuse Types.
Physical abuse severity and sexual abuse severity scores
were calculated by summing the number of abuse ex-
periences within each category, with more severe incidents
(e.g., being burned or threatened with a weapon, sexual
penetration) counted as double. Scores on these variables
represent the number of experiences of these types of
abuse from up to four abusers, such that multiple types
of abuse on one occasion results in a higher score for
participants. The interview and scoring system used for
this study have demonstrated strong reliability and
validity through testÃretest reliability and convergent
validity analyses reported in the original publication
from this project (see Carlson et al., 2001).
Abuse scores were transformed to reduce distortion
by statistical outliers resulting from some participants
endorsing very high levels of abuse. We transformed these
scores using a 95th percentile Winsorization, in which

outliers beyond the 95th percentile are replaced with the
value at the 95th percentile. Winsorization retains all data
and their magnitudes and is more intuitively clear than
other procedures, such as common log transformations
(Sheskin, 2003).
Adulthood and childhood non-abuse trauma
The numbers of adulthood and childhood non-abuse
traumatic events were collected as part of the SI-PTSD
(Davidson et al., 1989). For this study, to avoid excluding
those who had high levels of trauma, but were unable to
provide exact numbers, the number of adulthood and
childhood non-abuse traumas reported during the inter-
view were coded into five categories where 000 traumas,
101 trauma, 202Ã3 traumas, 304Ã5 traumas, and 406
or more traumas.
Results
Descriptive and correlation analyses
Descriptive data for psychiatric symptoms and psycho-
social factors are presented in Table 2. Positive affect was
significantly negatively correlated with all other symptom
measures (see Table 3). Table 4 shows correlations among
positive affect, childhood environment (social support,
caretaker dysfunction, and neglect), childhood physical
abuse, childhood sexual abuse, childhood traumas, and
adult traumas. Positive affect was significantly related to
levels of childhood social support, caretaker dysfunction,
physical abuse, and sexual abuse, but not to neglect,
childhood non-abuse traumas, or adulthood non-abuse
traumas.
Effect of number of types of abuse
To test our hypotheses regarding the association between
type of abuse experienced and positive affect, an ANOVA
was conducted on positive affect scores with abuse type
(No Abuse, Physical Abuse Only, Sexual Abuse Only, Both
Abuse Types) as the independent variable. The number of
participants reporting each type of abuse and group means
is presented in Table 5. This ANOVA found signifi-
cant group differences, F(3,168)08.1, pB0.001. Post-
hoc comparisons with Bonferroni corrections showed
that those in the Both Abuse Types group had significantly
lower positive affect than those in the Physical Abuse Only
and No Abuse groups. No other significant differences
across groups were observed.
Effect of childhood adversity
To test the capacity of various types of childhood
adversity to predict positive affect, a hierarchical regres-
sion analysis was conducted predicting positive affect with
childhood environmental factors (social support, neglect,
and caretaker dysfunction) entered in Step 1, severity of
physical and sexual abuse entered in Step 2, and child-
hood and adulthood non-abuse traumas entered in Step 3.
The results are shown in Table 6.
Discussion
This study demonstrated that positive affect is signifi-
cantly negatively related to a number of psychiatric
symptoms and that childhood support and abuse experi-
ences are significant predictors of positive affect in adult
psychiatric inpatients. Individuals who experienced both
physical and sexual abuse reported significantly lower
positive affect than those with only physical or no abuse
experiences. Greater severity of sexual abuse and lower
childhood social support predicted lower positive affect,
above and beyond childhood neglect, caretaker dys-
function, physical abuse severity, and non-abuse trauma
experiences.
We found positive affect to be negatively correlated
with global psychopathology, depressive, dissociative,
self-destructive behavior, and PTSD symptoms. These
negative associations are consistent with the view that
low positive affect is a transdiagnostic symptom. Our
finding of associations with broad psychopathology may
be a result of our assessment of positive affect broadly
over the lifespan and measurement of a broad construct

Low positive affect and early adversity

(i.e., happiness), whereas other more nosological studies
measuring current affect have primarily associated low
positive affect with depression (Watson et al., 2005).
Positive affect is distinct from negative affect, such that
one may experience high or low levels of either, both, or
neither (Watson et al., 1995). Low positive affect, there-
fore, can cause distress and functional impairment inde-
pendently or in conjunction with negative affect. Low
positive affect may also increase vulnerability to psy-
chological disorders by impairing cognitive processes
involved in resilience to and recovery from nega-
tive psychological states (Andersen & Limpert, 2001;
Aspinwall, 1998; Forbes & Dahl, 2005; Frewen et al.,
2010).
The finding that individuals who experienced both
types of abuse reported lower positive affect partially
supported our hypothesis that multiple types of abuse
would be associated with lower positive affect than one
type or no abuse. This finding is also consistent with prior
research on other outcomes that indicates that individuals
who have experienced multi-type maltreatment may be
at risk for compromised psychological functioning (e.g.,
Green et al., 2010). Interestingly, individuals report-
ing only one abuse type did not differ significantly from
those reporting no abuse. However, the number of types
of abuse experienced is a relatively imprecise index of
severity of abuse, and the severity of the abuse in those
with only one abuse type may have been lower than in
those with more than one type.
The regression analyses sought to clarify the relation-
ship between positive affect and the type and severity of
early adversity. Severity of sexual abuse predicted sig-
nificant unique variance in positive affect above and
beyond childhood environment characteristics and non-
abuse trauma experiences, while severity of physical abuse
was not significantly predictive of positive affect. This
provides support to our hypothesis that sexual abuse
would be associated with lower positive affect and is
consistent with prior research indicating that sexual abuse
may be more pathogenic than physical abuse and with the
broader finding that sexual trauma is more pathogenic
than other interpersonal violence (Brewin, Andrews, &
Valentine, 2000; Higgins & McCabe, 2000).
Low positive affect was associated with lower child-
hood social support, greater neglect, and greater care-
taker dysfunction, consistent with our hypothesis and
with previous findings indicating that childhood experi-
ences are strong influences on later mental health (e.g.,
Green et al., 2010). Childhood social support was an
especially robust predictor of positive affect, so interven-
tions to foster a supportive environment for children may
help to mitigate the deleterious effects of early adversity
on positive affect. Along with family-focused interven-
tions, at-risk children may benefit from mentoring,

teacher-focused interventions, and nurturing extracurri-
cular activities that grow social support outside of a
family context.
Greater severity of abuse experiences, as measured by
the number of incidents of abuse, predicted lower posi-
tive affect. Prior research has repeatedly found greater
severity of traumatic experiences generally, and early
adversity experiences specifically, to be associated with
worse posttraumatic outcomes (Brewin et al., 2000;
Cloitre et al., 2009; Higgins, 2004), and these results
extend that line of research to a novel outcome*positive
affect. However, the number of non-abuse traumas was
not a significant predictor of positive affect in this study.
It is unlikely that the other predictors in the model
obscured the relationship between the number of traumas
and positive affect, as the zero-order correlation between
the two was comparatively small and not statistically
significant. Instead, these results seem to suggest that
childhood abuse experiences have a greater impact on
positive affect than non-abuse childhood traumas or
adult traumas. This finding is consistent with theory and
research on the differentially greater impact of early
interpersonal trauma (Cicchetti & Toth, 2005).
Potential mechanisms underlying the relationship ob-
served in this study between low childhood social support,
childhood sexual abuse, and low positive affect include
disruption of attachment processes, emotion regulation
difficulties and interactions with negative affect, and
alteration of psychobiological state. Childhood maltreat-
ment appears to be strongly associated with insecure
attachments (Cicchetti & Toth, 2005). More insecurely
attached individuals have been found to minimize posi-
tive experiences, and an avoidant attachment style
has been associated with social anhedonia (Gentzler,
Kerns, & Keener, 2010; Troisi, Alcini, Coviello, Nanni,
& Siracusano, 2010), which would likely reduce how
supportive individuals find social contacts and their like-
lihood of accessing social support. Furthermore, attach-
ment difficulties have been associated with difficulty
regulating negative affect (Cloitre, Stovall-McClough,
Zorbas, & Charuvastra, 2008). These emotion regulation
difficulties could interact with individuals' ability to
experience positive affect. Indeed, when individuals with
PTSD were presented with typically positive stimuli (e.g.,
the image of a sunny day), they experienced significantly
more negative affect than healthy controls (Frewen et al.,
2012). This negative affect interfered with their ability to
experience positive affect, contributing to individuals
with PTSD experiencing less overall positive affect. In
addition to these psychological consequences, attachment
problems may have biological impacts. Psychobiological
models have indicated that oxytocin, which is released
during pleasurable social contact, resulting in feelings of
reward, pleasure, and safety, plays a crucial role in positive
affect and the endocrine response to stressors (Olff, 2012).
Early negative emotional experiences and coping through
over-modulation of affect are thought to produce lasting
neurological alterations (Perry, Pollard, Blakely, Baker, &
Vigilante, 1995), so childhood experiences of low social
support may result in decreased oxytocin levels and
concomitant reduced positive affect.
Limitations
Limitations of the study include the potential for error in
individuals' recollection of childhood experiences and
reports of low positive affect. In an experience sampling
study of depressed patients, reports of anhedonia were
found to be negatively biased (Ben-Zeev & Young, 2010).
Additionally, current positive affect was not assessed so
that it could be differentiated from lifelong experience of
positive affect, and the reliability and validity of the
positive affect items have not been established. This study
was conducted with psychiatric inpatients, potentially

Low positive affect and early adversity

limiting generalizability to less impaired populations;
however, this study is notable for investigating positive
affect in individuals with a range of psychiatric diagnoses
and a range of childhood adversities. Future research
would benefit from developing more extensive measures
of lifetime positive affect and determining the relation-
ship between measures of state positive affect (e.g.,
PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) and lifetime
positive affect as measured here.
Conclusion
This study investigated the relationship between child-
hood adversity and positive affect in an adult psychiatric
inpatient sample. Individuals who experienced both
physical and sexual abuse as children reported lower
lifetime experience of positive affect and lower lifetime
capacity to experience positive affect than those with no
abuse experience and those who experienced only one
type of abuse. Sexual abuse severity was a particularly
strong predictor of positive affect. Given the role of
positive affect in psychological resilience, these results
suggest that victims of multiple types of early adversity,
especially those with sexual abuse experiences, may be at
risk for psychological difficulties. Given the strong
relationship between childhood social support and posi-
tive affect, interventions to foster social support may be
useful in treating these at-risk populations.
