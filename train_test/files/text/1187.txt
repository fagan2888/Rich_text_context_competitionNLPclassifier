Context: Although certain media exposures have been
linked to the presence of psychiatric conditions, few stud-
ies have investigated the association between media ex-
posure and depression.
Objective: To assess the longitudinal association be-
tween media exposure in adolescence and depression in
young adulthood in a nationally representative sample.
Design: Longitudinal cohort study.
Setting and Participants: We used the National Lon-
gitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to
investigate the relationship between electronic media ex-
posure in 4142 adolescents who were not depressed at
baseline and subsequent development of depression af-
ter 7 years of follow-up.
Main Outcome Measure: Depression at follow-up as-
sessed using the 9-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies­
Depression Scale.
Results: Of the 4142 participants (47.5% female and
67.0% white) who were not depressed at baseline and who
underwent follow-up assessment, 308 (7.4%) reported
symptoms consistent with depression at follow-up. Con-
trolling for all covariates including baseline Center for
Epidemiologic Studies­Depression Scale score, those re-
porting more television use had significantly greater odds
of developing depression (odds ratio [95% confidence in-
terval], 1.08 [1.01-1.16]) for each additional hour of daily
television use. In addition, those reporting more total me-
dia exposure had significantly greater odds of develop-
ing depression (1.05 [1.0004-1.10]) for each additional
hour of daily use. We did not find a consistent relation-
ship between development of depressive symptoms and
exposure to videocassettes, computer games, or radio.
Compared with young men, young women were less likely
to develop depression given the same total media expo-
sure (odds ratio for interaction term, 0.93 [0.88-0.99]).
Conclusion: Television exposure and total media expo-
sure in adolescence are associated with increased odds
of depressive symptoms in young adulthood, especially
in young men.

DEPRESSION IS THE LEADING
cause of nonfatal disabil-
ity worldwide.1 Because
onset of depression is
common in adolescence
and young adulthood,2,3 it coincides with
a pivotal period of physical and psycho-
logic development and can lead to poorer
psychosocial functioning, lower life and ca-
reer satisfaction, more interpersonal diffi-
culty, greater need for social support, more
comorbid psychiatric conditions, and in-
creased risk of suicide.4,5 Even after recov-
ery from an initial episode of depression, af-
fected young people frequently experience
substantialpsychosocialimpairmentandare
at increased risk of recurrence of episodes
of depression.4,5
The development of depression in ado-
lescence may be understood as a biopsy-
chosocial, multifactorial process influ-
enced by risk and protective factors
including temperament, genetic heritabil-
ity, parenting style, cognitive vulnerabil-
ity, stressors (eg, trauma exposure or pov-
erty), and interpersonal relationships.2,3,5-7
It is plausible that exposure to electronic
media may be one of the factors that in-
fluence development of depression. This
exposure is massive: when accounting for
multitasking, current adolescent media use
is estimated at 81/2 hours per day.8
There are many different mechanisms
by which media exposure may influence
development of depression (Figure 1).
In terms of the sheer volume of expo-
sure, adolescents who spend excessive time
engaging with media may not have as
much opportunity as their peers to culti-
vate protective experiences that require ac-
tive social, intellectual, or athletic engage-
ment.6,7,9,10 Related to this, excessive media

exposure often occurs at night and can displace sleep,
which is valuable for normal cognitive and emotional de-
velopment.11-14 It has also been suggested that early me-
dia exposure can interfere with optimal development of
executive function,15 potentially contributing to vulner-
ability to cognitive distortions that have been associated
with depression.16,17 It should also be noted, however, that
adolescents often use media in social settings, which may
offer a social outlet that protects against depression
(Figure 1).
Media content may also lead to depression more di-
rectly. Cultural messages transmitted through media may
affect other behaviors related to mental health such as eat-
ing disorders and aggressive behavior,18,19 and media ex-
posure may similarly contribute to development of depres-
sion through reinforcement of depressogenic cognitions.20
For example, certain electronic media exposures are satu-
rated with highly idealized characters and situations, and
constant comparison of one's self with these unattainable
images may result in depression.16,20-22 Related to this, me-
dia messages often contain simplistic stereotypical por-
trayals of sociodemographic factors such as sex, race/
ethnicity, sexual orientation, and occupation.23-27 Because
adolescence is an important time of self-definition, expo-
sure to such simplistic portrayals can interfere with nor-
mal identity development, potentially producing dyspho-
ria.28 Othermediaexposuresarehighlynegativeandanxiety
provoking,29-31 andrepeatedexposuretothesemessagesmay
engender a negative and fearful perception of the world,
which can also result in depression.16,17 In addition, me-
dia commonly used by adolescents contain multiple ref-
erences to risky behavior including substance use or abuse,
violence, and sex,32-37 and adolescents who engage in these
behaviors may come to regret them and become prone to
dysphoria.38-40
However, it should also be noted that exposure to cer-
tain media content might reduce the likelihood of de-
veloping depression.41,42 Humor, an important element
of entertainment, is frequently portrayed in television pro-
grams, popular songs, movies, and video games.36,43-45 Bio-
medical studies have shown that mirthful laughter can
reduce stress,46 and laughter therapy has emerged as a
possible therapeutic method.41 Humor has even been
found to be beneficial among depressed and terminally
ill patients.47,48 Life-affirming media messages may simi-
larly protect against depression.

ally have been cross-sectional and have focused on anxi-

ever, there is limited information about the relationship
between media exposure and future development of de-
pression in a nationally representative population.
The purpose of this study was to assess empirically
the association between electronic media exposure in ado-
lescence and subsequent development of depressive symp-
toms in young adulthood. Our a priori hypothesis was
that excessive volume of television viewing during the
adolescent years is associated with increased develop-
ment of depression in young adulthood. On the basis of
theoretical links between media use and depression as
described above, we further hypothesized that exposure
to television is more potent than exposure to videocas-
settes, computer games, or radio. Because of the known
preponderance of media images of girls and women with

in young men.
METHODS
SAMPLE
We analyzed the public-use data set from the National Longi-
tudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a longitudi-
nal study of a nationally representative sample of adolescents
conducted from September 1, 1994, to April 30, 2002. Wave 1
data, collected in 1995, included 6504 participants in grades 7
through 12 who were randomly selected from a larger nation-
ally representative sample to be interviewed in their homes. Of
those with valid wave 1 data, 4882 participants (75.1%) were
reinterviewed in their homes 7 years later (wave 3).
We excluded participants who did not have complete
depression data at baseline (n=18) or at follow-up (n=25).
Because we were interested in identifying incident develop-
ment of depression during the study period, we also
excluded those who were depressed at time 1 (n=697). Our
final study sample consisted of 4142 individuals who did not
report depression symptoms above threshold at baseline and
who had complete depression data at baseline and follow-
up. This represented 63.7% of the 6504 individuals inter-
viewed at baseline.
MEASURES
Depression
The Centers for Epidemiologic Studies­Depression Scale
(CES-D) consists of 20 items that have been successfully used
for screening and quantifying the severity of depression in gen-
eral populations, and shorter versions are commonly used.54,55
Nine CES-D items were included in baseline (wave 1) and 7-year
(wave 3) assessments in the Add Health study. We formed our
depression scale using all 9 items. These items asked respon-
dents how often in the last 7 days they had experienced spe-
cific depressive symptoms (Table 1). Each item was scored
on a scale of 0 to 3, corresponding to responses of "never or
rarely," "sometimes," "a lot of the time," and "most or all of
the time." We summed these responses to form depression scores
at each time point ranging from 0 (no symptoms of depres-
sion) to 27 (severe symptoms of depression). The 9-item de-
pression scale was internally consistent at baseline (Cronbach
=.79) and follow-up (Cronbach =.81).
Among adolescents, the complete 20-item CES-D scale
(range, 0-60) has strong predictive validity for depression at a
threshold score of 24 for female adolescents and 22 for male
adolescents.55 We scaled our cutoff scores on the basis of the
number of items in our scale, resulting in depression cutoff scores
of 11 or higher for female adolescents and 10 or higher for male
adolescents (scale range, 0-27). Others have used similar meth-
ods to define a threshold for depression when using Add Health
data.56,57
Media Exposure
At the Add Health baseline evaluation (wave 1), information
was collected about media exposure in 1995. Participants were
asked to report hours of exposure during the last week to each
of 4 types of electronic media: television, videocassettes (DVDs
were not widely introduced until 1997), computer games, and
radio. We analyzed exposure to each media type as a continu-
ous variable in hours per day. We also created a summary mea-
sure of media exposure equal to the sum of the hours per day
of exposure to each of the 4 media types.
Sociodemographic Covariates
The Add Health survey assessed relevant sociodemographic co-
variates known to be related to depression and/or media ex-
posure. Sex was self-reported. Age at follow-up was computed
on the basis of the participant's date of birth and date of in-
home survey. Race was self-reported as any combination of
white, African American, Asian, American Indian, and other.
Ethnicity was self-reported as Hispanic or not Hispanic. As a
proxy for socioeconomic status, we used maternal educa-
tional level (did not graduate from high school, graduated from
high school or received a general equivalency diploma, had fur-
ther education after high school but did not graduate from col-
lege, graduated from college but did not pursue further edu-
cation, or had an advanced or other degree). The survey also
included the participants' marital status and highest level of edu-
cational attainment at follow-up.
Methods of Analysis
To compare demographic and media use variables between par-
ticipants who did or did not exhibit depressive symptoms at
follow-up, we used t tests for continuous variables and 2 tests
for categorical variables. We used P.05 (2-tailed) to define
statistical significance for all analyses. We conducted these analy-
ses using wave 3 sampling weights.
We then used multiple logistic regression to assess the
independent association between each media exposure at
baseline and presence of depression at follow-up. We
applied sampling weights for wave 3 of the Add Health study
in all of our regression models. In addition to excluding all
participants who were depressed at time 1, we controlled for
baseline CES-D score in all analyses. We searched for inter-
action terms between media use variables and sex because
media use is strikingly different between male and female
users8 and because representation of male and female indi-
viduals in media are different.52 Participants with missing
data were not included in our analyses. This did not affect
our results because less than 2% of wave 3 participants had
missing data for this analysis.
Our primary models included all measured covariates. To
test the robustness of our results, we conducted all analyses using
stepwise backward logistic regression with criteria for re-
moval from the model of P.15.

RESULTS
SAMPLE
Of the 4142 participants who did not meet criteria for
depression at baseline and had complete depression data
for baseline and follow-up, 308 (7.4%) met symptom cri-
teria for depression at follow-up. Of all participants, 52.5%
were female; 23.7% were African American, and 10.3%
were Hispanic; and their mean (SD) age at follow-up was
21.8 (1.8) years. Most participants (84.6%) had achieved
at least a high school diploma, and 17.4% had been mar-
ried (Table 2).
MEDIA USE
Baseline mean (SD) daily media use was 5.68 (4.46) hours,
consisting of 2.30 (2.14) hours of television, 0.62 (0.96)
hours of videocassettes, 0.41 (0.94) hours of computer
games, and 2.34 (2.79) hours of radio (Table 2). Those
who were depressed at follow-up had watched more tele-
vision at baseline (2.64 vs 2.28 h/d) (Table 2 and
Figure 2A) but had not been exposed to more video-
cassettes, computer games, or radio (Table 2 and
Figure 2B).

able, these values indicate that, in each case, given the
same media exposures, there was a tendency for young
women to have lower odds of developing depression com-
pared with young men.
COMMENT
This study demonstrates that, in a nationally represen-
tative sample of adolescents, television and overall me-
dia exposure are associated with the development of de-
pressive symptoms in young adulthood, especially in
young men. These results held despite controlling with
multiple covariates, including baseline CES-D score. Ex-
posure to videocassettes, video games, and radio were not
associated with development of depression. The associa-
tion of certain media exposures in this study with the sub-
sequent presence of depressive symptoms is consistent
with the findings of others who have associated media
exposure with other mental health conditions.18,58
Of the various media exposures measured in the Add
Health study, we found television and overall media ex-
posure to be most closely linked to depression. These find-
ings are consistent with the hypothesis that excessive me-
dia exposure may detract from protective experiences or
lead to poor sleep. Among the 4 media exposures mea-
sured, television viewing is unique in that it consumes a
large amount of time,8 and participants who had the high-
est levels of baseline television exposure were most likely
to develop depression (Figure 2A). Although radio expo-
sure is also large, it more commonly is present in the back-
ground and frequently accompanies other activities.8
However, the finding that television was the medium
most strongly associated with the development of de-
pression in young adulthood is also consistent with the
hypothesis that the specific content of certain media may
lead to depression. For example, television contains more
advertising than either videocassettes or computer games,
and advertisements are often designed to make the viewer
believe that he or she requires a certain product or life-
style to feel adequate.59 Although radio also contains ad-
vertising, the combined visual and aural experience of
television may be more effective and compelling.60
Another difference between videocassettes and televi-
sion is that content on videocassettes is generally specifi-
callychosenbytheviewer,whereastelevisionismorelikely
tobeprovidedbydefault(ie,channelsurfing).31 Television
also contains the most compelling and dramatic news re-
ports, many of which are anxiogenic,49,50 and repeated ex-
posure to these messages may lead not only to anxiety but
also to depression.3,16 Television also seems to contain the
most stereotyping among media messages.25,26,61,62
In general, television is no more likely than other me-
dia such as movies or music to contain risk-taking behav-
ior.33,35,36 Thus, our results suggest that the mechanism by
which media exposure may influence development of de-
pressionisrelatedtoacombinationoffactorsincludingdis-
placement of protective experiences, poor sleep, self-
comparison with unattainable images, stereotyping, and
anxiety-provoking content.
Although we did not find that overall exposure to any
of these types of media was associated with less depres-
sion, this does not rule out the hypothesis that certain
humorous or life-affirming media exposures may re-
duce the likelihood of depression.41,42 Because we were
not able to differentiate specific exposures, certain ex-
posures still may be beneficial to some. However, it is
noteworthy that this study shows that total television and
total media exposure are associated with an increase, not
a reduction, in depression.
It was an interesting and unexpected finding that young
women did not exhibit a stronger association between
media exposure and development of depression. In-
deed, they had significantly lower odds of developing de-
pression in the model involving total media exposure.
Men and women use different coping mechanisms when
dealing with depression; women are more likely to in-
ternalize and ruminate about their condition, whereas men
are more likely to engage in externalizing or distracting
activities.63,64 Similarly, adolescent girls may develop closer
and more intimate social ties than their male counter-

parts, giving them more social reserve than adolescent
boys.63,64 Thus, whereas adolescent girls may be more
likely to seek comfort from peers, parents, or profession-
als, adolescent boys may use distractions such as televi-
sion and other media to cope with underlying subsyn-
dromal depression until different stressors and demands
emerge later in life, leading to more substantial symp-
toms of depression. Thus, excessive time devoted to me-
dia may affect male users more substantially.4,22,65,66
It is also possible that actual media content may have
more of a detrimental effect on male psychologic devel-
opment than has been previously appreciated. The domi-
nant fiction of idealized masculinity and sex roles to which
boys are exposed while watching television may rein-
force feelings of marginalization and worthless-
ness.22,67,68 The depressogenic media exposure in com-
bination with preexisting negative cognitions may make
unpopular or rejected boys feel even more outcast. Fu-
ture research may explore questions such as these by ex-
amining moderating effects of other factors such as
strength of interpersonal relationships on the link be-
tween media use and depression.
These findings have implications for clinicians work-
ing in a variety of fields. Psychiatrists, pediatricians, fam-
ily physicians, internists, and other health care provid-
ers who work with adolescents may find it useful to ask
their patients about television and other media expo-
sure. When high amounts of television or total expo-
sure are present, a broader assessment of the adoles-
cent's psychosocial functioning may be appropriate,
including screening for current depressive symptoms and
for the presence of additional risk factors. If no other im-
mediate intervention is indicated, encouraging patients
to participate in activities that promote a sense of mas-
tery and social connection may promote the develop-
ment of protective factors against depression.
Helping children at risk of depression to bolster so-
cial support and involvement in activities is routine for
child psychiatrists and other mental health profession-
als who work with adolescents; however, these clini-
cians may also want to consider an assessment of tele-
vision exposure as a marker of vulnerability to the
development of depressive symptoms. Further research
will be necessary to understand how television expo-
sure may correlate with the development of depressive
symptoms in psychiatric clinical populations or with the
clinical course of diagnosed depression. At the popula-
tion level, as our understanding of the links between the
mass media and adolescent depression become further
refined, prevention programs may wish to incorporate
these research findings into educational efforts aimed at
adolescents and their families.
Our study was limited in that we relied on self-report
of media exposure. Although self-report of media habits
is subject to recall bias, it is currently standard practice in
research of this type when it is not feasible to use recog-
nition measures.37,69,70 It should also be noted that our in-
dependent variables were based on a single point estimate
of media exposure, and there is no assurance that this re-
mained stable over time. It is also disappointing that the
baseline survey did not assess Internet exposure; how-
ever, this is a known limitation of the Add Health survey.
Insofar as the dependent variable, the Add Health study
included only 9 items from the CES-D at follow-up, pre-
venting us from using the complete 20-item scale. How-
ever, Add Health personnel carefully selected these par-

ticular 9 items because of their excellent face validity for
adolescents and based on psychometric testing that
showed that they represented the vast majority of the vari-
ance in the complete 20-item scale. Another limitation
of the CES-D in general is its lack of specificity; for ex-
ample, it tends to detect anxiety and depression.
It should be emphasized that, although our study
showed a longitudinal association between media expo-
sure in adolescence and development of depressive symp-
toms at later follow-up, this association does not neces-
sarily imply causality. For example, it may be that
adolescents with preexisting vulnerability to later devel-
oping depression are differentially attracted to watch-
ing television, perhaps owing to behavioral inhibition or
aversive interpersonal and family relationships.
In conclusion, the present study breaks new ground
in linking media use in adolescence to the development
of depressive symptoms in young adulthood, especially
relative to television exposure and overall media use.
The study also highlights a previously unappreciated
potential vulnerability to media exposure in male ado-
lescents in particular. Its longitudinal design and large
nationally representative sample are important
strengths. Despite this study's limitations, these findings
suggest important directions for future research and
interventions with the goal of reducing the massive toll
of depression.
