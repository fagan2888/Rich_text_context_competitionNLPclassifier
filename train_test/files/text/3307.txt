Commentary
Over the past several years, funders of research around the
world have issued a call for broad and open data sharing to
extend scientific findings and encourage new science.
Indeed, many disciplines have found that data sharing,
especially when enabled through formal data archiving,
results in greater numbers of publications based on the data
(Pienta, Alter, & Lyle, 2010; Piwowar, Day, & Fridsam,
2007). But data sharing is not yet firmly established in all
disciplines and countries, and it can be especially challeng-
ing for research conducted in middle- and low-income
countries where the culture of data sharing is just beginning
to gain traction. The articles in this issue discuss attitudes
toward data sharing in Kenya, India, Vietnam, South Africa,
and Thailand and serve to highlight the salient challenges
surrounding data sharing in countries with limited resources.
At the same time the articles touch on the potential ben-
efits of making data available for reuse. Widely acknowl-
edged benefits cited in the articles include the generation of
evidence that might lead to positive interventions for the
local populations, increased transparency and accountabil-
ity, avoidance of duplication of effort, and encouragement
of learning (Hate et al., 2015). The opportunity for reputa-
tional benefits to accrue to the researcher and research
group was another impetus for sharing data (Cheah et al.,
2015).
Although these benefits were seen as compelling by the
stakeholders interviewed, the complications involved in
sharing data openly and actually putting transparency prin-
ciples into practice often appeared daunting and seemed to
outweigh the advantages. Some common themes emerged
as communities wrestled with data sharing requirements.
Most of the authors acknowledged the potential for exploi-
tation of the local population and other forms of harm that
might affect research participants, including loss of privacy.
Most also cited issues around informed consent, including
questions about the rights of research subjects and potential
benefits to the local community (Denny, Silaigwana,
Wassenaar, Bull, & Parker, 2015; Jao et al., 2015; Merson
et al., 2015). Other barriers included the time and effort it
takes to make data ready for sharing, and the lack of per-
ceived validation and recognition for researchers and the
research team for their efforts. All mentioned the need for
policies, frameworks, and examples related to data sharing
as clear paths to follow were often lacking.
Fortunately, as a result of recent open access mandates,
the global research community is devoting substantial
thought to guidance in the area of data sharing, and we are
seeing some positive examples of data sharing practices and
procedures that can be emulated. One such example,
described in this issue of the Journal of Empirical Research
on Human Research Ethics, is the International Network for
the Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their

Addressing Global Data Sharing Challenges
George C. Alter1 and Mary Vardigan1
Abstract
This issue of the Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics highlights the ethical issues that arise when
researchers conducting projects in low- and middle-income countries seek to share the data they produce. Although
sharing data is considered a best practice, the barriers to doing so are considerable and there is a need for guidance and
examples. To that end, the authors of this article reviewed the articles in this special issue to identify challenges common
to the five countries and to offer some practical advice to assist researchers in navigating this "uncharted territory," as
some termed it. Concerns around informed consent, data management, data dissemination, and validation of research
contributions were cited frequently as particularly challenging areas, so the authors focused on these four topics with the
goal of providing specific resources to consult as well as examples of successful projects attempting to solve many of the
problems raised.

Health (INDEPTH), a global network of research centers in
Africa, Asia, and Oceania that has established a data reposi-
tory to enable sharing of fully documented, high-quality
data sets (Herbst et al., 2015). The INDEPTH approach pro-
vides solutions to some of the widely encountered barriers
to data sharing.
Our organization, the Inter-University Consortium for
Political and Social Research (ICPSR), has addressed many
of these challenges over the course of its 50+ year history,
and in providing access to social and behavioral science
data to researchers and instructors around the world, we
have learned what works and what does not and which
types of resources are the most helpful to promote data
sharing. Although we cannot say we have solved all of the
problems raised in this issue, we have achieved some good
outcomes and seek to share that experience to support oth-
ers in moving forward with data sharing. We believe that
openness and data sharing ultimately lead to better science,
and thus our observations are oriented toward providing
access as widely as possible.
In this article, we take up some of the barriers noted by the
authors in this issue, in order of their occurrence in the
research data life cycle: informed consent, data management,
data dissemination, and validation of contributions. We pro-
vide comments and suggestions which we hope are of value
to colleagues in low- and middle-income countries as they
address the challenges during these phases of the work. We
close with sections on best practices and educational implica-
tions and offer relevant resources for further review.
Informed Consent
Issues around the consenting process arose in all of the arti-
cles, and indeed, this is a critical component of health
research with many associated ethical dimensions. The
Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences
(CIOMS), in collaboration with the World Health
Organization, provides a published set of International
Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving
Human Subjects, which are recognized as universally appli-
cable. These 21 guidelines, developed and revised over sev-
eral decades, constitute an excellent foundational resource
for researchers in low-resourced countries. According to the
guidelines, informed consent processes involve three key
features: (a) disclosing to potential research subjects infor-
mation needed to make an informed decision; (b) facilitat-
ing the understanding of what has been disclosed; and (c)
promoting the voluntariness of the decision about whether
or not to participate in the research. Ensuring that the
informed consent process fulfills these requirements can go
a long way toward mitigating problems that arise, but the
need for sufficient detail in addressing each component of
the process is paramount. With respect to the third feature,
for example, what if a participant opts into the study but
wants to retract data later? Prospective research participants
need a clear explanation of when in the course of the study
they can opt out. The consent statement must include suffi-
cient detail to engender trust in the process.
Similarly, several of the articles indicated the need for
clarity around benefits to the community from whom data
were collected: How will the community benefit from the
research? Will specific interventions be implemented as a
result of the research? Clarity around the purpose and likely
outcome of the data collection is essential. To this point, the
CIOMS (2002) Guidelines state that
[I]n general, the research project should leave low-resource
countries or communities better off than previously or, at least,
no worse off. It should be responsive to their health needs and
priorities in that any product developed is made reasonably
available to them, and as far as possible leave the population in
a better position to obtain effective health care and protect its
own health.
Some research is undertaken with the express goal of ben-
efiting a community. Phillips, Nyonator, Jones, and
Ravikumar (2008) describe how research programs in Ghana
and Bangladesh produced results that were scaled up to
national public health interventions. Communities in research
projects may receive greater attention from medical person-
nel and earlier implementation of life-saving technologies,
and they may benefit in indirect ways as well, such as gaining
a sense of usefulness. In general, making the data as open as
possible encourages more science and provides more oppor-
tunities for communities to learn about themselves.
Another important point to keep in mind when develop-
ing the consent process is making sure that the agreement
permits data sharing after the data are collected. ICPSR has
developed specific guidance on this topic to help research-
ers with language that protects and respects the confidenti-
ality of participants and yet allows for sharing of the
resulting data with the broader scientific community
(ICPSR, n.d.-a).
Commercialization of research findings is often seen as
a threat to research participants who believe they should
share in any financial gain, and this was touched on in the
articles. There is a tension between academically oriented
science, which rewards researchers for openness, publica-
tion and priority of discovery, and commercially oriented
R&D, which views information as proprietary (David,
2014). However, the boundary between academic and com-
mercial research is often blurred, and private firms often
finance vital studies. Participants in research studies have a
right to know whether the data that they provide will be
open or limited for commercial reasons. Again, researchers
should be clear about how and with whom data will be
shared and the likely outcomes of the study at the time of
consent.
Alter and Vardigan 319
Data Management
Authors of the articles emphasize the amount of time and
work that is required to make data ready for deposit and
sharing, including the effort involved in preparing com-
prehensive documentation. This work is critical because
a data set should be documented well enough for a poten-
tial analyst to understand and interpret it effectively
without consulting the original data collector. At ICPSR,
we have found that if data are managed well from the
start of the project and active data curation and documen-
tation take place as the data set comes into existence, the
need for intensive work just before sharing is greatly
decreased.
The case of the INDEPTH program is also instructive
here. INDEPTH is making great strides in equipping data
managers with resources to manage and document data
across the data life cycle. The resources include the
Nesstar Publisher (n.d.) software, a metadata markup
tool that creates structured documentation according to
the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI; n.d.) standard.
Using Nesstar Publisher, one can document data at both
the study and variable levels efficiently, and because the
markup is standardized, interoperability is enabled. The
actual data set production for INDEPTH takes place dur-
ing joint data management workshops attended by data
managers and analysts from the participating INDEPTH
sites where common data processing procedures are
applied and data quality metrics are calculated. Data are
also evaluated for disclosure risk during these sessions.
This kind of collaborative work leads to higher data
quality.
This attention to metadata is the result of a concerted
INDEPTH policy, which was necessary because many
projects in low- and middle-income countries have diffi-
culty managing and documenting the data that they col-
lect. Data management and documentation are actually
universal challenges, and support for these activities has
traditionally been difficult to secure. Indeed, many
respondents in the studies on data sharing asked how they
could access resources to enable them to manage data
appropriately.
We believe strongly that sponsors should pay for good
data management from the beginning and not just for the
cost of collecting the data, as the INDEPTH example dem-
onstrates. Sponsors need to be cognizant that if data are not
adequately stewarded and curated, they may not be share-
able, and the potential for further research to benefit the
community as well as their initial investment in the data
will be lost. Research sponsors should be more assertive
about requiring data management plans that include
resources for documenting, preserving, and sharing the data
that they are funding. Active curation is the best way to
maximize sponsors' investment in the data.
Data Dissemination
Authors of the articles in this issue indicate that some
research participants feared that their data would end up in
the wrong hands and harm would come to them as a result.
This is understandable as data sharing is not yet common-
place and trust in such processes is established slowly. The
informed consent pledge can address some of this trepida-
tion by providing assurance that investigators will take
every effort to protect individual identities. In addition,
most of the authors recommended some type of controlled
access to the final data rather than completely open access.
ICPSR takes the risk of disclosure of individual identities
in data very seriously, and the organization has developed a
significant strength in this area. In particular, we have
defined procedures for de-identifying/anonymizing data to
create public-use files for wide access (ICPSR, 2012). These
procedures generally involve data masking and recoding,
which are undertaken in consultation with the original inves-
tigator. When it is not possible to create a public-use file
because the analytic potential of the data set will be compro-
mised, ICPSR has developed alternative means of providing
access to the data. These include a spectrum of solutions
from secure data download with a legal agreement on data
use to analysis in a virtual data enclave to highly restricted
access in an on-site physical data enclave at ICPSR. The
important thing is for the level of data sensitivity to be
matched with the appropriate dissemination mechanism
(ICPSR, n.d.-b). These sorts of controlled-access solutions
may be of interest for research programs in middle- and low-
income countries, and we provide a range of options below.
Open Access
Except for attribution of origin, no conditions or prior reg-
istration are applicable to the use of the data. At ICPSR,
many government-funded studies are available without
registration.
Licensed Access
Data repositories often require users to register and agree to
terms of use, which may prohibit re-identification of sub-
jects and redistribution of the data.
Restricted Licensed Access
When the risk of disclosing confidential information is
small but not negligible, data repositories often require data
use agreements with additional safeguards. Prospective
data users must submit data security plans and agree not to
publish tables or statistics that might disclose confidential
information. The data are transferred to the user in a secure
way after agreements have been approved and signed.
320 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 10(3)
Secure Remote Access
When data are highly sensitive or individually identifiable,
data repositories now use technologies to limit the risk of
data disclosure. Remote execution systems allow researchers
to submit program code, which is run by staff at the reposi-
tory. Virtual data enclaves allow users to work on a computer
at the repository using secure remote access technologies. In
both cases, the repository staff reviews output before it is sent
to the user, and the data never leave the repository.
Data Enclaves
The most sensitive data are available to prospective users
only through controlled on-site access at an approved data
center.
Although access restrictions are applied to protect confi-
dential data, metadata describing sensitive data are nor-
mally available online to allow researchers to discover the
data. Documentation rarely poses a risk to subjects, and the
ICPSR online catalog (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsr-
web/ICPSR/index.jsp) includes study descriptions and vari-
able information describing restricted data. Sometimes
documentation includes copyrighted instruments, such as
batteries of questions, and care must be taken to protect
those rights.
Validation of Research Contributions
Concerns were expressed in the articles that researchers
might not receive appropriate recognition for their work,
either because data sets were not considered of the same aca-
demic caliber as research articles or because researchers who
shared their data might be "scooped" by others who could
publish first on a given topic. Fortunately, while treating data
sets as first-class intellectual objects, akin to articles in peer-
reviewed journals, is a relatively new idea, it has gathered
momentum quickly over the past few years. Increasingly,
there is a call for data to be part of the promotion and tenure
process as well, on a par with peer-reviewed articles.
The key to providing recognition to data producers is
citation. Journals should cite data in a consistent manner
identifying the data producer and the location where the
data are accessible. This requires cooperation of a number
of parties. Data producers should put their data in reposito-
ries that provide curation and preservation services.
Repositories should assign and display a recommended
citation for the data. Journals should require authors to cite
data and provide guidelines with examples of appropriate
formats. Authors should include data citations that conform
to journal guidelines.
An important step toward data citation was the establish-
ment in 2010 of an international organization called DataCite
(n.d.), which has encouraged the citation of data and has
developed a system of registering persistent identifiers for
data.1 Another international organization called Force11
(n.d.) has developed a set of eight Data Citation Principles
that have been endorsed by more than 90 organizations.
Recently, a meeting organized by the Berkeley Initiative for
Transparency in the Social Sciences, SCIENCE Magazine,
and the Center for Open Science produced "Guidelines for
Transparency and Openness Promotion in Journal Policies
and Practices" (Center for Open Science, 2015). The first
section of the guidelines provides advice to journals on data
citation standards.
As journals move to new requirements for access to data
used in publications, there is general agreement that
researchers who create new data have a legitimate expecta-
tion to publish before the data are shared. Most journals and
professional associations require that data are accessible at
the time of publication, but some allow an "embargo"
period of up to a year. Data repositories, such as ICPSR, are
willing to delay the release of data for a reasonable amount
of time.
Best Practice Examples
We are now seeing significant and rapid transformations of
the research data landscape, prompting the need to share
knowledge and resources globally to support our common
endeavor. We provide here two examples related to promot-
ing data sharing in low- and middle-income countries.
International Household Survey Network (IHSN)
The IHSN (n.d.) is an informal network of international
agencies that operates solely on the basis of voluntary con-
tributions from its members. The IHSN seeks to develop
and disseminate guidelines, standards, and best practices
related to all stages of survey implementation: survey plan-
ning and integration, survey methods and assessments, data
curation, survey cataloguing, and microdata dissemination.
A virtual secretariat, comprised of members of the World
Bank, Development Data Group (WB-DECDG), and
PARIS21 Consortium Secretariat, coordinates the IHSN
and is responsible for the day-to-day management and
administration of the IHSN work program.
The IHSN does not provide technical or financial sup-
port, but coordinates its activities with the Accelerated Data
Program (ADP; n.d.), which supports the implementation
of international best practices of survey design and data
archiving in low- and middle-income countries. The ADP
was launched in 2006 as a recommendation of the Marrakech
Action Plan for Statistics (MAPS) to undertake urgent
improvements in survey programs for monitoring the
Millennium Development Goals. The ADP supports data
producers and users in developing countries by helping
Alter and Vardigan 321
them make better use of existing data and aligning survey
programs and statistical outputs to priority data needs. The
ADP concentrates on sample household surveys, which
provide estimates of many key outcome indicators, as well
as data needed for research and impact evaluation. TheADP
is increasingly focusing on other types of unit-level data,
including censuses and administrative data. The ADP takes
advantage of tools and guidelines developed or provided by
the IHSN and is currently supporting agencies in more than
60 countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America,
and the Caribbean. The IHSN provides a portal to useful
guidelines related to all stages of survey implementation.
An ICPSR Partnership for Data Archiving
ICPSR is exploring ways to support colleagues in less well-
resourced countries in promoting data sharing. Recently, we
worked with the Centre for Data Archiving, Management,
Analysis and Advocacy (C-DAMAA) at the University of
Cape Coast (UCC) in Ghana. With funding from the
University of Michigan'sAfrican Social Research Initiative,
ICPSR partnered with DataFirst (n.d.), a data service at the
University of Cape Town in South Africa, to advise and
train staff at C-DAMAA. University of Michigan funding
made it possible for SamuelAnnim, Director of C-DAMAA,
to attend workshops at ICPSR in the summer of 2014 and to
work with ICPSR staff on archiving data sets produced by
UCC faculty, which are available in a C-DAMAA series
(http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/346)
in the ICPSR data catalog. During the winter of 2015,
ICPSR sent a staff person to UCC to train C-DAMAA staff
to use ICPSR systems for data curation. Lynn Woolfrey,
manager of DataFirst, was particularly helpful in advising
C-DAMAA about establishing productive relationships
with government administrative and statistical agencies.
ICPSR staff are currently developing a resource guide to
help new data centers to understand the policies and pro-
cesses needed for a data archive. This guide will be avail-
able in Fall 2015 in the form of an online presentation with
a rich set of links to useful resources.
Sustaining Data Repositories
As noted above, the best way to increase the benefits from
data collection is to make data and thorough documentation
available to other researchers. Trusted data repositories play
a critical role in assuring that data remain accessible and
available for future generations of scholars. A key challenge
here is the cost of archiving data and the lack of sustainable
business models for this activity. Sponsors and journals are
increasingly requiring data sharing, but funding to ensure
that data are adequately managed and preserved is often
lacking. Some countries devote national funding for this
purpose, but in others data repositories are left to fend for
themselves often at the mercy of grant funding cycles,
which do not assure sustained funding. There is concern in
biomedical circles that some valuable databases have
already been lost because funding ended.
Several groups--including the Research Data Alliance,
the Center for Open Science, and professional associations,
to name a few--are grappling with this issue, but many dis-
ciplines and communities do not have strategies for keeping
data available. Recently, with support from the Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation, ICPSR convened a meeting of 25 domain
repositories to discuss the pressing need for innovative
funding models for repositories. The group issued a Call for
Change (ICPSR, 2013) and a white paper "Sustaining
Domain Repositories for Digital Data" (Ember & Hanisch,
2013) to focus attention on sustaining repositories. We
invite our colleagues from around the world to endorse the
Call for Change to make sure that data resources are not
lost.
Educational Implications
This article highlights the need for education and training in
various aspects of data stewardship. There is also a need for
complementary capacity building as groups begin to put
their knowledge into practice. Training should be available
in a variety of formats and venues to ensure the widest dis-
persion of knowledge.
ICPSR provides a series of Webinars, many of which
relate to data management and stewardship, and we main-
tain a YouTube channel for on-demand access to the
Webinars. There are other online training resources avail-
able, including DataONE's Education Modules (https://
www.dataone.org/education-modules) and the University
of Edinburgh's MANTRA training tool (http://datalib.
edina.ac.uk/mantra/). Online training can be offered rela-
tively cheaply, and Webinars can be recorded for later
viewing.
As part of its Summer Program in Quantitative Methods
of Social Research, ICPSR offers week-long courses on
data management for reuse. ICPSR's sister archives in
Europe, which belong to the Consortium of European Social
Science Data Archives, also offer such training. But we
need more programs such as INDEPTH and IHSN to pro-
vide training where data are being collected.
Conclusion
While global health inequalities make data sharing espe-
cially challenging, at heart the concerns raised by research-
ers and community members in low- and middle-income
countries are very familiar. We encounter the same ques-
tions when we speak to research communities in the United
States and other countries. Data archives have policies, pro-
cedures, and technologies responding to these concerns,
322 Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics 10(3)
and we are committed to sharing what we have learned.
When research projects plan for data sharing, they can
design their plans with respect for research subjects and
with appropriate protections for the confidential informa-
tion entrusted to them. After more than 50 years as a data
archive, we at ICPSR are fully convinced that data sharing
is one of the most effective ways to advance scientific
research and to assure that the benefits derived from
research data are realized as widely as possible.

George C. Alter is the director of the Inter-university Consortium
for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), professor of history at
the University of Michigan, and research professor in the
Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan. His
research interests include the history of the family, demography,
and economic history. He is particularly interested in methods for
reconstructing and analyzing life histories from longitudinal data.
He has recently participated in two cross-national comparative
projects: the "Eurasia Project" examines demographic responses
to economic stress in five societies in Europe and East Asia, and
the "Early Life Conditions" project asks whether experiences in
childhood have long-run effects on health in old age.
Mary Vardigan is an assistant director and archivist at the ICPSR.
She directs the ICPSR Collection Delivery Unit, which involves
oversight of activities in the areas of metadata, publications, web-
site development, user support, and membership development.
She also serves as director of the Data Documentation Initiative
(DDI), a project to establish a metadata standard for the social and
behavioral sciences. She is involved in other international projects
