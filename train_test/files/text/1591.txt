Mortality trends for Hodgkin disease in the United States
were examined from 1979 to 1988with the use of mortal-
ity data for multiple causes of death, which were ob-
tained from the National Center for Health Statistics. A
progressive decrease in the death rate from Hodgkin dis-
ease was observed over this period. The decrease in death
rate was greatest among white patients. Patients who
were 55 years or older had the highest death rate. Analy-
sis by geographic region showed decreases in each of the
regions, with no significant difference among groups of
states with high and low incidences of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. However, the decrease in the South
was approximately 35% greater than that in the North-
east. In 1988the most significant difference in death rates
between male and female patients was in the 35-54-year
age group, whereas a significant difference in death rates
between white and black patients was seen only in pa-
tients who were 55 years of age or older. In summary,
although there has been a significant reduction in deaths
resulting from Hodgkin disease between 1979 and 1988,
the decreases observed have varied between sexes and
among age groups, racial groups, and geographic regions.

First described in 1832,Hodgkin diseaseis distinct from
all other malignant lymphomas and is diagnosed in ap-
proximately 7400 patients in the United States an-
nually.',2 The incidence is higher in men than in
women, and higher in white than in black people.'
Epidemiologicstudies have suggested there may be
three distinct forms of Hodgkin disease: a childhood
form (in patients from 0 to 14years old), a young adult
form (in patients from 15 to 34 years old), and an older
adult form (in patients from 55 to 74 years Be-
cause of the epidemiologiccharacteristicsof these three
forms, it has been suggested that Hodgkin disease may
have several different origins.'r3A bimodal distribution
of age at diagnosis also has been described, with the
first peak seen in the 20-24-year age group and the
second peak in the 75-79-year age group.',3This latter
observation is also suggestive of separate disease pro-
cesses with different causes.'f3
Geographic epidemiologicstudies have shown that
a North-South gradient exists within the United States
in which the death rate from Hodgkin disease has been
greater in the North as compared with the S o ~ t h . ~ , ~
This
differential death rate has been seen only in the young
adult f ~ r r n . ~ , ~
A North-South gradient also has been
described in Japan,but the death rate was higher in the
South.'
Because much of this older epidemiologicliterature
does not reflect the lifesaving benefits of recent thera-
peutic breakthroughs, we analyzed Hodgkin disease
mortality trends and epidemiologiccharacteristicsfrom
1979 to 1988in the United States.
Methods
Mortality data for multiple causes of death in the
United States from 1979 to 1988 were obtained from
the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for
Disease Control.6Hodgkin disease deaths were defined
Hodgkin Disease MortalitylHooper et al. 1167
as those in which codes 201.0-201.9, by the lnterna-
tional Classificationof Disease, ninth re~ision,~,~
were re-
corded as any one of the multiple causes of death. To
examine Hodgkin disease deaths associated with the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or ac-
quired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1988,
categories 042-044 by this classification were used.
Annual Hodgkin disease death rates for the United
States were calculated as the number of Hodgkin dis-
ease deaths per 1,000,000 persons, based on estimates
of the United Statesresident p~pulation.~,~
Annual mor-
tality rates were calculated by age group, sex, race, and
region. Risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were
calculated to compare death rates." Age-adjusted
death rates were calculated and showed virtually no
effect on comparisons. Therefore, unadjusted mortality
rates are presented. The significancelevel was less than
or equal to 0.05.
To characterize the demographic data, age groups
were categorized as 0-14 years, 15-34 years, 35-54
years, and 55 years or older, and race was defined as
white, black, and other. Geographic comparisons were
analyzed with standard census regions: Northeast,
North Central region, West, and South. Comparisons
were made between the Hodgkin disease death rates
for states with high and low AIDS incidences." The
states with high AIDS incidences included California,
Florida, New Jersey,New York, and the District of Co-
lumbia; 21 states had low AIDS incidences.
Results
Mortality Trends: 1979-1988
From 1979through 1988,24,448 deaths from Hodgkin
disease were reported in the data for multiple causes of
death. The annual death rate for Hodgkin disease de-
creased from 11.4/1,000,000 persons in 1979 to 9.0/
1,000,000persons in 1988 (Table 1, Fig. 1).
The annual death rate for male patients was signifi-
cantly higher than that for female patients. For patients
of both sexes,rates decreased significantly from 1979to
1988 (Table 1). The decrease in death rate for white
patients exceeded those for black patients and patients
of other races.
By age group, the 0-14-year group had the largest
decrease in death rate; however, death as associated
with Hodgkin disease is least common in this age
group. The group of patients who were 55 years or
older, who had the highest death rate, had a significant
decrease (25.8%)(Table 1,Fig. 1).The rates for the 15-

Analysis of different geographic regions showed a
decrease in mortality rate in each region between the
years 1979and 1988(Fig. 1).The decreases were great-
est in the South and West.
Mortality Characteristics: 1988
In the multiple-cause data, 2205 Hodgkin disease
deaths during 1988 were reported. The death rate for
male patients was significantly higher than that for fe-
male patients (Table 2). The rate also was higher for
white than for black patients (riskratio = 1.6;95% con-
fidence interval = 1.4, 1.8).
Age-specific rates showed an increase in death rate
with age in both male and female patients (Table 3),
with a significantly higher rate among those who were
55 years or older than in the other age groups. The
significant difference in Hodgkin disease death rates
between male and female patients occurred in the pa-

tients who were 15 years or older, with the greatest
difference in the 35-54-year group. Death rates for
white and black patients only differed significantly in
the patients who were 55 years or older.
By geographic regions, the death rate for the
Northeast was higher than the rates for each of the
other regions (Table 4). The rate for the North Central
region was intermediate, whereas that of the West was
comparableto that of the South. Whenrates were exam-
ined by sexand race, similardifferenceswere observed.
Comparisonby age group of rates in the Northeast with
those in the South and West showed a significantly
higher death rate for the 15-34-year and 35-54-year
age groups.
The comparisonbetween groups of states with high
and low AIDSincidencesdid not show a difference(9.0
and 9.2/1,000,000 persons, respectively). In 1988, 48
Hodgkindiseasedeaths(2.2%)were reported inassocia-
tion with HIV infection. In the Northeast, 606 Hodgkin
disease deaths occurred, with 19 of these associated
with HIV infection. In the North Central region and the
South, there were 570 and 669 deaths attributed to
Hodgkin disease, with 5 and 11 of these occurring in
association with HIV infection, respectively.
Discussion
Marked increases in the 5-year and 10-year survival
rates forpatients with Hodgkin disease,with a concomi-
tant decrease in mortality rate, are a consequence of
modern therapeutic modalities,includingradiation ther-
apy and combination chemotherapeutic regimens.' In
view of the increase in survival of those with Hodgkin
disease, we examined the epidemiologiccharacteristics
associated with the decreased death rate.
During 1979-1988, the decreases in death rates
were proportionally the same between male and female
patients. Although the death rate for black patients did
not decrease as much as that for white patients, the
decrease observed for black patients was surprising be-
cause their prognosis generally has been poorer than
that for white patients.','' The poor prognosis among
black patients has been attributed to a high incidenceof
the pathologic subtypes generally associated with de-
creased survival. The decrease in death rate for black
patients, despitethe prevalence of an unfavorable histo-
logicsubtype, could result from the following: (1)better
access to health care, (2) earlier misdiagnosis, (3) re-
porting discrepancies, (4) inadequate studies concern-
ing Hodgkin disease in the black population, and (5) a
decrease in the incidence of Hodgkin disease in black
patients. Themost likelyexplanation is that earlierstud-
ies reporting that black patients had a worse prognosis
than white patients were incomplete. The data have
been reexamined recentlyand, when adjusted for histo-
logic subtype, no significant difference in death was
found between white and black patient^.'^ By compari-
son, members of other minorities had only a modest
declinein mortality rate. Plausible explanations for this
include lack of access to health care and reporting dis-
crepancies.
The overall decrease in death rates for Hodgkin
disease was comparable to previously reported de-
crease~.','~
The declining incidence and mortality rate
for childhood Hodgkin disease have been recognized
for a long time.',2,'' It have been suggested by Szekely
and Lee'5 and others' that this decline reflected im-
provements in economic conditions and the wide-
spread use of antibiotics. In underdeveloped countries
with poor economic conditions and inadequate health

care, the incidence of childhood Hodgkin disease has
been reported to be high.',16
Although patients who were 55 years or older con-
tinued to have the highest mortality rate, a significant
decrease in the death rate was observed. This decline
could be attributed to a decreasing incidence of Hodg-
kin disease in this age g r o ~ p ' ~ , ' ~
and to improved diag-
nosis. Several studies have reported that classification
and diagnostic errors were more prevalent in the older
age group, with Hodgkin disease often overdiag-
nosed.14,17Consequently, as diagnostic accuracy im-
proved, a correspondingdecreasein incidenceand mor-
tality rate would be expected. This decrease also could
result from more aggressive treatment of the older pa-
tient. The more modest decrease in mortality rate seen
in the 15-34-year age group may be a consequence of
an increased incidence of Hodgkin disease, which has
been reported previously forthisparticular patient pop-
ulation.l7
Geographic differences in mortality rate for Hodg-
kin diseasehave been reported previ~usly.~,~
Our study
not only confirmed these earlier findings,but also dem-
onstrated geographicvariations in the decreasesin mor-
tality rates. Although decreases in deaths were seen in
all geographic regions, there was an approximately
35% greater decrease in the South compared with the
Northeast. The magnitude of this difference was sur-
prising because, as strategiesfor the treatment of Hodg-
kin disease evolved, one would expect the decreases in
mortality rate to be more uniform in the various geo-
graphicregions. Aside from reporting differences," one
explanation for the geographic variations may be the
availability of tertiary care. Davis et al.I9 recently re-
ported that the survival rate for Hodgkin disease was
significantly lower in community-based hospitals with
approved cancer care programs as compared with com-
prehensive cancer centers.
Analysis of deaths in 1988 confirmed previous re-
ports concerning age, sex, geographic, and racial differ-
encesin patients with Hodgkin disease.' Additionally, a
significant difference was observed in the death rate
between male and female patients in the 35-54-year
age group, as was a significantdifference in death rates
in the patients who were 55 years and older. However,
these findings may reflect differences in incidence and
response to treatment.
Since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, there
have been numerous reports regarding cause of Hodg-
kin disease in people with AIDS or at risk for AIDS.20-27
In the 1988 data for multiple causes of death, 2% of
patients with Hodgkin disease as a cause of death also
were listed as having HIV infection. When examinedby
age group and geographic region, the numbers of
deaths were too small for analysis; nevertheless, they
may be suggestive of future trends. The lack of evi-
dence of cross-reacting antibodies to prototype strains
of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, human T-lym-
photropic virus type 11, or HIV-I in plasma specimens
drawn from patients with Hodgkin disease before the
AIDS epidemic suggests that classic Hodgkin disease
does not result from an infection with a known human
retrovirus or a closely related agent.28However, pa-
tients with both Hodgkin disease and an HIV infection
generally have a poorer prognosis than those with HIV
infection a10ne,20,26,27
which may reflect sequelae of the
combined functional immunologic defects resulting
from Hodgkin d i ~ e a s e * ~ , ~ ~
and HIV infection.
Despite the increasingincidence of HIV infectionin
association with Hodgkin disease, the lack of increases
in Hodgkin disease in geographic areas with a high in-
cidence of HIV suggests that the association of HIV in-
fection with Hodgkin disease reflects the overall in-
crease of HIV infection in the population and not a
causal relationship.28
