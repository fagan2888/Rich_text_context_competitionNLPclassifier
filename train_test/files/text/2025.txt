Body mass index (BMI) is the most com-
mon measure used to classify excess
adiposity. A BMI of 18.5­24.9 kg/m2 is
considered normal, a BMI of 25.0­29.9 kg/m2 is
considered overweight and a BMI of more than
30 kg/m2 is considered obese.1 Observational
studies have consistently reported deleterious
associations between elevated BMI and
morbidity/mortality.2 Each five-unit increment in
BMI above 25 kg/m2 is associated with
increases of 29% for overall mortality, 41% for
vascular mortality and 210% for diabetes-
related mortality.3 Measures of central adiposity,
including increased waist circumference, pre-
dict cardiometabolic risk independent of ele-
vated BMI.4 Thus, measuring both BMI and
central adiposity to classify and quantify
obesity-related risk and assess the appropriate-
ness of treatments such as starting the use of
antiobesity drugs or bariatric surgery is
recommended.1,5
BMI is a useful population-based tool to
classify adiposity and estimate its prevalence.6
However, BMI possesses well-known limita-
tions at the individual level,7 including the
inability to directly distinguish between lean
and fat tissue. Thus, at a given BMI, substantial
variation in adiposity can occur.8 Furthermore,
neither BMI nor waist circumference directly
reflects the presence of underlying obesity-
related comorbidity, reduced quality of life or
diminished functional status -- elements that
are widely considered to be critically important
to the clinical assessment of patients with

Background: Anthropometric-based classifica-
tion schemes for excess adiposity do not
include direct assessment of obesity-related
comorbidity and functional status and thus
have limited clinical utility. We examined the
ability of the Edmonton obesity staging sys-
tem, a 5-point ordinal classification system
that considers comorbidity and functional sta-
tus, in predicting mortality in a nationally rep-
resentative US sample.
Methods: We analyzed data from the National
Health and Human Nutrition Examination Sur-
veys (NHANES) III (1988­1994) and the NHANES
1999­2004, with mortality follow-up through to
the end of 2006. Adults (age  20 yr) with over-
weight or obesity who had been randomized to
the morning session at the mobile examination
centre were scored according to the Edmonton
obesity staging system. We examined the rela-
tionship between staging system scores and
mortality, and Cox proportional hazards models
were adjusted for the presence of the metabolic
syndrome or hypertriglyceridemic waist.
Results: Over 75% of the cohort with over-
weight or obesity were given scores of 1 or 2.
Scores of 4 could not be reliably assigned
because specific data elements were lacking.
Survival curves clearly diverged when strati-
fied by scores of 0­3, but not when stratified
by obesity class alone. Within the data from
the NHANES 1988­1994, scores of 2 (hazard
ratio [HR] 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]
1.16 to 2.13) and 3 (HR 2.69; 95% CI 1.98 to
3.67) were associated with increased mortal-
ity compared with scores of 0 or 1, even after
adjustment for body mass index and the
metabolic syndrome. We found similar results
after adjusting for hypertriglyceridemic waist
(i.e., waist circumference  90 cm and a
triglyceride level  2 mmol/L for men; the cor-
responding values for women were  85 cm
and  1.5 mmol/L), as well as in a cohort eligi-
ble for bariatric surgery.
Interpretation: The Edmonton obesity staging
system independently predicted increased
mortality even after adjustment for contem-
porary methods of classifying adiposity. The
Edmonton obesity staging system may offer
improved clinical utility in assessing obesity-
related risk and prioritizing treatment.

excess body weight. For example, BMI thresh-
olds are currently used to determine eligibility
for bariatric surgery. This approach has been
criticized, and recommendations for scoring
systems that incorporate assessments of comor-
bidity have been proposed as alternatives.9
Recently, we proposed a new clinical staging
system that ranks people with excess adiposity
on a 5-point ordinal scale, while incorporating
obesity-related comorbidities and functional stat-
us into the assessment (Box 1).6 The Edmonton
obesity staging system is intended to comple-
ment anthropometric measures, but it requires
further validation. In this study, we examine the
population distribution of Edmonton obesity
staging system scores and assess the system's
ability to predict mortality independent of
anthropometric indices in a large, nationally rep-
resentative US sample.
Methods
Data collection
We used data from the National Health and
Human Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES), including the NHANES III (1988­
1994) and the combination of three two-year
cycles of the NHANES continuous surveys
(1999­2004).10 The NHANES uses a complex,
stratified, multistage probability cluster design to
obtain nationally representative samples of the
US civilian population, with the exception of
those residing in institutions. Information on
mortality from public-use mortality files was
linked to the National Death Index, with follow-
up through Dec. 31, 2006. Nonpregnant people
with overweight or obesity aged 20 years or more
with no history of cancer and who had been ran-
domized to the morning session of the mobile
examination centre were considered eligible.
Inclusion was limited to people from the morning
session because fasting glucose measurements
were needed to assign a score using the Edmon-
ton obesity staging system. In total, 4373
respondents from the NHANES III and 3770
respondents from the NHANES 1999­2004 met
our eligibility requirements. People for whom
mortality information was missing or for whom a
score could not be assigned were excluded (n = 6
NHANES III respondents and n = 170 NHANES
1999­2004 respondents). Final unweighted sam-
ple sizes were 4367 NHANES III respondents
and 3600 NHANES 1999­2004 respondents.
Race/ethnicity was categorized into non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-
American and other. Smoking status was defined as
current smoker, former smoker (lifetime exposure 
100 cigarettes) or never smoked. When a respond-
ent reported consuming alcohol, average annual
alcohol consumption was calculated by multiplying
the number of beverages ingested daily by the
number of days on which alcohol was ingested.
The mobile examination centre consisted of
four large trailers containing the equipment and
personnel needed to perform physical and bio-
chemical evaluations. Trained examiners used
standardized protocols10 to measure weight,
standing height and waist circumference. Excess
adiposity was classified according to BMI into
overweight (25.0­29.9 kg/m2) and obese
( 30 kg/m2) categories. Obesity was further sub-
divided into grades I (30­34.9 kg/m2), II (35.0­
39.9 kg/m2) and III ( 40 kg/m2).1
The Institutional Review Board of the Univer-
sity of Alabama at Birmingham granted non-
human research designation status for this study.
Assigning Edmonton obesity staging
system scores
An Edmonton obesity staging system score was
assigned to each person with a BMI of 25 kg/m2
or more using data from the health interview,
physical examination and laboratory investiga-
tions. Respondents with a self-reported history
of angina, heart disease, heart failure and cere-
brovascular disease were given a score of 3. If
these comorbidities were absent, each of nine
obesity-related comorbidity variables and one
physical function variable (Appendix 1, avail-
able at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503
/cmaj.110387/-/DC1) were scored. Each vari-
able was scored separately, resulting in 10 dif-
ferent possible scores for each subject. Subse-
quently, the highest score across the 10
categories was assigned as the final Edmonton
obesity staging system score for that patient. For
example, a patient with diabetes (score 2),

assigned a score of 2. Respondents for whom
we had insufficient information to score at least
5 out of 10 subcategories were excluded. We
had planned to examine psychological function
and additional comorbidities (e.g., sleep apnea,
obesity hypoventilation syndrome, gastro-
esophageal reflux disease) and to also include
Edmonton obesity staging system scores of 4 in our
analysis (Box 1). However, these variables could
not be reliably assessed owing to insufficient data.
Obesity-related comorbidities
The obesity-related comorbidity variables were
diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoarthri-
tis, liver disease, kidney disease, limitations to
physical functioning, metabolic syndrome
and hypertriglyceridemic waist. The presence of
each was determined using the definitions in
Appendix 1.

power and limited follow-up. To eliminate the
potentially confounding effect of smoking, we
analyzed the subgroup of people who reported
never having smoked.
Age was used as the time scale12 for the Cox
models, also accounting for left truncation
induced by variable age at baseline. No other
adjustment for age was done.13 The proportional
hazard assumption was evaluated using Schoen-
feld residuals.14 Sex, BMI category (overweight
and class I, II, or III obesity) and Edmonton obe-
sity staging system score (0­3) were included as
model predictors. We adjusted for the presence
of the metabolic syndrome and hypertriglyceri-
demic waist in separate models. Owing to the
evidence of deviation from the proportional haz-
ards, separate baseline hazards were fit for each
combination of race/ethnicity (white, black and
other) and smoking status (current, former and
never smoked). In addition, the effect of hyper-
triglyceridemic waist was modelled as a time-
dependant covariate with different coefficients
for 60 years of age or younger, 61­82 years of
age, and older than 82 years. These thresholds
were based on the distribution of age ranges
within the dataset.
All analyses accounted for the complex
sampling design of the NHANES surveys.
Analyses were performed using SAS version
9.1.3 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC) and the survey
package15 for the R Statistical Computing
Environment.16

the criteria for bariatric surgery. Across all BMI
categories, most respondents received a score
of 2; the next most common score was 1 (Ap-
pendix 3, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup
/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.110387/-/DC1).
Kaplan­Meier plots examining mortality
according to Edmonton obesity staging system
score for the overall population, for the subgroup
of people who had never smoked and within
each BMI class showed marked differences
between the survival curves for each obesity
stage (Figures 1­3). In contrast, when mortality
was assessed only according to BMI class, sepa-
ration of the curves was far less apparent (Fig-
ures 1 and 2).
Using data from the NHANES 1988­94,
multivariable Cox proportional hazards model-
ling showed that the adjusted hazard ratio (HR)
for death increased with higher Edmonton obe-
sity staging system scores (because of the small
number of observed deaths for respondents with
a score of 0, scores 0 and 1 were collapsed into
a single category). Scores of 2 (HR 1.57, 95%
CI 1.16­2.13) and 3 (HR 2.69, 95% CI 1.98­
3.67) were associated with a higher adjusted
mortality hazard compared with scores of 0 or 1
even after adjustment for the metabolic syn-
drome (Table 1). Results were similar after
adjusting for hypertriglyceridemic waist and in
the cohort of respondents eligible for bariatric
surgery (Table 1).
Interpretation
Main findings
Within a nationally representative cohort,
higher Edmonton obesity staging system scores
were a strong predictor of increasing mortality
in both the overall population and in a cohort
of people eligible for bariatric surgery. This
ability was independent of BMI and the pres-
ence of metabolic syndrome or hypertriglyceri-
demic waist. Even within strata of BMI cate-
gories, there was clear separation of survival
curves according to Edmonton obesity staging
system scores.
The Edmonton obesity staging system does
not directly or indirectly measure adiposity,
therefore it cannot be used to define excess adi-
posity. Rather, the system is intended to comple-
ment anthropometric indices and provide incre-
mental clinically relevant prognostic information
in a manner analogous to the "tumor, node,
metastasis" system widely used in oncology to
define the size and extent of the spread of can-
cer.6 The major incremental contribution of this
staging system to anthropometric indices and
cardiovascular risk equations is the direct mea-

Hypertriglyceridemic waist was modeled by age as a time-dependent covariate owing to
evidence of deviation from proportional hazards when constant effects were assumed over

surement of the presence and severity of under-
lying obesity-related comorbidities, which
enables a more comprehensive and individual-
ized assessment of risk.
Such enhanced risk assessment may enable a
greater understanding of obesity-related progno-
sis and may also assist in determining the
urgency of intervention. This may be particu-
larly useful as a means for prioritizing patients
for bariatric surgery. Surgery is widely consid-
ered to be an effective treatment for severe obe-
sity.1 However, surgery is difficult to access in
Canada because of high demand and limited
capacity, which has led to the emergence of pro-
tracted, multiyear wait times.17,18 Currently, most
patients are selected for surgery on the basis of
BMI thresholds alone and have few obesity-
related comorbidities. The practice of selecting
patients using BMI alone has been criticized as
inaccurate and arbitrary and may result in the
selection of patients who are least likely to ben-
efit from weight reduction.9 Prioritizing patients
with higher Edmonton obesity staging system
scores -- and thus greater comorbidity and risk
of death -- may help maximize the benefits of
surgery. Further study, including full character-
ization of the risks and benefits, especially for
patients with the highest scores, is required.
Limitations
Comorbidities within the Edmonton obesity
staging system, such as diabetes and osteoarthri-
tis, have been arbitrarily assigned to be equiva-
lent in terms of their burden of illness. It is not
yet clear whether certain comorbidities should
receive a higher weighting.
Because this study was a retrospective analy-
sis of pre-existing data, certain pertinent data for
assigning Edmonton obesity staging system
scores, such as respondents' psychological func-
tioning, were unavailable. In addition, some
comorbidities were based on self-report or were
inferred as present based on the absence of other
common causes (e.g., fatty liver disease), thus
they may be subject to a higher risk of bias than
direct measurements.
We have examined total mortality only; other
end points such as quality of life and costs merit
assessment.
No differentiation between types of diabetes
could be made (of Americans with diabetes,
90%­95% have type 2 diabetes).19 However, both
subtypes would require management in an over-
weight or obese cohort and were thus judged
appropriate for inclusion.
A final potential limitation is that the most
recent mortality follow-up available was from
2006. Although not contemporaneous, we feel
that the results of this study remain relevant to
people who currently have overweight or obe-
sity. We do, however, acknowledge the need for
additional follow-up analyses.
Conclusion
The Edmonton obesity staging system is a
strong predictor of increasing mortality indepen-
dent of BMI, metabolic syndrome and hyper-
triglyceridemic waist. We propose that this sys-
tem be considered adjunctive to current
anthropometric classification systems in assess-
ing obesity-related risk, determining prognosis
and guiding treatment. Further refinement of the
staging system would assist in determining the
best way of incorporating it into clinical care.
