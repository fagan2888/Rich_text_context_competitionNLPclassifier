Preamble
W: "J., did you see that call for papers of <academic jour-
nal> on the return to practice of academic writing and
teaching? What do you say, shall we go for a joint
paper?"
J: "Yes, great, let's have a go. We've churning the dys-
functional relationship between academia and practice
over in many discussions, why not have a go at writing
something down." Some days later.
W: "So? What do you think of my draft proposal? Too
radical?"
J: "Not at all. But . . . you know, the part where you pro-
pose to criticize long publication lead times . . . to do
this in a paper call for Fall 2009 with a slim hope to be
published in 2012 . . . isn't that a trifle incoherent?"
W: "Hmmm, you're right . . . so how about we begin the
paper like that: `When this was written, both Chirac
and Bush were presidents, most cars were powered by
internal combustion engines . . . ,' and take it from
there . . .?"
It was in the fall of 2008 when the author had these conver-
sations with a dear friend. Inspired by the call, a fast and
furious first controversial proposal went forth, and back,
between them, advocating no less than a redesign of academia,
including the common sense suggestion that the academic
publishing process be streamlined and its product made easier
to digest. We abstained from submitting to the call in question
in favor of a tighter version for a journal that claims shorter
lead times. We thus have, in other words, sacrificed journal
ratings, so cherished by academic evaluation committees,
accreditation authorities and rankings, to gain on readability,
with some hope of a rich and timely dialogue with interested
readers. You could say that we behaved more like practitioners
and less like academics. Three months later, the submission
deadline we still had not heard from the editors, and so we
withdrew. A short while later, the author's comrade-in-arms
sadly passed away and with him this budding paper. Three
years later, as Sarkozy and Obama were just about still presi-
dents, the status quo of academia described back then was
unchanged, the surviving author took up these ideas once
again and developed them in this opinion paper.
(Ir-)relevance in Management Research
The critique is not novel: A growing number of academics
argue that it is desirable to get involved in the "real world,"
both for students and professors as for researchers, and

Lost in Translation? On Mind and Matter
in Management Research

Abstract
Again and again scholars evoke a seriously dysfunctional relationship between management research and education on the
one hand, and the practice of management on the other. We share this viewpoint, and with this appraisal intend to (re-)
open the debate. We expose some views on the intellectual and sociological roots of the malaise, advocating a philosophical
stance rooted in pragmatism and particularly in John Dewey's pragmatic stance. We outline a number of essentially workable,
albeit for debate's sake provocative and unpolished proposals for the redesign of academic institutions and of their publishing
process. We sketch out radical redesign of academia--with, inter alia, (a) permeable academic and practical careers, so that
executives and scholars could move between and act within each others' realities; (b) a focus of management education on
post-experience graduate level; and (c) an academic publishing process worthy of the real-time era of the Internet.

learn alongside managers how to better contribute to the
learning in the organizational studies field. Table 1 sum-
marizes key critiques of academia and of the relevance gap
(Starkey & Madan, 2001) between theory and practice.
These scholars defend diverse perspectives n terms of
whether this divide can be, or even should be overcome.
Some posit that the generation of knowledge by academics
and practitioners are separate missions and that purpose of
research is essentially to develop theory and to univer-
sally contribute to the understanding of phenomena
(Jarzabkowski, Mohrman & Scherer 2010). Others do not
reject practical relevance per se, but consider the scholar-
practitioner divide as irreconcilable as these two communi-
ties develop and apply knowledge fundamentally differently
(e.g. Kieser & Leiner 2009, 2012). Others again ­ and we
pertain to these ­ acknowledge and regret the separation
between the scholar and practitioner communities, and the
lack of practical relevance of academic inquiry and they
suggest diverse measures ad various levels of analysis by
which to connect, to translate, and to co-construct knowl-
edge that is both scientifically valid and practicable. This
article goes further, advocating that academics at least those
that are concerned with the practical impact of their inquiry
should in some way be able to become managers, while
remaining scholars. And, why not, vice versa. This in turn
requires a radical redesign of academia--especially of its
self-conception and the publishing process--and we sketch
out one such redesign. Our views are rooted in pragmatism
(e.g., Dewey, 1929; James, 1907; Peirce, 1992, 1998), a
philosophy of science that emphasizes the link between
action and truth and argues that a good validation of for
belief is the willingness to act on it. Pragmatism a priori
situates research and learning evolutionarily within the pro-
cess of living, in the shape of an intelligent adaptation of
the species to its environment. The theory of cognition of
the Cartesian subject­object differentiation is undermined
in pragmatism by a theory of action, in which the object and
the subject reciprocally constitute themselves. One could
say that inquiry, with truth rather than knowledge, is the
essence of logic here. Dewey (1926) proposed activity-
based learning rather than a traditional teacher-dominated
approach, because learning was "an affair of the intercourse
of a living being with its physical and social environment"
(Bernstein, 1971, p. 23). Inspired by Dewey' reflections,
Eduard C. Lindeman (1926) argued,
Our academic system has grown in reverse order. Subjects and
teachers constitute the starting point, [learners] are secondary. In
conventional education the [learner] is required to adjust himself
to an established curriculum . . . Too much of learning consists
of vicarious substitutions of someone else's experience and
knowledge. Psychology teaches us that we learn what we do . . .
Experience is the adult learner's living textbook. (p. 4)
Today, a hundred years after Dewey (1904) first expressed
a fundamental tension in the "proper relationship" between
the theory and practice in inquiry, much formal education
and inquiry continue to suffocate naturally inquisitive minds
by controlling and isolating the environment of inquiry.
Why this isolation? Why do we, for example, know so little
about top executives, especially unsuccessful ones? A query
among 180 academics at a Swiss conference (Fendt, 2005)
yielded some possible explanations:
·
· Top executives are difficult to reach. Their availability
for research on specific management topics of their
concern is already limited, their availability for
research on their selves is close to none. Unsuccessful
leaders are even more difficult to persuade to speak
about their experiences.
·
· Academics are under constant pressure to publish. It
is easier and faster to build on work from existing
research.
·
· Situations and contexts in which executives perform
their work are so diverse and complex, and fast-
changing, that it seems difficult to establish data that
permit valid conclusions, generalization, or theory
building.
·
· Scholars prefer to focus on the successful aspects of
business, hoping to materialize their findings in a
blockbuster management book.
·
· Most management scholars have little access to the
practical business world, and some are not really
interested to meet practitioners. Most CEOs have little
theoretical experience or interest. The dialogue seems
difficult; worlds of practice and theory seem to remain
separate.
·
· When scholars do have access to the practical busi-
ness world, for example, as business consultants, they
are sometimes reluctant to bite the hand that feeds
them.
·
· Academic research is increasingly privately financed
and some scholars might not wish to disgruntle a most
welcome source of income. To remain independent,
they prefer to address more uncompromising topics.
Unrepresentative and speculative as these explanations
may be, they reflect a defeatism or even autism not unfa-
miliar to the ear of scholars throughout Western academic
cultures. Some might be tempted to use "put your money
where your mouth is" as a catchphrase to characterize
pragmatism--if it were not that, one of the masters himself
provides us with more colorful "truth's cash value" (James,
1907, p. 200) or "the true is only the expedient" (p. 222).
Pragmatists consider confrontation with reality through
action as the principal source of doubt, which in turn feeds
scientific curiosity and becomes the driving force to inquire
to settle that doubt, and make way for new doubt.1 Thus,
action and the interrogations stemming from it--and the
desire to find answers--are what drive the agenda of science
(Peirce, 1992), and what drives many scientists to become

Markides (2011) There is growing concern within the Academy of Management
that a big and growing gap exists between management
research and practice. In fact, the gap is not between
rigorous and relevant research; it is between relevant
and useful knowledge
For our (relevant) research to become managerially useful, it still needs
to go through a transformation. Unfortunately, academics are not good
at this transformation process. This has a serious implication on what
we actually need to do to make our research more managerially useful

practitioners. This, to them is what Ackoff calls a "meta-
ideal," where ends and means converge and become the
same: "One can desire nothing without desiring the ability to
satisfy it. The ability to satisfy all desires is an ideal neces-
sarily shared by all men at all times" (Gharajedaghi, 1983,
citing Ackoff in a discussion in 1978).
We argue that many of the challenges concerning the
rigor-relevance dichotomy that scholars face can be over-
come, or attenuated by reverting to Pragmatism, especially
John Dewey's Pragmatism. Dewey's ontology and episte-
mology on theory, on knowledge and on action, and on the
relationship between them, gives us important clues on how
we could shape our inquiry to be both scientifically sound
and matter to the practitioner. Jarzabkowski et al (2010) situ-
ate the problem as being philosophical, theoretical and
empirical. A rigor-driven stance essentially strives to rely on
a stable, objective world, on universal principles and on
knowledge that objectively represents the world "out there".
The world presents itself before us, waiting to be discovered,
measured, explored and conceptualized. Concepts are
expected to be impartial and universally applicable across
diverse realities. In this logic, action succeeds precise, exact
management knowledge (Jarzabkowski et al 2010).
On the other hand, a stance tending toward relevance sees
reality as a phenomenological "life world" (Husserl 1970)
highly contingent and fortuitous, and fairly skeptical of all
theorizing demeanors. Knowledge is local, intrinsic, contin-
gency and context-reliant. The researcher and the research
are inseparable. Knowledge results from action, which is
sought to be directly practicable. These two logics appear
irreconcilable at first sight. However, through John Dewey's
pragmatic epistemology a third way, or rather a reconcilia-
tion appears to be possible. In Pragmatism, there is indeed a
world "out there", but it has sense and meaning only in rela-
tion to man. Likewise, theory is omnipresent, but not as
absolute and universal laws, but rather as explanations of
phenomena and their relationships. Dewey introduced the
"warranted assertion" as research product. This assertion has
a generalized role and a particular one as well. Warranted
assertions merge truth and inquiry together in such a way that
correspondence to an external world is no longer the princi-
pal point. Instead, interdependency of truths and the pro-
cesses of inquiry are just as central. The momentary
satisfaction of a solved problem in a world that is not set
apart from the knower's uses of or places in that world. This
is different from both idealists' and realists' description of of
epistemology as way of determining knowledge. It is not «
knowledge" that represents the focal point of epistemology
for Dewey, but rather "knowing". "Knowledge" represents
the end of inquiry but for Dewey it is more, it has meaning of
its own, disconnected from the inquiry. So much so, that
inquiry is subordinated to the final result called "knowl-
edge." With "knowing" on the other hand, Dewey defines
inquiry in a world that is not static. He means inquiry
into things that humans live, experience. He means
experimenting with problem solving in such a way as for the
action to be entailed in the solving of problems, which is
inquiry itself, and warranted in the assertions made about the
solved problem when it is solved, « solved » being nothing
mor than the door to another inquiry and so on. Accordingly,
in the "living" of life, problems will be faced and solved--
often in serendipitous ways--such that achieving "justified
true belief" (as traditional epistemology expects) is not use-
ful. As Dewey put it: "[Warranted assertion] is preferred to
the terms belief and knowledge [because] it is free from the
ambiguity of these latter terms, and it involves reference to
inquiry as that which warrants assertion. When knowledge is
taken as a general abstract term related to inquiry in the
abstract, it means "warranted assertibility." The use of a term
that designates potentiality rather than an actuality involves
recognition that all special conclusions of special inquiries
are parts of enterprise that is continually renewed, or is a
going concern (Dewey 1938).
Clearly, the outcome of such inquiry goes beyond "rigor"
in terms of precise and exact knowledge to be applied across
diverse settings and situations, and also beyond "relevance",
as a solution to an immediate practical problem. Rather this
notion of knowledge is "useful" in every sense of the term,
be it epistemological (is this credible, well-founded and
trustworthy?) but also normative (does this help us advance
in our preoccupations?). It does not put action and knowl-
edge into a preset sequence. Dualism is not inevitable nor is
it a compulsory starting point of all philosophical thought:
"What have been completely divided in philosophical dis-
course into man and world, inner and outer, self and not-self,
subject and object, individual and social, private and public,
etc. are in actuality life transactions. (Dewey & Bentley
1949". Dewey talks of knowledge and action, rather than
rigor and relevance, and did not specify that one necessarily
precedes the other, but considered them rather as iterative, as
intertwined, as a permanent conversation.
Reflection is important in inquiry, but its value can be best
assessed if it is put into practice, hence his focus on the
notion of "usefulness" and purported to move away from
"knowing as an aesthetic enjoyment of the properties of
nature as a world of divine art, to knowing as a means of
secular control ­ this is a method of purposefully introducing
changes which will alter the direction of the course of events
(Dewey 1924)".
From these approaches ­ that transcend ontological fun-
damentalism and inane debates on whether action precedes
knowledge or knowledge precedes action ­ we construe ele-
ments of academic redesign and a portfolio of research
behaviors that satisfy academic rigor and have a potential for
relevance and practicability.
Getting One's Feet Wet
To many academics, a (re-)turn to practice means getting
close to where the action is, and generating theoretical
6 SAGE Open
contributions grounded in observation of actual managerial
practices, rather than based on aprioristic notions (see, for
example, the collection of papers edited by Schatzki, Knorr-
Cetina, & von Savigny, 2001). These approaches frequently
rely on some variant of the participation-observation method
This method is directly descendant from John Dewey's. The
researcher somehow participates alongside managers in their
work, and observes what they do. Care is taken through a
variety of stratagems to minimize the well-known disruptive
effect of participation. But there are limits to what can be
done: A couple engaged in an intimate act is likely to not
behave as usual if there is a third party present as an observer,
let alone as a participant. Candid cameras and hidden mikes
are either unknown to the subjects, and therefore unethical,
or known and producing disruptive effects akin to direct
observation. In sum, managers are reluctant to tolerate a
redundant researcher in tow and there is no extra seat on the
corporate jet--but, they often appreciate a second opinion or
even a helping hand.
This is well understood by constructionist scholars advo-
cating such research methods as narrative interviewing or
ethnography in which the researcher's footprint is not only
acknowledged but also sought. Such narratives
present the doing of the field work, rather than simply the doer
or the done . . . [and they are meant to be understood as]
representational means of cracking open the culture and the field
worker's way of knowing it, so that both can be jointly examined.
(Van Maanen, 1988, p. 120)
The benefits of this inevitable interference by the
researcher are equally well understood and, more so, sought
by academics that can be classified as "action researchers"
and/or "action learners" (Argyris, 2000; Lewin, 1948). They
advocate in one way or another getting involved with manag-
ers in solving their problems--becoming part of the system--
and learning from their experience as well, not just that of
others. The action learner combines individual and organiza-
tional change of practical knowledge by getting involved in
everyday organizational challenges (Brooks, 2004; Dick,
1997; Revans, 1991, 1998) through different types of action
learning (Yorks & Marsick, 2002): scientific, experiential,
and critical reflection (Marsick, 1988; O'Neil & Marsick,
1994; Pedler, 1991). With Marsick and O'Neil (1999),
"action" is no more and no less than the starting point of any
inquiry (Marsick & O'Neil, 1999): Actors critically reflect on
experience with the support of others. This reflection--
doubt--is followed by further action, which represents
change, rather than simply repetition of patterns. Although
guided by strategic intent, the outcome is purposely not fully
controlled because the status quo is challenged and the
researcher and/or learner are actors in the change process.
The action researcher, similarly, has a double agenda:
that of a consultant or hired hand who works for the man-
ager, and that of a researcher who seeks to further
theoretical understanding. The client-manager is not involv-
ed with the second agenda, and hopefully gets to see the
researcher as a valuable resource, maybe even find a seat on
the corporate jet. The ability to simultaneously help solve
difficult business problems, conceptualize actions and
reflections into theories and models, and thus develop peo-
ple and organizations combine to form the attractiveness of
the action researcher (Argyris, Putnam, & Smith, 1985). In
a time of rising complexity, characterized by alternative
explanations and multiple ways of perceiving and explain-
ing, and in a business context where blueprint answers no
longer suffice, the idea of connecting researchers and actors
to solve these very real problems is enticing (a seminal
example of such a rich research endeavor is Watson, 1994).
The researcher gains much greater insights, while such
insights may be less structured, less systematic, and not nec-
essarily well documented.
Donald Schön (1987) described the way in which practi-
tioners (engineers, doctors, architects, managers) work, pro-
ceeding on intuition (tacit knowledge), seldom explicitly
stating their assumptions and theories until they run into
unexpected trouble or some situation that arises their doubt.
It is then that they reflect upon and improve their models,
becoming "reflective practitioners." This suggests that sim-
ple observation of practitioners during the times of routine or
tacit activities will not reveal much, unless, of course, one
assumes that the observer is a lot more knowledgeable and
astute than the manager, and has figured out explicit theories
and models long before the manager had. This works for
observing young children, perhaps primitive tribes, but is not
very promising when dealing with cutting-edge management
practitioners. The researcher to truly understand managers
would probably have to become one, at least temporarily or
on a part-time basis.
Ma Academia Is a Hard Nut to Crack
While a handful of business schools thrive on close practice
contact, most of academia today is not at the leading edge of
management practices (Kumar, Scheer, & Kotler, 2000).
Most management innovation happens in corporations, con-
sulting, and other professional services companies, and the
word is then spread by gurus, rather than academics
(Huczynski, 1996). Academia is more often than not rele-
gated to studying innovations introduced by others, and
reporting on them with mind-numbing delays due to the
mercilessly lengthy publishing process. Many innovations
analyzed by academics are long forgotten by practitioners,
or substantially modified, by the time they get reported.
Despite the ritualistic lip service paid to "accelerating rate
of change and explosion of knowledge generation," many
academic journals resemble historical archives of manage-
ment ideas. In the 19th century, a fellow living in the
Australian outback could hope to read a London newspaper
Fendt 7
describing an occurrence in his neighborhood in less than a
year after the event--a few months for the news to get to
London, 24 hr to print it, and another few months for the
newspaper to reach the reader. This is the speed of light
compared with the academic publishing process. The mate-
rial transmitted to students, via textbooks and cases, is not
much more up to date, and misconceptions or errors are
propagated from one generation to another, because aca-
demics have so little chance to confront them with reality
(see, for example, Dunning, 2006, for a critique of textbooks
on intercultural management; and Holden, 2002, for a cri-
tique of a prioris in intercultural management research). We
agree with Blau (1994), when he claims that " bureaucratic
features of academic institutions have deleterious conse-
quences for educational performance" (p. 279), but in the
light of academic publishing processes of sometimes several
years, we cannot but disagree with his statement that
research is not concerned, because "research can be sepa-
rated from an institution's administrative machinery while
education is intricately enmeshed in it" (p. 280).
On July 6, 2006 in Bergen, in a keynote address to a thou-
sand organizational scientists assembled for the annual
European Group for Organizational Studies (EGOS)
Colloquium, James March observed that the agenda of orga-
nizational research is seldom driven by a demand from man-
agers "out there in the real world," but rather by the
spectacular growth of management teaching that creates the
need for professors that in turn need to publish. A look at the
many business school strategy documents that are published
on the Internet shows that while they pay lip service to "con-
tributing to societal knowledge about management," they
view the primary role of research as supporting development
of faculty, not as a service to broader society. Academia
remains the proverbial ivory tower, and isolates itself by a
myriad of elaborate, frequently ornamental and usually ossi-
fied values, organizational rituals, procedures, and routines
that penalize a true dialogue with real management.
Interestingly, March's (2008) malaise is not a lack of rele-
vance but a lack of essence, as becomes evident from his
intervention at the 2008 Academy of Management (AOM)
Meeting: "not `essential' in the sense of being necessary to
achieve some desired end, `essential' in the sense of being a
necessary property, without which something is not what it
claims to be." This is an intriguing and gripping standpoint
that merits an inquiry of its own elsewhere.
The related concepts and other recent endeavors to reduce
the relevance gap, such as engaged scholarship (Van de Ven
& Johnson, 2006), collaborative research (Shani, Mohrman,
Pasmore, Stymne, & Adler, 2008), and design research, are
welcome developments. But they remain for now anecdotal
and academia by and large a closed system. Like all closed
systems, it elaborates myths about itself. The ones we like
most are the long catalogs of knowledge and skills that are
deemed essential for managers. The lists vary from one
institution to another, and probably by pure coincidence
often reflect the relative power positions of various depart-
ments and important professors. But it is always too long,
and consumes all the time available to students. Of course,
the overwhelming majority of managers practicing in
the world today have no formal business education at all.
Some of them fail these requirements as miserably as pos-
sible--not knowing about them at all--and yet they thrive
in their business environment. Think of the fellow who sold
you a trinket at the bazaar in Marrakech. By contrast, the
young graduates of business schools are all but managers.
Their heads are stuffed (or not) with lots of knowledge, but
they know little about working with unstructured situations
such as those encountered by managers. In an ultimate per-
version of the system, the best among them may have been
selected by professors for cloning, and trained to become
future professors, not managers.
Getting One's Hands Dirty
Business schools aspire to educating managers, or, more
ambitiously yet, leaders; but the job they do reasonably well
is educating technical professionals who are needed by busi-
nesses in great numbers: accountants, financial analysts,
market researchers, logistics dispatchers, database adminis-
trators, and so on. In that, the business school is not that dif-
ferent from an engineering school.With time, many graduates
end up working as managers, but engineers harbor no illu-
sions about having been trained to do so, whereas business
school graduates do. We do not object to getting hold of
some very young people, teaching them actuarial techniques
over 2 or 3 years, and sending them off to the insurance
industry. We also agree that, as in the case of engineering
students, it is good to provide these young people with a
smothering of general business notions, with courses address-
ing such issues as "working with humans," "working with
humans of different colors that eat stinking food," and
"working for inhumans that are obsessed about keeping to a
budget," sensitizing them to the environment in which they
will operate. But perhaps we should moderate our pretense
of certifying as managers let alone leaders 22-year-olds by
the hundreds of thousands unless we want their rank and file
end up read such books as "how to work for an idiot"
(Hoover, 2004).
We advocate, with Mintzberg (2004), that there be no
undergraduate management education. We argue a bit
crudely that if it were a good idea to teach sex to toddlers,
then so would teaching management to 18-year-olds. Their
education could be left to traditional disciplines like mathe-
matics or history, even economics, and a lot of hands on
entrepreneurship. And, why not, philosophy--and profes-
sional certification as discussed above. What we consider
essential is that undergraduates not only learn the requisite
body of knowledge but also--and beforehand--learn to
learn, that is, reflect on knowledge, question it, learn to find
sources of knowledge that is new to them, and autonomously
8 SAGE Open
choose to acquire it or not. We argue that the acquisition of a
requisite body of management knowledge prior to the acqui-
sition of the competency of learning to learn and of critical
action learning (as described above) may be one cause of
decreasing entrepreneurship and rampant managerialism.2
This requirement has profound implications for the teaching
process, especially in some European countries, and many
emerging ones as well, where, as stated above, over one cen-
tury after Dewey's plea that learning be rooted in action, the
tradition of spoon-feeding students is still going strong and
little attention is paid to developing their reflective
autonomy. The "proper relationship" between theory and
practice seems not yet found.
So, perhaps management education ought to be restricted
to graduate level, requiring students to have had some man-
agement experience before engaging in it. To stay with our
prior metaphor, this is like having sex before studying some
enhanced techniques on the subject matter. Teaching people
who have experienced the thing is vastly different than trying
to convey some theoretical abstractions (here we speak from
our experience as managers and management educators
only). This is easier said than done: Despite some efforts in
Table 2. Some Pragmatic Suggestions of Management Research Redesign.
Critique Suggestion(s)
Dysfunctional relationship between management research and the practice of management, namely,
1. Management professors are often quite far away from
practice and unfamiliar with, sometimes uninterested in, the
management realities
1.1 Academia and praxis follow two different types of logic and
produce two different types of knowledge, and both are nec-
essary.To be both rigorous and relevant, a researcher might
want to discover both
 1.2 Management professors might be advised to adopt a stance
rooted in pragmatism, that is, confront themselves and their
certitudes with reality, reality being the principal source of
doubt, which is the driving force for inquiry
 1.3 Professors of management should also be--or have been and
be again--managers, just like professors of medicine are also
medical doctors
 1.4 Accept the complexity and speed of cutting-edge manage-
ment in a globalizing world and invite these multiple realities
into the classroom--and bring the classroom to them--
rather than covering anachronistic canons of seemingly
essential knowledge skills for managers
 1.5 Management development practice, institutions, and compa-
nies would benefit from developing systems that allowed for
a lifelong easy to and fro between academia and practice
2. Management needs to be learned not taught, management
education must be rooted in action
2.1 Management education should begin at post-experience
graduate level, that is, at a time when it can be reasonably
expected to be understood and useful
3. Management research should focus less on linear regression
and more on qualitative, interpretive, single-case research,
and especially, rediscover action and collaborative research
3.1 Management researchers should embrace the subjectivity of
most types of management research (usually relying on some
form of participant observation method), and develop new
and appropriate validity and reliability criteria that ensure sci-
entific rigor in new ways
 3.2 Management scholars should understand and exploit the
benefits of this researcher interference (as in action learning/
action research, engaged scholarship, collaborative research,
design research,etc.) as a source of organizational change and
innovation as well as of management development
 3.3 Theoretical integration between academia and practice can be
achieved with action research and design-driven approaches
4. Innovation of management practices is happening, but mostly
in practice, not in academia. Academia is often lagging behind
4.1 Speed up and simplify the academic publishing process to
bring it closer to reality
 4.2 Exploit the "mass-customization" potential of Internet to
accelerate, generalize, and/or specialize research publication
and, especially, to accelerate and intensify debate and knowl-
edge exchange
 4.3 Drop some anachronistic publishing guidelines that date from
the days of the typewriters and enter the real-time era of
Internet
Fendt 9
recent years, the attitudes in many European workplaces and
the continuing inflexibility of labor markets make it still dif-
ficult for young people to move back and forth between work
and study. A thorough reform of business education may not
be possible without a redesign of labor practices.
Ideally, the bulk of management education would happen
in parallel with work, the two intertwined and feeding each
other. In other words, we aspire to abolishing the distinction
between full-time and part-time education. The idea is to
teach Kamasutra in practice sessions, not with blackboard
and chalk, not even with an animated PowerPoint. All types
of work-study schemes exist already and professors gener-
ally are impressed with how much better students do in those
situations. And that is without professors changing much to
who they are, nor to what they do. Working students do bet-
ter in conventional knowledge-transmission courses taught
in majority by professors with no business experience.
Imagine what could be accomplished if one changed the pro-
fessors and what they did!
This is what makes us argue that perhaps management
professors might more often be practitioners, just as medical
professors are. Mind you that there would be far fewer of
them if, as we suggested, management education separated
from entrepreneurship and education for business-related
professions. There are several ways in which professors can
also be practitioners--and in many cases are today: they can
work in two places on a part-time basis, they can switch
back and forth during their careers, and they can be consul-
tants. One can even imagine some sort of conglomeration
between business schools and companies that would make
the moving back-and-forth easier. To be a professor, one
would have to be academically qualified, which usually
means holding a doctoral degree. Professors would be "very
reflective practitioners" to build on the term used by Schön
(1987), and engage in furthering the practice and publishing
about it. Ideally, some practitioners would also move
between worlds, which would require such worlds to be
redesigned as well. This might not be for tomorrow, and
meanwhile we suggest increased use of collaborative
research and engaged scholarship, with information collec-
tion, analysis discussion, and/or conclusion perfectly shared
among academics and practitioners. These practices permit
to change roles, to look upon strategy and management
through diverse prisms, and thereby advance in understand-
ing and designing effective and sustainable management,
strategy, and entrepreneurship.
Last but not least, we argue that publishing should change
dramatically. We propose to distinguish between at least two
roles played by academic journals. They publish and dis-
seminate information, producing (for now) physical volumes
and delivering them to subscribers and libraries, and thus
assuring perennial access. And they organize an editorial
process, giving--at least in theory--some intellectual coher-
ence to the collections of papers, screening for quality,
assisting authors in improving their presentation, and pro-
moting readership and "citationship" of their journals.
If contemplated unemotionally, it seems clear that the first
role, that of physical production, dissemination, and storage,
is vastly obsolete in the era of Internet. This does not mean
that coherent periodical volumes should not be published.
There arguably can be some value in presenting a collection
of papers together. And their publication on fixed dates
allows some readers to absorb novelty in chunks rather as a
continuous stream, and some authors to accelerate their final
touches and get their study out, both of which may be helpful
in organizing their respective working lives. But a publica-
tion via Internet would do just fine.
Thus, journals would be reduced to their essence: a group
of like-minded academics who come together as an editorial
board to provide guidance and a stamp of approval to what is
being put out there for public consumption. This opens the
possibility for many more different kinds of journals or spe-
cial volumes, with a variety of editorial policies and philoso-
phies. For example, for the run-of-the-mill academic paper
that is not related to any other articles appearing in the same
issue, one could envision as self-editing journal: A paper is
accepted if it is accompanied by statements from three bona
fide academics, each from a different institution, or even
from a different country, that clearly indicate why they think
the article is worth publishing. These statements would be
published along with the article, putting thus online the repu-
tation of the reviewers. One could also require a statement
from the home institution of the author that the paper was
professionally edited for English, proper references, and so
on.
Once we accept that the Internet is the publishing medium,
there is a host of other suggestions that come to mind: accom-
pany each article with a website, including a forum for public
exchange of comments; and work in progress on a blog and/
or other forms of knowledge sharing, such as, perhaps,
Wikipedia-type communities of research practices. The
Journal board could moderate such forums, or delegate that
responsibility to one of the reviewers. The website could also
include additional information for the very motivated reader,
including some of the original data based on which the arti-
cle is written, increasing thus the transparency and the pro-
bity of the research process. Also foreseeable--and probably
inevitable--are unmonitored, Wiki-type communities-of-
practice/research on a selection of subjects.
And this would be a great opportunity to going back to a
more intelligible way of presenting articles. We love foot-
notes!!! They let one write sentences that flow without inter-
rupting them with long parentheses with a bunch of names
and dates. Most people are not interested, and those who are
can look at the footnotes. Footnotes also allow the writer to
make disclaimers or some parenthetical points without sacri-
ficing readability of the text or its length. Footnotes were
banned at the time when technology did not place them
10 SAGE Open
automatically and typesetting labor became very expensive.
Those times are gone! Forever, we venture to think. And
while we are at it: Why still submit papers in double-spaced
format with "insert figure about here" tags? Reviewing such
papers is a pain. Again, adapt to the technology!
Authors may take advantage of their sense of humor, if
they are lucky to have one. They do as public speakers or
as lecturers. One can do serious business and have fun
doing it. Authors should every now and then have the guts
to advance their convictions and stop being so tentative in
the name of academic rigor. If one thinks that one's
thoughts seem like they might possibly lead to a potential
and gradual shift of certain limited areas of thought, then
one should keep that thought to oneself, and keep on think-
ing. Objectivity does not repose on the lone shoulders of
each author. It results from interplay and dialogue (see
Sachs, 2003, on this point). If one is wrong, there sure is
someone out there to point this out. If somebody bothered
to answer, then the article did stimulate somebody some-
where--and did its job.
Summary and Conclusion
We have evoked the pervasive dysfunctional relationship
between management research and education on the one
hand, and the practice of management on the other. We
exposed some views on the intellectual and sociological
roots of the malaise and advocate a philosophical stance
rooted in Pragmatism and particularly in John Dewey's
pragmatic stance. We explain how Dewey's Pragmatism ­
particularly his understanding of action, his notion of use-
fulness and his experimentalism can help us to unmask the
apparent dichotomy between rigor and relevance and come
up with a scientifically sound and yet practicable research
behavior. Based on this, we outline a number of essentially
workable, albeit for debate's sake provocative proposals for
the redesign of academic institutions and of their publishing
process. We sketch out a radical redesign of academia ­
with, inter alia, a) permeable academic and practical careers,
so that executives and scholars could move between and act
within each others' realities b) a focus of management edu-
cation on post-experience graduate level, and c) an aca-
demic publishing process worthy of the real-time era of the
Internet.
Summarizing is not necessary if an argumentation is short
and clear. And not all conversations lead to a conclusion.
Still, Table 2 is provided that summarizes our proposals,
which we do by no means consider conclusive but rather an
invitation to debate.
Author's Note
This is an opinion paper based on the stance that objectivity does
not repose on the lone shoulders of each academic author but can--
and does--emerge from interplay and dialogue. If one is wrong,
there surely is someone out there to point this out. If somebody
bothers to answer, then this article did stimulate, and permit
advancement--and therefore served its most noble purpose.

far too soon to see this published, the irony of which will greatly

Notes
1. We do not attribute the notion of doubt only to pragmatism.
Doubt is also present in the theories of Popper (1935), who
sees scientific progress in focusing on unresolved problems,
curiosity, and the things we do not know.
2. "Managerialism" is defined as viewing organizations from
the exclusive perspective of the administrator-manager, func-
tional agent of an administered system, whose purpose it is
to ensure the "survival, growth, profitability of the organi-
zation" (Boje, 2002) and to "satisfy the immediate demands
of shareholders, customers and (to some extent) workers"
(Alvesson & Willmott, 1996, p. 161). Managerialist ideology
became apparent in early 1900s, when corporate capitalism
superseded family (entrepreneurial) capitalism. Max Weber
(1947) infused managerialism with a masculine and paternal-
istic ethic (Martin & Knopoff, 1995). Marcuse (1964) viewed
managerialism as being decidedly functionalist, as it signifies
the shift from the owner to the professional manager and by
that it helps to legitimate the control of individuals, societ-
ies, and their organizations in the interest of capital (Davis,
1997). For Enteman (1993), managerialism is an upcoming
ideology that describes the fact that executives are endowed
with a responsibility to balance the interests of all stakehold-
ers and, by being responsible to everyone, end up accountable
to hardly anyone but themselves.
