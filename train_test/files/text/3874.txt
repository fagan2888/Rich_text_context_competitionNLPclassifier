Introduction
Organizational culture has been recognized as an essential
influential factor in analyzing organizations in various con-
texts. Its importance to establish competitive advantages
(e.g., Barney, 1986; Cameron & Quinn, 2005) or its impact
on organizational performance (e.g., Gordon & DiTomaso,
1992; Marcoulides & Heck, 1993; Wilkins & Ouchi, 1983)
has engaged scholars for many years. For example, Cameron
and Quinn (2005) emphasize that the success of organiza-
tions is not only determined by specific external conditions,
for example, barriers to market entry, rivalry in the industry,
and supplier and buyer power (see also Porter, 1985). They
conclude that the remarkable and sustained success of some
U.S. companies (e.g., Southwest Airlines, Wal-Mart, etc.)
"has had less to do with market forces than with company
values" (Cameron & Quinn, 2005, p. 4).
The increased interest in culture has led to the develop-
ment of different theories/models/frameworks aiming at
explaining organizational culture (e.g., Hall, 1976; Hofstede,
Neuijen, Ohayv, & Sanders, 1990; Sagiv & Schwartz, 2007;
Schein, 1985) and its impact on as well as relevance for orga-
nizations. However, this plethora of cultural frameworks,
sometimes tied to specific contexts or phenomena, "perpetu-
ates the lack of a paradigm and is a hindrance to accumula-
tion of knowledge" (Tsui, Nifadkar, & Ou, 2007, p. 461).
Tsui et al. (2007) conclude from their extensive literature
review that the development of a configuration model (see
also Meyer, Tsui, & Hinings, 1993) would be necessary to
further increase the construct validity of culture. Meyer et al.
(1993) refer to organizational configuration as "any multidi-
mensional constellation of conceptually distinct characteris-
tics that commonly occur together. Numerous dimensions of
environments, industries, technologies, strategies, structures,
cultures, ideologies, groups, members, processes, practices,
beliefs, and outcomes have been said to cluster into configu-
rations, archetypes, or gestalts" (p. 1175). Thus, a configura-
tion model of organizational culture needs to account for the
multidimensionality and complexity of organizations, which
calls for a multidisciplinary approach.
In a recent special issue of the Academy of Management
Review (AMR) on "Where are the New Theories of
Organization?" Smith and Lewis (2011) stress that prevailing
theories of management and organizations are not able to
fully capture organizational dynamics or change and their
adherent complexity. Similarly, Ployhart and Vandenberg
(2010) emphasize the need to consider time and change in
developing models, to consider the inherent effect of change
over time on causal relationships between two constructs. In
line with Maxwell and Cole (2007), they conclude that

A Configuration Model of Organizational
Culture
Daniel Dauber1, Gerhard Fink2, and MauriceYolles3
Abstract
The article proposes a configuration model of organizational culture, which explores dynamic relationships between
organizational culture, strategy, structure, and operations of an organization (internal environment) and maps interactions
with the external environment (task and legitimization environment).A major feature of the configuration model constitutes
its well-defined processes, which connect the elements of the model systematically to each other, such as single- and double-
loop learning, operationalization of strategies, legitimization management, and so on.The model is grounded in a large review
of literature in different research areas and builds on widely recognized models in the field of organization and culture
theory. It constitutes a response to the call for new models, which are able to explain and facilitate the exploration of the
empirical complexity that organizations face today. The configuration model of organizational culture is of particular interest
to scholars who investigate into cultural phenomena and change over time.

"cross-sectional research will often provide little insight into
how a variable will change over time and may quite often
lead to inaccurate conclusions" (Ployhart & Vandenberg,
2010, p. 96). Due to the fact that organizational culture is a
relatively young field of research, most models have not yet
been able to map organizational culture change over time by
considering other organizational constructs (e.g., strategy or
structure) as well as existing empirical findings from other
related disciplines. Organizational culture is often treated as
a variable with a linear relationship to other variables (e.g.,
Hofstede et al., 1990) from a static and functionalistic point
of view. Drawing on two exemplary reviews (Ilies, Scott, &
Judge, 2006; Vancouver, Thompson, & Williams, 2001),
Ployhart and Vandenberg (2010) stress that empirical studies
produce controversial results with the same data set, when
time/change is introduced and measured as a separate vari-
able. Thus, theoretical models should also be able to explain
or at least indicate how and when certain variables change
over time to provide meaningful, comprehensive, and accu-
rate conclusions for scholars who wish to investigate into
organizational culture and its impact on other constructs
reflecting organizational phenomena.
A major contribution of this article is the introduction of
well-defined processes, that is, feedback loops that explain
how and why organizational culture and other domains of an
organization (e.g., strategy, structure) might change. We will
show that existing models tend to provide rather static, linear
and/or ambiguous relationships and therefore seem less reli-
able in explaining organizational dynamics and complexity
as described by Ployhart and Vandenberg (2010) or Smith
and Lewis (2011). For the most part, this is due to the lack of
explanations for links between elements of models. If we
consider the relationship between strategy and structure, we
might not only be interested in how these "fit" each other to
allow for a proper operational functioning of an organiza-
tion but also investigate into those processes, which trigger
change toward or away from "fit." Looking between the
"boxes" of a model and focusing on the "arrows," which
connect them, should, at least, be equally appreciated by
scholars (see also Whetten, 1989).
By discussing and synthesizing relevant research in the
field of cultural and organizational studies, we address the
aforementioned issues and conclude with a configuration
model of organizational culture. The applicability of this
model falls into the realm of organizational culture, strategy-
structure research, as well as organizational behavior, in
which it is rooted.
First, we will discuss the crucial difference between soci-
etal culture and organizational culture as well as their rela-
tionship and relevance for the understanding of the proposed
model. Next, we review recognized organizational culture
models or models including organizational culture as an
important component in light of (a) relative "completeness"
of existing theories (see also Dubin, 1978; Kaplan, 1964;
Whetten, 1989), (b) relative ability to explain change over
time (see also Ployhard & Vandenberg, 2010), and (c) explan-
atory power with respect to cross-level relationships (e.g.,
internal­external environment relationships; see also Tsui
et al., 2007). The review of literature closes by showing
how the presented theories and models meaningfully com-
plement each other as well as how they contribute to the
development of the presented model. This is followed by a
step-by-step development of the configuration model of
organizational culture, which is based on theoretical con-
siderations of Schein (1985) and Hatch and Cunliffe (2006).
In line with findings of related research, the dynamic rela-
tionships between four central and recurring organizational
characteristics, that is, domains (organizational culture,
strategy, structure, and operations) will be explained. The
article closes with a discussion on how the model (a) contrib-
utes to a better understanding of organizational culture and
(b) can improve future research on organizational phenom-
ena. We will support our ideas by referring to a recent empir-
ical study on organizational culture change in acquisitions,
which provides first insights into the reliability and useful-
ness of the suggested model. The presented configuration
model of organizational culture is tailored to the needs of
cross-cultural research scholars who wish to investigate into
cross-level phenomena in organizations and change pro-
cesses alike. As such, it emphasizes reciprocity and interde-
pendencies of organizational constructs.
Organizational CultureTheory
and OrganizationTheory Revisited
The concept of organizational culture has its major roots in
culture theory. Among the most popular publications in the
field of cultural studies are those of Alvesson (2002);
Chhokar, Brodbeck, and House (2007); Denison, Haaland,
and Goelzer (2004); Hatch (1993); Hofstede (1980); Hofstede
et al. (1990); and House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, and
Gupta (2004). Their seminal work deals with various dimen-
sions of societal and organizational culture or concentrates
on leadership practices in organizations and uses a distinct
set of team or group leadership dimensions that are of high
relevance for organizational cultures. Organizational culture,
as a construct separable from societal culture, has been
subject to research for some decades, and various models
can be found across different disciplines. Generally,
approaches to organizational culture can be classified into
three categories: (a) dimensions approach (e.g., Chatterjee,
Lubatkin, Schweiger, & Weber, 1992; Hofstede et al., 1990;
Sagiv & Schwartz, 2007), (b) interrelated structure approach
(e.g., Allaire & Firsirotu, 1984; Hatch, 1993; Homburg &
Pflesser, 2000; Schein, 1985), and (c) typology approaches
(e.g., Cartwright & Cooper, 1993; Handy, 1993). The dimen-
sions approach strongly focuses on measuring organiza-
tional culture empirically along (in some cases bipolar)
scales that can be related to other, mostly dependent, vari-
ables of interest (see also Tsui et al., 2007). Interrelated
Dauber et al. 3
structure approaches concentrate on linking the concept of
organizational culture to other constructs or characteristics
of organizations and less to single variables. Therefore, they
often represent the theoretical underpinning for empirical
research designs. This approach tends to be multidisci-
plinary in nature, which commonly characterizes configura-
tion models (Meyer et al, 1993). Typology approaches are
based on predefined key characteristics that divide and
cluster organizations into certain categories, not necessarily
defining the relationship of these characteristics to each
other. Meyer et al. (1993) note that "the allocation of orga-
nizations to types often is not clear-cut. Because of their a
priori nature and frequent lack of specified empirical refer-
ents and cutoff points, typologies are difficult to use empiri-
cally" (p. 1182). As we explicitly look at relationships
between constructs, so far typology approaches appear to
contribute little to our understanding of a configuration
model of organizational culture. Therefore, we will primar-
ily draw on dimensions and interrelated structure approaches
in the following sections. Nevertheless, the suggested model
might well serve for the development of specific organiza-
tional types, if this is desired or maybe even required by a
specific inquiry.
In the following, we clarify how and why societal culture
differs from organizational culture and review most common
organizational culture models that are frequently applied or
referred to by many scholars. By doing so, we highlight the
fundamental roots of our configuration model and outline the
basis of its theoretical foundation.
Societal CultureVersus Organizational
Culture: Related but Different Constructs
The dimensions approach is one of the most prominent
approaches to cultural constructs, in particular in quantitative
research. Conventional anthropological research designs have
partly lost ground due to the paradigm of culture dimensions
by Hofstede (1980, 2001) and paved the way for new research
contexts that are based on the quantitative measurement of
cultures. The popularity of Hofstede's five national culture
dimensions (power distance, individualism, masculinity,
uncertainty avoidance, long-term vs. short-term orientation)
can partly be "attributed to a simplification of the approach to
culture" (Fink & Mayrhofer, 2009, p. 49). Regarding organi-
zational culture, Hofstede et al. (1990) highlight that there is
a significant difference between national culture and organi-
zational culture. The latter is defined and conceptualized by
six dimensions of perceived practices and should not be con-
fused with national culture values.
While the dimensional model of organizational culture by
Hofstede et al. (1990) was initially derived from a large set
of narrative interviews and a consequent test with a question-
naire, Sagiv and Schwartz (2007) define the organizational
culture construct based on theoretical considerations. They
argue that organizational culture is influenced by the "sur-
rounding society," "personal value priorities of organizational
members," and "the nature of the organization's primary
tasks." Organizations are embedded into societies, which can
be defined by certain national culture values. Sagiv and
Schwartz (2007) argue that organizations operate under soci-
etal pressure. Therefore, organizations have to comply to
norms, values, and regulations of societies to be an accepted
member of this society and secure social and consequently
financial survivability. Organizations consist of individuals
who introduce their own value preferences into the organiza-
tion, which represents the "way people select actions, evalu-
ate people and events, and explain their actions and
evaluations" (Sagiv & Schwartz, 2007, p. 83), thus shape
organizational culture to a certain extent. Finally, Sagiv and
Schwartz (2007) add that tasks, which need to be achieved by
an organization, shape their cultural values as well. This
seems to coincide with what Hofstede et al. (1990) defined
as "perceived practices." Different tasks require different
organization and execution of activities, that is, different
strategies and structures. It seems obvious that a production
company differs severely from a service provider, or a state
agency from a private firm, not only with respect to final
products but also with respect to their organizational culture.
This is mainly due to the different nature of businesses, cli-
ents, and operating processes.
In view of the above, two quite important aspects have to
be taken into consideration when developing a configuration
model of organizational culture: (a) Organizational values sig-
nificantly differ from national or societal values and (b) orga-
nizationalvaluesareaffectedbysocietalvalues,organizational
members (personality, value preferences), and their tasks,
which require appropriate organizational actions to be
achieved. This interaction has to be illustrated and explained
by a configuration model of organizational culture, which
distinguishes between external environmental influences
(e.g., societal culture) and internal cultural environmental
influences (e.g., organizational culture). Although both pre-
sented approaches (Hofstede et al., 1990; Sagiv & Schwartz,
2007) allow for classifications of organizations, they have to
be considered as predominantly static. They provide limited
conclusions about organizational processes related to organi-
zational values and do not incorporate mechanisms that relate
to change of organizational cultures. Therefore, the next sec-
tion will discuss selected interrelated structure models that
consider culture in conjunction with other organizational con-
structs, for example, strategy, structure, and behavior, which
constitute another building block for the development of the
configuration model and add to its comprehensiveness.
Linking Organizational CultureTheory
and OrganizationTheory: Commonly
Related Concepts in the Literature
Existing research offers a great variety of models, which
attempt to explain relationships between organizational cul-
ture and related organizational constructs, for example,
4 SAGE Open
strategy and structure. However, not all of them seem to be
of equal relevance in research practice. For the development
of the configuration model, we concentrate on four exem-
plary models that appear to have been frequently selected as
a valid source of reference by many scholars: Schein (1985)
[6,686 times cited], Hatch (1993) [731 times cited], Allaire
and Firsirotu (1984) [672 times cited], and Homburg and
Pflesser (2000) [561 times cited] (Harzing's Publish or
Perish, http://www.harzing.com/pop.htm).
Schein's (1985) model of organizational culture is not
only one of the most cited culture models but also one that
serves a high degree of abstraction and complexity reduction.
It mainly consists of three domains: (a) basic underlying
assumptions, (b) espoused values, and (c) artifacts. Schein
(1985) distinguishes between observable and unobservable
elements of culture. From Figure 1, it becomes clear that
there is a certain hierarchy between these domains. Visible
behavior influences and is influenced by unobservable
assumptions through rules, standards, and prohibitions.
Hatch (1993) significantly extends Schein's (1985) model.
Not only does Hatch (1993) add a fourth domain, called
"symbols," she also defines the processes that link each ele-
ment of the organizational culture construct, which provides
a somewhat better understanding of interdependencies in
this model. Hatch (1993) assumes that there exist two pos-
sible ways how observable behavior emerges through under-
lying assumptions: (a) through "manifestation" into values
and "realization" into artifacts or (b) through "interpretation"
into symbols and through "symbolization" into artifacts (see
also Figure 1). Nevertheless, it remains unclear under which
conditions such processes take place and which factors deter-
mine the path for transformation of assumptions into arti-
facts, that is, when will assumptions become "manifested"
and "realized" and when are assumptions "interpreted" and
"symbolized."
Both models seem to explain cultural dynamics. Whereas
Schein (1985) focuses strongly on domains of organizational
culture, Hatch (1993) specifies four processes that link these
domains. For the development of a configuration model,
both approaches provide a simplified but limited perspective
on culture in organizations. This is due to the high level of
abstraction, which confines the explanatory power regarding
interdependencies between organizational culture and other
domains of an organization (e.g., strategy, structure, opera-
tions, etc.). The idea of external pressure on organizational
culture, that is, effects of the external environment, as pro-
posed by Sagiv and Schwartz (2007), is not replicable by
using Schein (1985) or Hatch (1993) because external effects
are not explicitly considered in their models. Still, they pro-
vide a meaningful basis for the development of an "internal
environment" of an organization. A comprehensive configu-
ration model of organizational culture, however, should not
only map internal processes guided by organizational culture
but also illustrate consequences of, for example, manifesta-
tion, realization, interpretation, and symbolization for the
external environment and vice versa.
Next, we present two models that address the role of the
external environment. Homburg and Pflesser (2000) aim at
developing a model that can be used to explain relationships
between organizational culture and performance outcomes.
They highlight that "market dynamism" (i.e., external envi-
ronment) moderates this relationship. Organizational culture
is defined similarly to Schein (1985) with three layers.
However, Homburg and Pflesser (2000) distinguish between
artifacts and behavior, which belong in this model to the
same layer. Whereas artifacts refer to "stories, arrangements,
rituals, and language" (Homburg & Pflesser, 2000, p. 450),
behavior is defined as "organizational behavioral patterns
with an instrumental function" (Homburg & Pflesser, 2000,
p. 450). Consequently, behavior does not influence, but is
influenced by, norms and artifacts. While this model and its
relationships had been empirically tested, the model does not
consider interaction, but only linear effects from culture to
performance. Organizational culture dynamics (i.e., cultural
change) as proposed by Ployhart and Vandenberg (2010) or
Smith and Lewis (2011) are not considered. The model has
limited explanatory power for effects of the external envi-
ronment on an organization and assumes no feedback

processes. This stands in contrast to considerations of Sagiv
and Schwartz (2007), who emphasize the close relationship
of and interaction between societal culture (i.e., external
environment, institutions) and organizational culture (i.e.,
internal environment, self-organization, self-reference,
identity).
The model developed by Allaire and Firsirotu (1984) rep-
resents the most complex approach to organizational culture
among those presented in this article. It covers several
aspects mentioned so far. First, it clearly distinguishes
between external (society, history, contingency) and internal
environment (cultural system, sociostructural system).
Second, it conveys that organizational values are influenced
by the external environment, but, at the same time, can be
identified as a separate culture system (as did Hofstede et al.,
1990). As can be seen from Figure 2, the sociostructural sys-
tem, including structure, strategies, policies, and processes,
stands in line with the culture system; that is, it should be
legitimized by myths, values, and ideologies. Allaire and
Firsirotu (1984) recognize "individual actors" who are seen
as the medium for organizational output and influence as
well as are influenced by the cultural and sociostructural sys-
tem. Furthermore, it can be concluded from this model that
organizational culture is influenced directly by the external
environment and by employees, who bring in their own per-
sonalities and perceptions of social values, rules, and norms
(see Sagiv & Schwartz, 2007). Nevertheless, the model
partly provides underspecified links between each element
of the model, especially among those that build the cultural
and sociostructural system. In contrast to Homburg and
Pflesser (2000), Allaire and Firsirotu (1984) recognize that
organizational output might have an impact on organiza-
tional culture, but leave this relationship unspecified (see
unconnected arrows in Figure 2). Thus, both presented
approaches can provide answers to "What are the factors that
should be considered in a configuration model?" but provide
only limited insights in "how" these factors are linked to
each other, what normally is described as "using arrows to
connect the boxes" in a visualized model (Whetten, 1989,
p. 491). According to Whetten (1989), it is necessary to
properly define processes linking each element of a model to
make it comprehensive, meaningful, and applicable for
scholars conducting empirical research.
In light of this review, we identify recurrent domains of
organizational culture that should be represented by a con-
figuration model: (a) value and belief system capturing the
underlying assumptions of organizational behavior; (b) strategy,
representing the overall orientation toward task achievement
and impacts on structures and activities of an organization
(According to classic strategic management, strategies
define what should be done, whereas structures and opera-
tional activities illustrate how things should be done); (c)
structural system, reflecting the manifestation of values and
beliefs as norms, rules, and regulations, which build the
frame of reference for organizational processes and patterns
of behavior, and stand in line with a predefined strategy; (d)
organizational activities/operations/actions, that is, patterns
of behavior, as the observable manifestation of values, strat-
egies, and structures; and (e) external environment as an
influential factor through evaluation processes on organiza-
tional culture and the internal environment of the whole
organization at large.
These five domains are also represented by the model of
Hatch and Cunliffe (2006; see Figure 3). Here, all domains
are linked with each other, and no specific processes are
identified. Considering Whetten (1989), this indicates a
somehow incomplete model as links between domains are
ambiguous and undefined. The following sections are less
concerned with the discussion and definition of constructs to
be included in a configuration model of organizational

culture. This has been subject to investigation for many
years. Our major emphasis lies on how we can better under-
stand the relationships between these constructs in a single
and noncontradictory model.
Developing a Configuration Model
of Organizational Culture
The suggested configuration model distinguishes between
domains and processes. Whereas domains belong to certain
constructs, for example, organizational culture, strategy,
structure, and so on, processes link elements of a model to
each other; that is, they explain relationships between con-
structs. Thus, elements of the configuration model of organi-
zational culture need to refer to either a domain or a process.
According to Hatch and Cunliffe (2006), we can distinguish
between four elements or domains: (a) organizational culture
and identity; (b) organizational strategy; (c) organizational
design, structure, and processes; and (d) organizational
behavior and performance. Hatch and Cunliffe (2006) also
refer to "strategic response to external environment."
However, responding clearly refers to a certain form of
action, namely, reaction to a specific event. Thus, "strategic
response to external environment" denominates a process,
which links the organization to its external environment.
Relationships of the internal and external environment will
be discussed in a later section of this article.
Whereas the model of Hatch and Cunliffe (2006) suggests
multiple but undefined interactions between specific domains,
Schein (1985) suggests particular relationships between three
rather broad domains. By conflating these two approaches,

Dauber et al. 7
we can achieve a more comprehensive model. As is shown in
Figure 4, it is possible to allocate all four domains of Hatch
and Cunliffe (2006) to the general domains of Schein's
(1985) dynamic model of organizational culture.
Following Schein (1985), "organizational culture" repre-
sents underlying, unobservable assumptions, which constitute
the basis for every organization. "Organizational strategy" pro-
vides rules, norms, and regulations, which are set into effect
through organizational structures. Therefore, strategy belongs
to an unobservable domain and can be allocated to "espoused
values." "Organizational design, structure, and process" as
well as "organizational behavior and performance" are those
elements of an organization that are visible to its members as
well as the external environment; that is, they represent arti-
facts. However, we have to exclude "processes" because these
are defined as relationships between domains.
The presented basic structure of relationships, which indi-
cates a clear order of domains and processes, bears the oppor-
tunity to connect to several existing fields of research to
concretize these domains and processes. Through synthesiz-
ing existing research in the field, we aim at a more compre-
hensive, well-defined, and empirically testable configuration
model of organizational culture.
The Relationship Between Organizational
Behavior/Performance and Organizational
Structure
Behavior/performance unfolds as observable manifestations
(phenomena) of predefined strategies as regulated by organi-
zational structures. This domain puts into effect patterns of
behavior, derived from strategies and structures. It makes an
organization's existence as a market player visible. Successful
operations lead to profits, thus constitute economic surviv-
ability of an organization.
Structures are the manifestation of strategic orientations
and regulate information flows, decision making, and patterns
of behavior, that is, the "internal allocation of tasks, decisions,
rules, and procedures for appraisal and reward, selected for
the best pursuit of . . . [a] strategy" (Caves, 1980, p. 64). Level
of hierarchy and control in an organization can, among other
issues, be identified in this domain. Structures develop due to
the need to organize behavior in a meaningful way and pro-
vide orientation for organizational members to set actions that
comply with organizational strategy, organizational culture,
and, as a result, accepted patterns of behavior.
In line with Schein (1985), organizational structures and
behavior constitute the observable manifestation of organi-
zational strategies (espoused values). From Figure 5, it can be
concluded that organizational structure and organizational
behavior are directly linked to each other as they both refer to
artifacts. Thus, structures build the frame of reference for run-
ning organizational operations and guide or cushion behavior
of members of an organization, which translate into certain
"patterns of behavior" supported by organizational struc-
tures. At the same time, behavior is also reversely linked to
structures. Here, we account for adjustment processes on the
level of artifacts. Considering that organizations might need
to change over time, for example, due to extensive interna-
tionalization via mergers and acquisitions (M&As), it may
become necessary to restructure certain or even all parts of
an organization. Especially in M&As, this seems of particu-
lar importance to align organizational behavior of new
employees in such a way that strategic goals can be accom-
plished efficiently and economically via organizational
tasks. Thus, structures need to change if organizational
behavior does not lead to the expected performance, for
example, on the market (Harris & Ruefli, 2000), identified
through "performance assessment." This might be coupled
with certain changes in strategy as well (see below). Missing
to change structures or operations would threaten economic
survivability of an organization if existing patterns of behav-
ior cannot sufficiently meet the requirements of organiza-
tional tasks and, therefore, cannot deliver the desired
performance.
Defining the Relationship Between
Strategy, Structure, and Operations
Strategies are commonly defined as the overall orientation
of an organization for reaching preset goals and objectives
(Chandler, 1962; Whittington, 2001), that is, a long-term
plan for maximizing profits (Caves, 1980) or covering costs,
in case of nonprofit organizations. Furthermore, organiza-
tional strategy "is an organization process, in many ways
inseparable from the structure, behavior and culture of the
company in which it takes place" (Andrews, 1971, p. 53).
Figure 5. Relationship between structure and behavior
8 SAGE Open
Strategies influence the interaction between structures and
behavior and vice versa. This conclusion derives naturally
from Schein (1985) who argues that "espoused values" have
an impact on "artifacts," which in turn influence "espoused
values." As organizational structures as well as behavior
were identified as elements of organizational artifacts, both
are affected by strategy. By considering this, we follow the
seminal work on strategy-structure-fit. Chandler's (1962)
famous postulation that "structure follows strategy" (p. 314)
can be considered as a starting point for this debate. He
empirically observed that organizations, after changes in
strategies, suffered from a phase of ineffectiveness. However,
after structural changes were achieved, organizations started
to become more profitable again. Similar conclusions have
been drawn by several other scholars or implicitly refer to
such a causal link (e.g., Andrews, 1971; Ansoff, 1965;
Donaldson, 1987, 1996; Hamilton & Shergill, 1992, 1993;
Williamson, 1975). Therefore, we can infer that different
strategies require different structures (Stopford & Wells,
1972; Wolf & Egelhoff, 2002). In contrast, structures pro-
vide the frame of reference for future information processing
and strategic decision making, commonly known as "report-
ing." Thus, it is also true that structures have an impact on
future strategies (e.g., Child, 1972; Fredrickson, 1986;
Galbraith & Nathanson, 1978). In view of the above, we can
assume a feedback relationship between structure and strat-
egy as proposed by more recent research (Amburgey &
Dacin, 1994; Harris & Ruefli, 2000).
Processes that turn organizational strategies into action,
commonly known as "operationalization," "implementation
of strategies," or "strategy doing," unfold through organiza-
tional structures and organizational activities. Strategies are
put into effect through organizational structures and behav-
ior. With reference to "operationalization," it seems worth-
while to use the term "operations" instead of "organizational
behavior and performance" to emphasize that "behavior," in
this context, represents the observable outcome of "opera-
tionalizing" strategies. Operations might be oriented toward
the internal environment (inward-oriented operations) or
external environment (outward-oriented operations).
As mentioned above, strategies might be subject to
change. However, to be aware of the fact that strategies need
to change, it is necessary that organizations recognize defi-
cits in performance through performance assessment. While
the pure assessment of, for example, decreasing revenues,
does not necessarily lead to learning and changes in strate-
gies, we have to account for organizational learning as "pro-
cesses of detecting and correcting error" (Argyris, 1977,
p. 116). However, "learning" should not be confused with
"adaptation" (for a more detailed discussion, see Fiol &
Lyles, 1985). According to the emerging configuration
model of organizational culture, performance assessment
might lead to "adaptation" of structures. In contrast, only
through "learning," a change in strategy might take place.
Thus, assessing organizational performance might constitute
a trigger for learning but by no means should be understood
as an automatic sequence of processes. Organizations might
or might not learn from their mistakes. Dodgson (1993)
argues that only organizations that "purposefully construct
structures and strategies so as to enhance and maximize
organizational learning" (p. 377) can be considered as "learn-
ing organizations." There might be barriers to learning such
as "poor vertical communication" or "poor coordination of
functions, business or borders" as described by Beer and
Eisenstat (2000). Therefore, we devise that through perfor-
mance assessment (i.e., inward-oriented operations), changes
in strategy and structure can be triggered, but learning pro-
cesses rely on favorable organizational conditions such as
open communication structures, which would allow organiza-
tions to learn. Learning processes, representing "single-loop
learning" (Argyris, 1977) in this case, are processes that may
arise from performance assessment. Assessing the efficiency
of operations represents a binding condition for organiza-
tional learning that leads to changes in strategy. Single-loop
learning, as distinguished from double-loop learning, refers
to the processes of detecting errors and adjusting existing
strategies to meet new requirements. Double-loop learning,
by contrast, refers to a more profound process of learning,
where "underlying organizational policies and objectives"
(Argyris, 1977, p. 116), that is, underlying assumptions
(Schein, 1985), are questioned and changed. This is compa-
rable with what Fiol and Lyles (1985) describe as "lower-level
learning" and "higher-level learning." Figure 6 summarizes
the relationships between strategy, structure, and operations.

values, that is, strategy in the proposed model. As culture
is often defined as a set of guiding principles, we can illus-
trate this by arguing that culture affects the process of
operationalization. As a consequence, strategies are put into
effect through structures and operations by considering
cultural values, that is, underlying assumptions, held within
an organization. This results in the following conclusions:
(a) Operationalization has to stand in line with corporate val-
ues. (b) All domains--strategy, structure, and operations--
are indirectly affected by culture. (c) Organizational values
constitute the shared "ethics" of doing business. Considering
the hierarchical order established by Schein (1985), it
appears as if the impact of organizational culture on opera-
tions unfolds through strategy (i.e., espoused values), which
supports the idea of a "guiding" or moderating influence on
organizations during operationalization.
Schein (1985) highlights that espoused values (strategies)
have an impact on underlying assumptions. Translated into
the configuration model, another learning process has to be
considered: double-loop learning. As already mentioned
above, single-loop learning refers to the detection of errors
and the adjustment of strategies to overcome mistakes.
Double-loop learning, however, questions existing underly-
ing assumptions, that is, organizational culture, and may lead
to more fundamental changes in strategies and their opera-
tionalization. Although single-loop learning is a precondi-
tion for double-loop learning, it would be wrong to assume
that single-loop learning automatically effectuates double-
loop learning (Argyris, 1977). By contrast, Argyris and
Schön (1978) shows that many organizations are quite capa-
ble of single-loop learning, but fail to learn on a higher level,
that is, double-loop learning.
In conclusion, we can define a configuration model of
organizational culture that reflects internal processes of an
organization, linking organizational culture, strategy, structure,
and operations systematically to each other. In addition, we
sketched dynamic processes of an organization, which allows
to map change processes between all domains, determined by
well-defined processes (see Figure 7) derived from seminal
contributions to organization theory and organizational cul-
ture theory. These processes are interrelated in such a way
that conditions for change in domains can be systematically
traced and analyzed. For example, only through single-loop
learning changes in strategy formulation and operationaliza-
tion can take place. It is necessary to mention that changes in
strategy might also be triggered without single-loop learning.
However, it has to be assumed that successful and efficient
strategies have to reflect market opportunities (Porter, 1980,
1985) or unique internal resources of an organization, which
allowforcompetitiveadvantages(Barney,1991).Consequently,
adjustments in strategy are more likely initiated by unfavorable
changes in organizational performance than pure desire for
change.
Next, we have to consider that organizations are embedded
in various contexts, which can generally be called the "exter-
nal environment." Recalling the models cited in the beginning
of this article, in particular the model by Hatch and Cunliffe
(2006), we recognize that a differentiation between internal
and external environment is reasonable to determine processes
related to the organization itself and those related to the out-
side world, for example, society or market. Thus, we have to
further extend the model and consider the external environ-
ment as part of a configuration model of organizational cul-
ture, as suggested by Tsui et al. (2007).

Adding the Aspect of Environmental
Relationships to the Configuration
Model of Organizational Culture
We define external environment as "all elements outside the
boundary of the organization" (Daft, 2009) to which an orga-
nizationneedstoadapt(Aldrich&Pfeffer,1976).Organizations,
however, can also have an impact on their environment. While
the organizational environment can be viewed as "relatively
fixed conditions" (Gartner, 1985, p. 700), we opt for a rather
dynamic approach, which can account for rapid changes in
the environment as triggers for changes in organizations, at
least in the long run. As we aim at a configuration model of
organizational culture, which is valid in different contexts,
the potential model should be able to consider various envi-
ronments, for example, different industries. Therefore,
using solely either "the market" or "the society" as domains
for external environments would limit the model to these
contexts. To avoid overgeneralization, we identify two dif-
ferent and distinguishable external environments to which
an organization is fundamentally linked: legitimization
environment and task environment (following Donnelly-
Cox & O'Regan, 1999).
Legitimization environment refers to all stakeholders of
an organization, as defined by Freeman (1984). Thus, orga-
nizations are legitimized by and need to justify their activi-
tiestoseveralgroupsofstakeholders,forexample,customers,
shareholders, employees, suppliers, and so on, which some-
times may even pursue conflicting interests. This is what is
commonly understood as institutionalism (e.g., DiMaggio &
Powell, 1994; Scott, 2008). We understand legitimacy as "a
generalized perception or assumptions that the actions of an
entity are desirable, proper or appropriate within some
socially constructed system of norms, values beliefs and
definitions" (Suchman, 1995, p. 574). Child (1972) high-
lights that organizations do not only reflect their "members'
goals, motives or needs," but are to some extent dependent
on goals, motives, and needs of the external environment.
With reference to society, as a rather general group of stake-
holders, we identify the notion of "pressure" originating
from national culture. Sagiv and Schwartz (2007) argue that
organizations are operating under social pressure and have to
operate in line with societal values to be accepted as a mem-
ber of society. The idea of "social pressure" on an organiza-
tion had already been mentioned by Parsons (1960) and
Meyer and Rowan (1977). Thus, we can conclude that orga-
nizational culture is affected by national culture in two ways:
(a) through society and (b) through employees who bring in
their own perception of national values (see also Sagiv &
Schwartz, 2007). In view of the above, organizational cul-
ture legitimizes strategies, structures, and operations but
needs to stand in line with societal values. Consequently,
organizational culture shares to some extent similar values
with those held by stakeholders. Whereas organizational val-
ues partly reflect societal values, organizational culture can
significantly be distinguished from national culture (Hofstede
et al. 1990), as organizational culture is also determined by
strategy, structure, and operations. Based on these conclu-
sions, there are two important aspects that need to be mapped
by a configuration model of organizational culture: (a) a sepa-
rate domain that represents the "legitimization environment"
and (b) two processes that link this domain to the organiza-
tion, namely, "pressure of legitimization" and "legitimization
management"--The latter assures stakeholders that the orga-
nization operates in a way "that is consistent with societal
beliefs" (Donnelly-Cox & O'Regan, 1999, p. 17) and helps to
influence regulating institutions.
Task environment is what mostly likely could be associ-
ated with "the market." However, we abstain from using the
term "market," as organizations may pursue different opera-
tions related to several markets or even activities that are
only loosely linked to "markets," for example, voluntary
support of elderly or handicapped people. Generally, organi-
zations develop strategies to achieve certain tasks that are
either profitable or, at least, constitute financial survivability.
Thus, organizational structures need to account for certain
levels of performance (Child, 1972). For example, whereas
nonprofit organizations aim at equaling expenditures with
revenues and donations, for-profit organizations intend to
generate revenues that exceed their expenditures, resulting in
a profit/surplus. Consequently, operations (as determined in
our model) are directed at the successful accomplishment of
tasks, performed by a given organizational structure. From
this, we can conclude that operations are directly linked to
the task environment in two ways: (a) through "actions,"
determined as a coupling of structures and operations and
(b) through "market feedback" as a response to organiza-
tional operations. As operations are strongly linked to struc-
tures, these structures indirectly influence the link between
operations and task environment. This is an essential point,
as structures cannot meet tasks by themselves, but rather ful-
fill a supportive and guiding (or controlling) function for
operations. At the same time, the external environment can
by no means directly change organizational structures. A
change in structures is always implemented by internal
activities, that is, inward-oriented operations. Consequently,
through internal performance assessment, the external envi-
ronment can indicate a need for change of organizational
structures and by that trigger a change process. Structures are
defined and set up by organizations and are directed at task
achievement in the task environment or legitimization man-
agement as a response to cultural pressure of stakeholders.
Figure 8 provides the final configuration model of organiza-
tional culture, which considers the internal as well as the
external environment.
In view of the above, we can argue that organizations are
partly shaped by their external environment. This is not a
new finding. Thompson (2003) emphasizes that organizations
differ among and within them. In particular, he describes that
characteristics of environments, such as level of uncertainty
Dauber et al. 11
and complexity, require different forms of organizations. With
respect to variation within organizations, he postulated that
(1) all organizations are, by their nature, open to the
environment, (2) all organizations must adapt to their
environments by crafting appropriate structures, but
(3) organizations are differentiated systems, and some
components or sub-units are designed to be more
open--and some are more closed--to environmental
influences than others. (Thompson, 2003, xix-xxx)
These assumptions also hold for our configuration model
of organizational culture. The model can illustrate different
types of organizations and clearly defines structures and
operations as being more open and affected by the environ-
ment than strategies, which change only through learning
processes. In line with Open Systems Theory, we argue that
each organization is an open system that needs to stand in a
dynamic equilibrium with the environment (Richard, 1992;
Donelly-Cox & O'Regan, 1999). This is mapped in our con-
figuration model of organizational culture, as changes in any
domain necessarily lead to a process of response to this
change, irrespective of the effectiveness and efficiency of the
response or the respective processes.
Applicability andValue of
the Configuration Model of
Organizational Culture
The presented configuration model should be understood
as a first step toward a more holistic (see also Tsui et al.,
2007) and dynamic approach to organizational culture,
that is, accounts for change over time (e.g., Mitchell &
James, 2001; Ployhart & Vandenberg, 2010). In the fol-
lowing, we discuss how the presented model meets these
criteria and adds value to our understanding of organiza-
tional culture and processes of organizational culture
change.
Understanding organizational processes =
understanding organizational (culture) change =
understanding organizational (culture) dynamics
The configuration model of organizational culture
emphasizes the need to understand processes and domains
alike to fully grasp the nature of organizational culture
dynamics. We foregrounded in the model that change, a
major theme of this model, is a process, which hardly can
be reflected by domains, except by collecting data at dif-
ferent points in time. However, the innate problem of col-
lecting time series data about domains is its incapability to
investigate in change as a separate variable, which can be
further investigated or even classified. Thus, treating
change as a black box and comparing two states of a
domain at different times might not provide any insights
into how efficient such a change process has been, although
the final result might have yielded a better organizational
performance. The configuration model of organizational
culture provides the basis for running such analysis,
assuming that organizational learning processes can trig-
ger change, and "guidedance", "operationalization", and
"patterns of behavior" shape change toward a new state of
domains, for example, a shift from an international divisional
Figure 8. Configuration model of organizational culture: Internal and external environment
12 SAGE Open
structure to a global matrix. This allows conducting research
related to functions or dysfunctions of such processes
conjointly.
The call for more dynamic models is largely attributed to
the accelerated dynamic changes in the external environ-
ment. Organizations may differently respond to such changes.
We highlighted that the capability to adjust or even learn
from changes in the market can considerably shape the future
of an organization. Lack of organizational learning and pri-
mary emphasis on adjustment processes could threaten long-
termstrategicgoalsorevenfinancialsurvivability.Conducting
research on whether strategies or structures meet require-
ments of the external environment are important to identify
the urgency for change. Still, managers as well as scholars
would remain rather shortsighted by (a) considering a poten-
tial mis-"fit" between organizational domains and the external
environment only and (b) neglecting the need to understand
why or why not change processes are more or less success-
ful. The configuration model of organizational culture aims
at making this explicit by providing meaningful explana-
tions for relationships between organizational constructs.
The importance of organizational processes is not necessar-
ily new to the field of organization theory; however, respec-
tivemodels,whichtendtoincludethenotionoforganizational
culture, tend to undervalue the role of processes in shaping
organizational life and performance. As was highlighted in
the introductory sections of this article, attempts to synthe-
size different research areas in organization studies or cul-
tural studies have been rare and somewhat incomplete.
Dauber (2011), who applied the configuration model of
organizational culture, investigated into the blending of differ-
ent organizational cultures, also known as "hybridization"
(Dauber & Fink, 2009). With the help of the proposed model, it
was possible to show effects deriving from partial accultura-
tion, that is, integration, assimilation, separation, and margin-
alization of domains (see also Berry, 1980; Haspeslagh &
Jemison, 1991). Existing research on acculturation modes in
post-M&A processes recognized only differences in social and
structural integration (e.g., Björkman, Stahl, & Vaara, 2007;
Burgelman & McKinney, 2006; Puranam, Singh, & Chaudhuri,
2009; Puranam, Singh, & Zollo, 2006; Puranam & Srikanth,
2007; Stahl & Voigt, 2008; Waldman & Javidan, 2009).
Dauber (2011) finds that assimilation or integration of struc-
tures and strategies seemed to be a relatively easy task for the
acquirer in the respective case studies. However, the harmoni-
zation of conflicting values and beliefs caused considerable
misbehavior, that is, resistance by acquired employees.
Ineffective organizational culture change processes resulted
in financial losses by the companies involved, although tar-
get companies were successfully "integrated" with respect to
their strategy, structure, and operations, that is, their domains
but not their processes. Considering the data in light of the
configuration model of organizational culture, it became clear
that sensemaking processes (reflected by single- and double-
loop learning) are strongly shaped by previous corporate
values and determined the way change was perceived and
treated by the two parties involved. Different values became
a barrier to mutual learning from each other. Whereas adjust-
ment processes formally seemed to be successful, that is,
implemented rules reflected by structures were the same,
learning processes were not. Thus, sensemaking of new rules
within the target companies was different, difficult, or even
failed, which caused considerable confusion and frustration
among employees. This example conveys that differences in
organizational processes appear to be at least as important as
differences in domains. Nevertheless, more research is
required to fully understand the value of these certainly prom-
ising preliminary findings.
CopingWith Multidimensionality,
Holism, and Complexity
In line with Tsui et al. (2007), models of culture and organi-
zational culture, respectively, need to be further developed
to be applicable in different contexts as well as consider
effects from different levels of analysis. They emphasize that
developing a polycontextual model is a challenge, because
we need to draw on and understand different research disci-
plines to gain more holistic insights into cultural effects on
certain constructs of interest. Following this advice, we
elaborated the presented configuration model in such a way
that it confirms past empirical research and connects to dif-
ferent fields of organization research, for example, organiza-
tional culture, strategy-structure fit research, organizational
behavior, organizational learning, and so on. By integrating
commonly known classes of (sometimes competing) theories
or research findings, which enjoy widespread acceptance, the
presented configuration model clearly reaches beyond exist-
ing organizational culture models (e.g., Hatch & Cunliffe,
2006; Schein, 1985), which concentrate on particular ele-
ments or facets of organizational culture.
The proposed model suggests cross-level interdependen-
cies, for example, relationships between internal and external
environment. While some existing models vaguely indicate
this relationship (e.g., Allaire & Firsirotu, 1984; Hatch &
Cunliffe, 2006; Homburg & Pflesser, 2000), they provide
only limited insights in how such relationships are shaped or
determined. Considering the "how" criterion of Whetten
(1989), parts of those models presented at the beginning of
this article do not fully meet this requirement, that is, certain
elements of the model are rather ambiguously related to each
other. A strength of the configuration model of organizational
culture is its ability to overcome this constraint to a large
extent. In light of cybernetic systems approaches like those of
Beer (1989), Stopford and Wells (1972), and Yolles (1999,
2006), theoretical validation of the model is possible. The
cybernetic nature of the model allows drawing conclusions
for cross-level analyses. The configuration model represents
a "holon," that is, it meets the conditions of representing a
whole system, in this case an organization. Thus, the same
Dauber et al. 13
model applies to the whole organization and to each of its
distinct subunits, for example, marketing department, finance
department, and so on. This model can be used to compare
different parts of an organization (departments, teams, groups)
by using multiple configuration models of organizational cul-
ture, for example, exploring the level of "culture-fit" between
an organization's overall culture and its subcultures. Cultural
difference within the organization, for example, different cul-
tural perceptions of mangers (as a group) and staff (as a
group), might have a considerable bearing for organizational
performance. However, it would also be possible to replace
the interaction with domains of the external environment by
another organization (i.e., another "internal" environment) to
illustrate interorganizational relationships. An empirical
example of how two configuration models of organizational
culture might interact with each other is provided by Dauber
(2011) on post-M&A integration processes. In terms of the
configuration model, an acquisition represents the "integra-
tion" of a small part of the external environment (i.e., another
organization) into the internal environment. Research in this
area can be expected to produce new knowledge about orga-
nizations and their functioning.
Compared with previous models, the configuration model
of organizational culture appears to be more complex, but
still systematic and logical. We believe that oversimplifica-
tion of models rather harms our efforts to explore or explain
social phenomena, such as organizational culture dynamics.
With the advent of new research methods, particularly driven
by computer-aided tools of data collection and analysis, such
complex models find their applicability in a meaningful and
feasible way. At the same time, it has to be accepted that for
research on linear relationships, simpler models might
equally serve as a theoretical base to illustrate unidirectional
effects. However, scholars interested in change and recipro-
cal relationships between constructs might more likely
appreciate the configuration model of organizational culture
as their preferred frame of reference.
Concluding Remarks
In this article, we aimed at extending knowledge about orga-
nizational cultures, strategies, structures, and operations by
introducing meaningful relationships, that is, defining pro-
cesses between them. We are aware of the fact that these
first results based on reviewing existing research as well as
first empirical results can only be labeled as "promising
evidence" for heading into the right direction. There is still
much more fieldwork required to evaluate the proposed
relationships.
Our intentions were less concerned with showing that
other models are not applicable or meaningful. Most of them
have proven to be very valuable in the past within their
respective fields. However, the request for more dynamic,
multidimensional (e.g., Ployhart & Vandenberg, 2010; Smith
& Lewis, 2011) and multidisciplinary (Tsui et al., 2007)
approaches to organization studies calls for new models,
which can fulfill these criteria. Our approach was strongly
driven by reviewing existing theories and empirical investi-
gations to identify whether existing models already capture
the notions of change and processes related to organizational
culture. We came to the conclusion that recognized models
are most of the time limited in their applicability in complex
and dynamic settings, simply because they were not neces-
sarily designed for such contexts. The proposed configura-
tion model of organizational culture appreciates existing
research, but also provides new avenues for investigations
into current and possibly future phenomena which might be
partly driven by factors that were of less importance in the
past. The presented models show great potential for synthe-
sis into a single and probably more contemporary model,
which appreciates "change" as a common phenomenon
within societies and economies.
A major emphasis in developing the configuration model
was to spotlight processes that explain how widely accepted
constructs, such as strategy and structure, are related to orga-
nizational culture as well as organizational culture change.
We identified six processes related to the internal environ-
ment of an organization, three of which are related to forward
processes, that is, the manifestation of domains through guid-
ance, operationalization, and patterns of behavior.Another set
of three processes is related to organizational change and
learning: adjustment processes, single-loop learning, and
double-loop learning. Besides, we modeled relationships
between the internal and external environment (task and legit-
imization environment). Two fundamental processes of inter-
acting with the external environment were identified (action
and legitimization management). As a response to "action"
and "legitimization management," we elaborated the notion
of "market feedback" and "cultural pressure." Depending on
the degree of cultural pressure, an organization might have to
engage in legitimization management. Likewise, in case of
bad market feedback, an organization will have to consider
altering its actions through change within the internal envi-
ronment. We encourage scholars to investigate not only into
relationships between organizational cultures, strategies, and
structures but also into the innate dynamics of these pro-
cesses as suggested by the configuration model of organiza-
tional culture.
Questions related to complex social phenomena often
require rather complex answers. The configuration model of
organizational culture serves a higher degree of complexity
compared with other models but remains within the bound-
aries of comprehensiveness due to its strong ties to existing
research. Besides, the model does not favor a specific meth-
odological paradigm; it can be applied in quantitative, quali-
tative, and mixed-methods designs to test hypotheses or to
explain or explore organizational phenomena. Therefore the
applicability of the model is manifold. We provided one
example by referring to the qualitative study of Dauber
(2011) related to the context of M&As and organizational
14 SAGE Open
culture change. However, also quantitative studies based on
time series data might provide interesting and enlightening
insights (see, for example, Ployhart & Vandenberg, 2010).
The configuration model of organizational culture consti-
tutes an important step forward to a more holistic, compre-
hensive, and interdisciplinary approach to cultural dynamics
in organizations and can serve as a meaningful reference to
build new knowledge about culture effects in organizations.
We do not claim that different streams of existing research
have taken a too narrow view on organizations and cultural
effects. However, just as much as we need to be aware of
what we are looking at when conducting organization studies
in a well-defined field, we should also be aware of what we
are not looking at and how this may affect our analysis, find-
ings, and conclusions.
