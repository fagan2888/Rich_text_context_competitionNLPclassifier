Introduction
Even though education for sustainable development (ESD)
has become an increasingly important part of preschool
(European Panel on Sustainable Development [EPSD],
2010; UNESCO, n.d.), there is still much research to be done
in the field (e.g., Ärlemalm-Hagsér, 2013; Davis, 2009). This
article contributes to the research by reporting on a study on
preschool children's possibilities to learn to act for sustain-
able development.
Researchers mainly define ESD in two different ways
(Scott & Gough, 2003). On one hand, some researchers focus
on the natural environment and stress that education should
use curricula both in and about the environment.1 On the
other hand, some stress that economic, social, and environ-
mental dimensions should be included in the curriculum.2
Even though both perspectives address research questions of
moral and political character in some way, the main differ-
ence between them could be described as while these ques-
tions are included implicitly in the first perspective, the
second always try to make them explicit. Important issues
for a sustainable future can involve every human's right to
get education or to have access to clean water. As there is not
one clear way to solve sustainability issues, there is a need to
be able to make value judgments to determine what actions
can result in an articulated goal.
In spite of the differences between perspectives and
approaches in the field of ESD research, a common point of
departure is the view that children are important actors for
change in the future (see, for example, EPSD, 2010). Hence,
one way to explore ESD is to investigate what action compe-
tence children need to participate in sustainable develop-
ment. Although the term action competence is used in
different ways by different researchers, most agree that the
concept includes knowledge about different action possibili-
ties, skills to investigate and discuss the different action pos-
sibilities and confidence to perform the actions.3
This article explores which actions are made relevant in
preschool educational settings. Analyzing how children
move forward in an activity makes it possible to grasp why
and how certain kinds of actions and competences become
relevant and others do not. In these analyses, it is also possi-
ble to discuss how the actions in the meaning-making pro-
cess prepare the children for future actions, that is, what
kinds of action competences they develop.
We will use an analytical approach developed and used in
a number of previous studies (e.g., Lidar, Lundqvist, &
Östman, 2006; Lundqvist, Almqvist, & Östman, 2009;
Rudsberg & Öhman, 2010). The approach is built on a prag-
matic perspective on meaning-making and a view on lan-
guage inspired by the late Wittgenstein (1953/1992,
1969/1992). From a pragmatic perspective, meaning-making
is a complex and dynamic process in which knowledge
undergoes change; knowledge grows and develops rather
than just accumulates (Dewey, 1938/1997). In the meaning-
making process, for example, when people interact there is a
need to make the situation at hand intelligible to be able to
move forward. A way to make situations intelligible is by
making connections between what a person encounters and

Teaching for Action Competence
Maria Hedefalk1, Jonas Almqvist1, and Malena Lidar1
Abstract
The focus of this article is to explore preschool children's possibilities to learn to act for sustainable development. The
purpose is to describe and analyze which actions are privileged when children participate in preschool activities. Analyses
of video recordings of everyday preschool activities show how children experience activities where they critically discuss
and make value judgments about actions. The results of the analyses also show how different actions become relevant in
different practices. Furthermore, comparisons are made between the preschool practices and three teaching principles within
education for sustainable development (ESD). In ESD, action competence is the ability to critically make value judgments
about different alternative ways to act for a sustainable future. The result shows how children make value judgments in
situations where facts are not sufficient for solving a problem.

his or her earlier experiences. In this way, participation in
past activities contributes to the formation of the present situ-
ation, at the same time as the present situation prepares for
future activities (cf.Almqvist et al., 2008; Lidar,Almqvist, &
Östman, 2010). Many of the actions that people perform are
habitual; people fall back on them because they have learned
the actions in earlier situations and because they do not see a
need to doubt them in the present activities (cf. Wittgenstein,
1953/1992, 1969/1992). This means that they do not have to
reflect on their actions but can act as they are used to in simi-
lar situations (Dewey, 1922/1988). In such cases, learning
can be understood as a gradual transformation of habits and
ways of acting. However, when the actors do not automati-
cally know how to move ahead in a situation, this creates
what can be called a "problematic situation" (Wickman &
Östman, 2002; Hedefalk et al., in press). When observing
interactions, these problematic situations are a window into
exploring how a situation is made meaningful and how the
participants are able to move forward and also--and central
to this article--which actions are considered appropriate in
educational settings.
Teaching Principles
In teaching activities, teachers have to make choices regard-
ing educational goals, content, and methods. These choices
reflect, among other things, which actions are relevant in the
practice. To be able to describe what kinds of actions are con-
sidered relevant in education, we introduce the concept
teaching principles. As a starting point, the principles are
built on previous research--mainly consisting of policy
analyses and interviews--on different teaching traditions in
the field of ESD (Sandell, Öhman, & Östman, 2005). We
also want to stress that there can be huge differences between
what is expected from politicians, policy makers, and teach-
ers on one hand and what happens in everyday teaching prac-
tices on the other. Therefore, the use of the concept teaching
principles in our analyses should be seen as a part of an
explorative approach where we are open to find new and
unexpected meaning-making processes.
Teaching for sustainable development can be categorized
into three teaching traditions based on different views on the
goals and content of ESD: the fact-based teaching tradition,
the normative teaching tradition, and the pluralistic teaching
tradition (Sandell et al., 2005; Skolverket, 2001; Sund &
Wickman, 2011; cf. Vare & Scott, 2007), all of which suggest
the teachers'various aims, content, and methods. Each teach-
ing tradition can be defined by the different actions that are
privileged in different teaching situations.
These three teaching traditions were described in analyses
in environmental education context (Sandell et al., 2005;
Skolverket, 2001). In this study, we take our point of depar-
ture from this categorization to discuss feasible consequences
when teaching in preschool. We develop an approach that
explores how different teaching principles would look in the
different traditions, specifically looking at what different
kinds of actions the teacher privileges.
The purpose is to look for all the three different kinds of
principles in a preschool context and discuss what these vari-
ous ways of teaching mean in relation to children's possibili-
ties to develop action competence for a sustainable
development.
The Fact-Based Teaching Principle
Characteristic of the fact-based teaching principle is that the
learners are expected to learn facts of some kind (Flogaitis,
Daskolia, & Agelidou, 2005; Östman, 1995; Sandell et al.,
2005; Vare & Scott, 2007). The idea is that to be able to act
for change, the children need to learn facts that they can use
as a base for their decision making; when they have learned
enough, they are also competent to act for change (cf. Östman
& Almqvist, 2011). Fact-based teaching means that children
interact in a way which results in the acquisition of suitable
facts about the issue in focus. Discussing values--for exam-
ple, different views on the relationship between man and
nature--is not relevant in teaching based on this principle
because the focus of the educational content is on finding the
correct description of the world (Sandell et al., 2005).
The Normative Teaching Principle
In the normative teaching tradition, moral issues are high-
lighted and teachers focus on questions about how to act
(Östman & Almqvist, 2011; Sund & Wickman, 2011).
However, the relevant values are decided beforehand and
seen as a central part of the educational content that should
be learned by the children.
The normative principle emphasizes learning predefined
values (Sandell et al., 2005; Vare & Scott, 2007). A pre-
defined value means that the content is built on a specific
view (held by, for example, scientists, stakeholders, organi-
zations, or political parties) that defines which actions should
be considered relevant.
In teaching built on this principle, discussing values is
regarded as irrelevant because the understanding is that the
predefined values form the correct answers. Students do not
need to value the teaching content, just learn it. Teachers
guided by this principle would acknowledge that there are
different ways to act and different answers to the same ques-
tions, but the principle dictates that only one--or very few--
of the answers is valid.
The Pluralistic Teaching Principle
As with the normative teaching principle, the content of the
pluralistic teaching principle includes moral questions, but
its main characteristic is that the children are expected to
learn how to critically make value judgments.4 Consequently,
in teaching built on this principle encourages the children
Hedefalk et al. 3
search for information as stakeholders using different
sources, such as the media and literature, to scrutinize and
discuss different views on the subject in focus. The learners
are expected to critically explore different views and come to
conclusions by themselves or together with others. It is also
possible for different children to find different solutions;
consensus is not always necessary.
Purpose
The aim of this article is twofold. First, the aim is to describe
and analyze which actions are made relevant in different pre-
school settings. The described activities show which action
competences the children will need to participate in particu-
lar practices. Second, the actions performed are compared
with those prioritized within the three different teaching
principles described above. This comparison makes it possi-
ble to discuss which action competences children develop in
Swedish early childhood education in relation to those called
for in ESD research.
In other words, the analyses will highlight the following
research questions:
Research Question 1: Which actions are privileged in
different preschool activities?
Research Question 2: What does this mean for children's
possibilities to develop action competences?
Method
Empirical Material
The empirical material consists of transcripts from video
recordings collected at a preschool in Sweden. The preschool
is situated on the outskirts of a city and surrounded by forest,
farm land, and meadows. Some of the children walk to the
preschool and some come by a vehicle, depending on how
close they live to the preschool. The ages of the children dif-
fer between the groups: Dundret has children aged 1 to 2
years, the children in Kebnekaise are 3 to 4 years, and the
children in Skanderna are 5 to 6 years. There are two staff
members working with every group, for a total of six
employees.
The study complies with Swedish research ethics. The
preschool teachers, parents, and children were asked for
informed consent before the project started, and all the par-
ticipants have been given fabricated names.
The video recordings, a total of 24 hr of film, were open-
ended and recorded during the mornings (between 9:00 a.m.
and noon) on 17 separate occasions in May and June 2010.
Since we are interested in analyzing children's discussions
with teachers and with each other, we have not in the analy-
ses included parts of the material were they are playing qui-
etly, walking in a line quietly, singing or listening to a teacher
reading from a book. In total, approximately 13½ hr of the
recordings were tran-scribed.
The analysis of the empirical material was conducted in
two steps:
Step 1: Practical epistemology analysis.In the first step, we
used practical epistemology analysis, where we analyzed the
problematic situations to find out how the children make the
situation meaningful. Wickman and Östman (2002) intro-
duced this approach analyzing science education at univer-
sity level. Stand fast is a central analytical concept in the
approach. Actions stand fast as valid for the participants in
the situation when performed without hesitation. In these
kinds of situations, the actions, such as the use of concepts,
are things that no one hesitates about; they are immediately
intelligible. Hence, there is no need to explain what needs to
be said or done.
However, when people are not sure about which action to
pursue, when a situation is not immediately intelligible, we
say that a gap appears (Wickman & Östman, 2002). The gap
is noticeable because the participants need to solve the prob-
lem before they can carry on the meaning-making.According
to Wickman and Östman (2002), most of the gaps are quickly
filled in an activity, but some linger, which means that the
participants do not immediately bridge them. To bridge the
gap, the children need to make the situation intelligible. The
analyses of meaning-making are thus descriptions of how the
gaps children encounter are bridged.
The first step of the analysis was to show what meaning-
making is done. In the analysis, the meaning-making
becomes evident when gaps appear; then, we present what
actions are performed to bridge the gaps.
In the analyses of the transcripts, we searched for "prob-
lematic situations," that is situations where the participants
hesitate or do not automatically know how to proceed. These
situations are keys to understanding how a situation is made
meaningful and what actions the participants performed to
be able to move forward. Meaning is situational--we do not
know beforehand what meaning will be created. The situa-
tions used in this article were chosen for their clarity of what
actions that are privileged in the situation.
Step 2: Comparison and potential consequences. In the second
step of the analysis, a comparative strategy was used. This is
done by associating the different actions that are described in
the first step with the three different teaching principles. The
identified gaps not only tell us what the children have learned
from prior experience but also how they solve problems.
Furthermore, we discuss the actions in relation to the
implications for children's possibilities to develop the action
competences that are sought after in ESD research. Different
actions are identified as relevant in different teaching prin-
ciples and give us a clue as to what kind of actions can be
performed within the different teaching contexts. This allows
us to identify actions in everyday preschool life and to dis-
cuss the potential consequences of the teaching principles for
the development of action competence as discussed within
ESD.

Results
We have found three different categories of actions used to
solve problematic situations participants encounter in the
preschool setting, suggesting which actions were privileged
in the situations. The categorization of these actions is made
in terms of "needs" that are required to bridge different kinds
of gaps: (a) the need to know what to focus on, (b) the need
for additional information, and (c) the need to make value
judgments.
In the following, we use a few empirical examples to
illustrate each category. The illustrations in the first step
show how the actors proceed to move forward in the situa-
tion. In the next step, the actions are compared with actions
that are privileged and agree with the different teaching
principles.
The Need to Know What to Focus On
Step 1: Practical epistemology analysis. Three children sit on a
rug with a volcano landscape motif on it, playing with plastic
dinosaurs and looking in a book about dinosaurs. In our anal-
ysis of their meaning-making process, we can see that it
becomes important for them to investigate whether the dino-
saurs are meat-eaters or plant-eaters.
Kasper wants to attack Karin's dinosaur but finds this dif-
ficult, because grass-eaters do not attack each other. The dis-
cussion about meat-eaters versus plant-eaters and their
attacks on each other goes on for quite a while.5 In one exam-
ple from their conversation, Kasper's dinosaur starts to attack
Karin's dinosaur by biting it. Kalle, who is watching them,
interrupts the play and tells them that Kasper's dinosaur is a
plant-eater and does not bite other dinosaurs. Kasper then
picks up another dinosaur and starts attacking Karin's dino-
saur again. As Kalle does not protest, we can assume that the
new dinosaur is considered to be a meat-eater.
In a sense, the children now have all the information they
need to move forward in their play. However, the question
about how to decide what dinosaur belongs to which group
lingers in their discussion. The children continue to investi-
gate and discuss differences between plant-eaters and meat-
eaters. A teacher, Kristina, enters the activity, sits down on
the rug, and helps the children to focus on something they
have not noticed before.6 She instructs the children to exam-
ine the mouth of one of the dinosaurs. According to the
teacher, the mouth and teeth are what the children should pay
attention to when determining whether the dinosaur is a
plant-eater or a meat-eater. Kasper answers by saying that
the dinosaur is a plant-eater, but without examining the
mouth. The teacher again directs the children toward the
mouth by saying, "Look in the mouth then." Kasper reacts to
the teacher's method of investigation by saying, "No, it is a
plant-eater." Karin follows the teacher's direction by exam-
ining the mouth and says that the mouth is pink. The teacher
then instructs the children to examine their own mouths by
feeling their teeth. Here, we can see that Kasper follows the
teacher's instructions, even though he knows another way to
decide what type of dinosaur he has in front of him.
Step 2: Comparison and potential consequences. In the empiri-
cal example, the children were told what to do to find an
answer to their query; they never had to critically evaluate
the actions. Consequently, the actions that are privileged in
this situation are in line with the fact-based teaching princi-
ple. In the empirical example, the need to know what to focus
on is solved by the teacher by directing the children's atten-
tion to the "appropriate" way of finding the answer. The
teacher directs the children's actions toward a scientific way
of finding out whether the dinosaurs are meat-eaters or plant-
eaters (by focusing on the teeth). It is not up to the children
to decide which actions might solve the problems because
this is done beforehand and corresponds to a scientific
method. This is of course not a surprise because they did not
encounter any problem where they would need to decide
what method is the best one to see whether the dinosaurs are
meat-eaters or plant-eaters. But let us see how the same
meaning-making situation can be understood in relation to
the two other teaching principles described above.
As described above, for actions to become relevant in the
normative or pluralistic teaching principles, the discussion
has to deal with moral and not just with epistemological
problems. In these situations, facts alone do not facilitate
moving forward in the situation. For example, in the situa-
tion in which the dinosaurs were categorized according to
what they ate, the moral problem of whether it is morally
defensible for living creatures to attack each other could
have arisen.
In the normative teaching principle, values are turned into
scientific facts. The idea is that it is possible for people to
find the right and good way to act by doing rational thinking
and investigations. In this particular case, the teacher could
have referred to the natural food chain. In a scientific dis-
course, it is rational and morally defensible for living crea-
tures to attack each other and a decision to become vegetarian,
for example, could be seen as irrational. Here, the value
judgment is made within a scientific discourse, and the chil-
dren are not involved in it.
In the pluralistic teaching principle, the participants are
expected to make value judgments about different perspec-
tives of the issue. Some might say that it is necessarily for
dinosaurs to attack each other, while others may not. The
children then need to critically discuss and value what they
think is morally right. In this case, science does not have the
only answer, and there are no predefined answers that deter-
mine which action is right.
The Need for Additional Information
Step 1: Practical epistemology analysis. In this empirical exam-
ple, the dinosaur activity described above continues.7 Karin
Hedefalk et al. 5
sits on the rug with Kasper and Karolina, and Kalle observes
them. They play with the dinosaurs by pushing them against
each other. Suddenly, Kalle shouts out and directs the other
children's attention toward a book. He points at a picture and
says, "Look, this one, look here how strange when there are
horns." Kasper notes that the dinosaur in his hand has horns,
and he places the dinosaur on top of the picture. "But this is
a meat-eater," Kalle says and points at the book. "That one is
not a meat-eater." He points at Kalle's plastic dinosaur.
A gap has appeared: Kalle has assumed that meat-eaters
do not have any horns, but the meat-eater in the book has
horns, which contradicts his earlier experiences. This makes
him doubt the new information. Kalle compares the dino-
saurs but cannot make sense of the pictures. Karolina and
Kasper look in the book and continue the activity by discuss-
ing that some dinosaurs have short horns and others have
long horns. However, they are unable to fill the gap, and they
start a new investigation.
Step 2: Comparison and potential consequences. In the empiri-
cal example outlined above, the actions that are privileged
agree with the fact-based teaching principle. The way to
bridge the gap is to understand the scientific facts in the
book.
Feasibly, a teacher could intervene in a situation as in the
situation above and turn the discussion about the dinosaur's
horn into a discussion about a moral problem and, thus, make
it relevant within the normative and pluralistic teacher tradi-
tions. This could, for example, involve a discussion about
whether a plant-eater or a meat-eater should use the horns
against each other or not. In the normative teaching princi-
ple, the teacher would then probably tell the children about
the use of the horns to stay within a scientific discourse. The
use of horns is then turned into a scientific question. The
children do not need to make value judgments because sci-
ence has already done it for them.
In the pluralistic teaching principle, however, it would be
relevant for the participants to consult different sources to
make value judgments and discuss different views on ani-
mals' uses of horns. Some might say that it is morally defen-
sible for dinosaurs to use their horns on each other, while
others might not think so. The children would then need to
critically evaluate the views and decide what they think is
morally defensible. In this case, science is not the only
source, and there is no predefined correct answer.
The Need to Make Value Judgments
Step 1: Practical epistemology analysis.In the two empirical
examples provided below, the need to make value judgments
is illustrated and solved in different ways. In the empirical
examples, we can observe a need to know which action is
valued as the right one.
In the first situation, the children hesitate about how to act
when they encounter a hedgehog in the preschool yard. The
children are playing in the courtyard on a warm and sunny
morning.8 Selma, Sofia, and Sara climb on two ropes tied
between two trees. Selma suddenly stops when she catches
sight of a hedgehog.
The girls start to examine the hedgehog and Selma notes
that the hedgehog is thorny. Sara suggests that they can poke
the hedgehog with a stick. All three girls each fetch a stick.
Selma then pokes the hedgehog with her stick. Sara says,
"We are just fiddling around." The girls hesitate--a gap
appears, in that they do not know if this action is okay to
perform or not. Sara changes her action by shouting, "don't,"
to Selma and runs toward a teacher. "Miss, Miss. There is a
hedgehog. Come and look. We have found a hedgehog."
Selma drops the stick and starts shouting, "We have found a
hedgehog. We have found a hedgehog."
The girls alert several children and a teacher, and one of
the girls, Selma, bends over the hedgehog and pokes it with
the stick. Kia, the teacher, however, informs the children that
it is wrong to poke the hedgehog with sticks: "No Sofia, do
not poke it. Let it be, you are not allowed to touch it," the
teacher responds. A possible gap arises because Selma says
that she is not poking, just touching. The teacher then clari-
fies that no touching is allowed: "What did I just say? You
are not allowed to touch it." Sofia runs to fetch more children
and at the same time shouts that they should not touch the
hedgehog. Selma shows in action that she has understood the
teacher by stopping the poking, and shouting to the other
children that they are not allowed touching the hedgehog.
Step 2: Comparison and potential consequences.The need to
make value judgments becomes relevant when the hedgehog
enters the preschool yard. The children find out that it is
wrong to examine the animal closely, at least by poking it
with sticks. Watching from a distance is considered to be the
right way to act. In this activity, the relevant way to act is
indicated by the teacher's prior value judgment of which
action is considered morally acceptable. There is no possibil-
ity for the children to discuss different ways to act in this
activity. The teacher's suggested actions are privileged, fol-
lowing the normative teaching principle.
In this situation, the fact-based teaching principle is not
relevant because the actions are focused on valuing behavior
rather than on handling facts.
For the actions to be consistent with the pluralistic teach-
ing tradition, the children would have to discuss whether
poking the hedgehog with a stick is morally defensible or not
and look at different ways of investigating the hedgehog. In
other words, they would need to study different views and
sources to critically evaluate the matter and solve the prob-
lem of how to act in this situation.
A Second Example of Making Value Judgments
Step 1: Practical epistemology analyses. A few children gather
together and sit in a ring on the floor.9 They have just sung a
6 SAGE Open
song about a mosquito, and a discussion about how to protect
themselves against mosquitoes has begun. The teacher, Saga,
leads the gathering and decides whose turn it is to speak. The
children have made different suggestions, and it is now
Svante's turn to contribute to the discussion: "But if a mos-
quito, if you feel that a mosquito lands on you, you just go
like this." He hits his arm with the palm of his hand.
A gap occurs as the discussion continues. Svante has pre-
sented the idea that you can smash the mosquito with your
hand, but teacher Kristina suggests another way of getting
rid of the mosquito--by sweeping it away. This statement
from the teacher indicates that it is possible to have different
views; Kristina's suggestion means that the mosquito stays
alive, while Svante would end up with a dead mosquito.
Kristina's suggestion can be understood as a grounded in
a specific moral value: It is wrong to kill insects. Svante
sticks to his idea and repeats his suggestion of smashing the
mosquito: "Yes, or smash it." The teacher Saga says that she
"actually" thinks that it is okay to hit mosquitoes because
they are not pleasant to humans. She develops this reasoning
by saying that it is okay to kill unpleasant animals, but those
that are not unpleasant should be allowed to live by being
swept away. Our interpretation is that when she says "actu-
ally," she indicates that there might be other beliefs about
this; this is just what she thinks.
Kalle supports teacher Saga's idea as he shows how this
can be done by smashing an imaginary insect with his hands.
The gap lingers because Saga says, "No, now you have to
listen."According to her, Kalle's suggestion of hitting insects
is not completely acceptable. Teacher Saga explains what
kinds of insect she thinks can be killed or not. Her reasoning
involves killing insects that inflict pain to humans; the other
ones can be swept away without them losing their lives.
Step 2: Comparison and potential consequences. In this exam-
ple, the teachers take different stands on how to act, which in
turn makes it possible for the children to also consider differ-
ent ways of acting. These kinds of actions are privileged in
the pluralistic teaching principle.
If both teachers had agreed on the same way of acting, it
might not have been necessary for the children to consider
different ways of acting. When the teachers decide for the
children which actions are considered to be right, the actions
are privileged and consistent with the normative teaching
principle. The teacher, Sara, argues that insects that inject
poison inflict pain on humans and then merit killing. This
also means that insects that do not inflict pain do not need to
die. If the other teacher, Kristina, had agreed with this, the
children would probably have felt obligated to agree as well,
and that would have then been regarded as the appropriate
way of acting in the situation.
Conclusion
The overall aim of this article has been to describe and ana-
lyze which actions are privileged in different preschool
settings and to compare these actions with those that are
privileged in three different teaching principles: the fact-
based teaching principle, the normative teaching principle,
and the pluralistic teaching principle. The comparisons are
made to be able to discuss what action competences children
are developing in relation to the action competences
described within ESD research.
We found three different categories of actions the children
perform to solve problematic situations they encounter. The
categorization of these actions is made in terms of "needs"
that are required to bridge different kinds of gaps: the need to
know what to focus on, the need for additional information,
and the need to make value judgments. Even if these actions
are not performed within a sustainability context, the chil-
dren develop general competences that are called for in ESD
research.
The privileged actions that are consistent with the fact-
based teaching principle involve, among other things, the
ability to make scientific investigations and to pay attention
to relevant sources of information. These actions were illus-
trated when the children played with dinosaurs. The teacher
helped the children to focus on something that they had not
focused on before. When the children needed additional
information, they found this information in a science book
for children. These two kinds of actions focus on handling
facts to be able to move forward in the situation.
A teacher's didactic choices may have a great impact on
the direction of an action (cf. Hedefalk, in press). If teachers
want children to develop competences that involve dealing
with moral problems and dilemmas, the use of facts is not
sufficient for moving forward in the situation. Actions that
are privileged within the normative teaching tradition are
those in accordance with predefined moral evaluations. Here,
children learn to follow someone else's directions. However,
if the aim is for children to act critically and think indepen-
dently, the pluralistic teaching principle asks for further
actions. According to this principle, to develop the relevant
acting skills, children need to experience actions where they
can critically value different alternatives. In the examples
provided, these actions became relevant when the children
discussed insects.
ESD researchers describe action competence as the ability
to discuss and critically evaluate alternatives (Læssøe, 2010;
Mogensen & Schnack, 2010; Öhman, 2011; Rudsberg &
Öhman, 2010). As there is not one clear way to solve sustain-
able issues, actors must be able to critically value what
actions can result in the articulated goal. Sustainable issues
are not articulated in the preschool activities we have ana-
lyzed, but students can learn how to critically discuss and
make value judgments about actions in more general terms in
some activities.
When the children were playing with the dinosaurs, we
noticed that the need to find facts was relevant and moral
questions were not. What seems to be important to focus on
in preschool activities, for children to develop action compe-
tences asked for within ESD research, is to learn how to
Hedefalk et al. 7
critically value different actions. In that sense, the fact-based
principle cannot be used solely to develop an action compe-
tence to make value judgments about moral dilemmas. We
do not suggest that teachers turn every activity into a moral
dilemma but we do want to highlight the importance of notic-
ing the activities where children can critically make a value
judgment.
The importance of being able to make a value judgment
was evident in the study when facts were not sufficient to
solve a problem. Without values, it is not possible to evaluate
what is at hand. Therefore, ESD has to contain activities
where children evaluate and critically discuss matters.
Learning facts is not always enough.
Hence, the study has shown that preschool teachers should
pay attention to situations in which value judgments become
important. When there is a need to make a value judgment
about a moral matter, there is also a possibility to create dif-
ferent solutions and critically evaluate what actions are
appropriate. By acting in these situations, children hopefully
can build the foundation of action competences discussed in
ESD research.
