Introduction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects about 13% of the
adult population and has already become a health care
problem worldwide. Further, numerous studies show that
a considerable proportion of CKD patients will eventually
develop end-stage renal disease or cardiovascular death,
highlighting the need for better prevention and manage-
ment for CKD.1,2 Interstitial fibrosis, characterized by
excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) pro-
teins in the tubulointerstitial compartment, is thought to
be the common final pathway of all forms of CKD, whose
leading cause is diabetic nephropathy.3,4 Therefore, it is
mandatory to develop rational strategies aiming at inter-
stitial fibrosis to combat the progression of CKD.

Abstract
Objective: The objective of this article is to investigate the renoprotecive effects of exendin-4 in a mouse model of
unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and explore the putative mechanisms.
Methods: Male Balbc mice underwent sham operation or UUO surgery, and then received intraperitoneal injection of
vehicle or exendin-4, respectively. After 14 days, mice were sacrificed and the left kidneys were collected and analyzed by
histology, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction,
radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results: As compared to the sham group, mice that underwent UUO surgery developed more severe tubular injury
and interstitial fibrosis, as well as higher expression of fibronectin (FN), collagen-1 (Col-1) and -smooth muscle actin
(-SMA). Also, we observed higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) while lower expression of
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), higher levels of intrarenal angiotensin II (Ang II) while lower levels of intrarenal
angiotensin-(1­7), and higher expression of transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-1) and phosphorylation of Smad3
(p-Smad3) in the obstructed kidneys. Impressively, these pathologic changes were significantly attenuated in the mice
group of UUO treated with exendin-4.
Conclusion: Our present study indicates for the first time that exendin-4 exerts renoprotective effects in an experimental
model of UUO, partly through regulating the balance of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system and then inhibiting the
Ang II-mediated TGF-1/Smad3 signaling pathway.

Although the exact mechanism of CKD is not yet fully
elucidated, accumulating evidence has pointed to the criti-
cal role of excessive activation of the intrarenal renin-
angiotensin system (RAS) in the pathogenesis of CKD.5­7
Among this fascinating system, angiotensin II (Ang II) is
the most powerful biologically active component and
considered to be a central mediator of interstitial
fibrosis.5,8,9 However, our recognition of the RAS has
become more convoluted since the discovery of a novel
enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
in 2000. It shares 42% homology with angiotensin-con-
verting enzyme (ACE) and mediates the degradation of
Ang II to angiotensin-(1­7) (Ang-(1­7)), acting in a coun-
terregulatory manner to ACE.6,7 Therefore, the balance
between the two enzymes affects the production and accu-
mulation of Ang II. Considerable research has observed
that the high expression of ACE as well as low expression
of ACE2 results in excessive accumulation of intrarenal
Ang II, which plays a detrimental role in kidney dis-
eases.10­12 Overall, the above findings support the idea
that restoring the balance between ACE and ACE2 and
hence decreasing the level of intrarenal Ang II may serve
as a target for CKD treatment.
Exendin-4, a glucagon-like protein-1 (GLP-1) analog,
was originally isolated from the venom of the Gila mon-
ster lizard (Heloderma suspectum).13 Nowadays, synthetic
exendin-4 has been widely used in the treatment of
patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, many studies
have indicated that exendin-4 exerts renoprotective effects
through various mechanisms in addition to the control of
glucose homeostasis.14­18 However, until now, it has been
unclear whether exendin-4 modified the activity of the
intrarenal RAS as part of the underlying mechanisms for
renoprotection.
Therefore, the present study was designed to explore
the possibility that exendin-4 attenuates interstitial fibrosis
by regulating the balance of the intrarenal RAS and then
inhibiting the Ang II-mediated transforming growth factor
1 (TGF-1)/Smad3 signaling pathway. We examined the
effect of exendin-4 on a mouse model of unilateral ureteral
obstruction (UUO), an excellent model to study the
pathogenesis of CKD without underlying hypertensive and
diabetic conditions.
Material and methods
Animals
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with
the guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Committee at the
Southern Medical University. Eight-week-old BALB/c mice
(weighing 20 to 25 g each) were randomly divided into four
groups, which consisted of a sham group (n = 6), a sham
treated with exendin-4 group (n = 6), a UUO group (n = 8)
and a UUO treated with exendin-4 group (n = 6). The UUO
model was established under intraperitoneal pentobarbital-
induced anesthesia. Then the left ureter was visualized via a
flank incision and ligated with 4-0 silk. The sham operation
was performed identically but without ureter ligation. Mice
received an intraperitoneal injection of either exendin-4
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at a dose of 36 ug/kg per day or vehi-
cle, respectively. After 14 days, mice were sacrificed and the
left kidneys were collected for further analysis.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)
Total RNA was obtained from renal cortex tissues using
TRIzol Reagent (Takara, Otsu, Japan) and then was used to
synthesize the complementary DNA(cDNA) using M-MLV
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA).
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on an ABI 7500
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA). The primers used are listed in Table 1.
Western blot
Western blot analysis was performed as described previ-
ously.19 Briefly, equal amounts of proteins were electro-
phoresed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electrotransferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Merck

milk or 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) dissolved in
Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) for one hour,
the membranes were incubated at 4°C with gentle shaking
overnight with each of the antibodies listed in Table 2.
Then the membranes were washed three times for 10 min-
utes with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxi-
dase-conjugated secondary antibodies (LI-COR, NE,
USA) for one hour. The bands were visualized with
Odyssey infrared scanning (LI-COR) and densitometry
was performed using Gel-Pro32 software.
Histological and immunohistochemical analysis
The kidney tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.
Samples were embedded in paraffin and then cut into
slices with a thickness of 4 um. Hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) (Leagene, Beijing, China) and Masson's trichrome
(Maixin, Fuzhou, China) stain kit were used to assess mor-
phological changes and degree of interstitial fibrosis,
respectively. Immunohistochemical staining was per-
formed to assess the renal tissue protein expression of
fibronectin (FN), collagen-1 (Col-1), -smooth muscle
actin (-SMA), ACE and ACE2 as previously described.19
All sections were observed under an Olympus B×40 pho-
tomicroscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Five randomly
selected cortical fields per mouse were assessed using
Image Pro-plus 6.0 software.
Radioimmunoassay (RIA)
Kidney amounts of Ang II were measured with an Iodine
[125I] Angiotensin II Radioimmunoassay kit (Beijing North
Institute of Biological Technology, Beijing, China) accord-
ing to the manufacturer's instructions.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
The concentration of Ang-(1­7) was determined using a
mouse Ang-(1­7) ELISA kit (CSB-E13763m; Cusabio
Biotech). Each sample contained the same amount of pro-
tein and the absorbance was read at 450 nm using an
EL×800 microplate reader (BioTek, VT, USA).
Statistical analysis
All results were presented as the mean ± standard devia-
tion (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
software version 19.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
The comparison of values between groups was measured
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by
a least-significant difference (LSD) or a Dunnett's T3
post hoc test. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Effect of exendin-4 on pathological changes of
the obstructed kidneys
As seen in Figure 1(a), H&E staining revealed normal
architecture of tubules in the sham group and severe
tubular injury in the UUO group. In contrast, exendin-4
treatment significantly reduced tubular injury of the
obstructed kidneys as compared to the UUO mice.
Masson's trichrome staining also showed that UUO mice
developed more interstitial fibrosis compared with the
sham group. However, interstitial fibrosis was signifi-
cantly attenuated by exendin-4 treatment compared with
UUO mice (Figure 1(b)).
Effect of exendin-4 on messenger RNA (mRNA)
expression of FN, Col-1 and -SMA
As shown in Figure 2, the obstructed kidneys in the UUO
group exhibited increased mRNA levels of FN, Col-1 and
-SMA as compared to the sham mice with or without
exendin-4 treatment (p < 0.01). However, exendin-4 treat-
ment significantly reduced the mRNA expression of FN
and -SMA (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). But no

significant difference in renal cortical mRNA expression
of Col-1 was observed between the UUO and UUO treated
with exendin-4 groups (p > 0.05).
Effect of exendin-4 on protein expression of
FN, Col-1 and -SMA
Insets of Figure 3 show the protein expression of FN,
Col-1 and -SMA. Immunohistochemical staining
results revealed that UUO caused a marked increase in
kidney cortical expression of FN, Col-1 and -SMA
compared with sham mice. In contrast, mice treated with
exendin-4 exhibited less ECM protein expression com-
pared with the obstructed kidneys (Figure 3(a) to (d)). In
accordance with the immunohistochemistry results,
studies by Western blot analyses further confirmed the
above results. The protein expression level of -SMA
was also reduced in the UUO treated with exendin-4
group compared with the UUO group, although the dif-
ference did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05)
(Figure 3(e) and (f)).
Effect of exendin-4 on mRNA expression of
ACE and ACE2
Next, we evaluated the effect of exendin-4 on mRNA
expression of ACE and ACE2. As shown in Figure 4, a
significantly increased concentration of ACE mRNA
was detected in the obstructed kidneys of UUO mice
compared with the control sham kidneys (p < 0.05).
Consistent with an increase in ACE mRNA level, the
mRNA expression level of ACE2 was reduced in the
obstructed kidneys, although this did not reach statistical
significance compared with the control sham kidneys
(p > 0.05). Notably, exendin-4 administration restored
the imbalance between ACE and ACE2 mRNA

Effect of exendin-4 on protein expression of
ACE and ACE2
We also investigated the effect of exendin-4 on protein
expression of ACE and ACE2 as shown in Figure 5.
Similarly, an imbalance between ACE and ACE2 protein
expression was also detected by immunohistochemistry
analyses in accordance with the real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) results. However, these changes were
significantly attenuated in the obstructed kidneys by
treatment with exendin-4 (Figure 5(a) to (c)). The results
of Western blot analyses were consistent with the above
findings (Figure 5(d) and (e)).
Effect of exendin-4 on intrarenal Ang II and
Ang-(1­7) levels
Intrarenal Ang II and Ang-(1­7) levels were measured
with the expectation that they would reflect the imbalance
in ACE and ACE2 expression observed in the kidneys.
Therefore, we explored the kidney levels of Ang II and
Ang-(1­7) and then evaluated the effect of exendin-4 on
intrarenal Ang II and Ang-(1­7) levels as shown in Figure
6. Compared with the control sham kidneys, significantly
higher levels of intrarenal Ang II and lower levels of Ang-
(1­7) (p < 0.01) were detected in obstructed kidneys of
UUO mice. Interestingly, treatment of UUO mice with
exendin-4 caused a significant reduction in intrarenal Ang
II levels compared with mice in the UUO group (p < 0.05),
whereas renal Ang-(1­7) levels were elevated in response
to exendin-4 treatment, although this increase did not
reach statistical significance (p > 0.05).
Effect of exendin-4 on TGF-1/Smad3 signaling
pathway in UUO mice kidneys
Subsequently, we explored whether enhanced interstitial
fibrosis in the UUO kidneys was associated with an upreg-
ulation of TGF-1 as well as the phosphorylation of Smad3
levels (p-Smad3) and whether exendin-4 could inhibit
p-Smad3 in UUO kidneys. As shown in Figure 7, both
mRNA and protein expression levels of TGF-1 were sig-
nificantly higher in obstructed kidneys than those in con-
trol mice (p < 0.05). Moreover, p- Smad3 in renal tissue
was significantly increased in UUO mice compared with
sham controls (p < 0.01). Treatment with exendin-4 sig-
nificantly inhibited TGF-1 as well as p-Smad3.
Discussion
Our data provide compelling evidence for the first time
that exendin-4 attenuates interstitial fibrosis partially by
regulating the balance between intrarenal ACE and ACE2
and then inhibiting the Ang II-mediated TGF-1/Smad3
signaling pathway.
UUO is the most-used animal model to represent the
main pathological feature of CKD. Concretely, it is char-
acterized by tubular cell injury, recruitment of interstitial
inflammatory cells, proliferation of interstitial fibroblasts
and increased deposition of ECM proteins. Among them,
tubular epithelial cells differentiate into myofibroblasts
in the obstructed kidneys and the activated interstitial
fibroblasts are responsible for the increased synthesis of
-SMA and ECM proteins.20,21 In our experiments, the
levels of -SMA and ECM proteins are effectively ele-
vated in obstructed kidneys. Furthermore, we have
observed severe tubular injury and remarkably increased
collagen deposition in the interstitium of obstructed kid-
neys detected by H&E and Masson's trichrome staining,
respectively, suggesting that we have successfully
induced the feature of interstitial fibrosis and created the
experimental model of CKD.
Accumulating evidence indicates that discordance of
ACE and ACE2 will lead to higher concentration of intra-
renal Ang II, contributing to the development of renal
injury. Ye et al. demonstrated that increased ACE with
decreased ACE2 was found in the kidney tissues of

diabetic mice, which fostered glomerular accumulation of
Ang II and contributed to the development of kidney
injury.10 Another study showed that the consumption of a
high-salt diet in rats significantly increased the glomerular
ACE/ACE2 ratio, leading to oxidative stress and renal
damage.11 An in vivo study also detected increased

intrarenal ACE and decreased ACE2 expression in patients
with type 2 diabetic nephropathy, which might contribute
to renal damage.12 Here, we have observed that the
decreased ACE2 as well as increased ACE at mRNA and
protein levels is found in the renal cortical tissues from
UUO mice. Additionally, this combination leads to exces-
sive intrarenal Ang II accumulation detected by RIA,
which may relate to the renal damage in UUO mice.
Ang II plays a pivotal role in renal fibrogenesis. It pro-
motes the growth of renal mesangial and tubular cells,
modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
increases the expression and synthesis of ECM proteins
depending on multiple fibrotic mediators such as TGF-
1, connective tissue growth factor, endothelin-1, matrix
metalloproteinase-2 and plasminogen activator inhibi-
tor-1. Among them, Ang II may foster renal fibrosis
mainly by interactions with TGF-1.5,9 In cultured
mesangial cells, Ang II could directly stimulate TGF-1
gene activation through protein kinase C (PKC)- and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent
pathways.22 Further, TGF-1 regulates kidney injury pri-
marily by Smad3. Deletion of Smad3 from mice amelio-
rated renal fibrosis in rodent models of obstructive
nephropathy.23 Additionally, the use of Smad3 inhibitor
to EMT and renal fibrosis in streptozotocin (STZ)-
induced diabetes provided a novel strategy to retard the
progression of kidney disease by targeting Smad3 signal-
ing.24 In our experiments, we find that significantly
higher levels of intrarenal Ang II as well as the expres-
sion of TGF-1 and p-Smad3 are detected in obstructed
kidneys of UUO mice compared with the control sham
kidneys, which is consistent with previous research.
Exendin-4 is a sound agent for use in the comprehen-
sive treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) by high-affinity GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in the
pancreas. The first study to explore the renoprotective
effects of exendin-4 was performed in 2007. It confirmed
that eight weeks of exendin-4 treatment inhibited
8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine excretion and decreased albu-
minuria in T2DM db/db mice.14 Then studies were under-
taken in STZ-induced T1DM models. Kodera et al.
reported that exendin-4 attenuated kidney injury through
anti-inflammatory actions without lowering blood glucose
levels.15 Mima et al. indicated that exendin-4 induced pro-
tective actions on the glomerular endothelial cells by
inhibiting Ang II signaling on c-Raf (Ser259).16 Ojima
et al. investigated the renoprotective effect of exendin-4 by
blocking the advanced glycation endproduct-receptor for
advanced glycation endproduct (AGE-RAGE)-mediated
asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) generation.17 Our
group performed an experiment in vitro revealing that
exendin-4 exerted an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation
and FN secretion in rat mesangial cells partly through 5'
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation.18
Consistent with previous reports, our study demonstrates
that exendin-4 effectively alleviates renal injury in a mouse
model of UUO nephropathy.
However, the mechanisms responsible for improved
renal injury after exendin-4 treatment are complex and not
fully understood. Interestingly, to date, there have been
many studies exploring the interactions between GLP-1
and the RAS. Skov et al. observed GLP-1 significantly
decreased circulating concentration of Ang II.25 Moreover,
it has previously been reported that GLP-1 effectively
ameliorates Ang II-induced hypertension as well as glo-
merular endothelial cell and mesangial cell damage.16,26­28
Based on all this research, we speculate that inhibition of
the intrarenal RAS may be involved in the mechanisms of
GLP-1-mediated renoprotection. Here, our study discov-
ers that exendin-4 is very effective in restoring the balance
of the intrarenal RAS in obstructed kidneys by decreasing
the expression of ACE and increasing the expression
of ACE2. Interestingly, treatment of UUO mice with
exendin-4 causes a significant reduction in intrarenal Ang
II levels and then inhibits the Ang II-mediated TGF-1/
Smad3 signaling pathway. To our knowledge, our study is
the first to report the ability of exendin-4 to alleviate inter-
stitial fibrosis resulting from UUO by regulating the bal-
ance between ACE and ACE2 and then inhibiting the Ang
II-mediated TGF-1/Smad3 signaling pathway.
In addition, another interesting finding of our study is
that lower levels of Ang-(1­7) are detected in obstructed
kidneys of UUO mice compared with the control sham
kidneys, and intrarenal Ang-(1­7) levels are elevated in
response to exendin-4 treatment, although this increase did
not reach statistical significance. To date, it has been
reported that Ang-(1­7) may have renoprotective proper-
ties.29,30 Whether Ang-(1­7) has influence on interstitial
fibrosis in UUO mice needs to be confirmed in future
research. Another limitation of the current study is that we
have demonstrated mechanisms described only in animal
models of UUO and are unable to provide direct evidence
of exendin-4 on the intrarenal RAS.
In conclusion, using the UUO as a model of CKD, for
the first time we demonstrate that the changes in the expres-
sion of ACE and ACE2 in obstructed kidneys, the altera-
tions in the levels of Ang II and Ang-(1­7), and the onset of
renal fibrosis can be reversed by exendin-4 administration.
We present a novel strategy to balance the activities of ACE
and ACE2, thus suppressing the activated Ang II-mediated
TGF-1/Smad3 signaling. Our results suggest that the intra-
renal RAS has become a more promising antifibrotic target
of GLP-1R agonists.
