Abstract
"Arbitrage CDOs" have recorded an explosive growth during the years before the outbreak of
the financial crisis. In the present paper we discuss potential sources of such arbitrage
opportunities, in particular arbitrage gains due to mispricing. For this purpose we examine the
risk profiles of Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) in some detail. The analyses reveal
significant differences in the risk profile between CDO tranches and corporate bonds, in
particular concerning the considerably increased sensitivity to systematic risks. This has far-
reaching consequences for risk management, pricing and regulatory capital requirements. A
simple analytical valuation model based on the CAPM and the single-factor Merton model is
used in order to keep the model framework simple. Then, the conditional expected loss curve
(EL profile) is studied in some detail. In the next step, the asset correlation associated with a
CDO tranche is estimated treating the structured instrument as a single-name credit
instrument (i.e., a loan equivalent). While tractable, the loan-equivalent approach requires
appropriate parameterization to achieve a reasonable approximation of the tranche´s risk
profile. We consider the tranche as a "virtual" borrower or bond for which a single-factor
model holds. Then, the correlation parameter is calculated via a non-linear optimization. This
"bond representation" allows to approximate the risk profile (expressed by the EL profile)
using a single-factor model and to express the dependence on the systematic risk factor via
the corresponding asset correlation. It turns out that the resulting asset correlation is many
times higher than that of straight bonds. Then, the Merton type valuation model for the
corresponding bond representations is applied for valuation of the CDO tranches. Using a
sample CDO portfolio, some opportunities for "CDO arbitrage" are described where it is
assumed that investors are guided solely by the tranches' rating and ignore the increased
systematic risk for pricing. In the next section we discuss how tranches with high systematic
risk can be generated and how CDO arrangers can exploit this to their advantage. It comes as
no surprise that precisely these types of structures featured in many of the CDOs issued prior
to the outbreak of the financial crisis.

Non-technical summary
Due to the information asymmetry between the originators of structured finance instruments
and the investors and the lack of reliable data on the collateral pools even sophisticated
investors with the necessary knowledge were not able to conduct an extensive valuation and
risk analysis of the structured instruments. So they treated them like corporate or sovereign
bonds and relied solely on the agencies' ratings. The use of the same rating scale for CDO
tranches and corporate bonds by the rating agencies obviously hid that there is a significantly
different risk profile also at the same credit rating with regard to the systematic risk.
Structured finance instruments appeared very attractive to investors as they could choose
between different risk/return profiles. Moreover, CDO tranches tended to offer more yield
than corporate bonds or loans with similar ratings.
Among CDOs, "arbitrage CDOs" in particular have recorded enormous growth. Arbitrage
CDOs attempt to produce a surplus from the collateral pool's acquired assets on the one hand,
and from the tranches sold to the investors after securitization on the other hand. In the
present paper we discuss potential CDO arbitrage opportunities due to mispricing. For this
purpose the risk profiles of CDO tranches are analysed in some detail. The analyses presented
here reveal significant risk profile differences between CDOs and corporate bonds which have
far-reaching consequences for risk management, pricing and regulatory capital requirements.
Particularly due to the increased sensitivity to systematic risks, CDOs become much riskier
investments than comparable corporate bonds. This results inter alia in rapid and drastic
rating downgrades once the underlying economic environment comes under stress. Another
major consequence stems from the price relevance of systematic risks. The considerably
increased systematic risk of CDO tranches needs to be compensated for by a significantly
higher spread than is usually paid for corporate bonds. If investors do not appreciate the
increased systematic risk, this offers arbitrage opportunities for the CDO issuers.
Coval/Jurek/Stafford (2009a, b) and Brennan/Hein/Poon (2009) analyse similar aspects of a
possible mispricing of CDO tranches. As in the present paper, the authors argue that investors
who solely rely on the rating generally pay a too high price for the CDO tranches. According
to Coval/Jurek/Stafford (2009a), this is especially true for senior tranches which default just
when the economy is in a very bad state. If a broad equity index is used as a proxy for the
market factor, option prices can be used. Using special options on the S&P 500 index with
comparable systematic risks, the authors show empirically that the highly rated tranches of the
CDX index exhibit market spreads that are significantly too low. By contrast, the results
obtained by Brennan/Hein/Poon (2009) indicate that the AAA-rated tranches are only
marginally mispriced, and that the highest profits can be gained with junior tranches.
In contrast to these papers we attempt to quantify the size of the CDOs' sensitivity to
systematic risks as precisely as possible, while keeping the model framework relatively
simple. For this, a single factor model is assumed for the collateral pool assets, and the loss
distribution is calculated. Then each of the expected tranche losses are analysed conditional
on the market factor realisations. It turns out that expected loss curve conditional on the
market factor (EL profile) is much steeper for unfavourable market factor values than for a
bond with a comparable rating or for the collateral pool. This expresses the greatly increased
sensitivity of the tranches to systematic risk. In the next step, the asset correlation associated
with a CDO tranche is estimated treating the structured instrument as a single-name credit
instrument (i.e., a loan equivalent). While tractable, the loan-equivalent approach requires
appropriate parameterization to achieve a reasonable approximation of the tranche´s risk
profile. We consider the tranche as a "virtual" borrower or bond for which a single-factor
model holds. Then, the correlation parameter is calculated via a non-linear optimization. This
"bond representation" allows to approximate the risk profile (expressed by the EL profile)
using a single-factor model and to express the dependence on the systematic risk factor via
the corresponding asset correlation. It turns out that the resulting asset correlation is many
times higher than that of ordinary bonds. In the next step a pricing model which depends
explicitly on the asset correlation as a measure of systematic risk is implemented for the CDO
tranches. CDO arbitrage opportunities are then described using a sample CDO portfolio. It is
assumed that investors are guided solely by the tranches' rating and ignore the increased
systematic risk. We subsequently show how tranches with high systematic risk can be
generated and describe how CDO arrangers can exploit this to their advantage. It comes as no
surprise that precisely these types of structures featured in many of the CDOs issued prior to
the outbreak of the financial crisis.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Die Informationsasymmetrie zwischen den Originatoren von komplexen strukturierten
Kreditprodukten wie CDOs und den Investoren wurde massiv verstärkt durch die mangelnde
Verfügbarkeit zeitnaher Daten zu den Collateral Pools. Auch für Investoren mit dem
notwendigen Knowhow war es nicht möglich, eine umfassende Bewertung und Risikoanalyse
der strukturierten Produkte vorzunehmen. Viele Investoren haben CDO-Tranchen wie
Corporate oder Sovereign Bonds betrachtet und sich vollständig auf die Ratings der Produkte
verlassen. Die Verwendung derselben Ratingskala für CDO-Tranchen und Corporate Bonds
durch die Ratingagenturen hat offensichtlich verschleiert, dass auch bei gleichem Rating ein
signifikant unterschiedliches Risikoprofil hinsichtlich des systematischen Risikos vorliegt. Da
die Investoren entsprechend ihrem Rendite-/Risikoprofil aus verschiedenen Tranchen
auswählen konnten und darüber hinaus die strukturierten Produkte anfänglich höhere Spreads
zahlten, erschienen sie sehr attraktiv.
Bei den CDOs haben insbesondere die ,,Arbitrage-CDOs" ein enormes Wachstum
verzeichnet. Arbitrage-CDOs versuchen einen Überschuss aus den erworbenen Assets des
Collateral Pools einerseits und den nach der Strukturierung an die Investoren verkauften
Tranchen andererseits zu erzielen. Für das Zustandekommen der CDO-Arbitrage gibt es in
der Literatur unterschiedliche Begründungen. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird untersucht, wie
durch Fehlbepreisungen Möglichkeiten zur CDO-Arbitrage entstehen. Hierzu werden die
Risikoprofile von CDO-Tranchen im Detail untersucht und potentielle Unterschiede zu
Corporate Bonds mit vergleichbaren Ratings genauer überprüft. Die vorgestellten Analysen
zeigen signifikante Differenzen im Risikoprofil zwischen CDOs und Corporate Bonds,
welche weitreichende Konsequenzen in Bezug auf Risikomanagement, Bepreisung und
regulatorische Eigenkapitalanforderungen haben. Dies betrifft vor allem die deutlich erhöhte
Sensitivität gegenüber systematischen Risiken. Dadurch werden CDOs zu wesentlich
riskanteren Investments als vergleichbare Corporate Bonds. Eine Konsequenz sind rapide und
drastische Ratingänderungen (Downgrades), wenn die ökonomischen Rahmenbedingungen
unter Stress geraten. Eine weitere wichtige Konsequenz, die für eine inadäquate Bepreisung
ausschlaggebend ist, ergibt sich aus der Preisrelevanz des systematischen Risikos. Das
deutlich erhöhte systematische Risiko der CDO-Tranchen muss durch einen signifikant
höheren Spread, als für Corporate Bonds gezahlt wird, kompensiert werden.
Ähnliche Aspekte einer möglichen Fehlbepreisung von CDO-Tranchen untersuchen Coval et
al. (2009a,b) und Brennan et al. (2009). Wie im vorliegenden Paper argumentieren die
Autoren, dass Investoren, die sich lediglich am Rating orientieren, in der Regel einen zu
hohen Preis für die CDO-Tranchen bezahlen. Gemäß Coval et al. (2009a) gilt dies im
besonderen Maße für die Senior-Tranchen, die gerade dann ausfallen, wenn sich die
Ökonomie in einem sehr schlechten Zustand befindet. Diese Zustände haben jedoch einen
hohen marginalen Nutzen und die zugehörigen Zustandspreise sollten gemäß der
Arrow/Debreu-Theorie hoch sein. Anhand spezieller Optionen auf einen Marktindex mit
vergleichbaren systematischen Risiken zeigen sie, dass die hoch gerateten Tranchen des CDX
Index signifikant zu niedrige Marktspreads aufweisen. Im Gegensatz dazu finden Brennan et
al. (2009) heraus, dass die AAA-Tranchen nur geringfügig fehlbepreist sind und dass die
höchsten Gewinne bei der Tranchierung mit den riskanteren Junior-Tranchen erzielt werden
können.
Im Unterschied zu den beiden Arbeiten wird im vorliegenden Beitrag versucht, die
Größenordnung der Sensitivität von CDOs gegenüber systematischen Risiken möglichst exakt
zu quantifizieren. Dabei soll der Modellrahmen möglichst einfach gehalten werden. Hierzu
wird für die Assets des Collateral Pools ein Ein-Faktor-Modell unterstellt und die
Verlustverteilung ermittelt. Dann werden die erwarteten Verluste der Tranchen jeweils
bedingt auf die Realisierungen des Marktfaktors analysiert. Die bedingte Expected-Loss-
Kurve (EL-Profil) wird mit Hilfe einer Simulation ermittelt. Im nächsten Schritt wird die
Assetkorrelation einer CDO-Tranche geschätzt. Dabei wird die Tranche als ,,fiktiver"
Schuldner bzw. Bond aufgefasst, für den approximativ ebenfalls ein Ein-Faktor-Modell gilt.
Die Approximation wird so vorgenommen, dass das simulierte EL-Profil möglichst gut
nachgestellt wird, und der Korrelationsparameter wird mit Hilfe einer nichtlinearen
Optimierung ermittelt. Durch die ,,Bond-Repräsentation" gelingt es, das Risikoprofil von
CDO-Tranchen mit Hilfe eines Ein-Faktor-Modells zu approximieren und die Abhängigkeit
vom systematischen Risikofaktor durch den entsprechenden Korrelationsparameter
auszudrücken. Die resultierende Assetkorrelation ist um ein Vielfaches höher als für
gewöhnliche Bonds. Dann wird für die CDO-Tranchen ein Preismodell implementiert. Hierzu
wird die risikoneutrale Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeit mit Hilfe des strukturellen
Firmenwertmodells ermittelt und in Abhängigkeit von der realen Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeit
und dem systematischen Risiko spezifiziert, wobei die Gültigkeit des (zeitstetigen) CAPM
unterstellt wird. Danach werden anhand eines Beispiel-CDOs Möglichkeiten zur ,,CDO-
Arbitrage" beschrieben, wenn sich die Investoren nur am Rating der Tranchen orientieren und
das erhöhte systematische Risiko außer Acht lassen. Schließlich wird im letzten Kapitel die
Konstruktion von Tranchen mit hohem systematischen Risiko dargestellt und beschrieben,
wie dies von den CDO-Arrangeuren zu ihren Gunsten ausgenützt werden kann. Es ist nicht
überraschend, dass gerade derartige Strukturen in vielen der in der Zeit vor Ausbruch der
Krise emittierten CDOs zu finden sind.

Systematic Risk of CDOs and CDO Arbitrage*
1 Introduction
The technique of securitisation allows to transfer a portfolio of illiquid assets or the default
risks associated with the assets to the structured credit markets using various credit transfer
instruments and to distribute much of the underlying credit risk to end-investors. This led to a
dramatic rise in the market for credit transfer instruments, especially Credit Default Swaps
(CDS) und Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs). For example, the volume of outstanding
CDS has increased more than tenfold over the past few years.
Among CDOs, "arbitrage CDOs" in particular have recorded enormous growth. Arbitrage
CDOs attempt to produce a surplus from the collateral pool's acquired assets on the one hand,
and from the tranches sold to the investors after securitization on the other hand. The Figure
below shows the issuance volumes between Q1 2004 and Q4 2008. The issuance volumes of
"Balance Sheet CDOs" are given for comparison.

Arbitrage
Balance Sheet

(source: SIFMA)
In the case of arbitrage CDOs, there is a sharp increase until the beginning of the financial
crisis from around US$23 billion in Q1 2004 to over US$155 billion in Q2 2007. A
correspondingly large volume of loans had to be granted in order to generate this high volume
of CDOs, with loans with higher yields (and greater risks) being preferred. This created a
huge leap in the demand for subprime loans. CDO trusts were constantly looking for BBB-
rated MBS (mortgage backed securities) bonds, which offered relatively high yields. The
CDO trust could finance their purchase by issuing highly rated CDO bonds (tranches) paying
lower yields. The business was so lucrative that there were insufficient MBS bonds in
circulation to form CDO collateral pools in 2006 and 2007. A solution was found with the
introduction of credit default swaps on asset-backed securities (ABS CDS). The result was a
large number of CDO collateral pools "topped up" with synthetic MBS bonds (MBS CDS).
This environment encouraged questionable practices by some lenders, and lead to a dramatic
fall in credit lending standards that was often described in the media.1

The valuation by rating agencies is crucial for complex structured finance instruments such as
CDOs. Due to their complexity, however, it is difficult to rate CDOs. The waterfall structures
and loss distributions are always different and have to be analysed and simulated on an
individual basis. Also, many collateral pools contain synthetic ABS CDS, which increases the
difficulty in rating these assets.
A further problem is the information asymmetry between the originators of the structured
finance instruments and the investors. Generally, data on the collateral pools are not available
on an individual basis, except for synthetic CDOs with corporate CDSs in the collateral pool.
As the database had not been disclosed, investors had no reliable basis upon which to quantify
the risks of these securities, and even investors with the necessary knowledge were not able to
conduct an extensive valuation and risk analysis of the structured instruments. They had to
almost completely rely on the agencies' ratings. Even though the regulatory authorities have
pointed out that the use of ratings does not excuse investors from conducting their own risk
analyses, many of them relied in practice purely on external ratings for valuing structured
credit products (see Bank of England, 2007). Many investors regarded CDO tranches like
corporate or sovereign bonds with the same rating and, in particular, also equated their risks
with those of bonds.
Structured finance instruments appeared very attractive to investors as they could choose
between different risk/return profiles. Moreover, CDO tranches tended to offer more yield
than corporate bonds or loans with similar ratings. This price advantage did not last, however.
Between 2005 and the beginning of the subprime crisis, rising investor confidence in the new
asset class led to a rising demand. Thus the spread differences narrowed and CDOs and
corporate bonds with comparable ratings were quoted at almost equal prices (see
Brennan/Hein/Poon, 2009, Figure 1).
In this paper, the risk profiles of CDO tranches are analysed in some detail and potential
differences to corporate bonds that have comparable ratings are examined more closely. The
analyses presented here reveal significant risk profile differences between CDOs and
corporate bonds which have far-reaching consequences for risk management, pricing and
regulatory capital requirements. Particularly due to the increased sensitivity to systematic
risks CDOs become much riskier investments than comparable corporate bonds. This results
inter alia in rapid and drastic rating downgrades once the underlying economic environment
comes under stress. Another major consequence stems from the price relevance of systematic
risks. The considerably increased systematic risk of CDO tranches needs to be compensated
for by a significantly higher spread than is usually paid for corporate bonds. If investors do
not appreciate the increased systematic risk, this offers arbitrage opportunities for the CDO
issuers.

Coval/Jurek/Stafford (2009a,b) and Brennan/Hein/Poon (2009) analyse similar aspects of a
possible mispricing of CDO tranches. As in the present paper, the authors argue that investors
who solely rely on the rating generally pay a too high price for the CDO tranches. According
to Coval/Jurek/Stafford (2009a), this is especially true for senior tranches which default just
when the economy is in a very bad state. These states have a high marginal utility, however,
and according to the Arrow-Debreu theory, the associated state prices should be high. If a
broad equity index is used as a proxy for the market factor, option prices can be used. When
the index does exhibit such unfavourable conditions, the "volatility skew" becomes important,
and investors should be entitled to an additional spread for bearing this risk. Using special
options on the S&P 500 index with comparable systematic risks, the authors show empirically
that the highly rated tranches of the CDX index exhibit market spreads that are significantly
too low. By contrast, Brennan/Hein/Poon (2009) find that the AAA-rated tranches are only
marginally mispriced, and that the highest profits can be gained with junior tranches.
In line with these two articles we also see limited risk assessment of CDO tranches prior to
the crisis. Market participants based their investment decisions on a tranche's rating grade and
otherwise assumed default behaviour like that of straight bonds, in particular concerning the
exposure to systematic risks. As a consequence non-equity CDO tranches were overvalued. In
contrast to these articles, our objective is not precisely quantify the degree of mispricing in the
CDO market. Instead we concentrate on an illustrative presentation of differences in the
default behaviour of corporate bonds and CDO tranches using a single-factor model
framework, which can be derived from a simple analytical valuation model based on the
CAPM and the Merton model. This allows developing a parsimonious pricing approach. As it
relates directly to the mentioned differences between bonds and CDO tranches and because of
its less complicated structure it sheds light on the consequences of possible misjudgements
concerning the risk properties of CDO tranches. By applying our valuation model on a sample
arbitrage CDO transaction, we conclude that there is no CDO arbitrage possible as long as
investors take the special default behaviour of CDO tranches into account. However, if
investors base their investment decisions solely on the ratings of the CDO tranches, this
creates a market environment that allows CDO arrangers to gain some kind of arbitrage profit.
In contrast to the above mentioned papers, here we attempt to quantify the size of the CDOs'
sensitivity to systematic risks. For this purpose we analyse the expected tranche loss of a
CDO tranche conditional on the market factor realisations (EL profile). In the next step, the
asset correlation associated with a CDO tranche is estimated treating the structured instrument
as a single-name credit instrument (i.e., a loan equivalent). While tractable, the loan-
equivalent approach requires appropriate parameterization to achieve a reasonable
approximation of the tranche´s risk profile. We consider the tranche as a "virtual" borrower or
5
bond for which a single-factor model holds. Then, the correlation parameter is estimated via
an approximation of the EL profile. This "bond representation" allows to approximate the risk
profile using a single-factor model and to express the dependence on the systematic risk factor
via the corresponding asset correlation. It turns out that the resulting asset correlation is many
times higher than that of ordinary bonds. Then, the CDO tranches are priced by applying the
valuation model to their corresponding bond representations. In the following section,
opportunities for "CDO arbitrage" are described using a sample CDO portfolio. It is assumed
that investors are guided solely by the tranches' rating and ignore the increased systematic
risk. We show how tranches with high systematic risk can be generated and describe how
CDO arrangers can exploit this to their advantage. It comes as no surprise that precisely these
types of structures featured in many of the CDOs issued prior to the outbreak of the financial
crisis.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a simple analytic valuation
model based on the CAPM and the single-factor Merton model of debt pricing. Section 3
discusses pooling and tranching and reallocating risks. First, rating-based risk measures are
presented. Then, the "bond representation" treating a CDO tranche as a single-name credit
instrument is described. Section 4 illustrates tranche valuation and CDO arbitrage. In section
5 is analysed how tranches with high systematic risk can be generated, and how CDO issuers
can exploit this to their advantage. A discussion and conclusion is given in section 6.
2 A framework for credit modelling and valuation
Collateral pools of structured finance transactions are typically composed of assets like e. g.
loans, bonds or CDS contracts. The risk properties of portfolio derivatives such as CDOs are
influenced by the default behaviour of the collateral pool's assets. Thus, modelling credit risk
of plain vanilla credit instruments forms the basis of modelling credit risk of structured
finance instruments. In addition, the valuation model for simple credit instruments, introduced
in this chapter, will be developed further to a model for evaluating structured credit products.
Asset-value-model
In this paper the borrowers' default behaviour is described by a parsimonious Vasicek style
one-factor-model which is derived from a Merton asset-value model. With the assumption of
a CAPM-conform asset pricing on capital markets, we are able to calculate risk-neutral
default probabilities within this model framework, which enables us to price credit risky
assets.

only when the firm's value at maturity T is smaller than the debt value. The liabilities

the nominal value of the zero-coupon bond.

The difference between real and risk neutral default probability represents a risk premium for
systematic risk. The magnitude of the risk premium follows the logic of the CAPM.
Systematic uncertainties concerning future cash-flows of an investment cannot be eliminated
through diversification, and thus represent risks, that have to be compensated by higher
returns of that investment.
The market factor
T
M determines via the asset-value process the conditional default
probability and therefore the conditional expected cash-flows to investors. The higher
i

higher the sensitivity of credit instruments to systematic risks and the higher the risk premium
asked by investors.

EL profile and valuation
A connection between the expected losses and therefore the expected cash-flows and the
realisation of the market factor

follows for the expected loss given the value of the market factor expressed as percentage of

We refer to this relationship in the following as the "EL profile" considering it as a function
of the realisations
T
m . It represents in our framework all systematic uncertainty concerning
future losses and thus contains all information relevant for pricing considerations.
Further uncertainty, i. e. uncertainty concerning the actual realisations of losses given a value
of
T
M , is of idiosyncratic nature and can be eliminated through diversification in a
sufficiently large portfolio and thus is not relevant for pricing.
Two credit products, showing identical EL-profiles, are exposed to identical systematic risks
and therefore should realise the same market price in the absence of arbitrage. This conclusion
will be the basis for the evaluation of structured credit products.

3 Tranching and reallocating risks
3.1 Tranching and rating-based risk measures
CDOs are securities which transform the credit risk of the underlying collateral pool into a set
of securities with different credit and loss profiles. Here we only consider a simplified
version, and do not take into account the waterfall describing the priority of payments which
is often quite complex. Instead we assume a strict subordination principle. If there are defaults
in the collateral, losses first impact the equity tranche (first-loss piece). If the number of
defaults is so great that the losses exceed the equity tranche's volume, the mezzanine tranches
incur losses and the mezzanine holders start to see a reduced coupon and principal. The
tranche with the highest subordination is the senior tranche. It only has to absorb losses if all
tranches with lower subordination are wiped out.
The loss distribution of the underlying collateral pool is crucial for determining each tranche's
risk profile. The collateral pool's loss on a percentage basis is an aggregation of individual
losses. Using

The loss distribution of a tranche relates to the loss distribution of the collateral pool.
Generally the tranche's status is determined by its upper and lower limits ­ its attachment and
detachment point.
Let us consider a tranche with attachment point %)

(a
b  . The tranche only suffers losses when the losses in the collateral pool until

remain below a, then the tranche does not sustain any losses. On the other hand, if the
accumulated losses exceed the detachment point b during the period, this results in a total loss
for the tranche.

denotes the "hitting probability" or PD of the tranche. It indicates the probability that the
tranche will be hit during the period, i.e. whether it will suffer any loss. It depends solely on
the subordination, i.e. the attachment point a, and not from the tranche "thickness" b ­ a.

- represent the "hitting probabilities" as a function of x . In special cases the
expected tranche loss can be approximated analytically or asymptotically, but generally it has
to be calculated based on simulation.
In general, the rating of a tranche is based on the hitting probability or the expected loss. If the
rating is based on the hitting probability, it represents a "first dollar of loss" rating and the
likelihood of an investor facing any loss at all until maturity is estimated. The "thickness" or
width b ­ a of the tranche is taken into consideration for a rating based on expected tranche
loss.
Other important risk measures include the variance or volatility of the tranche loss, the
tranche's unexpected loss, or value at risk and expected shortfall parameters. Generally these
measures can only be determined by simulation.
3.2 The systematic risk of CDO tranches
In this section the sensitivity of CDO tranches to systematic risks is studied in some detail.
This involves analysing the default behaviour of CDO tranches as a function of the market
factor M (for simplicity subscript T is omitted) and comparing it with that of the collateral
pool or a corporate bond with a comparable rating. To illustrate the differences, a sample
portfolio is considered for the collateral pool, and a sample CDO is generated. The collateral
pool loss, the tranche losses (see (15)), and the corresponding risk measures are calculated
using stochastic simulation.
13
Sample collateral pool and CDO
We consider the default behaviour and potential losses of a CDO with a maturity of five years
(T=5). A homogeneous portfolio of 100 equally weighted corporate bonds with a BBB rating
is used as the collateral pool. The empirical five-year S&P default rate of %
25
.

T
p is used
to estimate the unconditional probabilities of default. In addition, a homogeneous asset
correlation of 10
.
0

 and a constant recovery rate of 4
.
0
=
i
RR is assumed for all collateral
pool assets. The following tranching scheme with the associated attachment and detachment
points is used:
Tranche Attachment Point Detachment Point Hitting Probability
Senior 11.5% 100% 0.0014
Mezzanine 6.5% 11.5% 0.0316
Junior 4% 6.5% 0.1282
Equity 0 4% 0.8545
Table 1: Definition of CDO tranches
The hitting probabilities are calculated via simulation according to (14). If the tranche rating
is based on the hitting probability, the mezzanine tranche has roughly a BBB rating which
matches the rating of the bonds in the collateral pool. With a five-year hitting probability of
14 bp the senior tranche has a AAA rating.
Expected loss profile
To analyse the increased sensitivity of CDO tranches to systematic risk, we consider the EL-
profile, i.e. the expected tranche loss conditional on the realisation m of the market factor M
)
|
)
(
( m
T
L
E tr
as a function of m.
The slope of the EL profile for poor (i.e. negative) market factor values is a measure of
sensitivity to systematic risk.
First, the collateral pool itself is analysed. If the pool is regarded as an index or considered as
a single tranche, the homogeneous portfolio, based on the assumptions made and the single
factor model (6), gives us

.
However, this is exactly the same EL profile as for any bond contained in the collateral pool.
This means that, in absolute value, the collateral pool and the bond contain exactly the same
systematic risk. The diversification is expressed in the fact that the idiosyncratic risks are
reduced and therefore the share of systematic risk increases. In the case at hand of a
homogeneous portfolio, conditional on the market factor the losses are binomially distributed
and the variance of the conditional losses is reduced as the number of bonds in the pool
increases.
The situation changes dramatically if the loss distribution is split into several tranches and a
single tranche is analysed. For example, the mezzanine tranche of our sample CDO shows the
following EL profile (calculated via simulation):
Figure 2: EL profiles of the BBB mezzanine tranche and BBB bond
The EL profile for one of the collateral pool's bonds (BBB rated) is also shown for
comparison. Notice that the hitting probability of the mezzanine tranche approximately
matches the bonds default probability. This suggests that the tranche's rating based on the
hitting probability would also be BBB. Figure 2 graphically illustrates that the default
15
behaviour of CDO tranches and bonds differs drastically with regard to the influence of
systematic risk. Given unfavourable values for the systematic risk factor, the curve of the
tranche rises much more steeply than for a corporate bond with similar rating.
A consequence of the sharply increased systematic risk is rapid and drastic rating downgrades
in bad economic times. In a good macroeconomic environment (high values of M), the
tranche is hardly ever hit, while the corresponding conditional expected losses for the
collateral pool or for a single corporate bond are always slightly higher. In such a favourable
scenario, changes to the systematic risk factor have almost no effect on the hitting probability
or expected loss of the tranche, and CDO ratings appear very stable with regard to
macroeconomic changes. This impression is deceptive, however. If the systematic risk factor
comes under stress, CDOs (unlike corporate bonds) prove extremely sensitive to an economic
downturn. In this critical region, even a small change of the market factor causes a dramatic
deterioration in the tranche's credit quality. It is precisely this phenomenon that can be
observed in the US subprime crisis. Falling house prices and rising interest rates triggered a
downward spiral resulting from rising insolvencies, house sales and plummeting prices, and
the macroeconomic situation of the US housing market entered a critical phase. This led to
drastic downgrades of hundreds of CDO tranches which contained these loans in their
reference portfolios.
Another important consequence stems from the price relevance of systematic risk, which was
possibly not adequately appreciated by investors. The considerably increased systematic risk
of the tranches needs to be compensated for by a significantly higher spread compared with
corporate bond spreads. If the prices of CDO tranches and bonds are the same or do not differ
sufficiently, CDO issuers can exploit this to their advantage. This may provide a further
explanation for the emergence of "CDO arbitrage". The price-relevant aspects are discussed
in detail in section 4.
Loan equivalent "bond representation" for quantifying the systematic risk of a CDO tranche
The sensitivity of a borrower or bond, respectively, to systematic risk is expressed in the
single factor model by the correlation parameter  (assumed to be homogeneous). In this
section we estimate the asset correlation associated with a CDO tranche treating the structured
instrument as a single-name credit instrument. Thus we treat the CDO tranche as a "virtual"
borrower or bond, and approximate its default behaviour likewise using a single factor model.
Our aim is to estimate the "virtual" asset correlation tr
 of the CDO tranche.
Considering a CDO tranche as a virtual bond, the conditional hitting probability is expressed
in the single-factor model as a function of M by

The default threshold tr
c can be calculated using the unconditional hitting probability given
in (14). In this approach (see, for example, Yahalom/Levy/Kaplan, 2008) the loss given
default (LGD) of the tranche has to be specified in a separate model.
Here we introduce another approach. A key observation is that the LGD of a CDO tranche is
always a random variable that depends on the market factor. This is because the tranche loss
depends on the defaults in the collateral pool, and the defaults, in turn, depend on the market
factor. Note that this is usually not the case with a straight bond where default and LGD may
be independent. A CDO tranche's sensitivity to systematic risk can be increased further by the
dependence of tranche loss on the market factor. This additional systematic risk is contained
in the expected loss profile. Therefore we consider the EL profile as the tranche`s risk profile
and not the tranche's conditional hitting probability. Moreover, as outlined in the previous
section, the EL profile contains all the information necessary for pricing. The EL profile is
obtained via stochastic simulation. For the "bond representation", however, we assume a
constant LGD* for the tranche (instead of the random loss given default depending on the
market factor).

Thus 1

the non-senior tranches, the "implied" hitting probability profile of the "virtual"

 and LGD* as the loss given default. This "bond representation" is a more appropriate

the conditional hitting probability of the tranche.

From Table 2 it can be seen that in our approach tr
T
p is rather an artificial parameter for
fitting the EL profile than a hitting probability. tr
T
p corresponds to the unconditional expected
loss for the non-senior tranches of the sample transaction. The parameter tr
 can be
interpreted as the tranche's "virtual" asset correlation. It can be seen that the values of tr
 are
much higher than those for comparable corporate bonds (e.g. 1
.

 for the collateral pool's
assets) reflecting the drastically increased sensitivity of CDO tranches to systematic risks.

Impact of subordination
For the rating process of a structured finance transaction a tranche`s subordination plays a key
role. The higher the subordination the more losses in the collateral pool are absorbed by
tranches with lower seniority. Thus, higher seniority lowers the hitting probability and allows
higher rating grades. The EL profiles for the tranches are shown in Figure 4 below.
3 In the case of equity tranches and broad senior tranches, the bond approximation reveals somewhat larger
deviations from the EL profile of each CDO tranche. However, the approximation errors are negligible for the
issues discussed in the present article.
19
Figure 4: EL profiles of all tranches of the sample CDO
The position of the critical regions, in which the market factor has a strong effect on the
tranche`s losses (the EL profile has a steep slope), depends on the degree of subordination.
This area can be shifted towards the left side of the diagram (i.e. a scenario of economic
depression) by increasing the subordination. It is evident that the macroeconomic
environment must worsen greatly before a senior tranche is hit. However, if the critical area is
reached, the credit assessment of even highly rated tranches may suffer drastic downgrades as
we have seen in the current subprime crisis.
Investment in CDO tranches versus investment in the collateral pool
At this point the key difference between an investment in the collateral pool ("vertical"
tranching) and investment in a tranche ("horizontal" tranching) can be made clear. Let us
consider the sample collateral pool with an average BBB rating and the mezzanine tranche
(6.5 - 11.5%), which also has a BBB rating in accordance with its hitting probability. If the
transaction's total nominal amount is 1 billion Dollar, an investor can, for example, purchase
the mezzanine tranche for $50 million or he can invest this amount in a portfolio which is
comparable with or equivalent to the collateral pool. By construction, both investments have
the same implied PD. However, the two investments have significant differences regarding
their other risk characteristics. The main difference stems from the fact that, in the latter case,
the investment is made in the entire loss distribution of the pool, whereas in the case of a
tranche, the investment is made in a specific part of the loss distribution. The collateral pool's
20
risks are completely reallocated by the tranching process. On the one hand, a large senior
tranche is created which has a much smaller default risk than that of the collateral pool's
assets. On the other hand, the systematic risk (sensitivity to the market factor) of all tranches
rises massively. It is true that building a large collateral pool diversifies idiosyncratic risk, so
that only systematic risk remains. Such an investment in a well diversified pool is seen as an
advantage of CDO tranches. However, the systematic risk remains unchanged in absolute
terms in the collateral pool ( 1
.
0
=
 ; see Table 2), while, by contrast, the tranches' systematic
risk rises dramatically (e.g. 75
.
0
=
tr
 for junior and mezzanine tranches; see Table 2). For
this reason, a portfolio of BBB tranches from different securitisations (of the same type), for
example, is much riskier than a portfolio of comparable bonds or investments in different
collateral pools. In particular, the addition of CDO tranches to bond or loan portfolios raises
the probability of large portfolio losses, i.e. CDO tranches affect the tail of the loss
distribution. A consequence is considerably higher risk contributions measured by value at
risk or expected shortfall contributions, respectively.
4 Valuation of tranches and CDO arbitrage
The simple valuation model introduced in section 2 is used to identify potential possibilities
of mispricing of the securities generated by the tranching. We do not compare expliciltly
model and market spreads (see, for example, Coval/Jurek/Stafford, 2009a, and
Brennan/Hein/Poon, 2009). Instead we analyze which opportunities for CDO arbitrage are
available if investors ignore the tranches' systematic risk and base their pricing solely on the
rating in the form of hitting probability or expected losses.
The results presented in the preceding sections allow us to achieve the above mentioned
objective of an approximate tranche pricing with the following three steps:
(1) Starting point is the aggregation of all pricing relevant information and results in
generating the tranche's EL-profile (by simulation, see sections 2 and 3.2).
(2) The risk parameters of a "virtual" bond are calculated in a way, that the EL-profile of this
bond replicates the tranche's profile. We call this the "bond representation". (see section 3.2)
(3) This bond can be priced with equation (9) presented in section 2; sharing the same
sensitivity towards systematic risks, the tranche and the virtual bond are equally priced. As a
result, we arrive at the price for the tranche. Again, we assume a zero-coupon structure.
It can be seen from (9) that the bond price falls as the risk-neutral PD increases. In line with
(11), the risk-neutral PD increases ­ ceteris paribus ­ as the systematic risk rises. This means
21
that bonds with the same real PD

p should have very different prices depending on their
exposure to systematic risk.
Application to the sample CDO
In the following the present values of the tranches and the collateral pool are calculated using
the results from Table 2. This involves determining the risk-neutral PD using equation (11),
incorporating each of the "virtual" asset correlations of the bond representation. For the

a tranche (i.e. hitting probability or expected loss) at hand, but ignores the increased
sensitivity to systematic risks and instead assumes a "bond-typical" behaviour. The value of
the equity tranche is then calculated such that the sum-total matches the value of the collateral
pool. Table 4 shows the results:

Table 4: Tranche prices (based on an asset correlation of  = 0.1)
A comparison of the results in Tables 3 and 4 shows how a CDO arranger who retains the
equity tranche can exploit the situation to his advantage. If he succeeds in selling the non-
equity tranches in line with their rating (according to the real PD or expected losses) like
corporate bonds, investors will pay an excessive price and will receive inadequate spreads for
the tranches' systematic risk. For the equity tranche, by contrast, the situation is reversed. The
value in Table 4 shows that the price of the equity tranche as the "residual tranche" is
significantly too low. If the equity tranche spread is an "excess spread", this creates the
possibility to generate a positive net capital value from the overall transaction. Put another
way, the holders of the equity tranche charge a very high premium for the apparently high
risk.4
The results indicate that investors should receive much higher spreads for their investments in
CDOs as a risk premium than that which they are paid on comparable corporate bonds. This
was obviously not the case in the years prior to the start of the subprime crisis (see Brennan et
al, 2008). During this period there were virtually no differences between the prices of CDO
tranches and those of similarly rated corporate bonds. In some cases the spreads of corporate
bonds were even lower than the spreads of tranches with similar ratings.
In summary, there is a general way to CDO arbitrage when the non-equity tranches of a CDO
can be sold at the prices of corporate bonds with comparable ratings. In this case, it is
4
This underscores a remark by Tavakoli (2006), which points out that investors in equity tranches should never
accept an upfront payment and a fixed spread, which is usual with credit indices. Instead, they should always
demand the excess spread.
23
advantageous for the CDO arranger to put together the collateral pool in such a way that the
tranching creates securities with a very high systematic risk whose true prices should be close
to those of the respective cheapest-to-supply assets. This provides the maximum potential
profit for the arranger from the transaction.
In the next section we describe some possibilities of generating tranches with high systematic
risk. It comes as no surprise that precisely these types of transactions can be found in many
CDOs issued prior to the outbreak of the financial crisis.
5 Generating tranches with high systematic risk
5.1 Increasing the number of assets in the collateral pool
It is often claimed that a key advantage of investing in a CDO tranche is that it offers the
possibility to invest in an already well diversified portfolio. Additionally, if the systematic
risk of the portfolio is low, the unexpected loss decreases and realised losses are usually close
to expected loss. While this is basically correct, it is often forgotten that this applies only
when an investment is made in the entire collateral pool, in other words when just one single
tranche is formed. When tranches are created, however, a reallocation of risks occurs whereby
the systematic risk of each tranche increases drastically and is much higher than the
systematic risk in the collateral pool. This sensitivity to systematic risk is strengthened if the
number of assets in the collateral pool is increased. To illustrate this, let us consider the case
in which the number of assets in the homogeneous collateral pool is increased from 100 to
500, while the individual risk characteristics of the assets remain unchanged. A tranching
scheme is used which produces approximately the same ratings for the non-equity tranches as
the structure shown in Table 1 in line with their hitting probability. The results are shown in
Table 5.

Equity (0 - 3.5%) 49.809 0.4114 1
Collateral Pool 3.25 0.1 0.6
Table 6: Parameter estimations for the CDO tranches (n=500)
First it can be seen that the collateral pool's risk characteristics ­ as far as they are relevant for
the CDOs' risk analysis ­ have not changed. Although the relative share of idiosyncratic risk
has dropped due to further diversification, this is not price-relevant. In absolute terms
(expressed by the covariation with the market factor), the systematic risk is unchanged. The
price of the collateral pool thus also remains the same.
However, for the CDO tranches matters have changed. Apart from the equity tranche, all
tranches show a further increase in systematic risk. As described above, this strengthens the
CDO arbitrage. The following Table shows the tranche prices according to bond
approximation including the actual systematic risk, as well as the prices of comparable
corporate bonds )

Equity 23.309 7.339
Table 7: Tranche prices including the actual systematic risk, valued like comparable corporate bonds,
and cheapest-to-supply assets
It can be seen that the valuation of the non-equity tranches on the basis of corporate bonds
produces roughly the same prices as before because of the comparable ratings of the tranches.
However, taking the actual systematic risk into account, the prices ought to be distinctly lower
­ especially for the junior and mezzanine tranches ­ to compensate for the increased risk. On
the other hand, the equity tranche offers extremely high spreads and thus drastically higher
potential returns because of its very low price.
Finally it should be noted that a sufficiently large number of assets in the collateral pool
always produces tranches with high systematic risk. This also holds if the asset correlation
between the assets in the reference portfolio is very low, some of them may even be
uncorrelated. Thus the process of bundling a large number of assets with a low systematic risk
via securitisation with subsequent tranching generates securities with a very high systematic
risk. Among others, this applies to US residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS).
A further example illustrates the point. If an (extremely low) asset correlation of 0.01 is
assumed for the assets in the collateral pool (other risk parameters remain unchanged) and the
number of assets is increased to 2000 (which is the case with many ABS and RMBS), the
tranche from 3.5 to 5.75%, which now has approximately an A rating, has an estimated asset
correlation of 0.6.
5.2 Inclusion of assets with a high systematic risk in the collateral pool
Another way of generating tranches with a very high systematic risk is to include assets which
already have a high systematic risk in the collateral pool, while leaving the number of assets
26
at roughly 100 to 150. Examples are ABS CDOs (SF CDOs), in particular ABS CDOs with
subprime exposure, whose collateral pools contain RMBS mezzanine tranches, for instance.
These assets already have a high systematic risk, and second-layer securitisation further
significantly raises the systematic risk of the resulting tranches. The situation is similar for
many transactions of the CDO-squared type. The collateral pools of these structured finance
instruments are frequently composed of tranches which are in turn the product of
securitisations from the same or similar segments (eg car loans, credit card receivables,
leasing contracts), or include tranches of synthetic CDOs with overlapping names. In all these
cases, the tranches of the first-layer securitisations are already highly correlated. The second-
layer securitisation further increases the sensitivity of the resulting tranches to systematic risk.
Credit default swaps (CDSs) on ABS or MBS additionally increase sensitivity to systematic
risk. This was evident, in particular, on the market for MBS CDOs with subprime exposure. If
an underlying MBS tranche suffers a loss, this directly leads to a credit event for the
associated synthetic MBS CDS. Correlation is perfect in this case. This leveraging of real
MBS bonds multiplies the effect of the defaults on subprime loans and may result in an abrupt
loss of value if economic conditions deteriorate.
For synthetic CDOs, the credit risks in the collateral pool are transferred via credit default
swaps (CDSs). For these transactions, it is useful to look for CDSs that offer as high a spread
as possible for a given rating. This is the case where the underlying enterprises exhibit
additional risks, in particular systematic risks. For example, according to estimates (see
Bruyere, 2006, p 126), the collateral pools of the vast majority of synthetic arbitrage CDOs in
2002 and 2003 included the tobacco company Philip Morris. This was because the potential
risk of further legal sanctions against the tobacco industry was reflected in a high spread, but
the rating was unchanged at BBB. As the agency models only took into account the default
risk (in the form of the BBB rating) in their tranche rating, this offers additional opportunities
for CDO arbitrage for the issuers.
5.3 Creating as many tranchelets as possible
Finally, it is possible to slice the collateral portfolio up into a large number of very thin
tranches (tranchelets). These tranchelets are extremely sensitive to systematic risk. Thus it is
always advantageous for CDO issuers to generate as many tranches as possible in a
securitisation.
Similarly, virtually only tranches with a width of just a few percentage points were generated
in the construction of single-tranche CDO swaps. This also applies structured instruments
where several tranches were created but the capital structure was not completely placed with
27
investors. Where the tranches created in this manner are included in another securitisation's
collateral pool, the new tranches' sensitivity to the market factor is further raised. If investors
ignore the higher systematic risk in such a tranche and focus only on the rating, the seller can
exploit this to his advantage, as outlined above.
A particularly instructive example of splitting a tranche into two new tranches with the
possibility of CDO arbitrage is where a senior tranche is divided into a super-senior tranche
and a lower AAA tranche. This approach is customary for CDO structuring and is discussed
very critically, particularly in Tavakoli (2006).
By way of illustration, we will look at the capital structure shown in Table 5. The senior
tranche (10.25%-100%) has a hitting probability of 17 basis points (bp) (for a period of 5
years), which corresponds to an AAA rating. If it is assumed, for example, that LIBOR +
30bp is payable for an AAA-rated bond, investors would receive 30bp for almost 90% of the
total nominal amount for a synthetic (unfunded) CDO.
Now, a super-senior tranche is set up with an attachment point of 12.25%. This tranche has a
hitting probability of about 4 bp and is claimed "virtually without default risk" according to
the CDO arranger. It should therefore be possible (and this was generally the case) to insure
its risk with a monoliner at low cost of, say, 6 bp or, alternatively, to retain the risk on the
books. In this way, a saving of 24 bp is achieved for 87.75% of the total nominal amount.
The hitting probability for the next lower tranche of 10.25%-12.25% remains unchanged. If
the rating is based on the hitting probability, the tranche retains its AAA rating and therefore
also its price if investors focus only on the rating. However, the other risk characteristics have
changed dramatically, in particular in terms of expected loss and sensitivity to systematic risk.
As a consequence, the price, too, must change, and investors should demand a significantly
higher spread to compensate them for the higher risks. Table 8 shows the results of bond
representation and valuation.

6 Discussion and conclusion
In line with Brennan/Hein/Poon (2009) and Coval/Jurek/Stafford (2009a), this paper presents
mispricing of CDO tranches as an explanation for the exceptional growth of arbitrage CDOs
prior to the onset of the financial crisis. Although CDO tranches initially offered more yield
than cash assets (bonds or loans) with similar ratings, the spread differences, which declined
continuously from 2005 onwards, were far too low to compensate for the additional
systematic risk. Securitization of the collateral pool and tranching means risks are completely
reallocated. While the probability of default and expected loss of a large portion of the capital
structure are distinctly lower than for an average collateral pool asset, the systematic risk of
all tranches rises dramatically. If investors focus exclusively on the tranches' rating, they are
very likely to pay too high a price for the non-equity tranches. As the prices for the tranches,
which are weighted according to the capital structure, add up to the value of the collateral
pool, the fact that prices for the non-equity tranches are too high inevitably results in the price
for the equity tranche being too low.
The "bond representation" described in section 3 allows quantifying systematic risk treating a
CDO tranche as a single-name credit instrument. The tranche is considered as a "virtual"
borrower or bond for which a single-factor model holds. Then, the exposure to systematic risk
is measured by the asset correlation. In addition, we derive risk neutral default probabilities
using a simple valuation based on the CAPM and the single-factor Merton model. The risk
neutral default probabilities also depend explicitly on the asset correlation. This allows
pricing of CDO tranches as an explicit function of asset correlation. Thus we obtain different
prices for bonds and tranches with the same rating depending on their exposure to systematic
risk. The valuation of tranches and CDO arbitrage opportunities are discussed in section 4.
The desire to exploit CDO arbitrage opportunities usually entails the construction of tranches
with a high systematic risk. How this can be achieved was described in section 5. The
collateral pool's high degree of diversification was always regarded as a particular advantage
(see, for example, Amato and Remolona, 2003). In the authors' view, less collateral is needed
to cover unexpected default losses if pool diversification is high, thus raising "arbitrage
profits". However, in section 5 it is shown that increasing the number of assets in the
collateral pool leads to higher sensitivity to systematic risk of the tranches. Therefore, it is the
investors who should be entitled to the "arbitrage profits" to compensate them for the
tranches' much higher systematic risk. In addition, a large number of assets is not necessary if
the assets in the collateral pool already exhibit a high systematic risk. Prominent examples are
29
ABS CDOs, in particular MBS CDOs. The collateral pools of these CDO-squared instruments
include a large proportion (roughly 80%, see BCBS, 2008) of BBB-rated RMBS mezzanine
tranches. The RMBS tranches have a high hitting correlation. This means that the second-
layer tranches are much more sensitive to systematic risks. If the degree of hitting correlation
of the tranches in the collateral pool is underestimated, the second-layer capital structure is
such that the senior tranche with a very good rating is much too large. Another potential
danger for MBS CDOs with subprime exposure results from the relatively small width of the
mezzanine tranches in the collateral pool (2.5% to 4%) as well as the relatively low original
level of subordination (between 3% and 5%). Prepayments during the contract's life can
temporarily increase subordination, but overall it remains low. Rising default rates for
subprime loans combined with declining recovery rates may result in the BBB-rated
mezzanine tranches in the original RMBS suffering losses. The extreme correlation then
means a high likelihood that all BBB-rated tranches of subprime RMBS will be hit at the
same time. In addition, their small width means that there is a high likelihood that they will all
experience a total loss at the same time. This scenario means that the senior tranches of
subprime MBS CDOs will likewise default. These subprime CDOs therefore exhibit an "all or
nothing" risk profile5: either the subprime default rates remain below the thresholds and the
senior tranches of the subprime CDOs do not suffer any loss at all, or the thresholds are
breached, and the senior tranches could all be wiped out.
The opportunity to increase the value of the equity tranche by sophisticated tranching also
undermines the importance investors in senior tranches attach to the fact, that the arranger of a
transaction keeps the first-loss piece. Usually it is assumed, that this prevents the arranger
which is mostly also the designer of the collateral pool, from overinvesting and thus ensures
high collateral quality which also strengthens the position of senior tranche investors.
However, if the arranger can gain profit solely from tranching, these profits offset losses from
poor investment decisions, in other words, the credit quality of the collateral pool's assets
becomes less important as long as there are enough assets to form collateral pools. Thus, our
findings can to some extent explain the surge in demand for MBS bonds before the financial
crisis as well as the deteriorating credit quality in collateral pools.
Another aspect concerns the role of through-the-cycle ratings for structured credit
instruments. One of the key conclusions of this paper is that both the (conditional) hitting
probabilities and the expected loss profiles for CDO tranches are highly dependent on
systematic risks. The transition probabilities are similarly influenced by systematic risks.
When the economy is doing well, CDO ratings are very stable. They can, however, become
5 See also BCBS (2008), p. 6 and appendix C
30
very volatile in an economic downturn, and there may be significant rating downgrades within
a short space of time. This specific behaviour under stress makes a through-the-cycle rating
for CDOs as well as the use of average transition matrices, which take no account of the
current position in the credit cycle, questionable. In general, through-the-cycle ratings favour
CDO arbitrage opportunities, in particular during an economic downturn. Consider, for
instance, a synthetic CDO's collateral pool consisting of CDS. Then, the higher default risks
mean the CDS spreads are very likely to widen during an economic downturn. On the other
hand, the through-the-cycle ratings remain largely unchanged. If a new CDO is structured
with the same collateral pool, the resulting tranching scheme and the tranche prices are the
same if one focuses exclusively on the rating, while the originator's revenues from the
collateral pool have risen.
