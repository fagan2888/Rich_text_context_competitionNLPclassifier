OBJECTIVEdWhether nicotine leads to a persistent increase in blood glucose levels is not
clear. Our objective was to assess the relationship between cotinine, a nicotine metabolite, and
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c
), an index of recent glycemia.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdWe used cross-sectional data from the Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2008. We limited
our analysis to 17,287 adults without diabetes. We created three cotinine categories: ,0.05 ng/mL,
0.05­2.99 ng/mL, and $3 ng/mL.
RESULTSdUsing self-report, 25% of the sample were current smokers, 24% were former
smokers, and 51% were nonsmokers. Smokers had a higher mean HbA1c
(5.36% 6 0.01 SE)
compared with never smokers (5.31% 6 0.01) and former smokers (5.31% 6 0.01). In a similar
manner, mean HbA1c
was higher among participants with cotinine $3 ng/mL (5.35% 6 0.01)
and participants with cotinine 0.05­2.99 ng/mL (5.34% 6 0.01) compared with participants
with cotinine ,0.05 ng/mL (5.29% 6 0.01). In multivariable-adjusted analysis, we found that
both a cotinine $3 ng/mL and self-reported smoking were associated with higher HbA1c
com-
pared with a cotinine ,0.05 ng/mL or not smoking. People with a cotinine level $3 ng/mL had a
relative 5% increase in HbA1c
compared with people with a cotinine level ,0.05 ng/mL, and
smokers had a relative 7% increase in HbA1c
compared with never smokers.
CONCLUSIONSdOur study suggests that cotinine is associated with increased HbA1c
in a
representative sample of the U.S. population without diabetes.

Cigarette smoking and type 2 diabetes
are major public health burdens.
Both are risk factors for cardiovas-
cular disease and their co-occurrence
has a dramatic impact on the absolute
risk of mortality (1). Studies suggest that
cigarette smoking is associated with an
increased risk of developing type 2 diabe-
tes (2).
The effects of smoking on risk of di-
abetes are commonlyattributedto nicotine.
In the short term, nicotine is known to
cause elevations in blood glucose concen-
tration (3). Whether this effect is transient
or leads to persistent increase in blood glu-
cose level is not clear. Several studies have
shown that smoking is associated with in-
creased levels of glycated hemoglobin
(HbA1c
) (4­6), which is an objective index
of chronic glycemia, but this relationship
might be biased if smokers do not accu-
rately report their smoking status. A more
accurate assessment of the relationship be-
tween tobacco use and HbA1c
would be
obtained by using a biologic marker for
smoking, such as cotinine, the major prox-
imate metabolite of nicotine. Two studies
performed in populations with type 1 or
type 2 diabetes have used cotinine (7,8),
but to our knowledge, no study performed
among people without diabetes has assessed
systematically the relationship between
HbA1c
and a biologic marker of nicotine ex-
posure.
We used data from the National Health
andNutritionExaminationSurvey(NHANES)
to assess the relationship between cotinine
and HbA1c
among individuals with normal
glucose metabolism and among people
with impaired fasting glucose in subanaly-
sis. Our hypothesis was that nicotine (using
either blood cotinine or self-reported smok-
ing status asa measure of nicotine exposure)
is associated with higher HbA1c
in people
without diabetes and in people in a predi-
abetic state.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Study sample
We analyzed data from NHANES, a nation-
ally representative, cross-sectional survey
that became a continuous biannual survey
in 1999 (9). The continuous NHANES
uses a complex stratified, multistage,
cluster-sampling design to select a represen-
tative sample of the U.S. civilian noninsti-
tutionalized population. We combined
five successive waves (1999­2008) of the
continuous NHANES for our analysis,
producing a total sample of 51,623 people
(Fig. 1). Participants answered a house-
hold interview and most completed clini-
cal examinations in a mobile examination
center. We limited the analysis to people
who were both interviewed and exam-
ined, not pregnant, and $20 years old be-
cause the smoking questionnaire we used
was administered to adults aged 20 years
and older. We further excluded subjects

HbA1c
(n = 1,271), education (n = 44),
waist circumference (n = 1,290), diabetes
status (n = 13), smoking status (n = 32),
alcohol consumption (n = 1,967), or phys-
ical activity (n = 5). A total of 3,707 subjects
(14%) were excluded because of missing
values; compared with the nonexcluded
participants, they were more likely to be
female, black or Hispanic, smokers, and
have a lower level of education and were
less likely to be physically active. Excluded
participants had slightly higher mean
HbA1c
(5.6 vs. 5.5%, P = 0.001) and lower
waist circumference (95.2 vs. 97.1 cm,
P , 0.0001), but their mean age and co-
tinine levels were similar to the nonexclu-
ded participants. We limited our analyses
to people without diabetes, excluding an-
other 2,560 individuals. The NHANES
protocol was approved by a human sub-
jects review board, and informed consent
was obtained from all participants.
Smoking status
Smoking status was self-reported and was
collected during thehousehold interview of
adults aged 20 years and older. Participants
who reported smoking at least 100 ciga-
rettes in their entire life and smoking every
day or some days at the time of the in-
terview were classified as current smokers.
Participants who reported smoking at least
100 cigarettes in their entire life and re-
porting that they did not smoke at all at
the time of the interview were classified as
former smokers. Participants who reported
smoking fewer than 100 cigarettes during
their lifetime were defined as never smok-
ers. This smoking definition has been
widely used (10) and classifies participants
who have recently initiated smoking and
very light smokers as never smokers.
Cotinine
Cotinine is a major metabolite of nicotine
that is used as a marker for active smoking
and as an index of exposure to secondhand
smoke (11). Serum cotinine was measured
using an isotope dilution­high perfor-
mance liquid chromatography/atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization tandem mass
spectrometry (12). The detection limits
have changed over time in NHANES: in
1999­2000, it was 0.05 ng/mL; subse-
quently, it was lowered to 0.015 ng/mL.
For consistency, we used the higher detec-
tion limit (cotinine ,0.05 ng/mL). Partici-
pants below this threshold were classified as
unexposed for all surveys as done in previ-
ous studies (13). We created cotinine cate-
gories reflecting smoking exposures and
used the cut point of 3 ng/mL recently pro-
posed by Benowitz et al. (14) to distinguish
cigarette smokers and nonsmokers. We
chose to use this new cut point rather than
the older one (14 ng/mL) because it is more
sensitive and adapted to the current rela-
tively low level of secondhand smoke expo-
sure in the U.S. and it would pick up light or
nondaily smokers. Our three categories of
cotininelevelswere1)cotinine,0.05ng/mL,
2) cotinine 0.05­2.99 ng/mL, and 3) coti-
nine $3 ng/mL.
HbA1c
and fasting plasma glucose
HbA1c
was measured using a high perfor-
mance liquid chromatography system.
Fasting plasma glucose was measured in
participants who were examined in the
morning session after an 8- to 24-h fast (ap-
proximately half of the sample examined),
using hexokinase enzymatic method.
Diabetes
Diabetes was defined based onself-reported
data and fasting glucose. People were con-
sidered to have diabetes if they had been
told by a health professional that they had
diabetes, if they reported taking insulin or
diabetic pills to lower blood glucose, or if
theyhadafastingbloodglucose$126mg/dL

(15), whether or not they reported having
diabetes or being treated for diabetes.
NHANES does not differentiate between
type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but given the
fact that we limited our analyses to partic-
ipants without diabetes, it was not useful
to make a distinction between them. Indi-
viduals were defined as having impaired
fasting glucose if they had been told by a
health professional that they were border-
line for diabetes but did not take insulin or
diabetic pills or if they had a fasting blood
glucose $100 mg/dL and ,126 mg/dL.
The normal group consisted of participants
who did report not having diabetes and who
had a fasting blood glucose ,100 mg/dL.
Other covariates
Demographic variables and information on
alcohol consumption and physical activity
were collected during the household in-
terview. Race/ethnicity was categorized as
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Mexican American, other Hispanic, and
other race. Alcohol consumption was cate-
gorized as 0, #1, 2­3, 4­5, and $6 drinks
per week. For physical activity, we consid-
ered leisure time physical activity and cate-
gorized it in no or light, moderate, and
vigorous.Weightandheightweremeasured
using standardized techniques and equip-
ment during clinical examinations. BMI
was calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meter squared. Waist
circumference was measured at the upper-
most lateral border of the ilium.
Statistical analysis
For all analyses, we accounted for the
sampling design and used sample weights
that account for unequal probabilities of
selection and include adjustment for non-
coverage and nonresponse. In univariate
analysis, we calculated age-adjusted mean
HbA1c
according to cotinine and smoking
status. To adjust for age, we used the direct
methodtothe year2000census population
projections using the age-groups 20­29,
30­39, 40­49, 50­59, 60­69, and 70 years
and older. We built different linear regres-
sion models to assess the relationship be-
tween both cotinine and self-reported
smoking categories and HbA1c
, the contin-
uously distributed dependent variable. For
each cotinine/smoking measure, we built
two models. In the first model, we adjusted
for age only. In the second model, we ad-
justed for age, sex, education, race/ethnicity,
waist, alcohol consumption, and physical
activity. Additional to the demographic vari-
ables, we chose to adjust for waist because it
has been shown that smokers tend to have
higher abdominal fat compared with never
smokers (16) and abdominal fat is a good
predictor of insulin resistance and, hence,
higher HbA1c
(17). Moreover, it has been
shown that smokers tend to have higher al-
cohol consumption and less physical activ-
ity compared with never smokers (18).
Because these factors are also associated
with diabetes and insulin resistance, we
thought it was important to adjust for
them in our analyses. We performed test
for trend across categories of cotinine and
across categories of self-reported smoking.
These analyses were performed among par-
ticipants without diabetes or impaired fast-
ing glucose. In secondary analyses, we
replicated these analyses among people
with impaired fasting glucose. We also built
logistic regression models with cotinine/
smoking predicting high HbA1c
($90th
percentile). The cutoffs for high HbA1c
were 5.8 mg/dL for people without diabetes
or impaired fasting glucose and 6.1 mg/dL
for people with impaired fasting glucose.
Again, we ran age- and multivariable-
adjusted models. Finally, we explored if
there was effect modification by age or eth-
nicity and performed stratified analyses
for those two variables.
Statistical tests were two-sided and P ,
0.025 was considered statistically signifi-
cant, based on a Bonferroni correction for
multiple testing of two different smoking
exposure measures. We used SAS soft-
ware version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC) and SUDAAN software version 10.0
(RTI, Research Triangle Park, NC) for our
analysis.
RESULTSdAfter excluding people with
diabetes,thefinalsampleconsistedof17,287
peopled14,096 without diabetes or im-
paired fasting glucose and 3,191 with im-
paired fasting glucose (Fig. 1).
Using self-report to identify smoking
status, the sample included 4,073 smok-
ers (25%), 4,377 former smokers (24%),
and 8,837 never smokers (51%). Using
cotinine levels, the sample included 4,991
participants with cotinine levels $3 ng/mL
(30%), 4,946 participants with cotinine
levels between 0.05 and 2.99 ng/mL
(28%), and 7,350 participants with
cotinine levels ,0.05 ng/mL (42%).
The majority of participants who reported
themselves as smokers had cotinine levels
$3 ng/mL (96%). Only 3% had cotinine
levels between 0.05 and 2.9 ng/mL and
,1% had cotinine levels ,0.05 ng/mL.
However, among those who self-reported
themselves as nonsmokers (either never
smokers or former smokers), 9% had
cotinine levels $3 ng/mL and 36% had
cotinine levels between 0.05 and 2.9 ng/mL.
Characteristics of participants are
shown in Table 1. Self-reported smokers
and participants with a cotinine level $3
ng/mL were more likely to be younger,
male, have lower education, consume
more alcohol, and have low level of physi-
cal activity compared with self-reported
nonsmokers or participants with a coti-
nine level ,0.05 ng/mL.
Mean age-adjusted HbA1c
according
to cotinine and self-reported smoking sta-
tus are shown in Table 2. Among people
without diabetes or impaired fasting glu-
cose, mean age-adjusted HbA1c
was
slightly higher in participants with cotin-
ine $3 ng/mL and participants with
cotinine 0.05­2.99 ng/mL compared
with participants with cotinine ,0.05
ng/mL, with a significant trend across nic-
otine exposure categories suggesting a
dose-response phenomenon. When we
repeated the analysis among people with
impaired fasting glucose, we also found
that HbA1c
increased with nicotine expo-
sure, but the trend was not significant. We
did the same comparison according to
self-reported smoking status and found
similar results, with smokers having a
higher mean HbA1c
compared with never
smokers and former smokers.
Inthelinearregressionmodels(Table3),
we found that cotinine $3 ng/mL and
smoking were associated with higher
HbA1c
compared with cotinine ,0.05
ng/mL or not smoking. People with a
cotinine level $3 ng/mL had a 5% increase
in HbA1c
compared with people with a
cotinine level ,0.05 ng/mL, and smokers
had a 7% increase in HbA1c
compared
with never smokers in multivariable-
adjusted analyses. P for trend across cotin-
ine categories or self-reported smoking
categories was significant and suggested a
dose-response relationship. Subanalyses
among people with impaired fasting glu-
cose were similar. The stratified analyses
for sex and ethnicity suggested an effect
modification by sex (among males, smokers
had an 11% increase in HbA1c
compared
with never smokers) and ethnicity (among
non-Hispanic whites, smokers had an 8%
increase in HbA1c
compared with never
smokers).
In the logistic regression models,
among peoplewithout diabetesorimpaired
fasting glucose, we found in multivariable-
adjusted analyses that participants with
cotinine .3 ng/mL had 31% increased
odds of elevated HbA1c
(HbA1c
$5.8%)
compared with participants with cotinine

com-
pared with nonsmokers (Supplementary
Table 1).
CONCLUSIONSdInthecurrentstudy,
we used recent data representative of the
U.S. population to show that both cotinine
and self-reported smoking are associated
with an increase in HbA1c
in a population
without diabetes and in people with im-
paired fasting glucose. Our analysis
showed a relative increase in HbA1c
of
5% for people with cotinine levels $3
ng/mL compared with people with cotin-
ine levels ,0.05 ng/mL. This would
correspond to an absolute increase in
HbA1c
of 0.3%, for example, for someone
with an HbA1c
of 6.0%. Our findings sup-
port the hypothesis that smoking, and
more specifically nicotine, leads to a per-
sistent increase in blood glucose levels;
however, it does not prove causality be-
cause of its cross-sectional design. Studies
have shown that even a small increase in
HbA1c
concentrations has an impact on
cardiovascular disease risk and mortality
and that at a population level, an absolute
reduction of just 0.1% HbA1c
might re-
duce total mortality by 5­10% (19).
According to our data, 9% of people
who reported being nonsmokers (never
or former smokers) had cotinine levels
$3 ng/mL, and 36% had cotinine levels
between 0.05 and 2.9 ng/mL. This can
be a consequence of either inaccurate re-
porting, use of nicotine replacement ther-
apy, or exposure to secondhand smoke.
Self-reported smoking has been evaluated
as valid in NHANES in a study that took
into account use of nicotine replacement
therapy and exposure to secondhand
smoke (20). Therefore, in our analyses,

because ,0.2% of the nonsmokers used
nicotine replacement therapy, we can
consider the group with cotinine between
0.05 and 2.9 ng/mL as exposed to second-
hand smoke. In this group, we observed a
small increase in HbA1c
levels. Our find-
ings suggest that people with secondhand
smoke exposure should get adequate at-
tention because they might also have met-
abolic consequences as a result of their
passive smoke exposure.
The association we have found be-
tween self-reported smoking and HbA1c
is
consistent with other cross-sectional stud-
ies (4­6). None of these studies used a bio-
chemical marker such as cotinine to assess
smoking exposure. They were performed
in smaller samples, mainly in Europe, and
consisted of a predominantly white popu-
lation. Therefore, their results might not
necessarily have been generalized to a U.S.
multiethnic population.
The fact that cotinine is associated
with higher HbA1c
suggests that the rela-
tionship between smoking and HbA1c
is
at least partly related to effects of nicotine.
Indeed, studies have shown that nicotine
not only has a direct toxic effect on pan-
creatic b-cells (21) but also is associated
with increased insulin resistance (22).
Furthermore, the antiestrogenic effect of
nicotine could contribute to an increase in
visceral adipose tissue accumulation (23)
and via this mechanism, insulin resis-
tance. Finally, nicotine increases cortisol
level (24) and inflammation and has an
influence on adiponectin or peptides
that regulate food intake and body
weight, all of which could contribute to
higher HbA1c
.
Our study has several strengths. First,
we tested the relationship between smok-
ing and glycemia using biochemically
measured markers such as cotinine and
HbA1c
, rather than relying on self-reported
smokingashas been done inthe prior stud-
ies on this question. Second, it was conduc-
ted in a nationally representative sample;
therefore, results may be generalized to
the entire nondiabetic U.S. population.
Finally, we adjusted for many possible con-
founders of the relationship between smok-
ing and HbA1c
.
Our study has several limitations. No
inferences can bemade oncausality because
of the cross-sectional design of the study.
Even though we have adjusted for many
potential confounders, we cannot exclude
residual confounding or reverse causation.
Finally, the half-life of nicotine varies be-
tween and within individuals, and a single
measure of cotinine might not necessarily
reflect chronic nicotine exposure over
time.
In conclusion, our study suggests that
smoking is associated with an increase in
HbA1c
in a representative sample of the
U.S. population with normal glucose
metabolism as well as in people with im-
paired fasting glucose. The dose-response
phenomenon suggests that there might
be a linear relationship between cotinine
and HbA1c
. These results support, but do
not prove, the hypothesis that smoking,
and more specifically nicotine, leads to a
persistent increase in blood glucose levels.
