OBJECTIVE -- The lack of a universally applicable model for the metabolic syndrome in the
pediatric population makes it difficult to define this syndrome and compare its prevalence across
studies and diverse populations. We sought to assess whether a single underlying factor could
represent the metabolic syndrome in adolescents.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Using data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (1999­2002), we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis to
assess the validity of waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and systolic blood pres-
sure (SBP) as potential phenotypic traits for the metabolic syndrome in adolescents aged 12­17
years (n  1,262). A multiple-group approach was used to test the invariance in factor loadings
across sex and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS -- The estimates of factor loadings for the total sample were 0.76, 0.46, 0.81, and
0.42 for waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and SBP, respectively. The goodness-
of-fit indexes were adequate for the total sample (comparative fit index, 0.99; standardized root
mean square residual, 0.02), Caucasian boys (1.0; 0.01), African-American boys (0.99; 0.03),
Mexican-American boys (1.0; 0.01), Mexican-American girls (1.0; 0.01), and Caucasian girls
(0.95; 0.04) and acceptable for African-American girls (0.94; 0.05). There were no significant
differences in factor loadings of the four measured variables between boys and girls and among
the three racial or ethnic subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS -- The metabolic syndrome as a single underlying factor for the four simple
phenotypic traits may be plausible in adolescents. The proposed model appears to be general-
izable across sex and race/ethnicity.

Metabolic syndrome is a clustering
of metabolic risk factors including
abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia,
glucose intolerance, and elevated blood
pressure, and it has become a health chal-
lenge in children and adolescents (1). Us-
ing a modification of the definition
proposed by the National Cholesterol Ed-
ucation Program Expert Panel on Detec-
tion, Evaluation, and Treatment of High
Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treat-
ment Panel III) (2), the prevalence of the
metabolic syndrome was 4% during
1988­1994 and increased to 6.4% dur-
ing 1999­2000 (3) among adolescents in
the U.S. The prevalence was 30%
among U.S. overweight adolescents (4).
About a dozen studies have used ex-
ploratory factor analysis to examine the
relationships of traditional and emerging
risk factors considering the potential phe-
notypic traits or components of the met-
abolic syndrome in children and
adolescents (5­15). The number of com-
ponents ranged from 5 to 26, and the
number of factors identified ranged from
1 to 7. The most frequently examined
measurements included one or more an-
thropometric measures, blood pressure,
and concentrations of triglycerides, HDL
cholesterol, and fasting insulin. No con-
sensus on the type and number of com-
ponents for the metabolic syndrome has
been reached thus far.
Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
has been used to evaluate the models with
four factors (16­18), a second-order fac-
tor (16), and one factor (19) in adults.
Using waist circumference or waist-to-hip
ratio, BMI, fasting insulin or insulin sen-
sitivity, fasting glucose, triglycerides,
HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure
(SBP), and diastolic blood pressure
(DBP), the four-factor model appeared to
be supported among Europeans, African
Americans, and Hispanics (16­18) and
provided insights in understanding the
interrelationships among the measured
variables. However, it did not directly ad-
dress the nature of the metabolic syn-
drome as a single underlying factor. Using
waist circumference, triglycerides­to­HDL
cholesterol ratio, homeostasis model as-
sessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR),
and mean arterial pressure (MAP), a sin-
gle-factor model of the metabolic syn-
drome was identified in adults (19). This
model greatly simplified the modeling
process, yet calculating the three secondary
variables still required six direct measures.
Lack of a universally acceptable and
applicable model for the metabolic syn-
drome in the pediatric population makes
it difficult to define this syndrome and
compare its prevalence across studies and
diverse populations. Using clinically
available measures and a conceptually
simple model may be a practical way to
define the metabolic syndrome and may
spur physicians to diagnose the syndrome
among their patients. Fasting insulin was
highly correlated with HOMA-IR (r 
0.95) (20), and adding fasting glucose to

fasting insulin appeared to provide little
improvement in relation to insulin resis-
tance in both adults (21) and children
(22). Elevated triglycerides have been
considered a key marker for atherogenic
dyslipidemia (23). In addition, SBP was
related to fasting insulin and body com-
position measures, whereas DBP was not
or was weakly related to these measures in
children and adolescents (24).
Thus, we proposed a new model us-
ing four simple and directly measured
variables--waist circumference, triglyc-
erides, fasting insulin, and SBP--as the
potential phenotypic traits of the meta-
bolic syndrome in adolescents. The goals
of this study were to examine the con-
struct validity and goodness of fit of the
one-factor model proposed in adolescents
and to test the invariance in factor load-
ings across sex and race/ethnicity.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The 1999 ­2002 Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey used a multistage, stratified sam-
pling design to represent the noninstitu-
tionalized civilian U.S. population
(25,26). Participants were interviewed at
home and were invited to attend a mobile
examination center where they provided
a blood sample and were examined. We
limited the analyses to boys and girls aged
12­17 years who attended the morning
medical examination, had fasted 8 h,
and had complete data on all variables
(n  1,262). Only non-Hispanic Cauca-
sians, non-Hispanic African Americans,
and Mexican Americans were included in
the final analyses.
Serum specimens were frozen at
70°C, shipped on dry ice, and stored
at 70°C until analysis. Plasma insulin
concentration was measured via a Phar-
macia insulin radioimmunoassay kit
(Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Swe-
den). Plasma glucose concentration was
measured by using an enzymatic reaction
(Cobas Mira Chemistry System; Roche
Diagnostic Systems, Montclair, NJ). De-
tails on insulin assays can be found else-
where (25­27). The HOMA-IR was
calculated as [glucose (mmol/l)  insulin
(U/ml)]/22.5 (28). Triglyceride concen-
tration level was measured enzymatically
in serum after being hydrolyzed to glyc-
erol using a series of coupled reactions.
HDL cholesterol level was directly mea-
sured on a Hitachi 704 Analyzer after the
precipitation of other lipoproteins with a
heparin-manganese chloride mixture.
The triglycerides­to­HDL cholesterol
level was calculated using triglyceride
concentration divided by HDL choles-
terol concentration.
Waist circumference was measured
by two trained health technicians using a
steel measuring tape to the nearest 0.1 cm
at the high point of the iliac crest at min-
imal respiration when the participant was
in a standing position (29). Up to four SBP
and DBP readings were obtained from
participants. The average of the last two
measurements of SBP and DBP for the
participants who had three or four mea-
surements, the last measurement for the
participants with only two measure-
ments, and the only measurement for the
participants who had one measurement
were used to establish high blood pres-
sure status. MAP was calculated as DBP 
1/3(SBP  DBP).
Statistical analysis
Fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycerides,
and triglycerides­to­HDL cholesterol
were log transformed to approximate a
normal distribution. All variables were
standardized (mean  0 and SD  1) for
age and sex. The four-factor model and
the one-factor CFA model in adults were
specified according to Shen et al. (16) and
Pladevall et al. (19). The one-factor model
proposed in adolescents was specified as
follows: waist circumference, triglycer-
ides, fating insulin, and SBP may be influ-
enced by an underlying factor, the
"metabolic syndrome," and a measure-
ment error. No correlated measurement
errors between any two measures were as-
sumed. The factor loading () of each
measured variable indicates the strength
of its association with the underlying fac-
tor. We used a cutoff value of 0.3 as the
minimal level of a practically significant
factor loading (30) and   0.05 as the sig-
nificance level for two-tailed statistical tests.
The estimates of the parameters were
obtained using the maximum likelihood
method of the Mplus software (31). The
2 test, comparative fit index (CFI), and
standardized root mean square residual
were used to assess the goodness of fit of
the hypothesized model to the data
(30,31). A cutoff value between 0.90 and
0.95 for CFI is recommended as an ac-
ceptable fit (32), and a cutoff value of
0.95 for CFI or 0.08 for standardized
root mean square residual is recom-
mended for a good fit (32).
A multiple-group analysis was con-
ducted to test the invariance of factor
loadings in the CFA model across sex and
race/ethnicity. The 2 difference test was
used to determine whether the factor
loadings between the two groups were
statistically significant. The Bonferroni
adjustments of the P values were applied
for the comparisons of overall factor load-
ings among the three racial or ethnic sub-
groups (0.05/3  0.017), the four
individual factor loadings (0.05/4 
0.013) by sex, and the six pairs of factor
loadings (0.05/6  0.008) of the final
model for the total sample.
RESULTS -- In the final analytic sam-
ple, 51.2% were boys, 29.4% Caucasians,
30.7% African Americans, and 39.9%
Mexican Americans. The means  SD and
correlation coefficients of waist circum-
ference, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and
SBP are shown in Table 1.
The four-factor model proposed by
Shen et al. (16) was carefully specified, yet
resulted in no convergence. The correla-
tion coefficients of DBP (ranged from 0.02
to 0.10) or fasting glucose (0.04 to 0.22)
with other components were low. The es-
timates of goodness of fit for the one-
factor CFA model proposed in adults by
Pladevall et al. (19) were adequate (Fig.
1A). However, the factor loading for MAP
was low (  0.12), indicating a poor
validity of this measure.
The estimates of goodness of fit for
the one-factor CFA model proposed in
the present study were adequate (Fig. 1B).
The overall estimates of factor loadings for
the total sample were 0.76, 0.46, 0.81,
and 0.42 for waist circumference, triglyc-
erides, fasting insulin, and SBP, respec-
tively. All estimates of factor loadings
were0.3,indicatinganacceptablevalidity
of the four directly measured variables.
The forthcoming analyses were based
on the one-factor model in adolescents
proposed in the present study. The esti-
mates of goodness-of-fit indexes were ex-
cellent for Caucasian (Fig. 2A), African-
American (Fig. 2C), and Mexican-
American (Fig. 2E) boys and Mexican-
American girls (Fig. 2F); good for
Caucasian girls (Fig. 2B); and acceptable
for African-American girls (Fig. 2D).
Among the four measures, fasting insulin
had the largest factor loading for the met-
abolic syndrome in all sex- and race/
ethnicity-specific subgroups, except in
African-American girls.
The estimates of factor loadings of the
four measures for the metabolic syn-
drome were similar between boys and
girls (2  4.88 [3 d.f.], P  0.18). There
was no statistical significance in the esti-
mates of factor loadings between boys and

d.f.], P  0.10), African Americans (2 
0.73 [3 d.f.], P  0.87), and Mexican
Americans (2  3.21 [3 d.f.], P  0.36),
suggesting similarity in the construct va-
lidity of the measured variables for the
metabolic syndrome across sex. No statis-
tically significant differences in the overall
factor loadings among the three racial/
ethic subgroups were detected using Bon-
ferroni adjustments for P values at the
0.017 level (Table 2).
There were no statistically significant
differences in the estimates of factor load-
ings between waist circumference and
fasting insulin (2  0.06 [1 d.f.], P 
0.81) and between triglycerides and SBP
(2  0.77 [1 d.f.], P  0.38). The factor
loading of waist circumference was greater
than that of triglycerides (2  59.78 [1
d.f.], P  0.01) and SBP (2  77.43 [1
d.f.], P  0.01). The factor loading of fast-
ing insulin was greater than that of trig-
lycerides (2  79.14 [1 d.f.], P  0.01)
and SBP (2  89.37 [1 d.f.], P  0.01).
HDL cholesterol was inversely corre-
lated with triglycerides (r  0.42). The
correlation between triglycerides and
triglycerides­to­HDL cholesterol ratio
(r  0.93) was stronger than that between
HDL cholesterol and triglycerides­to­
HDL cholesterol (r  0.69). The factor
loading of triglycerides (  0.46) was
similar to triglycerides­to­HDL choles-
terol ratio (  0.50), but slightly larger
than that of HDL cholesterol ( 
0.38). Multiple group analyses indi-
cated that the factor structure of the
model using HDL cholesterol differed be-
tween African Americans and Mexican
Americans (2  10.82 [3 d.f.], P 
0.0127). In addition, the factor loading of
fasting insulin (  0.81) was similar to
that of HOMA-IR (  0.78) but larger
than that of fasting glucose (  0.17).
CONCLUSIONS -- Based on the ad-
equate fit and valid factor structures of the
one-factor model proposed in the present
study, waist circumference, triglycerides,
fasting insulin, and SBP may be poten-
tially useful as the four phenotypic traits
of an underlying factor that defines the
metabolic syndrome in adolescents. Of

The metabolic syndrome in adolescents

measures, waist circumference and fast-
ing insulin appeared to be the major com-
ponents in the syndrome. In particular,
the one-factor model seemed to be gener-
alizable in various subpopulations be-
cause no significant differences in the
factor structures of the model across sex
and race/ethnicity were detected in our
study.
Despite an overall adequate fit for the
model proposed by Pladevall et al. (19) in
adults, MAP as a potential component for
the metabolic syndrome in adolescents
may be questionable because of its poor
construct validity (  0.12). In fact,
MAP, as a measure of average pressure
throughout the cardiac cycle, has been
studied less in relation to insulin resis-
tance or obesity among both children and
adults. In contrast, SBP was positively as-
sociated with insulin resistance, whereas
DBP was not or was weakly associated
with insulin resistance (24). Thus, the use
of SBP as a potential component for the
metabolic syndrome seemed to be more
tenable than either MAP or a combination
of SBP and DBP in adolescents.
There are several advantages of using
fasting insulin as a potential component
for the metabolic syndrome. At the sim-
plest level, it is as good a surrogate esti-
mate of insulin resistance (20­22) as
various combinations of fasting insulin
and glucose concentration such as
HOMA-IR (28). Of greater clinical rele-
vance may be the pathophysiological role
that hyperinsulinemia plays in the devel-
opment of the clinical abnormalities that
occur more frequently in individuals who
are insulin resistant. Finally, the construct
validity of fasting insulin was similar to
that of HOMA-IR, yet much greater than
that of fasting glucose in the definition of
the metabolic syndrome.
The use of triglycerides in lieu of a
triglycerides­to­HDL ratio or HDL cho-
lesterol as a possible component of the
metabolic syndrome in adolescents may
have the following advantages: 1) triglyc-
erides correlated more closely to triglyc-
erides­to­HDL cholesterol ratio than
HDL cholesterol; 2) the model using trig-
lycerides was less variant in factor struc-
tures than that using HDL cholesterol
across sex and race/ethnicity; 3) elevated
triglyceride concentrations have been
considered a key marker for atherogenic
dyslipidemia or the lipid triad, i.e., raised
triglyceride levels, small LDL particles,
and low HDL cholesterol (23); and 4) low
HDL cholesterol was a component of the
metabolic syndrome only in the presence
of hypertriglyceridemia in patients with
type 2 diabetes (33). Therefore, triglycer-
ides appeared to be a preferable measure
of dyslipidemia in the definition of the
metabolic syndrome in adolescents.
Insulin resistance and abdominal
obesity have been proposed as major un-
derlying causes for the metabolic syn-
drome (34,35). Direct comparison of the
relative importance of insulin resistance
and abdominal obesity in the metabolic
syndrome is difficult and scarce in litera-
ture. A previous study (15) showed that
obesity might be a stronger component of
the metabolic syndrome in adolescents
than hyperinsulinemia. Our results, how-
ever, that fasting insulin and waist cir-
cumference were approximately equally
associated with the metabolic syndrome,
suggest that both insulin resistance and
abdominal obesity may be the key fea-
tures of the syndrome.
Our results provide a conceptual
framework of the metabolic syndrome in
adolescents. To be useful in clinical prac-
tice, research, and surveillance, findings
from factor analyses have to be translated
into a practical definition of the metabolic

syndrome. One approach would be to
emulate the definitions of the metabolic
syndrome among adults, such as the ones
developed by the National Cholesterol
Education Program and the World Health
Organization, and use threshold values
for the components specific to children
and adolescents, as recommended in
guidelines for waist circumference
(4,36,37) and SBP (38). Adult thresholds
for triglycerides would need to be adapted
to children and adolescents (2). The
threshold value of 20 mU/l for fasting
plasma insulin concentration proposed
by the American Heart Association may
be potentially useful for the clinical as-
sessment of insulin resistance in pediatric
population (39). Another approach
would be to develop a risk score for the
metabolic syndrome based on multivari-
ate modeling or on summing z-scores for
the components. Because such a risk
score is a continuous measure, one or
more cut points could be established,
leading to a classification such as having
or not having the metabolic syndrome or
such as low, medium, or high risk for the
metabolic syndrome.
In conclusion, our findings have im-
plications in clinical practice, epidemio-
logic research, and public health
surveillance. The one-factor model uses
valid, simple, and easily available mea-
sures to define the metabolic syndrome;
thus, it may facilitate the diagnosis of the
syndrome in clinical settings and the de-
velopment of a case definition for use in
surveillance. In addition, the model ap-
peared to be consistent across sex and ra-
cial/ethnic subgroups and therefore could
be generalized to diverse populations. It
might be of particular interest to use valid
and universally applicable measures to
define the metabolic syndrome in the pe-
diatric population, given the lack of a
standard pediatric definition of the syn-
drome to date.
