Depression as an Antecedent to Heart Disease
Among Women and Men in the NHANES I Study
Amy K. Ferketich, MA; Judith A. Schwartzbaum, PhD; David J. Frid, MD; Melvin L. Moeschberger, PhD
Background: Depression predicts morbidity and
mortality among individuals who have coronary heart
disease (CHD), and there is increasing evidence that
depression may also act as an antecedent to CHD. The
studies that have reported a relationship between
depression and CHD incidence or mortality either
were restricted to men only or analyzed women and
men together. The present investigation was con-
ducted to evaluate the differential effect depression
may have on CHD incidence and mortality in women
and men.
Research Methods: We analyzed data from 5007
women and 2886 men enrolled in the first National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) who were
free of CHD at the 1982-1984 interview and who had com-
pleted the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale (CES-D). Participants were evaluated from the 1982
interview date either until the end of the study (1992 in-
terview date) or until the occurrence of a CHD event. Us-
ing CHD incidence and CHD mortality (International Clas-
sification of Disease, Ninth Revision, codes 410-414) as the
outcome variables, Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion models were developed to evaluate the relative risk
(RR) of CHD incidence and mortality in the depressed
women and men separately, controlling for standard CHD
risk factors.
Results: The women experienced 187 nonfatal and 137
fatalevents,comparedwith187nonfataland129fatalevents
among the men. The adjusted RR of CHD incidence among
depressed women was 1.73 (95% confidence internal [CI],
1.11-2.68) compared with nondepressed women. Depres-
sion had no effect on CHD mortality in the women (RR,
0.74; 95% CI, 0.40-1.48). The adjusted RR of CHD inci-
dence among depressed men was 1.71 (95% CI, 1.14-
2.56) compared with nondepressed men. Depressed men
alsohad anincreased risk of CHDmortality comparedwith
their nondepressed counterparts, with an adjusted RR of
2.34 (95% CI, 1.54-3.56).
Conclusions: In this sample, while controlling for pos-
sible confounding factors, depression was associated with
an increased risk of CHD incidence in both men and
women, as well as CHD mortality in men. Depression had
no effect on CHD mortality in women.

DEPRESSION IS not unusual
among individuals with
coronary heart disease
(CHD), with studies in-
dicating that between
15% and 22% of patients suffer from de-
pression after a cardiac event.1 In pa-
tients who have CHD, depression is asso-
ciated with a reduction in both short- and
long-term survival. Barefoot and coau-
thors2 evaluated patients with CHD for up
to 19.4 years and found that depressed in-
dividuals experienced a greater risk of mor-
tality than did nondepressed individuals.
The authors speculate that long-term risk
may be caused by factors that advance ath-
erosclerosis, such as altered neuroendo-
crine function and failure to adhere to life-
style behaviors that are recommended for
the patient with CHD.
The question of whether depression
promotes CHD in individuals who are free
of disease has also been examined. The re-
sults from the Precursors Study3 indicate
that depression predicts CHD and myo-
cardial infarction (MI) in men, even after
adjusting for possible confounding vari-
ables. Barefoot and Schroll4 evaluated a
Danish cohort for 27 years and found that
depression was associated with an el-
evated risk of MI. The authors also re-
ported that a sex-depression interaction
was not statistically significant. How-
ever, there may have been too few events
to detect an interaction, since there were
only 30 events among the 366 women dur-
ing the follow-up. Pratt et al5 reported the
results from a follow-up study conduc-
ted on the Baltimore cohort of the Epi-
demiologic Catchment Area Study, a

METHODS
The NHANES I was conducted from 1971 through 1975
by the National Center for Health Statistics as a probabil-
ity sample of the noninstitutionalized population of the
United States. The design involved oversampling of cer-
tain subgroups, including women of childbearing age, the
elderly, and persons living in poverty areas. The survey in-
cluded questions on sociodemographics, medical history,
diet, and biochemical and anthropometric measures. Of the
original cohort, 14 407 adults were included in the Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Follow-up Study
(NHEFS). Follow-up interviews were conducted in 1982,
1986, 1987, and 1992. The 1982 follow-up interview in-
cluded an assessment of depression based on the Center
for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D). In the
present investigation, we analyzed the follow-up data for
the cohort of participants who completed the CES-D from
the 1982 interview date until the 1992 interview date. Of
the 8111 individuals who participated in the 1982 fol-
low-up interview and reported having no history of heart
disease, 7928 (97.7%) completed the self-administered de-
pression questionnaire. Compared with participants who
completed the CES-D, the participants who did not com-
plete the CES-D were older (58.2 vs 54.5 years) and of lower
socioeconomic status (243% vs 277% of the federal pov-
erty level). Furthermore, participants who did not com-
plete the CES-D were less likely to be married than par-
ticipants who completed the CES-D. However, the outcomes
were not associated with whether the CES-D was com-
pleted. Participants who did not complete the CES-D were
not at greater risk for nonfatal CHD (relative risk [RR], 1.11;
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-2.23) or fatal CHD (RR,
0.92; 95% CI, 0.47-1.79) compared with the completers.
DEFINITION OF DEPRESSION
The CES-D is a self-report scale designed to measure the
current prevalence of depressive symptoms in the general
population.7 The scale consists of a series of 20 questions,
and each question is rated from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating
that the symptom was experienced rarely or not at all dur-
ing the past week and 3 indicating that the symptom was
experienced most or all of the time during the past week.
A cutpoint of 16 was established for distinguishing be-
tween depressed and nondepressed patients because such
a score implies that many of the symptoms were assigned
a rating of 1 or 2, or at least 6 symptoms were assigned a
rating of 3.8 Also, the scores in several clinical populations
were compared with those in the general population, and
it was found that a score of 16 was a reasonable cut-
point.9,10 The reliability and validity of the CES-D have been
tested in community samples. The results indicate that the
internal consistency is high, the concurrent validity (agree-
ment with other measures of depression) and construct va-
lidity (ability to link scale items to attributes known to be
associated with depression) are good, and the test-retest
reliability is acceptable.7
While the CES-D is easy to administer and has the de-
sirable properties of consistency and validity, there are some
concerns with its screening ability. Roberts and Vernon11
have reported that the sensitivity using the standard cutpoint
of 16 is 60.0% for major depression and 71.4% for minor de-
pression, whereas the specificity estimates are 83.4% and
83.3%, respectively. Schein and Koenig12 reported the sen-
sitivity and specificity of the CES-D using the standard cut-
point in a sample of elderly inpatients. In their sample, the
sensitivity using 16 as the cutpoint for depression was 73%
for any depression and 90% for major depression. The asso-
ciated specificity estimates were 84% and 84%. Scores other
than the traditional cutpoint of 16 have been suggested to
classify depression. Husaini et al13 have recommended us-
ing scores of 17 or more and 23 or more to classify individu-
als as having "possible depression" and "probable depres-
sion," based on their findings in community samples.
Conceptually, these categories are similar to "normal depres-
sives"and"clinicaldepressives,"respectively.RobertsandVer-
non11 foundthatthespecificityformajordepressionwasquite
high using a cutpoint of 23 (93%) compared with the stan-
dard score of 16 (83.4%); however, the sensitivity was lower
with the higher cutpoint (40% vs 60%).
DEFINING THE STUDY COHORT
The participants who had complete data for the CES-D were
considered in the analysis (5946 women and 3560 men).
Next, individuals who reported a history of a physician-
diagnosed heart condition, heart attack, or angina were ex-
cluded (920 women and 658 men). An additional 20 women
and 14 men were excluded because of missing informa-
tion on covariates. Thus, the analysis is based on 5006
women and 2888 men.
As stated above, the cohort interviewed in 1982 was
evaluated until 1992, the year of the final follow-up inter-
view. At that time, all participants not experiencing the event
of interest were censored. That is, all follow-up informa-
tion was used on those participants even though the event
did not occur. Individuals lost to follow-up were censored
at their last interview date (either the 1986 or 1987 date).
If an individual did not participate in a follow-up inter-
view after the 1982 interview, he or she was censored at
0.25 year. The model used to analyze the data, a Cox pro-
portional hazards model, allows for censored data. There-
fore, rather than eliminate the information on the partici-
pants who were not interviewed after 1982 (n = 179), we
made the decision to use their information for 3 months.
Seven percent of those in the sample were lost to follow-
up. Participants lost to follow-up had higher depression
scores than those who were evaluated until the 1992 in-
terview (10.17 vs 7.91). Because depression scores were
higher among participants who did not complete the study,
the RR estimates for CHD incidence and mortality associ-
ated with depression may be conservative.
DEFINING THE FATAL EVENTS
Deaths among NHANES I cohort members were identi-
fied using the National Death Index and through tracing
of vital status via proxy interview. The underlying causes
of death on the death certificates are classified according
to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion (ICD-9). For this study, the codes 410 to 414 were used
to classify CHD-related deaths. We also looked at all-
cause mortality to determine if depression was related to
other fatal outcomes.

DEFINING THE NONFATAL EVENTS
To determine the incidence of nonfatal CHD events, data
from hospital discharge records were used. Medical
records were obtained from the hospitals where individu-
als had reported being hospitalized between 1982 and
1992. Discharge diagnoses were recorded by medical cod-
ers using ICD-9 codes. Each record included room for up
to 10 diagnoses. Individuals who had a record with at
least one ICD-9 code in the 410-414 range were defined as
having a CHD event. We also looked at the subgroup of
patients who had an ICD-9 code of either 410 (acute MI)
or 411 (other acute and subacute ischemic diseases), as
these codes represent acute events. Only first events were
considered; therefore, individuals ceased to contribute
time after the first diagnosis.
It is possible that the number of CHD events
obtained by reviewing the health care facility stay
records is lower than the number that actually occurred
in the sample. Between 1982 and 1992, 23 301 health
care facility stays were recorded.14-16 Fifty-six percent of
these records were matched to a participant self-report;
that is, a participant reported the stay and complete
information from the facility was available. Twenty-four
percent of the records were not matched. In these cases,
a participant reported a stay but no information from the
health care facility was available. Finally, 20% of the
records corresponded to additional stays found. Thus, a
facility reported an additional stay that was not reported
by the participant. Because 24% of the self-reports had
no associated information from the health care facility, it
is possible that a greater number of CHD events
occurred during the follow-up period. It is also possible
that more events occurred but were not reported by the
participant, and therefore no attempt was made to con-
tact the facility. No information is available for specific
diagnoses; however, if CHD event rates follow the same
pattern, this would be a problem of nondifferential mis-
classification. This type of misclassification would result
in an underestimation of the effect of depression in the
analyses.
DATA ANALYSIS
The percentage distributions for possible confounders
were first evaluated among depressed and nondepressed
participants separately in men and women. Race was cat-
egorized as white and black/other. Hypertension and dia-
betes were defined as a positive response to the questions
asking whether a physician had ever diagnosed the par-
ticipant with hypertension or diabetes. Smoking was
dichotomized into never/former and current smoker.
Alcohol use was ordered according to the total number of
drinks of beer, wine, and spirits: nondrinker, 1 drink or
less per day, and more than 1 drink per day. A self-report
assessment of the participant's usual recreational activity
was used to classify individuals as sedentary, engaging in
light exercise, or engaging in regular exercise. Marital sta-
tus was assessed with 3 categories: single, married, and
divorced/widowed/separated. Finally, the mean poverty
index (percentage of the US poverty level) and body mass
index (BMI) were compared between the depressed and
nondepressed participants.
The relationships between depression and CHD inci-
denceandbetweendepressionandCHDmortalitywereevalu-
ated separately in men and women using Cox proportional
hazards regression models. The data are left truncated, since
individuals entered the study free of disease at different ages.
Therefore, the analysis was conditional on the age at which
the participant entered and left the study (because of either
experiencing the event or being censored), because it is as-
sumed that the hazard changes more as a function of age than
oftimeinthestudy.Foradescriptionofthemethod,seeKlein
and Moeschberger17 and Korn et al.18
Four models were then developed to determine the
effect that depression had on CHD incidence and mortal-
ity in men and women, adjusting for confounding vari-
ables. A combination of backward elimination and for-
ward selection techniques was used to select variables. A
variable was included in the model either if P.20 or if its
removal affected the parameter estimate for depression by
at least 20%.19 In all of the models, continuous variables
were entered as continuous variables and quadratic func-
tions. The likelihood ratio test was used to determine if the
quadratic terms added significantly to the model. The fi-
nal model was then checked for proportional hazards by
comparing a model that included log(time) interactions with
each independent variable with the model that included only
the independent variables. The likelihood ratio test was used
to compare these 2 models. In the male incidence model,
smoking did not meet the proportional hazards assump-
tion. A term that accounted for the interaction between
smoking and log(time), which was the function of time used
to check the proportional hazards assumption, was in-
cluded in the final model.
In the mortality analyses we had to address the fact
that some patients had nonfatal CHD events prior to the
fatal CHD event. Nonfatal events predict depression and
they increase risk of CHD mortality. Thus, if caused by a
mechanism other than depression, nonfatal events should
be treated as a confounding variable in the relationship be-
tween depression and fatal CHD. On the other hand, non-
fatal CHD events are intermediate steps between depres-
sion and fatal CHD; that is, depression may lead to a nonfatal
event, which then results in fatal CHD. Although there are
methods for doing so, we did not have enough informa-
tion to treat depression as both a confounding variable and
an intermediate step in the fatal CHD analyses. Such an as-
sessment would have required repeated measurements of
depression over time. We decided to treat nonfatal events
as time-dependent covariates in the mortality analyses. This
resulted in conservative RR estimates; however, the con-
clusions did not differ from those in the models that did
not include nonfatal events as covariates (results not shown).
Interactions between depression and smoking and
between depression and poverty (135% of the poverty
level was selected as the cutpoint for defining poverty)
were then examined. The interactions between depression
and smoking and between depression and poverty were
chosen based on their relationship to depression and
CHD. Previous studies have shown that the prevalence of
depression has a negative relationship to household
income.8,20 Furthermore, living close to the poverty level
may be associated with an increased risk of CHD. Smoking

survey of psychiatric disorders in the general popula-
tion. A history of major depressive episode was associ-
ated with elevated odds of MI over the 13-year fol-
low-up period. The results were reported for men and
women together, and there was no mention of a pos-
sible interaction. It is likely that even if such an interac-
tion had been examined there would not have been
enough power to detect its presence since there were only
6 events among the individuals with a history of major
depressive disorder.
Anda et al6 used data from the first National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) to evalu-
ate the role of depression and hopelessness in CHD de-
velopment. A subsample of 6913 individuals completed
the General Well-being Schedule at the baseline inter-
view. After an average of 12.4 years of follow-up, depres-
sion was associated with an increased risk for both fatal
and nonfatal CHD. The authors did not report whether
the effect of depression on CHD differed between men-
and women.
Clearly, there is evidence that depression is related
to CHD incidence and mortality in men, however little
is known about how depression affects CHD risk in
women. As stated above, studies that have examined the
effect of depression on CHD incidence or mortality ei-
ther included only men, did not examine the possibility
of a differential effect of depression in men and women,
or tested for an interaction but observed none, likely ow-
ing to low power.
The prevalence of depression differs between men
and women. Women in the Barefoot and Schroll4 study
had significantly higher scores on the depression scale
than did the men. Similarly, Anda et al6 reported a higher
percentage of women with depressed affect than men
(13.5% vs 8.5%). In the Pratt et al5 investigation, 74% of
the participants with a history of major depressive dis-
order were female. Thus, there is evidence that women
tend to be more susceptible to depression than men.
Whether this higher susceptibility affects the relation-
ship between depression and CHD is not known. The pres-
ent investigation was conducted to test the hypothesis
that the effect of depression on CHD incidence and mor-
tality differs in men and women. A large, nationally rep-
resentative data set was used to examine this question.
RESULTS
The mean ± SD ages for the women and men were
53.7 ± 13.9 and 55.9 ± 14.4 years, respectively. The
mean ± SD CES-D score for the women was 8.79 ± 8.60.
Using 16 as the cutpoint for defining depression, 17.5%
of the women were classified as depressed. The men had
a lower mean ± SD CES-D score, 6.77 ± 7.13, and 9.7%
were depressed. The prevalence of sociodemographic and
cardiac risk factors among depressed men and women
is presented in Table 1. Among both men and women,
depressed individuals were more likely to be in the fol-
lowing categories: age 50-59 and 70+ years, black, smoker,
nondrinker, diabetic, hypertensive, sedentary, and not
married. Also, the mean poverty index was lower for de-
pressed men and women. Depressed women had a higher
BMI than women who were not depressed. The mean du-
ration of follow-up was 8.3 years (range, 0.02-11.1 years).
Women experienced 187 nonfatal and 137 fatal CHD
events. Men experienced 187 nonfatal and 129 fatal CHD
events.
DEPRESSION AND CHD IN WOMEN
The crude RR of nonfatal CHD among women scoring
16 or higher on the CES-D was 1.32 (95% CI, 0.94-1.87).
We then decided to use the cutpoint of 23 to define de-
pression in the female sample because, as stated above,
the higher score reduces the false-positive classification
rate from 16.6% to 7%.12 Also, women generally have
higher scores on the CES-D, and this may be because the
CES-D scale is sex biased. Stommel et al22 found that the
responses to 2 items on the CES-D ("talked less than
usual" and "had crying spells") depended on the sex of
the respondent, even after controlling for the general level
of depressive symptoms. It was thought that the higher
cutpoint would reduce the misclassification of depres-
sion among the truly nondepressed women. All further
results are based on the classification of depression us-
ing the cutpoint of 23. The crude RR of nonfatal CHD
among women scoring 23 or higher on the CES-D was
2.09 (95% CI, 1.35-3.23). Table 2 contains the crude
and adjusted RR estimates. The final model included the
following variables: poverty index and (poverty in-
dex)2, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and BMI. The ad-
justed RR of nonfatal CHD among depressed women was
1.73 (95% CI, 1.11-2.68). After eliminating the first 2 years
of follow-up, the risk decreased slightly, to 1.68 (95% CI,
1.01-2.79).
The crude and adjusted RR estimates of acute CHD
events (corresponding to ICD-9 codes 410 and 411)
is an established risk factor for CHD, and Anda et al21
reported that depression plays a role in an individu-
al's current smoking status and the probability of quit-
ting smoking. It is therefore possible that an inter-
action exists between depression and either poverty
level or smoking status.
To eliminate the possibility that subclinical dis-
ease biased the relationship between depression and
CHD, the analysis was performed a second time af-
ter excluding the first 2 years of follow-up. We also
wanted to eliminate the possibility that antidepres-
sant or tranquilizer use confounded the effect of de-
pression on CHD incidence and mortality, since these
medications may be related to mortality. We tested
for an effect of self-reported use of antidepressants
and tranquilizers at baseline (1982 interview) in the
final models.
We then looked at the effect of varying the cut-
point on the 2 outcomes. We computed age-
adjusted RR estimates for each outcome separately,
using each score between 0 and 25 as a possible cut-
point. The data became sparse after a CES-D score
of 25, and therefore the estimates may not be stable.
We did this separately for men and women and
then plotted the RR vs the CES-D score.

associated with depression among women are listed in
Table 2. The adjusted RR estimate of an acute event
among depressed women was 1.56 (95% CI, 0.80-3.03).
There were only 88 such events; therefore, there may
not have been enough power to detect a significant
elevation in risk.
The crude RR for fatal CHD associated with depres-
sion among women was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.53-1.94). After
adjusting for poverty index, smoking, diabetes, BMI, and
nonfatal events during the follow-up period, the RR de-
creased to 0.74 (95% CI, 0.40-1.48). The adjusted RR of
all-cause mortality associated with depression among
women was 1.21 (95% CI, 0.90-1.62). Depression there-
fore had no effect on fatal CHD or on all-cause mortality
among women. The RR estimates for fatal events are listed
in Table 2.
Neither tranquilizer use nor antidepressant use had
an effect on CHD incidence and mortality among women,
and use of these medications did not affect the RR esti-
mates associated with depression (results not shown).
The RR estimates of nonfatal CHD for smokers who
were not depressed and depressed participants who were
not smokers, compared with those who did not smoke
and were not depressed, were similar: 1.66 (95% CI, 1.00-
2.78) and 1.75 (95% CI, 1.19-2.57), respectively. How-
ever, the RR estimate for smokers who were depressed
compared with those who did not smoke and were not
depressed was 3.38 (95% CI, 1.47-7.78). A statistical test
for the interaction term was not significant (P = .77). No
interaction between poverty and depression was appar-
ent, and no interaction effects on the fatal event out-
come were tested because of sparse data among de-
pressed participants in some of the categories.
DEPRESSION AND CHD IN MEN
The standard cutpoint of 16 on the CES-D was used to
classify depression among men. The crude RR of nonfa-
tal CHD associated with depression among men was 1.79
(95% CI, 1.19-2.67). After adjusting for poverty index,
race, hypertension, BMI, smoking and smoking  log
(time), the RR estimate decreased slightly, to 1.71 (95%
CI, 1.14-2.56). Table 3 contains the crude and ad-
justed RR estimates. After eliminating the first 2 years of
follow-up, the RR of CHD among the depressed men ac-
tually increased, to 2.03 (95% CI, 1.28-3.22).
There were 102 acute CHD events among the male
cohort (ICD-9 codes 410 and 411). The crude and ad-

justed RR estimates of acute events associated with de-
pression among men are listed in Table 3. Depression had
no effect on the incidence of an acute CHD event among
men (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.61-2.14).
Mortality risk estimates also differed between de-
pressed and nondepressed men. The crude RR of CHD
mortality associated with depression among men was 2.73
(95% CI, 1.81-4.12). After adjusting for poverty index,
BMI, race, diabetes, hypertension, and nonfatal events dur-
ing the follow-up period, the RR estimate decreased to
2.34 (95% CI, 1.54-3.56). Eliminating the first 2 years
of follow-up resulted in a slight attenuation of the RR,
to 2.08 (95% CI, 1.28-3.38). The adjusted RR of all-
cause mortality associated with depression among men
was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.35-2.11). Table 3 lists the crude and
adjusted RR estimates for fatal events associated with de-
pression among men.
Neither self-reported tranquilizer use nor antide-
pressant use had an independent effect on CHD in-
cidence and mortality, and use of these medications
did not affect the RR estimates associated with depres-
sion among men. None of the interactions tested was
significant.
VARYING THE CUTPOINT
TO DEFINE DEPRESSION
Varying the cutpoint resulted in different patterns in men
and women, and the patterns further differed according
to the outcome. The results are presented in Figure 1.
First, in women, there is only a slight increase in risk with
each 1-point increase in the cutpoint until a CES-D score
of 20, after which the risk increases more dramatically
with each 1-point increase. In men, the risk increases
slightly with each 1-point increase in the cutpoint until
the CES-D score reaches 12, after which the RR esti-
mates begin to increase more steeply. The RR estimates
then decrease below 1.5 above a cutpoint of 20. It is im-
portant to note that there were only 10 events among the
men who scored above 20. Therefore, these RR esti-
mates may not be stable because of the sparse data. To
assess which cutpoint is optimal, we looked at the -2 log
likelihood from each model. The cutpoint that results in
the model with the smallest -2 log likelihood (or largest
log likelihood) is the optimal cutpoint.17 Among women,
the model with the smallest -2 log likelihood was the one
that used 24 as a cutpoint, and among men it was the
model that used 15. We then evaluated the CES-D score
as a continuous variable, adjusting for the potential con-
founders. Among women, a quadratic term for CES-D
score was significant (P = .03). Among men, only the lin-
ear term was significant (P = .02). Therefore, 2 different
continuous functions explained the relationship be-
tween CES-D score and nonfatal CHD events in men and
women.
An entirely different pattern emerged when the fa-
tal RR estimates were plotted against the CES-D score
(Figure 2). Varying the cutpoint did nothing to alter
the RR estimates in women. However, in men, begin-
ning at a score of 10, the RR estimates increase rather
sharply. As we did with CHD incidence, we determined

model -2 log likelihood values. For the men, 25 was the
optimal cutpoint, and for the women, all models re-
sulted in a similar -2 log likelihood value. We also ana-
lyzed the CES-D score as a continuous variable, and in
the men a quadratic term was significant, even after ad-
justing for covariates (P.001).
COMMENT
This study is the first to demonstrate that depression af-
fects CHD risk in women. We have shown that the ef-
fect of depression on CHD risk differs in men and women.
More severe levels of depression were related to nonfa-
tal CHD events in women, but there was no relationship
to fatal CHD. Among men, depression was related to both
nonfatal and fatal CHD.
These findings are in agreement with previous in-
vestigations that analyzed the effect of depression on CHD
incidence and mortality. As in the present investigation,
Anda et al6 evaluated data from NHANES I; however, they
used the General Well-being Schedule to define depres-
sion, and their cohort consisted of the augmented sample
interviewed at the baseline interview. They reported that
the adjusted RRs of CHD incidence and mortality among
depressed participants were 1.6 (95% CI, 1.1-2.4) and
1.5 (95% CI, 1.0-2.3), respectively. Similarly, Barefoot
and Schroll4 reported an effect of depression on fatal and
nonfatal myocardial infarction (adjusted RR, 1.7; 95% CI,
1.2-2.3). The recent data from the Precursors Study3 also
suggest that depression acts as an antecedent to CHD.
In their male cohort, the adjusted RR of CHD among de-
pressed participants was 2.1 (95% CI, 1.2-3.6).
It is unclear why depression is related to CHD in-
cidence but not mortality in women. In the Precursors
Study,3 depressed men had an increased risk of total CHD
events but not CHD mortality. However, Anda et al6 found
that depression had a similar relationship to fatal and non-
fatal outcomes. In the present investigation, the effect of
depression on CHD mortality was greater than its effect
on CHD incidence in the male cohort.
Depression was only measured once, at the begin-
ning of the study, which is the main limitation of this
study. Serial measurements would have provided infor-
mation on the dynamics of depression and how changes
in depression affect CHD. Also, we could have evalu-
ated chronicity and severity of depression and how these
2 indices relate to heart disease. Other investigators have
faced a similar problem.4,6 In his original report on the
properties of the CES-D, Radloff7 reported that the 1-year
test-retest correlation (of total score) was 0.49 in a com-
munity sample. It is therefore possible that many of the
individuals classified as depressed in 1982 remained in
that classification throughout the follow-up period.
Another limitation of the study was the lack of in-
formation on serum cholesterol level in the 1982 inter-
view. We cannot rule out the possibility that the results
may be confounded because of unmeasured serum cho-
lesterol levels. Other investigators had information on this
risk factor, and controlling for cholesterol did not di-
minish the effect of depression on CHD.3,4,6 Thus, it is
unlikely that unmeasured serum cholesterol levels acted
as a strong confounding variable in the present study.
The strengths of this study include its prospective
design, large sample, and relatively long follow-up pe-
riod. Also, unlike previous studies of depression and CHD,
we were able to analyze depression effects separately in
women and men. Another strength of the present study
and the NHANES I data set in general was the ability to
control for many cardiac risk factors and demographic
variables.
The present analyses controlled for baseline car-
diac risk factors, socioeconomic status, and preexisting
disease. Some of the participants may have had subclini-
cal disease, which could have had an impact on both the
CES-D score and the CHD event. After eliminating the
first 2 years of follow-up, the relationships between de-
pression and nonfatal CHD remained in both men and
women, and the relationship between depression and fa-
tal CHD remained in men; this indicates that subclini-
cal disease did not affect the results.
There are several pathways by which depression
may act to increase the risk of CHD. First, there is a
general clustering of behavioral risk factors among
depressed individuals that may affect the development
of CHD. Depressed individuals are more likely to be
current smokers and less likely to quit smoking than
nondepressed individuals.21 In the present investiga-
tion, standard cardiac risk factors were controlled for in
the analyses, making confounding by known risk fac-
tors an unlikely explanation. The second explanation
for the relationship between depression and CHD is
that altered autonomic tone affects heart rate variability,
which then increases susceptibility to CHD. Carney et
al23 reported that depressed CHD patients had lower
heart rate variability compared with nondepressed CHD
patients, and this relationship was not caused by disease
severity. The authors stated that lower heart rate vari-
ability was likely related to dysregulation of the auto-
nomic nervous system, and it could place the individual
at greater risk of ventricular fibrillation, leading to an
increased risk of CHD death. Another possible mecha-
nism linking depression to CHD is increased platelet
aggregation. Fielding24 reviewed the literature and
stated that elevated sympathetic activity may be present
in depressed patients. Sympathetic catecholamines may

activate platelets and stimulate platelet-derived growth
factor formation.25
Future research should focus on defining the mecha-
nism that links depression to elevated CHD risk in a non-
coronary patient population. After specifying this rela-
tionship, interventions (behavioral and pharmacological)
to reduce the risk of CHD in depressed individuals can
be tested. Studies should also further examine the un-
derlying relationship between depression and CHD. We
found that continuous functions explained the relation-
ship between depression score and nonfatal events in men
and women and between depression score and fatal events
in men. Analyzing the score as a continuous variable may
be more desirable than classifying depression according
to a cutpoint because misclassification of depression near
the cutpoint could bias the results.
