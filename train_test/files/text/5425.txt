Academic observers of the 2016 US presidential election
noted that Republican nominee and eventual winner
Donald Trump enjoyed outsize support among voters with
authoritarian views of the family (Federico et al., 2016;
Lakoff, 2016; Taub, 2016; but see Enders and Smallpage,
2016; Rahn and Oliver, 2016). Academics and journalists
also described candidate behaviors suggesting indifference
toward certain norms of liberal, presidential democracy
(Dahl, 1971), including tolerance of dissent, press free-
dom, and judicial independence (Farhi, 2016; Lind, 2016;
Liptak, 2016). An apparent implication is that these phe-
nomena are linked: that "authoritarian" citizens--those
believing the home should be structured in a top-down
fashion with the father as the ultimate authority--support
candidates promising to take charge of the national hier-
archy, at the expense of liberal democratic norms. Yet,
because few presidential candidates have displayed sig-
nificant illiberal tendencies in recent US elections, there is
little historical evidence regarding whether authoritarian
parenting attitudes lead US citizens to support candidates
with strongman leadership styles.
Latin America, in contrast, is a region rich with examples
of strongmen engaging in democratic politics. In some
countries (e.g. Honduras, Mexico, Peru), rightist candidates
have promoted "mano dura" or hardline crime policies calling
for an explicit tradeoff between citizens'liberties and national
security. Leftist leaders in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela
have limited press freedoms and civil liberties, and sought to
reduce institutional checks on executive power. This wide
range of authoritarian leaders presents an ideal environment
for assessing the effects of authoritarian parenting attitudes.
We conceptualize "authoritarianism" differently for citi-
zens and candidates. At the mass level, "authoritarianism"
is a psychological trait emphasizing submission to author-
ity and group norms, and involving aggression toward non-
conformists (Feldman, 2003; Stenner, 2005).1 Scholars
have measured the trait using several batteries, including
the "F-scale" (or "fascism" scale), which fell out of favor

Evidence from Latin America

Abstract
During the 2016 presidential election campaign in the United States, scholars argued that authoritarian visions of the
family are associated with support for Donald Trump, a candidate also noted to exhibit authoritarian or illiberal tendencies.
Though it is plausible that "authoritarian" citizens (defined by parenting attitudes) vote for "authoritarian" candidates
(defined by disrespect for democratic institutions), past research provides relatively little guide regarding this relationship.
One reason is that few US candidates announce overtly authoritarian views. Latin America, by contrast, has had many such
candidates. We take advantage of this variation using the 2012 AmericasBarometer, which applied a battery of authoritarian
parenting attitudes. We first describe mass authoritarianism across Latin America, showing it is associated with many social
attitudes. We then examine authoritarians' voting behavior, distinguishing between support for "mano dura" ("strong arm")
candidates, who are usually rightists, and for candidates threatening violations of general civil liberties, who are often leftists
in Latin America. We find that authoritarians tend to vote for right-wing authoritarian candidates, while authoritarianism
boosts support for candidates threatening civil liberty violations only among citizens identifying on the ideological right.
Education is the most consistent determinant reducing support for both leftist and rightist authoritarian candidates.

due to high acquiescence bias and low reliability (see
Altemeyer, 1981), and the more reliable "right wing author-
itarianism" (RWA) measure. Because RWA conflates moral
conservatism with aggression to outsiders and preference
for authority (Duckitt et al., 2010; Feldman, 2003;
Hetherington and Weiler, 2009), recent studies use a battery
on child-rearing preferences to capture "adherence to
authority" independent of conservatism (Stenner 2005). We
assess mass-level authoritarianism using a measure of
authoritarian parenting attitudes.
At the elite level, we define authoritarianism not as a
preference for familial hierarchy, but rather as an attitude of
disregard toward liberal democratic protections of citizens'
rights. We gauge candidates' levels of authoritarianism
through public statements and behavior. Linking both con-
ceptualizations is the core idea that the relevant social
entity--the family or the state--should have a single, unre-
strained leader who is owed obedience.
Are mass- and elite-level authoritarianism connected?
RWA is correlated with opposition to civil rights and liber-
ties and support for governmental abuses of power (Duckitt
et al., 2010; Stellmacher and Petzel, 2005). Both authoritar-
ian parenting attitudes and RWA are associated with sup-
port for populists and rightists (Billiet and de Witte, 1995;
Duckitt et al., 2010; Mayer and Perrineau, 1992; McCann,
2009; Tibon and Blumberg, 1999). However, scholars have
not linked authoritarian parenting attitudes to support for
candidates promoting authoritarian policies. In light of
scholarly explanations of the 2016 US presidential election,
this question has become increasingly salient. Evidence
from Latin America can illuminate whether or not authori-
tarian voters actually support authoritarian candidates.
In Latin America, support for authoritarian leaders has
been explained using standard determinants of presidential
support such as economic performance (Kutiyski and
Krouwel, 2014) and access to political information (Geddes
and Zaller, 1989). In contrast to scholars of US political
behavior, Latin Americanists have generally conceptual-
ized mass-level authoritarianism not based on parenting
attitudes, but rather as what we call "institutional authori-
tarianism": disrespect for democracy in the abstract, or for
particular institutions such as the judiciary. Individuals who
are ambivalent toward democratic institutions are more
receptive to illegal electoral tactics such as vote buying
(Carlin and Moseley, 2015) and more supportive of authori-
tarian leaders (Canache, 2002; Kutiyski and Krouwel,
2014). However, mass-level institutional authoritarianism
is different from authoritarian parenting; these dispositions
might even be negatively correlated. Because democratic
institutions--or at least, free elections--constitute the sta-
tus quo in Latin America, citizens who respect authority
might feel compelled to voice respect for democracy and
for particular institutions. At the elite level, however, there
is evidence of a positive association--Latin American leg-
islators expressing hostility to those outside the social order
are more amenable toward non-democratic government
alternatives (Stevens et al., 2006).
Since authoritarian parenting measures have not been
widely used in Latin America, we first validate our scale. In
our main analysis, we ask whether authoritarianism predicts
support for authoritarian presidential candidates in past or
hypothetical elections, while accounting for ideology. We
find that authoritarian citizens tend to vote for right-wing
authoritarian candidates.Authoritarianism does boost support
for leftist authoritarian candidates, who typically threaten
civil liberty violations, but only among citizens on the politi-
cal right; among centrist and leftist voters, authoritarianism
is not correlated with support for leftist authoritarian leaders.
The most consistent determinant of voting for authoritarian
leaders is not attitudinal; education reduces support for
authoritarian candidates on both the right and left.
Authoritarianism in Latin America:
Levels and convergent validity
We begin by examining authoritarian parenting attitudes
across Latin America utilizing a three-question battery
administered to half of AmericasBarometer 2012 respond-
ents.2 Respondents were asked: "[T]alking about the qual-
ities that children ought to have, I am going to mention
various characteristics and I would like you to tell me
which one is the most important for a child." Paired
response options included, "Independence" or "Respect
for adults"; "Obedience" or "Autonomy (self-sufficiency,
taking care of oneself)"; and "Creativity" or "Discipline."
Responses of "Independence," "Autonomy," and "Crea-
tivity" each received values of 0, while "Respect for
adults," "Obedience," and "Discipline" received values of
1. Volunteered responses that "both" were important were
scored 0.5. Authoritarian parenting attitudes (abbreviated
to authoritarianism) is the mean of the three scores, and
ranges from 0 to 1.
Figure 1 presents mean levels of authoritarianism in the
18 Latin American countries, plus the United States and
Canada for reference. Scores were rescaled for just this
analysis from 0 to 100. Authoritarianism is lowest in the
two Anglo-North American countries, where means are
close to the midpoint. Chile and Argentina have the lowest
means in Latin America, around 66. At the top end, mean
authoritarianism is close to 90 on the 0 to 100 scale in El
Salvador and the Dominican Republic.
As a first step in investigating the battery's validity, we
assess non-response and scale reliability (see the
Supplementary Information). High non-response would
suggest that respondents had difficulty understanding the
questions or that their responses had failed to match the pre-
coded categories. However, on average across the region,
non-response on each of the three items is about 1%.
Ecuador has the highest non-response rates, at 2.7, 4.0, and
4.1%, respectively. Cronbach's alpha calculations are more
Cohen and Smith 3
concerning. Reliability coefficients are low in all countries,
and extremely low in some. This will reduce the magnitude
of measured effects, biasing against finding statistically sig-
nificant results.
Do Latin Americans' responses validly represent a con-
struct developed initially in the United States? Pérez and
Hetherington (2014) show the battery does not predict the
political views of US African Americans. They argue that
while members of the racially dominant group implicitly
view the polity through a family metaphor, racially subor-
dinate citizens do not. It is worth investigating, then,
whether authoritarian parenting and political attitudes are
associated among Latin Americans.
Figure 2 presents partial correlation coefficients between
the authoritarian parenting battery and other behavioral and
attitudinal measures across the Latin American countries in
our sample, controlling for country fixed effects (see the
Supplementary Information for question text). If this bat-
tery lacks convergent validity, we cannot expect responses
to predict voting behavior. Two general findings stand out.
First, the battery is indeed associated with theoretically rel-
evant personal attributes, including political tolerance and
support for media censorship. Second, the correlations are
low, despite their statistical significance. We also note a
more specific finding: in Latin America, support for social
welfare is positively associated with authoritarianism.
While this runs opposite to common wisdom in US politics,
new research indicates that personality's effect on eco-
nomic attitudes is variable and contingent on political con-
text (e.g., Johnston et al., forthcoming; Malka et al., 2014).
Figure 2 also reports the battery's association with two
measures of institutional authoritarianism: support for
democracy in the abstract, and support for the political sys-
tem. Low support for democracy and low support for exist-
ing democratic institutions would correspond to high
institutional authoritarianism--that is, rejection of demo-
cratic institutions. Confirming the discussion above,
authoritarian parenting is not positively associated with
institutional authoritarianism. It is uncorrelated with sup-
port for democracy, while it has a small positive correlation
with support for the political system.
Do authoritarians support
authoritarians?
We turn to the question of whether Latin Americans with
authoritarian parenting attitudes tend to favor candidates
exhibiting authoritarian tendencies. The analysis is limited
to presidential systems, where authoritarian executives are
most common and powerful. We examine both self-
reported retrospective vote in the most recent election and
prospective vote "if the election were this week."3 We
coded candidate authoritarianism using English- and

Spanish-language journalistic accounts of the elections
prior to and following 2012 AmericasBarometer data col-
lection, located via Google News and Lexis Nexis searches
(see Supplementary Materials). We searched for evidence
of prospective or prior infringement on civil liberties such
as the freedom of the press. We tracked ties to non-demo-
cratic regimes or coups--for example, Peruvian candidate
Keiko Fujimori's link to her father's electoral authoritarian
regime in the 1990s, or her opponent Ollanta Humala's
coup attempt. We also coded support for hardline (mano
dura) crime enforcement policies threatening civil liber-
ties violations; for instance, militarization of the civilian
police, or incarceration of suspects on the basis of physical
characteristics such as tattoos.
We coded leaders' left-wing or right-wing orientation
based on the self-reported ideological position of support-
ers with high levels of political knowledge, adjusting for
country-level skew in the ideological spectrum. Politicians
whose most knowledgeable supporters placed themselves
to the right of the average citizen were coded as "right-
wing"; those to the left as "left-wing." Most candidates pro-
moting hardline policies were rightists, but candidates
potentially infringing civil liberties tended to be leftists. At
the time the poll was conducted, most left-wing authoritar-
ian candidates were incumbents, while the rightists tended
to be in the opposition.
Table 1 assesses the association between authoritarian
parenting attitudes and prior vote for authoritarians.4 The
first, third, and fifth columns present simple logistic regres-
sion models controlling only for demographics and country
fixed effects. The second, fourth, and sixth columns add
other public opinion variables measuring ideology and
(low) institutional authoritarianism: an indicator for self-
identification as rightist (i.e. as 8­10 on the 1­10 ideology
scale); support for democracy in the abstract; and support
for the current political system. To aid comparison of coef-
ficients, all variables are standardized on a 0­1 scale. The
first major finding is that authoritarian parenting attitudes
are associated with support for authoritarian leaders--but
only right-wing leaders. Education decreases voting for
both left-wing and right-wing authoritarians. This finding
is consistent across model specifications. Indeed, the pre-
dicted probability of having voted for any authoritarian in
the previous election drops from .45 for those without
schooling to .35 for those with higher education, suggesting
this variable is key to understanding support for authoritar-
ian candidacies. Supporters of left-wing authoritarians are
also less wealthy and of darker skin tone, on average.
The second analysis for each dependent variable includes
attitudinal controls. Coefficients for authoritarian parenting
attitudes remain essentially unchanged. Not surprisingly,
self-identified rightists are more likely to vote for right-
wing authoritarians, and less likely to vote for left-wing
ones. More interestingly, support for democracy in the
abstract is positively associated with voting for authoritari-
ans. The variable is statistically significant in models

excluding system support, but becomes statistically
insignificant in the full model (see the Supplementary
Information). Most strikingly, support for the existing politi-
cal order is strongly correlated with a left-wing authoritarian
vote.5 This may be due to reverse-causality: all six left-wing
authoritarians analyzed won their respective elections and
became forceful presidents evincing little tolerance for the
opposition. In majoritarian systems, there are large gaps
between winners and losers in the perceived legitimacy of
the political system (Anderson and Guillory, 1997;Anderson
et al., 2005, Carlin and Singer, 2011).6 Given the majoritar-
ian nature of these presidential terms, one might expect
polarization in system support. Nonetheless, it is striking
that even among supporters of right-wing authoritarian can-
didates, all but one of whom lost, support for democracy and
the political system are positively, though not significantly,
associated with voting for authoritarians.
Does the impact of authoritarianism vary by respondent
ideology? Authoritarians tend to self-identify with the
political right, yet the translation from underlying disposi-
tions to ideology is far from perfect. Rightists can be non-
authoritarian, and authoritarians can identify as centrists
or leftists. We suspect, however, that non-authoritarian and
authoritarian rightists behave differently, with non-authori-
tarian rightists more strongly opposing left-wing authori-
tarian leaders. Figure 3 shows the predicted probability
of supporting left-wing and right-wing authoritarian can-
didates, by personal authoritarianism and ideological
identification (see the Supplementary Information for full
models, and results incorporating an indicator for leftists).
We find a statistically significant interaction between
authoritarianism and rightism in predicting support for left-
wing authoritarians. While rightism consistently reduces
voting for left-wing authoritarians, the size of the gap var-
ies across the range of authoritarianism. In other words,
authoritarian rightists are willing to put aside their ideologi-
cal convictions and to support a leader with an authoritarian
style, even though the leader is of the left.
Finally, we examine prospective support for authoritar-
ian candidates, utilizing a question asking what respond-
ents would do "if the next election were held this week":
vote for the incumbent party or candidate, vote for the
opposition, abstain, or vote blank/null. We focus on voting
for/against incumbents. Opposition support is hard to inter-
pret, since in many countries it was unclear which opposi-
tion candidates would run, and most elections had multiple
opposition candidates. We expect authoritarian voters to
support authoritarian incumbents, reflecting their prefer-
ences for order and the status quo.7 Contrary to expecta-
tions, however, in the Supplementary Information, we
show that authoritarianism is not significantly associated
with supporting incumbent authoritarians over their oppo-
nents. This might be due to the fact that the authoritarian
incumbents in this study were all leftists; recall that author-
itarianism is not significantly associated with voting for
leftist authoritarians in the previous analysis.
Figure 3. Authoritarianism and rightism as determinants of support for authoritarian candidates.
6 Research and Politics 
In countries without authoritarian candidates, authori-
tarians may support rightists. In the United States, for
instance, authoritarian parenting attitudes are correlated
with Republicanism (Duckitt et al., 2010) though few
Republican candidates take overtly anti-democratic
stances. Figure 4 presents coefficients for the authoritar-
ian parenting battery from multinomial logistic regression
models run in every country.8 The baseline category
within each country is support for the incumbent.
Authoritarian parenting attitudes are not significantly
associated with prospective vote in most countries. In the
few cases where the coefficient of the parenting battery is
statistically significant, there are no obvious authoritarian
candidates in the previous or following elections. In
Uruguay, for instance, neither then-incumbent President
José Mujica nor any conservative opposition party could
reasonably be termed authoritarian. The same goes for
then-incumbent Laura Chinchilla and the center-left
opposition in Costa Rica. In these cases, authoritarianism
is associated with rightism, suggesting the political right's
appeal to those with authoritarian parenting attitudes is
independent of candidate stances vis-à-vis the institu-
tional democratic order.
Discussion and conclusion
To answer the question posed in the title, based on observing
18 Latin American countries: Yes, authoritarians--defined
by parenting attitudes--do tend to vote for authoritarian
candidates--defined by disregard for civil liberties and
democratic checks and balances. The link is strongest when
right-wing authoritarians run for office, but parenting atti-
tudes also predict rightist voters' support for left-wing
authoritarian candidates. We believe this is because authori-
tarians gravitate to rightist ideology, which is more consist-
ent with hierarchical values, while only non-authoritarian
rightists--oftentimes economic liberals--strongly oppose
left-wing authoritarians. Authoritarian rightists may be will-
ing to sacrifice their ideological positions in exchange for
authoritarian leadership, even if those leaders are on the left.
In the prospective vote choice analysis, however, we obtain
an unexpected result: parenting attitudes are associated with
support for rightist incumbents and opposition to leftists, but
not with support for authoritarians, in particular. We cannot
determine why authoritarianism is unassociated with voting
for leftist authoritarian incumbents in the present paper,
though a few explanations might be possible. Perhaps citi-
zens with authoritarian dispositions are attracted to the lead-
ership style of leftist authoritarians, yet oppose them on
ideological grounds, leading to an apparent null effect.
Alternatively, perhaps the result is simply due to problems
in measuring prospective vote choice.
Together, the analyses indicate that--at least in Latin
America--those with authoritarian parenting attitudes are
more strongly attracted to rightists in general than to
potentially authoritarian candidates. If these results extend
to the US case, they suggest that the parenting battery's
association with Republicanism--and with support for

Cohen and Smith 7
Donald Trump--might result more from conservative ide-
ology than from any particular authoritarian stances on
civil rights or checks on the executive. Still, when leftist
authoritarian leaders hold power for extended periods of
time (e.g. contemporary Venezuela, or the former Soviet
Bloc), authoritarian citizens might eventually identify as
leftists (de Regt et al., 2011).
For students of Latin America, the results imply that
democratic legitimacy does not form a bulwark against
electoral authoritarianism. Support for authoritarian candi-
dates is not a product of negative attitudes toward democ-
racy or existing political institutions. Instead, citizens who
support democracy and the current system may be more
likely to choose authoritarians, though the direction of cau-
sality remains for future study.
What, then, leads citizens to elect authoritarians?
Proponents of liberal democracy should note the consistent
role of education. Why does education buffer citizens
against authoritarian claims on the left and right? Perhaps
the effect relates to norms conveyed in public classrooms,
or perhaps to some incidental social advantage. In either
case, it appears the "schools of democracy" may, in fact, be
schools.

Notes
1. While some argue that authoritarianism is consistently
salient (Altemeyer, 1996; Hetheringon and Suhay, 2011;
Hetherington and Weiler, 2009), others maintain authori-
tarianism is a latent trait activated under threat (Feldman,
2003; Merolla and Zechmeister, 2009; Stenner, 2005). We
are agnostic on this debate.
2. The AmericasBarometer 2012 consisted of nationally rep-
resentative samples of at least 1,500 interviews in each of
26 countries, using complex, stratified sample designs.
Interviews were face-to-face throughout Latin America.
Analysis adjusts for survey design effects. In multicountry
analyses, we weight all countries equally.
3. Retrospective vote is based on item VB3, and focuses on the
first round in two-round elections. Prospective vote is based
on item VB20.
4. The left-wing authoritarians include Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua
2011), Rafael Correa (Ecuador 2009, 2013), Evo Morales
(Bolivia 2009, 2014), Ollanta Humala (Peru 2011), Hugo
Chávez (Venezuela 2006, 2012), and Cristina Fernández de
Kirchner (Argentina 2011), all of whom won their respec-
tive elections. The right-wing authoritarians include Manuel
Baldizón and Otto Pérez Molina (Guatemala 2011), Rodrigo
Ávila (El Salvador 2009), Elvin Santos (Honduras 2009), and
Keiko Fujimori (Peru 2011, 2016); of these, only Pérez Molina
won. We examine only countries with authoritarian candidates
of the respective types. Non-voters are coded as missing.
Blank voters are coded as voting against the authoritarian.
5. In the Supplemental Information, we present a combined
model interacting the type of authoritarian candidate (left-
wing or right-wing) with each attitudinal control. The inter-
actions between candidate type and authoritarian parenting
and support for democracy are not statistically significant.
However, the effect of system support varies significantly by
candidate type.
6. In the Supplementary Information, results from multinomial
logistic regression models show that support for democracy
and the political system are also associated with prospective
voting for authoritarian incumbents, replicating results from
the retrospective vote analysis.
7. Incumbent authoritarians were found in Honduras,
Nicaragua, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Venezuela. We exclude
Mexico under Calderón's mano dura policies because of the
lack of reelection in Mexico.
8. In the Supplementary Information, we present prospective
vote choice analysis for four groups of countries, coding
incumbents as authoritarian or non-authoritarian and leftist
or rightist. Strikingly, authoritarianism is only associated
with support for non-authoritarian incumbents.
