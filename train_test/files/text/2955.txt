Abstract:
This paper investigates the role of corporate taxation with respect to a multinational's
investment decision, in which the multinational can pursue either a direct or an indirect
investment strategy. The latter involves at least three corporate entities and opens up
enhanced opportunities for international tax planning. The existence of preferential tax
treatment for conduit or intermediate corporate entities presumably changes the role of
corporate taxation in destination countries, because it supports multinationals in avoiding
taxes. The empirical findings of this study are consistent with theoretical predictions and
suggest that tax effects differ, depending on the investment regime. The endogeneity of the
structural choice--direct versus indirect--is taken into account by a switching regression
approach.
Keywords: multinational company, business taxes, firm-level data, switching regression

Non technical summary
This study investigates how taxes affect the affiliate-level investment decision of German
multinationals, taking into account that a significant share of outbound investments are
indirect rather than direct. While we consider direct investments as simple bilateral structures
(a parent firm investing in a foreign affiliate), indirect strategies involve at least three
companies, where the parent is investing via a conduit or intermediate entity in another
foreign enterprise. Indirect investment structures possibly open up enhanced opportunities for
multinationals to avoid taxes, and hence, presumably change the role of corporate taxation in
destination countries.
A theoretical model, distinguishing between direct and indirect structures, yields different
corporate tax effects, depending on the respective regime. The empirical analysis, based on
the MiDi data of the Bundesbank, follows the theoretical model and empirically confirms our
expectations. If we consider tax wedges we obtain from the theoretical analysis, we find
adverse effects on affiliate-level investment for both regimes. The empirical results, where we
take into account the endogeneity of the regime choice (direct versus indirect) by a switching
regression approach, suggest that an increase in the cost of capital reduces indirect
investments more than direct effects.
The findings suggest also that income can be transferred to the German parent without tax
deduction, implying that multinationals actually exploit indirect investment structures to avoid
taxes. This may imply that the existence of conduit structures and low-tax conduit countries
reduces the downward pressure on tax rates. However, since tax competition is a phenomenon
which is not confined to one specific aspect, tax competition for intermediate entities may
well be intensified.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht die Investitionstätigkeit von Auslandstöchtern, die von
deutschen multinationalen Konzernen gehalten werden. Dabei berücksichtigt die
Untersuchung, ob es sich um eine direkte oder um eine indirekte Beteiligung handelt. Bei
einer direkten Beteiligung investiert die deutsche Muttergesellschaft direkt in eine
ausländische Tochtergesellschaft während bei einer indirekten Beteiligung mindestens eine
dritte Unternehmenseinheit involviert ist. Die Auslandstochter wird dann über eine
zwischengeschaltete Gesellschaft gehalten. Dies eröffnet zusätzliche Möglichkeiten zur
Steuerplanung. Falls diese genutzt werden und indirekte Strukturen steuerlich motiviert sind,
ändert sich dementsprechend auch der Charakter des steuerlichen Einflusses im Zielland.
Die Studie zeigt zunächst anhand theoretischer Überlegungen, dass sich die Steuereffekte in
der Tat unterscheiden, je nachdem, ob das Investitionsobjekt direkt oder indirekt gehalten
wird. Zur empirischen Analyse werden Direktinvestitionsdaten der Bundesbank
herangezogen. Die Ergebnisse bestätigen unsere theoretischen Vorhersagen: Der tarifliche
Steuersatz des Ziellandes wirkt erwartungsgemäß negativ auf die Investitionstätigkeit. Im
Falle der indirekten Investitionen wird dagegen zunächst ein positiver Effekt gefunden.
Sobald jedoch auf die theoretisch relevanten Kapitalkosten kontrolliert wird, finden sich
negative Steuereffekte für beide Beteiligungsmodelle. Dabei zeigt sich, dass eine Erhöhung
der steuerlich relevanten Kapitalkosten die Investitionen bei indirekter Beteiligung deutlich
stärker dämpft als bei einer direkten Beteiligung. Die empirische Analyse berücksichtigt
dabei, dass die Wahl der Investitionsstruktur nicht zufällig erfolgt. Vielmehr kann diese
Entscheidung durch beobachtbare Charakteristika des multinationalen Konzerns beschrieben
werden.
Die empirischen Ergebnisse legen darüber hinaus nahe, dass im Ausland generiertes
Einkommen praktisch ohne steuerliche Belastung zurück zur deutschen Muttergesellschaft
transferiert werden kann. Daraus könnte man folgern, dass indirekte Beteiligungsstrukturen
den Steuerwettbewerb mildern. Allerdings beschränkt sich das Phänomen Steuerwettbewerb
nicht nur auf eine Dimension. In der Tat könnte der Wettbewerb um Zwischen- oder
Holdinggesellschaften gleichzeitig zunehmen.

Taxation
1 Introduction
Economists agree that corporate taxation influences both the location choice and the in-
vestment decision of multinational firms (for a survey, see De Mooij and Ederveen, 2003).
However, as companies become ever more international, another aspect is that multi-
national enterprises also find it increasingly easier to shift profits from high- to low-tax
jurisdictions. Differences in national tax systems and the complexity of the international
tax law open up additional opportunities to avoid taxes. This implies that multinationals
may set up sophisticated firm structures to exploit tax-avoidance opportunities.
In this paper we analyze how taxes affect the affiliate-level investment decision of Ger-
man multinationals, taking into account that a significant share of outbound investments
are indirect rather than direct. While we consider direct investments as simple bilateral
structures (a parent company investing in a foreign affiliate), indirect strategies involve at
least three companies, where the parent is investing via a conduit or intermediate entity
in another foreign enterprise. Indirect investment structures possibly support multina-
tionals in reducing taxable income on a worldwide basis, because profits can be shifted
from high- to low-tax (or even zero-tax) conduit locations. Moreover, tax-efficient indirect

financing structures allow payments to be channeled from affiliates to parent companies,
possibly without any tax deduction. Mintz (2004) shows in a theoretical model that the
analysis of investment decisions made by multinationals should explicitly differ between
direct and indirect investment regimes. In contrast to the existing literature, this paper
follows this structural distinction and empirically confirms that tax effects indeed differ:
while direct investments are negatively affected by the national statutory tax rates, indirect
investments are positively related to statutory tax rates in host countries. If we follow the-
oretical predictions and adjust tax wedges for indirect structures, we find adverse effects on
affiliate-level investment. The potential endogeneity of the structural choice (direct versus
indirect) is taken into account by a switching regression approach.
The empirical investigation is based on the Microdatabase Direct Investment (MiDi),
a comprehensive dataset of all German outbound investment positions provided by the
Deutsche Bundesbank (the German central bank, see Lipponer, 2007). The current version
is available from 1996 to 2005 as panel data. The data provide information on companies'
balance-sheet positions and further characteristics, e.g. whether the investment is held
directly or indirectly.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a general overview of direct and
indirect investment structures, including some descriptive statistics. In Section 3, we set
up a model that distinguishes between direct and indirect investments. Section 4 proposes
an empirical estimation approach. Subsequently, Section 5 provides information about the
data. Section 6 presents the empirical results, and Section 7 examines the sensitivity of
the results. Section 8 is the conclusion.

Indirect

2 Direct versus Indirect Investment Structures
While the majority of foreign investments are direct, a considerable proportion of multina-
tional outbound activities are indirect. Figure 1 shows a stylized model which points out
that multinationals can, in principle, follow both investment regimes. Either the multi-
national decides to invest directly in the destination country (F) or it chooses an indirect
structure and establishes a conduit entity, possibly in a third country (C).1 The choice
of this organizational structure is presumably not random; it may depend on destination-
country characteristics, single firm preferences or strategies, as well as on the company-
specific potential.
Figure 2 presents the annual number of German outbound investments from 1996 to 2005.
There has been a significant increase in the number of investment objects in both regimes.
Moreover, focusing on indirect observations, the left panel of Figure 3 shows the three
1We mostly refer to `conduit' entities. This emphasizes that the firm is in between the German parent
and the foreign subsidiary. Alternatively, we may refer to intermediate or holding companies.

most important conduit locations for German multinationals. The Netherlands attract
more than a fourth of German conduit entities. Together with Switzerland and Austria,
these three countries host almost 60% of all German conduit entities. The right-hand side
of the bottom panel displays the three most important destination countries for indirect
structures. The observations are more evenly distributed across countries, and about one-
fifth of German indirect outbound investment goes to Italy, France, and Spain.2
While this paper argues that differences in international taxation can explain why indi-
rect structures exist at all, the classical case of an indirect entity may be associated with
non-tax reasons. Indeed, headquarters or holding companies may provide services which
it is useful to bundle centrally for legal or efficiency reasons. With regard to taxation,
Weichenrieder and Mintz (2006) identify three potential roles of conduit entities. First, a
conduit entity can be used for so-called treaty shopping, because some countries do offer
preferential treatment with respect to withholding taxes.3 Second, conduit entities in low-
tax countries provide high-tax affiliates with intercompany loans. Borrowing from affiliates
located in low-tax countries and lending to affiliates in high-tax locations will allow the
latter to deduct interest payments from profits and save taxes. Under certain conditions,
this structure even allows for two interest deductions for one investment. Indeed, if an
indirect structure involves two high-tax countries, the multinational can gain twice.4 Fi-
2Note that this descriptive statistic (Figure 3) only considers three-country structures, i.e., structures
where the destination country is different from the conduit country. If observations were included that
allow host and conduit country to be identical, the United States would have been an important host as
well as conduit country, because many US affiliates are held via US holding companies.
3Note that the conduit entity is not necessarily located in a third country. Some countries may provide
special tax treatment for some firms, depending, for instance, on the legal form. The special treatment of
holdings in the Netherlands, financial holdings in Luxembourg, or headquarters of foreign multinationals
in Belgium (co-ordination centers) are well-known examples. Even a holding in the same country is then
possibly tax motivated. Profit and loss consolidation, which is often allowed on a national basis only, can
also explain tax motivated conduit entities where no third country is involved (Weichenrieder and Mintz,
2006).
4This is called a double-dip structure. Some important tax attributes encourage this double-dip situa-
tion in the case of indirect investments (see Mintz, 2004). First, parent country and host country do not
limit interest deduction; second, the parent country exempts conduit income; third, the conduit country
allows for special tax treatment of intermediate companies or is a low-tax country; fourth, the conduit
country (the host country) imposes little or no withholding tax on income paid to the parent (conduit).

Annual number of (in)direct investments over all countries (1996 to 2005). The figure reflects the number of affiliates
in host countries. Direct is defined as direct participation interest in non-holding companies. Indirect as participation
interest held by holding and non-holding companies. While we restrict the sample for below regression analysis on the
producing sector (see Appendix B), we include all observations for descriptive purposes with the exception of minority
holdings, partnerships, and financial services. Source: Deutsche Bundesbank, MiDi.

Indirect three-country structures are the only structures considered, i.e., conduit countries are always different from
host countries. The left panel shows the three most important conduit countries for German indirect outbound
investments (1996-2005). The Netherlands, Switzerland, and Austria account for 56.76% of all observations. The right
side depicts the three most important destination countries for indirect investments (1996-2005). Italy, France, and
Spain account for 21.58% of all observations. Minority holdings, partnerships, and financial services are excluded.

nally, the low-tax conduit can reinvest income and defer any payments to the parent. This
last point is especially relevant for outbound investments from countries using a tax credit
system. However, income deferral of passive income may collide with controlled foreign
company (CFC) rules, depending on the type of income (for further information about
the US Subpart F legislation, see Hines, 1999; Weichenrieder, 1996, for the German rule).
Desai, Foley, and Hines (2003) confirm that tax deferral is an important strategy for US
multinationals, because of the US tax system.5 They show that indirectly owned affiliates
are more sensitive to foreign tax-rate differences, because chains of ownership can mitigate
the effects of the US foreign tax credit system by expanding opportunities to defer US
tax liabilities. Incentives under ownership chains are then comparable to incentives under
exemption systems, because multinationals can avoid repatriation taxes.
3 Theoretical Analysis
Consider a German multinational enterprise. The company is active in Germany (G) and
in a foreign location (F). Production is determined by a concave production function with
standard properties, where fG
(KG
) denotes production in Germany, and fF
(FF
) denotes
production in the foreign country.6 We abstract from other input factors such as labor. The
model follows the analysis of Mintz (2004) and distinguishes two regimes, where regime I
(II) is the direct (indirect) investment regime.
5The US system is called a tax credit system. It taxes companies on their worldwide income, irrespective
of where it was earned. Afterwards, to avoid double taxation, a company receives a credit for the taxes it
paid to a foreign government up to the amount it would have paid had it remained in the US. In contrast,
the method used by Germany and other countries is called a territorial or exemption system. Here, only
profits earned in the home country are taxed.

3.1 Direct Structure (Regime I)
Profits are determined by output, fG
(KG
) and fF
(KF
). Both countries, Germany and
the foreign country, tax profits at rates of G
and F
, respectively. There is no difference
between interest rates in the model. We further assume that foreign-source income is tax
exempt.7 Moreover, we abstract from depreciation allowances and any other taxes (e.g.,
withholding taxes). Overall profits of the multinational (home and foreign profits) are
given by
 = (1 - G
)(fG
(KG
) - iBG
) + iEF
(1)
+ (1 - F
)(fF
(KF
) - iBF
) - iEF
.
The first line captures the profits of the German parent company. BG
refers to external
debt finance. Accordingly, interest expenses iBG
are deductible from the tax base. Note
that we abstract from opportunity costs for own capital iEG
. We may, however, define
profits inclusive of iEG
. The second line refers to the profits of the foreign affiliate. The
affiliate in F can finance with local debt BF
or with parent equity EF
. The parent receives
dividends iEF
without tax deduction. We keep EF
in the model--albeit it would cancel
out in this first case--because it emphasizes one crucial difference compared to the indirect
structure (see below). The firm maximizes profits subject to the following constraints:
KG
+ EF
= BG
,
KF
= EF
+ BF
,
BG
 0, BF
 0.
Note that the first constraint implies that the parent also raises funds to finance the for-
eign affiliate; actually more than necessary for its own investment KG
. We further impose
nonnegativity constraints on BG
and BF
. Another assumption is that the host-country tax

7
rate is always lower than the home-country tax rate (G
> F
). If we maximize the model
with respect to K, taking into account all relevant restrictions, we obtain the following
marginal conditions:
f (KG
) = i,
f (KF
) = i
(1 - G
)
(1 - F
)
.
The first optimality condition points out that the decision of the parent company is not
distorted. Abstracting from i, we refer to the second expression as the tax related cost of
capital or the tax wedge.8 If we assume that the German tax rate always exceeds the foreign
tax rate, new investment is exclusively parent-debt financed.9 The equity transfer to the
affiliate, therefore, is refinanced with external debt. Assuming that the parent's profits
are positive (the parent is not tax-exhaust), overall profits of the multinational enterprise
are maximized. While the optimality condition for the German part of the multinational
implies tax neutrality, the required rate of return for the foreign investment is below i,
because of simple tax arbitrage.
For a variation in the foreign statutory tax rate, we obtain the comparative static effect
which is unambiguously negative: a higher foreign tax rate F
implies higher cost of capital
and less investment
dKF
dF
=
i(1 - G
)
(1 - F
)2f (KF
)
< 0.
8The term tax wedge simply reflects that the optimality condition is distorted, i.e. f (KF
) = i. The
tax wedge in the case of the foreign affiliate implies a reduction of the cost of capital.
9We obtain this extreme result--complete debt finance--because we do not introduce any costs asso-
ciated with debt (and because G
> F
). While these costs are neglected in this model, the corporate
finance literature refers to concepts where debt finance is associated with additional costs (for surveys, see
Myers, 2001; Graham, 2003).
8
3.2 Indirect Structure (Regime II)
We rely on one structural difference when introducing the conduit structure: the parent
company still transfers equity funds to a foreign affiliate, but now to the conduit entity.
Subsequently, the conduit provides the foreign affiliate F with internal debt. The meaning
of the above notation slightly changes: EF
now refers to an internal credit if we consider
the foreign affiliate; it refers to equity if we consider the parent firm. Any further activity
of the conduit is not modeled, because we are only interested in investment activities of
the affiliate F. The multinational's profits are determined by
 = (1 - G
)(fG
(KG
) - iBG
) + iEF
(2)
+ (1 - F
)(fF
(KF
) - iBF
- iEF
).
We assume that transfers, including interest payments to the conduit, can be channeled
from the affiliate to the parent without any tax deduction. The model then describes the
so-called double-dip structure, because the multinational can deduct interest payments in
the host country and in the home country.10 We maximize the model subject to the above
constraints and obtain two expressions for the cost of capital
f (KG
) = i,
f (KF
) = i
(1 - G
- F
)
(1 - F
)
.
The foreign affiliate's cost of capital are further reduced, because of the additional interest
deduction. A variation in the foreign tax rate yields the following positive expression
dKF
dF
=
-iG
(1 - F
)2f (KF
)
> 0.
10Intuitively, the German parent takes up more capital than necessary to finance its own investment.
Interest expenses in Germany are deductible for corporate tax purposes. The foreign affiliate is internal
debt financed, and associated interest expenses are again deductible. Hence we have two interest deductions
for the same investment.
9
The prediction of a positive tax effect is the result of the double-dip interest deduction,
because a higher foreign tax rate implies that interest deductions are even more valuable.
3.3 Indirect Structure (Extended)
We extend the indirect model with respect to one critical assumption. While equation (2)
implies that interest payments received by the conduit are tax exempt, we introduce a tax
C
on interest payments to the conduit. Profits can then be written as
 = (1 - G
)(fG
(KG
) - iBG
) + iEF
(3)
+ (1 - F
)(fF
(KF
) - iBF
- iEF
) - C
iEF
.
C
may denote withholding taxes as well as the conduit-country tax rate. The marginal
decision is then determined by
f (KF
) = i
(1 - G
- (F
- C
))
(1 - F
)
.
There is no longer any tax advantage compared to the direct structure if F
equals C
. If
C
< F
, the tax wedge ranges somewhere between the direct and the indirect solution.
To sum up, theory suggests two different regimes with two (three) different measures for
the tax related cost of capital. Hence, tax wedges T for respective regimes follow:
T1
=
(1 - G
)
(1 - F
)
, (4)
T2
=
(1 - G
- F
)
(1 - F
)
, (5)
T
2
=
(1 - G
- F
+ C
)
(1 - F
)
. (6)
10
T1
applies to the direct structure (Regime I), T2
is the relevant tax measure for the indirect
structure (Regime II), and T
2
relates to the extended indirect structure, where C
is also
considered.
4 Investigation Approach
The purpose of the empirical analysis is to estimate affiliate-level investment. The theoret-
ical analysis suggests two different regimes, depending on whether investments are direct or
indirect. One way to approach this problem is to consider direct and indirect investments
as two separate samples, simply split observations, and estimate two distinct equations.
However, firms do not randomly choose one or the other regime, and a simple split does
not fully account for this endogeneity.11
To address this endogeneity problem we follow the literature and estimate an endogenous
switching regression model, where the switching rule is observed (Lee, 1978). Maddala
(1983) suggests a two-step procedure: first, estimate the binary variable I, indicating
whether the investment is directly or indirectly held. Subsequently, estimate affiliate in-
vestment in a second stage and condition on the regime choice.
From a taxation perspective, conduit structures should generally be dominant, empirically.
11We can think of endogeneity in this context in many different ways. First, there are some firms switch-
ing from one regime to the other. The ultimate regression sample contains exactly 50 affiliates switching
at least once over the whole time span. Firms switching and immediately switching back, however, do
not contribute new information if they come up as single observations in the panel data regressions with
affiliate-specific effects. Second, firms' potentials to cushion shocks differ, depending on the regime. Hence,
the regime is correlated with these shocks. Third, the variable of interest, affiliate investment, may also
differ structurally with respect to all control variables. Fourth, regime choice and investment level may be
simultaneously determined.
Another intuitive way to think about endogeneity is to look at the decision to set up an indirect structure.
The existence of preferential tax treatments, or generally differences in international taxation, presumably
distort the decision to set up a conduit structure. If the heterogeneity in multinationals' potentials ulti-
mately determines the regime, we have a problem of self selection, or selection into the regime.
Any fixed-effects approach may account for time-invariant preferences (e.g., Vella, 1998). Yet the proclivity
of multinationals to choose a specific regime can vary over time.
11
However, descriptive statistics show that the majority of investments are direct. It is cer-
tainly true that indirect structures can be efficient, but they are also costly. While every
foreign activity is associated with costs (e.g., Markusen, 1995), a conduit entity involves
additional control and information problems, and hence, additional costs which reduce the
probability to choose the indirect structure. We summarize the decision to establish a
conduit entity with the following equations
Iijkt
=





1 if IND
ijkt
> 0,
0 otherwise.
IND
ijkt
= f[cijkt
(Xijkt
, i
)].
Iijkt
is a binary variable indicating whether the multinational j is investing in country
k at time t in an affiliate i via a conduit entity or not. IND
ijkt
is the corresponding
unobserved propensity and cijkt
represents the company-specific costs associated with the
conduit firm. These costs are determined by affiliate and company-group variables and
also by host-location factors, e.g. the host-country tax rate kt
. Hence, a vector Xijkt
of observable host-country characteristics as well as affiliate- and company-group-specific
characteristics determines costs. Finally, i
captures unobserved preferences of affiliates,
which may be important, for instance, because of affiliate-specific management strategies.
First-step estimation equations are then specified as
Iijkt
= a1
BSTjt
+ a2
PROjt
+ a4
Xijkt
+ t

ijkt
. (7)
The respective regime choice is determined by the company-group specific variables BSTjt
and PROjt
, which reflect the group-specific ability, and also preference, as regards es-
tablishing a conduit entity. BSTjt
is the balance-sheet total of the multinational group;
PROjt
refers to the profitability of the multinational.12 Moreover, all relevant second-

, as additional regressors (Maddala, 1983).13 Finally, T1
and T2
are the
tax-related cost of capital for direct and indirect structures as defined in (4) and (5),
respectively.
The empirical implementation of this two-step approach in context of panel data and
unobserved heterogeneity in both equations requires further considerations. We follow the
procedure suggested by Wooldridge (1995) for panel data selection models.14
fication requires at least one variable that explains the regime choice. We may refer to this variable as an
instrument. The nonlinearity of the probability model can already be sufficient to identify the regime. Yet
this can cause collinearity among regressors since we condition on the regime choice in the second stage
(Wooldridge, 2002). Note also that we do not aim to explain which countries are preferable conduit-entity
locations. Rather, we are interested in the multinational's regime choice, i.e., the first-stage decision to
establish a conduit structure at all, where the company can choose any potential conduit location.

5 Data and Descriptive Statistics
For the empirical analysis, we use the Microdatabase Direct Investment (MiDi) provided
by the Deutsche Bundesbank. This is an affiliate-level database of German multinationals'
foreign investments. The data provide information about the investment object's balance
sheet, including further information on the type of investment and on the investor. A fa-
vorable aspect of the data is that the current version provides affiliate-level panel data for
the period 1996 to 2005. Moreover, data collection is enforced by German law, which sets
reporting obligations for certain international transactions and positions.15 As a crucial
variable for this analysis, MiDi includes the information on whether the German multina-
tional invests directly or indirectly via a conduit entity.
Below regressions analyze the determinants of affiliate-level investment. Investment is
defined as the logarithmic difference in the balance-sheet item `fixed assets'. While we
can also interpret this variable as a growth rate, we mostly refer to `investment' in the
following. Explanatory variables are tax wedges T as defined above. This variable is
expected to be negatively related to affiliate-level investment. In order to control for
country characteristics, we employ the local GDP, local labor cost in manufacturing, and
the local lending rate.16 Furthermore, we control for the present value of depreciation
allowances defined by the countries' tax code. Besides, we condition on the affiliate-specific
variables sales and loss carryforward. We expect a positive sign for sales, because this is
an indicator for the affiliate's size and cash flow. The dummy variable loss carryforward
indicates whether some loss carryforward is reported. The existence of losses in the previous
periods may capture characteristics of the current decision problem of the company such
15Aussenwirtschaftsgesetz (Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation) in connection with Aussen-
wirtschaftsverordnung (Foreign Trade and Payment Regulations). Each German multinational has to
report its foreign assets including both direct and indirect FDI, conditional on some lower threshold level
for mandatory reporting. Since 2002, investments have to be reported if the participation is 10% or more
and the balance-sheet total of the foreign object is above 3 million euros. Though previous years showed
lower thresholds, this level is uniformly applied for all years in the panel. For details see Lipponer (2007).
16MiDi does not provide information on affiliate-specific labor costs, or interest payments, etc.
14
as the expected performance of an affiliate. Loss carryforward is expected to be negatively
related to investment.
Table 1 summarizes all relevant regression variables and respective mean values. The esti-
mation sample is restricted to majority holdings. Moreover, financial services, partnerships,
and nonproductive observations are excluded (see the Appendix for a detailed classifica-
tion). According to theory, we remove observations if the German tax rate is below the
statutory tax rate of the destination country.17 Tax wedges are defined according to equa-
tions (4), (5), and (6). Since withholding taxes are often negotiated in double tax treaties,
the withholding tax rate C
depends on the location of the conduit entity and potential
treaties of host countries with conduit countries.18 To check the sensitivity of the analysis,
we further define T
2a
, T
2b
, and T
2c
, where we set C
at 10%, 20%, and 25%, respectively,
for all observations (see also Section 7). The consideration for this is that we change the
composition of the sample, because the maximization problem in Section 3.3 requires that
C
is below the host-country tax rate. If this condition is not fulfilled, the observation
is removed. Additionally, we change the variation of the nonlinear tax wedge. Whereas
tax wedges differ by construction, a comparison of other variables' mean values already
indicate structural differences. As we would expect, the mean statutory tax rate is higher
in Regime II. Market size, reflected by GDP, is on average twice as high in Regime II.
Moreover, investments are much bigger in the case of the indirect structures--in terms of
fixed assets and also in terms of sales. Another aspect is that labor costs differ on average.
One may speculate whether this indicates that direct investments are also predominantly
vertical FDI.
17The relevant German statutory tax rate is adjusted for the non-deductibility of interest expenses,
because this is the relevant measure for this basic arbitrage condition.
18Withholding tax rates on interest payments refer to 2005.

6 Regression Analysis
First regression results, where we simply split the sample and estimate the respective
regimes, are reported in Table 2. As expected, we find a negative impact of the statutory
tax rate and of the tax wedge on direct investments. While we partially confirm theory by
finding a positive, but not significant, tax rate effect on indirect investments, we confirm the
negative effect of the tax wedge as defined in equation (5) (column (4)). We additionally
include control variables such as the affiliate-specific sales, or the dummy variable for
the loss carryforward. Both affiliate-specific variables show the expected sign, and the
negative loss carryforward is also significant. The fixed effects approach removes all cross-
section variation between affiliates and also nests country fixed effects. In this sense, it
is not surprising that country-specific variables, for example local GDP or labor cost,
are statistically insignificant. We find, however, a significant positive effect of the local
lending rate for some specifications. The positive coefficient may reflect the comparative
advantage of multinationals compared to domestic firms, because multinationals can rely on
internal capital markets. According to the model in Section 3, external lending conditions
in Germany are relevant. We control for the variation of German lending conditions by
including a full set of time dummies. Thereby, we also capture general taxing conditions
in Germany which are the same for all German parent firms.
Since we condition on affiliate-specific effects in this sample split, estimates are consistent
if sample selection--the choice of the regime--depends on the constant affiliate-specific
component (e.g., Vella, 1998). If this affiliate-specific effect does not fully capture selection,
or if the selection effect varies over time, our estimates are not consistent. Table 3 reports
the results from switching regressions, where we additionally condition on the selection
effect ^
.19 Basically, the results confirm findings in Table 2. The positive tax rate effect for

respect to the inclusion of regime-identifying variables. However, all regressions in Table 3 use specification

equation (6), where C
corresponds to the bilateral withholding tax for interest payments
between the host country and the conduit country. The insignificant coefficient in column
(5) may indicate that multinationals can avoid withholding taxes, for example, by using
sophisticated conduit chains, or by benefiting from favorable tax treatment.

Table 4 summarizes the estimated selection effects (specifications refer to columns (1) and
(2) of Table 3). A test on the joint significance of the 9 selection terms confirms a bias for
both samples. There is no well-defined expectation about the sign of the selection variables.
Selection can basically depend on the general economic environment, for example cyclical
fluctuations, and how multinationals are able to cope with it; and this can vary over time.
We estimate a significant positive effect for most years of the direct sample. This is,
intuitively, what we would expect: a higher probability to invest directly implies less new
investment. Yet the findings for the indirect sample are ambiguous.

7 Sensitivity Analysis
Finally, we test the robustness of the regression analysis. Table 5 shows estimations for
both regimes. Columns (1) and (4) refer to 27 European Union (EU) member countries.
Columns (2) and (5) refer to the EU 15. The reason for this sample restriction is that we
possibly cannot capture relevant withholding tax rates, because conduit chains are complex
and income is channeled through different conduit countries. Moreover, there is preferential
tax treatment for some firms in many countries. Preferential tax treatment depends, for
instance, on the legal form of the affiliate. If we restrict countries on the European Union,
however, we can test the robustness of the findings, because the EU parent-subsidiary
directive, the EU interest and royalties directive, and existing double-tax treaties often
rule out withholding taxes. All results from above regressions are confirmed in Table 5.
In a next step, we only analyze affiliates from the manufacturing sector (columns (3) and
(6)). Findings are also robust with respect to this sample restriction. Finally, columns (7),
(8), and (9) employ tax wedges, where the tax rate C
equals 10%, 20%, and 25%, for all
observations. This changes the variation of the nonlinear tax term, and imposes a further
restriction on the sample. Accordingly, all observations are removed where the host tax
rate is above 10%, 20%, or 25% (the maximization problem in Section 3.3 requires that the
host-country tax rate is higher than taxation in the conduit country). All findings confirm
the negative tax wedge effect, but the last specification is no longer significant.
8 Conclusions
This paper has investigated the affiliate-level investment decision of German multination-
als. A theoretical model yields different corporate tax effects, depending on whether the
multinational follows a direct or an indirect investment strategy. According to theory, we
estimate a switching regression model with observed switching for two structurally differ-

Dependent variable is investment, defined as the logarithmic difference in the balance-sheet position fixed assets. Time dummies and linearized affiliate-level fixed effects
are included but not reported. All estimations take into account the endogeneity of the regime choice. Standard errors (in parentheses) are robust for any form of
heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation, and account for the two-step estimation (Wooldridge, 1995). (***) (**) (*) indicate significance at the (1%) (5%) (10%) level. All

ent regimes. This approach allows us to control for the endogeneity of the regime choice.
The empirical results confirm theoretical predictions: corporate tax effects are negative for
direct investments, but positive for indirect observations. Tax related costs of capital are
confirmed to be negatively related to investment in both regimes. In particular, according
to specifications (3) and (4) in Table 3, we find a semi-elasticity of -.38 for direct and -.99
for indirect investments.
The empirical analysis supports the hypothesis that income can be transferred to the
German parent without any tax deduction. This may be reasonable, given that many
conditions promoting the double-dip structure are fulfilled. First, Germany is a high-tax
country (in the empirical analysis we drop all observations where the German tax rate is
below the tax rate of the foreign affiliate). Second, Germany exempts dividend income
almost completely. Third, the major conduit countries (see Section 2) are well-known
conduit locations, often with preferential tax regimes.20 Fourth, real conduit structures
can be more complicated. Indeed, indirect structures often involve not only one conduit
entity, but complex multi-country ownership chains. This opens up extensive financing
opportunities and opportunities to repatriate profits untaxed (treaty shopping).
One remarkable aspect of the findings is the implication for tax competition: the existence
of conduit structures and low-tax conduit countries reduces the downward pressure on tax
rates. One may speculate whether this explains why some countries can stick to higher
taxes. We should, however, interpret this conclusion with considerable caution, because
tax competition is a phenomenon which is not confined to one specific aspect. In fact, tax
competition for conduit entities may well be intensified.
20Special tax regimes often apply to holding companies (e.g., in Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland,
UK). In some cases, tax rates are even negotiable. Tax authorities and single firms agree on special
arrangements for certain time periods, which have to be renegotiated afterwards.

Appendix A: Selection Correction for Panel Data Mod-
els under Conditional Mean Independence Assumption
Wooldridge (1995) suggests a flexible two-stage regression approach to correct for sample
selection bias in panel data models. We apply his estimation strategy on the above switch-
ing regression model, which allows us to perform robust statistical inference. Appendix
A summarizes the main points of the estimator, with an emphasis on standard error cor-
rection. For details and consistency proofs, please consult the Wooldridge (1995) paper.
The estimator allows for arbitrary correlation between the unobserved effects (i
, i
) and
observable explanatory variables.21 Furthermore, the error distribution in the second-stage
equation remains unspecified; the idiosyncratic errors can be arbitrarily serially dependent
and can have any form of heterogeneity.
We proceed with a version of the above switching regression model, where we slightly
change notations for simplicity and stick closer to Wooldridge (1995). We start the analysis
by first estimating a probit model
P(Iit
= 1|xi
) = (xi
t
). (8)
Equation (8) is estimated by standard probit techniques,22 however for each time period.
Subsequently, we obtain estimates for the selection terms, ^
1,i
= (xi
^
t
)/(xi
^
t
) and ^
2,i
=
(xi
^
t
)/(1 - (xi
^
t
)), which are then included as control variables in the second-stage
regressions (Maddala, 1983).
Regime 1: y1,it
= 1
^
w1,it
+ u1,it
iff I = 1. (9)
21An important part of the variation in y is explained by unobserved heterogeneity between firms. This
unobserved effect is likely to be correlated with other control variables. Hence, consistent coefficients
require a fixed effects approach.
22(x) is a vector of control variables, including all second-stage regressors and also some additional
regime-identifying variables.
24
Regime 2: y2,it

Here, ^
w is defined as ^
wR,it
= (1, xR,it
, xi
, 0, ..., 0, ^
R,it
, 0, ..., 0), for R = 1,2. Note that we
additionally include the estimated probability terms ^
R
(R = 1, 2) from first-stage regres-
sions and also firm-specific means to control for unobserved heterogeneity.23 Subsequently,
we obtain the coefficient vector R
(R = 1, 2) from a pooled OLS regression:

Appendix B: First-Stage Regression Results
The empirical analysis follows Maddala (1983), who suggests a two-stage method for es-
timating the switching regression model. The first-stage regression is concerned with the
estimation of a probit model, where group-specific variables can identify the respective
regime. The results for pooled probit regressions are reported in Table 6.24 All coefficients
are in line with theoretical considerations. A higher balance-sheet total of the whole com-
pany group is associated with a higher probability of setting up an indirect structure. We
may speculate whether these companies have the required expertise to do so. The procliv-

ity to think in terms of tax planning may also be higher considering big multinationals. All
regression results in Tables 3 to 5 are reported according to specification (2), where another
identifying variable is included.25 The findings indicate that a higher profitability of the
company group is associated with a higher propensity to invest indirectly.26 We argue that
both the balance-sheet total and the profitability on the multinational-group level are valid
identifying variables. While the second-stage regressions consider affiliate-level variation,
where we also control for affiliate-specific heterogeneity, the balance-sheet total and the
profitability vary at the group level. If we were considering variation between countries--
we actually remove it by conditioning on affiliate-specific heterogeneity--we would also
expect the local tax rate to be a crucial determinant.
To sum up, the estimations suggests that, after conditioning on affiliate-specific hetero-
geneity, company-specific variables are the only relevant factors affecting the choice of the
regime.
25Specification tests indicate that results are robust, irrespective of whether specification (1) or (2) is
used.
26Profitability is defined as total profits of the multinational (after taxes, prior to profit distribution,
and offsetting of losses carried forward), relative to the balance-sheet total of the group.

.
Tax rates account for the non-deductibility of interest expenses with
respect to the German local business tax.
Minority holdings and partnerships are excluded, as well as the following
non-producing sectors: education, health, veterinary and social care,
financial services, holding companies, other services, recreational,
cultural and sporting activities, retail and wholesale trade, real
estate and renting, research and development, telecommunication
and post, private households with employees activities of other
membership organizations, nonprofit organizations serving households,
general government, sewage and refuse disposal, compulsory social
security, agriculture, hunting and forestry (see Lipponer, 2007).
Note that restrictions do not apply on Fig. 2 and 3.

trage condition then requires that host-country tax
rates are higher than 10%
