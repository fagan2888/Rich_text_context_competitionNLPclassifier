Abstract
Sutherlandia (Sutherlandia frutescens) and elderberry (Sambucus spp.) are used to promote health and for treatment of a
number of ailments. Although studies with cultured cells have demonstrated antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties
of these botanicals, little is known about their ability to mitigate brain injury. In this study, C57BL/6 J male mice were fed
AIN93G diets without or with Sutherlandia or American elderberry for 2 months prior to a 30-min global cerebral ischemia
induced by occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries (BCCAs), followed by reperfusion for 3 days. Accelerating
rotarod assessment at 24 h after BCCA occlusion showed amelioration of sensorimotor impairment in the mice fed the
supplemented diets as compared with the ischemic mice fed the control diet. Quantitative digital pathology assessment of
brain slides stained with cresyl violet at 3 days after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) revealed significant reduction in neuronal cell
death in both dietary groups. Immunohistochemical staining for ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 demonstrated
pronounced activation of microglia in the hippocampus and striatum in the ischemic brains 3 days after I/R, and microglial
activation was significantly reduced in animals fed supplemented diets. Mitigation of microglial activation by the supplements
was further supported by the decrease in expression of p47phox, a cytosolic subunit of NADPH oxidase, and phospho-
ERK1/2, a mitogen-activated protein kinase known to mediate a number of cytoplasmic processes including oxidative stress
and neuroinflammatory responses. These results demonstrate neuroprotective effect of Sutherlandia and American elder-
berry botanicals against oxidative and inflammatory responses to cerebral I/R.

Introduction
Throughout human history, many natural products from
plants have been suggested to promote human health and
manage disease symptoms, and some have been devel-
oped into modern-day drugs. Studies in recent years
have documented antioxidative and anti-inflammatory
properties of fruits and vegetables and herbs and indicate
that some of these can maintain brain health during aging
(Galli et al., 2002; Sun et al., 2008). It is important to
understand the molecular mechanisms underlying their
mode of action.
Sutherlandia (Sutherlandia frutescens [L.] R. Brown or
Lessertia frutescens [L.] Goldblatt & J.C. Manning), also
known colloquially as cancer bush, is widely used in
southern African traditional and contemporary remedies
for a variety of chronic ailments, including cancer, arth-
ritis, digestive disorders, and diabetes, and more recently,
behavioral symptoms of HIV/AIDS such as depression
and anxiety (Mills et al., 2005; van Wyk and Albrecht,
2008). Studies with cell and animal models have demon-
strated its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties
(Fernandes et al., 2004; Ojewole, 2004; Katerere and
Eloff, 2005; Kundu et al., 2005; Faleschini et al., 2013;
Jiang et al., 2014). Although some evidence supports
Sutherlandia's benefit for mitigating stress (Prevoo
et al., 2004) as well as drug-induced seizures (Ojewole,
2008), little is known about its broader effects against
neurodegenerative diseases and stroke. Results from a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in
healthy adults of consumption of Sutherlandia for
3 months showed it was well tolerated (Johnson
et al., 2007).
Consumption of elderberry including the North
American subspecies (Sambucus nigra L. subsp. canaden-
sis [L.] Bolli) has increased in recent years, mainly for its
claimed ability to combat symptoms of common flu and
other viral infections (Zakay-Rones et al., 1995;
``Sambucus nigra (elderberry),'' 2005; Vlachojannis
et al., 2010). Elderberries are widely cultivated in
Europe, Asia, North Africa, and North America
(``Sambucus nigra (elderberry),'' 2005). Elderberry fruit
contains flavonoids and anthocyanins (Lee and Finn,
2007; Thomas et al., 2013), which are reported to have
beneficial effects of human health, especially cardiovascu-
lar functions and anticarcinogenic, antiviral, and anti-
inflammatory effects (Prior and Wu, 2006; Zafra-Stone
et al., 2007). Cyanidin-3-glucoside, one of the most
common anthocyanins of berries, was shown to amelior-
ate ethanol-induced neurotoxicity in developing brains
and protect against focal cerebral ischemia in mice (Ke
et al., 2011; Min et al., 2011). There is further evidence
suggesting the ability of berries to prevent age-associated
oxidative stress and to improve neuronal and cognitive
functions in animal models (Galli et al., 2002). Despite
the increasing interest regarding these secondary
metabolites, little is known whether elderberries alleviate
stroke damage.
Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide
and is the primary cause of acquired disability in the
United States (Davis and Donnan, 2012). Although the
pathophysiology of ischemic damage is complex, exten-
sive studies have focused on the underlying mechanisms
of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses following
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R; Chen et al., 2011a, 2011b).
Studies have demonstrated the role of NADPH oxidase
and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathways in production of reactive oxygen spe-
cies (ROS) and signaling events leading to mitochondrial
dysfunction and activation of apoptotic pathways (Chen
et al., 2011a; Yoshioka et al., 2011a). Among the various
in vivo models of cerebral ischemia, the murine bilateral
common carotid artery (BCCA) occlusion model has
been documented to cause damage in the hippocampal
and striatal neurons (Lin et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2005b;
Yoshioka et al., 2011a). Previous studies with the gerbil
global BCCA occlusion model demonstrated protective
effects of botanicals such as curcumin and grape polyphe-
nol extracts against neuronal cell death and glial cell acti-
vation in the hippocampal CA1 area (Wang et al., 2002;
Simonyi et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005b).
Both Sutherlandia and elderberry share the capacity to
relieve oxidative stress and suppress inflammatory
responses. In this study, the murine global cerebral ische-
mia model was used to demonstrate that dietary supple-
mentation by Sutherlandia and American elderberry offer
protection against ischemia-induced neuronal damage and
glial cell activation and neurobehavioral dysfunctions.

Animals, Diets, and Ischemia Protocol
Adult male C57Bl/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar
Harbor, ME) at age 8 weeks were housed 4/cage and
maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at
7:00 a.m.) with unrestricted access to food and water.
Prior to surgical BCCA occlusion, mice were fed for 2
months with a nutritionally complete experimental diet
AIN93G with or without supplement of either 1% by
weight of freeze-dried, ground Sutherlandia-dried vegeta-
tive material or 2% by weight of freeze-dried, ground
whole ripe fruit of American elderberry, based on empir-
ical estimates of mouse equivalents of human consump-
tion (Wang et al., 2005c; Johnson et al., 2007; see Table 1
for complete composition of the control and test diets).
Sutherlandia vegetative material was purchased from Big
Tree Nutraceutical (Fish Hoek, South Africa) and stored
at Ã20C in an air-tight container in the dark. The elder-
berry fruits were harvested in 2010 from a germplasm
repository in southwest Missouri (United States) and
frozen in zippered plastic freezer bags. Berries were
later de-stemmed and cleaned, lyophilized, and ground
into fine powder before addition to diets. A mixture of
several American elderberry genotypes was used in this
study. Botanical vouchers confirming the taxonomic
identity of plants were deposited into the herbaria of
the University of Missouri or the Missouri Botanical
Garden (St. Louis, MO). Average food intake was
2.6 Ã 0.05 g/day/mouse; and average diet consumption
was 0.106 Ã 0.003 g/gram body weight/day. Weekly
monitoring of body weight indicated no differences in
weight between any of the groups at any time during
the course of the study. Approved animal protocols
were obtained, and all treatment steps were in accordance
with University of Missouri and the National Institutes
of Health guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
For the study, mice were divided into four experimen-
tal groups: (a) sham animals with AIN93G control diet
(Sham/CD, n Â¼ 7), (b) BCCA occlusion-induced ischemia
with AIN93G diet (Isch/CD, n Â¼ 7), (c) BCCA occlusion-
induced ischemia with AIN93G diet containing 1%
Sutherlandia (Isch/SD, n Â¼ 7), and (d) BCCA occlusion-
induced ischemia with AIN93G diet containing 2% elder-
berry (Isch/ED, n Â¼ 7). To conserve on animal numbers,
sham operation was performed only on animals with the
control diet. Animals were subjected to a transient global
cerebral ischemia by BCCA occlusion as described previ-
ously with minor modifications (Lin et al., 2000; Chen
et al., 2011a). To initiate the surgical protocol, mice
were placed in a holding chamber and anesthetized with
4% isoflurane, and continuous anesthesia during surgery
was maintained with 1% to 1.5% isoflurane in 70%
nitrogen and 30% oxygen with a face mask. During the
surgery, rectal temperature was monitored and main-
tained at 37 Ã 0.5C with a thermostat-controlled heating
pad. BCCA occlusion was accomplished by applying
microaneurysm clips on both common carotid arteries

reperfusion. Reestablishment of blood flow was con-
firmed by direct observation. Sham operation animals
were subjected to the identical surgical procedures
except for application of micro-aneurysm clips. After sur-
gery, animals were placed in cages above a heating blan-
ket to maintain rectal temperatures above 36C for 1Â­2 h
with active monitoring.
Assessment of Sensorimotor Functions
Assessment of sensorimotor functions was carried out by
the rotarod test as described previously with modifica-
tions (Simonyi et al., 2012). Two days prior to BCCA
occlusion, mice were trained on the rotarod (Med
Associates, St. Albans, VT) in the acceleration paradigm
(4Â­40 rpm/5 min) for three trials each day with a 30-min
intertrial interval (see Figure 1(a) for the experimental
design with BCCA occlusion set as Day 0). Latency is
defined as the time spent on the accelerating rotating
rotarod without falling off or gripping and spinning
rather than walking. Preoperative baseline values were
obtained by determining average of the three best
performances. Postoperative testing (three trials) were
performed 24 h after I/R, and the means were used for
calculation of rotarod performance. Latencies measured
at 24 h after I/R were expressed as % of performances
reached before surgery.
Brain Tissue Processing, Histochemical Staining, and
Assessment of Neuronal Damage
Three days after I/R, mice were euthanized with isoflur-
ane and brains were sectioned for histochemical staining
and assessment of neuronal damage using a well-
established protocol as described previously (Cui et al.,
2012; Hadass et al., 2013). Briefly, mice were transcar-
dially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100-mM
phosphate buffer, and brains were dissected and pre-
served for 24 h in the same buffer. Serial coronal sections
(40 mm) were obtained with a vibrotome (VT1200S, Leica
Microsystems, Inc., Bannockbum, IL). In most instances,
a total of 150 to 160 40-mm tissue sections from each
brain were collected into 24-well plates. Serial brain sec-
tions 200-mm apart were mounted on poly-L-lysine-
coated glass slides and followed by staining with cresyl

Rotarod performance is expressed as percent of time the mouse can stay on the accelerating rotarod compared with pre-ischemia as the
baseline values. Four groups of mice were divided into (i) AIN93G control diet (Sham/CD), (ii) BCCA occlusion-induced ischemia with
control diet (Isch/CD), (iii) BCCA occlusion-induced ischemia Ã¾ Sutherlandia diet (Isch/SD), and (iv) BCCA occlusion-induced ische-
mia Ã¾ elderberry diet (Isch/ED). Data are expressed as mean Ã SEM (n Â¼ 7 for all groups). Statistical significance is denoted with

death.
Pathological assessment of histological specimens was
carried out in an unbiased manner using a high-through-
put digital pathology system. Briefly, whole slide images
(WSI) of the cresyl violet-stained brain sections were
obtained using an automatic multifocus plane, high-
throughput digital pathology system (Aperio ScanScope
CS digital scanner, Vista, CA). Extent of neuronal
damage in the brain sections were analyzed in a double-
blind manner using the following criteria for the grading
scale: 0: no observable neuronal damage; 1: damaged neu-
rons populate 0% to 25% of area; 2: damaged neurons
populate 25% to 50% of area; 3: damaged neurons popu-
late 50% to 75% of area; and 4: damaged neurons popu-
late >75% of area (Cui et al., 2012; Hadass et al., 2013).
Fluorescence Immunohistochemistry
Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was carried out on
brain sections for astrocytes (with GFAP) and microglia
(with Iba-1 and CD11b; Hadass et al., 2013), as well as
p47phox and phospho-ERK1/2. Briefly, fixed coronal
sections from the area of interest were washed with phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilized with 1%
Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Sections were incubated
with Pro-Block (PBK125; ScyTek, Logan, UT) for 5 min
to eliminate the need to match species with the fluores-
cence conjugated antibody, followed by 10% normal goat
serum in 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 60 min, and then
overnight with 0.5% normal goat serum in 0.05% Triton
X-100 in PBS containing the primary antibodies (GFAP,
1:500; CD11b, 1:400; Iba-1, 1:1000; p47phox, 1:400; and
phospho-ERK 1:500). The next day, sections were
washed and incubated in 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS
containing the appropriate fluorophore-conjugated sec-
ondary antibodies (1:300; goat anti-mouse IgG-
Alexa488, goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa594, and goat
anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa488, goat anti-rat IgG Alexa594;
Life Technologies/Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for 2 h
and counterstained in a solution of Hoechst dye 33342
(1:1000; H-3570, Life Technologies/Invitrogen, San
Diego, CA). Fluorescence photomicrographs of the
areas of interest were captured by a Leica DMI 6000B
automated epifluorescence microscope (Leica
Microsystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL), and the high mag-
nification photomicrographs were processed using the
AF6000 stitching program and intensity analysis with
the ImageJ program. For quantification of immunofluor-
escence intensity, five representative areas in the striatum
(coordinated approximately to Bregma 0.78 mm) were
selected bilaterally (as indicated in the Figure 4(a)), and
the microphotographic images of the immunostained
brain sections were captured. All microphotographic
images for examining each set of the experimental
groups were taken under the same camera and micro-
scope settings including the dimension, voxel size, and
exposure parameters (intensity, exposure time and gain
for each channel, as well as threshold values for black as
0, white as 255, and binning 1 Ã 1), except pERK which
has threshold values from 99 to 255.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean Ã standard error of the mean
(SEM). Results were analyzed by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni's posttest (V4.00;
GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA).
Statistical significance was considered for p < .05.

Dietary Supplementation With Sutherlandia or
Elderberry Ameliorated Motor Impairment in Mice
After Transient Global Cerebral Ischemia
A time line of the experimental protocol, showing feeding
of mice at 2 months of age, presurgery and postsurgery
rotarod tests, and sacrifice for brain pathology is shown
in Figure 1(a). In this experiment, sensorimotor functions
in the sham, ischemia, and ischemia with Sutherlandia
and elderberry diet groups were assessed using the accel-
erating rotarod paradigm. In the pre-ischemia rotarod
tests, no differences were observed in sensorimotor func-
tions between controls and the different dietary groups
(Sham/CD, 254.0 Ã¾ 5.9 s; Isch/CD, 245.6 Ã¾ 10.7 s;
Isch/SD, 247.0 Ã¾ 12.5 s; Isch/ED, 275.7 Ã¾ 6.2 s; p > .05,
one-way ANOVA). Rotarod performance was unchanged
in the sham-operated group but was significantly impaired
in the ischemia group assessed 24 h after reperfusion
(Figure 1(b)). Consumption of the Sutherlandia or elder-
berry supplemented diets for 2 months ameliorated the
sensorimotor deficits by prolonging rotarod latencies.
Consumption of Sutherlandia and Elderberry Diets
Decreased Neuronal Damage After I/R
Cresyl violet staining of brain sections revealed substan-
tial damage in neuronal morphology after BCCA occlu-
sion (Figure 2(a)): While normal healthy neurons were
round with pale-stained cytoplasm, many neurons in
the ischemic regions in cortex, hippocampus, and stri-
atum were angular in shape with condensed cell bodies
(see higher magnification insets in Figures 2(b), (d), and
(f), respectively). The zoomable WSI photomicrographs
were acquired from approximately 30 to 35 serial tissue
sections with 200-mm interval per brain. Damage scoring

striatum including thalamus and basal ganglia areas were
carried out in a double-blind manner using the web-based
ImageScope program. Quantitation of the cellular
damage in each region revealed that I/R resulted in
severe neuronal damage in the hippocampal but those
in the striatum/thalamus/basal ganglia area and the cor-
tical regions were also damaged albeit to a lesser extent
(Figure 2(b) and (c)). Dietary supplementation with elder-
berry significantly decreased the neuronal damage in all
the brain regions examined (Figure 2(c), (e), and (g)). To
a lesser extent, decrease in neuronal damage was also
observed in these brain regions on supplementation
with Sutherlandia.
Immunostaining of Microglial Cells and Astrocytes
Neuronal damage after I/R is often accompanied with
increased neuroinflammatory responses including astro-
gliosis and microglial activation (Wang et al., 2006;
Brennan et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2011b). We assessed
these responses 3 days after I/R by immunostaining
brain sections with Iba-1 for microglia and GFAP for
astrocytes. Immunofluorescent analysis with Iba-1
revealed low immunoreactivity in sham controls but a
robust and widespread increase in the ischemic brain,
especially in the hippocampal and striatal regions
(Figure 3(a), Isch/CD). Both Sutherlandia and elder-
berry diets attenuated the Iba-1 immunoreactivity in
the cortex and striatum (Figure 3(a), Isch/SD and
Isch/ED).
We also examined brain sections immunostained with
GFAP as a marker for activated astrocytes.
Immunoreactivity of GFAP was low in sham controls
but increased after I/R. The pattern for GFAP immunor-
eactivity appeared to be more spread out and diffuse as
compared with those stained with Iba-1 immunoreactiv-
ity (Figure 3(b)).
Sutherlandia and Elderberry Consumption
Attenuated I/R-Induced Activation of Microglia but
Not Astrocytes in the Striatum
Because the striatal region is more homogeneous, we
selected five representative subregions for further exam-
ine cell immunoreactivity and morphology (Figure 4(a)).
Immunoreactivity of Iba-1 expressing microglial cells in
the sham-operated group appeared mostly in the resting
ramified form with small round cell bodies and thin pro-
cesses (Figure 4(b)), whereas those in the ischemic regions
became amoeboid shape with irregular cell bodies and
thick processes (see insets in Figure 4(b)). By assessing
average fluorescence intensity of Iba-1 in these striatal
regions, significantly lower immunoreactivity of microglia
in mice fed the Sutherlandia or elderberry diets as com-
pared with the ischemia group on the control diet
(Figure 4(c)).
Similarly, fluorescence intensity of GFAP in the
striatal regions indicated a significant increase in
GFAP immunoreactivity after BCCA occlusion as
compared with sham controls (Figure 4(d)).
However, both Sutherlandia and elderberry diets did
not attenuate GFAP immunoreactivity as compared
with the ischemia group on the control diet
(Figure 6(d)).

Sutherlandia and Elderberry Consumption Inhibited
I/R-Induced Increases in p47Phox Expression in the
Striatum
A number of studies have demonstrated involvement of
NADPH oxidase in ROS production during I/R (Wang
et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2009). Double immunostaining of
p47phox, an NADPH oxidase subunit, with GFAP for
astrocytes and CD11b for microglial cells showed that
p47phox immunoreactivity did not colocalize with the
GFAP expressing astrocytes (Figure 5(a)), but instead
with the CD11b expressing microglia (Figure 5(b)).
Quantitation of the p47phox immunoreactivity was
carried out in the five selected areas in the bilateral stri-
atal regions. A significant increase in p47phox immunor-
eactivity was observed in the striatum (Figure 6(a)) as
well as in the hippocampus (data not shown) of the ische-
mic brain at 3 days after I/R. Measurement of fluorescent
intensity from different areas in the striatal and caudate
putamen region indicated that mice given either botanical
diet had a significant decrease in p47phox immunoreac-
tivity as compared with the ischemic group (Figure 6(b)).
Sutherlandia and Elderberry Consumption Inhibited
I/R-Induced Phospho-ERK1/2 Expression in
Microglial Cells
Recent studies with cultured microglial cells demon-
strated involvement of ERK1/2 in the oxidative/nitrosa-
tive pathways associated with stimulation by
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon gamma (IFNg;
Chuang et al., 2013). Based on the observations of
increased p47phox immunoreactivity and activated
microglial cells in striatum after I/R, we further examined
phospho-ERK1/2 expression in the ischemic brain sec-
tions and compared immunoreactivity with the groups
supplemented with Sutherlandia and elderberry diets.
Double immunostaining for phospho-ERK1/2 and
microglial marker CD11b indicated increased phospho-
ERK1/2 immunoreactivity colocalized with many

Discussion
This study demonstrates that dietary Sutherlandia and
elderberry mitigate behavioral deficits and pathology
induced by BCCA occlusion in mice. These results
agree with and extend our earlier studies using the
Mongolian gerbil model demonstrating botanicals such
as curcumin, apocynin, and grape polyphenols protect
against ischemic damage (Wang et al., 2005a, 2005b,
2006, 2009). With the gerbil model, BCCA occlusion
for 5 min causes extensive neuron cell death and glial
activation in the hippocampal CA1 area 4 days after
I/R (Wang et al., 2002). More recent studies by others
using the murine model, and BCCA occlusion for 22 min
resulted in damage in the hippocampal area as well as the
striatal area (Yoshioka et al., 2011b). In the present
study, we adopted the moderately severe murine BCCA
occlusion model to investigate effects of dietary
Sutherlandia and elderberry on I/R injury. BCCA occlu-
sion for 30 min and followed by reperfusion for 3 days
resulted in severe neuronal damage in the hippocampus,
and sporadic cell death in the cortex as well as in the
striatal/thalamus/basal ganglion regions. Using digital
pathology and the 5-point scoring system on cresyl
violet-stained brain sections, the results demonstrated
dietary Sutherlandia and elderberry significantly mitigate
the I/R-induced neuronal damage in all three brain
regions. A behavioral test using the accelerating rotarod
paradigm to monitor sensorimotor deficits of individual

animals further showed that dietary supplementation of
Sutherlandia and elderberry significantly ameliorated the
I/R-induced motor/coordination deficits.
Cerebral ischemia not only causes damage to neurons
but also activates glial cells, both astrocytes and micro-
glia. In previous studies with the gerbil model, a 5-min
BCCA occlusion followed by reperfusion for 4 days led
to prominent activation of astrocytes and microglial
cells around the hippocampal CA1 region, where pyr-
amidal neurons are extensively damaged (Wang et al.,
2005a, 2009). With this murine model, we observed sub-
stantially greater activation of microglial cells at 3 days
after a 30-min BCCA occlusion. The pattern of micro-
glial cells activation reflects the areas where neurons are
damaged. Alteration in microglial cell morphology
toward the phagocytic form at this time after reperfu-
sion is in agreement with the notion that microglia are
actively responding to neuronal injury and cell death.
The observation that mice consuming the Sutherlandia
or elderberry diets showed significantly less microglial
activation as compared with the ischemic brains of
mice consuming control diet supports the capacity of
these diets to mitigate neuron damage and microglial
activation.
With the BCCA occlusion model, significant increase
in astrocytes can be observed in the ischemic brain 3 days
after I/R. Unlike the focal ischemia model where exten-
sive astrogliosis is found in the penumbral area, astro-
cytes in the BCCA brain are more widespread in
different brain regions. Furthermore, there is no signifi-
cant difference in GFAP immunoreactivity comparing
ischemic mice given the Sutherlandia or elderberry diets
with control diets. These results further demonstrate
effects of Sutherlandia and elderberry to protect ischemic
damage through inhibiting neuron cell death and micro-
glial cell activation. Although these results suggest an
intimate relationship between neuronal damage and acti-
vation of microglial cells, more studies are needed to
better understand mode of communication between
these two cell types.
Increase in oxidative stress is an important factor in
reperfusion injury; and several studies have implicated
the involvement of NADPH oxidase as an important
source of ROS (Chen et al., 2009; Yoshioka et al.,
2011a). Although mechanisms for ROS produced by
NADPH oxidase in neurons and glial cells are not well
understood, our and other's studies (Brennan et al., 2009)
demonstrated rapid production of ROS in primary neu-
rons (minutes) on stimulation by the ionotropic glutam-
ate receptor agonist (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid, NMDA;
Shelat et al., 2008); however, production of ROS in
microglial cells follows a delayed process in hours
(Chuang et al., 2013). When botanicals such as honokiol
and Sutherlandia extract were used to test antioxidative
effect on neurons (stimulated with NMDA) and
microglial cells (stimulated with LPS), neurons were
more sensitive to the antioxidative action than microglial
cells (Chuang et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2014). The role of
NADPH oxidase in ROS production in neurons was
demonstrated by using neurons from p47phox-deficient
mice, which showed diminished response to ROS produc-
tion in response to excitotoxic agents (Brennan et al.,
2009). In the mouse model of global cerebral ischemia,
an increase in p47phox immunoreactivity was observed in
mouse striatum 3 days after I/R (Yoshioka et al., 2011a).
In the present study, we further localize the I/R-induced
increase in p47phox immunoreactivity to microglial cells.
Again, the significantly lower expression of p47phox
immunoreactivity in mice given the Sutherlandia and
elderberry diets as compared with that given the control
diet is in agreement with the observation of decreased
microglia activation.
It has been reported that I/R stimulates activation of
MAPK pathways, in particular, the p38 MAPK and the
Ras/MEK signaling (Nito et al., 2008), which are attrib-
uted to activation of the aquaporin-4 channel responsible
for astrocyte swelling (Nito et al., 2012). Other studies
also demonstrated upregulation of the MAPK/ERK1/2
pathway in brain after stroke (Sawe et al., 2008; Yenari
et al., 2010). In fact, ERK1/2 is regarded as the most
important member of the MAPK family capable of med-
iating a range of cellular responses, including motility,
inflammation, and cell survival as well as cell death
(Sawe et al., 2008). In our recent study with microglial
cells, IFNg not only stimulates the canonical Janus
kinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of
Transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway but also the
MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway, and in turn, phospho-ERK1/
2 is linked to activation of a number of cytoplasmic pro-
teins including p47phox of NADPH oxidase for ROS and
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) for nitric oxide
(NO) production (Chuang et al., 2013). Subsequently,
inhibition of phospho-ERK1/2 by U0126 abrogated
IFNg-induced NO and ROS production pin a dose-
dependent manner (Chuang et al., 2013). Our recent
study also demonstrated the capacity of Sutherlandia
extracts to inhibit IFNg-induced phospho-ERK1/2 and
subsequently mitigate ROS and NO production in micro-
glial cells (Jiang et al., 2014). Botanical polyphenols, for
example, the active ingredient of green tea, epigallocate-
chin-3-gallate, also attenuates NO production through
downregulation of ERK1/2-associated proteins including
ALDH2, ANXA1, and LGALS1 in LPS-stimulated BV-2
microglial cells (Qu et al., 2014). Other studies also dem-
onstrate a critical role of the MAPK/ERK pathway in
neuron excitation (Simon et al., 1984) and MEK/ERK
inhibitors mitigating brain damage in the stroke model
(Wang et al., 2003, 2004; Gladbach et al., 2013). Results
of this study further support the important role of phos-
pho-ERK1/2 expression in microglial cells after I/R, and

suppression in mice fed diets supplemented with
Sutherlandia and elderberry.
Because Sutherlandia is widely used in southern
Africa for symptoms of HIV/AIDS and elderberry diet-
ary supplements are among top selling products in
Europe and North America, these studies provide
new insights into use of these herbs as neuroprotective
agents. In summary, we have demonstrated significant
protective effects of dietary elderberry and Sutherlandia
against global cerebral ischemia-induced functional
motor deficits and neuropathological changes, including
neuronal cell death and microglial activation.
Results further support the hypotheses that these
botanicals exert beneficial effects against ischemic
damage through suppression of oxidative and proin-
flammatory pathways in neurons and microglial cells.
This study provides strong rationale to further investi-
gate the active components and mechanisms of action
and to determine whether their consumption amelior-
ates ischemic damage as well as neurodegenerative
diseases.
Summary
This study demonstrates that Sutherlandia and American
elderberry botanicals ameliorate ischemia/reperfusion
(stroke)-induced behavioral dysfunction, neuronal
damage, and oxidative stress and inflammatory responses
in microglial cells.
