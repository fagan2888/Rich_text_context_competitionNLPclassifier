In the past three decades, American prisons have experienced
an unprecedented increase in population. From 1980 to 1996,
state and federal incarceration rates grew by more than 200%.
In 1997, the imprisonment rate in the United States was 445
inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents (Blumstein & Beck,
1999). By 2008, there were 2,310,984 inmates in federal and
state custody, which translates to an imprisonment rate of
approximately 509 inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents (West
& Sabol, 2009). During the inmate population increase, cor-
rectional officers have played an important role in creating
and maintaining a safe and secure, humane prison environ-
ment, as well as playing a significant role in the lives of many
inmates (Farkas, 1999; Griffin, 2001; Hepburn & Knepper,
1993; Lambert et al., 2009). Due to correctional officers' piv-
otal roles in the lives of inmates, much research has been con-
ducted to determine how correctional officers perceive
inmates based on the officers' individual and institutional
characteristics. Individual characteristics studied by research-
ers generally consisted of age, gender, race, and education
level. In addition, institutional variables assessed by scholars
have included shift, seniority, role conflict, job stress, percep-
tions of danger, and supervisory support (Dowden & Tellier,
2004; Griffin, 2006; Lambert, Hogan, & Barton, 2002;
Whitehead & Lindquist, 1989).
As the job demands for correctional officers have
increased with the overall growth of U.S. prison populations,
research studies have focused on how correctional officers
have responded to changes in their job duties and expecta-
tions. In particular, they have concentrated on the relation-
ship between stress and correctional work (Lambert &
Paoline, 2005). Researchers have extensively studied the
physiological and psychological effects of stress on correc-
tional officers (Adwell & Miller, 1985; Brough & Williams,
2007; Carlson, Anson, & Thomas, 2003; Cheek, 1984;
Schaufeli & Peeters, 2000), while other studies have related
officers' individual characteristics and stress levels (Dowden
& Tellier, 2004; Triplett, Mullings, & Scarborough, 1996,
1999; Wright & Saylor, 1992; Zupan, 1986), and still others

The Impact of Correctional Officer
Perceptions of Inmates on Job Stress

Abstract
Research suggests that job-related stress affects correctional officers' attitudes toward their work environment, coworkers,
and supervisors, as well as their physical and mental health; however, very few studies have examined the relationship
between stress and attitudes toward inmates. This study examined the relationship between correctional officers' levels of
stress and their perceptions of inmates by surveying a sample of 501 correctional officers employed by a Southern prison
system. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to test the principal hypothesis of this study--that more negative
perceptions of inmates would result in higher levels of stress for correctional officers. Independent variables were grouped
into four groups (demographic variables, supervisory support, job characteristics, and attitudes toward inmates) and were
entered into the model in blocks. Lower supervisory support and perceptions of the job being dangerous were associated
with higher levels of job stress. More importantly, correctional officers who saw inmates as intimidated (not arrogant) and
nonmanipulative reported lower levels of job stress, while officers who perceived inmates as being unfriendly, antisocial, and
cold reported higher levels of stress.

have linked organizational variables with correctional offi-
cers' stress (Black, 2001; Dowden & Tellier, 2004; Finn,
1998; Hogan, Lambert, Jenkins, & Hall, 2009; Kauffman,
1988; Lambert, 2003; Lambert, et al., 2002; Lambert et al.,
2009; Triplett et al., 1999).
One area that researchers have not explored is how cor-
rectional officers' perceptions of inmates affect their stress
levels. Thus, the purpose of this study was to address this
deficiency. The authors hypothesized that officers' percep-
tions of inmates would cause an increase in correctional offi-
cer job stress.
Literature Review
Definition of Stress
There is not a clear consensus among researchers and schol-
ars on the definition of stress (Triplett et al., 1996). The
literature on job-related stress has used different definitions
tailored to their specific research focus. Generally speak-
ing, stress can be described as an individual experience dic-
tated by the way certain stressors are individually perceived
(Handy, 1988). In a more specific fashion, Blix, Cruise,
Mitchell, and Blix (1994) defined occupational stress as the
incapacity of a worker to handle different work demands
successfully. This study used Cullen, Link, Wolfe, and
Frank's (1985) definition of stress as "the psychological
discomfort or tension which results from exposure to stress-
ors" (p. 507). As indicated in the literature, stressors in cor-
rectional settings come from different sources, such as
direct contact with inmates, organizational variables, or
individual characteristics of officers (Cullen et al., 1985;
Dowden & Tellier, 2004; Lambert et al., 2009; Lambert &
Paoline, 2005).
Individual Characteristics'
Relationship With Job Stress
There are mixed findings in the literature on the relationship
between gender and job-related stress (Morgan, Van Haveren,
& Pearson, 2002). Cullen et al. (1985) and Zupan (1986)
found that female officers showed higher levels of stress
compared to their male counterparts, while Britton (1997)
and Triplett et al. (1996) did not find any difference in the
level of stress between male and female officers. In another
study, Carlson et al. (2003) found that female correctional
officers did not seem to be significantly affected by job-
related stress or burnout. Oppositely, Brough and Williams
(2007) reported that, among a sample of 132 Australian cor-
rectional officers, men appeared to have higher levels of psy-
chological fitness than their female counterparts.
Studies that have explored the relationship between age
and job-related stress have not yielded any irrefutable con-
clusions. Some studies found that older correctional officers
suffered a higher amount of stress (Lindquist & Whitehead,
1986), while others found that officer age was not linked to
job-related stress (Triplett et al., 1996). Whitehead and
Lindquist's (1986) study of correctional officers in the
Alabama correctional system found that younger officers
experienced more job-related stress than older correctional
officers. In a recent meta-analysis of past literature on pre-
dictors of correctional officer stress, Dowden and Tellier
(2004) asserted that the relationship between age and job
stress was mixed.
Tenure (i.e., length of employment) as a correctional offi-
cer has, at times, also been associated with job stress. Cullen
et al. (1985) and Lasky, Gordon, and Srebalus (1986) found
that correctional officers with higher tenure showed higher
levels of job-related stress. Conversely, other studies have
not found any link between tenure and job stress (Dignam,
Barrera, & West, 1986; Lindquist & Whitehead, 1986).
Like the other individual characteristics of gender, age,
and tenure, the relationship between race and job stress
among correctional officers is unclear. In a meta-analysis,
Dowden and Tellier (2004) reported that non-White officers
reported lower stress from work than White officers. In other
studies, a nonsignificant relationship was reported between
race and job stress (Lambert et al., 2009; Lambert, Hogan, &
Allen, 2006).
Generally, most past correctional officer job stress studies
have included the individual characteristics of gender, age,
tenure, and race. The findings, however, suggest that indi-
vidual characteristics are not powerful predictors of job
stress, particularly when institutional variables are included.
Institutional variables in general tend to be stronger predic-
tors of correctional officer job stress (Dowden & Tellier,
2004). Nevertheless, gender, age, tenure, and race were
included in the current study, more as control than explana-
tory variables.
Institutional Variables'
Relationship With Job Stress
It has been postulated that correctional orientation may be
linked with job stress of correctional officers. According to
the literature, there are two types of officers with divergent
correctional orientations. First, there are custody-oriented
officers who openly advocate for punishment strategies to
deal with inmates and who do not support rehabilitation as a
correctional philosophy. Conversely, human service-oriented
officers believe in rehabilitation as the primary correctional
goal and support a more counseling-oriented role for the cor-
rectional officer (Cullen et al., 1985; Lindquist & Whitehead,
1986). The two forms of correctional orientation can lead to
role conflict for officers. Some researchers have suggested
that when stress increases, correctional officers tend to
embrace a custodial orientation to reduce stress (Poole &
Regoli, 1980); however, Robinson, Porporino, and Simourd
(1997) indicated that the more custody-oriented a correc-
tional officer is, the more stress he or she suffers. In addition,
Misis et al. 3
abundant research has found that role stress has a positive
relationship with job stress (Cullen et al., 1985; Dowden &
Tellier, 2004; Griffin, 2006; Grossi & Berg, 1991; Hepburn
& Knepper, 1993; Lambert & Paoline, 2005; Lasky et al.,
1986; Tewksbury & Higgins, 2006; Whitehead & Lindquist,
1986). Role conflict is a salient predictor of job stress for
correctional officers (Dowden & Tellier, 2004). As such, role
conflict was included in the current study.
Supervisors are critical for correctional officers to be suc-
cessful at their jobs (Lambert, Jiang, & Hogan, 2008).
Supervisory consideration has been reported to be negatively
associated with correctional officer job stress (Lambert et al.,
2009). Furthermore, supervisory support leads to lower job
stress among correctional staff (Lambert & Hogan, 2009). In
addition, peer support is important in helping reduce job
stress among correctional officers (Lambert, Altheimer, &
Hogan, 2010). The literature supports the contention that
social support, such as peer and supervisory support, is
important in dealing with potential work stressors (i.e., fac-
tors that lead to job stress) and dealing with job stress when
it arises (Lambert et al., 2010; Lindquist & Whitehead,
1986). In light of the fact that they are salient predictors of
job stress for correctional officers, peer support and supervi-
sory support were included in the current study.
Consequences of Correctional Officer Stress
At the individual level, stress can have serious consequences
for correctional officers, their families, and friends.
Researchers have reported that correctional officers com-
monly suffer from stress-related illnesses such as hyperten-
sion, heart disease, depression, and anxiety (Adwell &
Miller, 1985; Cheek & Miller, 1983; Finn, 1998). Other
studies have established that correctional officers show a
great deal of anger toward their family and friends, aggres-
sion, high rates of divorce, posttraumatic stress disorder,
and drug abuse, at least a portion of which can be attributed
to job stress (Cheek, 1984; Cornelius, 1994, 2001; Finn,
1998; Janik, 1995).
At the organizational level, Tewksbury and Higgins
(2006) noted that stress has very detrimental consequences
in criminal justice organizations. In fact, correctional officers
with high levels of stress are more likely to be less effective
and less satisfied with their jobs (Tewksbury & Higgins,
2006). Other detrimental consequences of job-related stress
for correctional officers are withdrawal symptoms, increased
absenteeism, and tardiness (Lambert et al., 2006). Perhaps
the most important organizational consequence of occupa-
tional stress among correctional officer is turnover. The
annual rate of correctional officer turnover has been esti-
mated to be between 12% and 25% (Lambert, 2001; Lommel,
2004). Hill (2004) estimated that nearly 25% of first year
correctional officers quit their jobs. Similarly, Tewksbury
and Higgins (2006) suggested that more than 50% of correc-
tional officers quit their jobs within 13 months of hire, which
could be related to job stress. As stress from work has nega-
tive outcomes that can be detrimental to officers and the cor-
rectional institution, it is critical to explore and identify the
predictors of job stress.
Correctional Officer Perceptions of Inmates
What remains unexplored is whether perceptions of inmates
are related to job stress for correctional officers. Correctional
officers work directly with inmates, and their perceptions of
inmates may either enhance or reduce the possibility of stress
from the job. If officers view inmates negatively, then they
may become frustrated and tense when having to deal with
them, and this in turn could lead to higher levels of stress
from work. Conversely, if an officer has positive perceptions
of inmates, then they may have more pleasant and less con-
frontational interactions with inmates, and this in the end can
result in more positive feelings and less strain from work,
ultimately leading to lower job stress.
Previous researchers have examined individual and
demographic characteristics as a source of correctional offi-
cers' perceptions of inmates. Gender, age, tenure, and race
have been linked positively or negatively to correctional
officers' attitudes toward inmates. Generally speaking, the
literature has shown a relationship between gender and offi-
cer attitudes toward inmates, with mixed results on whether
men generally hold more punitive attitudes (Jurik, 1985;
Whitehead, Lindquist, & Klofas, 1987; Zupan, 1986).
Lambert, Paoline, Hogan, and Baker (2007) and Crouch and
Alpert (1982) observed that female officers were less puni-
tive. Farkas (1999) found that female staff showed a puni-
tive approach in their attitudes; however, they expressed
great preference for counseling roles and greater concern for
corruption of authority. Zimmer (1986) noted that women's
belief in their abilities to carry out their work influenced
their attitudes toward inmates.
The literature reflects an association between age and
positive relationships with inmates (Farkas, 1999; Jurik,
1985; Klofas, 1986; Klofas & Toch, 1982). Younger officers
tended to show a more custody-oriented approach, while
older officers showed a stronger support for rehabilitation
(Jurik, 1985) and seemed to have a more positive approach to
inmates (Klofas & Toch, 1982). Farkas (1999) conducted a
study to determine the orientation of correctional officers
toward inmates in a Midwestern state. She found that older
officers expressed a very strong support for rehabilitative
efforts and concluded that older officers either believed in
what they were doing or had bonded with the organization or
the goals of the organization.
The research to date on the relationship between tenure
and perceptions of inmates is mixed. Sometimes tenure is
inversely associated with support for rehabilitation and posi-
tively associated with support for punishment (Shamir &
Drory, 1982; Van Voorhis, Cullen, Link, & Wolfe, 1991). In
other studies, the opposite is reported (Cullen, Latessa,
4 SAGE Open
Burton, & Lombardo, 1993; Toch & Grant, 1982; Toch &
Klofas, 1982), or no relationship is reported (Arthur, 1994;
Gordon, 2006; Robinson, Porporino, & Simourd, 1993).
Research on the relationship between officers' tenure and
attitudes toward inmates has not yielded conclusive findings.
Some studies did not find any relationship between officers'
tenure and attitudes toward inmates (Cullen, Lutze, Link, &
Wolfe, 1989; Jacobs & Kraft, 1978), while others found that
officers with more tenure tend to hold more rehabilitative
values (Toch & Grant, 1982; Toch & Klofas, 1982).
Conversely, Jurik (1985) and Poole and Regoli (1980) found
that officers with higher tenure were higher in custodial ori-
entation and also expressed more disbelief in the rehabilita-
tive approach.
When race is used as an independent variable, some stud-
ies could not relate race and punitive attitudes toward inmates
(Crouch & Alpert, 1982; Jacobs & Kraft, 1978; Klofas,
1986). Conversely, other studies have shown that minority
officers (especially African American officers) showed a
higher preference for rehabilitation and a more positive atti-
tude toward inmates (Jurik, 1985; Toch & Klofas, 1982). In
their study of correctional officers in theAlabama Department
of Corrections, Whitehead and Lindquist (1989) indicated
that White officers do not hold more negative perceptions
toward inmates compared with African American officers.
Although the findings are somewhat mixed, overall, there is
little empirical support for the contention that increasing the
presence of African American officers in correctional facili-
ties would increase the number of officers who hold more
positive attitudes about their interactions with inmates.
As individual characteristics may be linked to job stress
and perceptions of inmates, it is important to include them in
an analysis to determine the relationship between percep-
tions of inmates and job stress among correctional officers;
therefore, as previously indicated, gender, age, tenure, and
race were included in this study as possible predictors of cor-
rectional officer work stress.
Some research has analyzed how role conflict affects cor-
rectional officers' attitudes toward inmates. Whitehead and
Lindquist (1989) concluded that there is no connection
between role conflict and attitudes toward inmates, while
Cullen et al. (1989) and Poole and Regoli (1980) found a
direct relationship between role conflict and officers' puni-
tive attitudes toward inmates. Regarding role stress (com-
prising role conflict and role ambiguity), some studies have
found role stress was related with higher levels of punitive-
ness among correctional officers (Poole & Regoli, 1980;
Shamir & Drory, 1982).
Because role conflict is linked with perceptions of inmates
and job stress, it was included in the current study. How peer
support or supervisory support may be associated with per-
ceptions of inmates is unclear; however, both forms of social
support have been found to be salient predictors of job stress
among correctional staff and, therefore, should be included
in analysis of how perceptions of inmates may be associated
with correctional officer work stress.
The Relationship Between Officers'
Perceptions of Inmates and Job Stress
Research has indicated that correctional officers are com-
monly worried about inmate violence, overcrowding, prison
gangs, and certain locations in prison (Black, 2001;
Cornelius, 1994, 2001; Finn, 1998). As confrontations and
inmate violence are relatively common in U.S. prisons (Finn,
1998), correctional officers often work in a very stressful and
dangerous environment. The fear of being assaulted or wit-
nessing violent incidents among inmates is a constant source
of stress for officers (Black, 2001; Cornelius, 1994). While
researchers have looked at inmates' effect on stress, few
studies have examined the effect that correctional officer
perceptions of inmates have on their stress levels; therefore,
this study adds to what is known about stress by assessing
how correctional officers' perceptions of inmates affect their
levels of job stress, while including the variables of gender,
age, tenure, race, peer support, supervisory support, and role
conflict. By including individual and institutional variables,
a clearer picture will be gained whether and how perceptions
of inmates are linked with correctional officer job stress.
Method
Participants
Due to agency concerns about both the correctional officers'
time away from work responsibilities and causing the least
amount of disruption to the prison schedule, this study uti-
lized a purposive sample. A purposive sample is generated
based on participant availability and accessibility. For the cur-
rent study, only officers with 8 months or more of tenure who
had direct contact with inmates were asked to participate, as
these individuals could be surveyed during their required
annual in-service training with the agency. Data were gath-
ered through self-report surveys administered to correctional
officers attending annual in-service training. The correctional
officers were all from one region out of six regions that com-
prised a Southern prison system. The selected region con-
tained 13 prisons, which ranged in security level from
minimum to high maximum. Specifically, one prison was
high maximum security, four were maximum security, five
were medium security, and three were minimum security. The
number of inmates at each prison ranged from 800 to 2,000.
All the selected correctional officers worked as housing unit
officers. Each housing unit held between 100 and 250 inmates.
All 13 prisons housed male inmates (i.e., no prisons in this
region housed female inmates). Finally, the surveyed officers
represented all 13 institutions in this region. Unfortunately,
no information about the security level of the institution at
Misis et al. 5
which the participant worked was collected in the survey.
Participants were informed that involvement in the survey
was completely voluntary, and informed consent was obtained
prior to survey administration. A total of 630 surveys were
administered with 501 completed surveys returned, for a
response rate of 79%.
Approximately 66% of the participants were men. The
agency correctional officer population at the time of the sur-
vey was 57% male and 43% female. The age of the partici-
pants ranged from 18 to 64 years, with a mean average age of
38.18 years (SD = 12.78). This is similar to the age range of
the entire agency correctional officer complement. The aver-
age tenure (i.e., years of employment as a correctional offi-
cer) for this sample was 7.50 years (SD = 6.41). The length
of tenure was similar to the agency population. The majority
of the participants were White (68%), followed by African
American (20%), Hispanic (6.0%), and Other (5.0%). Seven
(1%) employees chose not to provide a response for the race
question. The racial breakdown of the surveyed population
was White (57%), African American (25%), Hispanic (17%),
and Other (1%). For gender, age, and tenure, the participants
were similar to the overall population of correctional officers
in the state prison system. For race, the participants were
slightly higher for Whites and the "Other" racial category
and lower for Hispanics for overall correctional officer
population.
Variables
Dependent Variable. Six items from Cullen et al. (1985) were
used to measure job stress among correctional officers: (a)
When I am at work I often feel tense or uptight; (b) A lot of
times, my job makes me very frustrated or angry; (c) There
are several aspects of my job that make me upset about
things; (d) I am usually calm or at ease at work (reverse
coded); (e) I don't consider this to be a stressful job (reverse
coded); and (f) My job is worse than those of other people I
know. The response options for these items was a 5-point
Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree (coded 1) to
strongly agree (coded 5). The Cronbach's alpha reliability
for the job stress scale was .74. The responses to the six items
were summed together to form an index measuring job stress.
Higher scores on this scale denoted higher levels of officer
job stress.
Independent Variables. The individual characteristics of gen-
der, age, tenure, and race were included more as control than
explanatory variables. Gender was coded as 0 = female and
1 = male. The age of participants in years was coded as a
continuous variable. Tenure measured the number of years
employed as a correctional officer and was measured as a
continuous variable. Race was coded as 0 = non-White and
1 = White.
Five items adapted from Cullen et al. (1985) and Toch and
Klofas (1982) were used to measure perceived support from
coworkers. These items were (a) My fellow officers compli-
ment someone who has done their job well, (b) My fellow
officers blame each other when things go wrong (reverse
coded), (c) I am able to talk about work-related problems
with my coworkers, (d) I am able to talk about non-work-
related problems with my coworkers, and (e) My fellow offi-
cers help one another when someone needs to improve their
performance. The response options for these items was a
5-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree
(coded 1) to strongly agree (coded 5). By adding the
responses to these five items together, an index was created
to measure support from coworkers, and the reliability of the
item was .60, which is on the low end of acceptable. High
scores were indicative of high levels of perceived coworker
support.
Perceived supervisory support was assessed using a five
items adapted from Cullen et al. (1985) and Triplett et al.
(1996). Five statements asked participants about the per-
ceived level of social support from supervisory staff and
were as follows: (a) My supervisors often encourage the
people I work with if they are doing well, (b) My supervisors
often blame others when things go wrong which are possibly
not the fault of those blamed (reverse coded), (c) My super-
visors often encourage us to do the job in a way that we
would be proud of, (d) Supervisors care more about inmates
than they do C.O.'s (reverse coded), and (e) Most supervi-
sors are concerned about correctional officer morale.
Participants responded on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging
from strongly disagree (coded 1) to strongly agree (coded 5).
The responses to these items were added to form an index,
and the reliability of the supervisory support index was .76.
High scores were indicative of higher levels of perceived
supervisory support.
Five items from Cullen et al. (1985) were used to measure
role conflict: (a) The formal chain of command is not adhered
to, (b) I receive conflicting requests at work from two or
more people, (c) I work on unnecessary tasks or projects on
the job, (d) My job duties and work objectives are unclear to
me, and (e) I lack the authority to carry out my job responsi-
bilities. Role conflict was defined as any situation in which a
correctional officer had conflicting job demands, such as role
ambiguity. Participants responded to these items using a
5-point Likert-type scale of strongly disagree (coded 1) to
strongly agree (coded 5). Reliability of the role conflict scale
was .63, which is on the low end of acceptability. The
responses to the five items were summed together to form an
index measuring role conflict. High scores were indicative of
higher perceptions of role conflict.
Perceptions of inmates was the primary independent vari-
able of focus in this study. Participants were asked a series of
16 items asking them to rank their perceptions of the typical
inmate on a scale of 1 to 7 for series of 16 areas anchored by
positive and negative adjectives. These items were adapted
from a survey utilized by Gerstein, Topp, and Correll (1987)
and can be found in the appendix.
6 SAGE Open
One of the important objectives of the current study was
to investigate the relative impacts of attitudes of inmates on
job stress among correctional officers. To assist in clarifying
the number of underlying dimensions in the survey items, an
exploratory principle-component factor analysis was con-
ducted (Kim & Titterington, 2009; Sawyer, Tsao, Hansen, &
Flood, 2006). A principal component analysis of the items
yielded a 4-factor solution according to the scree plot, an
eigenvalue greater than 1.0, and the Kaiser­Maeyer­Olkin
Measure of sampling adequacy = .83. This 4-factor model
accounted for a substantial 54% of the total variance, and
each of the individual factors accounted for 18%, 16%, 10%,
and 9% of the variance, respectively, according to the cate-
gories listed in Table 1 (Haslam & Levy, 2006; Sawyer et al.,
2006). Item loadings for the varimax-rotated factors are also
presented in Table 1.
As shown in Table 1, six items loaded strongly onto Factor I.
These items related to virtues an inmate may or may not pos-
sess (i.e., "Motivated versus Unmotivated," "Sensitive ver-
sus Insensitive," "Willing versus Resistant," "Truthful versus
Deceiving," "Flexible versus Rigid," "Moral versus
Immoral"). Results showed that the factor loadings range
between .53 and .72, which all exceed the minimum level
(.30) for interpretation of structure (Hair, Black, Babin,
Anderson, & Tatham, 2006; Kim & Titterington, 2009;
Sawyeretal.,2006).Thisfactorwaslabeledas"Respectable."
Factor II contained five loadings, and this factor was labeled
as"Reasonable"basedontheitemsloaded(i.e.,"Unintelligent
versus Intelligent," "Afraid versus Confident," "Hostile
versus Agreeable," "Uncooperative versus Cooperative,"
"Irrational versus Rational"). Results indicated that the
Factor II loadings ranged from .38 to .77. Two items loaded
onto Factor III with the loadings .69 and .73, respectively.
This factor was labeled "Manageable" based on the items
loaded (i.e., "Arrogant versus Intimidated," "Manipulative
versus Nonmanipulative"). Factor IV contains three load-
ings, which were named "Amiable" based on the items
loaded (i.e., "Unfriendly versus Friendly," "Social versus
Antisocial," "Cold versus Warm"). Results indicated that the
Factor IV loadings ranged between .52 and .68. The four
variables representing views of inmates were created using
the factor scores.
Table 2 provides the descriptive statistics (mean and stan-
dard deviation) of the variables used in the study.
Results
Job Stress Predictors
Hierarchical multiple regression procedures were used to
examine the predictive strength of selected demographic
variables (age, gender, race, and tenure), support (peer sup-
port and supervisory support), job characteristic (role con-
flict), and attitudes toward inmates (respectable, reasonable,

computes the significance of each added variable or set of
variables in blocks to the explanation reflected in R2 for pur-
poses of assessing the importance of the independents
(Garson, 2010).
Four sets of predictor variables were added to the model
in blocks, in the following order: demographic variables,
supports, job characteristics, and views toward inmates.
Because two or more independent variables are combined
into each construct prior to running the regression analysis,
the independent variables of the same construct were entered
to the model together in blocks. High intercorrelation among
the independent variables within a block is intentional and
desirable, and normally this is not considered "multicol-
linearity" (Garson, 2010). Of concern within each set of vari-
ables were the significant variables in the present step after
controlling for the effect of the previous step (Lee, Chronister,
& Bishop, 2008; Miller et al., 2009). Tests for significant
incremental changes in the R2 statistic were carried out at
every step (Lee et al., 2008). At each step, individual vari-
ables within the block were explored and removed if they did
not correlate significantly with attitudes toward inmates or
improve sensitivity of the model (Nosek, Hughes, Taylor, &
Taylor, 2006). By excluding all the irrelevant predictors, a
more significant t test for the individual predictor is expected
and the issue of the lack of statistical power due to relatively
small sample size can be addressed (Hair et al., 2006).
Results of the hierarchical multiple regression analysis are
summarized in Table 3.
Demographic variables were entered as the first block.
Collectively these variables were significant, F(4, 486) =
5.39, p  .001, but explained only 4% of the job stress
variance (R2 = .04, adjusted R2 =.04). As shown in Table 3,
the demographic variables found to be significant were age
(b = -.06,  = -.18, p  .001) and gender (b = 1.07,  = .12,
p  .05). These two variables were retained in Model 2
(Nosek et al., 2006).
In the second step, the variables of age and gender were
entered first to control for the relationship with job stress,
and they were followed by the entry of two support vari-
ables (peer support and supervisory support) as indepen-
dent factors. This model (Model 2 in Table 3), as a whole,
correlated significantly with job stress, F(4, 489) = 32.46, p
 .001. As shown in Table 3, Model 2 was shown to explain
more variance in job stress. Approximately 21% of the vari-
ance (R2 = .21, adjusted R2 = .20) in job stress was accounted
by the new model. The significant relationships among
individual variables were evaluated, leaving only the super-
visory support variable (b = -.41,  = -.38, p  .001) in this
model.
In the third step, the variables for supervisory support
and role conflict were entered into a regression equation
(Model 3 in Table 3). Model 3, as a whole, correlated sig-
nificantly with job stress, F(3, 494) = 67.64, p  .001, and
explained 22% (R2 = 22, adjusted R2 =.21) of the variance in
job stress. The significant relationships among individual
variables were evaluated leaving the variable of supervisory
support (b = -.38,  = -.35, p  .001) as well as role conflict
(b = .22,  = .18, p .001).
In the fourth step, the variables of supervisory support,
role conflict, and the attitudes toward inmates were added to
the model (Model 4 in Table 3). Model 4 as a whole explained
23% (R2 = .23, adjusted R2 = .22) of the variance in job stress.

After the variables of attitudes toward inmates had been
entered as predictors, there was an increase in the prediction
of job stress, F(4, 490) = 2.83, p = .02. The block of atti-
tudes toward inmates uniquely accounted for 2% of explained
variance in job stress and supports the hypothesis that vari-
ables of attitudes toward inmates would explain additional
variance in job stress beyond that explained by individual
and institutional variables. As before, significant contribu-
tions of the independent variables were evaluated, and "man-
ageable" and "amiable" in the block of attitudes toward
inmates were found to be significant.
The final model consisted of four variables significantly
correlating with job stress, F(4, 496) = 36.67, p  .001, and
accounted for a total of 23% of the variability (R2 = .23,
adjusted R2 = .22). The beta () values showed that job stress
was best predicted by supervisory support, role conflict,
"amiable," and "manageable" in this order ( = -.32, .17,
.09, and -.07, respectively). Overall, results demonstrate that
the less supervisory support and the more role conflict the
officers reported, the higher their level of job stress. In terms
of attitudes toward inmates, officers who view the inmates as
intimidated and nonmanipulative reported lower levels of
job stress, whereas the ones who view their inmates as
friendly, social, and warm reported higher levels of job
stress.
Discussion and Conclusion
The findings of this study yielded interesting results about
the effects of perceptions of inmates on job stress among
correctional officers. First, officers who saw inmates as
being manageable had lower levels of stress. This could be
because officers who see inmates as devious (i.e., not
straightforward) are worried about being assaulted, being
manipulated by inmates, or see the perceived devious
nature of inmates as a job stressor. However, views of
inmates as being amiable was positively associated with
job stress. Of particular interest is the finding that officers
who see inmates as warm, friendly, and social report higher
levels of stress. This would coincide with research on role
conflict in which officers who see themselves as treatment-
oriented have higher levels of stress (Tewksbury & Higgins,
2006). In particular, officers might find that their positive
perceptions of inmates are not embraced by their coworkers
or supervisors (Dial & Johnson, 2008; Kauffman, 1988).
This, in turn, could cause stress and alienation. Officers
who are "nice" to offenders are often considered to be too
friendly, which could alienate them from coworkers and
supervisors. This alienation often solidifies the bond that
they have with the offender and further causes tension
between themselves and officers (Worley & Cheeseman,
2006). It could also be that officers who have positive per-
ceptions of inmates might find this to be an internal conflict
as well as this goes against the traditional "us versus them"
mentality in corrections (Cheeseman Dial, Kim, Lambert,
& Hogan, 2011). In addition, officers who have positive
views of inmates could become closer to inmates, allowing
inmates to take advantage of them, also causing stress.
Conversely, officers who see inmates as amiable might also
find their sociable nature annoying and would prefer that
the inmates kept their distance (Cheeseman Dial et al.,
2011). Another area to consider that has yet to be addressed
in the research literature is whether correctional officer
stress causes negative views of inmates or if negative views
of inmates cause stress. Correctional agencies may have to
reexamine how officers perceive inmates and the impact
that this has on their feelings and perceptions about the job.
Likewise, it is likely that inmates change how they interact
with staff over time, and these interactions probably influ-
ence the perceptions of officers. Longitudinal studies are
needed to explore how perceptions of inmates and job stress
relate to one another.
Officers receive training on many aspects of their jobs.
Based on the results of this study, correctional agencies
might benefit from more training on offender personality
and how inmates are perceived. Traditionally, officers are
taught that the offenders are the enemy and that their job is
to ensure that offenders remain under control and con-
tained within the correctional facility. This attitude is then
reinforced in the correctional officer subculture and con-
tinues to be perpetuated at many levels within correctional
agencies (Cheeseman Dial et al., 2011). Correctional offi-
cers might benefit from a balanced approach to dealing
with inmates. This might also help to alleviate correctional
officer role conflict. In addition, correctional agencies
might actually be able to use this as a tool to find correc-
tional counselors or treatment professionals by finding
officers who have positive views of inmates and who see
their potential for change. It might help to decrease job
stress if correctional agencies could identify officers who
are best suited for treatment-oriented positions or place
treatment-oriented officers in more treatment-oriented
facilities. In most correctional agencies, treatment is not a
major function of correctional officers, and employees
who embrace a more treatment-oriented ideology might
find treatment-oriented work in the prison environment
more rewarding as well as less stressful (Toch & Grant,
1982).
One area that should be further explored is how percep-
tions of inmates relate to correctional orientation among cor-
rectional officers. The literature has dichotomized
correctional orientation toward inmates into two categories:
support for rehabilitation and support for punishment
(Robinson et al., 1993). Support for punishment refers to a
view that inmates while in prison should be punished for
their crimes (Whitehead & Lindquist, 1989). Support for
rehabilitation refers to a view that inmates should receive
treatment for their criminologic needs (Cullen et al., 1989;
Griffin, 2002). Correctional orientation is a salient area to
study because correctional officers often have prolonged
Misis et al. 9
interactions with the inmates, which can influence either
directly or indirectly the behaviors of offenders within prison
and once they are released (Farkas, 1999; Gordon, 2006). In
addition, past research has observed that support for treat-
ment is positively associated with job involvement (i.e., psy-
chological identification with the job), job satisfaction (i.e.,
the level of satisfaction with the job), and organizational
commitment (i.e., the level of psychological commitment to
the organization) among correctional staff, and conversely,
support for punishment has a negative association with job
satisfaction and organizational commitment (Cullen et al.,
1989; Farkas, 1999; Lambert, Hogan, Barton, Jiang, &
Baker, 2008; Robinson et al., 1993). Job involvement, job
satisfaction, and organizational commitment have salient
outcomes for correctional officers and correctional organiza-
tions (Cullen et al., 1989; Griffin, 2001; Hogan et al., 2009;
Lambert, 2001; Robinson et al., 1993). Simply put, correc-
tional orientation is a salient concept to study among correc-
tional officers.
Support for punishment and treatment were not directly
measured in this study. While seems likely that holding
positive views of inmates will be linked with support for
treatment, and, similarly, holding negative perceptions of
inmates will likely be linked with greater levels of support
for punishment, no information on either form of correc-
tional orientation was collected in the survey, so these
hypotheses remain untested postulations. Future studies
should explore how perceptions of inmates relate to cor-
rectional orientation. Moreover, correctional officers are
likely to hold mixed views on treatment and punishment.
In this study, the perceptions of inmates varied among the
surveyed officers. Some officers had far more positive
views of inmates than did others, who saw inmates in a
very negative light or who held a mixture of positive and
negative perceptions of inmates. Like perceptions of
inmates, the two major dimensions of correctional orienta-
tion are not mutually exclusive. Correctional officers can
have support for varying degrees of rehabilitation and pun-
ishment, as is also found among the general public (Cullen,
Pealer, Fisher, Applegate, & Santana, 2002). Research is
needed to identify the variables that are important in help-
ing shape the perceptions of inmates and correctional ori-
entation of officers and why they vary as well as overlap
with one another.
An additional area of research to be considered is what
correctional officers' views of inmates are when they first
start their jobs and what they think of inmates throughout
their careers. It might be more stressful for individuals who
start out with positive perceptions of inmates to have them
evolve into negative views, or the converse might be true.
Officers who start off with negative attitudes might experi-
ence high levels of stress if they also see life and their work
as negative. It might also be interesting to determine whether
men and women perceive inmates differently and the impact
that this has on their job stress. Farkas (1999) found that
female officers had a more punitive approach, while others
have found no relationship between gender and punitiveness
(Cullen et al., 1989; Leiber, 2000; Leiber & Woodrick, 1997).
It could be that if women in this study held punitive views,
coupled with negative perceptions of inmates, might cause
increased levels of stress. This clearly needs to be explored
in future studies.
This study was exploratory in nature; therefore, further
research on the elements involved in views of inmates would
benefit not only correctional agencies but correctional offi-
cers as well. It could be argued that one stressor might lead
to another, which might lead to burnout and job dissatisfac-
tion. As a result, path modeling might also be a way to
unravel how the variables in this study affect job stress
among correctional officers.
As with many studies, the current study had limitations.
One limitation of this study was that the research was con-
ducted in a single region of a Southern prison system. While
the results of this study are important, they may not be gen-
eralized to all correctional agencies across the United States.
Additional studies are needed at other correctional facilities
to determine whether the results can be replicated. A study
that incorporates other regions of the United States and com-
pares perceptions of inmates among correctional officers
would be an important addition to the literature and may
explain why correctional officer stress is experienced differ-
ently in particular areas of the United States. In addition, the
use of a purposive sample did not include correctional offi-
cers with less than 8 months of tenure, as these individuals
were not required to attend in-service training. New employ-
ees may provide information that could be critical in retain-
ing employees.
Another limitation was that no information was col-
lected about security level. As security level may be associ-
ated with level of job stress, future studies should include
this measure. This current study was based on a cross-sec-
tional design (i.e., data collected at one time), and as such,
causal relationships cannot be empirically demonstrated.
All that can be concluded at this time is that perceptions of
inmates and job stress are associated with one another.
Longitudinal studies are needed to demonstrate the causal
relationship between the two variables. Furthermore, the
type of facility/security level at which the participants
worked was not asked in the survey, and as such, could not
be included in the analyses. It is very possible that the rela-
tionships of perceptions of inmates and the other variables
used in this study with job stress may vary by the type of
facility/security level. This is a salient issue that should be
addressed in future research in this area. In addition to per-
ceptions of inmates, only three other workplace variables
(i.e., peer support, supervisory support, and role conflict)
were included in the analyses. Additional workplace vari-
ables should be included in the analyses to see if additional
variance in job stress can be explained. In the current study,
only about 23% of the observed variance in the job stress
10 SAGE Open
index was accounted for by the independent variables. This
means that approximately 77% of the variance of job stress
variable is accounted for by other unknown variables.
These variables need to be identified and included in future
studies.
Another shortcoming of the current study was that the
Cronbach's alpha for the scales of peer support and role
conflict were low, which raises the issue of reliability for
these measures. Future research needs to examine whether
more reliable measures would result in different findings.
Moreover, additional research is needed to test the dimen-
sionality of the perceptions of inmates observed in the cur-
rent study. It could be that perceptions of inmates may be
contextual and situational, and as such, the results may vary
between different types of correctional institutions. Future
researchers may wish to explore how perceptions of inmates
are influenced by the correctional officer culture and social-
ization at different correctional institutions. Finally, it is
unknown how perceptions of inmates would affect other
salient outcomes among correctional officers, such as orga-
nizational commitment, job involvement, burnout, life sat-
isfaction, absenteeism, and turnover. Future research in
these and other areas are needed. Although the study has
limitations, the empirical findings have potential implica-
tions. It is hoped the current study will spark further
research on the area of perceptions of inmates and how it
related to job stress and other work outcomes among cor-
rectional staff.
Corrections is a business that involves people processing
people. It also requires intense and frequent interactions
with inmates. The synergistic effects of stressors associated
with working in corrections are exhibited in a variety of
physical and mental symptoms. Correctional executives
and immediate supervisors who ignore these effects will
inevitably be faced with lower levels of employee morale
and higher levels of employee absenteeism, poor health,
and turnover. It should also be noted that stress is a multi-
faceted and complex problem. This study is not meant to
imply that perceptions of inmates are a sole cause of stress;
it is just one piece of the puzzle to be considered. Essentially,
few studies have looked at how correctional officers actu-
ally perceived inmates and how these perceptions influence
how officers see their jobs and experience stress. To ignore
the interaction of correctional officers and offenders is to
ignore an area that can and does have profound effects on
correctional officer stress.
