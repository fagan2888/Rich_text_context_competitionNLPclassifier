Abstract
We report development of an aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) that was located in the proximal
region of the femur in an 11-year-old girl. Over a period of 30 weeks, the ABC showed fulminant
local progression, with destruction of the bone, which led to an abrupt loss of function of the left
hip. The standard tumour treatment protocol was followed. We performed embolisation of the
tumour followed by a biopsy, which confirmed the diagnosis of ABC. The outcome was negative
with total destruction of the proximal third of the femur, despite repeating the embolisation.
Because of the unfavourable local progression, a second biopsy was performed and we recon-
firmed the initial diagnosis. The final decision regarding the therapeutic approach was total hip
arthroplasty with femoral reconstruction with a prosthesis. Following this treatment, the patient's
outcome was favourable, with complete recovery of function and no local relapse.

Introduction
Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is an osteo-
lytic benign tumour, which is usually situ-
ated in the metaphysis of long bones and
mostly encountered in patients younger
than 20 years old.1 The structure of this
tumour is poorly organised, with vascular
gaps separated by fibrous membranes com-
posed of fibroblasts, giant multinucleate
cells, and osteoclasts, which represent a
multi-chamber aspect.1,2 The cells in ABC
have an osteoclast-like phenotype (CD51þ,
CD14À, cathepsin Kþ, TRAPþ) and are
responsible for lacunar resorption3
Most ABCs are diagnosed during child-
hood or adolescence.4 Most causes of ABC
are unknown and are usually discovered by
accident, following some type of trauma. If
ABC has a large dimension, it tends to
deform the anatomy of the affected
region. When the aneurysmal cyst is in-
creased in volume, the main symptom may
be nonspecific pain in the concerned area.
All bones can be affected by this pathology,
but the proximal femur is most frequently
involved.5 From a histopathological point
of view, ABC can be classified into three
types: conventional (vascular) type, which
is a rapidly growing, extensive, damaging
lesion, leading to cortical breach and soft
tissue aggression; solid type, and a third
mixed type of the other two types.6
The most commonly used radiological
investigation for ABC is plain radiography.
Radiography often reveals an extensive
tumour-like osteolytic lesion, located in
the metaphyseal area of the long bones,
with no invasion of the growth cartilage,
and is well separated from the adjacent
soft tissues.7 Magnetic resonance imaging
scans regularly show an extensive tumour
with eccentric osteolysis and a polylobu-
lated aspect with fluid-fluid levels.6 The dif-
ferential diagnosis for an aneurysmal cyst
can be essential bone cyst, giant cell
tumour, osteoblastoma, and telangiectatic
osteosarcoma.2 A biopsy is mandatory for
an aneurysmal cyst because telangiectatic
osteosarcoma needs to be considered as a
differential diagnosis.
The classic procedure for ABC is a direct
approach with opening of the cyst and its
curettage. However, because of the high re-
currence rate associated with this type of
treatment (11­31%),8 local adjuvant thera-
pies are added to the procedure. These ther-
apies include surgical cryotherapy,9 alcohol
sclerotherapy,10 selective arterial embolisa-
tion,11 and use of denosumab.12
Denosumab is an innovative therapeutic
approach, which inhibits osteoclast func-
tion, and can have positive effects on the
development of ABCs. The purpose of
treatment is to stop extension of the
lesion, prevent pathological bone fractures,
reduce relapse, and most importantly, stop
pain.1
This case report describes the aggressive
development of an ABC in a paediatric pa-
tient. Regardless of the initial treatment, the
outcome was unfavourable, which led to
use of a mega-prosthesis for replacing the
tumour.
Case presentation
We report a case of an 11-year-old girl who
presented to the Emergency Department for
diffuse pain of the left hip after a fall. Her
medical and family history was unremark-
able. A clinical examination showed mild,
diffuse swelling of the left hip. The swelling
was firm and non-tender, with moderate to
severe painful manipulation. This was asso-
ciated with pain-related decreased mobility
of the hip. The patient was unable to walk.
Plain radiography of the left hip in the fron-
tal and lateral views showed an extensive
osteolytic lesion in the proximal metaphy-
seal femur and femoral neck with thin scle-
rotic margins, with no invasion of the
growth plate (Figure 1). Magnetic reso-
nance imaging and a computed
Ulici et al. 539
tomography (CT) scan of the hip showed
the presence of an ABC in the proximal
third of the left femur, with no extension
in the adjacent soft tissue. Selective arterial
embolisation was performed to devascular-
ise the tumour, promote healing, and de-
crease the risk of high bleeding during the
biopsy procedure. For this purpose, absorb-
able gelatine sponge particles were used.
A biopsy was achieved through a lateral
approach centred on the greater trochanter.
A hole was drilled at the inferior pole of the
cyst, thus reaching the haemorrhagic lesion
where blood and cystic soft tissue were
obtained for a histopathological exam.
After the diagnosis was confirmed,
we performed a second selective arterial em-
bolisation to limit development of the ABC.
The patient's progress was favourable, with
decreased local pain, and she gradually
regained mobility.
One month later, local progression of the
ABC was favourable. Radiographic find-
ings showed osteosclerotic margins at the
tumour site. Pain in the left hip was further
diminished and the full range of motion was
regained. At the 8th and 12th weeks of
check-up, plain radiography was performed
and showed no progression of the bone
cyst. After approximately 16 weeks, the pa-
tient experienced moderate local pain. An
X-ray showed that the osteolytic process
was expanded (Figure 2). A second biopsy
was performed to exclude a potential malig-
nant diagnosis, which could have been
missed. A biopsy specimen was also sent
to another histopathological diagnosis
centre and the initial diagnosis was recon-
firmed (ABC vascular type). Furthermore,
progression of ABC was unfavourable.
Massive growth of the lesion had resulted
in total destruction of the proximal third of
the femur. The lesion expanded from the
growth plate to 1 cm distally of the lesser
trochanter, with severe local pain and func-
tional impairment. Three-dimensional CT

reconstruction showed massive destruction
of the proximal left femur (Figure 3).
Before surgical treatment, a CT scan
showed disappearance of the cortical wall
and differentiation of the cyst from the ad-
jacent soft tissue by a fibrous membrane.
We injected contrast agent to confirm
under fluoroscopy that the cystic walls
were breached. Unfortunately, the cyst
communicated with the surrounding soft
tissues. Therefore, sclerotherapy was
contraindicated.
Considering the fulminant evolution of
the lesion throughout 8 months (Figure 4),
we decided to perform radical treatment for
the tumour. We chose to excise the tumour
(Figure 5). We used a reconstructive
prosthesis of the proximal femur and total
hip arthroplasty. The resection was wide,
reaching approximately 2 cm distally to
the inferior pole of the cyst. The implant
had to insure the possibility of needing to
reinsert the local muscular structures. For
hip arthroplasty, we used a total unce-
mented prosthesis. The acetabular cup was
attached without a requirement for any par-
ticular preparation of the acetabulum.
At the 3rd week of follow-up, the
patient's recovery was favourable and pas-
sive movement of the left hip was regained.
Eight weeks later, the full range of motion
and full weight-bearing were achieved
(Figure 6). The 1-year follow-up showed
good progress with total recovery of func-
tion, no local pain, and total weight-bearing.
The patient provided verbal consent for
inclusion in this report. Approval for this
report from the ethics committee was not
required.
Discussion
Although the initial treatment of our pa-
tient was in accordance with surgical proto-
cols, development of the ABC was atypical.
In our case, there was rapid progression of
the lesion, leading to massive bone destruc-
tion. Acute pain experienced by the patient

was resilient to medication and there was
total loss of function.
Block resection has the best outcome and
the lowest rates of relapse for ABC, provid-
ing the best control over the lesion.
However, this method has the highest mor-
bidity rate because of intra- and
postoperative complications, such as mas-
sive haemorrhage, a high risk of infection,
post-resection persistent pain, shortening of
the limb, growth defects, and muscular hy-
potonia.13 Considering the high risk of local
complications associated with open sur-
gery,14,15 many surgeons choose less inva-
sive techniques, such as sclerotherapy and
embolisation.16,17
Embolisation is a minimally invasive
technique that devascularises the tumour.
Embolisation can promote healing of the
tumour and reduce intra- and postoperative
complications of open surgery, offering the
surgeon a better approach in cases of total
resection.18 Embolisation for ABC has a re-
currence rate of 39% to 44% associated
with cysts that are larger than 5 cm.
Repeated embolisation can have favourable
outcomes in recurrent lesions. In our case,
the lesion persisted and became more ag-
gressive, even though it had favourable pro-
gression for a while after repeated
embolisation. This finding is in contrast to
similar cases where repeated embolisation

of ABC led to a successful outcome.19,20
Rossi et al.8 showed that 102 patients with
ABC treated by selective arterial embolisa-
tion with N-2-butyl-cyanoacrylate had a
healing rate of 81.8% and a complication
rate of 4.5%. They also concluded that, to
be effective, this procedure must be per-
formed by an experienced practitioner
with good technical skills.
Sclerotherapy is a minimally invasive
therapeutic procedure for ABC with good
long-term results. This therapy slows devel-
opment of the cyst and also lowers the risk
of relapses. The most commonly used sub-
stances for sclerotherapy are Ethibloc,
9-Aetoxisclerol, doxycycline, pure alcohol
in a liquid or gel state, and liquid nitrogen.9
Considering the high risk of soft tissue ne-
crosis due to pure alcohol, this procedure is
not indicated in cases where imaging data
reveals a cortical break.21 In our case, three-
dimensional CT reconstruction indicated
cortical breakage, which was confirmed
intraoperatively by fluoroscopic imaging
after administrating a contrast-enhancing
agent.
With regard to the standard treatment
for ABC, reconstruction of the affected
area with a tumour prosthesis of the
femur and total arthroplasty of the hip is
infrequent. This method is reserved for ag-
gressive malignant tumours with a fulmi-
nant evolution. The reason for postponing
resection of the tumour mass is its location.
This situation is common and has specific
challenges.22
In paediatric patients, finding implants
that have the right size for the age group
is difficult. Additionally, development of a
discrepancy in lower limb length during
growth leads to a series of re-interventions
on the implant to elongate it.23,24 Because
of the small size of paediatric patients, they
would benefit from a custom-made endo-
prosthesis. Additionally, in pathologies
where removal of large portions of the skel-
etal structure is required, a customised
implant would be a possible solution.
Unfortunately, we do not have this thera-
peutic option in our clinic.
The system that we used in our patient
was a modular system that enabled the fem-
oral component to be extended.
Therapeutic management started with a
minimally invasive approach, attempting
to conserve the bone capital and trying to
avoid complications associated with open
surgical techniques. Successive embolisa-
tion excluded the possibility of using a vas-
cular bone graft because of insufficient
arterial sources for grafting. In our patient,
total arthroplasty of the hip was preferred
over bipolar hemiarthroplasty. The reason
for this is because, in paediatric patients,
occurrence of laminar coxitis is frequent,
and revision of the implant might be re-
quired in the near future with rehabilita-
tion.25 Dysplasia, which appears in the
remodelling phase, can produce supero-
external migration of the prosthesis and
muscular imbalance between the hip's
adductors and abductors.26 In a study on
111 patients who underwent total hip re-
placement before 20 years old, the 10-year
survival rate (without revision) was 70%,
and the complications of osteolysis and at-
rophy were observed.27
Conclusions
The therapeutic plan that was applied to
our patient was in accordance with the
latest treatment protocols of minimally in-
vasive techniques of embolisation.
However, the unfavourable outcome of
our patient led to block resection and pros-
thetic replacement as a final solution.
Repeated embolisation can achieve local
tumour control, even in ABCs that show
progression after the first embolisation.
However, in the present case, severe local
symptomatology and massive destruction
of the proximal third of the femur led to a
radical therapeutic approach.
Ulici et al. 543
Even though there is a standard treat-
ment protocol for ABC, which uses a min-
imally invasive procedure, treatment should
be individualised for each patient. This is
especially the case with aggressive local pro-
gression of the tumour that disturbs the
patient's function and quality of life for a
long time. A radical therapeutic approach
prevents the risks of local recurrence and
pathological fractures.
