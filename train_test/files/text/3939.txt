Dependence on a romantic partner is a necessary component
of well-functioning relationships; but dependence also car-
ries with it risks such as rejection, disappointment, and hurt.
Thus, individuals must balance relationship-promotion
goals, which foster closeness and interdependence, with self-
protection goals, which minimize the risk of hurt and rejec-
tion. Ironically, people who prioritize self-protection goals
are actually more vulnerable to eventual rejection compared
with those who prioritize relationship-promotion goals
(Downey, Freitas, Michaelis, & Khouri, 1998; Murray,
Griffin, Rose, & Bellavia, 2003; Stinson, Cameron, Wood,
Gaucher, & Holmes, 2009).
Risk regulation theory suggests that individual differ-
ences in mental representations of the self play an important
role in determining which goals are prioritized (Murray,
Holmes, & Collins, 2006). According to the theory, people
with negative self-models (NSMs)--who doubt their self-
worth and expect rejection--will tend to adopt a self-protec-
tive interpersonal style aimed at limiting the pain of
anticipated rejection (Cameron, Stinson, Gaetz, & Balchen,
2010). When threats are detected, they are likely to (a) ques-
tion their partner's acceptance, (b) internalize the threat (e.g.,
internal focus, internal attributions), and (c) reduce depen-
dence on their partner and their relationship. In contrast,
those with positive self-models (PSMs)--who are high in
self-worth and confidently expect acceptance from others--
are likely to adopt a more risky, relationship-promoting
interpersonal style aimed at fostering closeness with others
(Cameron etal., 2010). They are likely to respond to rela-
tionship threat by (a) increasing their confidence in their
partner's acceptance, (b) externalizing the threat (e.g., exter-
nal focus, external attributions), and (c) drawing closer to
their partner and their relationship.
Consistent with these assumptions, studies have shown
that people with NSMs respond to relationship threats by
defensively distancing from their partners (e.g., Collins,
1996; Collins, Ford, & Guichard, 2006; Downey etal., 1998;
Murray, Rose, Bellavia, Holmes, & Kusche, 2002). For
example, when dating participants were led to believe that
their partner found them to have many faults (a relationship
threat), those with low (vs. high) self-esteem felt less
accepted by their partner, rated their partner more negatively
on a series of interpersonal traits, and reported feeling less
close to their partner (Murray et
al., 2002; Study 3). In
another study, dating participants who were high (vs. low) in
attachment-related anxiety (who worry about being rejected
or unloved) responded to partner transgressions by making
more relationship-threatening attributions and reporting
behavioral intentions that were likely to weaken their rela-
tionship (Collins etal., 2006).
The goal of the current study was to examine one impor-
tant mechanism through which self-models regulate
responses to threat. Specifically, risk regulation theory posits

Self-Models and Relationship Threat:
A Test of Risk Regulation Mechanisms
Máire B. Ford1 and Nancy L. Collins2
Abstract
This study investigated a key claim of risk regulation theory, namely, that psychological internalizing of a relationship threat
will serve as a mediator of the link between self-models (self-esteem and attachment anxiety) and relationship responses
(moving closer to a partner vs. distancing from a partner). Participants (N = 101) received feedback that threatened their
current romantic relationship (or no feedback) and then completed measures of internal­external focus, relationship
closeness­distancing, and acceptance­rejection of the feedback. Results showed that participants with negative self-models
responded to the relationship threat by becoming more internally focused and by distancing from their partners, whereas
those with positive self-models became more externally focused and moved closer to their partners. Mediation analyses
indicated that the link between self-models and relationship closeness­distancing was partially explained by internal focus.

that the link between self-models and partner closeness/dis-
tancing following relationship threat should be mediated by
internalization/externalization of the threat (Murray et
al.,
2006). For those with NSMs, self-doubts and concerns about
rejection should lead them to focus on the implications of the
threat for their personal well-being (in an egocentric fashion)
and to look for internal explanations for the threat (for exam-
ple, locating the cause in a flawed self). Turning inward and
processing the threat from a self-immersed perspective
should then foster defensive distancing (Ayduk & Kross,
2010). In contrast, for those with PSMs, their confidence in
their worth and expectations of acceptance should lead them
to respond to relationship threat in a less egocentric and more
interdependent fashion and to look for external explanations
for the threat (perhaps locating the cause in external events).
Turning outward should allow them to maintain confidence
in their relationship and should promote movement toward
the partner. Although these theoretical claims have not been
tested within ongoing relationships, Ford and Collins (2010)
provided some initial evidence in a study of strangers in
which participants were exposed to an ambiguous rejection
from a potential dating partner. Participants with low (vs.
high) self-esteem made more internal, self-blaming attribu-
tions for the rejection, experienced greater cortisol reactivity
(a physiological indicator of self-threat), and were more
likely to derogate their interaction partner. Importantly, self-
blame attributions mediated self-esteem differences in corti-
sol reactivity and partner derogation.
It is important to investigate this same mediation process
in ongoing relationships, as risk regulation theory is primar-
ily designed to explain processes in relationships where
some degree of dependence on a partner has already been
established. Does this same mediation process explain defen-
sive distancing in ongoing relationships? To investigate this
question, we assessed two novel measures of internalizing­
externalizing responses to relationship threat, (a) implicit
self-focus (vs. other focus) and (b) self-conscious emotions
(e.g., guilt, shame). First, we reasoned that increased inter-
nalization would be revealed in heightened self-focus fol-
lowing a relationship threat. Self-focus involves a focusing
of attention inward (toward features of the self), rather than
outward (toward other people or toward the situation). Based
on risk regulation theory, individuals with NSMs (compared
with those with PSMs) should become more self-focused
following a potential relationship threat as they turn inward
to find an explanation for the event. To our knowledge, no
study has examined focus of attention following relationship
threat. Second, we reasoned that internalization would be
reflected in emotional responses to the threat. In particular,
we focused on self-conscious emotions, which are a set of
emotions triggered by a failure of the self or one's behavior.
Two closely related and frequently co-occurring self-con-
scious emotions are shame, which involves a negative evalu-
ation of the self, and guilt, which involves a negative
evaluation of one's behavior (Tangney, Youman, & Stuewig,
2007). According to social self-preservation theory, threats
to the social self (such as relationship threat) will evoke self-
conscious emotions as the focal emotional response
(Dickerson, Gruenewald, & Kemeny, 2004). This should be
especially true for those with NSMs who are more likely to
become self-focused following a social threat, resulting in
heightened awareness of their negative self-aspects and
increased self-blame for the social threat (Ford & Collins,
2010). In contrast, individuals with PSMs should be less
likely to turn inward and to blame themselves for the poten-
tial threat, and should be comparatively buffered from feel-
ings of shame or guilt. Importantly, for our study,
self-conscious emotions following threat are associated with
withdrawal and disengagement (to prevent further loss of
social self-esteem; Dickerson etal., 2004), as well as defen-
sive behavior (Tangney etal., 2007).
In summary, self-focused attention and self-conscious
emotions should go hand in hand as two important indicators
of internalization. These markers of internalization should,
in turn, help explain relationship-distancing behavior follow-
ing threat. To the extent that self-focused attention heightens
awareness of negative self-aspects and increases feelings of
shame and guilt for individuals with NSMs, they should be
likely to prioritize self-protection goals and distance them-
selves from their partner. In contrast, if individuals with
PSMs turn their attention outward in response to threat, they
should be less likely to experience self-conscious emotions
and more likely to view the threat in a broader, less self-
focused perspective that enables them to approach their part-
ner and to protect or enhance their relationship.
The Current Study
The primary aim of this study was to explore the role of psy-
chological internalizing of a relationship threat as a mediator
of the link between self-models and relationship responses.
To accomplish this aim, we conducted a two-part study.
During Session 1, participants completed measures of gen-
eral and relational self-models (self-esteem and attachment-
related anxiety). During Session 2, they were randomly
assigned to a "relationship threat" or a "no threat" condition
(described below). Cognitive and emotional responses were
then assessed.
We predicted that individuals with PSMs and NSMs
would respond differently to the relationship threat. Those
with NSMs should report more internalization as reflected in
increased self-focus and increased self-conscious emotions.
They should also move away from the partner following
relationship threat by derogating their partner, making pes-
simistic predictions for the future of their relationship, and
reducing closeness. In contrast, those with PSM should
report less internalization and more movement toward their
partner following relationship threat by maintaining positive
images of their partner, making optimistic predictions about
the future, and maintaining or increasing closeness. Finally,
Ford and Collins 3
we predicted that movement toward/away from the partner
would be mediated by differences in internalizing/external-
izing responses.
Method
Participants
Participants were 101 undergraduate students (65 females)
ranging in age from 18 to 24 (M = 18.6 years, SD = 1.0). All
were recruited from a large public university in California.
Sixty-nine percent of participants were White, 14% were
Asian/Pacific Islander, 9% were Latino/Hispanic, 2% were
Black/African American, and 6% were of a different race
than those listed. All participants were in a romantic relation-
ship for at least 3 months (M = 15 months, SD = 11.92). They
received US$15.00 or course credit for their participation.
Procedure
Session 1:Questionnaire session. Groups of one to four partici-
pants completed measures of general and relational self-
models (described below).
Session 2: Experimental session. One week later, participants
reported individually to the lab and were randomly assigned
to the relationship threat or no threat condition. To create a
relationship threat, we adapted a methodology used by Mur-
ray etal. (2002) in which participants completed a bogus
relationship scale and received false feedback. The question-
naire asked participants to rate how often their partner
engaged in various behaviors. There were 18 items that var-
ied by condition. In the threat condition, 13 items described
negative partner behaviors (e.g., "How often does your part-
ner seem emotionally distant?") and the remaining 5 items
described positive (e.g., "How often does your partner laugh
at jokes you make?") or neutral (e.g., "How often does your
partner discuss current events with you?") behaviors. In
addition, participants responded on a skewed response scale
that was anchored in a way that elicited high scores (responses
ranged from "never" to "a few times a month"). In the control
condition, 5 items were negative, 10 items were positive, and
3 items were neutral.
After completing the questionnaire, participants in the
relationship threat condition received false feedback. The
experimenter ostensibly scored the questionnaire and told
participants that their score was a "70" and that this score
was quite a bit higher than average. They were told that this
reflected a low level of involvement on the part of their
romantic partner and that over time this would be likely to
lead to disillusionment or dissatisfaction. Participants in the
control condition did not receive feedback.
All participants then engaged in a filler activity (labeling
states on a blank map) and completed the dependent measures,
including implicit self-focus and self-conscious emotions
(measures of internalization), ratings of the partner, predic-
tions for the future of the relationship and inclusion of the part-
ner in the self (measures of partner closeness/distancing), and
acceptance/rejection of the threatening feedback (the manipu-
lation check). Finally, participants were carefully debriefed.
Session 1 Measures of Self-Models
Self-esteem.Self-esteem was measured with the 10-item
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965;  = .93),
which assesses global self-evaluation (e.g., "On the whole, I
am satisfied with myself"). Participants rated each item on a
scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).
Attachment-related anxiety.
Because chronic attachment-
related anxiety and relationship-specific attachment-related
anxiety both play an important role in shaping responses to
relationship events (Collins, Guichard, Ford, & Feeney,
2004), we assessed both constructs. To measure chronic anx-
iety, participants completed a shortened (14-item) version of
the anxiety subscale of Brennan, Clark, and Shaver's (1998)
Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR) Scale, which
measures the extent to which a person is worried about being
rejected, abandoned, or unloved (e.g., "I worry about being
abandoned," "When others disapprove of me, I feel really
bad about myself"). Participants responded to each item on a
scale from 1 (not at all like me) to 7 (exactly like me) in terms
of their general orientation toward close relationships ( =
.94). The relationship-specific scale contained identical
items except that some items were re-worded to refer to the
current partner (e.g., "When my partner disapproves of me I
feel really bad about myself") and participants responded in
terms of their specific orientation toward their current rela-
tionship ( = .92). The chronic and relationship-specific
anxiety scales were strongly correlated with each other,
r = .837, p < .001.
Self-model. To achieve the most valid and reliable assessment
of self-models, we standardized and combined scores on
self-esteem, chronic attachment anxiety (reverse-coded), and
relationship-specific attachment anxiety (reverse-coded) into
a single index (average r = .68,  = .86), with high scores
indicating a more positive model of self. This composite self-
model variable allowed us to capture various facets of indi-
viduals' self-models, including general self-worth
(self-esteem), general self-worth in relationships (chronic
attachment anxiety), and self-worth in one's specific rela-
tionship with one's own romantic partner (relationship-spe-
cific). All three of these measures have been investigated as
important predictors of risk regulation processes (Collins,
1996; Jaremka, Bunyan, Collins, & Sherman, 2011; Miku-
lincer, 1998; Murray, Derrick, Leder, & Holmes, 2008; Over-
all & Sibley, 2009; Simpson, Rholes, & Phillips, 1996).
Rather than presenting the findings for each measure of self-
model separately, we will present findings in terms of this
4 SAGE Open
composite self-model variable to avoid complexity and space
issues. It should be noted that even when these variables are
investigated individually, the overall pattern of results is
comparable across the three measures.
Session 2 Dependent Measures
As mentioned previously, all dependent measures were
assessed following the delivery of the relationship threat
feedback (or no feedback, in the case of the control
condition).
Measures of internalization/externalization
Self-conscious emotions.Participants described how they
were feeling "right now" by rating a series of emotions on
a scale from 1 (very slightly) to 5 (extremely). For the cur-
rent investigation, we computed a two-item index of self-
conscious emotions (guilty, ashamed;  = .68).1
Implicit self-focus.
Participants completed a 12-item
implicit measure of self-focus based on a measure created
by Wegner and Giuliano (1980). Participants completed a
series of sentences by choosing among three pronoun alter-
natives, one of which was first-person singular (e.g., "The
noise got to us/them/me before long," "I/he/she spent the day
at the beach"). We computed an implicit self (vs. other) focus
score by computing the proportion of first-person, singular
responses chosen. Scores ranged from 0 to .667.
Composite measure of internalization. To provide the most
valid assessment of internalization, we created a composite
measure by standardizing and combining scores for self-con-
scious emotions and implicit self-focus. Although these two
variables were only modestly correlated (r = .18, p = .07),
the combined index enabled us to capture different facets of
internalization, thereby increasing the sensitivity of our mea-
surment.2 High scores indicate more internalization.
Measures of movement toward/away from the partner
Ratings of partner traits.Participants rated their roman-
tic partner on a series of positive and negative interpersonal
traits (adapted from Murray etal., 2002) using a scale from
1 (not at all characteristic) to 9 (completely characteristic).
We computed an eight-item index of positive partner evalu-
ations ( = .89; kind and affectionate, considerate, loving,
warm, understanding, tolerant and accepting, responsive,
and forgiving).
Predictions for the future. Participants were presented with
a series of positive and negative relationship events (adapted
from Murray etal., 2002) and were asked to predict how fre-
quently they thought each event would occur in the next 6
months, using a scale from 1 (rarely, if ever) to 7 (frequently).
We computed a six-item index of optimistic predictions ( =
.75; for example, "My partner will provide needed support if
I am feeling down," "I will be tolerant and generous if my
partner behaves badly.")5.
Inclusion of other in the self.Participants completed the
inclusion of other in the self scale (Aron, Aron, & Smollan,
1992), which is a pictorial measure of closeness consisting
of a series of progressively overlapping circles. Scores range
from 1 (non-overlapping circles, suggesting very little close-
ness) to 7 (highly overlapping circles, suggesting a great
deal of closeness). Participants chose the picture that best
represented their relationship.
Composite measure of movement toward/away from the
partner.A composite measure of partner closeness/distanc-
ing was created by standardizing and combining measures of
positive partner ratings, positive predictions for the future of
the relationship, and inclusion of other in the self ( = .67).3
High scores indicate increased closeness to the partner.
Measure of perceived partner involvement.Finally, partici-
pants responded to the question "How involved is your part-
ner in your relationship?" using a scale from 1 (much less
involved than average) to 7 (much more involved than aver-
age). This was the final item on the questionnaire and it was
intended to serve as a manipulation check and to measure the
extent to which participants in the relationship threat condi-
tion accepted the threatening feedback.
Results
Regression Analyses
To examine the effect of self-models on responses to rela-
tionship threat, we conducted moderated regression analy-
ses. We entered the main effects of self-model (continuous)
and experimental condition (0 = control, 1 = threat) on Step
1, and the Self-Model × Condition interaction on Step 2. To
follow-up on significant interactions, we computed simple
slopes and predicted means at ±1SD from the mean on self-
models (Aiken & West, 1991). As mentioned previously, we
predicted that the threat manipulation would move partici-
pants in different directions depending on their self-mod-
els--those with NSMs would become more negative/
pessimistic in the threat condition compared with the control
condition, whereas those with PSMs would become less neg-
ative (and more positive) in the threat versus control
conditions.
Perceived partner involvement (manipulation check).There
was no main effect of experimental condition ( = .008,
p = .930), a significant main effect of self-model ( = .349,
p < .001), and a significant Self-Model × Condition interac-
tion ( = .287, p = .049). As shown in Figure 1, there was no
association between self-models and perceived partner
Ford and Collins 5
involvement in the control condition ( = .131, p = .368),
but there was a significant association in the threat condition
( = .507, p = <.001); those with NSMs rated their partner as
significantly less involved than those with PSMs. These
findings indicate that those with NSMs tended to accept the
threatening feedback, whereas those with PSMs tended to
discount or reject it.
Composite measure of internalization.There were significant
main effects of experimental condition ( = .310, p < .001)
and self-model ( = -.441, p < .001), and a Self-Model ×
Condition interaction ( = -.855, p < .001). As shown in
Figure 2, the threat manipulation moved people in different
directions depending on their self-models. Participants with
PSMs reported less internalization in the threat (vs. control)
condition ( = -.249, p = .007), whereas those with NSMs
reported more internalization in the threat (vs. control) con-
dition ( = .879, p < .001). Viewed another way, in the threat
condition, those with PSMs reported less internalization rela-
tive to those with NSMs ( = -.913, p < .001), whereas in the
control condition, the opposite pattern was seen ( = .211,
p = .034).

Composite measure of movement toward/away from the part-
ner.There was no main effect of experimental condition
( = .076, p = .433), a significant main effect of self-model
( = .278, p = .005), and a significant Self-Model × Condi-
tion interaction ( = .424, p = .004). As shown in Figure 3,
participants with PSMs reported greater movement toward
the partner in the threat (vs. control) condition ( = .354, p =
.009) whereas those with NSMs showed an opposite (non-
significant) trend ( = -.206, p = .127). Viewed another way,
in the threat condition, those with PSMs (vs. those with
NSMs) reported more movement toward the partner
( = .512, p < .001), whereas in the control condition, those
with PSMs and NSMs did not differ in terms of the amount
of movement toward the partner ( = -.046, p = .752).
Mediation Analyses
We conducted a mediated moderation analysis to test whether
internalization of threat mediated the Self-Model × Condition
interaction on movement toward (or away from) the partner,
following procedures outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986)
and Hayes (2013). As summarized in Figure 4, prior analyses
revealed a significant Self-Model × Condition interaction
predicting both movement toward the partner (the outcome)
and internalization (the mediator). Internalization in turn, sig-
nificantly predicted movement toward the partner (b = -.326,
 = -.324, p = .03), and the original Self-Model × Condition
effect was no longer significant. This mediated (indirect)
effect was statistically significant as indicated by the boot-
strapped, bias-corrected confidence interval for the unstan-
dardized indirect effect (95% CI = [.1129, .5678]).4 Together,
these findings are consistent with the idea that movement
toward (or away from) the partner following threat is medi-
ated by internalization. Those with NSMs were more likely to
internalize the threat and were then more likely to move away
from (vs. toward) their partner. In contrast, those with PSMs
were less likely to internalize the threat and were then more
likely to move toward (vs. away from) their partner.

Supplemental Analysis
In a final analysis, we wanted to rule out the possibility that
the observed effects for self-models might reflect pre-exist-
ing differences in relationship quality. There was a modest
positive correlation between our self-model index and rela-
tionship satisfaction (r = .34, p = .001) indicating that those
with more PSMs were in happier relationships. Thus, it is
possible that the moderating effects of self-models were due
to differences in the quality of participants' relationships
rather than self-models per se. Therefore, we repeated all
analyses controlling for relationship satisfaction. The results
remained the same as those reported above. Only the interac-
tion effect for perceived partner involvement (our manipula-
tion check) changed from significant to marginal. Thus, the
observed findings for self-models cannot be explained by
differences in relationship quality.
Discussion
Findings from this study provide evidence for a key assump-
tion of risk regulation theory, namely, that internalization of
relationship threat is one important pathway through which
self-models motivate self-protection versus relationship-pro-
motion goals. In the current study, those with NSMs were
more likely to engage in responses reflecting internalization
(namely, focusing on the self and experiencing self-conscious
emotions) following relationship threat. These responses in
turn predicted distancing from the partner by rating the partner
less positively, making less positive predictions for the future
of the relationship, and reporting less closeness to the partner
on a measure of inclusion of the partner in one's sense of self.
Although this pattern of responses is motivated by self-protec-
tion concerns, it has been shown to paradoxically increase the
risk of being rejected by one's partner (Downey etal., 1998;
Murray, Bellavia, Rose, & Griffin, 2003). Thus, this pattern of
behavior has important implications for the interpersonal out-
comes experienced by individuals with NSMs.
Although most research on risk regulation has focused on
the vulnerabilities associated with NSMs, the current find-
ings highlight the importance of PSMs as a source of strength
and resilience in the face of relationship threat. These find-
ings confirm that the moderating effect of self-models on
responses to relationship threat are not simply fueled by the
harmful responses of those with NSMs (Murray, Griffin,
etal., 2003). When faced with a relationship threat, those
with PSMs do not simply avoid the downward, self-protec-
tive spiral of those with NSMs but rather they engage in
active coping responses to protect and even boost their rela-
tionship. Researchers should continue to identify the specific
relationship-boosting responses that those with PSMs engage
in following relationship threat, as well as the mechanisms
that lead to these responses.
In addition, the current findings underscore the impor-
tance of an external focus in response to relationship threat
and the benefits that a less egocentric point of view can
bring. Work investigating the benefits of an external focus
has largely been done in the context of participants recalling
an intense negative event (Kross & Ayduk, 2011). The cur-
rent study illustrates that for vulnerable groups, such as those
with NSMs, a less intense event (even a suggestion of a
threat to one's relationship) is enough to trigger an internal
focus and subsequent movement away from one's partner.
Perhaps if individuals with NSMs can be trained to focus
externally following a relationship threat and to engage in
reflection from a self-distanced perspective, they will avoid
the negative mental, physical, and interpersonal outcomes
(Ayduk & Kross, 2010; Finkel, Slotter, Luchies, Walton, &
Gross, 2013; Kross & Ayduk, 2011) associated with internal-
ization. Future work should investigate whether training
those with NSMs to take a less self-immersed perspective
following relationship threat can help them achieve better
interpersonal outcomes.
Although the current findings were largely consistent
with our hypotheses, a few unpredicted findings deserve
comment. First, our manipulation check (ratings of partner
involvement) did not show the expected main effect of con-
dition, but rather an interaction effect; participants with
PSMs defended against the threatening feedback by rating
their partner as more rather than less involved in the threat
(vs. control) condition. This finding is not entirely surpris-
ing. It is consistent with predictions of risk regulation theory
and with findings from other studies which show that people
with PSMs overestimate acceptance in risky social situations
(Cameron et
al., 2010; Murray et
al., 2002). Rather than
viewing this finding as a limitation, we view it as further
evidence of the tendency for those with PSMs to actively
defend their relationship against external threats by discount-
ing concerns about relationship threat and maintaining (and
even increasing) a sense of confidence in the relationship.
Finally, it is important to comment on a possible alterna-
tive interpretation of our findings. Might the current findings
reflect pre-existing differences between those with PSMs
and NSMs in terms of relationship quality? This is unlikely
given that in the absence of threatening feedback (in the con-
trol condition), those with PSMs and NSMs rated their part-
ners as equally involved. In addition, when we repeated all
analyses controlling for relationship satisfaction, the results
remained largely the same. Thus, we feel confident that the
observed effects for self-models do not merely reflect differ-
ences in the quality of the relationships in which those with
PSMs and NSMs reside.
Limitations and Future Directions
It is worth noting a few limitations to the current study. First,
as is often the case with laboratory studies of close relation-
ships, our sample was a college student sample. Thus, care
should be taken in generalizing beyond this sample to other
groups of individuals, such as older adults. Future studies

should test risk regulation processes in various age groups. In
addition, because our sample had a mean relationship length
of 15 months, care should be taken in generalizing these find-
ings to those in relationships of much greater length. Future
studies should investigate whether the interaction between
self-model and relationship threat affects internalization and
movement toward/away from the partner in a similar way for
those in relationships of greater length. It is possible that over
time, as partners grow more confident in each other's commit-
ment, those with NSMs are less likely to internalize threats
and subsequently less likely to distance from the partner. In
addition, it should be noted that all measurements in the cur-
rent study were self-report measures. Future work should use
more objective measures that are less prone to bias or to social
desirability effects. For example, behavioral measures of part-
ner distancing and physiological measures of internalization
could be incorporated into future work.
Finally, the current findings are based on a limited con-
ceptualization of internalization and movement toward/away
from the partner. Future work should incorporate additional
measures of internalization and movement toward/away
from the partner in tests of the mediational model investi-
gated here. For example, additional measures of internaliza-
tion may include rumination and reductions in state
self-esteem, and additional measures of movement toward/
away from the partner may include reductions in self-disclo-
sure to the partner and non-verbal signs of withdrawal/dis-
tancing. This would allow for a more complete understanding
of the specific pattern of responding that leads to better or
poorer relationship outcomes for those with positive and
NSMs.
Conclusion
The current findings provide empirical support for an impor-
tant assertion of risk regulation theory, namely that looking
inward following a relationship threat will motivate self-pro-
tective responses, and that looking outward will motivate
relationship-promoting responses. Because internalizing a
social threat has been associated with poor psychological
and physical outcomes (Dickerson, Mycek, & Zaldivar,
2008; Ford & Collins, 2010), our findings suggest that peo-
ple with NSMs may be at higher risk for negative personal
and interpersonal outcomes in response to social threat. In
contrast, those with PSMs are able to take life's lemons and
make lemonade by responding to threat in ways that increase
both personal and relationship well-being.
Notes
1. The alpha for this variable and for the composite measure of
movement toward/away from the partner fell just short of the
typical cutoff criteria of .70. However, both were, in fact, very
close to .70. It is likely that these alphas fell slightly short of
.70 because the scales were created by combining very few
items (two items in the case of self-conscious emotions and
three items in the case of movement toward/away from the
partner).
2. The low correlation between these two measures was not
entirely unexpected given that one was implicit and the other
was explicit (which are often weakly correlated). However, the
two variables together provide a better opportunity to capture
variance in internalization. It is important to note that analyses
conducted on the individual items and on the composite vari-
able yield the same general pattern of findings and the same
conclusions. However, the statistical results were slightly
stronger with the more robust composite than with the indi-
vidual items. Thus, our decision to combine items does not
alter the findings.
3. As with the internalization composite, it is important to note
that analyses conducted on the individual items for the com-
posite measure of movement toward/away from the partner
yield the same general pattern of findings and the same con-
clusions. Thus, our decision to combine items does not alter
the findings.
4. We conducted this test using the PROCESS macro in SPSS
(Hayes, 2013). We estimated Model 8 with 5000 bootstrap
samples. Bootstrap mediation tests are preferred over other
methods because they do not assume a normal sampling distri-
bution of the indirect effects (Preacher & Hayes, 2008).
5. It should be noted that we also included negatively valenced
items assessing ratings of partner traits and predictions for the
future. However, positive and negative items loaded on sepa-
rate factors and there were no significant findings for negative
items. It seems that relative to those with positive self-models
those with negative self-models were willing to endorse less
positive partner traits and less optimistic relationship predic-
tions following rejection. However, they were not willing to
go so far as to endorse more unambiguously negative partner
traits and pessimistic relationship predictions.
