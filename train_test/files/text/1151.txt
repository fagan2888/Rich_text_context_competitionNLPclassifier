ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION
Physician Consideration of Patients' Out-of-Pocket
Costs in Making Common Clinical Decisions
Hoangmai H. Pham, MD, MPH; G. Caleb Alexander, MD, MS; Ann S. O'Malley, MD, MPH
Background: Patients face growing cost-sharing through
higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket (OP)
expenses, with uncertain effects on clinical decision
making.
Methods: We analyzed data on 6628 respondents to the
nationally representative 2004-2005 Community Track-
ing Study Physician Survey to examine how frequently
physicians report considering their insured patients' OP
expenses when prescribing drugs, selecting diagnostic
tests, and choosing inpatient vs outpatient care settings.
Responses were dichotomized as always/usually vs some-
times/rarely/never. In separate multivariate logistic re-
gressions, we examined associations between physi-
cians' reported frequency of considering OP costs for each
type of decision and characteristics of individual physi-
cians and their practices.
Results: Seventy-eight percent of physicians reported rou-
tinely considering OP costs when prescribing drugs, while
51.2% reported doing so when selecting care settings, and
40.2% when selecting diagnostic tests. In adjusted analy-
ses, primary care physicians were more likely than medi-
cal specialists to consider patients' OP costs in choosing
prescription drugs (85.3% vs 74.5%) (P.001), care set-
tings (53.9% vs 43.1%) (P.001), and diagnostic tests
(46.3% vs 29.9%) (P.001). Physicians working in large
groups or health maintenance organizations were more
likely to consider OP costs in prescribing generic drugs
(P.001 for comparisons with solo and 2-person prac-
tices), but those in solo or 2-person practices were more
likely to do so in choosing tests and care settings (P.05
for all comparisons with other practice types). Physi-
cians providing at least 10 hours of charity care a month
were more likely than those not providing any to con-
sider OP costs in both diagnostic testing (40.7% vs 35.8%)
(P.001) and care setting decisions (51.4% vs 47.6%)
(P.005).
Conclusion: Cost-sharing arrangements targeting pa-
tients are likely to have limited effects in safely reducing
health care spending because physicians do not rou-
tinely consider patients' OP costs when making deci-
sions regarding more expensive medical services.

PATIENTS FACE GROWING COST-
sharing pressures through
new insurance benefit struc-
tures that limit coverage for
specific services.1-3 Cost shar-
ing is meant to offset payer expenditures
by shifting responsibility for costs of care
to patients and creating incentives for them
to reduce health care demand. However,
the complexity of clinical decision mak-
ing and information asymmetries be-
tween patients and physicians often pre-
vent patients from safely making decisions
about health care use on their own.4
Rather, as physicians' decisions affect how
90% of every health care dollar is spent,5
whether increased cost sharing can effec-
tively control health care spending de-
pends on whether patients and physi-
cians can together consider costs during
clinical decision making.6,7
The RAND Health Insurance Experi-
ment8 and subsequent studies9,10 have
raised concerns that patients facing higher
cost sharing tend to decrease use of both
necessary and unnecessary services, po-
tentially leading to worse health out-
comes. In particular, these studies sug-
gest that patients confronted with higher
out-of-pocket (OP) costs more often
choose to forego physician visits or care
that has been recommended by a physi-
cian (eg, filling a prescription or obtain-
ing an ordered mammogram).
Less evidence is available on how cost-
sharing arrangements affect clinical deci-
sion making during patient-physician in-
teractions. Patients and physicians often
do not discuss issues around OP costs,
which may be owing to embarrassment or
fear that the quality of care may be com-
promised.11-13 However, studies focused on
patient-physician communication have ex-
amined cost sharing generally rather than
comparing its effects on specific types of
health care services (eg, diagnostic test-
ing) and have explored only a limited num-
ber of physician and practice factors in re-

lation to whether OP costs affect clinical decision
making.12,14
Physicians serve as patients' agents, and increasingly
are called on to deliver patient-centered care.15 Thus, phy-
sician sensitivity to patients' OP costs might be hypoth-
esized to vary considerably based on several factors, in-
cluding the amount of clinical discretion allowed within
accepted practice standards for different types of deci-
sions; the magnitude of economic burdens their pa-
tients would face; and how invested physicians are in pa-
tient satisfaction, which may vary with physician and
practice characteristics.16,17 On the other hand, there are
reasons to hypothesize little variation in physicians' con-
sideration of OP costs, if most physicians lack detailed
data on their patients' insurance benefits, and both pa-
tients and physicians generally avoid the awkwardness
of discussing OP costs.
Although analyses of administrative claims may dem-
onstrate the impact of greater cost sharing on health care
utilization, such analyses have generally focused on phar-
maceuticals alone18,19 and have not captured the mecha-
nisms by which such changes take place, such as the de-
gree to which physicians actively consider patients' OP
costs. We analyzed data on how frequently physicians
reported considering their patients' OP costs from co-
payments and deductibles when prescribing drugs, se-
lecting diagnostic tests, and choosing care settings. We
also assessed the physician and practice characteristics
associated with this practice.
METHODS
DATA
The Community Tracking Study Physician Survey20 is a peri-
odic, nationally representative telephone survey of nonfederal
US physicians conducted 4 times since 1996. The sample is clus-
tered in 60 randomly selected metropolitan statistical areas and
includes physicians who report spending at least 20 hours in
direct patient care per week. Primary care physicians (PCPs)
(including those engaged in the practice of general internal medi-
cine, family practice, general practice, general pediatrics, geri-
atrics, and pediatrics/internal medicine) were oversampled, and
specialists such as radiologists, anesthesiologists, and patholo-
gists were excluded. Our analysis focuses on data from the 2004-
2005 survey,20 which included 6628 respondents with a re-
sponse rate of 53%. Other details about the survey and its design
have been previously published.20
MEASURES
Our outcome measures came from 3 questions of the form "How
often do you consider an insured patient's out-of-pocket costs
for copayments and deductibles" in (1) "prescribing a generic
over a brand-name drug if a generic option is available?" (2)
"deciding the types of tests to recommend if there is uncer-
tainty about a diagnosis?" and (3) "choosing between inpa-
tient and outpatient care settings, when there is a choice?" Phy-
sicians responded "always," "usually," "sometimes," "rarely,"
or "never." We dichotomized responses as always/usually vs all
other responses.
We selected these types of decisions because physicians face
different levels of discretion for each. That is, generic drugs are
nearly always equivalent to brand-name drugs in efficacy, while
different diagnostic tests or care settings may entail considerable
trade-offs in safety, convenience, or other factors. For example,
a physician trying to determine if a patient's chest pain is cardiac
in nature may order a simple treadmill stress test; a stress test with
an echocardiogram to visualize pump function; or a higher-risk
but more definitive cardiac catheterization. Similarly, a patient
withcommunity-acquiredpneumoniamaybeappropriatelytreated
as an outpatient or admitted to a hospital, depending on the pres-
ence of comorbidities, severity of the infection, and presence of
family or other support in the home.
We limited our inquiry to insured patients to isolate the ef-
fects of cost-sharing arrangements as distinct from those of po-
tentially much larger OP expenses that uninsured patients con-
front. The 3 questions underwent cognitive testing with a focus
group of physicians prior to survey fielding and were rotated
during survey administration.
Our main independent variables of interest were self-
reported physician and practice characteristics. Physicians' char-
acteristicsincludedyearsinpractice;specialty(PCPs,medicalspe-
cialists,andsurgeons);medicalschoolsite(UnitedStates,Canada,
or Puerto Rico, [hereinafter called "United States"] vs else-
where); board certification; sex; race or ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white, Hispanic, and all other); whether their compensation was
dependentonmeasuresofproductivityorpatientsatisfaction(yes
or no for each); what they perceived the overall effect of their fi-
nancial incentives to be (expand services at all vs reduce services
at all or no effect); and whether they agreed that they had ad-
equate time to spend with patients during office visits (agree
strongly or somewhat vs all other responses).
For the question on drug prescribing, we also included the
reported proportion of the physicians' patients covered by drug
formularies (25%, 25%-50%, 51%-75%, and 76% or more).
For the question on selecting diagnostic tests, we included phy-
sicians' reported ability to access referrals for high-quality di-
agnostic imaging and specialty care. And for the question on
selecting care settings, we considered physicians' reported abil-
ity to access elective hospital admissions for their patients (all
categorized as yes or no). Practice characteristics included type
(solo or 2-person group; groups 3; staff or group model health
maintenance organization [HMO]; hospital and/or university;
or other); percentage of revenues derived from Medicare and
managed care (each categorized by terciles); the number of man-
aged care contracts; and whether the practice had information
technology to access treatment guidelines. For the question on
drug prescribing, we also assessed whether physicians had ac-
cess to information technology in their practice to write elec-
tronic prescriptions.
We examined several other variables as proxy measures of the
socioeconomic status of physicians' patient panels: the number
of hours physicians reported providing charity care in the previ-
ous month (none, 1-4, 5-9, and 10 hours); the proportion of
practice revenue derived from Medicaid (terciles); the median
household income in the physician's practice ZIP code (quin-
tiles); and the proportion of adults 25 years or older in that county
who received 12 or more years of education (terciles).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We report herein the adjusted proportions of physicians who
reported having considered patients' OP costs by their indi-
vidual and practice characteristics. Adjustments were made using
separate multivariate logistic regressions for each of the 3 out-
come measures and included physician and practice charac-
teristics that were significant in bivariate analyses. We also ad-
justed for the reported proportion of each physician's patients
with a chronic condition as a measure of the illness burden
among his or her patients.

the survey's complex sampling strategy and known differ-

RESULTS
OP COSTS IN PRESCRIBING DRUGS
Most of the physicians (78.2%) reported regularly (al-
ways or usually) taking patients' OP costs into account
when prescribing generic over brand-name drugs. The
proportion of physicians routinely considering OP costs
in prescribing drugs varied by both individual physi-
cian and practice characteristics, although these differ-
ences were small. In adjusted analyses, PCPs were more
likely than medical specialists (85.3% vs 74.5% (P.001)
to regularly consider OP costs (Table 1).
Similarly, physicians in solo or 2-person practices were
less likely to always or usually take OP costs into ac-
count than physicians in HMOs (79.8% vs 89.8%)
(P.001) (Table 2). Of note, neither having access to
electronic prescribing nor the proportion of their pa-
tients covered by formularies was associated with phy-
sicians' reported frequency of considering OP costs in
choosing generic drugs.

OP COSTS IN SELECTING CARE SETTINGS
AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
In contrast, more than half (51.2%) of physicians re-
ported considering OP costs in choosing inpatient vs out-
patient care settings, and two fifths (40.2%) did so in se-
lecting diagnostic tests. As in decisions to prescribe generic
drugs, medical specialists were significantly less likely than
PCPs to routinely consider OP costs when selecting di-
agnostic tests (29.9% vs 46.3%) (P.001) and care set-
tings (43.1% vs 53.9%) (P.001) (Table 1).
However, several physician and practice characteris-
tics associated with considering OP costs for testing and
care settings differed from those associated with consid-
eringcostsfordrugprescribing.Physiciansinsoloor2-per-
sonpracticesweremorelikelytoconsiderOPcostsinchoos-
ingdiagnostictestsandcaresettingsthanphysiciansinother
types of practices. This association was independent of the
socioeconomic mix in the practice area and the illness bur-
den among a physician's patients (P.05 for all compari-
sons). There was no relation between practice revenue
sources and considerations of OP costs for decisions on di-
agnostic tests or care settings (Table 2).
Physicians' reported ability to access specific types of
services was also associated with their considering OP
costs. Physicians who were confident they could access
high-quality diagnostic imaging, but not specialist refer-
rals, were less likely than those who perceived worse ac-
cess to consider patients' OP costs in selecting diagnos-
tic tests (37.6% vs 42.1%) (P=.06). And physicians who
were confident that they could access elective hospital
admissions for their patients were less likely than those
who perceived worse access to consider OP costs when
selecting inpatient vs outpatient care settings (48.7% vs
54.8%) (P=.01) (Table 2).
PATIENT SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND OP
COSTS IN CLINICAL CARE DECISIONS
Physicians treating patients of lower socioeconomic sta-
tus tended to be more likely to consider OP costs. Phy-
sicians in the highest tercile of practice revenue derived
from Medicaid were more likely than those in the low-
est tercile (83.4% vs 77.4%) (P.001) to regularly con-
sider OP costs for drug prescribing (Table 1), while those
who provided at least 10 hours of charity care a month
were more likely than those providing no charity care to
consider OP costs in both diagnostic testing (40.7% vs
35.8%) (P.001) and care setting decisions (51.4% vs
47.6%) (P=.005) (Table 1).

We found no consistent association between physi-
cians' reporting adequate time to spend with patients dur-
ing office visits or their compensation structures and
whether they routinely considered patients' OP costs in
any of the 3 clinical situations.
COMMENT
Asinsurersandemployersseektocontrolhealthcarespend-
ing in the postÂ­managed care era, patient cost sharing is
likelytoremainaprominenttoolforinfluencinghealthcare
utilization. How well this works depends in part on phy-
sicians' sensitivity to their patients' OP costs, because phy-
sicians are responsible for decisions that affect how 90%
of each health care dollar is spent.5 We found that while
most physicians reported routinely considering patients'
OP costs in clinically straightforward prescribing deci-
sions, only half or fewer do so in more complex situations
that allow greater clinical discretion.
Our survey was conducted in 2004-2005, several years
afteremployersandinsurersembarkedonthecurrenttrend
of "benefits buy-down" through expanding consumer co-
payments and deductibles.1,3 We found that, despite the at-
tendant increases in cost-sharing burdens over that time
period, most physicians did not take them into account
when making common care recommendations surround-
ing diagnostic testing and choosing care settings.
To our knowledge, prior studies have not compared
physicians' sensitivity to patients' OP costs for different
services. The variation across different types of clinical
decisions that we document is not unexpected. The wider
clinicallatitudeinvolvedinmorecomplexdecisionsmeans
that physicians may prioritize other considerations, such
as accuracy of a test or ease of scheduling, above pa-
tients' OP costs as they approach these types of choices.
And physicians and patients are less likely to have ready
access to detailed cost data for diagnostic tests or care
settings than for prescription drugs.
Nevertheless, that physicians report considering pa-
tients' OP costs less frequently in making decisions about
more expensive services suggests that cost-sharing ar-
rangements dependent on patients and physicians weigh-
ing such costs can have only limited effect on use of such
services and, by extension, less impact on overall health
care spending than payers might hope for.
We also found that specialists were modestly more re-
sistant to OP costs than primary care physicians. This find-
ing was consistent across all 3 types of care decisions and
maybeduetoanumberoffactors.First,PCPsmaybemore
sensitivethanspecialiststopatients'economicburdens,per-
haps because of more continuous care relationships and
knowledge of patients' social circumstances that would fa-
cilitate discussing sensitive topics.21,22 Second, some spe-
cialist physicians are more likely to perform many types
of diagnostic procedures including through self-referrals,
which may create perverse disincentives for them to con-
sider patients' cost burdens in selecting individual tests, al-
though we did not find specific evidence that physicians'
financial incentives affect consideration of patients' OP
costs.23,24 Third, it is possible that specialists may perceive
less discretion in decision making if they responded to the
survey thinking in particular of patients within the pur-
view of their individual specialties who may have more se-
vere illness than similar patients treated by PCPs.25 Re-
gardless of the mechanisms, these specialty differences
compound concerns that cost sharing will have limited ef-
fects on the use of more expensive medical services.
Outside of comparisons of academic medical centers vs
community-based practices, few studies have examined
practice type differences in decisions regarding specific ser-
vices.12 We found that physicians in closed-model HMOs
are most likely to consider OP costs in drug prescribing
while those in solo or 2-person practices are most likely to
do so in recommending diagnostic tests and care settings.
One potential explanationmay be thatphysicians inHMOs
are more likely than those in other practice settings to have
ready access to information on copayments for formulary
vs nonformulary drugs to which they can refer during pa-
tient encounters.26 In contrast, similar decision aids for
choosing diagnostic tests or care settings are unlikely to
be as available or straightforward to use, given the greater
clinical latitude involved in these types of decisions. In this
context, the strength of individual patient-physician rela-
tionships that support communication about sensitive eco-
nomic issues may become more important determinants
of whether physicians consider cost burdens. Although in
prior research both patients and physicians report that in-
adequate time is a barrier preventing greater communica-
tion about OP costs,12 in the present study we did not find
an association between physician's reports of having ad-
equate time to spend with patients and physicians' rou-
tinely considering OP costs.
Our finding that physicians who reported worse ac-
cess to high-quality imaging services and elective hos-
pital admissions were more likely to consider OP costs
in selecting tests and care settings is intuitive. It sug-
gests that cost-sharing arrangements will have their great-
est effects where the supply of the relevant services is al-
ready constricted, providing further motivation for
physicians to weigh their costs against their benefits and
the time patients would spend waiting to access them.
The tendency toward greater consideration of OP costs
among physicians treating patients with lower socioeco-
nomic status is also expected. Lower-income insured
Americans are more likely than the wealthier insured to
have high OP health care spending burdens relative to
their family incomes.3 Physicians may either intuit this
or make assumptions about the relationship between pa-
tients' cost burdens and their socioeconomic status. But
as more patients face cost-sharing arrangements, such pre-
conceived notions of which patients are most vulner-
able could grow less reliable.
Our results should be viewed in light of several limi-
tations. We examined only 3 types of clinical decisions.
Physicians may consider OP costs more or less fre-
quently in other clinical situations, especially those in-
volving even higher-cost or higher-risk services such as
surgical procedures. Social desirability bias in a tele-
phone survey may also result in underestimation or over-
estimation of physicians' likelihood of considering pa-
tients' cost burdens, although we carefully worded
questions on diagnostic testing and care settings to avoid
implying a normative response. (We expect physicians

Itisdifficulttojudgetheaccuracyofself-reportedmea-
sures of physicians' decision-making processes, although
physiciansaccuratelyinterpretedthequestionsduringcog-
nitive testing, and we observed a reasonable distribution
of responses. Similarly, because survey items asked about
physicians' overall experience, we cannot address the in-
fluence of OP cost considerations on decision making in
individual care encounters. Further research may clarify
whetherphysiciansmaybemoresensitivetocostburdens
experiencedbyparticularpatientsubgroupssuchasthose
exposed to "doughnut holes" and varying copayments vs
deductibles.19,27 Finally, our results do not address the ef-
fectsofcostsharingoncaredecisionsthatpatientsmaymake
outside of their interactions with physicians, for example,
by foregoing recommended therapy.9,10,28
More aggressive interventions such as accessible, de-
tailed, and user-friendly information on costs of specific
services might broadly change physicians' clinical deci-
sion making,29 but only if they result in a significant im-
provement in how often and how well patients and phy-
sicians communicate with one another about cost burdens.
To evaluate the impact of such efforts, policymakers will
need to track physicians' sensitivity to patients' OP costs
over time, particularly for costly, discretionary services.
How such clinical decisions are made at the point of care
is critical to the viability of cost-sharing arrangements as
acost-controltooland,asimportantly,totheoverallhealth
and economic burden they pose to patients.
