Introduction
According to Oxford Dictionary, music is "vocal or instru-
mental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce
beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion." Alain
Daniélou (2003) defines music as "the more or less pleasing
effect that correlated sounds produce on our ears" (p. 49).
These definitions hint at three main ingredients of music,
namely, correlated sounds or sonic whole, expression, and
beauty. Each musical note in a melody must have a distinctive
relation with the preceding and succeeding notes. At the bot-
tom line, all the musical notes of a melody, while acquiring
meaning and becoming expressive from their relation to the
tonic, make up a "form" worth appreciating. This conceptual
article studies the ways and means through which emotions
are expressed in Hindustani Raga-Sangita, and how the "beau-
tiful," or "rasa," is created and experienced. "Rasa" is under-
stood, literally, as "juice," "sap," or "flavor." When applied to
art, rasa connotes the idea of relishing aesthetically.
Problem Statement
It is commonly taken for granted by many students of Indian
music, especially those studying Hindustani Raga-Sangita,
that the mere singing or playing of the musical notes and the
emanating melodies correctly with regard to the technical
and grammatical aspects of the art-form are enough to create
the aesthetic. This problem has led to two main wrong prac-
tices among those learners, namely, (a) mugging up of all
musical materials that have the potential to create the "beau-
tiful," thus discarding completely personal creativity and
innovation, and (b) producing the formal structure of a
music, albeit improvised and grammatically correct, but
dreary, inexpressive, and unaesthetic.
Purpose of Inquiry and Inquiry
Questions
This article is intended to throw light on the fact that not
only correct singing or playing of the tonal phrases and
melodies but also personal creative inputs and expression
of emotions are crucial to creating and performing good
music. This is an aspect of the rich musical tradition that

A Reflection on the Aesthetics of Indian
Music, With Special Reference to
Hindustani Raga-Sangita
Santosh Kumar Pudaruth1
Abstract
Like in any other heteronomous art-forms, the practitioners of Indian music and dance (Bharatiya Sangita) aim at expressing
emotions and creating the aesthetic or the "beautiful." Indian thinkers and musicologists have gone a step further in declaring
that Indian classical music (Raga-Sangita) is the most appropriate means for attaining aesthetic experience and delight, and
the most suitable pathway, if not, downright, short-cut, toward self-realization or realization of the Ultimate Reality or
Truth. Thus, aesthetics and spirituality make up the very woof and warp of the Indian arts, in general, and Raga-Sangita, in
particular. Raga-Sangita is, thus, considered a spiritual exercise (nada sadhana) to attain salvation (moksha) through sound.
This conceptual article reflects upon and sheds light on the Theory of Rasa, as propounded in Indian Aesthetics, and attempts
to make an assessment of it in relation to Hindustani Raga-Sangita. Through this theory, the author examines and explains the
different causes leading to an aesthetic experience, referred to as "out-of-this-world" (alaukika). In doing so, he also brings
to light the possible pitfalls which both the performer and the listener should avoid.

not only learners but also teachers in many music educa-
tion institutions tend to ignore.
This study ventures to answer the following questions:
What kind of music is there in the Hindustani musical tradi-
tion having the most potential characteristics to lead to the
experience of "rasa" or the aesthetic? What could be the
causes (necessary and sufficient causes) leading to rasa expe-
rience in this system of music? What are the prerequisites for
and obstacles which subvert the experience of rasa in this
system of Raga-Sangita?
Significance of the Inquiry
This academic venture is significant, as it tends to inform
students as well as teachers of Indian music of the impor-
tance of creating a music that is not only grammatically right
but also aesthetically profound and emotionally enriching.
Such an awareness will inform and affect positively teaching
and learning strategies and approaches.
Theoretical and Conceptual
Framework
This submission talks about music, as a means of commu-
nication, and its aesthetics, and not just as mere rendering
of tones and melodies, learnt from cramming, albeit with
some accuracy. A music performance must have the capac-
ity to not only satisfy the intellectual aspirations of the lis-
teners but also "touch their hearts" and uplift them from
the weariness of their ordinary lives. The theory that is best
suited to explain the necessary and sufficient causes con-
ducive to aesthetic experience of the highest kind is the
Rasa Theory, as propounded by sage-priest Bharata in his
Natyashastra, a Sanskrit treatise on drama, and developed
by the rhetorician and Kashmir Shaivite philosopher,
Abhinavagupta in his Abhinavabharati. Bharata rightly
says in the sixth chapter "Rasadhyaya" that "no meaning-
ful idea is conveyed, if `rasa' is not evoked"1 (p. 105). This
theoretical framework is supported by a conceptual frame-
work, which encompasses ornamentations, embellish-
ments, improvisation, and emotional expression, as defined
in Indian musicology.
Aesthetics as a Field of Inquiry
Aesthetics discusses what is beautiful, interesting, exciting,
uplifting, and entertaining in such art-forms as music, paint-
ing, drama, sculpture, literature, and dance, among others. In
a general way, depending on the nature of the art-forms, the
"beautiful" is experienced through any one, two, or more of
the five senses of perception. In music, the aesthetic, or
"rasa," is experienced directly through, primarily, the sense
of hearing and, at most, the sense of sight, in a disinterested
contemplative manner.
Indian Music and Dance (Bharatiya
Sangita)
The arts of singing, playing musical instruments, and danc-
ing, collectively designated as "Sangita," are regarded as the
main assets and expressions of Indian culture. These art-
forms, in all their diverse genres, styles, and forms, are
among the living traditions of the Indians and the Indian
Diasporas, and are practiced, promoted, and perpetuated
with much enthusiasm and earnestness.
Indian music comprises within its fold a vast, varied, and
rich tradition of classical, semiclassical, light, and folk
music, which has grown out of the different cultures and sub-
cultures of India and their mutual sharing. The focus of this
article is on Hindustani Raga-Sangita, or classical music
based on raga singing, as practiced in the northern part of
India.
Three Pillars of Raga-Sangita: Raga
(Melodic Matrix), Tala (Rhythmic
Cycle) and Pada (Lyrics)
"Raga" and "Tala" are the two unique and essential concepts
that Indian music, be it South Indian or Carnatic Music, or
North Indian or Hindustani Music, has given to the world
(Gautam, 1980). Pada, or lyrics, however, though being
important in vocal music, is reckoned as extramusical by
many musicologists and musicians.
Raga
Raga, as it is understood in the Indian musical tradition, does
not have its exact equal in other musical practices of the
world. Raga "is the soul of our (India's) musical system"
(Srinivasan, 1999). Gautam (1980) says, ". . . Indian music,
despite the constant influence of European music on it for the
last hundred years or more, has still maintained its unique
individual identity. That is basically because of its raga and
tala system" (pp. 24-25). Hence, one can say that the Indian
raga system is so deep-rooted in the musical ethos of the
connoisseurs that it will, undoubtedly, stand the test of time
and the onslaught of change, and escape erosion of its very
existence in India and elsewhere.
Several definitions have been put forth by both music
practitioners and scholars. Very often, raga is defined as a
combination of notes or group of notes that can be sung or
played. In short, raga is a melody. A raga is a scale. Raga is
also defined as a melodic scheme, which has the capacity to
color or please the mind of the listener. All these definitions
are not satisfactory, for they are partially true and overly
simplistic.
Matanga, the author of Brihaddesi, defines raga as "the
peculiar order of sounds which is decorated, beautified or
adorned with swara (note) and varna (order or movement)
Pudaruth 3
and is pleasing to the listener."2 Fox Strangways defines
raga as
an arbitrary series of notes characterized as far as possible as
individuals, by proximity to or remoteness from the note which
marks the Tessitura (general level of melody); by a special order
in which they are usually reinforced by a drone.3
From these, it can be understood that a raga is, fundamen-
tally, a specific melodic configuration produced out of a
group of notes rendered systematically and beautifully.
Swami Prajnanananda states that "a raga is a psycho-mate-
rial object as it is an objective expression of the subjective
feeling of the mind."4 "Expression" here refers to that "extra"
which an artiste adds to and renders in her or his perfor-
mance, over and above the fixed form, along with the out-
ward manifestation of notes and their prerequisites, to project
her or his psychological and emotional states. Expression
implies freedom, for there can be no expression without indi-
vidual freedom and creativity.
The definition put forth by Saxena (2009b) brings more
clarifications to the above-stated and thus more lucidity to
the understanding of the concept of raga. He states,
A raga is a specific--and (in a way) living--melodic form which
serves to permit and determine, as a matrix, the creation and
contemplation of music on the basis of the quality, emphases
and relatedness of tones, as also with the help of rhythmic
abidance or passage, possibly with an eye to evoking an
appropriate rasa, but always in accordance with one's individual
capacities for technical handling and grasp, visualization, and
aesthetic sensitiveness. (Saxena, 2009b, emphasis in original;
2010, p. 77)
Raga is a "living" form whereby the notes, the parts, are inte-
grated into a whole and follow a one-after-another or a
before­after order. The notes are arranged in a particular
order in a scale and are related as higher or lower to one
another. Besides, two specific notes out of the group of notes
must have mutual accord (samvada) and are given more
prominence, thus bringing inner unity to the raga. Being cre-
ated from the ascending and descending passages of notes, a
raga is constituted of an inner pulse. On account of the latter,
a raga can be viewed as a living form having movement and
coordination among its parts, in short, sharing some features
of life. Each raga has a distinct perceptible character of its
own though two different raga-s can have the same notes. A
raga is a matrix of melody, from whose material and restric-
tive or permissible principles, an infinite number of melodies
can be created.
Tala
Tala or Talam is the other edifice on which Indian music, in
general, stands. Tala refers to a rhythmic cycle on which a
song, an instrumental piece, or a dance is based or set. Just
like raga-s comprise notes, tala-s are constituted of beats.
Tala is demonstrated time in music, for being the latter's
temporal metric. Tala, thus, is a specific rhythmic arrange-
ment of beats to maintain time in music in a cyclic manner.
Each cycle is complete in itself and is repetitive. A tala may
have different sections of equal or unequal number of beats.
In Hindustani Raga-Sangita, each tala has a specific "theka,"
or rhythm signature, a group of basic mnemonic syllables by
which the tala can be identified and recognized.
Pada
Besides raga and tala, the two essential concepts of Indian
music, pada, or literature, or language also has its impor-
tance and unique place in this art-form, especially in vocal
music, in all genres, forms, and styles. Pada can be construed
as follows: (a) metrical or nonmetrical lyrics of vocal music,
which are meaningful; (b) sets of syllables or mnemonics
used to identify strokes of certain musical instruments, or
sets of meaningless syllables used in songs (e.g., Tarana and
alap of Dhrupada); and (c) a specific metrical structure with
a refrain (e.g., Jayadeva's Gita Govinda). All the three cate-
gories are used in Indian music, in general, whereas in Khyal
and Dhrupada compositions, the two main genres of
Hindustani Raga-Sangita, the first and third categories, are
more predominant (Chaudhary, 1986).5
A bandish, or cheez, is a well-knitted composition which
synthesizes the key features of a raga, the gait and beat pat-
tern of a tala, and the meaning and linguistic beauty of a text
or lyrics. Saxena (1981, p. 145) refers to bandish as a "dis-
tinct incarnation" or "avatara" of a raga. Each bandish or
composition is a distinct incarnation of a particular raga
which, if properly composed, has the potential to unveil the
latter's diverse facets and aesthetic characters.
Unlike the "general" poems, pada or lyrics used in music
is composed specifically for a raga and tala by a well-versed
and competent "musician-poet-composer," referred to in
ancient musical treatises as a vaggeyakara. As per the latter's
definition given by Sharangdeva in his Sangitaratnakara, a
composer must not only be a performer but must also have
knowledge and skill pertaining to grammar, music theories,
aesthetics, languages, patterns of rhythm, and sound used in
poetry, among others.
There are divergent views with regard to the importance
of text in Indian music, especially Hindustani Raga-Sangita.
Pt. Vidyadhar Vyas, the renowned Khyal exponent of Gwalior
Gharana, affirmed that wordings of a composition are like
"pegs on which notes are hung." The words of the text in a
bandish act, merely, as aids to enable delineation of the
notes, musical phrases, and tonal features of the raga. Nair
(2007) aptly brings out this idea and the gist of current prac-
tices by stating,
. . . a Khyal singer's emphasis does not fall on the words of the
composition nor, many a time, on the literary or semantic content
4 SAGE Open
(there are exceptions). Rather s/he focusses on the melodic
possibilities that can be unleashed using the vowel and phonemic
possibilities in words and clusters of well-chosen phrases from
the bandish. (p. 19)
Saxena (2010), on the contrary, stresses on the idea of "pure
music or music alone" which "eschews both languages and
beats organized as rhythm-cycles (tala), and which can yet
be very expressive and generally winsome" (p. 70). He quali-
fies alap of the Dhrupada genre as "pure" music which is
"free from admixture with what is not absolutely essential to
this art, that is, language and beat-measured rhythm (or tala)"
(Saxena, 2010, pp. 70-71). The phrase "not absolutely essen-
tial" makes more explicit the idea that lyrics is important, but
not necessarily crucial for enabling appreciation of good
Hindustani Raga-Sangita and aesthetic experience of the
highest type. In this sense, very often, literature or pada has
been considered as "extramusical." Saxena (2010) goes to
the extent of saying that language, if not rendered correctly,
can even damage a graceful musical passage and its flow
because of its "diversity of letters" and syllables and "their
varying volumes." To the question what makes pure music,
for example, alap of the Dhrupada genre; expressive and
capable of aesthetic appeal; the tunefulness of the notes and
musical passages; the evocative and contemplative pace and
manner of the singing; the aesthetic effects of profundity,
serenity, continuity, and grandeur produced from the raga
and its potential for delineation; the judicious and correct use
of the ornamentations; the voice production of the singer;
and the different emotions evoked, among others; in short,
the overall raga "form"6 of the alap-singing have been given
as some of the causal factors, both necessary and sufficient,
for aesthetic experience.
Form, Melodic Form and Musical Form
The term "form" is derived from French "forme" and Latin
"forma," which means shape or an appearance. The term
"form" in daily life refers to "shape," for example, round
shape or appearance, but this definition is not so appropriate
to explain the main characteristics of "form" in arts.
In art and aesthetics, the term "form" (in singular) refers
to an organization of interrelated, diverse materials whereby
each material heightens the significance of the other materi-
als (Saxena, 2011). Form is, thus, a "distinct whole of agree-
ably related parts" (Mittal, 2000). Form exhibits both unity
and variety.
Bourriaud (1998), rightly, defines form as an "indepen-
dent entity of inner dependencies." All the different features,
or elements of an art-work, when put together, construct a
coherent unity or structure and that unity or structure is
referred to as "form." Form is, thus, the whole and that whole
is made up of parts. It is the form, the whole, and not the
distinctive parts, which determines how the art-work "looks,"
and how it is given to one who perceives and appreciates it.
Form in Indian music and dance is apprehended through sen-
sory experience and imagination, and is the object of aes-
thetic contemplation and delight.
A raga is said to be a specific melodic form, which acts as
a matrix of melody, as it is formed from, among others, the
notes, the predominance of one of them, the unity among
them, the importance of some as compared with others, their
interconnectedness (consonance) and harmony, the avoid-
ance of some other notes (dissonance), their before­after
order and higher­lower order, their depth and proportion,
and the pace or tempi at which they are used (Saxena, 2010).
It is a form, as it is an integrated, organized complex, and a
melodic form, as the notes follow a before­after order, which
is more vertical than horizontal, given the ascending and
descending order of its notes. It is a specific melodic form in
the sense that each raga is different from one another. It is a
matrix of melody, as it permits the creation of an unlimited
number of melodies (Mittal, 2000). This specific melodic
form (raga) is fundamental in Indian classical music, as there
is form even in alap and any other type of unbound (anibad-
dha or manodharma) music as well.
The term "forms" (in plural) refers to musical structures
and their varieties, which are made up, basically, of the three
main elements, namely, melody (raga), rhythm (tala), and
poetry (pada). These musical structures are called musical
forms or bandish-s. Given this, it is noteworthy that a musi-
cal form is also a form (in singular), for it is also a formal
unity (Saxena, 2011). The different musical forms refer to
such genres as Khyal, Dhrupada, Tarana, Thumri, and
Ghazal, among others. As these are also formal unities of
raga and tala, they can be considered as "forms with forms"
(Mittal, 2000).
It is through its form that a piece of music acquires its
uniqueness, individuality, and, more importantly, its beauty.
Aesthetic experience arises from the contemplation of the
created form, and when that form is accessible and accept-
able to perception and imagination of a rasika or connois-
seur, it is reckoned as "the beautiful."
According to musicologists and aesthetic thinkers, art
may not be a thing of beauty or something which is appealing
to the eyes. It is rather the expression of form that an artist/e
can create. An art-object may not be beautiful, but it must
have a form or a coherent structure (Mittal, 2000; Saxena,
2010).
Indian Aesthetics
Indian Aesthetics is unique insofar as it hovers around and is
understandable through the theory of "rasa." Indian aesthet-
ics examines the capacity of music, or any art-form such as
drama and dance, to transmit, and stimulate or induce an
emotional state in the performers and educe the same state in
the contemplators or connoisseurs, or "rasika-s," as they are
called in Sanskrit. This emotional state expressed through
these arts, according to the theory, is experienced as "rasa."
Pudaruth 5
The experience of "rasa," which can also be translated as
"aesthetic consciousness," "feeling par excellence," or "sub-
limated emotion,"7 is different from one's daily experiences
of emotions such as anger, love, compassion, joy, and sor-
row. According to Bharata, the experience of these mental
predispositions or basic emotions is either pleasant or
unpleasant in ordinary real life, but when these are experi-
enced (rasanubhava) through complete identification or
absorption (tanmayi bhavana) with any art-works, they are
experienced, invariably, as delight, bliss, rapture, or ecstasy
(ananda). The essence of rasa is enjoyment and such enjoy-
ment is experienced as long as its stimuli continue. Such an
experience of delight, which cannot be expressed in words or
grasped by the mind,8 comes in a flash and is akin to the
delight of knowing or experiencing God (brahmananda
sahodara).9
Most thinkers agree that it is the aesthetic experience
(rasanubhuti) which a person, with the right aesthetic atti-
tude, experiences through arts which brings her or him nearer
to self-realization or emancipation from the shackles of the
egocentric impulses. Through the arts, one can have a fore-
taste of freedom from the limited self and a motivation to
transcend it. However, the right aesthetic attitude consisting
of an absence of all interests in practical life, which implies a
kind of distancing or detachment (vairagya) from all the
practical needs of life and a complete identification with the
work of art and/or the artiste, is required, hence paving the
way for experiencing "universalization" (sadharanikarana)
instead of "personalization." This is what thinkers could
have implied when they explained aesthetic experience as
"to become one" with the object of art.
In the words of Saxena (2009a), aesthetic experience does
disconnect the art experiencer (rasika) from the "spatio-tempo-
ral awareness and utilitarian interests" of his everyday life. The
locus of rasanubhuti is the experiencer's mental state of "imag-
inative self-identification" or universalization with the work of
art and its inherent emotion. Gautam (1988) affirms that such
an experience is an integrated and an indivisible one. It is self-
luminous, as it does not require any mediator for its knowledge.
It comes as a flash of delight. It is ecstatic in nature and is very
much akin to a spiritual experience. In this experience, there is
no distinction among knower, known, and knowledge. It is an
intuitive experience, hence an immediate one. Such an experi-
ence has been compared with the bliss of self-realization as,
first, there is no dichotomy between knower and known, and,
second, there is no egocentric consciousness. The experience is
transcendental and supra-mundane in nature. It can be experi-
enced or relished by someone who is sensitive to beauty, thus
not given to everyone. In fact, aesthetic experience is the enjoy-
ment of "one's (own) being, as an intrinsic, indivisible aspect
of one's self" (Saxena, 2009a). Notwithstanding its similarity
to spiritual experience, Saxena (2009a) puts forth a note of cau-
tion. Although aesthetic experience is considered as "akin to
the bliss of self-realization," it does not bestow self-realization.
At its best, it can release the rasika temporarily from the
vicissitudes of her or his life because of the emergence and
experience of pure "happiness with absolute peace . . ." But as
soon as this beatitude of aesthetic experience subsides, the indi-
vidual returns to her or his usual state of dichotomy between
herself or himself and the world.
Creativity and Expression in Hindustani
Raga-Sangita
Raga-Sangita consists of delineating a raga or melodic matrix
through singing, or playing of a musical instrument, while
developing and expanding its hidden tonal potentials and char-
acteristic features with a view to evoking emotions in the
minds of the listeners, hence paving the way for the experience
of rasa and delight. This is achieved by rendering two kinds of
music, namely, nibaddha (bound) and anibaddha (unbound).
These two concepts denote composition and improvisation,
respectively.
As mentioned earlier, a composition or bandish refers to a
well-knitted, structured musical form set to a specific
melodic form (raga) and rhythmic cycle (tala) having a text,
lyrics, or poetry. There is a large plethora of compositions in
Hindustani Raga-Sangita. The focus of discussion in this
article is on the two main classical musical forms, namely,
Dhrupada-Dhamar and Khyal. These are not only musical
forms or compositions but also two different genres in their
own right. Both are appropriate for delineation and expan-
sion (raga elaboration) through improvisation.
Improvisation can be defined as "spontaneous singing or
playing." Improvisation is "not pre-determined" and com-
prises various nuances, variations, embellishments, and
ornamentations sung by the performer during her or his
recital (Nooshin & Widdess, 2005). Through such extempore
improvisation, the raga is developed gradually and its whole
"personality" is built up, projected, and relished by the audi-
ence as well as the performer. Either the raga alone (as in
alap) or both the raga and lyrics are developed through
improvisation within a set rhythmic cycle with the ultimate
aim of creating, expressing, and awakening various emo-
tions, one of which can be the most predominant and pervad-
ing one, whereas others, more transient and subservient in
nature. For example, love can be the dominant emotion and
others such as longing, jealousy, stupefaction, anxiety, joy,
sadness, anger, and pity, among others, which are connected,
in one way or the other, to the dominant one, can be the tran-
sitory and servile ones. When the dominant emotion is expe-
rienced, along with the passing moods and emotions, in a
steady but impersonal, disinterested, and contemplative
manner, it is realized as rasa by the connoisseur as well as
the performer. Such a lofty experience comes in a flash and
is short-lived, but leaves a permanent and an enriching
imprint on the listener's mind. However, the fact related to
the imperativeness of improvisation for self-expression and
expression of one's moods and emotions can never be over-
emphasized upon.
6 SAGE Open
Having said this, the method of raga elaboration through
improvisation in Dhrupada genre differs from that of Khyal.
Raga Elaboration in Dhrupada-Dhamar
Genre
Dhrupada is the oldest living vocal and instrumental classi-
cal genres within the Hindustani system. Sanyal (1987)
maintains that Dhrupada is the most profound living tradi-
tion of Hindu spiritual music. It is a kind of music much
richer than any other musical genres because of its tonal
complexities and stylistic renderings. Saxena (2010) claims
that the word "Dhrupada" refers not only to a specific genre
of vocal classical music but also to the compositions preva-
lent in this genre. "Dhruva" means fixed, unchanging, eter-
nal, and "Pada," text or lyrics; thus, Dhrupada is a text
composed in praise of the Eternal, Unchanging, Immutable,
and Ultimate Reality. However, not only the text of the
composition is said to be spiritual, as it often has as subject-
matter themes related to spirituality, but also, more impor-
tantly, the kinesis and expressions of the musical notes.
A typical Dhrupada recital starts with alap, the unfold-
ing of the tonal potential of the raga, in very slow tempo
using mnemonic syllables. Alap is not constrained by tala
or lyrics. After the slow-moving alap reaches its climax,
the singer proceeds to the jod and jhala, which are ren-
dered in different tempos or varieties of aesthetic pace to
explore the raga in its entirety. According to the present
researcher, the last phase marks metaphorically, so to say,
the culmination of the spiritual journey into ecstatic delight
and freedom whereby the ego is sublimated and thus tran-
scended. Varma (2009) states, in this regard, that "[A]lapa
is basically the `spread-out' of the spiritual aesthetic vision
of the musician . . . Alapa thus expands what is latent in the
individual" (p. 73). After the alap-jod-jhala segment, that
is the anibaddha or unbound singing, is over, the nibad-
dha, or bound singing, the composition, is sung in its
entirety. This is followed by another segment of "anibad-
dha" music rendered in a playful way called upaj. The per-
former improvises with the words of the text in different
tunes and layakari-s or tempi within a specific tala, to,
time and again, reach and bring together the opening
phrase of the composition, or mukhda and its culminating
beat with the first beat of the tala, or sam, in every cycle,
or avartana. Reaching this meeting point (sam) together
bestows a very intense feeling of relief, satisfaction, and
happiness in the performers, the vocalist/s and
percussionist/s, as well as the audience.
The improvisational aspects of Dhamar are very much
similar to that of Dhrupada. However, the alap-jod-jhala
phase is shorter and less profound, and the upaj segment is
bouncier and colorful. It is very interesting to note that in
both the genres, the text (pada) as well as the melodic form
(raga) are subject to elaboration through improvisation.
Raga Elaboration in Khyal Genre
Khyal is regarded as the most popular vocal genre of singing
in Hindustani Raga-Sangita today. The Arabic and Persian
word "Khyal" means imagination, whim, vision, fantasy,
fancy, and thought, among others. Khyal is, thus, the imagi-
native rendering of the musician, which is full of feelings and
fancy. This genre is appreciated for its fluid, flexible, and
expansive character and its amenability to greater use of
ornamentations and embellishments to maximize aesthetic
expressiveness.
Khyal singing and its creative and improvisational fac-
ets differ in terms of presentation and emphasis from one
musical lineage (gharana)10 to another. Yet, the ornamen-
tations and embellishments are, more or less, similar across
the board. Both the nibaddha (preset composition) and
anibaddha (spontaneous improvisation) forms of music
are present in Khyal singing. After introducing the raga
and the composition, different kinds of embellishments
such as swara alap, akar alap, and bol-alap; swara
behelava and bol behelava; and swar tana, akar tana, and
bol-tana are sung within the composition for delineating
the raga. These are rendered through the musical notes
(swara-s) and/or wordings of the composition with various
kinds of tonal graces (gamaka-s).
Hindustani Raga-Sangita and Rasa
Experience
Hindustani Raga-Sangita is more suitable for awakening
rasa in the mind of the listeners for being, first, a largely
"improvised" (Nooshin & Widdess, 2005) kind of music
whereby individual creativity is appreciated and praised;
second, a heteronomous art-form, thus always making ref-
erence to and depicting some emotions outside itself; third,
a music comprising various "channels" through which a
wide range of human emotions can be expressed; fourth, a
genre of music which is sweetly rendered in a "tranquil,
yearning or ecstatic, and dignified manner" (Saxena,
2009b; 2010, p. 139), thus creating its sublime and spiritual
nature; and, finally, an art-form capable of reducing drasti-
cally the agitations of the mind, the root cause of all trials
and tribulations of existence. While talking about
Hindustani Raga-Sangita, Thielemann (2001) claims that
"[W]hile proceeding on his spiritual path, man resorts to
music as a vehicle . . . [and] a suitable tool to attain to
higher spiritual ends because of its capacity to intensify the
emotional potential of man" (p. 17). Ravi Shankar (2011),
the world-renowned Sitar player, while talking about
Hindustani Raga-Sangita, remarks that a raga is "the pro-
jection of the artist's inner spirit, a manifestation of his
most profound sentiments and sensibilities brought forth
through tones and melodies" (para. 11).
It is worth noting that, given the complexity of
Hindustani Raga-Sangita, only a trained contemplator or a
Pudaruth 7
connoisseur (sahrdaya) can understand and appreciate a
raga performance and help contribute to the kind of "give
and take" between her or him and the artist/e, an element so
crucial for the evocation or projection or manifestation of
rasa, which, in turn, gives rise to the experience of delight
(ananda). Conversely, the "primary or immediate quality"
(Saxena, 2009b) of a raga, such as sweetness of notes and
the like, can be accessible to everyone, irrespective of one's
training in and knowledge of music.
Be it clearly understood also, however, as Saxena
(2009b) points out, that rasa "is not mere emotion conveyed
by, or expressed through the form of the raga; it is the emo-
tive look of the raga-rupa (melodic form) itself . . ."
(emphasis in original). What is being stressed upon here is
that the whole melodic form, or "raga-rupa," and not just a
part of it, becomes the embodiment of an emotional state. It
is the tonal quality of the correlated sounds and the inner
dynamic of the raga which convey its emotive content.
Causes Leading to Rasa Experience in
Hindustani Raga-Sangita
According to Bharata, there are eight basic human emotions,
or mental predispositions (sthayibhava-s), and their corre-
sponding sublimated feelings (rasa-s) that could be experi-
enced in drama (natya) as follows:
Bhava-s Rasa-s
1. Rati (Love) Shringara (Erotic)
2. Hasa (Laughter) Hasya (Humorous)
3. Shoka (Grief) Karuna (Compassionate)
4. Krodha (Tendency to become angry) Raudra (Furious)
5. Utsaha (Tendency to feel enthused) Vira (Valorous)
6. Bhaya (Propensity to feel afraid) Bhayanaka (Fearful)
7. Jugupsa (Tendency to dislike, abhor) Vibhatsa (Odious)
8. Vismaya (Prone to wonder) Adbhuta (Wondrous)
9. Nirveda (Detachment) Shanta (Peaceful)
The ninth bhava and rasa, namely, Nirveda and Shanta,
respectively, were later additions, due to the high influence
of the Buddhist philosophy and the artistic representations of
the Buddha in meditative posture on Indian aesthetics.
When any one of these emotions (first column) is
expressed through drama, its corresponding rasa or "feeling
par excellence" (second column) can arise in the mind of the
performer as well as the connoisseur. Rasa experience builds
on and arises from the interplay of these natural, permanent
tendencies or predispositions of the mind (sthayibhava-s)
present in the performer as well as the perceiver or contem-
plator with (a) vibhava-s--alambana and uddipan--objec-
tive stimuli such as the main protagonists (alambana), and
the props or created surroundings and stage decoration, and
other subordinate or secondary characters (uddipan); (b)
anubhava-s--bodily movements (angika), speech (vachika),
involuntary signs such as tears (sattvika), and costumes,
lighting, and music and dance (aharya); and (c) fleeting and
transitory emotional states (sancharibhava-s and vyabhich-
aribhava-s). All these subjective and objective elements
when brought together give rise to the experience of rasa by
both the performers and the sensitive and discriminating
audiences.
If we apply the vibhava-s (determinants) and anubhava-s
(consequents) of drama to live music, the main musician and
accompanying musicians and the main character of the lyrics
(bandish) would be the vibhava-s; the performers and/or the
main characters as depicted in the text become the alambana,
and the stage decoration, accompanying musicians, and/or
the environment and secondary characters (e.g., sakhi) as
mentioned in the text, the uddipan. The musical sounds
(vachika), facial expressions (kayika), emotions felt and
expressed by the musicians (satwik), and their costumes,
appearance, and demeanor (aharya) on stage would then be
the anubhava-s. The sthayibhava-s are the predominant
emotions that are expressed by the performer as well as pro-
jected through the wordings of the text and their meanings.
Sancharibhava-s and vyabhicharibhava-s are the fleeting,
transitory, and less predominant emotions that well up and
fade out during and throughout the performances.
In the case of recorded music too, there can be aesthetic
experience of the highest kind. Although the main musician or
the main protagonists of the lyrics (e.g., Radha­Krishna; alam-
bana), and the accompanying musicians (uddipana), are not
seen, the texture, quality, and timbre of the voice, or musical
instruments of the musician and accompanying musicians, the
text and its meaning (in the case of vocal music), and the qual-
ity of the sound of the recording could be considered as vib-
hava-s. The sounds of the musical notes produced by them
either through singing or playing a musical instrument, the pre-
ciseness and correctness of the notes sung or played, the judi-
cious use of ornamentations and embellishments, the personal
creativity of the performer, and the emotions felt and expressed
by the performer will make up the anubhava-s. Together with
the sthayibhava-s (predominant emotion/s evoked by the raga
and text), sancharibhava-s, and vyabhicharibhava-s (the
8 SAGE Open
transitory, fleeting, and less predominant emotions), which
could all be heard while listening to a recorded music, the vib-
hava-s and anubhava-s could, undoubtedly, help evoke rasa in
the listener or connoisseur (rasika), provided, first, all these are
experienced in an impersonal or "unindividualized" way by her
or him, and, second, there are no factors leading to "rasa
bhang," or obstacles to aesthetic experience.
When these multiple "bhava-s" are expressed and experi-
enced in an "unindividualized" manner by the performers
and contemplated, in turn, by the connoisseurs (rasika-s) in a
yet impersonal way in both live and recorded music, the
main emotions are awakened and realized as rasa. The ego-
sense is surrendered for some time but not "rubbed out"
completely, as in mystical experience. This implies some
kind of detachment on the part of both the performer and the
listener or contemplator from their limited individuality, the
ego-consciousness. Raga-Sangita is, thus, regarded as a jour-
ney from the emotional to the spiritual.
Before we move on further, let us put forth a clarification
of the word "spiritual." Saxena (2010) states that the word
"spiritual" carries two meanings: a secular and a nonsecular
one. He defines secular spirituality as a state and a process
"belonging to or arising from the mind or intellect; or highly
refined in thought or feeling," and nonsecular spirituality as
"belonging, referring, or relating to the spirit or soul rather
than to the body or to physical things; belonging, referring,
relating to religion; or sacred, holy, divine" (Saxena, 2010,
pp. 137-138). Secular spirituality implies an intellectual
search for refinement in thought and feeling. Likewise,
Throsby (2001) refers to spirituality as that which involves
enlightenment, understanding, insight, and global or univer-
sal awareness. This is basically a Western view of spiritual-
ity. Nonsecular spirituality, which is typical of the Indian
view, refers to such matters as ego, soul, and salvation.
Music, according to Saxena (2010), is conducive to self-real-
ization or the realization of the spirit (atman-brahman)
within. In the same line of thought, Gautam (1980) defines
spiritual attainment as "the transcendence of the limitations
of egocentric impulses, where all consciousness of duality
has been obliterated" (pp. 80-82).
The crux of spirituality from the Hindu religion's perspec-
tive is the annihilation of the ego-sense, the source of all
physical, mental, and intellectual ills, and the attainment of
peace and tranquility within. Realization of tranquility or
serenity, which gives rise to humility, is regarded as an
important sign of spiritual attainment. In this regard, Gautam
(1980) throws light on the state of tranquility, which can be
achieved while performing Hindustani Raga-Sangita, by
saying that
the melody produced (out of the notes of a particular raga) will
create within him (the artiste) an ineffable tranquility. It seems
paradoxical to produce musical sound without; when silence
reigns within. This is, as I understand it, the "summum bonum"
of Indian music. (pp. 23-25)
This tranquility, if correctly expressed and conveyed, has the
capacity to invade the whole being of the listener as well,
provided he or she is attuned to receiving it. Vatsyayan
(1972) refers to this state of tranquility as the "still centre of
being."
Aesthetic experience (rasasnubhuti) and aesthetic delight
(rasananda), as they are understood in the Indian tradition,
are said to be akin to spiritual consciousness and the bliss of
self-realization, but one is, simply, not the other; at best, aes-
thetic experience, which is a transcendental, educative expe-
rience, can make the ideal goal of spiritual life appear
reachable or "feasible." It is, therefore, not difficult to make
out why most accomplished musicians in the Hindu tradi-
tion, for example, Saint Tyagarara, Swami Haridas, and the
like, were worship-worthy saints in their own right.Although
apparently two distinct paths, aesthetic and spirituality
unveiled their meeting points to those noble souls.
Determining Elements of Hindustani
Raga-Sangita Leading to Aesthetic
Experience: Swara-s, Ornamentations,
Embellishments, and Expression of
Emotions
Before attempting to discuss further the determining ele-
ments of Hindustani Raga-Sangita in a detailed manner, let
us, first of all, make some clarifications as to the two terms
"ornamentations" and "embellishments," and their distinc-
tions and overlaps, as these were debated in ancient musical
treatises and are understood in present-day Hindustani clas-
sical music scenario.
In ancient musical treatises, two types of alankara were
mentioned, namely, varnalankar and shabdalankar.
Varnalankar referred to tonal movements based on the four
varna-s, namely, sthayi, arohi, avrohi, and sanchari; and
shabdalankar meant all other sonic production techniques
rendered by the voice or a musical instrument. Therefore,
varnalankar related "to the structural aspect" of a raga
whereas shabdalankar "comprised the aesthetic aspect." So,
in ancient times, shabdalankar referred to "everything that a
performer wove both melodically and rhythmically outside
the periphery of the fixed composition," thus encompassing
today's ornamentations (kan, khatka, murkhi, etc.) and
embellishments (alap, behelava, tana, etc.), excluding the
four aforesaid tonal movements.
But, as per current practices, the eight anga-s or limbs,
namely, alap, sargam, bol-alap, behelava, bol-behelava,
bol-banth, tana, and bol-tana as well as kaku would, collec-
tively, be termed shabdalankar or embellishments, and the
tonal ornamentations such as kan, murkhi, meend, and oth-
ers, alankara or ornamentations. The various arrangements
of notes in specific sequences rendered for training purpose,
especially by beginners, however, are called varnalankar, or,
simply, alankara or vocal exercise.
Pudaruth 9
However, more often than not, these two terms, namely,
ornamentations and embellishments, are used interchange-
ably by both students and teachers. There are different defi-
nitions and interpretations for these two terms. In spite of
this, I believe that a line of demarcation has to be drawn
between the two, and ancient musical treatises could give us
a hint on how to go about it. But what matters most is that, at
the end of the day, learners should be able to render these
ornamentations and embellishments flawlessly, whether
these are raga-specific or form-specific (ITC, Sangeet
Research Academy).11
Swara-s
The basic elements of Hindustani Raga-Sangita having the
capacity to lead to aesthetic experience are the 22 shruti-s
(microtones). Out of these 22 microtones, a minimum num-
ber of five and a maximum number of seven could be selected
for a particular raga and these become its notes (swara-s) in
ascending and descending order. In the words of Dr.
Vidyadhar Oke,12 a swara is a chosen, single frequency, and
has softness, viscosity, steadiness, resonance, accuracy, and
delightfulness or the capacity to please the listeners'mind, as
fundamental qualities. Generally, it is said that there are 12
different pitches as follows: S r R g G m M P d D n N. Dr.
Oke further states that out of these, besides Sa and Pa which
are already single frequencies, thus notes in their own right,
10 are, strictly speaking, not notes, but frequency ranges of
notes or ranges of individual frequencies called swarak-
shetra-s. In each of those 10 frequency ranges or swarak-
shetra-s, there are two shruti-s, and any one selected from
these for a raga becomes its (raga's) note or swara. For
example, r is, in fact, a frequency range having two individ-
ual frequencies (a lower r1 and a higher r2): r1 as is used in
raga Todi, and a higher r2 as is used in raga Bhairav. It is also
said that the distinction between a tone and a "swara" (musi-
cal note) is only in terms of the latter's amount of refinement,
as compared with the former's plainness. Hence, a tone has
to be made into a swara through in-depth reflection and rig-
orous practice.
Ornamentations
Having said this, the swara-s or refined tones alone cannot
bring out the aesthetic potentials of a raga. In the latter, the
musical notes need to be rendered with ornamentations
known as "gamaka-s" or "alankar-s." Parshvadeva sheds
light on the concept of "gamaka" as follows:
When in a song a note peeps over the region of its own legitimate
shruti-s (microtones) a shade into the region of its (higher or
lower) neighbours a `Gamaka' is there. (Ranade, 1976, p. 36)
These subtle ornamentations or "graces" are integral to the
notes of each distinct raga, and not extrinsic and accidental
to it. Those graces can be expressed in different ways, either
as a glide from one note to another, or touch of one, two, or
three notes with another, or simply a shake to a particular
note. Therefore, each raga acquires its uniqueness because
of not only its musical notes but also the latter's aesthetically
rendered, accompanying graces. Thus, in Indian music, a
bare note, as is played on a keyboard, or a staccato, is very
rarely used, if at all. Each note is linked to its preceding or
succeeding note. A musical note, to be qualified as "musi-
cal," must invariably move along with its graces.
Without going into the origin and historical development
of gamaka in Indian music, for this is beyond the purview of
this article, the author now moves on to the types of orna-
mentations which are used in Hindustani Music in the pres-
ent time. Suffice it to say, the different types of gamaka-s, as
mentioned in some old music treatises, for example,
Natyashastra of Bharat Muni and Sangitaratnakara of
Sharangdeva, are still being used today, but under different
appellations.
Ornamentations in Khyal Genre
As mentioned earlier, Khyal is the most popular genre of
Hindustani or North Indian classical vocal music nowadays.
This form of singing involves a lot of improvisation and cre-
ativity in its rendering.
The ornamentations used in Khyal singing are as follows.
Kan or sparsh. When a note is sung or played with a touch of
a preceding or succeeding note, a kan or sparsh is produced
and thus embellishes that main note.
Meend.This is a slow glide from one note to another in
ascending (anuloma) or descending (viloma) order with a
view to connecting and bringing them to light. Meend is a
unique tonal grace in the sense that it is used only in Indian
music.
Khatka. This ornamentation is executed in fast speed around
a main note. The main note is embellished with a touch of the
next higher note and then with that of the next lower note, or
vice versa. This is also known as gitkiri in instrumental
music.
Murkhi. Murkhi is softer than a khatka, but as fast as the lat-
ter. It is rendered in a cluster around a main note, but instead
of involving four notes, it does with only three notes.
Zamzamma. If a series of murkhi is executed in ascending or
descending order, a new kind of ornamentation called
zamzamma is produced. Such ornamentation is mostly used
in Sitar.
Andolan. This is rendered by doing a gentle oscillation of a
note so much so that it involves the microtones of its higher
10 SAGE Open
counterpart; thus, it is a subtle oscillation in between two
notes. The note on which the oscillation takes place is called
the andolita swar. It is worth noting that andolan is raga
specific and thus cannot be used whimsically in any raga.
Gamaka. This is a specific type of ornamentation bearing the
same name as its generic term "gamaka." If a musical move-
ment between, let us say, Sa and Re is rendered in slow
speed, it becomes a meend. But if the same movement is
executed with force in fast speed from below or above, a
gamaka is produced.
Kampana. This is rendered by oscillating a note in fast speed,
and the resulting effect is a shake or a vibrato.
Lahak and hudak. These are typical ornamentations rendered
in the Dhrupada genre of singing. Lahak is a grace move-
ment produced by singing a note from below with a slight
touch of breath force. In hudak, the same exercise is per-
formed with a heavier pull from below with a more forceful
breath exhalation that creates a "hum" sound.
Dhuran and muran. Dhuran and muran are rendered when
the musical notes are sung in a rounded pattern in ascending
and descending order, respectively.
All the above-mentioned ornamentations have very
important functions in Hindustani Raga-Sangita:
i. They embellish the music;
ii. They bring out the salient features of the melodic
matrix or raga;
iii. They strengthen the genre or form of music being
performed and segregate it from others;
iv. They demarcate Hindustani Raga-Sangita from other
systems of music in the world;
v. They act as vehicles to express various emotions and
moods.
However, it is to be noted that the above-stated ornamen-
tations should be executed in such a way that they do not
appear "artificial" or "formal." One has to practice very hard
and systematically for their proper execution, but once they
are used in a raga, they should blend into the very personal-
ity of that raga. This is achieved through proficiency and
self-expression. Sanyal (1987) poins out in this regard that a
performer must transcend the formal structure of a raga in
order to experience and project the beautiful (pp. 175-206).
Embellishments in Hindustani Raga-Sangita
The most important types of embellishments are alap (raga
delineation in slow tempo) and its kinds, behelava (raga
delineation in moderate tempo comprising different rhyth-
mic patterns) and its kinds, and tana (raga delineation in fast
tempo) and its kinds. These embellishments are part and
parcel of Khyal singing. Alap using mnemonic syllables
(nom-tom) rendered at different speed (sphurita), and upaj
(improvisation with the wordings of the composition in dif-
ferent rhythmic divisions) forms an integral part of Dhrupada
singing. Instrumental music, such as Violin and Sitar,
involves most of these forms of embellishments.
There is yet another form of embellishment known as
"kaku" that occupies an important place in Indian Music, be
it Hindustani or Carnatic. Kaku refers to a specific sound
modulation in the rendering of the musical notes to convey
the multilayered meaning and emotions and moods of a text
and/or the diverse shades and nuances of a raga. In vocal
music, the performer takes recourse to different "voices" in
different timbres and volumes to express his or her inner
feelings in a varied way, thus creating a tension in quest of a
resolution. Just like a dancer takes recourse to abhinaya to
express a plethora of emotions, a vocalist or instrumentalist
uses kaku as vocal abhinaya to give vent to the complexities
of human emotions through voice modulations. Although six
types of kaku have been mentioned in ancient musical trea-
tises, in actual practices, any kind of tonal or vocal modula-
tion having the capacity to evoke a particular emotion is
considered a kaku. Having said that, it is noteworthy that
kaku is used quite sparsely in Dhrupada and Khyal genres,
lest its excessive use might dilute their sobriety and chastity
as classical genres.
Expression of Emotions in Hindustani Raga-
Sangita
Music as an art-form must satisfy both the heart and the
head. One is even tempted to go a step further in saying that
when music touches the heart, it overwhelms the whole
being so much so that very little space is left for intellectual
realization, thus transcending the knower­known dichotomy.
It is a journey from the heart to the soul, the emotional to the
spiritual. For music to have such an impact on one's emo-
tional being, it ought to be made into an appropriate means to
communicate inner feelings and thus fully expressive in
nature.
By being a heteronomous art-form, unlike autonomous
art-forms which are strictly self-referential, Hindustani
Raga-Sangita is an integral part of the empirical life of man,
as it always points to some emotive, social, moral, religious,
or spiritual values. "Heteronomous art . . . imitates, repre-
sents, or expresses things outside itself" (Hamilton, 2007,
para. 27). Let alone the lyrics of a composition, which is
obviously heteronomous in nature, even a raga refers to and
conveys an emotion beyond its own melodic form which can
be revived and relished by the connoisseurs each time the
raga is sung or played. Even a tala played at a certain speed
is replete with references beyond itself. For example,
Teentala played at fast speed can never convey the sentiment
of pathos.
Pudaruth 11
Having said this, it is imperative for and incumbent upon
the practitioners to express emotions while performing, and
not just to demonstrate the mere technical excellence. A
music which is mugged up and/or stresses excessively on
technical excellence is devoid of its quintessence or sap
(rasa) and is thus "empty," arid, and uninspiring. However,
one will never overemphasize on the fact that to make one's
music become a vehicle for the expression of emotions, one
has to master the "nuts and bolts" of the art-form. Extensive
learning and listening, intensive analysis and reflection, and
rigorous practice and refinement are the basic pedagogical
obligations for all students of Raga-Sangita during their
training or "taleem" period, which can easily extend over a
decade or more. It is only then that Raga-Sangita becomes an
object of contemplation for the talented performer as well as
the sensitive and discriminating listener (rasika).
Conclusion
Prerequisites for and Obstacles in Aesthetic
Experience of Hindustani Raga-Sangita
As stated above, rasa experience through Hindustani Raga-
Sangita, as is the case for other genres, styles, and forms of
music in the world, builds on and arises from the chemistry
of the different bhava-s, or emotions and moods, both per-
manent and transitory, as projected by an able performer
from his or her inner core with a blend of his or her musical
knowledge, skills, understanding, and judgment. When the
connoisseur listens to such a soul-lifting music, through
complete absorption in the art-form (tanmayi bhavana) and
the automatic process of universalization (sadharanikarana),
aesthetic relish (rasawada) takes place, the beautiful is
evoked (rasanishpatti), and delight (ananda) is experienced.
Such an experience has been compared with the bliss of self-
realization, which is transcendental and supra-mundane in
nature. It can be experienced or relished by someone who is
sensitive to beauty, thus simply not given to everyone. In
fact, aesthetic experience is the enjoyment of "one's (own)
being, as an intrinsic, indivisible aspect of one's (higher)
self" (Saxena, 2009a; Gautam, 1988, p. 158).
In real life, objects are considered as either pleasant or
painful or neutral depending on how and for what purpose
and utility an individual or percipient relates to these objects.
In aesthetic experience, as the percipient is free from all indi-
vidual personal attachment, purpose, or utility, the aesthetic
object is experienced by the de-individualized or imperson-
alized self as bliss. Such bliss is nothing but the very essence
of the self in the state of "de-individualization," free from the
shackles of the ego-sense. As stated above, rasa is mani-
fested in the percipient because of his or her capacity for
universalization which is, however, temporary in nature.
Hence, though such an experience is unique, transcending
(alaukika), different from mundane ones (lokottara), and is
similar to spiritual experience, that is, the experience of
Moksha (liberation from the cycles of births and deaths, as
understood in Indian philosophy), rasa experience is tran-
sient and short-lived and endures as long as the stimuli com-
ing from the art-form are present.
Abhinavagupta, while commenting on the Natyashastra
in his Abhinavabharati, makes reference to seven sadhaka-s
or positive factors which are conducive to aesthetic experi-
ence of the highest kind. These are (a) inborn capacity to
enjoy and appreciate works of art (Rasikta), (b) theoretical
and practical knowledge of and insight and sensitivity toward
the work of art being experienced (Sahrdaya), (c) extraordi-
nary imaginative power to fill the gap and make sense of that
aspect of the work of art which is not perceptible (Pratibha),
(d) inner predisposition (inherent and acquired) to appreciate
works of art (Vasana Samskara), (e) capacity for rumination,
capacity for recollecting parts, and contemplating these as a
whole (Bhavana-Charvana), (f) physically and mentally fit
to enjoy works of art (Sharirika and Manasika Yogyata), and
(g) capacity to lose one's limited self and identifying com-
pletely with the work of art (Tadatmya). Deficit of any of
these prerequisites will, at best, lead to a "surface satisfac-
tion" of the aesthetic object (Saxena, 1996). At the bottom
line, one who can experience bliss through music or any
other art-forms is a connoisseur (sahrdaya or rasika), for he
or she can get himself or herself in a state of consciousness
devoid of individual particularities and conditions, in short,
the ego-sense.
Be that as it may, there are certainly several important
obstacles on the path leading to aesthetic experience in Raga-
Sangita.Abhinavagupta also mentions seven such obstacles or
vigna-s or badhak-s in the context of experiencing a drama or
poem as follows: (a) improbability (Sambhavanaviraharupa--
pratipattavayogyata), (b) intrusion of space­time particularity
(Svagataparagatatvaniyamena des'akaladivis'esavesah), (c)
helplessness of personal mood (Nijasukhadivivas'ibhavah),
(d) lack of means of apprehension (Pratityapayavaikalyam),
(e) lack of clarity (Sphutatvabhavah), (f) lack of emphasis on
the principal element (Apradhanata), and (g) doubt
(Sams'ayayogah).
Hence, based on the above-mentioned prerequisites for
and obstacles to rasanubhava, as discussed by Bharat Muni
and Abhinavagupta, and the long-standing experience and
observation of the author spanning over 43 years as well as
the views of other musicians (Pt. Ritwik Sanyal, Pt.
Vidyadhar Vyas, Prof. Chittaranjan Jyotishi, Late Dr. Pradeep
Kumar Dikshit) and musicologists (Gautam, 1980; Saxena,
1996, 2009a, 2009b, 2010; Varma, 2009) in their capacity as
teachers, researchers, thinkers, and performers, the following
could be submitted as the main hindrances to aesthetic expe-
rience in Hindustani Raga-Sangita:
a. Lack of proper understanding and grasping of the ba-
sics of Hindustani Raga-Sangita;
b. Faulty use of the voice and its placement, production,
intonation, and modulation, in the case of vocal music,
12 SAGE Open
and faulty handling of the sound production of musi-
cal instruments, in the case of instrumental music;
c. Unrestrained and improper use of the elements of mu-
sic, namely, shruti-s, swara-s, ornamentations, embel-
lishments, and expression of emotions;
d. Mixing up of genres, styles, and forms in an unreason-
able way;
e. Too much emphasis on technical and grammatical ex-
cellence;
f. Mugging up of ornamentations and embellishments
and rendering same in performances without any per-
sonal creative outputs;
