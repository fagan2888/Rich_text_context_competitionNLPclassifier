Abstract
Lake ice depth provides important information about local and regional climate change, weather patterns,
and recreational safety, as well as impacting in situ ecology and carbon cycling. However, it is challenging to
measure ice depth continuously from a remote location, as existing methods are too large, expensive, and/or
time-intensive. Therefore, we present a novel application that resolves size, cost, and automation issues using
commercially-available soil water content reflectometer sensors from multiple manufactures. Analysis of sen-
sors deployed in an environmental chamber using a scale model of a lake demonstrated accurate measure of
the change in ice depth over any time period to within 1 cm, through sensor response of liquid-to-solid
phase change. A robust correlation exists between volumetric water content in time as a function of environ-
mental temperature and ice growth. This relationship allows us to convert volumetric water content into ice
depth. An array of these sensors can be used in lake or river settings to create a temporally high-resolution
ice depth record, which fills in a needed gap for ecological or climatological studies as well as increasing pub-
lic recreational safety.
Lakes are an important component of the Earth's climate
system and climate change impacts to lakes include altera-
tions to both physical and biological processes throughout
all seasons (Magnuson et al. 1997). Long term winter records
of lake and river ice cover have been compiled from Canada
(Duguay et al. 2006), Finland (Korhonen 2006) and the
Northern Hemisphere (Magnuson et al. 2000) and show
shorter ice coverage periods. Global climate modeling efforts
show that lakes have strong connections to climate at the
local (Deng et al. 2012) and regional scales (Strong et al.
2014). Several lake-atmospheric observation data sets are
available now (Schertzer et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2014), but
year round observational data including ice thickness from
lakes that freeze are needed to better parametrize models.
Winter lake ice cover has important implications beyond
just local and regional climate, such as water quality, ecol-
ogy, and human use. Ice cover reduces surface energy and
gas exchange. The partitioning of sensible and latent heat
fluxes by lakes impact the local atmospheric surface layer's
stability (Nagarajan et al. 2004) and can have effects at the
regional scale (Rouse et al. 2005). Ice cover can lead to
anoxic and low-light conditions, both of which can impact
phytoplankton and their linked food-chains (Vanderploeg
et al. 1992). Man-made structures can be damaged by ice
expansion or drift and recreational activity safety depend on
ice cover and thickness. With nearly 2,000,000 people partic-
ipating in ice fishing annually in the United States (United
States Department of the Interior and Wildlife Service 2013)
and the majority of deaths being attributed to thin lake ice
(Barss 2006), ice thickness measurements disseminated to
the public in near-real-time would greatly improve the safety
conditions of recreational ice activities.
However, measurements of lake ice is challenging due to
the physical properties of the water-liquid boundary. Several
types of under-ice measurements are possible including sub-
surface solar radiation data which require knowledge of how
ice conditions that change radiative transfer throughout the
winter (Bolsenga 1978) and moored sub-surface sonar sensors
which requires temperature dependent speed of sound cor-
rections, (Melling et al. 1995; Brown and Duguay 2011).
Recent advances in using X- and Ku-band radar is promising,
but requires information or assumptions on ice conditions
(Gunn et al. 2015), in which in situ data is still needed. One
of the larger datasets from oceanographic submarine sonar
data and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (2006) does
not apply to lake systems. Buoys have been used in the Arc-
tic Ocean, but larger-scale deployment is limited by produc-
tion cost of the buoys themselves (Polashenski et al. 2011).
Weekly time-series data can be collected by hand, but is
labor intensive and can miss temporal processes between

collections, including key parameters like seasonal ice maxi-
mum and dangerous thin ice (Sleator 1995). Ice can also be
modeled using thermodynamic properties and optical satel-
lite data to calibrate models (Liston and Hall 1995; Wang
et al. 2010). While short-scale temporal modeling is possible,
models are sensitive to atmospheric wind speed, the condi-
tion and depth of snow on top of the ice, surface albedo and
radiation fluxes and uncertainties limit to model accuracy.
Recently, to measure ice thickness Cui et al. (2015) demon-
strates new methodology that utilizes in situ measurements
of electrical resistance to model ice thickness. This approach
allows a direct measurement of the ice sheet, but requires a
temperature-dependent correction and a complex, custom
build sensor array.
Here, we demonstrate how commercially-available, rela-
tively low-cost and low-power soil water content reflectome-
ter sensors can be repurposed as a tool to measure lake ice.
These sensors traditionally measure the volumetric water
content of soils using time-domain reflectometry and hence
are able to detect the phase change of water. Their temporal
response, cost, and durability make them a cost effective way
to record sub-hourly ice thickness directly with minimal
manual labor and measurement uncertainties that are associ-
ated with the other ice thickness methods. We discuss opera-
tional characteristics of the sensors as well as the temperature
relationship of ice formation and melt in a lab setting.
Methods
Experimental setup
We built a model to simulate a lake freezing only from
the surface down, instead of freezing inwards from all sides
(Fig. 1). The molded polyethylene 46 cm 3 10 cm 3 46 cm
tank (United States Plastic Corp., Lima, Ohio) was wrapped
around the sides and bottom with fiberglass insulation
4.25 cm thick on the sides and 8.5 cm thick on the bottom
to limit heat transfer through those surfaces.
Water content reflectometers (Campbell Scientific CS616,
Logan, Utah) operate by generating an electromagnetic sig-
nal and then measuring the signal attenuation and travel
time down the probe length and back. Normally used in
soil, changes in signal strength and travel time is used to cal-
culate soil volumetric water content based on soil type
standard calibrations. When used in the simulated lake, the
sensors measure water phase change between liquid and
solid states, resulting in a lower volumetric water content
reading as the ice solidifies around the sensors.
Two of these sensors were attached to a wooden dowel
with the sensors placed on the bottom on either side of the
dowel. A wooden dowel was used as it would conduct less
heat, helping to ensure a level ice layer. The dowel was
placed upright in the center of the tank and secured so that
it would not tilt. The tank was then filled with tap water
until the top sensor's prongs had been covered, roughly
10 L. Thermocouples (Omega; Type T Copper-Constantan)
were placed in the side insulation, both 10 cm from the bot-
tom of the tank, as well as in the water, one at 1 cm off of
the bottom of the tank the other 1 cm below the water sur-
face. This was done to measure water temperatures without
influence of the tank sides.
The tank was placed in a programmable environmental
chamber (Tenney Versa Tenn V, Tidal Engineering, Randolph,
Fig. 1. A conceptual figure of the experimental design using the simu-
lated lake in a Tenney environmental chamber.

between experimental runs showing the insulated polyethylene tank.

New Jersey) (Fig. 2). The data logger (Campbell Scientific
CR10X, Logan, Utah) was stored outside of the chamber and
collected volumetric water content data at 30-min intervals.
The tank was frozen twice at 2308C, three times at 2208C,
and once at 2108C. After every experiment the ice growth
was removed, measured with a ruler and then melted before
the next experiment began, with one melting experiment at
208C and one at 308C. Also, the tank was held at a constant
temperature of 08C once. The length of each varied between
4 h and 18 h.
Several experimental runs were needed to determine the
operating characteristics of the environmental chamber and
tank. The final design is shown in Fig. 1 and was a semi-
filled tank with insulation covering part of the sides and a
fan to circulate air in the headspace above the waterline. A
lower volume of water in the tank lead to faster experimen-
tal runs as less thermal mass needed to change temperature.
In a smaller 7.5 L tank, we conducted a second set of
experiment to test the effects of sensor probe deformation
and ion concentration variation on uncertainty in ice
thickness-SWC relationship. For ionic concentration, a sim-
ple solution from 60 g of sodium chloride was used. In this
modified set up the effects of bending the rods, cutting
them, and placing a solid object between them were exam-
ined as well. This tank was also used to compare two water
content reflectometers (10HS Soil Moisture Smart Sensor)
from a second manufacture (Decagon Devices, Pullman,
Washington) using a HOBO data logger (Onset Computer
Corporation, Bourne, Massachusetts).
Data analysis
The relationship of CS616 sensors' soil water content
response to ice depth was linear, thus require only two cali-
bration coefficients, an intercept for maximum depth and
sensor ice sensitivity. When the probes are fully covered in
ice, the sensor response is 0. Thus, we can derive ice depth
using the following equation, where a is the resting volumet-
ric water content reading, m is the slope and x is the sensor's
measurement, along with the 30 cm length of the probe.

We assume y is a linear function of temperature.
The response of the sensor with no ice varies by sensor,
and thus require sensor specific calibration to derive resting
volumetric water content in liquid water with no ice. Tests
so far found this value to be dependent on inherent charac-
teristic and physical properties of the probes, including any
deformation or bending. For Sensor "1", the resting volumet-
ric water content was 0.74 in soil volumetric fraction, result-
ing in Eq. 1 where m is the slope at which ice forms.

Sensor "2" had a different resting volumetric water con-
tent reading in room temperature liquid water of 0.96. The
same method of converting water content to ice depth was
applied. Changes to this calibration equation were needed
when converting between volumetric water content and ice
depth for Decagon sensors due to shorter (15 cm) probe
length and different resting temperatures. Sensor accuracy
and precision information were based off of the manufac-
ture's specifications.
Results
Twenty freezing and melting tests were run in the envi-
ronmental chamber. A photo of one run is shown in Fig. 2.
The lowest recorded air temperature was 2308C and the low-
est water temperature was 2158C, while the highest air and
water temperature was 208C. The chamber was run for longer
periods of time at warmer conditions to ensure complete ice
melt between runs, and also allowed temperature equilib-
rium throughout the volume. As designed, ice formation was
primarily top down with ice growth along the side and bot-
tom not significant under test runs of less than 12 h. Longer

runs at colder temperatures caused ice growth along all sides
of the tank due to insulation limitations, creating complex
and unrealistic conditions.
An environmental run of a 4 h temperature step function
between 2308C and 208C is shown in Fig. 3 to highlight sen-
sor performance. A small amount of ice (2 cm) was left from
the previous run to show volumetric water content sensor
response is similar between melting of a surface lay of ice
and melting ice at depth. There is a time lag between air and
water temperature changes, due in part to insulation of the
tank, and water temperatures start above 08C. With a
decrease in temperature, a clear response from the sensors
showing 0.3 cm of ice growth in 15 min is noted. When
temperatures increase from 2308C, the ice layer was 12 cm
thick and little new ice growth is noted. When water tem-
peratures are positive, the sensor shows 0.7 cm of ice melt
over 15 min.
The derived relationship between volumetric water con-
tent and ice depth is shown in Fig. 4a, with this environ-
mental run starting with above freezing water and no ice.
After 3 h, water temperature cools to below freezing and ice
growth begins. After the run, the ice layer was removed and
measured to calibrate the sensors. Similar environmental
runs were done at multiple temperatures (Fig. 4b) with 6 cm
of ice growth taking 3 h longer at 2208C air temperature as
compared to 2308C.
The comparison between Campbell and Decagon sensors,
both at 2208C, is shown in Fig. 4c. While there is a differ-
ence in insulation as the Decagon sensors where tested in
the smaller tank, there is the same amount of ice growth
after 18 h. To test melting conditions, several environmental
runs were done with an existing ice sheet in place. Figure 4d
shows a run at 308C.
The expected linear relationship between the rate of ice
change (freezing or melting) and temperature between
2308C and 308C is shown in Fig. 5. Areas of melting or a
decrease in ice thickness is shaded. The r2 value of the
Fig. 4. Conversation is shown between typical sensor readings of volu-
metric water content to the calculated ice depth values (A), ice sheet
growth at 2208C and 2308C (B), Campbell and Decagon sensors at
2208C (C) and ice sheet melt at 308C (D).

deformation ionic concentration experiments both changed

Discussion
Comparison to other ice thickness measurements
Current measurements of lake ice thickness are either
labor intensive, sensitive to changing ice conditions or
cost prohibitive, while ice thickness is an important eco-
logical and climatological measurement that is often
overlooked in favor of only measuring the timing and
extent of ice cover. We successfully showed in a lab
experiment that using soil water content sensors is a pre-
cise and cost effective system to measure ice depth. Sen-
sors from both Campbell Scientific and Decagon Devices
performed similarly, with the only noted difference
between the two being probe length and compatibility
with logger systems. The system can be deployed season-
ally or left on the body of water year-round, either as a
stand-alone sensor or as part of a water quality or water
level measurement suite.
In comparison to other electrical resistance type methods,
here the entire rod is integrated over the measurement so air
pockets in the ice, liquid lens, or ice cracks are not a prob-
lem unlike in other ice depth measurements and sensor soil
water response precision instead of placement of electrodes
determines the maximum ice depth precision. Also of note
is that, ice thickness can be measured at the sub-hourly scale
throughout the entire winter, previously only possible with
custom built buoys or electrical resistance sensors. However,
sensor resting water content is quite variable between sen-
sors (see section 4.2), and thus in situ calibration is recom-
mended at least once per sensor to have a base reference
point for Eq. 3.
Ice temperature information is needed to calculate ice
thickness with other techniques. The electrical resistance
sensors of Cui et al. (2015) require air, ice and water temper-
ature measurements to correct resistance measurements
before thickness is derived. The relationship between tem-
perature and ice growth/decay shown in Fig. 5 is linear,
matching the predicted analytical ice models for small ice
sheet volumes with no insulating snow (Lepp
aranta 1993).
This shows temperature corrections are not required for
time-domain reflectometry sensors and that the need to
measure environmental temperature of other techniques is
eliminated. This has the results of reducing the complexity
and error of the final ice thickness measurement.
The cost of the Campbell Scientific dataloggers that are
compatible with their soil water content sensors start at
$1000, which could be cost-prohibitive, but Campbell Scien-
tific soil water content sensors cost $120 each. The cost of a
pair of Decagon sensors to equal the same 30 cm probe
length and a HOBO logger was $600 total. Either option
would be well over an order of magnitude less expensive
than a comparable sub-surface sonar sensor which costs
$18,000.
Sensor limits and seasonal-scale errors
Thin ice sheets can be difficult to measure. With manu-
facture reported sensor accuracy of 2.5% percent for the
Campbell Scientific CS616 probes and 3.1% for the Decagon
sensors, this translates to ice thickness accuracy of 0.75 cm
and 0.465 cm, respectively. Given that ice thickness can
change relatively fast for thin ice sheets (Thorndike 1992),
measurements may not be fully reliable until nearly a full
centimeter of ice growth is present. For context, an ice thick-
ness of 5 cm is typically given as a minimum threshold to
the public for winter activity safety and a thickness of
10.1 cm is advised for ice fishing.
In testing, it was noted that the resting volumetric water
content reading of the sensor was affected by the ion con-
centration of the water. Readings were changed by only
1­2% when a sodium chloride solution was used that was
significantly higher than typically seen in the environment.
This can lead to errors of 0.3 cm in ice thickness, but would
require a large change in dissolved ion concentration under
the ice, not just a high ion concentration. Except in rare
cases, should not lead to systemic issues with the measure-
ment. If this is a concern, collocating a dissolved ion mea-
surement would allow for this effect to be corrected.
In potential cases of ice drift or heave deforming the sen-
sor probes, another error of 1­2% in volumetric water con-
tent would lead to error of 0.3 cm in ice thickness. This is
due to sensors being bent in a way that altered the proximity
to nonwater solid objects, and hence the sensor's signal
delay and attenuation. In our laboratory setup, bending the
probes around the wooden support created an error of one
percent in the measurement. Sensor location in the field is
an important consideration if ice drift or heave is typical for
that lake. Solid mounting on a structure that is resistant to
ice damage (pier, bridge abutment or support) would remove
this error.
Cumulative errors from changing water ion concentra-
tions or probe deformations can be limited with proper care
in selecting measurement locations. For measurements in
difficult locations, these corrections can be addressed at the
end of the winter season. A change in ice-free resting volu-
metric water content reading can be tested using prewinter
and postwinter readings and corrections similar to snow
depth measurements can be applied (Johnson and Marks
2004).
Conclusion
Currently there are few cost effective methods to directly
measure ice cover and thickness. This work demonstrates
how soil water content sensors can be repurposed to measure

ice thickness without having to correct for environmental
temperature and at shorter timescales than possible with
most other methods currently used by the field. Response is
linear from 0 cm up to probe length, with estimate precision
of 0.1% and accuracy of 2.5% for the Campbell sensors and
precision of 0.07% and accuracy of 3.1% for the Decagon
sensors. Due to the change in travel time of a generated elec-
tromagnetic pulse from the sensor that captures the phase
transition during ice grow/melt, the measurement is simi-
larly robust and comparable to time-reflectance sonic sensors
that measure changes in snowpack height during the cold
season compared to a snow-free reference point. Individual
sensors probes can be deformed by ice drift with minimal
effect on the measurement. Despite sensor-specific calibra-
tion issues, this new sensor application allows the possibility
of large-scale lake or river measurement networks in the
future, with implications for safety, as well as environmental
or climate change research.
