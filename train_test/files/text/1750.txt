Disorder, and Young Adult Intimate Partner Violence

Context: Studies based on clinical samples suggest a
connection between childhood attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and later intimate part-
ner violence (IPV) perpetration.
Objective: To examine the association between retro-
spectively reported childhood ADHD and conduct dis-
order (CD) symptoms and the perpetration of physical
IPV in a population-based sample of young adults.
Design, Setting, and Participants: The study popu-
lation consisted of 11 238 participants (mean [SD] age,
22.0 [1.7] years) in the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health. Multinomial logistic regressions and
propensity score matching were used to analyze the re-
lationships of IPV with symptoms of ADHD domains (hy-
peractive/impulsive and inattentive) and symptoms of CD
as well as with ADHD and CD dichotomized on the ba-
sis of symptom criteria.
Main Outcome Measures: Respondents' answers to
the 2 questions in the wave III survey reflecting perpe-
tration of physical violence toward a partner were used
to define IPV perpetration. Intimate partner violence per-
petration resulting in injury or not was assessed with a
follow-up question.
Results: Conduct disorder significantly predicted IPV
perpetration both with and without injury. Controlling
for CD and hyperactivity/impulsivity, inattention inde-
pendently predicted young adult IPV perpetration with-
out injury. Controlling for inattention and CD, no sig-
nificant relationship between hyperactivity/impulsivity
and IPV perpetration without injury was found. Results
were different regarding IPV perpetration resulting in
injury. Hyperactivity/impulsivity, but not inattention,
independently predicted IPV perpetration resulting in
injury. In categorical analyses, CD predicted both types
of IPV, and ADHD significantly predicted IPV perpetra-
tion resulting in injury but did not significantly predict
IPV perpetration without injury.
Conclusions: Conduct disorder is consistently associ-
ated with violence in intimate relationships. Control-
ling for CD, there is also an association between ADHD
and IPV. Results suggest the need for services and treat-
ment strategies that specifically address the risks for vio-
lence and promote healthy intimate relationships for
youths with CD and ADHD.

INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE (IPV)
is a serious public health prob-
lem affecting millions of people
each year in the United States. It
can be defined as physical, sexual,
or psychological harm by a current or
former partner or spouse.1 It results in ap-
proximately 2 million injuries requiring
medical attention and 1500 deaths annu-
ally.2,3 Other potential consequences of IPV
include posttraumatic stress disorder, de-
pression, reproductive health problems, ir-
ritable bowel syndrome, and chronic
pain.4-6 The costs of IPV against women
alone exceed an estimated $8.3 billion
(2003 dollars) per year.7,8
As recognition of IPV as a serious prob-
lem increases, research has identified vari-
ous risk factors for IPV perpetration, in-
cluding history of being maltreated or
witnessing IPV during childhood, youth
conduct problems or antisocial behav-
iors, family poverty, parental education,
low social capital, and traditional sex role
norms.2,9-12 However, one potential fac-
tor that has received little research atten-
tion is the presence of childhood attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
symptoms.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-
der is the most commonly diagnosed neu-
robehavioral disorder in childhood, pres-
ent in 3% to 10% of children in the United
States.13 Children and adolescents with
ADHD experience impairment in many
functional areas and studies document that
impairments often persist through ado-
lescence and young adulthood, resulting
in adverse outcomes such as impaired aca-
demic functioning, low self-esteem, poor
social functioning, tobacco, drug, and al-
cohol abuse, delinquency, and conduct

problems.13,14 Studies have found that aggressive crimi-
nal offenders have higher rates of ADHD symptoms in
childhood15 and that childhood ADHD predicts self-
reported violence and violent offending convictions lon-
gitudinally.16 While research has documented a connec-
tion between childhood ADHD and later violence, these
findings have largely focused on violence outside inti-
mate relationships. Given the risk of later interpersonal
violence in youths with elevated levels of ADHD symp-
toms, these may also increase the risk for IPV.
Only a small number of studies have examined the as-
sociation of ADHD symptoms with the risk for IPV. In a
sample of 65 males in a court-mandated domestic vio-
lence treatment program, Mandell17 found that 94% had
ADHD scores above a clinical cutoff. In a college sample
of 157 students, Theriault and Holmberg18 found that the
presence of ADHD symptoms was a small but signifi-
cant predictor of physical relationship aggression. While
both studies suggest a connection between childhood
ADHD and physical IPV, there are a number of limita-
tions to the conclusions that can be drawn. First, both
studies were based on small, selected samples rather than
population samples. Findings thus have limited gener-
alizability, and results should be replicated with larger,
representative samples. Second, neither study distin-
guished between inattention (IA) and hyperactivity/
impulsivity (HI) in the relationship between ADHD symp-
toms and partner aggression. Previous studies have shown
that the relationship between ADHD and other health out-
comes such as smoking and substance abuse are domain-
specific associations, with relationships related to IA or
HI specifically.19-22 Likewise, a previous study using the
same data set as the present study showed a much stron-
ger association of child neglect and abuse with IA symp-
toms than with hyperactivity.23
This article investigates whether links between child-
hood ADHD and young adult physical IPV perpetration
may be attributable to IA or to HI. Furthermore, given
the comorbidity between conduct disorder (CD) and
ADHD (estimated at 25%-75%),24,25 it is critical to ex-
plore whether ADHD is associated with young adult IPV
when the co-occurrence with CD is taken into account
or whether the ADHD-IPV relationship is fully ac-
counted for by CD symptoms. Studies examining the re-
lationships between ADHD and outcomes associated with
violence, such as substance use and abuse, have re-
ported inconsistent findings with respect to the role of
CD. For example, while some studies have reported that
the relationship between ADHD and outcomes disap-
pears when the presence of CD and other externalizing
problems is taken into account, others have found that
ADHD is an independent longitudinal predictor even af-
ter controlling for CD. In addition, studies have found
that ADHD and CD in combination may constitute a
higher risk for negative outcomes than either disorder
alone.26 As CD is a consistent predictor of IPV perpetra-
tion,27,28 the issue of the predictive relationship between
ADHD independent of and comorbid with CD is an im-
portant one to explore.
This study used a US longitudinal and nationally rep-
resentative sample to examine the relationships be-
tween different types of childhood ADHD symptoms and
young adult physical IPV perpetration (resulting in in-
jury or without injury). This study further examined
whether childhood ADHD symptoms predict IPV when
comorbidity with CD is considered.
METHODS
DATA SOURCE AND STUDY SAMPLE
We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Ado-
lescent Health (Add Health), a longitudinal study following a
nationally representative probability sample of adolescents in
grades 7 through 12 in the 1994-1995 school year.29 There are
3 waves of Add Health data available, collected from April to
December 1995, from April to August 1996, and from August
2001 to April 2002. The mean ages of participants during the
3 waves of data collection were 15.7 years, 16.2 years, and 22.0
years, respectively.
Of the 18 835 adolescents who participated in wave I and
were eligible for wave III interview, 2167 individuals could not
be located for wave III and 1228 individuals were located but
did not participate (eg, were unavailable after repeated at-
tempts; had language barriers; were institutionalized or incar-
cerated). In addition, 1109 individuals refused to participate,
and data could not be used for another 9 individuals because
of data anomalies. Thus, there were 14 322 participants (76%
of the original sample) at wave III.30 Analyses of nonresponse
indicate that the wave III sample adequately represents the same
population as the wave I sample when final sampling weights
are used to compute population estimates.30
Our study was based on 14 322 participants interviewed dur-
ing wave I and wave III. Participants were asked in wave III to
report an inventory of all sexual or romantic relationships dur-
ing the past 6 years (since wave I). Participants answered de-
tailed questions (including the IPV questions used in the pres-
ent analyses) for sexual relationships and for those relationships
participants identified as the 2 most important (detailed infor-
mation about relationship selection is available on the Add Health
study Web site, http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth/).
To investigate the relationship between ADHD and young
adult IPV perpetration, 2584 participants were excluded be-
cause they reported no relationships during the preceding 6
years. This reduced the sample for analyses to 11 738 partici-
pants. An additional 500 respondents were excluded because
they were missing information on outcome variables or covar-
iates, resulting in a final analysis sample of 11 238 partici-
pants. For data analysis, data describing participants' sociode-
mographic characteristics and CD symptom self-reports from
wave I of the Add Health study were combined with wave III
self-reported IPV perpetration and retrospective reports of child-
hood ADHD symptoms.
MEASURES
Physical IPV Perpetration
In wave III, in a computer-assisted self-interview, respondents
answered 2 questions reflecting physical IPV perpetration for
each sexual or important intimate relationship during the past
6 years: "How often (if the romantic or sexual relationship lasted
for more than a year, add `in the past year') have you threat-
ened your partner with violence, pushed or shoved him or her,
or thrown something at him or her that could hurt?" and "How
often (if the romantic or sexual relationship lasted for more than
a year, add `in the past year') have you slapped, hit, or kicked
your partner?" The following scale was used for questions re-

lated to the respondent's perpetration of IPV: score of 0, never;
score of 1, once; score of 2, twice; score of 3, 3 to 5 times; score
of 4, 6 to 10 times; score of 5, 11 to 20 times; score of 6, 20 or
more times; and score of 7, did not happen in the past year but
happened prior to that. Responses for each question were re-
coded into 2 categories (yes for scores of 1-7; no for scores of
0) for regression analysis. Perpetration of IPV was defined as
the respondent answering yes to either of the 2 questions. Per-
petration of IPV resulting in injury was assessed with a fol-
low-up question: "How often has your partner had an injury
such as a sprain, bruise, or cut because of a fight with you?"
For those respondents who reported IPV perpetration at least
once during the preceding 6 years, this information was used
to code whether the respondent had perpetrated any IPV re-
sulting in injury (yes for 1 time; no for never).
The severity of IPV has been found to be associated with a va-
riety of mental, physical, and social consequences.31 One crude
indicator of IPV severity is whether a physical injury occurs. Ac-
cording to a national survey, approximately 30% of women who
were injured as a result of IPV received health care for their in-
juries.2 Physical injuries are associated with both the duration of
abuse and dangerousness of the tactics used to inflict abuse (eg,
slap vs kick vs use of a weapon).31 Therefore, IPV with injury was
includedasanoutcomecategoryinthisstudytodeterminewhether
ADHD was associated with more severe IPV. We classified the
respondents into 3 mutually exclusive categories: (1) no IPV per-
petration history (no reported history of IPV perpetration within
any relationship during the preceding 6 years); (2) IPV perpe-
tration without injury (respondent reported IPV toward a part-
ner at least once during the preceding 6 years and did not report
violence resulting in injury); and (3) IPV perpetration resulting
in injury (respondent reported IPV toward a partner at least once
during the preceding 6 years and reported violence resulting in
injury at least once).
ADHD and CD Symptoms
In wave III, participants retrospectively reported ADHD symp-
toms experienced between ages 5 and 12 years using a symptom
checklist. Participants reported the frequency of each DSM-IV
symptomofADHDona4-pointLikertscale:neverorrarely;some-
times; often; or very often. One item (spiteful or vindictive) is not
actually an ADHD symptom and was therefore excluded from
analyses, while 1 DSM-IV impulsivity symptom (often inter-
rupts or intrudes on others) was mistakenly excluded from the
survey. Analyses thus included 9 IA and 8 HI symptoms. Con-
sistent with prior studies using symptom checklists,21,32 a symp-
tom was considered present if it was experienced often or very
often. The total number of symptoms reported (0-9 for IA; 0-8
forHI)wasusedtoexaminetherelationshipbetweenADHDsymp-
toms and IPV. For categorical analyses, ADHD diagnostic cat-
egories were created by categorizing participants who reported
6 or more symptoms of IA, HI, or both (consistent with DSM-IV
ADHD diagnostic criteria).
The measure of CD was also a symptom checklist, which
included responses to the 13 DSM-IV CD symptoms collected
at wave I. Participants were divided into CD diagnostic catego-
ries if they reported 3 or more symptoms of CD (consistent with
DSM-IV criteria).
Sociodemographic Factors
Several sociodemographic factors that have documented asso-
ciations in the literature with IPV perpetration33,34 from the wave
I assessment were included to control for potential confound-
ers. These sociodemographic factors included race/ethnicity,
family structure, primary caregiver education, biological fa-
ther's history of incarceration, family size­adjusted income rela-
tive to federal poverty level, sex, and birth year dummies (to
capture cohort effects). Response categories for each of these
variables are provided in Table 1. Missing data for the father
incarceration variable were treated as a separate category be-
cause 6% of the data were missing. Also, missing data for fam-
ily income were imputed as a continuous variable on the basis
of an equation predicting income based on race/ethnicity, re-
gion, urban or rural status, family structure, receipt of public
assistance, and whether the residence was well kept.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Multinomial logistic regressions were used to analyze the re-
lationships among childhood ADHD (IA or HI symptoms), CD
symptoms, and young adult IPV perpetration, controlling for
sociodemographic factors. The outcome variable was whether
the respondents reported no IPV perpetration, perpetrated IPV
without injury, or perpetrated IPV resulting in injury. Because
the distributions of IA, HI, and CD symptoms were highly
skewed with most participants reporting no symptoms, we log-
transformed the symptom counts to reduce skewness and then

converted them to standard scores to facilitate interpretations
of the corresponding adjusted odds ratios (ORs).20
We also conducted multinomial logistic regressions using
ADHD and CD diagnostic categories as dummy variables. Fi-
nally, to test the robustness of the multinomial logistic regres-
sion results, we ran analyses with diagnostic categories using
propensity score 1-to-1 matched samples. Propensity score
matching is a method used to approximate a randomized con-
trolled setting where cases (subjects with ADHD or CD) and
controls (subjects without ADHD or CD) were compared on
IPV perpetration (without injury or resulting in injury). Suc-
cessful matching can reduce bias introduced by systematic dif-
ferences between subjects with ADHD (or CD) and those with-
out ADHD (or CD) with respect to confounding covariates. A
user-supplied routine in Stata software, PSMATCH2, was used
to perform nearest-neighbor propensity score matching.35 The
propensity score method does not incorporate the survey de-
sign (sample weights or cluster effect) because propensity score
matching uses only a matched subset of the full sample.
To assess sex differences in the associations among ADHD,
CD, and IPV perpetration, sexsymptom dimension (or
sexdiagnostic category) terms were added to each multino-
mial logistic regression model. No significant interactions were
found between sex and each of the ADHD and CD symptom di-
mensions or diagnostic categories in any model tested. Results
indicated that the associations among ADHD, CD, and IPV per-
petration were similar for males and females. Therefore, only re-
sults of regression models including main effects are presented.
Analyses were conducted with Stata SE version 9 statistical
software (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). The Stata soft-
ware allows for control of survey design effects of individuals
clustered in sampling units of school and stratification of geo-
graphic region. Poststratification weights were applied to gen-
erate nationally representative estimates, except for the pro-
pensity score­matched estimates.
RESULTS
SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS
AND SEX DIFFERENCES
Table 1 presents weighted prevalence estimates and 95%
confidence intervals (or standard deviations) of self-
reported ADHD symptoms, CD symptoms, IPV perpe-
tration, and other sample characteristics. The weighted
percentages of respondents reporting ADHD symptoms
and CD symptoms above DSM-IV cutoffs were 8.4% and
12.4% respectively, which were similar to previously re-
ported prevalence rates.21,36,37 Similarly, the reported rate
of IPV perpetration (27.1%, including IPV perpetration
both without injury and resulting in injury) appears com-
parable to prevalence data of IPV victimization from other
national surveys.38
BIVARIATE ANALYSES
Table 2 presents the unadjusted bivariate relation-
ships between ADHD and CD diagnostic categories and
IPV perpetration. Both ADHD and CD were signifi-
cantly associated with higher risk of IPV with and with-
out injury. For predicting IPV resulting in injury, the un-
adjusted effect sizes for ADHD (OR=1.75) and CD
(OR=2.82) are comparable to those for sex (OR=1.71),
race (black vs white; OR=2.19), family structure (single
parent vs both biological parents; OR=1.80), parent edu-
cation level (less than high school vs college; OR=2.03),
and family poverty status (100% vs 400%; OR=2.47).
MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS
Table 3 presents the adjusted ORs and 95% confi-
dence intervals for the associations among IA and HI
symptoms, CD symptoms, and IPV perpetration after con-
trolling for sociodemographic factors. Although HI symp-
toms significantly predicted young adult IPV perpetra-
tion without injury in the partially adjusted model
(controlling for only sociodemographic factors, not CD
and IA), the association was not significant when IA and
CD symptoms were controlled. However, IA symptoms
significantly predicted IPV perpetration without injury
even when HI and CD symptoms were controlled, with
a 1-SD increase in the logarithm of IA symptoms increas-
ing the odds of IPV perpetration without injury by 9%.

Conduct disorder symptoms significantly and indepen-
dently predicted IPV perpetration without injury. A 1-SD
increase in the logarithm of CD symptoms was associ-
ated with a 39% increase in the odds of IPV perpetration
without injury after adjusting for HI and IA.
A different pattern of results was found when associa-
tions of HI and IA symptoms with IPV perpetration result-
ing in injury were analyzed. Hyperactivity/impulsivity sig-
nificantlypredictedIPVperpetrationresultingininjuryafter
controlling for IA and CD, while IA was not significantly
associated with IPV perpetration resulting in injury after
controlling for HI and CD. Conduct disorder significantly
predicted IPV perpetration resulting in injury after con-
trolling for HI and IA, with a 1-SD increase in the loga-
rithm of CD symptoms increasing the odds of IPV perpe-
tration resulting in injury by 63%.
The upper half of Table 4 presents the adjusted ORs
and 95% confidence intervals for the associations be-
tween ADHD diagnostic categories, CD diagnostic cat-
egories, and IPV perpetration controlling for sociode-
mographic factors. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
was not significantly associated with IPV perpetration
without injury, while CD significantly increased the odds
of IPV perpetration without injury by 95% when con-
trolling for ADHD. In analyses predicting IPV perpetra-
tion resulting in injury, ADHD significantly predicted IPV
perpetration resulting in injury (OR=1.71) and re-
mained a significant predictor when controlling for CD
(OR=1.53). Conduct disorder tripled the odds of IPV per-
petration resulting in injury (OR=3.20) when control-
ling for ADHD.
To further examine the unique effect of ADHD on IPV
perpetration, we classified the respondents into 4 mu-
tually exclusive categories based on ADHD and CD symp-
toms: (1) no ADHD or CD (no symptom counts above
DSM-IV criteria for either ADHD or CD; 81.2% of the
sample); (2) ADHD only (symptom counts above DSM-IV
criteria for ADHD but not CD; 6.4% of the sample); (3)
CD only (symptom counts above DSM-IV criteria for CD
but not ADHD; 10.5% of the sample); or (4) ADHD and
CD (symptom counts above DSM-IV criteria for both
ADHD and CD; 1.9% of the sample). The lower half of
Table 4 shows the results of multinomial logistic regres-
sions on the ADHD and CD categories in predicting IPV
perpetration, controlling for sociodemographic factors.
The ADHD only category was not a significant predictor
of IPV perpetration without injury, whereas both the CD
only category and the ADHD and CD category signifi-
cantly predicted IPV perpetration without injury. The
ADHD only category significantly and uniquely pre-
dicted IPV perpetration resulting in injury (OR=1.81).
The results were consistent with those from analyses ex-
amining ADHD and CD diagnostic categories sepa-
rately, suggesting that ADHD by itself is not a signifi-
cant predictor of IPV perpetration without injury.
However, the ADHD only category significantly pre-
dicted IPV perpetration resulting in injury, as did the CD
only category and the ADHD and CD category.

COMMENT
This study examined the relationships among child-
hood ADHD, CD, and IPV perpetration in young adult-
hoodusingapopulation-basedUSsample.Consistentwith
prior studies,28 CD was associated with IPV with and with-
outinjury.Furthermore,retrospectivelyreportedIAsymp-
toms appeared to uniquely contribute to IPV perpetra-
tion without injury after controlling for HI and CD
symptoms. The significant partial relationship between
HI symptoms and IPV perpetration without injury dis-
appeared when IA and CD symptoms were controlled.
The associations with IPV perpetration resulting in in-
jury were in the opposite direction; HI symptoms sig-
nificantly and uniquely predicted IPV perpetration re-
sulting in injury, whereas the relationship between IA
symptoms and IPV perpetration resulting in injury was
not significant when HI and CD symptoms were con-
trolled. There were no significant sex interactions in these
relationships, suggesting similar relationships among
ADHD, CD, and IPV perpetration for males and fe-
males. Our findings suggest that IA and HI are differen-
tially predictive of IPV without injury and IPV resulting
in injury, controlling for CD. Results indicate that diffi-
culties with IA are associated with IPV without injury but
not with IPV resulting in injury. Further research is needed
to understand the connection between IA and IPV with-
out injury and why this association is not found for more
severe forms of violence. While HI was not significantly
associated with IPV perpetration without injury control-
ling for CD and IA, the difference in ORs between HI and
IA was minimal (1.04 vs 1.09, respectively).
Intimatepartnerviolenceresultingininjurywasuniquely
associated with HI but not IA. These findings indicate that
impulse control problems constitute a higher risk for per-
petrationofseriousviolence.Impulsecontrolproblemshave
beenlinkedtoimpulsiveaggressionandproblemswithemo-
tion regulation and frustration tolerance.39 As a limitation
toourfindingsregardingimpulsivity,thereareonly3symp-
toms of impulsivity in the DSM-IV, compared with 9 symp-
toms of IA and 6 of hyperactivity. Additionally, due to er-
ror, the survey included only 2 of the 3 impulsivity
symptoms. As a result, the measurement of impulsivity in
our data was limited. In fact, the association between im-
pulsecontrolproblemsandIPVmaybehigher.Futurestud-
ies are needed to examine the specific phenomena (verbal
impulsivity,relationshipconflict,impulsiveaggression)un-
derlying the associations between IA, HI, and IPV of dif-
fering severity. Research is also needed to examine such
associations in diagnosed samples.
The analyses using categorical classification of ADHD
in predicting IPV perpetration indicated that the rela-
tionship between ADHD and IPV perpetration without
injury is not significant. However, ADHD alone (ie, ADHD
without CD) was a significant predictor of IPV perpe-
tration resulting in injury. The association between prob-
able ADHD and IPV perpetration resulting in injury may
further reflect the contribution of impulsive aggression
and emotion dysregulation.
Our study makes an important contribution to the lit-
erature in understanding the role of ADHD symptoms
in the development of IPV. As predicted, CD symptoms
were a strong and consistent risk factor for violence;
ADHD symptoms and particularly ADHD without the
presence of CD also constituted a significant risk for IPV.
As intervention and violence prevention efforts often fo-
cus on conduct problems, youths with ADHD symp-
toms alone may not receive important services to ad-
dress the development of healthy, nonviolent
relationships. These findings are consistent with those
of longitudinal prospective studies showing that chil-
dren with ADHD but not CD are still at increased risk

for antisocial behavior and criminality in adulthood.40 Ad-
ditionally, propensity score matching analyses indicate
that comorbid ADHD and CD had the largest risk ratios,
particularly for IPV resulting in injury.
These findings suggest that co-occurring disorders may
conferadditionalrisk,consistentwithpreviousfindingsthat
comorbid samples constitute a more virulent form of either
ADHD or CD.25 Given the complex etiological nature of
the relationship between ADHD and CD, our results high-
lighttheimportanceofunderstandingtheseparateandcom-
bined effects of different forms of severe psychopathology
on the development of violence. These data cannot dis-
cern patterns of causality, particularly with regard to the
association of ADHD and CD as well as whether CD might
mediate the influence of ADHD on IPV. Future epidemio-
logicalstudieswithbetterdiagnosticinformationareneeded
to expand on these findings.
One limitation of this study involved the retrospective
self-reportofADHDsymptoms.Therewasnoinformation
on childhood ADHD diagnosis and treatment to validate
the data. It might be particularly burdensome for youths
withADHDtorecallchildhoodexperiences.Furthermore,
there is a lack of consensus on the most valid approaches
toestablishingADHDdiagnosisinadolescenceandadult-
hood, with the role of self-report data under dispute. Our
studyusedanADHDsymptomchecklistratherthandiag-
nosesusingclinicianassessments.Inparticular,therewas

mentsarepreferableindiagnosingADHDandCD,theuse

thatADHDsymptomsmusthavebeenpresentpriortoage
7years,retrospectivereportsareoftennecessary.Research
hasalsosupportedthereliabilityandvalidityofself-reports
in adulthood.41,42
The measures of IPV are an additional limitation. In-
timate partner violence was assessed using only self-
reports and thus are subject to all possible biases and limi-
tations inherent to this form of measurement, such as
recall bias, social desirability, and reporting bias.43 As an-
other concern, this study is limited in the number of ques-
tions available to define IPV. The 3 questions in the Add
Health study do not capture all forms of partner vio-
lence assessed by validated scales for IPV, and no infor-
mation was collected about the causes or function of vio-
lence.43 Future work is needed to replicate our findings
with data using validated scales and to examine causes
and contextual influences of IPV.
Another limitation is that IPV was primarily mea-
sured on a subset of relationships. It is unclear whether
the study findings would be the same with a more di-
verse sample of relationships. However, the rate of IPV
perpetration based on the sexual or important relation-
ships is consistent with prevalence data of IPV victim-
ization from other national surveys.38 An additional limi-
tation is the potential for selection bias in that the study
focuses on young adults who reported intimate relation-
ships in the preceding 6 years. However, the study ex-
amined the distribution of ADHD and CD between those
who reported intimate relationships and those who did
not and found that the percentage of those reporting
ADHD and CD were approximately equal (not statisti-
cally significant). Moreover, participants who remained
in the sample did not differ from those who were ex-
cluded with respect to age (mean, 21.8 vs 21.9 years, re-
spectively), sex (50% vs 53% female, respectively), and
race/ethnicity (69% vs 61% white, respectively).
Finally, imputation methods were used for handling the
more than 20% of missing values of reported family in-
come. To check the robustness of results, we performed
the statistical analysis with complete data only (ie, limited
tothosewhoreportedfamilyincome).Themagnitudesand
significance of the ORs obtained from the complete case
analysis are similar to those obtained from analysis using
imputation, providing some assurance that imputation had
little effect on study conclusions.
Our findings have important implications for inter-
vention and prevention. Evidence-based treatment for
ADHD includes stimulant medication, behavioral par-
ent training, and school-based behavioral treatment.44
While these approaches are effective in reducing the im-
pairment of children with ADHD, there are very few evi-
dence-basedtreatmentapproachesforadolescents.44-46 Our
findings suggest that youths with ADHD are at signifi-
cant risk for experiencing partner conflict and perpetrat-
ing IPV, yet involvement in romatic relationships typi-
cally begins in adolescence, when youths with ADHD are
least likely to receive treatment. These findings provide
support for the need to continue evidence-based ser-
vices for adolescents with ADHD and to address healthy
relationship skills. The same is true for CD as services
often do not extend into adolescence and typically fo-
cus on delinquency prevention but have less explicit em-
phasis on development of healthy, nonviolent dating re-
lationships. Couples in whom 1 partner experiences
clinically significant levels of IA, HI, and/or conduct prob-
lems may be at elevated risk for IPV. Traditional ap-
proaches to prevent IPV may not be sufficient for those
couples if they do not address the specific issues related
to ADHD and CD.
