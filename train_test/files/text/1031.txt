the Neighborhood Make?

Objectives. Racial differences in self-rated health at older ages are well documented. African Americans consistently
report poorer health, even when education, income, and other health status indicators are controlled. The extent to which
neighborhood-level characteristics mediate this association remains largely unexplored. We ask whether neighborhood
social and economic resources help to explain the self-reported health differential between African Americans and Whites.
Methods. Using the 1990 Decennial Census, the 1994­1995 Project on Human Development in Chicago
Neighborhoods­Community Survey, and selected years of the 1991­2000 Metropolitan Chicago Information Center­
Metro Survey, we examine the impact of neighborhood structure and social organization on self-rated health for a sample
of Chicago residents aged 55 and older (N ¼ 636). We use multilevel modeling techniques to examine both individual and
neighborhood-level covariates.
Results. Findings indicate that affluence, a neighborhood structural resource, contributes positively to self-rated health
and attenuates the association between race and self-rated health. When the level of affluence in a community is low,
residential stability is negatively related to health. Collective efficacy, a measure of neighborhood social resources, is not
associated with health for this older population.
Discussion. Analyses incorporating individual and neighborhood-level contextual indicators may further our
understanding of the complex association between sociodemographic factors and health.
``HOW WOULD you rate your health? Would you consider
your health excellent, good, fair, or poor?'' This query,
now standard in social surveys of health and well-being, has
revealed a curious pattern in the responses of older African
American and White individuals: African Americans consis-
tently report poorer health, even when age, chronic health
conditions, and a host of additional individual-level covariates
are considered (Clark & Maddox, 1992; Mutchler & Burr,
1991). In 1995, the age-adjusted percentage of African
American persons who reported fair or poor health was 15.4%
as compared with 8.7% for their White counterparts (National
Center for Health Statistics, 1998). Although the gap between
Blacks and Whites has narrowed slightly in recent years, it is
still most pronounced among those at older ages: Over 44% of
African Americans aged 75 and older reported fair or poor
health as compared with 31% of Whites (Kington & Nickens,
2001). Whereas some research does suggest that Blacks and
Whites may evaluate their health differently (Ferraro & Kelley-
Moore, 2001; Johnson & Wolinsky, 1994), evidence from
Andersen, Mullner, and Cornelius (1987) and other psycho-
metric investigations of the validity of self-reports of health
have led researchers to believe that, in general, differences
detected between groups are real rather than an artifact of the
measurement method (Cunningham, Hays, Burton, & Kington,
2000; Gibson, 1991). In short, extant research offers strong
evidence of a substantive race differential in self-reports of
health but, as yet, has not yielded a convincing explanation for
this discrepancy.
Because Black race is associated with lower socioeconomic
status (SES) and lower SES with poor health, research has
focused on the study of individual-level SES as a mediating
variable between race and self-rated health (Mutchler & Burr,
1991). In general, this work hypothesizes that education,
income, and wealth account for racial differences in self-rated
health; that is, once these factors are incorporated into the
analysis, any difference by race should disappear. Results are
mixed, with most research continuing to report an unexplained
health differential between African Americans and Whites
(Kington & Nickens, 2001). In the case of self-reported
functional status, Clark and Maddox (1992) note that Blacks
report poorer functional status than non-Blacks even when
income and education are controlled.
Absent from these analyses is the social context in which
evaluations of health are reported. Although individual-level
social and economic indicators clearly affect health (Williams
& Collins, 1995), there is a growing body of literature linking
the social environment in which people reside with their
health (Browning & Cagney, 2002; Diez Roux, Nieto, &
Muntaner, 1997; Kawachi & Berkman, 2003; Robert & Lee,
2002). Research on the relationship between place and health
varies by geographic unit (e.g., state, county, community
area), but evidence points to the neighborhood in which
people live as a meaningful entity; the proximal social and
economic environment may contribute to health via, for
instance, noxious conditions, stress, or limited access to care
(Krause, 1996). In this article, we extend previous research by

turning our attention to these characteristics of community. In
doing so, we aim to explore whether neighborhood social
context is reflected in self-assessments of health and whether
it has any explanatory power in an examination of racial
differences in self-assessed health. To guide our investigation,
we employ collective efficacy theory (Sampson, Raudenbush,
& Earls, 1997). This theoretical perspective emphasizes the
role of neighborhood-based economic and social resources in
enhancing individual health. We hypothesize that some part of
the racial disparity in older persons' self-assessed health can
be attributed to variation in these neighborhood-level factors.
We focus this investigation on older persons both because the
race differential in self-reported health is greater at older ages
and because we expect the role of neighborhood to be more
important for older than younger adults (Robert & Li, 2001).
Our hypothesis is grounded in theoretical and empirical
propositions that point to the salience of neighborhood context
for older adults. Many adults age in place; fully one-third of
older adults have lived in their communities for 30 years or
longer (Bryan & Morrison, 2004). Length of residence
implies a commitment to the community, and, indeed, this
is borne out by the data. Putnam's research (2000) indicates
that a community with a disproportionate number of elderly
residents is likely to have a more active neighborhood watch,
better social services, and, in general, greater engagement in
civic affairs. Although older adults may have more time, and
a greater tendency, to engage in community life, they are,
practically speaking, also much more dependent on the
context that their community provides. Neighborhood context
may in large part determine whether it is feasible to take
a walk, go food shopping, or remain engaged in community-
based activities such as church (Robert & Li, 2001; Ross,
2000). The circumference of social space may constrict as one
ages, making the immediate community environment all the
more important. Indeed, Balfour and Kaplan (2002) found that
older adults who live in neighborhoods with poorer-quality
environments (e.g., high crime, heavy traffic, excessive noise,
poor lighting) experience a greater risk of functional de-
terioration. Krause (1996) also found that deteriorating
neighborhood conditions exerted an independent effect on
health. In general, the antecedent literature examining the link
between individual well-being and the level of neighborhood
criminal activity indicates that higher crime rates are
associated with stress, community withdrawal, and fear of
leaving one's home (Ferraro, 1995). For older persons, this
exposure may exacerbate an already compromised health
state, and there may be few mechanisms in place to buffer
these negative effects (Thompson & Krause, 1998).
We investigate the health effects of neighborhood context
using a multilevel approach. This provides the opportunity to
disentangle individual and neighborhood-level effects (Rauden-
bush & Bryk, 2002). The analyses employ data from the 1990
Census, the 1994­1995 Project on Human Development in
Chicago Neighborhoods­Community Survey, and the 1995,
1997, and 1999 Metropolitan Chicago Information Center­
Metro Survey. This combination of data sources offers a unique
opportunity to explore the role of neighborhood context in the
association between race and self-reported health status.
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
Collective efficacy theory emphasizes neighborhood social
resources in the form of mutual trust and solidarity (social
cohesion) and expectations for action (informal social control)
in explaining the impact of neighborhood structural factors on
residents' well-being (see Sampson et al. [1997] and Sampson,
Morenoff, & Earls [1999] for an extended discussion of the
collective efficacy framework and its specific operationaliza-
tion). The collective efficacy framework and the social
disorganization perspective on which it is based (Shaw &
McKay, 1969) point to two key structural conditions thought to
attenuate neighborhood social cohesion and informal social
control: the prevalence of poverty, or, more generally, economic
disadvantage, and the aggregate stability of neighborhood
residents. Extending this basic model, recent contributions to
collective efficacy theory have stressed the critical role of
neighborhood affluence in generating the social conditions that
support a cohesive and trusting environment (Morenoff,
Sampson, & Raudenbush, 2001; Sampson et al., 1999). This
work builds, in part, on Wilson's theoretical framework (1987),
which emphasizes the benefits of economic heterogeneity and
the presence of affluent residents (i.e., middle and upper-middle
class). Relatively little attention, however, has been paid to the
role of affluence in the literature on neighborhood and health
(Browning & Cagney, 2003; Robert, 1999; Wen, Browning, &
Cagney, 2003); socioeconomically advantaged residents may
have the resources to mobilize on behalf of a health-enhancing
environment. The prevalence of economic resources and
associated higher levels of collective efficacy may contribute
to the provision of health services, the maintenance of safe
recreational space, and the management of neighborhood
physical hazards--all critical for community-dwelling older
adults. Specific mechanisms through which collective efficacy,
in particular, may contribute to health include the social control
of health-related behaviors and conditions and the positive
psychosocial processes that generate a protective effect for
health (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988). Figure 1 illustrates
the connections between neighborhood structure, social organi-
zation, and health.
Self-assessments of health may reflect the impact of collective
efficacy more readily than other measures of health status due to
the nature and scope of the self-rated health question. Recent
research indicates that self-assessments of health tap energy,

active functioning, and perceptions about social support
(Benyamini, Idler, Leventhal, & Leventhal, 2000). These do-
mains may be particularly responsive to environmental change;
functional well-being and energy, for instance, could be con-
siderably lessened in a community context where one is afraid to
walk outside. In addition, the relationship between collective
efficacy and self-rated health may be heightened for the very
young and the very old--vulnerable population groups may
depend more readily on the community to facilitate daily
interactions and transitions (e.g., walking to school, grocery
shopping, attending church).
METHODS
Data
Three data sources are used to explore the mediating effect of
neighborhood on the relationship between race and self-rated
health at older ages. They are the 1990 Decennial Census; the
1994­1995 Project on Human Development in Chicago
Neighborhoods­Community Survey (PHDCN-CS); and the
1995, 1997, and 1999 Metropolitan Chicago Information
Center­Metro Survey (MCIC-MS). The outcome of interest,
self-rated health, and thus the sample N come from the MCIC-
MS. Neighborhood-level characteristics are constructed from
the other two data sets and are merged into the individual-level
MCIC-MS. MCIC-MS respondents were geocoded using
census tract identifiers and were merged with the PHDCN-CS
on that basis. The sample was restricted to individuals 55 years
of age or older (N ¼ 636). Table 1 illustrates the data sets and
sample years used in this study.
Measures of neighborhood structural characteristics are taken
from the 1990 Census. These include measures of affluence,
poverty, and residential stability. Measures of neighborhood
social processes are constructed from the PHDCN-CS (the text
to follow explains how these variables were constructed, but the
individual-level sample size is not directly relevant to this
analysis because we use only summary covariates constructed
from this data set). The PHDCN-CS asks questions about the
community in which respondents live. It is a probability sample
of 8,782 residents of Chicago, aged 18 and older. The study
combined 847 census tracts into 343 larger, ecologically
meaningful ``neighborhood clusters'' (NCs)--aggregations of
two to three census tracts designed to more accurately represent
the practical and ecological boundaries of Chicago neighbor-
hoods. NCs were designed to maintain relative population
homogeneity with respect to racial/ethnic, socioeconomic,
housing, and family structure characteristics (NCs average
roughly 8,000 people) (Earls & Buka, 1997; PHDCN, 2004;
Sampson et al., 1997). The sampling strategy of the PHDCN-CS
was intended to capture a within-NC sample size sufficient to
estimate neighborhood characteristics based on aggregated
individual-level data. The purpose of this strategy was to ensure
the reliability of neighborhood-level measures of social pro-
cesses. The response rate was 75%. Our analysis includes
residents from 246 Chicago neighborhoods. Neighborhoods not
included in this analysis were those that did not have an
adequate population base 55 years or over. The dependent
variable and individual-level predictors are drawn from the
MCIC-MS. The MCIC-MS is a serial cross-section of adults
ages 18 and older who reside in the city of Chicago (Taylor,
2001). The response rate for the MCIC-MS was approximately
55% across the 10 cross-sectional samples. Because the MCIC-
MS did not achieve as high a response rate as the PHCDN-CS,
we conducted a validity assessment by comparing the PHDCN-
CS with selected years from the MCIC-MS. The distributions
across demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and race
in these MCIC-MS waves were similar, indicating that the
MCIC-MS adequately represents the Chicago population.
Dependent measure. --Our dependent variable is a measure
of self-rated health (Goldstein, Siegel, & Boyer, 1984; Wilson &
Kaplan, 1995). The psychometric and health status assessment
literatures document that self-rated health measures are reliable
and exhibit construct and criterion validity (George, 2001;
Patrick & Erickson, 1993). For instance, self-rated health has
been shown to predict mortality (Idler & Benyamini, 1997;
Kaplan, Salonen, Cohen, Brand, Syme, & Puska, 1988),
morbidity (Ferraro, Farmer, & Wybraniec, 1997), subsequent
disability (Idler & Kasl, 1995), and health care utilization
(Malmstrom, Sundquist, & Johansson, 1999). In addition, it has
been used in prior studies examining the link between
neighborhood context and health (Browning & Cagney, 2002;
Krause, 1996). Although validity assessments of the self-rated
health measure across dimensions such as gender, race, and
ethnicity still merit further exploration (Idler & Benyamini,
1997), initial investigations indicate that its predictive capacity
is comparable for Latinos, African Americans, and Whites
(Finch, Hummer, Reindl, & Vega, 2002; Gibson, 1991; Johnson
& Wolinsky, 1994). The MCIC-MS asks, ``In general, would
you say your health is: excellent, good, fair, or poor?'' We treat
self-rated health as an ordered categorical variable.
Independent measures. --To capture the economic profile of
the community, we focus on the prevalence of poor and upper/
middle-class residents as defined by income from the 1990
Census. Neighborhood poverty is operationalized as the
proportion of residents with incomes below the 1990 federal
poverty threshold ($13,359 for a household of four). Neighbor-
hood affluence is operationalized as the percentage of house-
holds with incomes $50,000 or over. A residential stability scale
was constructed based on scores from a factor analysis of
measures of housing tenure (percentage living in the same house
since at least 1985) and the percentage of housing occupied by
owners (factor loadings exceeded .75). (The analysis employed
alpha-scoring factor analysis with an oblique rotation. Scores
from principal components analyses yielded the same pattern of
effects in multivariate analyses of health. Analyses are available
from the first author upon request.)

Collective efficacy is operationalized through combining the
PHDCN-CS measures of social cohesion and informal social
control. Social cohesion was constructed from a cluster of
conceptually related items measuring the respondent's level of
agreement (on a 5-point scale) with the following statements: (a)
``People around here are willing to help their neighbors.'' (b)
``This is a close-knit neighborhood.'' (c) ``People in this
neighborhood can be trusted.'' (d) ``People in this neighborhood
generally don't get along with each other'' (reverse coded).
Health-related informal social control was tapped through
respondent agreement with the following: (a) ``If I were sick, I
could count on my neighbors to shop for groceries for me.'' (b)
``You can count on adults in this neighborhood to watch out that
children are safe and don't get in trouble.'' An additional
informal social control item asked respondents how likely it was
that people in their neighborhood would intervene if a fight
broke out in front of their house. The informal social control
items tap expectations for action with respect to health-related
social support as well as neighborhood supervision of
potentially hazardous conditions or violent situations. The
seven items were combined to form a single scale of health-
related collective efficacy. The reliability of the collective
efficacy scale is .73.
Individual-level variables are taken from the 1995, 1997, and
1999 waves of the MCIC-MS. Self-rated health and relevant
health background controls were simultaneously assessed in
these three waves of the MCIC-MS only. We chose to pool these
3 years to increase our ability to examine differences in self-
rated health; we include a variable for interview year to capture
any time trends in this dependent variable. Table 2 reports
descriptive statistics on the outcome, self-rated health, and key
demographic background and health-related items. These
include measures of gender, age, race/ethnicity (Black, Latino
versus White/other), income, education level, and marital status
(married versus single or cohabiting). Health background
measures include insurance coverage (Medicaid, Medicare, or
private insurance versus no insurance coverage) and indicator
variables measuring health-risk behavior (exercise, physician-
indicated weight problem). In all, the combination of these three
datasets provides a uniquely rich source of individual and
neighborhood-level predictors of health.
Analytic Strategy
The clustering of respondents within Chicago's neighbor-
hoods renders standard ordinary least squares (OLS) techniques
inappropriate owing to the likely underestimation of standard
errors. We use generalized linear latent and mixed models
(GLLAMM; Skrondal & Rabe-Hesketh, 2004) to estimate two-
level ordinal logit models. GLLAMM uses adaptive quadrature
to perform maximum likelihood estimation of multilevel
models. It adjusts standard errors for the effects of the clustering
of cases within neighborhoods. Our sample of neighborhoods
contained, on average, 2.6 respondents. Although the within-
neighborhood n is small, this does not pose an estimation
problem in the case of random intercept (as opposed to random
slope) models (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). Hierarchical tech-
niques are used not only in our overall analysis but also in the
construction of selected covariates. For instance, to correct in-
dependent neighborhood-level measures of collective efficacy
for missing data, we use empirical Bayes residuals from a three-
level item-response model of the component items of the
collective efficacy scale.
In baseline models, we examine the association between
demographic and background characteristics and self-rated
health. These individual-level characteristics are considered
exogenous in the models and partially determinative of
neighborhood of residence. We then enter structural (e.g.,
poverty, affluence) and social process (e.g., collective efficacy)
measures. The analyses reported are two-level hierarchical
ordinal logit models of self-rated health with positive coef-
ficients associated with poorer self-rated health.
RESULTS
Our results consist of descriptive statistics, stratified by
race, for our individual-level variables (Table 2), a correlation

matrix for our neighborhood-level variables (Table 3), and
a series of hierarchical ordinal logit models predicting self-
rated health (Table 4). We include a predicted probability plot
to illustrate the interaction term included in the last model of
Table 4 (Figure 2). These models introduce demographic and
individual-level SES, health, and neighborhood-level variables
sequentially. With this approach, we illustrate how each
dimension contributes to our outcome, self-rated health, and
how these dimensions alter the racial disparity observed.
The descriptive statistics in Table 2 include our de-
mographic indicators, individual-level SES measures, and
our health variables. Included are results for the entire sample
and for the Black and White samples separately. Black
respondents report fair/poor health at a much higher rate (.45
vs .27). The income distributions differ for Blacks and
Whites, with far fewer Black respondents falling into the
higher-income levels. A similar phenomenon is true for
education: Approximately 25% of the White respondents hold
a college diploma or higher as compared with 13% of Black
respondents. In terms of health, African American respondents
are much more likely to have a weight problem and to have
asthma and high blood pressure. They also are more likely to
be Medicaid recipients, a result reflective of both economic
status and, potentially, access to quality health care.
The correlations presented in Table 3 show the extent to
which the neighborhood-level variables in our analyses are
interrelated. As anticipated, poverty and affluence have a high
negative correlation. Affluence and collective efficacy are the
two variables with the highest positive association (r ¼ .54),
suggesting that affluence might aid the ability of neighbors
to know one another and their social context. Age structure
(population aged 55 and over) is associated with poverty (r ¼
À.49), affluence (r ¼ .40), and collective efficacy (r ¼ .37),
perhaps signaling that older persons have accrued more
wealth and are more connected to/knowledgeable about the
neighborhood. Overall, the correlations illustrate that these
variables are tapping relatively unique components of the
neighborhood social context.
Table 4 reports the results of hierarchical ordinal logit
models predicting self-rated health. Model 1 shows the
coefficients of a model predicting poorer self-rated health
based on demographic background and individual-level SES.
Black race is associated with lower self-rated health. African
American older persons are 77% more likely to report fair or
poor health than their White counterparts (p , .001), after
adjusting for age, interview year, Latino ethnicity, gender,
marital status, education, and income (note that age was
associated with lower self-rated health in the bivariate case but
is no longer significant in the full individual-level model).
Consistent with expectations and previous research, education
and income are protective against poor health, with the greatest
impact coming from additional years of schooling (each level
reduces the likelihood of poorer health by approximately
43%).

RACE, HEALTH, AND NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT S185
Model 2 adds health background measures. Controlling for
these indicators results in modest reductions in the coefficient
for Black race as compared with Model 1: African Americans
are now 65% more likely to report fair/poor health as compared
with Whites (p , .01). Older persons who have a physician-
diagnosed weight problem are 2.3 times more likely to report
a poorer state of health (p , .001).
Model 3 adds neighborhood structural characteristics to this
set of nested models: age structure (percentage of the population
aged 55 or older), residential stability, and poverty. While
none of these three variables is significant under this model
specification, the coefficient for Black race decreased about
22%.
Model 4 substitutes percentage affluent for percentage
impoverished but otherwise maintains the same model specifi-
cation. Affluence, unlike poverty, significantly reduces the
likelihood of reporting poorer self-rated health; a 1-unit increase
in the percentage of neighborhood households with incomes
equal to or greater than $50,000 leads to a 2.5% reduction in the
likelihood of reporting poorer health. In addition, residential
stability has emerged as a significant predictor of self-rated
health. A standard deviation increase in the residential stability
scale (SD ¼ 1.03) leads to a 24% increase in the likelihood of
reporting poorer health. Important to this analysis, the race
coefficient was rendered insignificant (percentage change
approximately 60% as compared with 22% in Model 3).
Model 5 includes these neighborhood-level variables but now
adds collective efficacy. Collective efficacy is not significant in
this model specification (nor does the effect of collective
efficacy vary with time [additional analyses available from the
first author upon request]). This finding is inconsistent with the
expected beneficial effect on health based on collective efficacy
theory. Residential stability maintains its importance, with its
effect increasing slightly. Affluence is again protective against
poorer self-rated health. Race, as in the prior model, is no longer
a significant predictor of health status.
Model 6 introduces an interaction between affluence and
residential stability, acknowledging that the effect of residen-
tial stability may vary by the level of affluence in
a community. The interaction term is significant (p , .10)
and indicates that as affluence increases, the magnitude of the
detrimental effect of residential stability on self-rated health
decreases.
Figure 2 illustrates this relationship graphically. It shows
the predicted probability of fair or poor health by residential
stability and two levels of neighborhood affluence (the 25th
and 75th percentiles). We observe that affluence is protective
of health, regardless of stability. When affluence is low, the
effect of residential stability is negatively related to health.
The coefficient for race does not change appreciably.
A possible threat to the conclusion that neighborhood
affluence exerts a unique effect on health status relates to the
potential reliability mismatch between neighborhood and
individual-level measures of income. Arguably, neighborhood
affluence could be tappingindividual income tothe extentthat the
latter is measured with error (a notorious flaw of survey-based
self-reports of income). To address this possibility, we used
errors-in-variables regression (Fuller, 1987) to impose various
levels of reliability on the individual-level income measure. The
neighborhood affluence measure remained a significant predictor
of health status, even when we assumed a conservative level of
reliability for individual income (.64). These results suggest that

the effect of neighborhood affluence is real and not merely a
function of inaccurately measured income at the individual level.
DISCUSSION
The aim of this work was to introduce a neighborhood-level
analysis into the literature on race and self-rated health, thereby
determining whether neighborhood-level factors might explain
why older African Americans rate their health more poorly than
Whites, all else being equal. We knew from previous work that
individual-level SES was an important predictor of self-rated
health (Williams & Collins, 1995) and that individual-level SES
explained some, but not all, of the race differential in self-rated
health (Mutchler & Burr, 1991). In addition, we knew that
neighborhood factors such as dilapidated housing, noise, and
traffic were associated with older persons poorer ratings of
health (Krause, 1996). What we did not know was whether
neighborhood-level SES and neighborhood social organization,
measured by residential stability, poverty, affluence, and
collective efficacy, had any explanatory power in the relation-
ship between race and health status. Given the salience of
neighborhood context to the lives of older persons, our
expectation was that these neighborhood-level factors would
explain, at least in part, the race differential in self-rated health.
Does the introduction of neighborhood-level factors close the
gap between Blacks and Whites? We find some evidence that it
does. Consistent with previous research, we found that older
urban African Americans have a substantially higher likelihood
of reporting low levels of health when compared with White
respondents. Our analyses were intended to address a number of
existing hypotheses offered to account for this consistent health
differential by race. First, we considered SES as manifest in
educational achievement and current income. Although SES
was strongly predictive of current self-reports of health
(reflected principally in education but also present in income),
these factors accounted for only a proportion of the race effect.
We then investigated the mediating effects of health back-
ground. The health behavior literature has suggested that
African Americans are exposed to a higher risk of poor health
due to health-compromising behavioral orientations including
poor diet and lack of exercise. We also considered the
contribution of health insurance coverage to the risk of poorer
health. Only a weight problem was associated with lower self-
reported health, and this did not account for a substantial
proportion of the race effect. Marital status and insurance
coverage--potentially important to self-rated health at younger
ages--do not appear to be predictive in this case (Ferraro &
Kelley-Moore, 2001). In this older cohort, marital status and
insurance coverage may not differentiate groups in the same
manner or for the same set of reasons (because of widowhood
and Medicare coverage, respectively). Once again, the unique
negative effect of Black race remained significant in this model.
Relying on collective efficacy theory to motivate our
investigation, we then considered the role of neighborhood
social context in mediating the effect of race on health. Drawing
on collective efficacy theory's emphasis on the availability of
economic and social resources at the neighborhood level, we
examined the effects of the proportion of residents in both
impoverished and affluent households and a latent indicator of
residential stability as structural indicators of community SES.
Consistent with expectations, neighborhood affluence exerted
a strong and substantial effect on health, even after controlling
for individual-level SES and health background. Moreover,
neighborhood affluence further reduced the negative coefficient
for Black race and rendered it insignificant. The proportional
reduction in the race coefficient was nontrivial: Older African
American residents may benefit substantially from the presence
of economically advantaged neighbors with the capacity to
mobilize on behalf of a health-enhancing and health-protective
environment.
At odds with theoretical expectations, however, we found that
residential stability was positively associated with poorer health.
Although inconsistent with collective efficacy theory, this result
nevertheless parallels other recent findings that question the
beneficial role of residential stability and the social processes
with which it may be associated. Sampson and colleagues
(1997), for instance, found that residential stability was
positively associated with homicide rates in Chicago commu-
nities. Prior analyses (Browning & Cagney, 2003) also have
offered evidence that the negative effect of residential stability
on health holds for younger populations as well. The effect
of residential stability may reflect processes described by
Wilson (1987), who suggests that, for some communities, sta-
bility may not produce or reflect social organization but rather
economic and social isolation and constrained mobility (Ross,
Reynolds, & Geis, 2001).
Finally, our operationalization of the collective efficacy
concept--tapping social cohesion and health-related informal
social control--did not predict self-rated health for older adults.
Previous analyses indicate that collective efficacy is protective
for a younger adult population (Browning & Cagney, 2002).
Thus, collective efficacy, in its current conceptualization, may
not be tapping the precise elements most important to older
persons. Future work will attempt to validate this measure
across age strata.
These results must be interpreted in light of study limitations.
First, our sample size may hamper the ability to make
comparisons between race groups and limit us in our capacity
to test interactions among the variables. Second, although self-
rated health is a robust measure of general health status, it
would be beneficial to include other metrics and to compare and
contrast these findings with other evaluations of health. Health
is a multidimensional construct, so additional measures would
add credence to these findings. Although our existing data
preclude this approach, additional health information, particu-
larly in longitudinal form, would further elucidate the
association between race and health. Third, our three data
sources span a 9-year range; in some cases, the evaluations of
health occurred appreciably later than the structural assessments
of community. Although we are fortunate that our data structure
is in keeping with the causal sequence indicated by our
theoretical model--neighborhood structural measures from the
census first, neighborhood social process measures from the
PHDCN-CS second, and health measures from the MCIC-MS
third--we recognize that neighborhood structure may have
changed over time. To investigate this possibility, we explored
cross-level interactions with time. None of the interactions was
significant, apart from residential stability; in no case did cross-
level interactions alter the effects of our key theoretical
variables. Nonetheless, it would be preferable if the range of
RACE, HEALTH, AND NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT S187
years was tighter. Fourth, our analysis is limited to Chicago
neighborhoods and thus cannot be easily generalized to other
settings. We do believe, however, that this combination of data
sources allowed us to gain insight into urban social processes.
In this way, our results may be elucidating for other U.S.
urban centers.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, is the larger issue of
causality and the causal order implied by our theoretical and
empirical approach. We begin with the premise that a neighbor-
hood's social context contributes to the health and well-being of
the individuals who reside within it. This is a plausible assump-
tion, and one made by governmental organizations such as the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, whose
landmark program Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is based on
the notion that the context in which people reside affects not only
their physical health but also their mental health, their academic
achievement, and their success in the job market (Orr et al.,
2003). Decisions to reside in one community over another,
however, are complex; in the absence of initiatives such as the
one described above, individuals may select into a particular
community based on one or any number of characteristics that
we are unable to identify via current data sources or conventional
research mechanisms. For instance, if illness drives neighbor-
hood location, then it is not the neighborhood itself that leaves an
imprint on individual health, but rather individuals who collect
in a neighborhood who confer a summary assessment of poor
health. We are unable to determine when, or why, the individuals
in our study moved into their current communities. We believe,
however, that our theoretical and empirical approach lends cre-
dence to the notion that the social and physical environment
matters, apart from duration of residence. We included three
distinct data sets--the self-rated health measure and the neigh-
borhood evaluation from two different sources, ameliorating
concerns that illness would cause one to evaluate one's environ-
ment negatively--along with a rich set of controls and an
advanced statistical approach. We did, to the extent that our data
would allow, follow the general approach suggested by Diez
Roux (2004) and Oakes (2004); we began with a theory, we
approached it with data that had some temporal sequence, and
we employed a modeling strategy that accounted for shared
variance. By no means does our approach ensure that a causal
process is at work, but it employs some of the best contemporary
tools and strategies to explore it. We also conducted a reliability
analysis, uncommon in neighborhood effects research. Our reli-
ability analysis indicated that neighborhood affluence remained
a significant predictor of health status, even when we assumed
a conservative level of reliability for the individual income mea-
sure, suggesting that the effect of neighborhood affluence is real.
Increasingly, evidence in the literature indicates that neigh-
borhood does influence health, providing additional evidence
that an underlying causal process may be at work. For instance,
a recent article by Johnson and Schoeni (2004) uses the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to tease apart family from
community effects (the initial 1968 sample of the PSID was
clustered, with many PSID families living in the same
neighborhood--this allowed for a comparison of siblings living
together versus unrelated individuals living nearby). They find
that although the childhood neighbor correlations are smaller
than those of the siblings, neighborhood relationships remain;
disparities in neighborhood background account for between
one third and one fourth of the variation in health status among
men in midlife. Evidence from the MTO initiative--to our
knowledge, the closest contemporary example of an experi-
mental design in neighborhood location--indicates that neigh-
borhood context contributes to the health of both children
and adults (Kling, Liebman, Katz, & Sanbonmatsu, 2004;
Leventhal & Brooks-Gunn, 2003).
Racial differences in self-rated health, along with research
that investigates the antecedent conditions that might inform
it (e.g., access to care, differential procedure rates) (Ayanian,
Cleary, Weissman, & Epstein, 1999; Petersen, Wright, Peterson,
& Daley, 2002), have occupied considerable attention in recent
years. Discrepancies in individual-level factors such as
education and income have indeed helped to explain a pro-
portion of the differential; evidence suggests, however, that
these alone do not fully account for the persistent disparities in
health between Whites and African Americans. Our findings
contribute to research on race and health by highlighting the
importance of the presence of neighborhood resources--
specifically, the proportion of residents with relatively high
incomes--in accounting for the residual racial difference in
health between African Americans and Whites. Our analyses
demonstrate the specific importance of affluent residents in
contributing to the health of older residents, as distinct from the
hypothesized opposite effect of the presence of poor residents.
In exploring this relationship for older persons in particular, we
acknowledge that the neighborhood effect is likely cumulative.
Future research efforts will be aimed at further unpacking the
role of neighborhood context in the lives of older residents,
including explorations of other health status measures (partic-
ularly physical function and activities of daily living limita-
tions), additional community context variables, and analyses
that examine the extent to which these variables differentially
contribute to health and well-being across the life course.
