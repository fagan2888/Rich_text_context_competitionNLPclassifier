in polymyositis: Inflammation
and regeneration
Yu-Qiong Zou1, Wei-Dong Jin2 and Ya-Song Li1
Abstract
Objective: To elucidate the clinical significance of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)
serum concentration in patients with polymyositis.
Methods: Thirty-six patients with polymyositis were enrolled. Serum samples were obtained
and stored to detect MIF and interleukin (IL)-6 using commercially available enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay kits. The relationships between these cytokines and clinical data were analyzed.
Results: The serum MIF concentration was significantly lower in patients in remission (34.74Æ 17.75)
and in healthy controls (38.87Æ 9.30ng/ml) than that in patients with active polymyositis (50.04
Æ 23.84ng/ml). There were no significant differences between healthy controls and patients in remission.
The serum IL-6 concentration in patients with active polymyositis (19.67Æ 7.16pg/ml) was significantly
higher than that in patients in remission (15.81Æ 4.00pg/ml) and controls (8.14Æ 3.71pg/ml). The serum
IL-6 concentration was negatively correlated with the serum MIF concentration (r¼ À0.283). No rela-
tionship was found between the serum MIF concentration and glucocorticoid dose. The MIF concen-
tration peaked twice during treatment when the creatine kinase concentration was decreasing.
Conclusion: MIF and IL-6 play important roles in the inflammation associated with polymyositis.
MIF might also be involved in the early stage of regeneration in polymyositis. MIF may thus serve
as a biomarker of disease activity and outcome.

muscle weakness and often has internal
organ involvement. The main pathophysio-
logical mechanism of PM is infiltration of
CD8þ T cells and macrophages into muscle
fibers, leading to lysis of the muscle fibers.1
In clinical practice, we still depend on the
physician's clinical assessment, mainly
including manual muscle strength testing
and measurement of serum muscle enzyme
levels, to evaluate the disease activity and
prognosis. The serum levels of many inflam-
matory factors are reportedly increased in
patients with inflammatory myopathies,2,3
and IL-6 may be a biomarker of disease
activity or outcome. Macrophage migration
inhibitory factor (MIF) is a potent and
pleiotropic cytokine that is secreted by acti-
vated T cells and macrophages and plays a
critical role in inflammatory and autoim-
mune diseases. It has anti-apoptotic, pro-
proliferative and pro-inflammatory effects
and may act as a modulator in cytokine
responses.4 MIF plays important roles in
many inflammatory diseases. Interestingly,
MIF can induce the cytokines IL-6 and
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), which
are known as the most useful biomarkers
in patients with PM.3 MIF inhibitor can
significantly decrease IL-6 and TNF-a pro-
duction.5 Moreover, MIF is a modulator of
glucocorticoid sensitivity and may thus
improve the status of high-dose glucocorti-
coid therapy in patients with PM. The con-
centrations of MIF in skeletal muscle are
reportedly higher in patients with inflam-
matory myopathies.6 However, the signifi-
cance of the serum MIF level in patients
with PM is still unknown. In this study,
we explored clinical significance of the
serum MIF level in patients with PM.
Materials and methods
Patients
In total, 36 inpatients with PM were
enrolled in Zhejiang Provincial People's
Hospital from August 2010 to December
2014. Patients with PM satisfied the criteria
proposed in 1975 by Bohan and Peter7,8 as
well as the consensus guidelines for PM in
China. We excluded patients with sporadic
inclusion body myositis, muscular dystro-
phy, and other myopathies. All patients
underwent muscle magnetic resonance
imaging. Patients with overlapping syn-
dromes were excluded. According to the
established disease activity tools described
by the International Myositis Assessment
and Clinical Studies Group, we used the
measures of global activity, muscle
strength, physical function, and laboratory
assessment. Twenty-five patients had
an active disease status and 12 patients
were in remission when serum samples
were obtained (two serum samples from
one patient were obtained: one during
active disease and one during remission).
Detailed clinical and laboratory data were
collected. Patients with active disease were
initially administered 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg/d of
glucocorticoids, and the glucocorticoids
were gradually tapered according to the
clinical assessment. Two patients were fol-
lowed during treatment, and their serum
samples were obtained when related labora-
tory data were checked every week. Serum
samples were voluntarily obtained from
10 healthy age- and sex-matched controls.
All serum samples were stored at À80C
prior to analysis. The study was approved
by the local ethics committee, and informed
consent was obtained from patients
and controls.
Methods
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for
MIF. The serum MIF concentration was
detected by a commercially available
ELISA kit (Quantikine ELISA for human
MIF; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
USA). According to the protocol, all of
the reagents, working standards, and
Zou et al. 733
serum samples were prepared before detec-
tion. A total of 100 ml of Assay Diluent
RD1-53 was added to each well of a 96-
well microplate, and 50 ml of standard, con-
trol, or serum samples was then added to
each well. The microplate was incubated for
2 hours at room temperature on a horizon-
tal orbital microplate shaker. The micro-
plate was then washed four times with
wash buffer. MIF conjugate (200 ml) was
added to each well of the microplate,
which was incubated for another 2 hours.
Another four washes were repeated. Next,
200 ml of substrate solution was added to
each well, and the microplate was incubated
for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Finally, 50 ml of stop solution was added
to each well, and the optical density was
determined within 30 minutes using a
microplate reader set to 450 nm.
ELISA for IL-6. The serum IL-6 concentration
was detected by a commercially available
ELISA kit (Quantikine ELISA for human
IL-6; R&D Systems). According to the pro-
tocol, all of the reagents, working stand-
ards, and serum samples were prepared
before detection. A total of 100 ml of
Assay Diluent RD1W was added to each
well of a 96-well microplate, and 100 ml of
standard, control, or serum samples was
then added to each well. The microplate
was incubated for 2 hours at room temper-
ature on a horizontal orbital microplate
shaker. After washing four times with
wash buffer, 200 ml of IL-6 conjugate was
added to each well of the microplate, and
incubation was performed for another 2
hours. The microplate was washed another
four times. A total of 200 ml of substrate
solution was added to each well, and the
microplate was incubated for 20 minutes
at room temperature. Finally, 50 ml of stop
solution was added to each well, and the
optical density was determined within 30
minutes using a microplate reader set to
450 nm.
Statistical analysis
The serum MIF concentration is expressed
as the mean Æ standard deviation.
Statistical differences between two groups
were evaluated by an independent-samples
t test. Spearman's correlation test was used
to evaluate the relationship of the MIF
concentration and laboratory data or glu-
cocorticoid dose. A p value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significant. All data
were analyzed with the statistical software
package SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA).
Results
In total, 36 patients with PM were enrolled,
comprising 29 women and 7 men with a
mean (Æstandard deviation) age of 56.13
(Æ11.10) years. The mean serum MIF con-
centration in 25 patents with active PM was
50.04 Æ 23.84 ng/ml. The mean concentra-
tion in the 12 patients in remission was
34.74 Æ 17.75 ng/ml, which was significantly
lower than that in the patients with active
disease (p ¼ 0.037). The mean serum MIF
concentration in the healthy controls was
38.87 Æ 9.30 ng/ml, which was significantly
lower than that in patients with active PM
(p ¼ 0.045). However, there was no signifi-
cant difference between the healthy controls
and patients in remission (Figure 1).
The mean serum IL-6 concentration was
19.67 Æ 7.16 pg/ml in the patients with
active PM and 15.81 Æ 4.00 pg/ml in patients
in remission. These concentrations were sig-
nificantly higher than those in controls (8.14
Æ 3.71 pg/ml, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the
mean IL-6 concentration in patients with
active PM was significantly higher than
that in patients in remission (p ¼ 0.043).
The serum MIF concentration was
negatively correlated with the serum IL-6
concentration (r¼ À0.283, p ¼ 0.046)
(Figure 2). When the serum samples were
obtained, no significant difference in the

serum MIF concentration was found
between patients with active PM who were
and were not receiving glucocorticoid thera-
py. Additionally, no relationship was found
between the serum MIF concentration and
glucocorticoid dose. Other parameters, such
as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and
serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate
dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, ala-
nine transaminase, and C-reactive protein,
showed no significant correlation with the
serum MIF concentration.
Two patients were followed up during
treatment. Both patients were newly diag-
nosed and given 1 mg/kg/d of a glucocorticoid
for treatment. Patient 1 had muscle weakness
for 1 month when the treatment began, while
Patient 2 had muscle weakness for 6 months.
In Patient 1, serum samples began to be
obtained after nearly 1 month of treatment.
In Patient 2, the first serum sample was
obtained before treatment. We observed two
peaks in the serum MIF concentration during
treatment when the CK levels were descend-
ing, and the levels decreased when the CK
levels normalized (Figures 3 and 4).
Discussion
MIF acts as both a potent cytokine and a
hormone-like molecule. Many researchers
have found that MIF can induce TNF-a
in monocytes, IL-6 and IL-12 in peritoneal
macrophages, and IL-6 and IL-8 in synovial
fibroblasts.9­12 However, Kudrin et al.13
found no induction of TNF-a, IL-6, or
IL-12 release by synovial fibroblasts or
macrophages using very highly purified
MIF. MIF can be produced by many cell
types, mainly by activated T cells and

involved in the processes of autophagy
and autophagic cell death.15 The pathogen-
esis of PM involves cytotoxic CD8þ T cells
attacking skeletal muscle fibers followed by
invasion of non-necrotic fibers by these T
cells and macrophages.1 Additionally, mac-

regeneration of inflammatory disorders of
skeletal muscle, while the random migra-
tion of macrophages can be inhibited by
MIF. Few studies have focused on MIF in
relation to skeletal muscle. In the present
study, we found that the MIF concentra-
tion was higher in patients with active
PM. However, there were no significant dif-
ferences between patients in remission and
healthy controls. Reimann et al.6 also found
that the MIF concentrations in protein
lysates were higher than in controls. This
may suggest that MIF plays a role in
patients with active PM.
The serum IL-6 level may be a sensitive
biomarker of disease activity in dermato-
myositis16,17 and is reportedly an important
proinflammatory cytokine in the inflamma-
tory process of PM. Therefore, we evaluat-
ed the serum IL-6 concentration in the
present study. Although IL-6 and MIF are
both inflammatory factors, we unexpectedly
observed that the serum IL-6 concentration
was negatively correlated with the serum
MIF concentration in patients with PM.
A previous study showed that MIF was
detected not only in inflammatory cells
but also in muscle fiber membranes, sug-
gesting that MIF is also involved in the
response to muscle fiber damage.6
Whether a balance in MIF exists between
inflammation and regeneration in patients
with PM requires further research. In an
in vitro experiment, glucocorticoids affect-
ed MIF production in a bimodal way: low
concentrations of glucocorticoids induced
MIF production, and high concentrations
of glucocorticoids inhibited MIF produc-
tion.9 Another in vivo study showed that
MIF could be up-regulated by endogenous
glucocorticoids in rats with adjuvant-
induced arthritis.18 In humans, the serum
MIF concentration is influenced by exoge-
nous glucocorticoids even after adjusting
for disease activity variables.19 We found
no significant differences in the serum
MIF concentration between patients with
active PM who were and were not receiving
glucocorticoid therapy as well as no rela-
tionship between the serum MIF concentra-
tion and glucocorticoid dose. Exogenous
glucocorticoids are not the main factor
impacting the MIF concentration in
patients with active PM. Consequently,
unlike IL-6 as a proinflammatory factor,
MIF may play another role in PM.
We also followed up two patients during
their treatment. In these patients, glucocor-
ticoids were given at 1 mg/kg/d, and
the dose was not changed until the CK
level had normalized to exclude the effects
of the glucocorticoids. While the CK level
was descending, we observed two peaks
in the MIF concentration. MIF, which
has anti-apoptotic, pro-proliferative, and
macrophage-attracting functions,4 may
have another effect in the regeneration
after muscle injury. MIF was detected at
muscle fiber membranes, at the borders of
infiltrates, or in necrotic fibers in the skele-
tal muscle of patients with PM. Focal sar-
coplasmic reactivity was also observed,
especially in fibers showing sarcolemmal
MIF immunoreactivity.6 The MIF concen-
tration decreased when the CK level nor-
malized. These data suggest that MIF
plays a role not only in the inflammatory
process of PM but also in the early stage
of the regeneration response. Further stud-
ies involving more patients should be per-
formed to confirm this result.
In conclusion, MIF and IL-6 play impor-
tant roles in the inflammation associated
with PM. MIF acts as a potent and pleio-
tropic cytokine and may also be involved in
the early stage of regeneration in PM. MIF
may be a biomarker of disease activity and
outcome.
