Are Emergency Departments Appropriately Treating
Adolescent Pelvic Inflammatory Disease?
Of the almost 1 million annually diagnosed cases of pelvic in-
flammatory disease (PID), 20% occur among adolescents.1 Be-
cause reproductive health concerns are the most common rea-
sons for emergency department (ED) visits among adolescent
girls, it is critical that ED providers are knowledgeable about
the diagnosis and treatment of PID. The objective of this study
was to evaluate adherence to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) PID treatment guidelines among a na-
tionally representative sample of adolescent ED PID visits.
Methods | This study was considered exempt from formal re-
view by our institutional review board. We conducted a retro-
spective cross-sectional analysis of the National Hospital Am-
bulatory Medical Care Survey from 2000 to 2009. The National
Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey is an annual, na-
tional probability sample survey of hospital EDs conducted by
theNationalCenterforHealthStatisticsbranchoftheCDC.2 The
eligible study population included all sampled ED visits by fe-
males between ages 14 and 21 years during 2000 to 2009 with
the diagnosis of PID captured by International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Our outcome measure was ad-
herence to CDC recommended PID treatment guidelines by
evaluating whether patients were prescribed antibiotics that
were considered first- or second-line treatment for PID for the
respective year based on the published CDC sexually transmit-
ted disease treatment guidelines for PID management.3 Given
thattheCDCtreatmentguidelineschangedin2006,wealsocal-
culatedtheaverageproportionofappropriatelytreatedPIDcases
before and after the 2006 CDC treatment guideline change. We
used descriptive statistics and logistic regression with appro-
priate weighting to account for the complex survey methods to
calculate all estimates and perform all analyses.
Results | During the study period, there were an estimated
704 882 (95% CI, 571 807-837 957) PID cases in EDs. Among
these, only 37.1% (95% CI, 30.6%-45.5%) were prescribed an-
tibiotics that adhered to the CDC recommended treatment
guidelines. Prior to 2006, only 30.7% (95% CI, 9.2%-52.3%) of
PID cases received appropriate antibiotic therapy. This in-
creased to 49.5% (95% CI, 22.9%-76.6%) after the guideline
change (P = .01). The most common antibiotic regimen found
among inappropriately treated patients was the combination
of ceftriaxone sodium and azithromycin (17.1%).
Discussion | To our knowledge, this analysis represents the first
population-based assessment of recent compliance with CDC
recommended treatment guidelines for adolescent ED pa-
tients diagnosed with PID. Only 37% of PID cases were treated
according to the CDC treatment guidelines in our study. Fur-
thermore, the common use of a third-generation cephalo-
sporin and azithromycin suggests that clinicians may errone-
ously believe that PID treatment is identical to cervicitis
treatment and/or that patients are incapable of adherence to
doxycycline. This finding has substantial implications be-
cause inadequate treatment of PID may lead to serious long-
term sequelae such as chronic pelvic pain or tubal infertility.
Additionally, the lack of adherence to the CDC guidelines sug-
gests a need to further study strategies for optimal diffusion
and acceptance of the CDC guidelines.
Our finding of low adherence to the CDC treatment guide-
lines is consistent with those of other single-center studies and
studies of adult populations.4-6 However, to our knowledge,
our study is the first to evaluate whether treatment adher-
ence had changed since the dissemination of the CDC 2006
sexually transmitted disease treatment guidelines. Even with
the sizeable increase in the percentage of patients who were
treated appropriately from prior to 2006 to afterward, more
than 50% of patients are still not receiving treatment consis-
tent with national guidelines. Furthermore, these nationally
representative data demonstrate the need and potential high
impact of using the ED as a strategic setting to further under-
stand these issues and change clinical practice.

Preordering School Lunch Encourages
Better Food Choices by Children
Nearly one-third of children between ages 6 and 19 years are
considered obese1 and their choosing of less healthy foods in
school lunchrooms may contribute.2 To encourage students to
select healthier foods, recent research has focused on how en-
vironmentalchangesandbehavioraleconomicscanguidechil-
dren to make healthier choices.3,4 This includes the preorder-
ing of lunch. Preordering could preempt hunger-based,
spontaneous selections and eliminate the sensory cues--
evocative smells and sights--that lead to less healthy choices.
We examine whether having students preorder their entrée
(main dish) improves the healthfulness of entrées selected for
lunch.
Methods | The Cornell University institutional review board ap-
proved this study and waived written consent, yet teachers,
staff, school administrators, and parents were notified. In 2 el-
ementary schools in upstate New York, students use an elec-
tronic system to preorder their lunch entrée. The schools are
located in a predominantly white (96.6%) county where 55%
of students receive free or reduced-price lunches. Over a
4-week period (November 14-December 9, 2011), 14 class-
rooms (grades 1-5) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 condi-
tions. In weeks 1 and 2, all classrooms preordered as usual. In
week 3, 4 classrooms discontinued preordering but resumed
preordering in week 4. (Because this could lead to contami-
nation of behavior in week 4, we omit these observations.) In
week 4, 5 classrooms discontinued preordering. Five class-
rooms never stopped preordering.
Sales records, including school, grade, classroom, stu-
dent identifiers, and daily entrée choice, were collected for 272
students. Entrées with the greatest nutrient density on any
given day were coded as healthy while others were coded as
unhealthy. Data were analyzed with Stata 12 (StataCorp) using
a mixed-effects logistic model with students nested within
classroom.
Results | When students preordered their entrée, 29.4% se-
lected the healthier entrée compared with 15.3% when preor-
dering was not available (Table). Conversely, the less healthy
entrée was chosen 70.8% of the time by students who preor-
dered, and students who ordered in the lunch line selected the
less healthy entrée 85.7% of the time (Table). When students
did not order but instead selected their entrée as they en-
tered the lunch line, it appears that hunger-based, spontane-
ous selection diminished healthy entrée selection by 48% and
increased less healthy entrée selection by 21% (Table).
Consumption data (not reported), which were collected in
the cafeterias via a visual estimation technique, support this
robust result and suggest preordering the entrée also affects
selection and consumption of side items. Together, both con-
sumption and selection data demonstrate how a simple envi-
ronmental change--preordering--can prompt children to
choose healthier food.
Discussion | In a school setting, preordering can effectively lead
students to pick healthier entrées. Students who selected their
entrée in the lunch line, where decisions are biased by aro-
mas and sights of tasty, less healthy foods, decreased selec-
tion of healthy entrées by 48% and increased selection of less
healthy entrées by 21%. Though this research did not change
the layout of the lunch line, students precommitted to a lunch
entrée outside of the cafeteria, effectively modifying the de-
cision environment. A smarter lunchroom is not confined to
the space within the cafeteria walls.
Whereas this research used a computerized preordering
system, paper-based systems are easy, inexpensive, and an im-
mediately implementable alternative. The ease of implement-
ing these systems can allow future research to examine the ef-
fectiveness of these systems on the selection of entrées, side
