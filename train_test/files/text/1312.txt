Objectives: The objectives of this study were to estimate national
seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), describe trends
in seroprevalence, and examine correlates of infection.
Goal: The goal of this study was to measure the burden of HSV-1
infection in the U.S. population.
Study: We tested serum samples for HSV-1 antibody and analyzed
questionnaire data collected for the second and third National Health
and Nutrition Surveys (NHANES II, 1976­80; NHANES III, 1988--
94). Seroprevalence estimates were weighted to represent the total U.S.
population.
Results: At the time of NHANES III, two thirds (68%) of the U.S.
population 12 years and older had HSV-1 antibody. Prevalence in-
creased with age and varied by race/ethnicity; the majority of persons
in all race/ethnic groups were HSV-1-seropositive by age 30. Overall,
the national seroprevalence of HSV-1 decreased nonsignificantly by
2% in the years between NHANES II and III; decreases in HSV-1
seroprevalence in some population subgroups were balanced by in-
creases in other groups.
Conclusions: There was no overall change in the seroprevalence of
HSV-1 in the U.S. population between NHANES II and III.
HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS TYPE 1 (HSV-1) infections are com-
mon worldwide.1 Most infections are asymptomatic, or manifest as
primary gingivostomatitis or recurrent orolabial facial lesions;
however, HSV-1 also causes severe infections of the eyes and
central nervous system, and disseminated infection, especially
among immunocompromised persons.2­4 In the United States and
some other countries, HSV-1 infections account for a substantial
and increasing proportion of genital herpes infections.5­13 Genital
infections caused by HSV-1 are clinically indistinguishable from
those caused by the closely related herpes simplex virus type 2
(HSV-2).14 However, because reactivation is more common with
HSV-2 than HSV-1 genital disease,15,16 HSV-2 is more likely to be
the cause of genital herpes recurrences. Perinatal transmission of
genital HSV-1 or HSV-2 can result in neonatal herpes infections
with a similar spectrum of disease, and with high rates of morbid-
ity and mortality despite antiviral treatment.17­20 Recent reports
that HSV-1 may be an etiologic agent or serve as a cofactor for
certain chronic neurologic and cardiovascular diseases21,22 suggest
that the scope of disease attributable to HSV-1 may be broader
than has been previously appreciated.
HSV-1 infection is transmitted by contact with virus-containing
secretions. Most infections are sporadic; however, outbreaks have
occurred in settings where large numbers of susceptible children
are congregated.4 Age, nonwhite race, female sex, lower educa-
tional attainment, and lower socioeconomic status have been con-
sistently associated with HSV-1 seropositivity23­28; however, few
studies have used multivariate methodologies to control for pos-
sible confounding between these factors. Behavioral practices that
may increase risk for HSV-1 acquisition have been even less
clearly delineated. Although measures of sexual activity (such as
lifetime number of sex partners) have been examined in numerous
studies,24­26,28­30 few have found significant associations with
HSV-1 seropositivity,26,31,32 perhaps because other intimate be-
haviors that can transmit HSV-1 (kissing, orogenital contact),
often precede sexual intercourse. Behavioral and childrearing prac-
tices associated with childhood infection (such as an infant sharing
a bed with parents) have rarely been investigated and described.23
There are conflicting data concerning whether prior HSV-1
infection protects against acquisition of HSV-2 infection31,33­35;
however, preexisting HSV-1 antibody appears to increase the
likelihood that a subsequent HSV-2 infection will be subclini-
cal31,35,36 and may affect HSV-2 vaccine efficacy.37 Although
declines in HSV-1 seroprevalence have been reported for some
populations,1,28 national trends in HSV-1 seroprevalence have not
been examined in the United States. We examined data from the
second and third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
veys (NHANES II and III), conducted in 1976­1980 (NHANES
II) and 1988­1994 (NHANES III). During the interval between the
2 surveys, the national seroprevalence of HSV-2 increased by
30%.38 We analyzed data from NHANES III to obtain recent
measures of the national seroprevalence of HSV-1 and to examine
factors associated with seropositivity. We also compared the se-

roprevalence in NHANES II and III to measure trends in HSV-1
seroprevalence.
Materials and Methods
Study Population and Sample Design
The NHANES are a series of cross-sectional national surveys of
health and nutritional status conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics of the United States Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. The NHANES use a complex, stratified, multi-
stage, probability-cluster design for sampling a population repre-
sentative of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the
United States. Details of the survey methodology and data collec-
tion have been published previously.39,40 In brief, survey partici-
pants were asked about family and individual demographics, and a
medical history was conducted during a household interview.
Sensitive questions related to sexual behavior and illicit drug use
were asked during a private interview at a mobile examination
center, where participants underwent physical examination and
specimen collection for laboratory testing.
NHANES II was conducted between 1976 and 1980, and over-
sampled preschool children, older people, and people living below
the poverty level. A total of 27,801 persons 6 months to 74 years
of age were sampled. Of these, 25,286 were interviewed and
20,322 examined, for an overall examination response rate of 73%.
Serologic testing for HSV-1 was not included in the original
design of NHANES II; sera were not available from all examined
study participants for reasons that included unsuccessful venipunc-
ture and use of serum for other tests. There were 13,488 persons
aged 15 to 74 years of age examined, and serum specimens were
available for 9943 of these participants. The original number of
serum specimens available for persons aged 12 to 14 years was not
documented.41 An unequal probability sample of the available sera
from persons 12 years and older was selected (n  3597) for
HSV-1 serologic testing. The sample included all the nonwhites
and a random sample of 20% to 25% of the whites in each age
group. Weighted seroprevalence estimates were calculated by mul-
tiplying the original NHANES II examination weight by a second
weight that reflected the subsampling procedure and poststratifi-
cation by age, race, and sex.
NHANES III was conducted in 1988­1994, and oversampled
children under 5 years of age, persons 60 years and older, Mexican
Americans, and black Americans; there was no upper age limit for
survey participants. A total of 39,695 persons were sampled for
NHANES III; of these, 33,994 were interviewed and 30,818 were
examined for an overall examination response rate of 78%. Sera
were collected from 29,314 (95%) of persons examined. HSV-1
antibody results were available on 79.2% (13,098 of 16,531) of
examined persons aged 12 and older, including 12,221 persons
aged 12 to 74.
Race/ethnicity was defined differently for the 2 surveys. In
NHANES II, race was defined by self-report as "white," "black,"
and "other," and self-reported ancestry was used to ascribe eth-
nicity. To permit comparisons between the 2 surveys, NHANES II
participants who reported Hispanic ancestry were excluded from
the black and white race categories and included in the total
population along with respondents of other races to create non-
Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white analytic categories. In
NHANES III, race and ethnicity were ascertained separately, and
analytically recoded into race/ethnicity categories of "non-His-
panic black" (NH-black), "non-Hispanic white" (NH-white),
"Mexican American," and "other." The poverty index ratio was
calculated by dividing the total reported family income by the
poverty threshold (adjusted for family size).42 Residence was
classified as urban if the county of residence was in a metropolitan
area with a population of 1 million or more. Household crowding
was calculated by dividing household size by the number of rooms
in the home not including the bathroom. A crowding index of 1.0
indicates 1 person per room.
During the interview portion of the NHANES III, questions
related to daycare, sexual activity, and illicit drug use were asked
only of specific age groups. Prior daycare attendance was ascer-
tained only for survey participants aged 12 to 16 (or their guard-
ian). Adolescents aged 15 and 16 were asked only if they had ever
had intercourse and age at first intercourse, whereas persons aged
17 to 59 were asked whether they had ever had intercourse, age at
first intercourse, lifetime number of sex partners, and whether they
had a history of genital herpes. Questions concerning marijuana
and cocaine use were addressed to participants between the ages of
12 and 59.
Serologic Testing
Serum samples were tested for antibody to HSV-1 and HSV-2
by immunodot tests using purified glycoprotein gG-1 of HSV-1
and gG-2 of HSV-2, respectively, as the antigens for the assay. All
specimens were tested in the same laboratory using the same assay.
The type-specific immunodot assays used for this study can dif-
ferentiate between antibody to HSV-1 and HSV-2 and have high
sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.43­45 Assay perfor-
mance was monitored throughout the testing period by testing
positive and negative controls derived from reference sera.
Statistical Analyses
Seroprevalence Estimates. Seroprevalence estimates for
NHANES II and III were weighted to represent the total U.S. popu-
lation at the time of each survey. Seropositivity rates for NHANES II
were calculated using available sera from 12 to 74 year olds; for
NHANES III, seropositivity was calculated using sera from partici-
pants 12 and older. The weighting procedure accounted for oversam-
pling and nonresponse to the household and physical examination
portions of the survey. Adjustments were also made for estimates of
age, sex, and race/ethnicity of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population
taken from the Current Population Survey adjusted for undercount-
ing.46,47 For both surveys, seroprevalence was calculated for sub-
groups defined by sex and race/ethnicity and for standard age groups.
Because NHANES II had an upper age limit of 74, the oldest age
group for which seroprevalence could be estimated for that survey
was 70 to 74 year olds; for NHANES III, the oldest age group for
which seroprevalence was estimated includes persons older than 74.
Estimates of prevalence, standard errors, and all analyses were per-
formed using SUDAAN software (release 7.5.2; Research Triangle
Institute).
Trends. To permit comparisons between NHANES II and III,
data were age-adjusted by direct standardization to the 1980 U.S.
population. Differences between NHANES II and NHANES III
prevalence estimates were considered to be statistically significant
if the 95% confidence intervals surrounding the prevalence esti-
mate did not overlap. Because the upper and lower age limits
differed for the 2 survey samples, comparisons between NHANES
II and III are limited to persons aged 12 to 74 (NHANES II, n 
3597; NHANES III, n  12,221). Although persons of all race/
ethnicities are included in the overall, national estimates of sero-
prevalence, changes in seroprevalence could be assessed for NH-
blacks and NH-whites, but not for Hispanic or Mexican Americans
because ethnicity was defined and sampled differently for the 2
surveys, and not for persons in the "other" category.

Bivariate and Multivariate Analyses. Bivariate analyses were
performed to examine risk factors for infection at the time of the
most recent national survey, NHANES III (1988­1994). Because
variables of interest (regarding daycare attendance, sexual activity,
and illicit drug use) were ascertained only among persons aged 12
to 59, our analyses were limited to that age range. Variables were
examined if they described a characteristic with a plausible rela-
tionship to the acquisition of HSV-1, or if significant associations
with HSV-1 or HSV-2 had been previously reported. Because
correlates of HSV-1 infection could differ between adolescents
and adults, analyses were performed separately for adolescents
(ages 12­16) and adults (ages 17­59). Variables that were signif-
icantly associated with HSV-1 seropositivity in either of the age
group-specific bivariate analyses were included in both multivar-
iate models. The models were adjusted for age and the square of
age as continuous variables. Participants whose race/ethnicity cat-
egory was classified as "other" were excluded from analyses
because there were too few to achieve stable measures of associ-
ation.
Results
Seroprevalence
NHANES III (1988­1994). At the time of the most recent
national survey, two thirds (67.7%) of the U.S. population aged 12
and older had antibody to HSV-1. The seroprevalence was signif-
icantly higher among females (70.9%) than males (64.2%). Sero-
prevalence increased with age and varied significantly by race/
ethnicity (Table 1).
The overall seroprevalence of HSV-1 was significantly higher
among Mexican Americans (85.1%) and NH-blacks (74.1%) than
among NH-whites (64.7%). Although sex differences were not
significant, females had a slightly higher prevalence than males in
each of the 3 defined race/ethnicity groups (Mexican American
females 86.1% vs. Mexican American males 84.2%; NH-black
females 76.0% vs. NH-black males 71.7%; NH-white females
68.0% vs. NH-white males 61.2%). By age 12 to 19, the youngest
age group for which we had data, the seroprevalence among
Mexican Americans (69.4%) and NH-blacks (55.9%) was already
1.9 and 1.5 times higher, respectively, than that among NH-whites
(36.5%). Seroprevalence plateaued among NH-blacks and Mexi-
can Americans after age 39, whereas among NH-whites, the sero-
prevalence continued to increase. Among persons 70 years and
older, 99.0% of Mexican Americans, 86.5% of NH-blacks, and
90.0% of NH-whites had antibody to HSV-1.
Trends in Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Seropositivity Between
NHANES II and NHANES III
Overall, there was no significant change in HSV-1 seropreva-
lence among 12 to 74 year olds between NHANES II (66.4%) and
NHANES III (65.1%) (Table 2). Seroprevalence was 68% among
females during both surveys; among males, the seroprevalence was
64.5% during NHANES II and 62.1% during NHANES III. There
was a 6% decrease among NH-whites (10% among males and 3%
among females) and a 7% decrease among NH-blacks (6% among
males and 8% among females); however, neither of these de-
creases was statistically significant. The prevalence of infection
between the 2 surveys increased among persons in the other
race/ethnicity category; however, the composition of this category
differed in NHANES II (77% Hispanic white, 0.1% Hispanic
black, 20% Asian or Pacific Islander, and 2.9% other) and
NHANES III (35% Hispanic white, 25% Hispanic black, 29%
Asian or Pacific Islander, and 11% other).

NATIONAL SEROPREVALENCE AND TRENDS IN HSV-1
Several interesting trends were apparent when sex- and age-
specific seroprevalence estimates were compared for NH-blacks
and NH-whites (Fig. 1A, B). Between 1976­1980 and 1988­1994,
HSV-1 seroprevalence decreased among NH-black and NH-white
males and NH-black females in younger age groups (ages 12­19
and 20­29). Seroprevalence decreased significantly for 50- to 59-
year-old NH-white females; however, minimal or no changes
in seroprevalence were observed for NH-white females in the 12 to
19, 20 to 29, and 30 to 39-year-old age groups.
Bivariate and Multivariate Analyses
Among adolescents, HSV-1 seroprevalence was higher among
study participants who were of race/ethnicities other than NH-
white, nonurban dwellers, living in poverty, or in crowded house-
holds (more than 1 person per room). The prevalence was lower
among adolescents who had ever attended daycare (34.6% vs.
46.4% among nonattenders) and higher among those who were
foreign-born (61.5% vs. 39.8% among nonforeign-born). Of note,
23% of 12- to 16-year-old Mexican Americans were foreign born,
compared with 3% of NH-black and 2% of NH-white Americans,
whereas more than half (58%) of persons classified as belonging to
"other racial/ethnic groups" were foreign-born. HSV-1 seropreva-
lence was 88.9% among adolescents who were HSV-2 antibody-
positive, compared with 39.5% among those who were HSV-2-
seronegative.
Among adults, HSV-1 seropositivity was significantly associated
with all of the demographic, behavioral, and clinical variables exam-
ined. Young age at first intercourse (less than age 16) was associated
with seropositivity, and persons with 1 lifetime sex partner were more
likely to be seropositive (65.2%) than persons who had not had
intercourse (41.2%); however, seroprevalence did not increase with
increasing numbers of sex partners (2­9 partners, 65.8%; 10 or more
partners, 66.9%). Seroprevalence was lower among persons with
higher levels of educational attainment and among those who con-
sumed more than 1 alcoholic drink per month, smoked tobacco, or
smoked marijuana. As was the case with adolescents, foreign-born
status was associated with a higher prevalence of HSV-1 antibody.
Among persons 17 years and older, 53% of Mexican Americans were
foreign-born, compared with 7% of NH-black and 5% of NH-white
Americans; the majority (79%) of persons classified as belonging to
"other racial/ethnic groups" were foreign-born.
Multivariate Analyses
For both adolescents and adults, the multivariate models con-
tained the following variables: age, square of age, sex, race/
ethnicity, urban residence, poverty, household crowding, foreign-

Because there was an upper age limit for the NHANES II (age 74), and a lower age limit for NHANES III (age 12), comparisons between
NHANES II and III could only be made for persons between the ages of 12 and 74 (n  3597 for NHANES II).

was added to the model for adolescents; educational attainment,
marital status, and age at first intercourse ("sexual debut") were
included in the adult model only.
Age and square of age were significant predictors of HSV-1
seropositivity in both adolescents and adults. For adolescents,
race/ethnicity other than NH-white, nonurban residence, poverty,
household crowding, and HSV-2 seropositivity remained signifi-
cantly associated with HSV-1 seropositivity, even after adjusting
for all other variables in the model; daycare attendance remained
significant and had a protective effect (Table 3).
In the adult model, the following variables remained signifi-
cantly associated with HSV-1: female sex, race/ethnicity other
than NH-white, nonurban residence, foreign-born status, and
smoking history (Table 3). Race/ethnicity and foreign-born status
had the strongest positive associations with HSV-1 seropositivity.
History of marijuana use, education, and age 16 or older at first
sexual intercourse had a protective effect
Discussion
At the time of the third NHANES (1988­1994), more than two
thirds of the U.S. population aged 12 and older had HSV-1
antibody, making HSV-1 one of the most common, lifelong viral
infections recognized to affect the U.S. population. Although the
seroprevalence differed by sex and between the race/ethnicity
groups examined, a high overall prevalence and strong positive
association with age was observed in both sexes, and in all race/
ethnicity groups, a finding which has been observed in populations
and birth cohorts throughout the world.1,27,28,48,49 The pattern of
age-specific seropositivity observed for NH-blacks and Mexican

NATIONAL SEROPREVALENCE AND TRENDS IN HSV-1
Americans in the NHANES III survey suggests that in these
groups, most HSV-1 acquisition occurs during childhood or young
adulthood. In contrast, the increasing age-specific prevalence
among NH-whites suggests either a cohort effect or continued
acquisition of HSV-1 in older age groups. Because a large pro-
portion of NH-whites enter adulthood and middle age seronega-
tive, they may continue to acquire HSV-1. Adults may acquire
HSV-1 infection by means that differ from, or are in addition to,
those among children, and such exposures may be more common
among NH-white adults than among adults in other race/ethnicity
groups. Such exposures could include childrearing practices
(which may bring adults into contact with children's secretions),
personal behaviors (such as smoking), and sexual practices.50,51
Overall, the national seroprevalence was unchanged between the

2 surveys. Although HSV-1 seropositivity decreased among both
NH-black and NH-white Americans between 1976­1980 and
1988­1994, the overall seroprevalence remained stable because
these decreases were effectively balanced by increases in sero-
prevalence among the other race/ethnicity groups comprising the
U.S. population at the time of the 2 surveys. Because the majority
of persons classified as belonging to "other" race/ethnicity groups
in the NHANES III sample were born outside the United States,
the increase in seroprevalence among persons in the "other" race/
ethnicity groups may represent in-migration from countries of
higher HSV-1 seroprevalence. It is difficult to interpret changes in
age-specific seroprevalence across surveys; when comparing the
seroprevalence among persons of the same age group from
NHANES II and NHANES III, observed differences in seropreva-
lence may reflect actual increases or decreases in transmission,
cohort effects, or some combination of both of these factors.
We examined risk factors for infection separately among ado-
lescents and adults because we hypothesized that transmission
could occur by predominantly different routes at different ages.
Our multivariate analysis among 12 to 16 year olds suggests that
age, race/ethnicity other than NH-white, nonurban residence, pov-
erty, and household crowding were independently associated with
HSV-1 seropositivity. The strong association between HSV-1 and
HSV-2 seropositivity in adolescents suggests that sexual behaviors
may play an important role in acquisition among adolescents.
However, because adolescents were not asked certain questions
regarding sexual behavior, we were limited in our ability to ex-
amine the importance of sexual behavior as a risk factor for HSV-1
infection and were unable to compare the relative importance of
sexual practices for adolescents compared with adults.
We identified multiple risk factors for HSV-1 seropositivity
among adults, including older age, female sex, and race/ethnicity
other than NH-white. These findings are similar to those of 2
previous studies.24,26 Childrearing responsibilities and differences
in sexual exposure between men and women may explain the
higher risk of HSV-1 among women. For adults, the association
we found between being born outside the United States ("foreign-
born") and HSV-1 infection is consistent with previous findings24
and may be explained by the fact that the majority of foreign-born
survey participants originate from countries with a high prevalence
of HSV-1 infection. The importance of foreign-born status among
adults, but not adolescents, may reflect the longer time that adults
may have spent in high-prevalence areas. Both smoking and mar-
ijuana use were independently associated with HSV-1 seropositiv-
ity in our survey, although it is difficult to postulate why one of
these behaviors (smoking tobacco) would increase risk and the
other (smoking marijuana) reduce risk. The protective effect of
older age at sexual debut suggests that, as with adolescents, sexual
behavior may have a role in HSV-1 acquisition among adults.
Poverty was a significant predictor of infection among adolescents
but was not predictive among adults in our survey. A single
measure of socioeconomic status in adults probably has poor
correlation with lifetime risk for infection, because the majority of
HSV-1 transmission occurs among children, adolescents, and
young adults.
Genital HSV-1 infection cannot be distinguished from oral infec-
tion using the serologic data available from the NHANES surveys.
However, increases in the proportion of genital isolates typed as
HSV-1 and recent studies identifying female sex and receptive oral
sex as risk factors for culture-confirmed HSV-1 genital infection52
suggest that an increasing proportion of HSV-1-seropositive females
acquire genital rather than an oral infection. In the AIDS era, with
widespread messages about the importance of safe sex, and docu-
mented declines in the number of adolescents engaging in sexual
intercourse,53,54 it is possible that intimate behaviors such as oral sex
have replaced insertive intercourse in certain age groups, leading to an
increased risk for orogenital transmission of HSV-1. Because there
are few data available to describe trends in the practice of oral sex,55
this can only be hypothesized. Although HSV-1 is less likely to recur
than HSV-2, the likelihood of genital-to-genital transmission of
HSV-1 may increase with increases in the proportion of genital
infections caused by HSV-1. In our analysis, NH-whites were approx-
imately half as likely as NH-blacks to have HSV-1 antibodies by the
age of sexual debut, making them more susceptible to primary genital
HSV-1 infection.
Strategies are needed to prevent genital herpes, whether caused by
HSV-1 or HSV-2. It is well known that genital ulcer disease increases
the risk for acquisition and transmission of human immunodeficiency
virus56 and that genital herpes infection contributes substantially to the
burden of genital ulcer diseases worldwide.57­59 It will be important to
continue to monitor the prevalence of HSV-1 in the future, because
changes in HSV-1 prevalence and age at acquisition may be expected
to alter the relative proportion of genital infections resulting from
HSV-1 and HSV-2, the possible impact of candidate HSV-2 vaccines,
the probability of symptomatic genital infection, and the risk for
infection resulting in neonatal herpes or severe disseminated disease.
