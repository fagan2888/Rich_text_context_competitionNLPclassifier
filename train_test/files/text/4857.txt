Introduction
In September 2004, the Sullivan Commission on Diversity
in the Healthcare Workforce released its report, "Missing
persons: Minorities in the Health Professions." The report
concluded that "access to health professions remains
largely separate and unequal" (p. 4). The report further
argued that increasing the diversity of the health care
workforce is a necessary step toward the reduction of
health disparities that adversely affect racial and ethnic
communities in the United States. Various attempts to
increase the diversity of the U.S. health care workforce
were attempted. Included among these efforts were minor-
ity enrichment programs established in many universities
and medical schools to promote careers in health profes-
sions to students who are from underrepresented minority
(URM) groups or are economically disadvantaged.
However, the programs are now threatened by sharp
reductions in federal funding. Case studies of two minor-
ity enrichment programs examine how the program direc-
tors responded to the reductions in funding.
Background--Underrepresented
Racial and Ethnic Groups in the
Health Professions
According to the American Association of Medical Colleges,
racial and ethnic groups are considered as "underrepre-
sented" in a health profession if their proportional represen-
tation in that profession is less than their representation
within the general population (Association of American
Medical Colleges [AAMC], 2006). For example, 15% of the
U.S. populations were Hispanic (all races), 12% were non-
Hispanic African Americans, and 0.9% were non-Hispanic
Native Americans (U.S. Census, 2010). Yet, these groups

Abstract
Minority enrichment programs play a vitally important role in current efforts to increase the number of health care providers
from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations and other disadvantaged groups. However, the existence of minority
enrichment programs is challenged by recent changes in the political and economic environment,including the sharp reduction
of federal funding support in 2006.This article presents case studies of two longitudinal minority enrichment programs located
in Chicago, Illinois: the Urban Health Program (UHP) of the University of Illinois at Chicago, and the Chicago Area Health
and Medical Career Program (CAHMCP) at Illinois Institute of Technology. Prior to the cuts in federal funding, in 2005, we
conducted in-person interviews with administrative staff of the two programs.The qualitative data were supplemented with
follow-up interviews conducted in 2008 with directors of the programs.During the interviews,we discussed how the programs
responded to the budget cuts and how the programs viewed their future prospects.The results of the study indicated that
adequate funding is crucial for the continued success of these minority enrichment programs in ensuring a viable health
professions pipeline.

comprised approximately 2.8%, 3.3%, and 0.3% of U.S.
physicians, respectively (AAMC, 2006). Based on this defi-
nition, Asians as a whole are not considered underrepre-
sented in most health professions and are actually
overrepresented based on their proportion of the U.S. popu-
lation. However, some Asian subpopulations, such as
Cambodian and Samoan ethnicities, are considered under-
represented (Smedley, Stith, & Nelson, 2003).
Before 1960, racial and ethnic minorities comprised less
than 2% of new U.S. medical school enrollees (Cohen,
Gabriel, & Terrell, 2002). Since then, the representation of
minorities in medical school enrollments has risen apprecia-
bly. In the fall of 2007, 7.3% of new matriculates to U.S.
medical school programs were Hispanic (all races), and
6.8% were non-Hispanic African American (AAMC, 2007).
Despite the growing proportion of minority medical students
during the past 40 years, the representation in medical school
enrollment is still significantly below that of the U.S.
population.
Method and Analysis
This study uses a Hermeneutic Dialectic Process methodol-
ogy (Guba, 1990) to gather data in the qualitative part of this
research. The analysis of the data began with the construc-
tion of the interview guide. This process was continually
enhanced as the interviews progressed. The hermeneutic
aspect consisted of depicting individual constructions as
accurately as possible, while the dialectic aspect consisted of
comparing and contrasting these existing individual (includ-
ing the researcher's) constructions, so that each person inter-
viewed confronts and came to terms with the constructions
based on their own and other's perspectives (Guba, 1990).
The belief that each of us (the interviewer and those inter-
viewed) brought individual interpretations to the table was
the basis for the methodology of this study. This method
allowed for the interpretation of data in a collaborative and
communicative manner, with the aim of generating one (or a
few) construction(s) on a substantial consensus (Guba,
1990). Through this process, the researcher was able to
address from a qualitative perspective whether or not the
funding, program design, and outside program support for
career development and enrichment programs affected the
efficacy of the programs in producing a viable pipeline of
racially/ethnically diverse health professions students.
This study consisted of 10 interviews across the two pro-
grams, Chicago Area Health and Medical Career Program
(CAHMCP) and University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)
Urban Health Program (UHP). Five individuals represented
the CAHMCP Program and five represented the UHP pro-
gram. The results of the interviews were organized around
themes. The interviews contained 15 questions asked of each
of the subjects, the first 4 being demographic in nature, and
the remaining 11 questions subjective and related to the
structure and function of each program--program design
and implementation, institutional commitment, and outside
program support from the local and corporate community.
Before conducting the interviews, a structured interview
guide was developed, which ensured that the interviews
were conducted in a consistent fashion and that all relevant
areas were covered. To ensure the questions were clear and
unambiguous, field-tests were performed via mock inter-
views with five individuals who were either program manag-
ers or members of an academic faculty.
This study, which focuses on factors associated with the
effectiveness and efficiency of minority enrichment pro-
grams, relied heavily on key informants'responses to the fol-
lowing five questions:
1. What is the goal of your enrichment program?
2. How do you measure the success of your program?
3. What are the strengths of your enrichment pro-
gram?
4. What are the barriers to the success of the pro-
grams?
5. What impact do you feel your program has in
improving the pipeline of underrepresented minor-
ities in the health professions?
The responses to Questions 2 through 5 were organized
around themes. The themes are outlined in Table 1.
The analysis consisted of three parts. First, the two minor-
ity enrichment programs in the study are described, includ-
ing a discussion of the similarities and differences among the
groups. Second, the analyses from key informant interviews
with executive and administrative staff of the two programs
in 2005 are presented prior to the cuts in federal funding.
Finally, the findings from the follow-up interviews, which
were conducted with the program directors in early 2008, are
presented.
The program offerings and descriptions came from a vari-
ety of sources. Both programs maintain websites that pro-
vided the program's mission, organizational structure,
program design, activities, and the relationships with their
academic partners. Financial data were obtained from the
annual budget reports for the two programs along with a
review of program's policies and procedures. Furthermore,
the primary researcher toured the offices and facilities of
both programs to obtain additional details of the program.
The interviews with key informants and the administrative
staff provided the most valuable information and provided
additional descriptive information about each program
(described below).
All of the interviewees were directors or in high-level
administrative positions. All had master's degrees, and four
of the interviewees had doctorates. Many of the interviewees
had received graduate training in more than one substantive
area. The most common areas of training were health admin-
istration, public health, and education. Both the CAHMCP
and UHP programs served URM students from the following
Evans et al. 3
groups: African American, Hispanic/Latino, and Native
American/Native Alaskan/Native Hawaiian. Both programs
have representations from Asians and Caucasians. The
CAHMCP program categorizes them as "affiliates, who are
individuals who state they want to serve in health profes-
sions shortage communities," while the UHP program
describes them as "economically and educationally disad-
vantaged individuals." The CAHMCP program also serves
individuals of all races diagnosed with a learning disability.
When asked the question "What is the goal of your enrich-
ment program?" interviewees from both programs gave sim-
ilar responses. This supported the goals of the Illinois Board
of Higher Education's (IBHE) goal of being "dedicated to
proactive efforts regarding the advancement of access and
diversity throughout higher education in Illinois, and extend-
ing the voice of underrepresented student populations." The
Director of CAHMCP states, "To increase the number of
underrepresented minorities in the health professions who
practice in the State of Illinois." And the Executive Director
of the UIC UHP states,
To improve the quality of health care services for
medically underserved urban populations, especially
those in Health Professions Shortage Areas of Illinois,
by expanding health professions education opportuni-
ties for underrepresented groups (African Americans,
Hispanic Americans, Mainland Puerto Ricans, and
Native Americans).
The responses from the other participants were in line
with the themes of each of these quotes.
The Importance of a Diverse Health
Care Workforce
In recent years, a variety of studies have argued that to
increase the diversity of the U.S. health care workforce, a
wide variety of policy enhancements must occur, including
the reduction of health disparities (Cohen et al., 2002;
Sullivan Commission Report, 2004). An increase in the sup-
ply of minority health care providers will likely increase
access to health care in minority communities. Previous
research showed that Black and Hispanic physicians are
especially likely to treat disenfranchised patients and patients
from their own race and ethnicity group (Xu et al., 1997).
Research also found that Blacks and Hispanics as compared
with other physicians are more likely to practice in neigh-
borhoods where a high percentage of the population is from
their own race and ethnicity (Saha, Taggart, Komaromy, &
Bindman, 2000). Increasing the supply of URM physicians
will aid in increasing the degree of racial concordance in
physician­patient relationships. Recent studies found that
minority patients often prefer to be cared for by physicians
of their own race and ethnicity (Saha et al., 2000). When
physicians of their own race and ethnicity treat patients, they
have longer physician visits, have more engaged and respon-
sive interactions with their physicians, have higher utiliza-
tion of health care services, and are less likely to postpone
seeking health care (Saha et al., 2000).
Both the UHP at UIC and the CAHMCP were developed
as outgrowths from community demands resulting in legisla-
tive and policy funding and support. Since their inception in
the late 1970s, much has changed on a national and local
front from a political standpoint, yet Illinois State legislators
have continued to support program funding for these Medical
Health Professional Education Programs (MHPEPs) in part.
Accordingly, the Evans's (2006) report revealed that funding
was identified as the most significant barrier to success for
both programs; CAHMCP 50% and UIC UHP 56%. The
presence of URM students plays a crucial role in preparing a
culturally competent workforce (Cohen et al., 2002). The
groups classified as URM students include ethnic groups
includingAfricanAmerican, Hispanic, and NativeAmericans
whose representation among professionals in health sciences

is disproportionately less than their proportion in the general
population (Toney, 2012). This argument is central to the
University of Michigan's defense against antiaffirmative
action lawsuits that challenged the admissions policies to
their undergraduate school and law school (Cohen et al.,
2002). A more diverse health care workforce will lead to
greater diversity among medically trained health care man-
agers, policy makers, and researchers, who in turn may
increase the promotion and development of health policies
and health care research priorities that would better suit the
needs of the increasingly diverse U.S. population (Cohen
et al., 2002).
Efforts to Increase URMs in the
Health Professions
Any effort to improve health care services or control costs
must consider the supply, distribution, use, and education of
the health care workforce (Kovner & Salisburg, 1999). The
health care workforce is large and diverse. It ranges from
highly educated and highly paid professionals to caregivers,
skilled technicians, and semiskilled workers. In 1994, there
were approximately 12 million health care workers, which
represent approximately 10% of the nation's total workforce.
By the year 2018, the Department of Labor projected that
health care services would jump to 15.3 million or 10.1%.
Concerning the period 2008-2018, a number of reports
and studies indicate that there is a need to produce sufficient
numbers and types of health professionals to meet the
demands of a diverse society (Gupta & Konrad, 1992).
Findings of the 1993 Pew Report stated that nurses and allied
health professionals would be essential players on the future
primary and preventive health care system. In addition, the
report emphasized the need to increase the number of minor-
ity health professionals, which was also a goal of the Healthy
People 2000 initiative and was carried over in the Healthy
People 2010 efforts (U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 2000).
One of the main barriers to better URM representation is
the costs associated with health professions education. Many
URM students do not have the economic resources required
to finance a health profession career. In accordance with the
National Institute of Medicine (IOM; 2004), on average,
URM student resources are more limited compared with
their majority counterparts: "Because of the cost barrier to
URM students, they may be discouraged from entering
health professions training programs when faced with the
prospect of high debt" (p. 23). Many leaders in the health
care field have called for a reexamination of the costs and
financing of health professions training to significantly
reduce or eliminate many training costs, particularly for
those students who serve in the public sector. Promoting and
encouraging health professionals to work in health care
shortage areas are likely to increase access to care for medi-
cally underserved populations.
Public and private organizations have tackled the chal-
lenge and designed initiatives to assist URM students in
financing the costs of their education and training. Some
provide direct financial assistance to students and others
indirectly support URM students through funding provided
to institutions for diversity activities. All of the organiza-
tions, however, provide support to increase URM participa-
tion in health professions and reduce financial barriers,
directly or indirectly, for students who experience difficulty
financing their training (Transportation Research Board,
2003).
Another challenge to achieving better URM representa-
tion in health professions training programs relates to admis-
sions policies and practices, which vary widely from
discipline to discipline and among institutions. These varia-
tions are reflected in the differences in entrance require-
ments, discipline-specific criteria, and institutional mission.
Almost all of the policies include standardized admission
test data and qualitative information (e.g., applicants' per-
sonal characteristics, background, and motivation to enter
health professions fields) to arrive at admissions decisions.
Policies and practices influence racial and ethnic diversity in
graduate health professions training programs. Standardized,
norm-referenced tests (e.g., the Medical College Admission
Test [MCAT], Dental Aptitude Test [DAT], and Graduate
Record Examination [GRE]) are still critical in the admis-
sions process. The IOM suggests that alternative admission
models should be reviewed as well as their implications for
URM applicant success in the admissions process. Finally, it
is very important that organizations have an institutional cli-
mate for diversity. This includes strategies that encourage the
introduction of diverse viewpoints and an appreciation of the
uniqueness of the individual and the richness of the culture
and backgrounds of the students. In most cases, there needs
to be "holistic" institutional change. Evidence suggests that
efforts to enhance diversity require comprehensive, system-
atic changes in the way institutions value and respond to
diversity. By themselves, diversity programs (e.g., sensitiv-
ity training, cultural programs, and workshops) are unlikely
to affect meaningful change absent systemic, integrated
diversity efforts.
Diversity must be institutionalized and leaders--
including university presidents, deans, governance bodies,
department chairs, and other administrators--must clearly
articulate the importance of diversity for the institutional
mission. In addition, institutional leaders must establish
clear guidance for all students, faculty, and staff regarding
diversity goals and the roles all members of the campus com-
munity must adopt to attain diversity and inclusion goals.
Minority Enrichment Programs
Many medical schools and universities have established
minority enrichment programs to promote careers in the
health professions among students from URM groups and
Evans et al. 5
among students who are economically disadvantaged. The
support services provided by these programs may include
personal counseling, the development of study skills, assis-
tance in test preparation, networking opportunities, and
financial assistance.
Minority enrichment programs vary considerably in orga-
nization and format. For example, summer enrichment pro-
grams, which typically last for several weeks, are designed
to increase interest in the health professions and to help stu-
dents successfully compete for admission into professional
schools. On the other end of the spectrum, pipeline programs
maintain long-term relationships with students, by providing
support from high school to the completion of their training
and entry into health professions.
Research Questions
Research Questions 1: Does funding, program design,
and program support influence the effectiveness
of career development and enrichment programs
in improving the pipeline of racially/ethnically
diverse students in the health care field?
Research Questions 2: Do the CAHMCP and UIC
UHP have differences in their respective designs
that have a positive or negative impact on the pro-
gram's effectiveness?
Research Questions 3: How have the funding cuts from
the government affected programs in continuing to
improve the pipeline of racially/ethnically diverse
students for the health care field?
Our study interviewed staff members from two minority
enrichment programs in Chicago, Illinois: the CAHMCP
(pronounced "Champ") based at the Illinois Institute of
Technology and the UHP at the UIC.
A consortium consisting of the Illinois Institute of
Technology and seven Chicago-area medical schools estab-
lished CAHMCP (CAHMCP Description, 2006). Its mission
was to increase the number of students from URM groups
who are admitted to and graduate from Illinois medical
schools. Later, the scope of CAHMCP's mission was
expanded to include health professions other than medicine
(e.g., dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, public health, etc.).
CAHMCP identifies and recruits participants to the program
at an early point in their academic development and provides
academic counseling, motivation, and financial support until
their entry into one of the health professions.
The UHP at the UIC has the mission of recruiting minor-
ity students into the health professions who wish, upon grad-
uation, to practice in medically underserved urban areas
(Amuwo, Scrimshaw, Adefuye, & Washington-Calvin,
2006). The program coordinates programs in each of six
health colleges within the UIC system (medicine, dentistry,
nursing, pharmacy, public health, and applied health sci-
ence), including graduate programs. In addition, UHP
collaborates with the UIC's Early Outreach Program, which
identifies talented minority students early in their academic
careers and grooms them for college. It also collaborates
with the UIC's Academic Center for Excellence to provide
advice and academic counseling to university undergradu-
ates who plan to enter the health professions.
Findings
CAHMCP and UHP are similar in a number of respects.
Both programs began in the late 1970s, UHP in 1978 and
CAHMCP in 1979. Their missions are comparable. Both are
longitudinal intervention or "pipeline" programs, which
identify and recruit promising middle school and high
school students and provide them with academic and moti-
vational support to develop the basic skills needed for a
career in the health professions. With both programs, this
support continues while they complete their training. Both
programs target URM students, includingAfricanAmericans,
Hispanics/Latinos, Native Americans, Native Alaskans, and
Native Hawaiians. CAHMCP includes a small number of
Asians and Caucasians who have indicated a desire to serve
in health professional shortage areas. The UHP program
includes "economically and educationally disadvantaged
individuals" of all races and ethnicities (CAHMCP
Description, 2006).
There are also several significant differences between the
CAHMCP and UHP programs. First, the two programs differ
in their internal organization and in their relationships with
affiliated institutions. CAHMCP serves a variety of medical
schools, dental schools, and other health professions schools.
However, it operates as an independent not-for-profit proj-
ect. It is housed on the campus of the Illinois Institute of
Technology but it has no direct ties to that university. In con-
trast, UHP is affiliated with only the UIC. Its activities are
divided across eight colleges and programs. UHP's opera-
tions are, in some respects, more decentralized than
CAHMCP's program, with the fact that the respective deans
of each of the major health professions school control and
execute the programs independently.
Another major difference between the two programs is
how the programs are funded. UHP receives both state and
federal funding, augmented by foundation grants received
directly by the colleges. CAHMCP, however, receives a
direct appropriation from the IBHE. CAHMCP received an
average of US$720,000 from the state to run its programs
between the years 2000 and 2004, while UHP only received
US$90,000. Although UHP received far less money from the
state, it received much more money from other sources. The
total UHP program operated on an average budget of
US$1,566,185 within the academic years 2000-2004.
There are also differences in how the two programs are
staffed. The CAHMCP program operates with seven paid
full-time employees (FTE). The UHP program operates with
four FTEs in a central office and an additional eight FTEs
6 SAGE Open
who are employed by the Deans of the Colleges of Medicine,
Dentistry, Public Health, Pharmacy, Graduate Studies, and
Allied Health Sciences. There are an additional two FTEs in
the Early Outreach Program and the Office of Admissions
and Records.
Results From the Initial Key
Informant Interviews
Program Goals (Table 1) identifies the themes used to pres-
ent findings from key informant interviews. When asked the
question, "What is the goal of your enrichment program?"
key informants from both the CAHMCP and UHP programs
gave similar responses. The Director of CAHMCP stated
that the mission of that program is "to increase the number
of underrepresented minorities in the health professions who
practice in the State of Illinois." Similarly, the Executive
Director of the UHP program stated that the mission of that
program is
[t]o improve the quality of health care services for
medically underserved urban populations, especially
those in Health Professions Shortage Areas of Illinois,
by expanding health professions education opportuni-
ties for underrepresented groups (African Americans,
Hispanic Americans, Mainland Puerto Ricans, and
Native Americans).
The responses from the other key informants were in line
with the statements made by the program directors. Thus,
the goals of both programs, as stated by the program direc-
tors and other key informants, strongly support the IBHE's
goals of "proactive efforts regarding the advancement of
access and diversity throughout higher education in Illinois,
and extend[ing] the voice of underrepresented student popu-
lations" (CAHMCP Description, 2006).
Measures of Success (Table 2) present the key informant
responses to the question "How do you measure the success
of your program?" The most frequent responses among
CAHMCP key informants indicated the percentage of stu-
dents who enter the health professions and the number
admitted to professional programs as the key measure of suc-
cess. The key informants stated that they measure success by
"the number of underrepresented students provided the
opportunity to pursue a career in a professional health pro-
gram" and by measuring "the number of students who
matriculate from one level to the next."
The most frequent response among UHP key informants
stated that the number of students who graduate from a
health professions program is the key metric to success.
However, some key informants also measured program suc-
cess by other milestones in the students' academic career--
for example, the numbers who are recruited into the program,
who are admitted to professional programs, and who eventu-
ally enter the health professions. One UHP key informant
stated, "Every program component is evaluated individually.
Each student is tracked to monitor their improvement in
math, science and test results, especially in verbal and quan-
titative sections." Another key informant included as a mea-
sure of program success, "the number of individuals who
return to serve the underrepresented communities of the
State of Illinois."
Program Strengths (Table 3) presents key informant
responses to the question "What are the strengths of your
enrichment program?" One of the most frequent responses
emphasized the support provided to students in the program
as their key strength. A key informant from UHP listed as
important program strengths "the academic support and
counseling provided to students, review materials, tutoring,
outreach, and stipends."
Key informants from both programs considered the qual-
ity of faculty and staff to be strength. In addition, the staff of
both programs considered the long-term relationships with
students to be an important strength. A UHP key informant
stated that, "a major strength is the ability to follow students
through training and practice." Similarly, a CAHMCP key
informant noted that the program "functions as a family; par-
ticipation is life long."
Barriers to Success (Table 4) presents key informant
responses to the question "What are the barriers to the suc-
cess of the programs?" The key informants from both pro-
grams considered the lack of resources and funding to be a
significant barrier. A CAHMCP key informant noted that
there was "not enough money or human resources to sup-
port additional students or expand programs" and that "state
budgets cuts threaten continuation of the program." Funding
concerns are also evident in the responses about the lack of
resources to provide student support. A CAHMCP key
informant noted the lack of "appropriate funding necessary
to support students who have financial difficulties" and the
lack of funds for "diagnostic testing and supplemental
courses." In both programs, there were concerns that the
lack of program visibility might present a barrier to the pro-
gram's success. In addition, a number of UHP key infor-
mants expressed concerns about the university not fully
engaged and accepting of the program's mission. One key
informant stated, "the barriers to the success of the program
consist of a lack of acceptance of the program by some fac-
ulty and administrators." Another stated that, "some of the
admissions and faculty members are indifferent to the uni-
versity's diversity goals." A third noted that there was "push
back from majority students and faculty." A fourth UHP key
informant indicated that the program faced obstacles pre-
sented by the entire educational system. "Students are not
being prepared properly for higher education. Some of the
reasons for this are social economic factors, educational
achievement of the parents, financial support, family sup-
port, and low self-esteem."
Impact of the Program (Table 5) presents the distribu-
tions of responses to the question "What impact do you
Evans et al. 7
believe your program has had in improving the pipeline
of underrepresented minorities in the health profes-
sions?" In general, the key informants believed their
impact was evident in the number of students entering the
health professions and the number admitted into profes-
sional training programs. A CAHMCP key informant
noted that, "our programs have prevented the state of
Illinois from having a large deficit in the numbers of
underrepresented health professionals." Similarly, a key
informant from UHP noted,
The program has definitely contributed to improving
the pipeline of underrepresented minorities in the
health professions. This is illustrated through the num-
ber of graduates from the UIC medical program. If the
program were discontinued, students would have dif-
ficulties in the program, which could lead to dismissal.
The pipeline would be disrupted.
Follow-Up Interviews With Program
Directors
Follow-up interviews were conducted with the directors of
both of the programs highlighted in the initial study to deter-
mine what if any changes have resulted from the federal cuts
in the programs' funding. According to CAHMCP data,
since the early 1980s, the program's "pipeline" has been
traversed by more than 4,000 individuals who have earned
at least baccalaureates in the sciences and more than 1,300
of whom have gone on to be medicine, osteopathy, dentistry,
veterinary science, optometry, pharmacy, public health, and
podiatry (MODVOPPP) professionals. A CAHMCP middle
school­level student has better than a 95% probability of
completing college in 5 years or less and a 80% probability
of being enrolled in postbaccalaureate degree study within 2
years following completion of his or her undergraduate
degree. CAHMCP grads also include professionals such as

educators at all levels, practitioners in law, stock brokers,
engineers of nearly all stripes, business persons, elected
political representatives, journalists, visual and performing
artists, public administrators, environmental scientists, mili-
tary officers, social scientists, and theologians. In fiscal year
2007, the state legislature through the IBHE awarded the
program US$800,000 of new funding because of this sus-
tained history of success. CAHMCP was able to bridge the
budget cuts in fiscal year 2003 through philanthropy and a
significant grant from State Farm Insurance Company.
For fiscal year 2009, the Governor and General Assembly
appropriated US$3.9 million to the IBHE for grants to the
CAHMCP, the Illinois Math and Science Academy
Excellence 2000 Program, and the University Center of Lake
County. The CAHMCP program received US$900,000
of this appropriation. These grants are designated under
IBHE administrative rules; that is, the purposes of
the appropriations are specified. These funds will allow this
program to continue their legacy of successfully increasing
the number of minority students entering medicine, dentistry,
and other health care disciplines.
The UIC did not fare as well and their program suffered
substantial decreases in funding. The IBHE only awarded
UIC US$71,829. This funding level only allowed them the
ability to continue one program in collaboration with
Chicago Public Schools (CPS), which proposed to imple-
ment the Window to Academic Success, a program to sup-
port UIC and Chicago State University's (CSU) early
intervention programs that motivates and prepares elemen-
tary and secondary students to pursue higher education, and
strengthen and expand the pipeline for health profession pro-
grams. This application meets the goals of Illinois's commit-
ment to "Increase the number and diversity of citizens
completing training and education programs." The rest of the

programs to increase minority representation in the health
professions were moved back to the individual colleges with
only a coordinating role from the UHP. The UIC has state
commitment, even with the funding cuts to continue to sup-
port the UHP's mission to improve the quality of health care
services for medically underserved urban populations.
Special focus on those in Health Professions Shortage Areas
of Illinois is given by expanding health professions educa-
tion opportunities for underrepresented groups (African
Americans, Hispanic Americans, Mainland Puerto Ricans,
and Native Americans). The UIC celebrated their 30-year
anniversary of the program and proudly profess that approxi-
mately 70% of the African American and Latino physicians
who practice in Chicago are UIC graduates. The journal
Black Issues in Higher Education has ranked UIC third for
the past 15 years among the top 100 institutions in granting
medical degrees to minority students.
Discussion
URM students are more likely than non-URM students to
come from low-income families; however, most low-income
students are White. Policies that solely target financial sup-
port to low-income students may or may not successfully
help URM students to access and succeed in health profes-
sions training programs. Therefore, it is important to imple-
ment financial strategies in conjunction with other
"race-conscious" interventions targeting, for example,
admissions and accreditation policies.
Contributing to the problem is the recent attack on
programs that attempted to improve diversity in higher
education--for example, the lawsuits filed against the
University of Michigan and the University of California pro-
grams. Another example is the affirmative action rollbacks
across several states that produced severe reductions in
African Americans in college, law, and medical school
admissions (Turner, González, & Wood, 2008). The sudden
and radical change in African American enrollments lead
one to the racial scoring gap between African Americans and
Caucasians on standardized business school admissions tests
(Turner et al., 2008). In a race-blind admissions system,
admissions officers must rely heavily on test scores. Because
of grade inflation and extreme differences in academic rigor
between various undergraduate institutions, grade point
averages from different schools are of little value to officials
who must decide whether to admit a given student. In a race-
blind admissions environment, scoring results on standard-
ized admissions tests will lead to the rejection of all but a
small percentage of African American applicants.
Implications for Future Research
This study suggested the need for further research in the area
of developing the health professions workforce and ensuring
the diversity of that workforce. This study only addressed
the pipeline of URM students in a few targeted health pro-
fessions. A logical follow-up study could address additional
research to assess diversity among health professionals not
only within medical careers but also in executive administra-
tion and academia. This will further identify the benefits of
diversity for holistic health care service delivery system.
This study did not address comparisons between individ-
uals who participated in the MHPEP and those who did not
because of data limitations. The data from such a study could
answer in a quantitative way the impact of the programs.
Another area for further study could include studying quali-
tative attributes of applicants that may more accurately pre-
dict success in health professions careers (e.g., patient
sensitivity, leadership, commitment to service, cultural
competence, linguistic ability, and interpersonal skills).
Furthermore, an interesting research area could compare the
peak years of URM participation in the mid-1990s to current
years, to determine whether there was a reduction in URM
applicants and evaluate the causes of those reductions.
Study Limitations
After collecting the data related to student participation in
the two MHPEP programs, some important limitations were
discovered that prevented testing of the original hypothesis.
The most important limitation was that the data available
were for those individuals who participated in the MHPEP
programs. To test the hypothesis related to the programs'
ability to ensure entrance into professional school, data
would be needed on two groups of individuals: those who
participated in MHPEP and those who did not. If those data
were available, the study could measure odds of admission
based on the participation in the MHPEP program. Because
of the aforementioned limitation, an alternative analysis plan
was developed and an alternative hypothesis was con-
structed and used in the study.
The interaction and influences of three factors limited the
interpretations and conclusions of this study: the researcher's
biases, the interpretive method, and the selection of the case.
These factors, although limiting, are acceptable components
of qualitative research methodology. Outcome bias can result
from the use of unreliable methods or instruments as well as
inadequate sample size or comparison groups. Selection bias
can also exist in the admission requirements between the dif-
ferent universities. The CAHMCP program, for instance, had
a special relationship with Rosalyn Franklin School of the
Health Professions (formerly Chicago Medical School),
which worked with the CAHMCP program to ensure the
most favorable outcome for the students. The two MHPEP
programs serve a similar demographic population, but there
are differences in the program offerings and approaches. In
addition, each program had dissimilar levels of support and/
or resources.
There are a number of ways to ensure the reliability and
validity of this research study. The comparative case study
10 SAGE Open
approach strengthened the external validity of the research.
To ensure internal validity, the tools used to collect the data
were standardized to clearly define the scope and purpose of
the study. In addition, the questions were field-tested on
three program directors to ensure they were creditable and
well understood. The study focused on the intended con-
struct and purpose of the study, and not on any other problem
or issue. However, as the interviews were not tape-recorded,
the interpretation of the notes was susceptible to recall bias.
This made the researcher depend solely on the ability to
interpret the notes accurately.
Conclusion
This study is supported by the literature and illustrates that
the CAHMCP and UIC UHP programs are effective in pro-
ducing a pipeline of URM health professionals. Both pro-
grams are, however, at risk due to the recent funding cut
both at the state and at federal levels makes it difficult for the
programs to continue. A further review of UIC UHP gradu-
ates and enrollees shows that the average number of enroll-
ees from 2000-2004 was 737 students; when compared with
the 2007-2011 findings (1,095 students enrolled), it is con-
cluded that enrollment for the MHPEPprogram has improved
vastly over the compared period by 48%. The average UHP
number of graduates across all colleges from 2000-2004 was
201 students; when compared with a 2007-2011 program
review (233 average students graduated), it is concluded that
graduation rates also improved at approximately 16% over
the compared years. There continues to be a growing propor-
tion of people from ethnic minority groups in the U.S. popu-
lation and still there is a glaring shortage of minority health
professionals and researchers in the country. This disparity
is expected to worsen during the coming decades. Data sup-
port the fact that Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians
comprise 26% of the U.S. population and they receive only
16% of the undergraduate degrees and 9% of the doctoral
degrees in science and engineering (Shavers et al., 2005).
Only 11% of psychology PhD recipients are members of
these URM groups (Olson & Fagen, 2007). The National
Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that between 1999 and
2003, 4.6% of individuals with support from individual or
institutional research training grants of different types (e.g.,
F31, K01, K08, T32, T34, or T35) were Black, 5.6% were
Hispanic, and 0.18% were American Indian. The National
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) reported that in 1998,
16.9% of T32 trainees were Black, Hispanic, or American
Indian (NIH, 2001). Although about 10% of NIH trainees
are members of these ethnic minority groups, they make up
only 3% to 4% of the principal investigators on NIH- and
NIMH-funded research and program grants (Shavers et al.,
2005). Shortages of health professionals in the United States
in general and URM health professionals in particular will
have a serious impact on health care in the next 10 years. In
2001, the American Hospital Association (AHA) predicted
shortages of health care workers. The association surveyed
hospital vacancies and found shortages of more than 10%
for nurses, imaging/radiology technicians, and pharmacists.
Similarly, high vacancy rates were seen across urban/rural
settings and different regions of the country. Over one in
seven hospitals report a severe shortage of nurses with more
than 20% of RN positions vacant (AHA, 2001). These trends
are continuing while the population is aging. The uninsured
and underinsured are continuing to grow and disparities
abound. Programs similar to the two in this study are critical
in continuing to have a viable URM pipeline to the health
professions.
