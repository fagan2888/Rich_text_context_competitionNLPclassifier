Anemia is an important public health concern. Data from population-based surveys such as the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) are the gold standard, but are obtained infrequently
and include only small samples from certain minority groups. We assessed whether readily available data-
bases of blood donor hemoglobin values could be used as a surrogate for population hemoglobin values
from NHANES. Blood donor venous and fingerstick hemoglobin values were compared to 10,254 NHANES
2005-2008 venous hemoglobin values using demographically stratified analyses and ANOVA. Fingerstick
hemoglobins or hematocrits were converted to venous hemoglobin estimates using regression analysis.
Venous hemoglobin values from 1,609 first time donors correlated extremely well with NHANES data
across different ages, genders, and demographic groups. Cigarette smoking increased hemoglobin by
0.26­0.59 g/dL depending on the intensity. Converted fingerstick hemoglobin from 36,793 first time donors
agreed well with NHANES hemoglobin (weighted mean hemoglobin of 15.53 g/dL for donors and 15.73 g/dL
for NHANES) with similar variation in mean hemoglobin by age. However, compared to NHANES, the larger
donor data set showed reduced differences in mean hemoglobin between Blacks and other races/ethnic-
ities. Overall, first-time donor fingerstick hemoglobins approximate US population data and represent a
readily available public health resource for ongoing anemia surveillance. Am. J. Hematol. 87:496­502,

Introduction
Population-based measures of hemoglobin are important
for surveillance of anemia, which has attracted increasing
interest as a significant public health concern [1]. Anemia is
associated with reduced cognitive function in women of
child-bearing age [2] and increased cardiovascular morbid-
ity/mortality in those older than 65 years [3,4]. Anemia
disproportionately affects women and minorities [5]. In addi-
tion, the prevalence of anemia increases significantly with
age and is present in 10% of those more than 65 and 20%
of those older than 85 years [6]. The importance of anemia
in the elderly will increase in the next 20 years as baby
boomers age. In persons of all ages, amelioration of
anemia has been shown to decrease the morbidity and
mortality of associated disease [2].
National estimates of hemoglobin and anemia are usually
calculated using data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES) [5,7]. This survey utilizes
sophisticated samples designed to be representative of the
US population, but is limited by moderate sample size and
periodic sampling in time. In contrast, blood donors are a
very large population ranging in age from 16 to older than
80 years who are routinely tested for hemoglobin as part of
the predonation qualification process. Although most blood
donors are white, there are also large numbers of donors
from minority groups. In recent years, point-of-care mea-
surement of quantitative fingerstick hematocrit or hemoglo-
bin has replaced the qualitative copper sulfate density
method, and the data are now being captured in large
blood donor databases.
In 2006, 9.5 million individuals donated 15.7 million units
of whole blood in the United States. Of these blood donors,
2.7 million (28.5%) were first-time donors [8]. In addition to
these successful donors, approximately 1 million individuals
present to donate each year but are ineligible to do so
because of hemoglobin below the 12.5 g/dL cutoff required
for blood donation. Tracking demographic variation and sec-
ular trends in hemoglobin values provides an opportunity to
readily identify the changes in the prevalence of anemia in
the United States. If the prevalence of anemia in the blood
donor population reflects that of the overall population, the
public health value of this readily available laboratory data
is significant.
We therefore addressed, in a stepwise fashion, the
research question of how closely hemoglobin data from four
regional blood centers correlate with contemporaneous
NHANES data. First, we compared venous hemoglobins in a
subset of well-characterized donors to NHANES venous
hemoglobins. Next, we performed a much larger comparison
of donor fingerstick hemoglobin and hematocrit measure-
ments using a correction factor to approximate venous he-
moglobin. Our finding that blood donor data correlate well
with NHANES data validates blood donors as a new and
readily available source of hemoglobin measurement for pub-
lic health surveillance of anemia among otherwise healthy,
community-dwelling individuals in the United States.

Red Cross, New England Region, Boston, MA; the Blood Center of Wis-
consin, Milwaukee, WI; the Hoxworth Blood Center, Cincinnati, OH; and
the Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA. The other two
REDS-II centers followed similar procedures but were excluded from this
analysis because they did not perform complete blood count analyses on
an automated hematology analyzer. Three sources of data were used for
this analysis and are discussed in the following paragraphs: (1) Quantita-
tive venous hemoglobin from blood donors enrolled in the REDS-II Donor
Iron Status Evaluation (RISE) study; (2) Quantitative fingerstick hemoglo-
bin/hematocrit from a larger set of REDS-II blood donors; and (3)
Quantitative venous hemoglobin from participants in the 2005­2006 and
2007­2008 NHANES. All subjects in RISE and REDS-II gave informed
consent, and protocols were consistent with ethical standards and
approved by institutional review boards at each center.
Quantitative venous hemoglobin from blood donors in the RISE
study. The RISE study enrolled 1,624 subjects, 18 years of age or
older, and who donated a unit of whole blood or double red cells at the
four centers between January 1, 2008 and May 31, 2008. Thus, all
enrolled donors had a fingerstick hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL. Of these
subjects, 621 were first-time donors or reactivated donors (no dona-
tions in the previous 24 months). The remaining 1,003 subjects were
regular whole-blood donors, men with three or more donations in the
previous 12 months and women with two or more donations in the pre-
vious 12 months. Further details regarding RISE including the enroll-
ment procedures and donor demographics for the entire sample have
been reported [9,10]. Hemoglobin values were measured on venous
blood on samples obtained at enrollment using ADVIA1 2120 or
ADVIA1 120 Hematology Autoanalyzers (Siemens, Tarrytown, NY).
Quantitative fingerstick hemoglobin/hematocrit from blood donors in
the REDS-II database. Shared data on all blood donations and defer-
rals of REDS-II donors are compiled into a centralized research data-
bases at the REDS-II coordinating center (Westat, Rockville, MD). In
addition to information on the donation or deferral such as donation
procedure, donation type or deferral codes, the database also contains
donor demographic data, including gender, race/ethnicity, and date of
birth. For two of the years of REDS-II data collection, quantitative fin-
gerstick hemoglobin (two centers) or hematocrit (two centers) values
for both donations and deferrals were reported by REDS-II centers on
the majority of both their accepted donors and deferred donors. This
analysis was limited to the donation and deferral records of first-time
donor visits made between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008 at
these centers. There were 51,091 first-time donor records of which
36,793 had a quantitative fingerstick measure. Donors were classified
as first-time based on their response to the question ``Is this the first
time you've ever given blood'' on a self-reported form.
Quantitative venous hemoglobin from participants in the 2005­2006
and 2007­2008 NHANES. The National Center for Health Statistics of
the Centers for Disease Control conducts the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2-year cycles. NHANES
participants are selected using a stratified, multistage probability design
to represent the total civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. The
procedures for consent, data collection and analysis are published
elsewhere [11,12]. The sampling weights for the NHANES data include
a poststratification adjustment so that the NHANES distribution is
standardized to the March Current Population Survey (CPS) estimate
of the US population distribution (Sylvia Dohrmann [Westat, Rockville,
MD] June 7, 2010, personal communication).
Data for NHANES are collected through household interviews and
physical examinations at Mobile Examination Centers. Hemoglobin val-
ues are measured as part of a complete blood count using the Beck-
man Coulter MAXM hematology flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Full-
erton, CA) [13,14].
We combined data from two cycles of NHANES (NHANES 2005­
2006 and NHANES 2007­2008) to form our comparison population as
the way that hemoglobin was measured did not differ for these two
cycles of NHANES. This was performed to increase the statistical
power of this current analysis. From 2005 to 2008, the NHANES sam-
ple included 10,254 participants who were 18 or older, not pregnant,
and had hemoglobin results (5,175 men and 5,079 nonpregnant
women). Self-reported pregnancy status was used to exclude pregnant
women.
Statistical analysis--comparison of RISE to NHANES. The RISE
data set was restricted to donors at enrollment at the four selected
blood centers. To compare the RISE and NHANES hemoglobin distri-
butions, it was necessary to adjust for the different characteristics of
the two populations. A weight variable was developed for the RISE
data set such that these strata (i.e., gender, age, race, and smoking
habit distributions) in RISE were standardized to the CPS estimate of
the US population distribution. Hemoglobin probability density functions
(Fig. 1A,B) are based on the standardized population (i.e., the RISE
first-time/reactivated donor sample, the RISE repeat donor sample, and
NHANES samples are each standardized to the US population).
In separate analyses, mean hemoglobin values were calculated for
RISE first-time/reactivated donors, RISE repeat donors and NHANES
subjects at the strata level. The mean and standard errors for the
NHANES strata were calculated using Proc Surveymeans (SAS version
9.1) to properly account for the complex survey design (i.e., NHANES
data were weighted). RISE donors were treated as self-representing
(i.e., RISE data were not weighted). Mean differences were calculated
for each stratum and aggregated for the combinations of gender and
donor status (e.g., first-time/reactivated or repeat males compared to
NHANES males), using the RISE sample to weight the calculations.
Standard errors for the mean differences were calculated based on the
sum of standard errors from the two mean analyses and assumed to
be independent.
Finally, RISE FT/RA donors and NHANES data were combined into
a single data set and analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) as
shown in Appendix. For this analysis, no weight variable was used
(each record was self-representing). The motivation for this analysis
was to test for a center effect relative to NHANES after controlling for
gender, age, race/ethnicity, and smoking intensity. NHANES is used as
a reference group for analyzing the center effect.
Statistical analysis--Comparison of REDS-II to NHANES. The
REDS-II data set was restricted to first-time donors who donated in
2007­2008 at the four selected blood centers (n 5 51,202). Values
from fingerstick hemoglobin and hematocrit were converted to esti-
mates of venous hemoglobin using a regression model that estimated
venous hemoglobin from fingerstick values from the RISE data [15].
For each center, a separate regression model was developed for the
conversion of fingerstick measurement to venous hemoglobin using the
fingerstick measurement and gender as predictors.
The REDS-II quantitative fingerstick values were missing or not
recorded in the database in 28% of the records, and thus the analysis
was performed on 36,793 donors. As blood centers vary in the order of
operations in qualifying blood donors (i.e., the order of donor history
questionnaire or fingerstick hemoglobin), some donors were deferred
for behavioral characteristics before their hemoglobin could be deter-
mined. To compensate for missing values, a weight variable was calcu-
lated for each record with nonmissing fingerstick values to mitigate bias
in the analysis. A separate weighting procedure was used based on
the order of qualifying operations at blood centers. A weight class was

defined by gender, age, and race/ethnicity; factors known to affect
hemoglobin. The smoking habits of the 36,793 REDS-II donors were not
recorded and, therefore, no adjustments for smoking could be made.
Anemia prevalence was calculated for both data sets using the same he-
moglobin cutoffs of <13.5 g/dL for men and <12.0 g/dL for women.
Separate ANOVAs were applied to the combined NHANES data
(2005­2008) and the REDS-II data. Both analyses used their respec-
tive weights and the same model parameterization except that the
REDS-II model included a blood center effect.
Results
Study populations
The study included a total of 1,609 blood donors partici-
pating in RISE; 36,793 first-time blood donors with finger-
stick hemoglobin or hematocrit values participating in the
parent REDS-II study (some of whom may have also been
enrolled in the RISE study); and 10,254 NHANES 2005­
2008 subjects with venous hemoglobin values. Demo-
graphic characteristics of the three-study populations are
summarized in Table I. First-time REDS-II donors were
younger and slightly more likely to be female than RISE or
NHANES subjects. Minority representation was greatest in
NHANES, followed by REDS-II and then RISE.
Comparison of RISE blood donor venous hemoglobins
to NHANES 2005­20008
To determine the validity of comparing blood donor he-
moglobin values to those of the general population, we first
compared the venous hemoglobins measured by autoana-
lyzers in the RISE study to similar data from NHANES
2005­2008. Cigarette smoking was found to be an impor-
tant factor (ANOVA analysis) in explaining hemoglobin. As
the smoking rate is generally lower in blood donors than in
the general population, smoking intensity was included in
all three RISE analyses. Distributions of hemoglobin values
from the subset of blood donors enrolled in the RISE study
with a venous hemoglobin measured by autoanalyzer and
those from NHANES 2005­2008 are shown in Fig. 1A,B for
men and women, respectively. For males, values from
RISE first-time and repeat blood donors closely approxi-
mate those from NHANES 2005­2008, although there are
proportionally fewer RISE than NHANES subjects with high
hemoglobin values in the right ``tails'' and more RISE than
NHANES subjects with lower hemoglobins in the left ``tails''
of the curves. For females, again the RISE data approxi-
mate the NHANES data although there are proportionally
more RISE than NHANES females near mean hemoglobin
values, as indicated by higher peaks and narrower tails of
the RISE distributions. Distribution curves for female RISE
repeat blood donors are shifted slightly to the left compared
to female RISE first-time donors, indicating lower hemoglo-
bin values likely owing to the previous blood donation.
Overall differences in mean hemoglobin were calculated
after stratifying each study population according to sex,
age, race, and cigarette smoking intensity. Compared to
NHANES 2005­2008, RISE first-time blood donors had he-
moglobin values that were overall 0.23 g/dL lower in men,
and 0.01 g/dL higher in women. Again, compared to
NHANES 2005­2008, RISE repeat blood donors had mean
hemoglobin values that were overall 0.40 g/dL lower in men
and 0.25 g/dL lower in women, reflecting losses owing to
the previous blood donation. Finally, center-to-center vari-
ability was observed between the four RISE centers after
controlling for sex, age, race, and cigarette smoking inten-
sity, with relative differences compared to NHANES 2005­
2008 of 10.38, 20.12, 20.10, and 20.39 g/dL. This was
despite all four centers using the same methodology of
obtaining venous hemoglobin results (Appendix). This anal-
ysis also highlighted the importance of adjusting for ciga-
rette smoking when comparing the two databases. In the
combined RISE and NHANES ANOVA analysis, persons
smoking 10 cigarettes per day had hemoglobin 0.26 g/dL
higher and those smoking 11 or more cigarettes per day
had hemoglobin 0.59 g/dL higher than nonsmokers.
Comparison of REDS-II blood donor fingerstick
hemoglobins to NHANES 2005­2008
The overall agreement between RISE blood donor and
NHANES 2005­2008 hemoglobin values described above
led us to extend the comparison more broadly to a much
larger blood donor data set of fingerstick hemoglobin meas-
urements obtained using point of care devices or microcen-
trifuge spun hematocrit. For all comparisons, estimated
venous hemoglobin values were derived from fingerstick
hemoglobin values using a correction factor obtained from
a regression analysis of RISE blood donors with simultane-
ous venous and fingerstick hemoglobin measurements.
Hemoglobin values of demographic subgroups for both
the REDS-II first-time donor and the NHANES 2005-08
data sets were compared using separate ANOVA models
(Table II and Figs. 2 and 3A,B). Comparison by smoking
intensity was not possible because this variable is not avail-
able for the REDS-II data set. Generally, similar associa-
tions between hemoglobin and age and sex were observed
for both data sets. For men, mean hemoglobin declined
with age with small differences between NHANES and
REDS-II data except for the oldest ages (Fig. 2). For
women, differences in mean hemoglobin were smaller
between the two data sets and hemoglobin did not vary
much with age, although a slight uptick was observed in
postmenopausal women for both data sets (Fig. 2). The
main exception to similarity between the REDS-II and
the NHANES 2005-8 data sets was seen in reduced
differences in hemoglobin between Blacks and other
races. Specifically, Black men had hemoglobin values only
0.29 g/dL less than White men in the REDS-II data set,
whereas their hemoglobin was 0.89 g/dL less than White
men in the NHANES data set. For Black women, their
hemoglobin was 0.48 g/dL less than White women in the
REDS-II data set, whereas hemoglobins were 1.03 g/dL
less than White women in the NHANES 2005­2008 data
set (Table II). In other words, the differences between
REDS-II and NHANES were reduced or reversed in Blacks
compared to other races/ethnicities (Fig. 3A,B).

Comparison of the prevalence of anemia in the REDS-II
blood donor and NHANES 2005­2008 data sets
The prevalence of anemia for the two data sets was
determined using cutoff values of 13.5 g/dL for men (Fig.
4A) and 12.0 g/dL for women (Fig. 4B). In men, there is an
approximately 50% lower prevalence of anemia in REDS-II
subjects than in NHANES subjects in most races/ethnicities
(e.g., 2.8 vs. 5.1% in Whites and 1.5 vs. 2.9% in Hispanics)
except that Black REDS-II men have a much lower preva-
lence of anemia than Black NHANES men (4.0 vs. 14.7%).
A similar pattern is seen for women, namely a 50% lower
prevalence in most races/ethnicities (e.g., 3.2 vs. 5.6% in
Whites and 6.2 vs. 10.4% in Hispanics) but a much lower
anemia prevalence among Black REDS-II women com-
pared to Black NHANES women (10.0 vs. 23.3%).
Discussion
This study has demonstrated that fingerstick hemoglobin
and hematocrit values obtained when screening first-time
blood donors for anemia give a generally accurate repre-
sentation of the US population hemoglobin values obtained
from NHANES studies. As hemoglobin measurements
obtained at blood centers are increasingly becoming avail-
able through electronic databases, these data represent a
pre-existing and economical resource that is currently
underutilized for public health assessment of hemoglobin
and the prevalence of anemia in the United States.
Although the majority of blood donors are white individuals
between 30 and 60 years old [16], there are considerable
numbers of minority as well as younger and older blood
donors [16]. Thus, it would be possible to statistically adjust
for under representation of different demographic groups
and obtain a nationally representative sample of community
dwelling people in United States.
To standardize for differences in demographic variables,
it was necessary to adjust for imbalances in age, sex, and
race/ethnicity between blood donors and the general US
population. It was also necessary to convert fingerstick
hemoglobin measurement to that of venous blood [17]. We
were able to use data from concurrent fingerstick and
venous measurements obtained from blood donors enrolled
in the RISE study to obtain adjustment factors [15]. Our
analysis also revealed center-to-center variability in finger-
stick hemoglobin measurement that was relatively modest
in scale, but nevertheless will be important to quantify in
future studies. The source of such variability is likely owing
to different point-of-care devices, differences in fingerstick
blood sampling technique, training of operational staff and/
or geographical variation in hemoglobin [18]. As quantita-
tive hemoglobin measurement by fingerstick sampling
becomes more widespread among blood centers, it is likely
that operational research and quality control measures can
be implemented to limit the effect of such variability [19].
Despite demographic stratification and other statistical
adjustment of the data sets, blood donor and NHANES
data diverged among certain subgroups. First, the mean
hemoglobin values for men were slightly lower in blood

donors than in NHANES. This may have resulted from
the lack of adjustment for smoking in the REDS-II donor
database as male blood donors likely have lower smoking
intensity than the male NHANES subjects. In our smaller
RISE-NHANES comparison that did include donor smoking
information, we found that cigarette smoking can raise he-
moglobin levels by 0.26­0.59 g/dL depending on smoking
intensity, values that are similar to those previously
reported (0.4 g/dL) [20]. In the future, it may be possible to
impute smoking status from population surveys or to collect
smoking status as a routine variable on blood donors,
which would also be of use for cardiovascular risk screen-
ing that is often provided by blood centers to donors
[21,22].
The hemoglobin differences between Blacks and other
races/ethnicities were also smaller in blood donors than in
their NHANES counterparts. Lower hemoglobin values in
Blacks are well described and persist at various degrees of
iron deficiency and following correction for disease status
and behavioral risk factors [23,24]. As minorities are under-
represented among blood donors, [16] positive selection for
healthy individuals among Black first-time blood donors
compared to the general population could explain the rea-
son why racial differences in hemoglobin are muted among
blood donors. Further research to determine why this differ-
ence is smaller in blood donors than in the general popula-
tion may help to further understand the genetic and physio-
logical factors underlying the differences in hemoglobin
values among races/ethnicities [25].
Although there is good agreement of mean hemoglobin
values between REDS-II blood donor and NHANES data
sets among different demographic groups (Figs. 2 and 3),
there were more evident differences in the prevalence of
anemia in Black men and women between the two data
sets (Fig. 4). This is because anemia, by definition, focuses
on the leftward tail of the distributions shown in Fig. 1
where differences between the REDS-II and the NHANES
curves are more accentuated. As noted above, possible
reasons for these discrepancies include selection for
healthier minority persons as blood donors, lack of adjust-
ment for smoking and perhaps failure of our fingerstick-to-
venous conversion algorithm to account for race/ethnicity.
Future research can be directed at understanding these
issues. Nevertheless, changes in anemia prevalence over
time should still be evident in the blood donor sample,
allowing the identification of trends relevant to public health.
Strengths of this study include its large size owing to the
inclusion of electronically recorded, routine hemoglobin and
hematocrit values from four blood centers in the REDS-II
blood donor database. Data were collected within a Food
and Drug Administration regulated environment, with atten-
tion to quality control. Race and ethnicity information was
available from all of the blood donors participating in the
REDS-II research study. Although this may not be the case
for all blood centers nationwide, increased collection of
these data are likely to occur at blood centers in the future,
particularly if new donor demographic-based blood donation
intervals are developed. Finally, the availability of pre-exist-
ing data allowed a low-cost analysis, important if such an
approach is to be considered for routine public health moni-
toring.
Weaknesses of the study include the potential for selec-
tion bias inherent in the utilization of a blood donor popula-
tion that are self-selected ``healthy'' individuals and
screened for behavioral practices to remove those at high
risk for HIV or hepatitis infection. This ``healthy donor effect''
is analogous to the ``healthy worker effect'' well known in
the occupational health literature [26,27]. Sources of such
bias may include deferral of the prospective blood donor by
the blood center, self-deferral of the donor for perceived ill
health prior to presentation at the blood center, and socioe-
conomic and behavioral factors associated with the dona-
tion. Blood donors are also better educated than the gen-
eral population, but educational status has little impact on
blood donor hemoglobin values in the United States
[23,24,28]. We believe that our statistical adjustments have
minimized the effects of selection bias, but its effects need
to be better understood. Another weakness is that the four
centers where the study was conducted are in the North-
east and Midwest and, therefore, the study sample lacks
populations of donors that may be of particular interest in
the study of hemoglobin values, such as those that live at
high altitude. Finally, although we developed a correction
factor for fingerstick vs. venous hemoglobin levels, mea-
surement error attributable to the point-of-care devices and
center-to-center variability needs to be better quantified.
Despite these limitations, hemoglobin measurement in
blood donors represents a large scale and continuous sam-
pling of the US population. It will allow for the identification
and tracking of population subgroups (age, sex, and race/
ethnicity groups) with increased risk for anemia. Ongoing
as opposed to episodic measurement will allow for the
assessment of response to public health interventions such
as changes in iron and folate supplements to food [29]. In
addition, continuous tracking of blood donor hemoglobin
data may be useful in monitoring the unexplained decline in
anemia identified in women through the study of NHANES
data between 1988 and 2002 [5]. As anemia is an inde-
pendent indicator of poor outcomes in the elderly, blood
donor data may also prove valuable to track trends in the
prevalence of anemia in the elderly as the baby boomer
population becomes senior citizens [4].

The availability of hemoglobin data as well as other
health screening tests such as cholesterol and hemoglobin
A1c is consistent with the concept of the blood center as a
health-screening resource for the community [21]. Conceiv-
ably, large-scale blood center data could be used to study
the effects of altitude and other environmental influences
on hemoglobin levels and other health parameters [30]. In
addition, the robustness of the data may allow for improved
assessment of current diagnostic values for anemia in spe-
cific demographic subgroups [31].
The growing availability of large databases of fingerstick
hemoglobin has also implications for the management of
donors by blood centers. First, blood collection itself clearly
has an impact on hemoglobin balance, as demonstrated in
the shift toward lower mean hemoglobin among frequent
female blood donors shown in Fig. 1B. Analyses of trends
in hemoglobin data in repeat donors over time may allow
better management for blood collection to prevent iron
deficiency [32,33]. The RISE cohort study from which our
venous hemoglobin data were derived is attempting to cor-
relate hemoglobin levels with iron status and the ability of
donors to meet the current donation criteria of hemoglobin
12.5 g/dL. Once this relationship is understood by more
intensive measurements on a subset of donors, broader
scale monitoring of small changes in hemoglobin levels
over time could allow the assessment of minimum hemo-
globin cutoffs or recommendation of blood donation inter-
vals based on the hemoglobin patterns in different blood
donor populations.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the feasibility of uti-
lizing fingerstick hemoglobin and hematocrit measurements
on first-time blood donors to approximate hemoglobin levels
in the general US population. We have identified specific
areas of potential bias and measurement error that are
amenable to further research and correction by better qual-
ity control of the fingerstick hemoglobin measurement
within the blood center. Nevertheless, we believe these cur-
rently existing data that are available at very low cost will
be useful for public health surveillance of anemia, within
specific demographic subgroups of the population. Blood
centers may also be able to use similar hemoglobin
analyses on a real-time basis for better prevention of iron
deficiency anemia among frequent blood donors and for
incorporation into donor health-screening strategies while
serving as an incentive to retain blood donor participation.
