Background: The authors examined recent changes in
the number and proportion of patients prescribed anti-
depressants by psychiatrists in outpatient private prac-
tice and characterized antidepressant prescription pat-
terns by patient age, sex, race, payment source, and clinical
diagnosis.
Methods: The authors analyzed physician-reported data
from the 1985 and 1993-1994 National Ambulatory Medi-
cal Care Survey, focusing on visits to physicians special-
izing in psychiatry. Logistic regressions were used to ex-
amineassociationsbetweensurveyyearandantidepressant
prescription, adjusting for the presence of other vari-
ables.
Results: The proportion of outpatient psychiatric vis-
its in which an antidepressant was prescribed increased
from 23.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.7%-
26.5%) in 1985 to 48.6% (95% CI, 47.5%-49.7%) in 1993-
1994. After controlling for several patient variables, psy-
chiatric patients were approximately 2.3 (95% CI, 1.8-
2.9)timesmorelikelytoreceiveanantidepressantin 1993-
1994 than in 1985. In 1993-1994, selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors accounted for approximately half of
the psychiatric visits with an antidepressant prescrip-
tion. Increases in the rate of antidepressant prescription
were particularly evident for children and young adults;
whites; new patients; and patients with adjustment dis-
orders, personality disorders, depression not otherwise
specified or dysthymia, and some anxiety disorders.
Conclusions: During the late 1980s and early 1990s,
there was a significant increase in the prescription of
antidepressants by office-based psychiatrists. This in-
crease was greatest for patients with less severe psychi-
atric disorders.

ACCUMULATING evidence
suggests that the use of an-
tidepressant medications is
increasing. A recently pub-
lished household survey of
2 New England communities revealed that
between 1981 and 1993, antidepressant
use increased almost 4-fold.1 In this study,
the growth in antidepressant use was great-
est after fluoxetine hydrochloride first be-
came available in late 1987. Pharmacy pre-
scriptions for antidepressants have
followed a similar pattern: increasing only
modestly during the early 1980s2 and then
increasing more rapidly toward the end of
the decade.3
Research on the prescribing prac-
tices of office-based physicians provides ad-
ditional evidence for the increasing use of
antidepressants. Between 1980 and 1989,
annual prescriptions of antidepressants by
office-based physicians in the United States
increased from 10.0 to 13.2 million.4 The
fastest growth occurred among prescrip-
tions written by psychiatrists.4 In contrast
tothe steadyincrease inantidepressantpre-
scriptions by psychiatrists, prescriptions of
anxiolytic and antipsychotic medications
by psychiatrists did not show consistent
growth during this period.5
In the last few years, several devel-
opments have focused renewed attention
on patterns of antidepressant use. First, the
armamentarium of antidepressant medi-
cations has continued to expand as newer
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) and antidepressants with atypi-
cal mechanisms of action have become
available, beginning with fluoxetine in late
1987. Second, there has been a surge in
public interest in antidepressants. Fluox-
etine and other newer antidepressants have
been the topic of lead articles in national
news magazines,6 best-selling books,7 and
widely watched television talk shows.
Third, drug companies have begun to
market antidepressants and other pre-
scription medications on television and
in the lay press. Fourth, antidepressants
are clinically useful in an expanding
range of psychiatric and general medical
disorders.8 In light of these develop-
ments, we sought to reexamine recent
trends in the prescription of antidepres-
sants by psychiatrists in outpatient
practice. We examine changes in the
demographic, patient payment, and
clinical correlates of antidepressant pre-
scription by psychiatrists in office-based
practice.

RESULTS
VISIT CHARACTERISTICS
Psychiatric visits in the 1993-1994 survey significantly
differed in several respects from visits in the 1985 sur-
vey (Table 1). The 1993-1994 sample included a sig-
nificantly higher proportion of visits by older patients,
nonwhite patients, publicly insured patients, prepaid pa-
tients, and patients who had not been previously seen
by the treating psychiatrist. A relatively larger propor-
tion of psychiatric visits in the 1993-1994 survey than
in the 1985 survey included a diagnosis of a major de-
pressive disorder or a disorder that is usually first evi-
dent in childhood. By contrast, there was a significantly
smaller proportion of visits by self-paying patients and
patients with personality disorders in the 1993-1994 than
in the 1985 survey (Table 1).
OVERALL ANTIDEPRESSANT PRESCRIPTION
Between1985and1993-1994,theestimatednumberofpsy-
chiatricvisitsincludinganantidepressantprescriptionmore
than doubled, from 4.2 million (sample N=643) to 11.0
million (sample N=1546) or from 23.1% (95% CI, 19.7%-
26.5%) to 48.6% (95% CI, 47.5%-49.7%) of psychiatric vis-
its. After controlling for demographic characteristics, ex-
pected payment source, visit status, diagnosis, and number
of psychiatric diagnoses, psychiatric patients in the 1993-
1994 survey were an estimated 2.3 (95% CI, 1.8-2.9) times
more likely to receive an antidepressant prescription than
their counterparts in the 1985 survey.
PRESCRIBING DIFFERENCES
BY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP
The increase in antidepressant prescriptions was particu-
larly pronounced among visits by younger patients
(Table 2). Patients who were younger than 18 years were
approximately 6.1 (95% CI, 1.4-27.6) times more likely to
beprescribedanantidepressantin1993-1994thanin1985,
controllingforsex,race,expectedpaymentsource,visitsta-
tus, diagnosis, and number of diagnoses (Table 2). In the
1993-1994 survey, a depressive disorder was diagnosed in
more than half (58.7%) of the children (0-17 years of age)
whose visits included an antidepressant prescription.
SAMPLE, DEFINITIONS,
AND METHODS
SOURCE OF DATA
The source of data for this report is the National Ambula-
tory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS).9 The NAMCS, which
is conducted annually by the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics (NCHS), samples a nationally representative group of
visits to physicians in office-based practice. The present re-
portisbasedonresultsfromthe1985and1993-1994NAMCS.
Approximately 75 000 visits were sampled in the 1985
survey, 36 000 in the 1993 survey, and 34 000 in the 1994
survey. Following NCHS recommendations, data from the
1993 and 1994 surveys were combined to establish a larger
base on which to derive annual estimates.
Attending physicians or their office staff completed a
1-page data form for each visit during a specified 1-week
period. The form contains items such as the patient's age,
sex, race, payment sources, diagnoses, and medications, in-
cluding new prescriptions (ordered, supplied, or admin-
istered) and continuing medications (with or without new
orders).
SURVEY DESIGN
The surveys were conducted via a 3-stage sampling
design. First, a probability sample of 112 primary sam-
pling units (a county, a group of adjacent counties, or a
standard metropolitan statistical area) was drawn, next a
probability sample was drawn of practicing physicians
within these primary sampling units, and finally a system-
atic random sample was drawn of the visits to these physi-
cians. Physicians expecting more than 10 visits per day
recorded visits based on a predetermined sampling inter-
val. Some patient duplication may occur with this survey
design.
SAMPLE OF PHYSICIANS
The current analysis is confined to visits to psychiatrists. Psy-
chiatrists include physicians specializing in general psychia-
try or a psychiatric subspecialty such as child psychiatry or
psychoanalysis. The 1985 NAMCS surveyed 178 psychia-
trists and the 1993-1994 NAMCS surveyed 257 psychia-
trists. The response rate was 74% in 1985 and 70% in 1993-
1994. Although the number of psychiatric visits is greater in
the 1993-1994 survey (n=3164) than in the 1985 survey
(n=2703), the sampling weights described below adjust for
these differences to yield unbiased national estimates.
VARIABLE DEFINITIONS
Antidepressants
Antidepressant drugs included tricyclic and tetracyclic an-
tidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, atypical an-
tidepressants (bupropion hydrochloride, trazodone hydro-
chloride, venlafaxine hydrochloride, and nefazodone
hydrochloride), and the SSRIs fluoxetine, sertraline hy-
drochloride, and paroxetine hydrochloride. None of the
SSRIs were licensed for use at the time of the 1985 survey.
Demographic Characteristics
Data were collected on patient age, sex, and race as re-
ported by the physician.
Source of Payment
Data were also collected on the sources and arrangements
used to pay for the index visit: private insurance, public
insurance (Medicare or Medicaid), self-pay, prepaid plans,
and a residual category that includes no charge and other
sources. Prepaid plans included health maintenance orga-
nizations, independent practice associations, preferred

After controlling for the confounding effects of other
demographic and clinical factors, male patients were 2.9
(95% CI, 1.9-4.4) times more likely and female patients
were 2.2 (95% CI, 1.6-3.0) times more likely to be pre-
scribed antidepressants in the 1993-1994 than in the 1985
survey (Table 2). Similarly, white patients were 2.6 (95%
CI, 2.0-3.4) times more likely to be prescribed an antide-
pressant in 1993-1994 than in 1985. However, psychiat-
ric visits by nonwhite patients were not significantly more
likelytoincludeanantidepressantprescriptioninthe1993-
1994 than in the 1985 survey (Table 2).
PRESCRIBING DIFFERENCES BY EXPECTED
SOURCE OF PAYMENT
All of the patient payment groups experienced signifi-
cant increases in the rate of antidepressant prescription
between the 2 surveys. These increases remained signifi-
cant after adjustment for the confounding effects of de-
mographic, payment, visit status, and diagnostic vari-
ables (Table 2). The largest increases in the rate of
antidepressant prescription occurred among prepaid pa-
tients and patients in the residual "other" payment cat-
egory.
PRESCRIBING DIFFERENCES BY VISIT STATUS
The rate of antidepressant prescription significantly in-
creased between the 1985 and 1993-1994 surveys for pa-
tients who were new to the treating psychiatrist and for
patients who had been seen previously (Table 2).
PRESCRIBING DIFFERENCES
BY DIAGNOSTIC GROUP
Significant increases in the rate of antidepressant pre-
scription were observed for several diagnostic groups
(Table 3). There was a significant increase in the un-
adjusted rate of antidepressant prescriptions for pa-
tients with generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, other anxiety disorders, personality
disorders, childhood disorders and mental retardation,
substance use disorders, adjustment disorders, and de-
pressive disorders other than major depressive disorder
provider organizations, and other prepaid arrangements.
The payment categories are not mutually exclusive.
Diagnosis
Some of the analyses involve aggregating visits into broad
categories by first-, second-, or third-listed diagnosis. These
groups, according to International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, include major
depressive disorder (296.2 and 296.3), other depressive dis-
orders (300.4 and 311), panic disorder (300.01), general-
ized anxiety disorder (300.02), obsessive-compulsive dis-
order (300.3), other anxiety disorders (300.0-300.2 [except
300.01-300.02], 300.5-300.9, and 309.8), adjustment dis-
orders (308 and 309 [except 309.8]), bipolar disorder
(296.0, 296.1, and 296.4-296.9), schizophrenia and re-
lated disorders (295, 297-299, and 780.1), personality dis-
order (301), disorders of childhood and mental retarda-
tion (312-319 and 995.5), substance abuse disorders (291,
292, 303-305, 327, and 328), and other mental disorders
(290, 293, 294, 301, 302, 306, 307, and 310). Because of
codiagnosis, these groups are not mutually exclusive.
Visit Status
The surveys include a visit status variable that classifies pa-
tients according to whether the physician (or another phy-
sician in the same office) had ever seen the patient before.
ANALYSIS PLAN
We began by examining the demographic and diagnostic
composition of psychiatric visits in the 2 survey periods.
We then examined the rate per 100 psychiatric visits of an-
tidepressant prescriptions in each survey period. To ad-
just for secular change in patient characteristics, we com-
bined the 1985 and 1993-1994 surveys and used a logistic
regression to evaluate the association between survey year
and antidepressant prescription, controlling for patient age,
sex, race, payment source, visit status, diagnostic group,
and number of psychiatric diagnoses.
The rate of antidepressant prescription in each sur-
vey period was determined stratified by demographic group,
payment source, visit, diagnostic group, and number of di-
agnoses. Logistic regressions were used to estimate rates
of antidepressant prescription adjusted for the various de-
mographic and clinical covariates.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Becausethevisitsamplingisnotentirelyrandom,theNCHS
weights each visit to inflate the sample and correct for sam-
pling imperfections. Census population estimates are used
to compute the annual visit rate. Reported percentages are
basedontheweightedestimates.Estimatesforthe1993-1994
period represent the annualized mean of the 2 survey years.
The construction of weights has 3 components: (1) in-
flation by reciprocals of sampling probabilities, (2) adjust-
ment for nonresponse, and (3) a ratio adjustment to fixed to-
tals. The adjustment for nonresponse replaces patient visits
tononrespondentswithvisitstorespondentsinthesamespe-
cialty and same primary sampling unit. The ratio adjust-
ment involves multiplying each visit by the ratio of physi-
cians listed in the American Medical Association­American
Osteopathic Association master files for a given specialty over
the number of sampled physicians in that specialty.
The NCHS provides formulas for the 1985 and 1993-
1994 NAMCSs to calculate SEs of the survey estimates. These
formulas were used to compute 95% CIs around the sur-
vey estimates. In consultation with the NCHS, a statistical
adjustment was used to prepare the data for the logistic re-
gressions. This adjustment involves reducing the effective
sample size of the survey to simulate sampling from a simple
random sample. The weights were multiplied by an adjust-
ment factor calculated by dividing the sum of poststratifi-
cation weights by the sum of the squared poststratifica-
tion weights.10 This procedure yields conservative estimates
that tend to overcompensate for stratification artifacts.11

(Table 3). For adjustment disorders, personality disor-
ders, and the other anxiety and depressive disorders cat-
egories, these increases remained significant after con-
trolling within and across survey year for the confounding
effects of demographic variables, expected payment
source, and other clinical factors (Table 3).
ANTIDEPRESSANT SELECTION
In the 1993-1994 survey, psychiatric patients with anti-
depressant medication mentions were nearly evenly di-
vided between those who did (49.8%) and did not (50.2%)
receive an SSRI. The most commonly prescribed antide-
pressants in the 1993-1994 survey were fluoxetine
(27.0%), sertraline (17.2%), paroxetine (9.8%), traz-
odone (9.4%), and nortriptyline hydrochloride (7.0%).
Patients whose first-listed diagnosis was a less se-
vere disorder (ie, an adjustment disorder, a depressive
disorder other than major depressive disorder, or an "other
mental disorder") were significantly more likely to re-
ceive an SSRI (56.7%) than a non-SSRI (43.3%) antide-
pressant (2=8.9, df=1, P=.003).
COMMENT
Between 1985 and 1993-1994, the proportion of office-
based psychiatric visits that included an antidepressant
prescription more than doubled. This increase devel-
oped at a time when other important changes were also
occurring in the composition of office-based psychiatric
practice. In line with broader demographic trends,12 there
was an increase in the proportion of psychiatric visits by
older patients and racial minorities. Psychiatric practice
also became more dependent on public sources of reim-
bursement and prepaid arrangements.13 Shorter epi-
sodes of outpatient psychiatric care14 resulted in propor-
tionately more visits by patients who had not been
previously seen by the treating psychiatrist.
Between the surveys, there were also significant
changes in the recorded clinical diagnoses. In 1993-

1994, psychiatrists diagnosed a proportionately larger
number of their patients as having major depressive dis-
order or a disorder that is usually first evident in child-
hood and a smaller number as having personality disor-
ders. Without an independent, objective assessment, it
is not possible to determine the sources of these changes.
One possibility is that shifts in the clinical diagnostic pro-
file reflect true secular change in the treated prevalence
of these disorders. It is also possible that the release of
DSM-III-R (1987)15 contributed to an increase in the di-
agnosis of some disorders.16 A third possibility is that the
availability of newer antidepressants with fewer adverse

effects tipped diagnostic practices in favor of major de-
pressive disorder and away from personality disorders.
There is a close connection between some depressive states
and personality disorder17,18 that is reflected in the in-
clusion of "depressive personality disorder" in the ap-
pendix of DSM-IV19 as a proposed category requiring fur-
ther study. In evaluating antidepressant prescribing
differences between the 2 surveys, it is important to bear
in mind these differences between the 2 samples.
One of the most dramatic increases in antidepres-
sant prescription occurred among children and adoles-
cents. Approximately 3 of every 10 child or adolescent
psychiatric visits in the 1993-1994 survey included an
antidepressant prescription. A depressive disorder was
diagnosed in 59% of these visits.
The widespread prescription of antidepressants to
children and adolescents is a relatively new phenom-
enon. Earlier research indicates a much lower rate of an-
tidepressant prescription.20,21 For example, Kaplan and
coworkers20 found that only 4.2% of children seen at a
university-based child psychiatric clinic during 1989 were
prescribed an antidepressant. A recently published sur-
vey revealed that the average British child psychiatrist
starts antidepressant therapy in only 1 or 2 children each
year.21
Evidence for the efficacy of antidepressant therapy
in childhood and adolescent major depressive disorder
is uneven.22,23 Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies
examining the treatment of adolescents with major de-
pressive disorder indicate no or only limited benefits from
antidepressant therapy.24-28 Moreover, a recent meta-
analysis uncovered serious methodological flaws in pub-
lished studies of antidepressant use among children and
adolescents.29 Given the apparent gap between current
treatment practices and existing empirical evidence, con-
tinued research on the efficacy and effectiveness of an-
tidepressants in the treatment of psychiatric disorders in
children and adolescents remains a high priority.
Antidepressant prescription has also markedly in-
creased to psychiatric patients with less severe disor-
ders. A significant increase in the antidepressant pre-
scription rate was observed for patients diagnosed as
having adjustment disorders and less severe anxiety dis-
orders. The frequent prescription of SSRIs to patients with
less severe disorders suggests that the introduction of
medications with fewer adverse effects has lowered the
threshold for antidepressant prescribing.
Considerable public and professional controversy
surrounds the use of antidepressants in the treatment of
such minor conditions.30-32 There is a concern that anti-
depressants are being used to treat conditions that might
respond to simple supportive psychological interven-
tions alone. Although antidepressants have been shown
to be effective in mild forms of major depression,33,34 their
proper role in the treatment of less consequential syn-
dromes is less clear. In evaluating the reported use of an-
tidepressants in patients with minor psychiatric condi-
tions, it is important to consider the following possibilities:
deliberate undercoding of depressive disorders to re-
duce stigma or future insurance eligibility35; appropri-
ate prescription of antidepressants to treat general medi-
cal problems (eg, headache, peripheral neuropathy, and
gastritis); the use of sedating antidepressants as hypnot-
ics; and the poor specificity of the diagnostic categories
(eg, depression not otherwise specified vs adjustment dis-
order with depressed mood).
THERE IS substantialevidencesupportingthe
role of antidepressants in the treatment of
panic disorder,36,37 obsessive-compulsive
disorder,38 some personality disorders,39
and enuresis.40 There is also some evi-
dence that antidepressants may be useful in the treat-
ment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder41 and de-
pressed adult patients with alcohol use disorders42 and
in the maintenance of alcohol43 and cocaine44 absti-
nence. For these conditions, the recent increases in an-
tidepressant prescription may represent a response to pub-
lished experimental clinical data.
Psychiatric patients diagnosed as having major de-
pressive disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder did
not experience a significant increase in the rate of anti-
depressant treatment. Although antidepressants are ef-
fective in treating patients with major depressive disor-
der and certain phases or subtypes of schizophrenia45,46
and bipolar disorder,47 the availability of newer agents
with fewer adverse effects did not significantly increase
antidepressant treatment of patients with these more se-
vere disorders. The pharmacological advantages of the
newer antidepressants may tend to exert a greater effect
in treatment decisions for patients with less severe psy-
chopathologic disorders. The more favorable adverse ef-
fect profile and the greater safety of SSRIs when taken in
overdose may also help to explain why psychiatrists have
become more willing to prescribe antidepressants to out-
patients during their initial office visits.
Comparing across payment sources, prepaid insur-
ance was associated with higher use of antidepressants.
Compared with psychiatrists in fee-for-service practice,
those in prepaid settings may be selectively referred
cases for medication management or may tend to first
see patients later in the course of illness,48 when symp-
toms are more severe and a greater use of antidepres-
sants is clinically indicated. In addition, many prepaid
health plans limit psychiatrists' practices to medication
management.
In the present study, nonwhite psychiatric patients
did not have a significant increase in antidepressant pre-
scriptions. Several other investigators have reported a rela-
tively low rate of antidepressant prescription in black pa-
tients.49,50 In 1 study, the pairing of black patients and
white clinicians was associated with a lower antidepres-
sant treatment rate than the pairing of black patients and
black clinicians.51 The possibility that racial factors af-
fect antidepressant prescribing requires further investi-
gation. It is possible that patient and provider attitudi-
nal factors mediate the observed racial disparity in
antidepressant use.
The NAMCS is limited in many ways. It does not
provide critical information about the duration or dos-
age of the antidepressant medication trials, the specific
condition for which the medication is prescribed, or treat-
ment response. Another limitation is the uncertain reli-

ability of diagnoses established by practicing physi-
cians. It is possible, for example, that the observed increase
in antidepressant prescription is a response to a secular
increase in illness severity within diagnostic groups. There
is also no information on the large number of psychia-
trists who work outside of office-based practice set-
tings.52 Despite these significant limitations, the NAMCS
provides the only currently available source of nation-
ally representative data concerning the prescribing prac-
tices of physicians in office-based practice.
In less than a decade, the proportion of psychiatric
outpatient visits that include an antidepressant prescrip-
tion approximately doubled so that by 1993-1994 nearly
half of all such visits included an antidepressant pre-
scription. Although some of this increase seems to be an
appropriate response to the availability of safer agents
combined with the results of well-controlled research,
some of the increase may be based on less secure evi-
dence.
