BACKGROUND: Little data has been published on the association of indices of body fat distribution and HDL
cholesterol (HDL), a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity, in representative samples of total populations of children
and adolescents including blacks and Hispanics.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the distribution of waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in US children and adolescents and to assess the
association with HDL.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of a large national sample, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey.
PARTICIPANTS: People aged 4 ± 19 y.
MEASUREMENTS: Body circumferences, skinfold thickness, body mass index (BMI), and serum total and HDL
cholesterol concentrations.
RESULTS: Mean WHR varied consistently with age, gender, and ethnic group. Levels were highest in Mexican
Americans. WHR showed signi®cant negative associations with HDL cholesterol concentration and positive associa-
tions with the ratio of total serum cholesterol to HDL in pre- and postpubertal girls independent of age and BMI.
However, associations were often not as strong as those with BMI. Other indices of body fat distribution were not
superior to WHR.
CONCLUSION: Further research is needed on the association of WHR, other indices of body fat distribution and HDL
measured in childhood with subsequent risk of atherosclerosis.
Keywords: lipoprotein, high density; adolescence; child; sex factors; blacks; Hispanics
Introduction
Several studies have examined the relationship of
indices of body fat distribution and cardiovascular
risk factors in representative national samples of US
children and adolescents.1 ± 6 Associations of body
circumference measures and skinfold measures of fat
distribution and fatness were found with blood pres-
sure,1,6 serum uric acid,1,5 and to a lesser extent,
serum total cholesterol.2,6 However these surveys
did not include data on important risk factors such
as HDL cholesterol. Furthermore, thigh circumference
was not measured so that only waist-to-hip but not
waist-to-thigh ratio was examined. Published studies
of indices of body fat distribution and HDL choles-
terol in children have been mostly in small samples of
obese children. While generally showing some sig-
ni®cant associations, they yielded con¯icting results
regarding variation of the association by age, gender,
ethnicity and sexual maturity.7,8 Since adverse pat-
terns of blood lipids and atherosclerosis itself begin in
childhood, studies of population and individual differ-
ences in the early onset and progression through
adolescence of risk factors are important.9 Tracking
of blood lipids, obesity, and body fat distribution over
long periods has been demonstrated.1,2,10 ± 12 In order
to test the hypothesis that circumference and skinfold
indices of body fat distribution are signi®cantly asso-
ciated with HDL cholesterol and the ratio of total
serum cholesterol to HDL cholesterol independent of
overall fatness, gender, ethnicity, age or maturity
level, data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) were
examined.

Methods
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) was conducted in 1988 ± 1994
on a nationwide multi-stage probability sample of
approximately 40 000 people from the civilian, non-
institutionalized population aged two months and over
of the United States excluding reservation lands of
American Indians. Of these, 31 311 were examined.
The descriptive analyses of body fat distribution in
this report are restricted to 7 987 children and young
adults aged 4 ± 19 y examined with valid circumfer-
ence measurements in the survey. This analysis
sample included 2 862 non-Hispanic blacks, 2 192
non-Hispanic whites and 2 933 Mexican Americans.
Numbers of people in various correlation and regres-
sion analyses that follow vary due to differing num-
bers with missing values on selected variables. Details
of the plan, sampling, operation and response have
been published as have procedures used to obtain
informed consent and to maintain con®dentiality of
information obtained.13
Demographic, medical history, and behavioral
information were collected prior to the examination
by household interview of the parents or guardians of
children and of adolescents and young adult partici-
pants aged 12 y and over. Examinations were carried
out in a mobile examination center. For children aged
8 ± 18 y, the physician assessed sexual development
by inspection as follows: pubic hair (male and
female), genitalia (male), breast (grade of least devel-
oped breast, female). Stages were 1 for least devel-
oped through to 5 for fully developed as described
elsewhere.14
Blood samples were obtained at the examination
center. Fasting was not required of children prior to
examination. Blood in a red-top Vacutainer tube was
allowed to stand for 45 min at room temperature to
allow complete clotting and clot retraction. Samples
were centrifuged at 1500Âg for 30 min at 4C. Sam-
ples were frozen at 7 20C and shipped on dry ice to
the Johns Hopkins University Lipoprotein Analytic
Laboratory, Baltimore, Maryland. Serum total choles-
terol (TC) determinations were measured enzymati-
cally and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL) was measured in serum following the precipi-
tation of other lipoproteins with a polyanionadivalent
cation mixture (Hitachi 704 AnalyzeraBoehringer-
Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).15 ± 17
Serum cholesterol concentration is 3 ± 5% higher
than in EDTA plasma, but no signi®cant serum-
plasma difference was observed for HDL cholesterol.
The ratio of TCaHDL was computed. The extensive
quality control procedures followed are detailed else-
where.15 Analyses of associations of HDL with other
variables were restricted to the 1 894 non-Hispanic
whites, 2 432 non-Hispanic blacks, and 2 609 Mexican
Americans with valid data for both HDL and body
circumferences.
Technicians measured height to the nearest 0.1 cm,
weight to the nearest 0.01 kg, triceps, subscapular,
suprailiac and mid-thigh skinfold thickness to the
nearest 0.1 mm and waist and buttocks circumference
to the nearest 0.1 centimeter as described in detail
elsewhere).13,18,19 With the subject standing at mini-
mal respiration, waist circumference was measured in
a horizontal plane at the level of the high point of the
iliac crest to the nearest 0.1 cm. This method was
chosen after consultation with experts in the ®eld to
maximize reproducibility. Hip circumference was
measured in a horizontal plane at the maximum
extension of the buttocks. Thigh circumference was
measured at midthigh in a plane perpendicular to the
long axis of the thigh. The following were computed:
waist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR), waist-to-
thigh circumference ratio (WTR), ratio of subscapular
to triceps skinfold thickness (SFR), central-peripheral
skinfold ratio (CPR  (subscapular skinfold  sup-
railiac skinfold)a(triceps skinfold  thigh skinfold);
sum of the four skinfolds (SSF); and body mass
index (BMI  weightaheight2, kgam2). Extensive
descriptive data on height, weight, BMI and obesity
prevalence as well as serum lipids in the NHANES III
population are being published elsewhere and will not
be duplicated here.17,19
Statistical analysis
The plan of the present analyses was as follows.
Detailed descriptive statistics and measures of asso-
ciation were computed initially using unweighted data
using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS).20 ± 22
Pearson partial correlation was used to assess the
association of HDL cholesterol (HDL), total serum
cholesterol (TC) and the ratio TCaHDL with other
variables controlling for age.22 Correlation analysis
results are presented because of their familiarity, ease
of interpretation by a wide audience, and use in
previous reports that may be compared to the present
one. Linear multivariate regression analysis was used
to develop models for predicting HDL for each age,
sex, ethnicity group.21 Only variables with prespeci-
®ed hypotheses were entered into the regression
models. Following these preliminary analyses, ®nd-
ings of the unweighted analyses were con®rmed using
techniques that incorporated sampling weights and
design features of the survey.23 Population estimates
for means and percentiles of WHR were produced
using SUDAAN procedures.24 Pearson correlations of
HDL with other variables were con®rmed by SAS
weighted analysis, and statistical testing and variance
estimation were performed using the PROC
REGRESS procedure for linear regression models in
the SUDAAN system.22 ± 24

with increasing age from 4 ± 5 y to 12 ± 15 y, with only
slight additional changes at 16 ± 19 y. At each age
after 4 ± 5 y, WHR was higher in boys than girls. In
boys, mean WHR was highest in Mexican Americans
and only slightly lower in non-Hispanic whites, both
of which were higher than non-Hispanic blacks. For
example, at 6 ± 11 y, means were Mexican Americans
0.91 (SE 0.004), non-Hispanic whites 0.89 (SE 0.003),
non-Hispanic blacks 0.86 (SE 0.002). In girls and
young women, mean WHR was slightly higher in
Mexican Americans than in other groups. The dis-
tribution became increasingly skewed toward higher
values in adolescents, particularly at 16 ± 19 y in
females (Figure 2): the 90th percentile was 0.91 in
non-Hispanic whites, 0.93 in non-Hispanic blacks,
and 0.95 in Mexican Americans.
Descriptive analyses of WTR revealed variation
with age, sex, and ethnicity similar to that described

CPR increased with age, especially in boys (not
shown). The distributions became increasingly
skewed towards higher values in adolescent and
young adult males.
Tables 1 and 2 show weighted partial correlation
coef®cients controlling for age (months) of the four
indices of body fat distribution with HDL, TC and
TCaHDL. In non-Hispanic white boys, correlations of
WHR and other indices with HDL were negative and
generally largest at 6 ± 11 and 12 ± 15 y (Table 1). In
non-Hispanic black boys, a similar pattern was seen
with largest coef®cients generally at 12 ± 15 y. In
Mexican American boys, negative coef®cients were
seen above 4 ± 5 y. Positive coef®cients for TC and
TCaHDL tended to be largest at 12 ± 15 or 16 ± 19 y
and tended to be larger than for other groups.
In non-Hispanic white girls, negative coef®cients
with HDL were generally larger below 16 y and
generally larger than those seen in boys. However,
in non-Hispanic black girls, coef®cients were gener-
ally much smaller than in non-Hispanic white girls
except at 6 ± 11 y. Coef®cients were largest at age
12 ± 15 y in Mexican American girls. Positive coef®-
cients for TCaHDL tended to be largest below 16 y in
non-Hispanics.
Tables 3 and 4 show partial correlation coef®cients
(controlling for age) of HDL, TC, and TCaHDL with
measures of overall fatness or size (waist circumfer-
ence, hip circumference, SSF, BMI). In non-Hispanic
white and black boys, these measures showed nega-
tive correlations with HDL that were generally larger
than those shown for fat distribution indices at 12 ±
15 y but were negligible at 4 ± 5 y. In Mexican

American boys, the negative coef®cients were larger
than those for fat distribution indices above 4 ± 5 y.
Positive coef®cients with TCaHDL tended to be larger
than for body fat distribution at 16 ± 19 y in non-
Hispanic whites, 6 ± 11 and 12 ± 15 y in non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican Americans.
In non-Hispanic white girls, negative coef®cients
with HDL were consistently larger than those for fat
distribution indices across subgroups. In Mexican
American girls, negative coef®cients were similar in
magnitude to those for body fat distribution indices.
Linear regression models were ®t for each age, sex,
ethnicity group separately with HDL as the dependent
variable and WHR as the exposure variable control-
ling for age and BMI to determine whether body fat
distribution was signi®cantly asociated with HDL
independent of overall fatness. In non-Hispanic
white boys, WHR was not signi®cantly associated
with HDL independent of age and BMI except at
12 ± 15 y, at which age a signi®cant positive interac-
tion of WHR with age was observed in the 12 ± 15 y
age group (P  0.02). BMI was signi®cant at 6 ± 11
and 12 ± 15 y. In non-Hispanic black boys, WHR was
a signi®cant independent correlate at 4 ± 5 y
(beta  38.0, SE 17.9 P  0.04), with non-signi®cant
trends at other ages, for example, 6 ± 11 y beta 733.9,
SE 20.0, P  0.09. A signi®cant interaction of WHR
with BMI was seen at 12 ± 15 y (WHR beta 7310, SE
152, P  0.05, BMI beta 74.2, SE 1.7, P  0.01,
WHRÂBMI beta 4.0, SE 1.8, P  0.03). BMI was
signi®cant correlate of HDL at each age. In Mexican
boys, WHR was a borderline signi®cant correlate of
HDL only at 6 ± 11 y (beta 725.4, SE 13.1,
P  0.059). Signi®cant interaction of WHR with age
(P  0.06) and BMI (P  0.01) occurred at 12 ± 15 y.
BMI was signi®cant at each age except 4 ± 5 y.
In non-Hispanic white girls, WHR was an indepen-
dent negative correlate of HDL at 4 ± 5 y (beta 745.2

non-Hispanic whites 12 ± 15 y (P  0.02), Mexican
American 8 ± 11 y (P  0.02); girls non-Hispanic
whites 8 ± 11 y (P  0.002), non-Hispanic blacks 8 ±
11 y (P  0.006), Mexican American 8 ± 11 y (P 
0.0004), 12 ± 15 y (P  0.04). Signi®cant associations
with BMI were present in most groups. No signi®cant
interactions of WHR with Tanner stage were seen.
Discussion
WHR, WTR, SFR and CPR showed consistent nega-
tive associations with HDL cholesterol levels across
age, gender, and ethnic subgroups in a national sample
of children and young adults aged 4 ± 19 y. These
associations were independent of age. When BMI
was controlled for, WHR remained signi®cantly asso-
ciated with HDL in most female subgroups.
Mechanisms
High density lipoprotein is secreted by the liver and
small intestine as nascent particles which accept
cholesterol from peripheral catabolism of chylomi-
crons and VLDL and from tissues.25 The cholesterol is
returned to the liver (reverse cholesterol transport). Its
major protein is apoA-1. Blood HDL cholesterol level
has been shown to be inversely related to the risk of
coronary heart disease and stroke.26,27 The mechanism
is postulated to be reverse transport of cholesterol
from arteries to the liver, this inhibiting the promotion
of atherosclerosis. It may play an important role in the
initiation of early atherosclerosis in children and
adolescents. Levels of HDL have been noted to
decline during adolescence in males, especially in
whites.28 After early childhood, levels become
higher in females than males and in blacks than
whites.
Obesity and central or abdominal fat distribution
have been associated with decreased levels of HDL in
many studies of adults, and in studies of adoles-
cents.7,8 In adults, abdominal obesity with increased
visceral fat is associated with increased levels of
circulating fatty acids, insulin and insulin resistance,
which lead to increased synthesis of triglycerides and
very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion by the
liver. VLDL are negatively associated with HDL.
Although WHR does not accurately re¯ect intra-
abdominal fat mass in children,29 ± 31, SFR and CPR
surely re¯ect distribution of subcutaneous fat, which
is also related to cardiovascular disease occurrence in
adults.32 ± 34 In a study using computed tomography,
subcutaneous abdominal fat was at least as strong a
correlate of insulin sensitivity as visceral fat, and
retained signi®cance after controlling for visceral
fat.35 Furthermore an android pattern of skinfold
thicknesses was associated with greater absolute and
proportional amounts of visceral adipose tissue than a
gynoid pattern.31 Use of dual-energy X-ray absorptio-
metry for accurate body fat measurement and assess-
ment of regional fat distribution in children might
resolve some of these problems in future studies.36
Visceral abdominal fat measured by MRI was strongly
correlated with HDL cholesterol in 14 obese
(r  7 0.54, P  0.05) and 10 nonobese
(r  7 0.48, P  0.27) girls aged 10 ± 16 y.37 In the
obese girls, subcutaneous abdominal fat and WHR
were not signi®cantly correlated with HDL choles-
terol (r  7 0.23, 0.19, respectively). However,
abdominal subcutaneous fat was correlated with insu-
lin concentration, lending some support to the use of
SFR. Body fat distribution is consistently related to
HDL but not to TC below 16 y. However, at 16 ± 19 y
both WHR and BMI may be correlated with TC but
not HDL, for example in white males and Mexican

females. Several studies have suggested that only
overall fatness but not body fat distribution is an
important correlate of HDL prior to puberty. There-
fore, it has been hypothesized that body fat distribu-
tion becomes an important correlate of blood lipids
only after sexual maturity, while overall obesity may
be more important earlier.6 However NHANES III
data suggest an independent association of WHR with
HDL also in prepubertal girls aged 6 ± 11 y, and even
at 4 ± 5 y in non-Hispanic white girls.
Comparisons with previous reports
Few previous reports assessed the association of WHR
and with HDL cholesterol levels in samples of young
children.7,8,37 ± 42 None were found from large, repre-
sentative population samples. An association of WHR
with HDL cholesterol independent of overall obesity
could not be demonstrated in these small, highly
selected samples.37 ± 42 In 124 Dutch prepubertal chil-
dren, WHR was correlated with HDLaTC (but not
HDL cholesterol) only in girls; controlling for overall
fatness rendered the correlation nonsigni®cant.38 In 74
grossly obese Austrian adolescents aged 10 ± 15 y,
WHR was signi®cantly correlated with HDL only in
boys controlling for age and in neither controlling for
age and BMI.40 In further analyses, HDL-2 was
correlated with WHR in both genders and increased
in graded fashion across WHR tertiles.41 In obese
Japanese children aged 6 ± 12 y, WHR and WTR and
overall obesity were correlated with HDL cholesterol
in boys but not in girls.8 In 57 mostly obese black
children aged 7 ± 11 y, WHR was not associated with a
calculated atherogenic index.42 In a US sample aged
6 ± 18 y selected on the basis of VLDL and LDL
cholesterol levels, HDL seemed more closely related
to waist circumference than femoral skinfold.7 SFR
was not related to HDL in 214 US white adolescents,
but in a small group followed 5 y, change in HDL was
related to the centripetal change in SFR which
occurred in boys only.38 Therefore studies, mostly in
obese subjects, reported signi®cant correlations of
WHR or SFR with HDL, but there was disagreement
as to how these associations varied by sex, and ethnic
group and as to the degree of independence from
overall body fatness. The effect of WHR or SFR in
previous studies was observed chie¯y during and after
puberty. NHANES III data are consistent with nega-
tive associations of abdominal or central obesity and
HDL found during and after puberty but also suggest
independent negative associations of body fat distri-
bution in prebubertal girls.
Limitations
Limitations of this present study include possible bias
arising from survey nonresponse and from missing
values for some variables. Several special studies of
earlier HANES data have indicated little bias due to
nonresponse.23 Adequate reliability has been demon-
strated for HDL cholesterol.15 However the lack of a
single, generally accepted measurement protocol for
body circumference remains a problem for interstudy
comparisons, perhaps explaining in part inconsisten-
cies among studies. Confounding by variables not
controlled for cannot be excluded. No adequate data
on physical activity were available in NHANES III
children. The large sample size in NHANES III
provided good statistical power. Exact P values are
given; furthermore the number of tests was restricted
to those of regression models. Interactions described
above make interpretation of regression models for
some subgroups problematic. The representativeness
of the sample and the use of sample weights provides
wide generalizability of the results to United States
non-Hispanic black and white and Mexican American
children and young adults of the same ages.
Conclusions
Future research should include longitudinal studies of
body fat distribution and HDL in non-Hispanic white
and black and Hispanic children followed to adult-
hood. Body fat distribution and HDL in childhood and
adolescence should be assessed as a risk factor for
future noninvasively measured atherosclerosis, for
example, carotid intima-medial thickness, and the
mechanisms of such an association evaluated.
