Trends in Stroke Prevalence Between 1973 and 1991 in the
US Population 25 to 74 Years of Age
Paul Muntner, PhD; Elizabeth Garrett, PhD; Michael J. Klag, MD, MPH; Josef Coresh, MD, PhD
Background and Purpose--Stroke mortality in the United States has declined since 1900. Primary prevention of stroke
incidence did not decline and may have increased during the 1980s, whereas survival after stroke improved substantially
during the 1970s and 1980s. The effect of these trends on the prevalence and number of stroke survivors in the United
States has not been determined.
Methods--The prevalence and number of noninstitutionalized stroke survivors in the United States was estimated through
self-report for 3 time periods: 1971­1975, 1976­1980, and 1988­1994, using data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) I, II, and III, respectively. Prevalence and number of stroke survivors were
analyzed by age (25 to 59 and 60 to 74 years), race (non-Hispanic whites/Mexican-Americans and non-Hispanic blacks),
and sex. Estimates were limited to the US population ages 25 to 74 years because NHANES I and II did not include
persons older than 75 years.
Results--The age-, race-, and sex-adjusted prevalence of stroke increased from 1.41% to 1.87% from 1971­1975 to
1988­1994, an average increase of 7.5% (95% confidence interval: 2%, 18%) for each 5-year period during this
time. Additionally, during this period, the estimated number of noninstitutionalized stroke survivors increased by
930 000 (95% CI: 300 000 to 1.6 million) from 1.5 million to 2.4 million. Additionally, the average "health in general"
among stroke survivors was similar in all 3 periods.
Conclusions--These data point to the increasing importance of the care and rehabilitation of stroke survivors. (Stroke.

Age-adjusted mortality from stroke in the United States
has declined since the turn of the century, when mor-
tality records started to be kept.1,2 The rate of this decline
accelerated during the 1970s.1,3 Despite the growth and aging
of the US population, there were 145 000 stroke-related
deaths (61 per 100 000 population) in 19894 compared with
207 000 deaths from stroke (106 per 100 000 population) in
1970.4 Over the past decade, several hypotheses for the
accelerated decline in stroke mortality have been proposed.
These include primary prevention and improved stroke sur-
vival.5­12 The incidence of stroke declined during the 1970s
in several population-based studies; however, in these same
populations, stroke incidence did not decline during the
1980s.13­15 Also, data have consistently shown improved
short- and long-term survival after stroke during the 1970s
and 1980s.16­18 Stroke prevalence integrates stroke incidence,
survival, and mortality into a single measure, which is
important for healthcare planning and long-term resource
utilization.
We explored whether a substantial increase in stroke
prevalence (ie, percentage of the population with a history of
stroke at a given time) in the US population occurred during
the 1970s and 1980s. Given the increased size and aging of
the US population, it was hypothesized that the number of
stroke survivors also has increased. These hypotheses were
tested using data from 3 national health surveys.
Methods
First, secular trends in stroke mortality for persons 25 to 74 years of
age were abstracted from the National Center for Health Statistics
Compressed Mortality Files.19 The Compressed Mortality Files
include individual records abstracted from every death certificate for
persons dying within all 50 states and the District of Columbia
except for 1972 where sampling, at a rate of 50%, was performed and
deaths were weighted accordingly. Mortality from stroke was de-
fined by International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 codes
between 430 and 438 listed as the underlying cause or mentioned on
the death certificate.
The prevalence of stroke was estimated using self-report from
6 906, 13 600, and 14 174 interview respondents between 25 and 74
years of age, interviewed in National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Surveys (NHANES) I, II, III, respectively.20 ­22 Each
NHANES survey respondent was asked, "Have you ever been told
by a doctor that you have had a stroke?" Self-reported "health in

general" among stroke survivors was assessed on a nominal scale
(1excellent, 2very good, 3good, 4fair, 5poor). Data for the
3 NHANES surveys were collected from 1971­1975, 1976­1980,
and 1988­1994 (study mid-points 1973, 1978, and 1991), respec-
tively, and used multistage probability sampling designs. Prevalence
and count estimates for each study are averages for the period of time
during which the study was conducted.
Because NHANES is limited to the noninstitutionalized US
population, we used data from the National Hospital Discharge
Survey to assess changes in the number and percentage of patients
with an underlying discharge diagnosis of stroke transferred to a
"long-term care institution." The National Hospital Discharge Sur-
vey is conducted annually and maintains medical and demographic
information from a sample of discharge records selected from a
national sample of non-Federal short-stay hospitals and can be
weighted to estimate inpatient hospital utilization for the United
States.
Statistical Methods
For each time period, the demographic (age [25 to 39, 40 to 49, 50
to 59, and 60 to 74 years], race [black, white, and other], and sex)
composition of the US population was estimated. Additionally, using
NHANES interview response, the prevalence of persons reporting a
history of stroke for each time period was estimated for the overall
noninstitutionalized US population and for each age, race, and sex
subgroup.
Changes in stroke prevalence and number of stroke survivors
across the 3 time periods were assessed using Poisson regression
with parametric bootstrapping techniques to estimate standard errors
(SE).23 Trends in prevalence and number of stroke survivors for the
overall population and race-sex subgroups were regressed on calen-
dar year difference between the NHANES survey midpoints (5 years
between NHANES I and II [1973 and 1978]; 12 years between
NHANES II and III [1978 to 1991]). Calendar years elapsed was
analyzed as a linear variable with estimates expressed for 5-year time
increments. Time elapsed was also modeled using higher order
terms; however, as a result of the potential of overfitting the data,
only the results from the linear models are being presented. Because
of changes in the demographic composition of the US population
occurring between the 3 study periods, the prevalence of stroke was
determined after direct adjustment for age group (25 to 39, 40 to 49,
50 to 59, and 60 to 74 years), race, and sex using the 1973 US
population (NHANES I) as the standard. However, because we were
interested in changes in healthcare burden, direct adjustment was not
used in the analyses investigating changes in the number of stroke
survivors. Because of the low prevalence of stroke in the 25 to 39, 40
to 49, and 50 to 59 year age groups, results for these groups are
presented combined. Mean response for "health in general" among
persons with and without a history of stroke were compared across
time periods. Change in the number and percentage of patients 25 to
74 years of age with an underlying diagnosis of stroke (ICD-9 code
430 to 438) discharged to a long-term care institution were assessed
from 1981 (the initial year for which this data were collected)
through 1994.
Race was recorded differently in the 3 surveys; therefore,
Mexican-Americans were grouped with non-Hispanic whites. Per-
sons of race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, or Mexican-American were excluded from the race-specific
analyses. National estimates for the prevalence and number of stroke
survivors among the noninstitutionalized population of the United
States were derived through the application of sampling weights to
the survey response.24
Results
US Population Characteristics
The number of persons (SE) aged 25 to 74 years in the
noninstitutionalized population of the United States increased
from 106.6 (2.2) million in 1971­1975 to 114.3 (2.3) million
in 1976­1980 and to 146.2 (5.0) million in 1988­1994. The
percentage of the US population that was black or male did
not change substantially. All demographic subgroups, except
persons aged 50 to 59 years, increased in absolute size.
Stroke Mortality
In contrast to the increase in the size of the US population, the
number of stroke deaths among the population aged 25 to 74
years consistently declined between 1971 and 1994 from
81 000 to 44 000, a decrease of 47%. The stroke mortality
rate declined monotonically by more than 50% between 1971
and 1994, from 79 to 29 deaths per 100 000 population.
Stroke Prevalence Rate
Overall, 292, 387, and 324 participants reported a history of
stroke in NHANES I, II, and III, respectively. The prevalence
of stroke in the United States increased between 1973 and
1978 from 1.41% (SE0.2%) to 1.73% (SE0.1%). How-
ever, the prevalence of stroke in the United States in 1991
was not significantly different from the second period (prev-
alence1.70%; SE0.2%; Figure 1). After adjustment for
age, race, and sex, the prevalence of stroke was 1.41
(SE0.2%) in 1973, 1.69 (SE0.2%) in 1978, and 1.87% in
1991; the age-, race-, and sex-adjusted prevalence of stroke
increased by 7.5% (95% CI: 2%, 18%) with every 5-year
period between 1973 and 1991.
Among the population 25 to 59 years old, the prevalence
increased from 0.65% to 0.88% between the first and second
time period and was 0.80% in the third time period (Figure 1).
Neither of the changes between the 2 time periods nor the
trend across the 3 time periods was consistent with a
statistically significant increase or decrease in stroke preva-
lence. The prevalence of stroke among the US population 60
to 74 years old increased from 4.2% to 5.0% to 5.2% during
the period studied (Figure 1). On average, the prevalence of
stroke increased by 6.4% per 5 years (95% CI: 3%, 17%).
Among white males, the age-adjusted prevalence of stroke
increased an average of 12% per 5-year period across the 3
study periods; however, this increase was not statistically
significant (95% CI: 2%, 24%; Table 1). The prevalence
of stroke was similar in each of the 3 study periods among
both white females and black males and increased by 28%
(95% CI: 3%, 56%) for each 5-year period between 1973
and 1991 among black females.

Number of Stroke Survivors
The number of persons in the United States with a history of
stroke increased between the 3 time periods (Figure 2);
overall, there were 1.5, 2.0, and 2.4 million stroke survivors
in 1973, 1978, and 1991, respectively. For each 5-year period
during the study, the number of stroke survivors increased by
286 000 (95% CI: 139 000, 433 000).
Within both age groups examined, the number of persons
reporting a history of stroke increased (Figure 2). The number
(SE) of stroke survivors between 25 and 59 years old
increased from 590 000 (130 000) to 768 000 (101 000) to
965 000 (174 000) between 1973, 1978, and 1991, respec-
tively; on average, the number of younger persons reporting
a history of stroke increased by 115 000 (95% CI: 18 000,
148 000) for each 5-year period. In the 60- to 74-year-old
age group, the number of persons reporting a history of stroke
increased from 917 000 to 1 190 000 to 1 475 000 across the
3 study periods, representing an average increase of
172 000 (95% CI: 41 000, 203 000) stroke survivors
for each 5-year period between the NHANES surveys. Addi-
tionally, the number of stroke survivors increased among
white males and black males and females but not white
females (Table 2).
Self-Reported Health in General
Self-reported "health in general" was worse among those
with a history of stroke compared with those without a history
of stroke for all 3 time periods. However, the average health
was similar at all time periods, among persons with (3.7, 3.9,
3.6) and without (2.5, 2.5, 2.4) a history of stroke.
Hospital Discharge to Long-term Care Facilities
The number of persons 25 to 74 years of age discharged from
hospitals in the United States with an underlying diagnosis of
stroke remained relatively constant between 1981 and 1994;
there were 447 000 and 457 000 patients (both dead and
alive) aged 25 to 74 years discharged from hospitals in the
United States with an underlying diagnosis of stroke in 1981
and 1994, respectively. In contrast, the number and percent-
age of patients aged 25 to 74 years discharged directly to a
long-term care facility increased at a constant rate between
1981 and 1994. In 1981, 6.3% (28 200) of those with a
diagnosis of stroke under age 75 were discharged directly to
a long-term care-facility compared with 8.9% (40 900) pa-
tients of similar age in 1994.
Discussion
Among the US population aged 25 to 74 years, the crude
prevalence of stroke was similar in 1973, 1978, and 1991;
however, after adjustment for age, race, and sex, the preva-
lence of stroke increased from 1.41% to 1.69% to 1.87%
across these time periods. An increase in number of stroke
survivors was observed in all age, race, and sex groups. These
results are concordant with the decrease in stroke mortality
observed in data obtained from the compressed mortality files
and stable stroke incidence observed during the 1980s in
population-based studies.14,15 In sum, these data point to a
decreased stroke case-fatality rate which, if present, clearly
would be a medical triumph.25 However, its consequence, an
increase in stroke survivors potentially living with disabili-
ties, places a burden on the survivor's family, the community,
and the healthcare system,26 which must be recognized.
The current study did not have data to permit the investi-
gation of trends in disability among the stroke survivor
population. Although changes in "health in general" among
stroke survivors were determined to be minimal, this can only
be considered a crude measure of disability after stroke.
Future investigations should endeavor to generate more

complete data that will allow for integration of morbidity and
mortality as a better measure of the success of a decrease in
stroke case-fatality.25
One previous study that reported on trends in stroke
prevalence for the US population11 found the prevalence of
stroke in the community-dwelling US population older than
45 years of age increased from 2.57% to 3.33% between
1979­1981 and 1989­1991.11 Overall the authors concluded
that the prevalence of stroke was found to be "somewhat
higher at the end of the 1980s than it was at the beginning."
This interpretation is consistent with results from the current
analysis that also indicated a higher age-, race-, and sex-
adjusted stroke prevalence in the later time periods. Several
differences between the current study and the previous study
are worth noting. First, estimates in the previous study were
based on data from National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS). Age-specific stroke prevalence estimates in NHIS
are about 50% lower than estimates based on NHANES
data.11 For example, based on NHIS estimates, stroke prev-
alence among the population 45 years of age for the period
1989­1991 was reported to be 3.3%. Using NHANES III
data, the prevalence of stroke between 1988 and 1994 for this
same age group was 4.6%. Similar discrepancies in disease
prevalence between NHANES and NHIS are present for
myocardial infarction27,28 and may be a result of the use of
proxy interviews in NHIS. Second, NHIS reported on data
from 1979­1991,11 whereas our study used data collected
between 1971 and 1994. Additionally, the previous study of
stroke trends in the US population investigated trends in
disability due to stroke and concluded that "the prevalence of
limitation of activity due to stroke did not increase." Our
study was limited to self-reported health in general, and
similar to the previous study's results, this measure remained
unchanged among stroke survivors in all 3 periods. Finally,
the current study extends previous reports by combining
prevalence and population trends to calculate trends in stroke
survivor counts, an important component in assessing the
burden of stroke survival on the family, community, and
healthcare system.
There are several caveats that should be kept in mind when
making inferences from these results. First, the assessment of
stroke was based on self-report. In other studies, about 80%
of self-reports of strokes can be validated by medical rec-
ords.29 If the validity of self-reports is similar for the
NHANES surveys, estimates of relative change in stroke
prevalence will be unaffected by such misclassification.30
However, because of improved neurological imaging proce-
dures, stroke may be better detected and more accurately
reported in the later periods. Second, the NHANES surveys
are limited to the noninstitutionalized civilian population of
the US; a large proportion of stroke survivors may have
severe disabilities, be in nursing homes, and not part of the
surveyed (target) population in NHANES.11 Thus, the report
likely underestimates the population burden of disease. How-
ever, data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey
indicates that a substantial change in the number of hospital-
discharged patients aged 25 to 74 years sent to long-term care
facilities did not occur between 1981 and 1994. Third, the
recording of race groups in NHANES I and II necessitated the
grouping of Mexican-Americans with non-Hispanic whites.
The prevalence of a history of stroke was different between
Mexican-Americans and whites in NHANES III, but we were
unable to assess trends in any such difference. Although the
overall results are unaffected by this concern, the race-
specific analyses should be interpreted with caution. Finally,
the prevalence of stroke is low, limiting the precision of the
estimates. For example, in NHANES I, only 292 participants
had a self-reported history of stroke; this relatively small
number resulted in substantial variability in estimates, wide
confidence intervals surrounding point estimates resulting in
nonstatistically significant results, and an inability to inves-
tigate trends in more refined subgroups. However, the survey
methodology applied in the current analysis takes into ac-
count the sampling design used in NHANES, providing
confidence that the estimates attained are reliable.
The NHANES I and II surveys included only the popula-
tion under age 75 years.20,21 Thus, trends in stroke prevalence
in the US population older than age 75 years cannot be
estimated. The population older than 75 years of age com-
prises a substantial percentage of stroke incidence, preva-
lence, and mortality. In NHANES III, the prevalence of
stroke among the population older than age 75 years was
11.3% (95% CI: 10.0%,12.8%), more than twice that of the
60- to 74-year-old age group. Additionally, there were 1.3
million stroke survivors older than 75 years of age in
NHANES III, bringing the total number of stroke survivors in
the US population at that time to 3.7 million. Between 1973
and 1991, the US population older than age 75 years
increased from 7 million to 11.9 million persons.31,32 Even if
the prevalence of stroke remained constant (11.3%) in this
age group, the number of stroke survivors age 75 and older
would have increased by more than 400 000 ([11.9 million to

7 million] 11.3%). This is likely to be an underestimate to
the extent that survival from stroke improved during the
1980s.12 The changes in prevalence and number of stroke
survivors for the population older than 75 years may have a
substantial effect on stroke trends if these changes differ from
trends in younger age groups. Future investigations should
focus on the prevalence of stroke among the population older
than 75 years.
In conclusion, the age-, race-, and sex-adjusted prevalence
of stroke among the US population 25 to 74 years of age
increased by 30% in the United States between 1973 and
1991. Over the same time period, the number of stroke
survivors younger than age 75 years increased by 930 000.
These data highlight the importance of the care and rehabil-
itation of a growing stroke survivor population.
