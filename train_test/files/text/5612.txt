Abstract
Objective: A meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of telbivudine (TBV) and lamivudine
(LAM) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), assessed via changes in serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) levels.
Method: The electronic literature databases PubMedÕ, EmbaseÕ, Web of Science, Cochrane
Library, CISCOM, CINAHL, Google Scholar, China BioMedicine and China National Knowledge
Infrastructure were searched for relevant studies. The effect of TBV and LAM treatment on serum
ALT was assessed using standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results: The meta-analysis included six studies (TBV n ¼ 202; LAM, n ¼ 208). Post-treatment ALT
levels were significantly lower than pretreatment values for both TBV and LAM (TBV: SMD ¼ 3.00,
95%CI 1.91, 4.09; LAM: SMD ¼ 2.33, 95%CI 1.58, 3.07). Post-treatment ALTwas significantly lower
after treatment with TBV than LAM (SMD ¼ 0.58, 95%CI 0.21, 0.94).
Conclusion: Both LAM and TBV are effective in normalizing ALT levels in patients with CHB, but
TBV may be a better choice due to its lower rates of drug resistance.

carcinoma.2 CHB is caused by hepatitis B
virus (HBV), which is transmitted in bodily
fluids (for example, via used hypodermic
needles, blood transfusion, vertical trans-
mission from mother to child during birth,
and sexual transmission).3 Untreated
patients are vulnerable to liver-related
sequelae.4 An estimated 5% of the total
worldwide population is infected with HBV,
and approximately 500 000 patients annu-
ally die of HBV-related complications,
including CHB.5 The incidence of CHB
varies widely, with the highest rates in the
Asia­Pacific and sub Saharan Africa.6 Risk
factors for the development of CHB include
vertical transmission of HBV from mother
to infant,7 age, alcohol use and HIV
infection.8
The antiviral nucleoside analogues telbi-
vudine (TBV) and lamivudine (LAM) are
promising treatments for CHB.9 HBV DNA
levels are the most critical clinical criterion
for the judgement of antiviral treatment
efficacy, and patients with persistently ele-
vated HBV DNA have a heightened risk of
cancers including hepatocellular carcin-
oma.10,11 The serum alanine aminotransfer-
ase (ALT) concentration is an important
marker of CHB12 and is commonly used to
assess hepatocellular injury and liver health.
12 LAM effectively reduces serum viral load,
improves ALT levels and liver fibrosis, and
accelerates hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)
seroconversion rates.13­15 Treatment with
LAM reduces ALT levels in patients who
were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg), suggesting that LAM can inhibit
HBV transmission and normalize ALT.16
TBV has been shown to be more effective
than LAM in the treatment of patients
with CHB,17­19 as well having a superior
therapeutic response and resistance
profile.18,20­23
The aim of the present meta-analysis was
to compare the efficacy of TBV and LAM in
the treatment of CHB (assessed via ALT
levels and HBV DNA stratum).
Materials and methods
Data sources and keywords
Eligible studies published up to 30 June 2014
were identified by searching the electronic
literature databases PubMedÕ, EmbaseÕ,
Web of Science, Cochrane Library,
CISCOM, CINAHL, Google Scholar, China
BioMedicine (CBM) and China National
Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The fol-
lowing keywords and search strategies were
used: (``hepatitis B surface antigens'' OR

``GR109714X'' OR ``BCH189''). In addition,
referencelistsofrelevantarticlesweresearched
to identify additional relevant papers. No
language restrictions were set in this meta-
analysis. When articles provided unclear add-
itional data in their original publications, the
first authors were contacted for clarification.
Selection criteria
To be included, studies had to fulfil all of the
following criteria: (i) patients with CHB;
(ii) human clinical cohort studies or diag-
nostic tests focused on CHB diagnosis with
administration of LAM or TBV; (iii) pre and
post-treatment data for serum ALT levels;
(4) report adjusted standard mean differ-
ences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CI) for ALT serum level; (5) number of
patients stated; and (6) >20 patients. When
studies had populations overlapping >50%
with two or more papers, the one with the
most comprehensive population was

included. When the same authors published
more than one study with the same popula-
tion, only the latest or most complete was
included. All authors approved the final list
of included studies.
Data extraction
Data were extracted from the included
studies by two investigators (M.D. and
G.M.X.) independently and in duplicate. If
necessary, consensus was achieved by dis-
cussion and re-examination. The following
data were extracted from eligible studies:
surname of first author; date of publication;
source of publication; study type; study
design; sample size; age; sex; ethnicity and
country of subjects; source of samples;
detection method for ALT serum level;
time of post-treatment sampling; serum
ALT levels; and HBV DNA levels.
Quality assessment
Quality of the included studies was assessed
by two investigators (F.L.W. and J.S.Z.)
independently and in duplicate, using pre-
defined criteria based on Newcastle-Ottawa
Scale (NOS) criteria.24 The NOS criteria are
based on three aspects: (i) subject selection
(0­4); (ii) comparability of subjects (0­2);
(iii) clinical outcome (0­3). Total NOS
scores range from 0 (lowest) to 9 (highest).
According to the NOS scores, the included
studies were classified as low quality (0­6) or
high quality (7­9). Discrepancies regarding
NOS scores were resolved by discussion and
consultation with an additional reviewer
(D.J.X.).
Statistical analyses
The effect size of each study was calculated
using Z test with summary SMD (95%CI).
Heterogeneity was evaluated using
Cochran's Q-statistic (P < 0.05 was
regarded as statistically significant),25 and
I2 test (0%, no heterogeneity; 100%, max-
imal heterogeneity).26 If between-study het-
erogeneity existed, the random-effects model
(DerSimonian and Laird) was used to cal-
culate the pooled ORs; otherwise the fixed-
effects model was used (Mantel­Haenszel).
Meta-regression and subgroup meta-ana-
lyses were performed for detection method
and postreatment time. One-way sensitivity
analysis was performed and publication bias
was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's
linear regression test.27 Data were inputted
into STATAÕ software (version 12.0; Stata
Corp, College Station, TX, USA) by two
investigators (Y.M.L. and H.Z.Y.) inde-
pendently and in duplicate.
Results
The study selection procedure is displayed in
Figure 1. The literature search identified 132
papers on the basis of title and key words.
After screening according to exclusion cri-
teria, the final meta-analysis included six
studies (TBV n ¼ 202; LAM, n ¼ 208),28­33
of which three were low quality (NOS
score ¼ 6)28,29,33 and three were of high qual-
ity (NOS score >6).30­32 All studies were
performed in Asians, with five in China and
one in Thailand. The studies and their
main characteristics are listed in Table 1.
Meta-analyses for the effects of TBV and
LAM on serum ALT are shown in Figure 2.
There was significant heterogeneity (TBV
pretreatment vs post-treatment, I2 ¼ 97.8%,
P < 0.001; LAM pretreatment vs post-treat-
ment, I2 ¼ 96.3%, P < 0.001; post-treatment
LAM vs TBV, I2 ¼ 96.3%, P < 0.001), there-
fore the random-effects model was used.
Post-treatment ALT levels were significantly
lower than pretreatment values for both
TBV and LAM (TBV: SMD ¼ 3.00,
95%CI 1.91, 4.09, P < 0.001; LAM:
SMD ¼ 2.33, 95%CI 1.58, 3.07, P < 0.001).
Post-treatment ALT was significantly lower
after treatment with TBV than after LAM
(SMD ¼ 0.58, 95%CI 0.21, 0.94, P ¼ 0.002).
Dai et al. 163
HBV DNA levels were significantly lower
than baseline after LAM treatment
(SMD ¼ 1.75, 95%CI 1.14, 2.35, P < 0.001).
Subgroup analyses based on detection
method are shown in Figure 3. For both
TBV and LAM, post-treatment ALT levels
were significantly lower than pretreatment
values for all detection methods (P < 0.05
for each comparison). For between-drug
analyses, postreatment ALT levels were
significantly lower in patients treated with
TBV than in those treated with LAM, when
samples were analysed using an automatic
biochemical analyser (ACA) or unknown
method, (ACA: SMD ¼ 0.63, 95%CI
0.26,1.01, P ¼ 0.001; unknown method:
SMD ¼ 2.77, 95%CI 1.20, 4.33, P ¼ 0.001).

difference in post-treatment ALT when
samples were analysed using electrochemi-
luminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), how-
ever (Figure 3).
Subgroup analyses based on time of post-
treatment sampling are shown in Figure 3.
Time of post-treatment sampling was clas-
sified as <24 or !24 weeks. Post-treatment
ALT levels were significantly lower than
pretreatment values for both TBV and
LAM, in both the <24 and !24 weeks
subgroups (P < 0.05 for each comparison).
In the !24 weeks subgroup, post-treatment
ALT levels were higher in patients treated
with LAM than in patients treated with
TBV (SMD ¼ 1.38, 95%CI 0.76, 1.99,
P < 0.001). There were no significant
between-group differences in the <24
weeks subgroup.
Sensitivity analyses indicated that the
meta-analysis was stable (Figure 4). Funnel
plots and Egger's test found strong evidence
for publication bias in the comparison
between pre-TBV and post-TBV treatment
ALT levels (P < 0.001). There was no evi-
dence of publication bias in the comparison
between pre-LAM and post-LAM treatment
ALT levels, or in TBV vs LAM treatment.
Discussion
The current meta-analysis compared the
relative efficacy of TBV and LAM in the
treatment of CHB infection (assessed via
serum ALT levels), and found that both
drugs significantly reduced ALT compared
with pretreatment levels. In addition, TBV
resulted in a significantly greater decrease in
ALT levels than LAM.
Studies have shown that LAM can
improve liver histology and suppress viral
DNA replication in patients with CHB after
1 year of treatment, with reversal of cirrhosis
and fibrosis observed after 3 years.34
Although LAM has a good safety profile
in the treatment of HBV infection, resistance

hepatitis flare and liver decompensation) is a
growing problem.35 TBV has lower resist-
ance rates, causes viral suppression by
inhibiting HBV DNA synthesis,18 and has
higher rates of survival, virological response,
therapeutic response, HBeAg loss and ALT
normalization than LAM.19,36 In addition,
TBV has a high seroconversion rate and no
carcinogenic, mutagenic or embryonic toxic
effects.37 Other nucleoside analogues include
adefovir dipivoxil fumarate (ADF), enteca-
vir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
(TDF).38 Although ETV and TDF are first-
line drugs for CHB, we evaluated LAM due
to its clinical relevance and TBV due to its
known effect on ALT.7,37,38
Although ALT levels are decreased by
treatment with nucleoside analogues such as
LAM and TBV, levels have been shown to
increase after withdrawal of treatment.39,40
Studies have found that TBV provides
greater and more consistent suppression of
HBV DNA than LAM, which may be
reflected in normalization of ALT
levels.7,41 The between-drug difference in
post-treatment ALT levels in the present
analysis may be a result of LAM drug
resistance. The current meta-analysis indi-
cated that LAM treatment significantly
decreased HBV DNA levels compared with
baseline, which may lead to a reduction in
HBV-related complications.42 Our data are

in accordance with others who found that
TBV resulted in significantly greater
decreases in serum ALT than LAM, as
well as a significantly higher survival rate
in patients with CHB.20
We conducted subgroup analyses to
determine whether detection method had
any effect on our findings. In all subgroups
(ACA, ECLIA and unknown), both TBV
and LAM resulted in significant decreases in
ALT levels, but the superiority of TBV
could not be demonstrated when samples
were analysed using ECLIA. This could be
explained by differences between detection

methods, but may also be due to the small
number of studies involved. In addition,
time of post-treatment sampling had no
effect on the finding that TBV and LAM
decreased ALT levels, but there was no
significant between-drug difference when
ALT was assessed at <24 weeks post-
treatment. This finding suggests that the
difference between LAM and TBV is not
apparent in the early stages of treatment.
Both TBV and LAM are capable of
normalizing ALT levels in patients with
CHB, but TBV is preferred because of its
relatively low resistance levels.
The present study had several limitations.
Since it was a cross-sectional retrospective
study, our analysis did not take into consid-
eration changes in viral load or treatment
efficacy over time. In addition, due to limited
data, it was not possible to analyse pheno-
typic or genotypic resistance, restricting our
results to a narrow clinical application.

We did not include some unpublished art-
icles and abstracts due to incomplete data.
Additionally, three of the six included
studies were of low methodological quality
due to insufficient data and lack of adjust-
ment for confounding factors. This may be a
source of heterogeneity and could affect our
findings. Differences in included criteria,
follow-up periods, treatment efficacy and
severity of disease are also potential sources
of heterogeneity. Although each study
population was well defined and had similar
inclusion criteria, there may be unknown
factors that could have influenced our
results. The participants included in this
study did not differ significantly from other
Asian population-based or hospital-based
patients in terms of age/sex distribution,
HBeAg and HBsAg status, or HBV DNA
levels. The fact that all of the studies
investigated Asian populations limits the
applicability of these findings to other
ethnicities. Finally, these findings may be
influenced by the high levels of heterogeneity
in our study. Further, larger scale clinical
trials are required to contribute to
the screening and development of individua-
lized treatment schemes for patients with
CHB.
In conclusion, both LAM and TBV are
effective in normalizing ALT levels in
patients with CHB, but TBV may be a
better choice due to its lower rates of drug
resistance.
