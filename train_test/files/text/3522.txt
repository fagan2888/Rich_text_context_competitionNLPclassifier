Comparing Health Care Financial
Burden With an Alternative Measure of
Unaffordability
Edward S. Kielb, BS1, Corwin N. Rhyan, MPP1, and James A. Lee, MS1
Abstract
Health insurance plans with high deductibles increase exposure to health care costs, raising concerns about how the growth
in these plans may be impacting both the financial burden of health care expenditures on families and their access to health
care. We find that foregoing medical care is common among low-income, privately insured families, occurring at a greater
rate than those with higher incomes or Medicare coverage. To better understand the relationship between out-of-pocket
(OOP) spending and access, we used the 2011-2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data and a logistic model
to analyze the likelihood of avoiding or delaying needed medical care based on health insurance design and other individual
and family characteristics. We find that avoiding or delaying medical care is strongly correlated with coverage under a high-
deductible health plan, and with depression, poor perceived health, or poverty. However, it is relatively independent of
the percent of income spent on OOP costs, making the percent of income spent on OOP costs by itself a poor measure
of health care unaffordability. Individuals who spend a small percentage of their income on health care costs may still be
extremely burdened by their health plan when financial concerns prevent access to health care. This work emphasizes the
importance of insurance design as a predictor of access and the need to expand the definition of financial barriers to care
beyond expenditures, particularly for the low-income, privately insured population.

Introduction
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) instituted a wide array of
changes to the health insurance marketplace resulting in
increased access for many previously uninsured individuals and
increased standards for those with private employer or market-
place, nongroup coverage. While most notable for the resulting
drop in uninsured rates across the country, primarily driven by
the state Medicaid expansions and employer and individual
mandates, the law also established regulations requiring stricter
standards for a minimum acceptable level of coverage.1,2 These
standards include guaranteed issue (preventing insurers from
excluding those with preexisting conditions), the elimination of
lifetime spending caps, limits on annual deductibles, limits on
annual out-of-pocket (OOP) spending, and requirements that
plans cover services considered essential to an individual's
health. These standards are aimed at reducing underinsurance, a
situation where an individual's coverage either leaves them lia-
ble for an unsustainable amount of medical OOP expenses or
results in the inability to receive necessary care.3
Despite the ACA regulations and guaranteed level of
coverage, for many low-income individuals in the non-
group, individual market and employees covered with
employer-sponsored insurance, their plan leaves them
underinsured. This is especially true for those offered high-
deductible health plans (HDHPs), which under the law in
2015 were allowed to have deductibles up to $6600 for an
individual and $13 200 for a family. While often paired
with health savings accounts (HSAs), a high-deductible
plan for a low-income individual places a potentially sig-
nificant burden for medical expenses before the deductible
is reached as many of these individuals are unable to fund
their HSA.4 Furthermore, while these plans are subject to
the OOP maximums established by the law, services not
classified as essential health benefits and services provided
out-of-network may not count toward the annual cap, fur-
ther exposing an individual to higher expenses.

2 INQUIRY
The use of HDHPs has increased substantially over the
past 10 years, carrying with it several major concerns for
low-income enrollees.5 First, that these individuals will be
forced to spend a large percentage of their income on health
care expenses. Thresholds of 10% or 20% of total income
have been identified as levels of concern for combined
spending on premiums and OOP medical expenses. Previous
work has shown that families making less than 200% of the
Federal Poverty Level (FPL) are far more likely to have a
health care financial burden--the percent of income spent on
premiums and OOP costs--above these thresholds.6,7,8,9 In
addition, it has been shown that these risks are even more
pronounced in the pool of low-income individuals with
HDHPs, who have almost twice the risk of health care expen-
ditures exceeding 20% of income than those with a plan
without such high deductibles.10,11 Furthermore, recent
research has analyzed the impact of HDHPs on medical
expenditures. HDHPs appear to cause reduced spending on
outpatient care and pharmaceuticals, though no judgment has
been yet been made on how such plan changes impact low-
wage, privately insured persons.12,13,14
A potential complementary concern for the underinsured
is that they avoid receiving necessary medical care alto-
gether, such as dental care, filling prescriptions, or critical
medical procedures.15 Previous work that has looked solely
at health care financial burden as a percent of income effec-
tively censors those with the inability to spend on health
care, and thus does not capture this concern. A low-income
individual who spends 0% of their income on health care
may nevertheless be extremely burdened by their underin-
surance if they completely avoided care due to the potential
OOP costs. Moreover, financial burden as a measure of
underinsurance is problematic because the OOP caps under
ACA make it mathematically impossible for some middle-
income families to reach the 10% or 20% of income thresh-
old, despite the possibility they may be significantly impacted
by their medical expenses.16 Previous work modeling
avoided or delayed care only in families with children dem-
onstrated that in such families, a measure of these concerns
is a better predictor of unmet needs than raw OOP costs.17
It is important to note that the concept of underinsurance
includes components beyond the economic concerns of avoid-
ing care due to cost and percentage of income spent on health
care expenses mentioned above. Previous work has also identi-
fied underinsurance can occur as a result of plans not covering
particular services or providers (structural underinsurance) or
from an individual's perception of the quality of a health plan
and its coverage (attitudinal underinsurance).18 Qualitative
underinsurance measures to assess these concerns using access
to care questions have been previously demonstrated in an
analysis of the impacts of theACAon people's access to health
care.19 Furthermore, using the 2007 HealthTracking Household
Survey, it was demonstrated that almost 20 percent of US
adults faced some manner of unaffordability barrier to medical
care.20 It has also been found that lower income persons are
more likely to experience nonfinancial barriers and less likely
to use health care than their higher income counterparts.21
In this article, we focus primarily on economic and attitu-
dinal factors of underinsurance. To measure the attitudinal
factor of underinsurance, we defined an unaffordability met-
ric to identify individuals who avoid or delay medical care as
a result of cost. We then compare this metric with a health
care financial burden indicator--percent of family income
spent on health care--measuring economic factors of under-
insurance. Finally, focusing on the privately insured popula-
tion, we develop a logistic model to predict the impact of
financial barriers, plan type, and health characteristics on
unaffordability concerns for this population.
Study Data and Methods
We analyzed the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)
using SAS version 9.4. The MEPS population is a subset of
the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) respondents
and is designed to provide nationally representative spending
estimates of per-capita medical procedures. The most recent
available data is from 2014. It was collected from March to
May 2015 and includes responses from 34,875 individuals.
Each individual is reported as part of a larger family with a
corresponding characteristic weight determined by demo-
graphic and financial factors, thus allowing us to collapse the
data to the household level. We used the Current Population
Survey (CPS) family weights; the differences with MEPS-
defined weights are small, but the CPS definition is broader.22
For example, using the CPS definition, college students away
from home count as members of their family's household.
Outcome Variables
Our central data definition concerns unaffordability. We
defined it as a dichotomous variable on a household level
using a series of access to care questions. A family is defined
as having an unaffordability concern if any member of that
family reported either delay or loss of medical care, prescrip-
tion medication, or dental care for financial reasons. We
assume that family members typically pool resources used
for medical care and that therefore unaffordability concern
for any member of the family extends to others within that
family. This accords with recent publications using unafford-
ability as a measure of financial barriers.16,17,18 Exact MEPS
questions used to compute the unaffordability metric are
found in Online Appendix A.
A second key variable is health care financial burden,
which estimates financial barriers facing families. We defined
health care financial burden as the proportion of total OOP
medical expenditures divided by total income for each family.
Previous work that quantifies health care financial burden
using MEPS data sometimes includes individual contributions
to premiums in addition to OOP expenditures for the privately
insured population.7 Our measure of health care financial
Kielb et al 3
burden in this article only includes OOP expenditures for 2
reasons. First, because we model unaffordability, which
focuses on care decisions made at the margin, OOP expendi-
tures may best represent the spending that is made for a mar-
ginal unit of medical care. Second, the MEPS data contain
premium expenditures only for the privately insured popula-
tion; therefore, only including OOP health care financial bur-
den best allows for comparison across insurance types.
A final important outcome variable is the presence of an
HDHP. MEPS separates out insurance plans according to
their deductible within the privately insured population,
allowing us to define a dichotomous variable as 1 for persons
with a plan that has a deductible of at least $1300/$2600 for
a single/family plan, respectively, and 0 otherwise. This dis-
tinction has been used in recent literature indicating a link
between HDHPs and high health care financial burden.10
Analytical Methods
Our first aim was to characterize unaffordability concerns
across the US population. To accomplish this, we broke
down the US population into subgroups differentiated by
insurance type and income bracket. We then analyzed the
relationship between unaffordability concerns and high
health care financial burden within each group, to determine
the overlap between the two.
Using these subgroups, we calculated a range of summary
statistics, including using MEPS family weights to calculate
the number of families within that group across the US popu-
lation, unaffordability concerns, and health care financial
burden. Next, we calculated how unaffordability problems
within these subgroups have varied over time.
Finally, we set out to determine factors that had an impact
on unaffordability among the privately insured, and included
them into a model of families who would be most likely to
have financial concerns regarding OOP medical expendi-
tures. We thus developed a series of predictive logistic mod-
els of unaffordability on a household level to achieve this
goal. A logistic model measures the percentage change in the
odds of a dependent variable based on a 1-unit increase from
a given baseline in each individual independent variable. We
categorized indicator variables into 4 groups: income indica-
tors, demographic indicators, psychological and health indi-
cators, and insurance plan indicators. We then modeled
unaffordability using income and each other indicator cate-
gory, with one overall model including all significant indica-
tors from our first three. The rationale behind the chosen
indicators within each group was based on the authors' intu-
ition, MEPS data availability, and ensuring that the chosen
indicators provided a comprehensive basis for each group.
We used P values of .05, .01, and .001 for determining levels
of statistical significance of the relationship between inde-
pendent indicators and unaffordability in each model, using
.01 as a cutoff for indicator inclusion in our overall model.
Results and Analysis
Our first aim was to compare unaffordability with health
care financial burden as a measure of financial barriers for
the US population. Figure 1 shows that not only are financial
concerns relatively nonoverlapping with high health care
financial burden but also that reliance on health care finan-
cial burden misses a large portion of the population that is
foregoing care and therefore potentially not spending much

money on health care. The correlation coefficient r is
-0.06753 between high health care financial burden and
unaffordability and is not statistically significantly different
from 0 (indicating independence).
Summary statistics of unaffordability across all insurance
types and income groups are shown in Table 1.
Table 1 demonstrates that low-wage (income <200% of
the FPL), privately insured families, a group that encom-
passes more than 14 million households, face high unafford-
ability barriers to receiving medical care, with between 14%
and 16% of such families reporting foregoing medical care
as a result of cost. This stands in stark contrast to higher
wage, privately insured families, which tend to face among
the lowest unaffordability barriers to receiving care of any
group. The low-wage, privately insured groups also have
very high levels of average financial burden, even sometimes
exceeding annual income, particularly when premium costs
are included. In the low-wage, privately insured population,
financial burdens above 100% of annual income are most
likely a result of families relying on savings to pay for their
premiums and OOP expenses.
Trends of financial barriers over the past 4 years are
shown in Figure 2. Unaffordability barriers facing privately
insured families with the lowest incomes (0-100 FPL)
reached a 4-year high in 2014, while consistently surpassing
Medicare and approaching the concerns reported by public-
only insured families. It is noteworthy that both the number
of uninsured families as well as the rate at which uninsured
families report financial concerns have decreased substan-
tially over the past 4 years.
To better understand the results shown in Table 1 and
Figure 2, we tested a series of models looking for a set of
indicators that had statistically significant relationships with
unaffordability within the privately insured population
(Table 2). Indicator definitions not found in the text can be
found in Online Appendix C.
Table 2 displays the parameters of a series of predictive
logistic models. For example, a 1-unit change in family
income in our model refers to 10 000 dollars; in our Income
+ Demographic indicators model, for example, for every
additional 10 000 dollars of family income, there is a 6.8%
decrease in the odds of that family reporting a financial
concern.
Every model indicates that family income is signifi-
cantly correlated with unaffordability using a P value of
.001. In addition, this correlation is relatively stable
regardless of which other independent indicators are held
constant. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis
that low-wage families are more likely to forego medical
care due to its cost.
Perceived health has a strong positive correlation with
unaffordability--the poorer someone's perceived health, the
more likely they are to report unaffordability concerns. This
indicator was significant using a P value of .001.
Depression in a family's reference person demonstrated a
strong correlation with likelihood to report unaffordability

Discussion
By implementing a metric for health care unaffordability, we
are able to demonstrate the importance of considering both
unaffordability and health care financial burden concerns in
at-risk populations. The relative lack of intersection between
families with financial concerns and those with high health
care financial burden (Figure 1) indicates that these 2 con-
cerns represent distinct and complementary problems of
potential underinsurance. The substantial proportion of fami-
lies that avoid or delay care, despite not reaching a 10% or
20% financial burden threshold, emphasizes the importance
of a qualitative unaffordability metric. Avoided or delayed
care, which our results show is surprisingly common among
low-income and uninsured families, represents a significant
public health concern. Delaying and avoiding care likely
results in poorer management of chronic health conditions,
increases the chance health problems go undiagnosed, and
likely increases future health care costs by failing to prevent
more severe health conditions. Avoidance of care due to
financial concerns is necessary to consider alongside health
care expenditures, and with increased patient cost-sharing
and the rising prevalence of HDHPs, low-income families
are at an even greater risk for both high health care financial
burden and unaffordability concerns.
In our model of unaffordability risk, we identify factors
that compound to put a privately insured family at risk for
avoiding or delaying medical care even beyond income
(Table 2). In particular, we find large and significant
reported risks of avoiding care when a family is covered
under an HDHP, when their reference person has worse
perceived health, and when their reference person reports
depression. These results both support recent findings that
HDHPs result in significant increased financial barriers to
obtaining care and invite several possible psychological
explanations.10 The first is that those who are depressed or
perceive themselves to be unhealthy are more likely to
report negative experiences, such as foregoing medical
care due to its cost.23 The second is that persons who can-
not afford medical care become depressed or unhealthy as
a result of the financial barriers they are facing.24 While
the latter represents a possible reverse causality wherein
unaffordability results in depression, the true directionality
is unknown. Previous work into this relationship has dem-
onstrated that depression may directly influence access to
care through multiple mechanisms.25 The percentage of
family income spent on OOP expenditures is not predictive
of reporting unaffordability concerns, likely due to the
independence between unaffordability and health care
financial burden.
When using our unaffordability definition to identify indi-
viduals who are significantly underinsured, it is important to
note the risk of false-positives. Our unaffordability metric is
based on qualitative survey responses within the MEPS
questionnaire, which is more ambiguous than calculated
measures of expenditure burden. We can observe this possi-
ble false identification of at-risk families by looking at the
results in the >400% FPL privately insured population.
While we typically would not define these families as finan-
cially at risk, our unaffordability metric shows a larger-than-
expected percentage who report avoiding or delaying medical
care due to cost. This may be a result of those who, even at
high income levels, are particularly price sensitive.26 It could
also be a result of those who have a distaste of high medical
costs or by the politicization of recent health care debates.
Our multiyear analyses indicate a slight downward trend
in unaffordability concerns in some of the most at-risk
groups, including both the privately insured population
between 100% and 200% of FPL and the uninsured popula-
tion from 2011 to 2014 (Figure 2); both trends could be a
result of Medicaid expansion under the ACA.27 We find that
the low-wage, privately insured population remains more
vulnerable to reporting foregoing medical care due to finan-
cial barriers than the Medicare population and is almost as
vulnerable as the Medicaid population. These results add an
important rationale to refocus research and policy on this
group.
Conclusion
Low-wage, privately insured individuals present a unique
research and policy opportunity for improving medical care
accessibility and unaffordability in the United States. To
examine financial barriers within this population, we applied
a measure of unaffordability and demonstrated its distinct
and complementary relationship with the established health
care financial burden measure of barriers to accessing care.
From our unaffordability measure, we created a model of
barriers facing the privately insured population. This model
pointed to both vulnerability of low-wage populations to
unaffordability concerns and HDHPs having a strong nega-
tive impact on families reporting being able to afford medi-
cal care. These results highlight the value of increased
research on low-wage, privately insured persons, as well as
further investigation into the impacts of high-deductible
health plans on financial barriers to obtaining medical care.
