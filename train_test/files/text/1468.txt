INTRODUCTION
Obesity is generally recognized as an increasingly impor-
tant cause of childhood and adolescent morbidity world-
wide and is a contributor to chronic diseases such as type 2
diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (1). The metabolic
syndrome (MetS), a clustering of obesity, impaired glucose
metabolism, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, has been shown
to be predictive for the development of diabetes and CVD
in this young population, particularly in the overweight or
obese (2). MetS has appeared with increasing frequency in
children and adolescents, driven by the growing pediatric
obesity epidemic (1).
Behavioral factors such as poor dietary habits, a sedentary
lifestyle, and a social environment which encourages unhealthy
behaviors are closely correlated with the prevalence of obesi-
ty and MetS in adolescents (3). During adolescence develop-
mental physiologic changes in body composition, lipid pro-
file, blood pressure, insulin secretion and number of body fat
cells occur as a result of higher levels of sex and growth hor-
mones. This results in increased insulin resistance that is asso-
ciated with MetS. Therefore, the convergence of hormonal
changes associated with adolescence and unhealthy lifestyle
behaviors can predispose this group to MetS and obesity and
a risk of adverse CVD events later in life (3).
Although obesity in children and adolescents has been
widely studied, MetS has not because a consensus on pedi-
atric MetS criteria did not exist until recently (4). In order
to fill this gap, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF)
published the first international definition of the pediatric
MetS in 2007 (4), facilitating comparisons between pediatric
populations (5). The IDF advocates waist circumference (WC)
as a key diagnostic component of pediatric MetS (4) as in the
adult definition. Comparisons for adolescents of different coun-
tries, ethnicities, and genders should be published to evalu-
ate international criteria for MetS like the 2007 IDF defini-

Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity in Adolescents Aged
12 to 19 Years: Comparison between the United States and Korea
This study compared the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), its risk factors,
and obesity in adolescents in the United States (US) and Korea. Data were obtained
from 2003-2004 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
and 2005 Korea NHANES for adolescents aged 12-19 yr in the US (n=734) and
in Korea (n=664). The 2007 International Diabetes Federation (IDF) pediatric defini-
tion for diagnosis of MetS and the 2000 US Growth Charts and 2007 Korea Growth
Charts for assessment of obesity were utilized. The prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome in US and Koreans was 5.5% and 2.5%, respectively. The prevalence of
obesity was 18.1% in US compared to 9.0% in Koreans. The prevalence of abdom-
inal obesity, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia were higher in the US, where-
as that of low HDL-C levels was higher in Korea. Despite the doubled prevalence
for the single entities of MetS and obesity in the US, the prevalence of MetS in obese
US and Koreans did not differ (20.8% and 24.3%, respectively). In conclusion, there
are differences in the prevalence of MetS, obesity, and the individual MetS risk
factors between the US and Korean adolescents; however, the risk of MetS among
obese adolescents is similar in both countries.

tion. Using the IDF definition as a starting point, modifica-
tions can be made on the basis of new information (4).
Most studies in adolescents have been limited to Western
countries and infrequently included Asians (6, 7). Asians, on
average, have a lower body mass than Western populations
and their traditional diets and lifestyle are not commonly asso-
ciated with obesity or CVD risk. However, the incidence of
obese children and adolescents has been increasing in Korea,
as has urbanization and economic development. Accompany-
ing these changes is the adoption of a westernized diet and a
trend toward decreased physical activity (8). As young Asian
individuals continue to adopt Western lifestyles, it is impor-
tant to predict the types of population-based health conse-
quences that might follow. Our study had three main hypo-
theses: 1) US adolescents have a higher prevalence of obesity
and MetS than Korean adolescents; 2) individual abnormal-
ities of MetS differ between US and Korean adolescents; and
3) Korean adolescents have an equal or greater prevalence of
MetS when compared to US adolescents of the same BMI cat-
egory, since Asians have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and
CVD at lower BMI's than European populations (9). By com-
paring the differences in the prevalence of MetS and obesity
in US and Korean adolescents using the latest national data-
sets, we set out to provide guidance both to countries whose
population is starting to embrace Western lifestyles and to
Western societies who wish to reduce the high burden of com-
plications from these conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source and subjects
This study was based on data from the 2003-2004 US
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NH-
ANES) (10) and the 2005 Korean NHANES (KNHANES)
(11). Both were cross-sectional nationally representative sur-
veys of the US and Korean civilian non-institutionalized pop-
ulations, and used standardized protocols within each survey
for all interviews and medical examinations (10, 11). Sub-
jects selected from the US NHANES were Mexican-Ameri-
cans, non-Hispanic Whites, and non-Hispanic Blacks and
from the KNHANES were Koreans. The subjects from both
data sets were limited to young men and non-pregnant women
aged 12 to 19 yr who participated in the medical examina-
tion of NHANES and KNHANES and who had fasted at
least 8 hr prior to the blood collection. Only subjects who
had all five indicators of MetS measured according to IDF
criteria were included in the study. Samples of 734 (414 male)
and 664 (359 male) subjects from the US and Korean NH-
ANES, respectively, were used in the analyses, and the esti-
mated US and Korean population represented by each sam-
ple was 25.5 million and 4.4 million, respectively. The pro-
portion of ethnicities that comprised the entire US sample
population in this study was Mexican-Americans 12.2±
3.5%, non-Hispanic Whites 72.5±4.6%, and non-Hispan-
ic Blacks 15.2±2.5%, respectively.
US NHANES and Korean NHANES methodologies have
been described in detail elsewhere (10, 11). Socio-demograph-
ic data were collected by personal interview.
Anthropometric indices such as height, weight, and waist
circumference were also extracted from each database, and body
mass index (BMI) was calculated from height and weight. The
data was obtained in a similar manner in each study. Height
was measured in an upright position with a stadiometer, and
weight was measured at a standing position on a self-zero-
ing scale. Waist circumference was measured at the midpoint
between the bottom of the rib cage and above the top of the
iliac crest during minimal respiration. Laboratory indices and
blood pressure were also collected by a standard protocol, and
the mean of the 2nd and 3rd systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure (SBP and DBP) readings were used for this study.Pulse
pressure was defined as the difference between SBP and DBP.
For both surveys, fasting blood glucose (FBG) was measured
indirectly by spectrophotometry after an enzymatic reaction,
and triglycerides (TG) were indirectly determined by spec-
trophotometry after hydrolyzation to glycerol and two-stage
enzymatic reactions. High density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C) was indirectly measured by spectrophotometry after
precipitation with sulfated alpha-cyclodextrin and a two-stage
enzymatic reaction. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-
C) was calculated using the Friedewald equation (serum total
cholesterol (TC)-(HDL-C)-TG/5) after eliminating those who
had TG greater than 400 mg/dL (12).
Definition of MetS and obesity
Because of the profound physiological and developmental
changes during puberty, the 2007 pediatric IDF definition
of MetS (4) divided children and adolescents into the follow-
ing age groups: 6 to <10, 10 to <16, and 16 yr. Accord-
ing to this definition, the adult IDF guidelines for the MetS
were applied to adolescents 16 years or older, and the KSSO,
a Korean-specific criterion (13), was used for Korean waist
circumference (WC). In individuals aged 10-15 yr, MetS is
present if he or she has central adiposity (90th WC per-
centile or adult threshold if lower) plus at least two of the
following criteria: 1) TG 150 mg/dL, 2) HDL-C <40 mg/
dL, 3) SBP 130 mmHg or DBP 85 mmHg, 4) FBG
100 mg/dL or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes. For
US males aged 12-15 yr, we used adult WC thresholds of 90
cm for Mexican Americans and 94 cm for Whites and African
Americans since these were smaller than the corresponding
90th percentiles for age. For US females of all ages, we used
the adult threshold of 80 cm because it was smaller than their
90th percentile for age. For Korean males and females aged
12-15 yr, we used the WC thresholds (sex- and age-specific
90th percentiles) derived from the reference WC in the 2007
76 J. Park, D.C. Hilmers, J.A. Mendoza, et al.
Korea Growth Charts instead of the recommended adult IDF
threshold criteria which was larger than their 90th percentiles
for age.
To evaluate the prevalence of obesity and MetS by BMI
levels, subjects were classified into three BMI categories (nor-
mal weight, overweight, and obese) using the 2000 US Grow-
th Charts (14) and the 2007 Korea Growth Charts (15). The
analyses by this classification were applied only to individu-
als aged 12-18 yr because the Korean Growth Charts do not
go beyond 18 yr. Obesity was defined as a BMI 95th per-
centile for age and gender; adolescents with a BMI 85th
but <95th percentile were defined as ``overweight;'' and par-
ticipants defined as ``normal weight'' had a BMI from the 5th
to the 85th percentile (14, 15).
Statistical methods
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version
9.1.3, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary NC, USA) and SAS-callable
SUDAAN (version 9.0.3, Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, NC, USA). In order to make a statistical com-
parison between the two countries, selected variables from
the 2003-4 US and 2005 Korean datasets were merged and
the combined data was used in all analyses. Data in all statis-
tical analyses for our study were weighted to account for the
complex sampling design of both NHANES which were mul-
tistage, stratified, unequally weighted, or clustered. Appro-
priate statistical sampling weights from each national dataset
were selected as specified by the respective survey. Estimat-
ed frequencies of categorical variables and mean and standard
error of continuous variables between the two countries were
compared by the chi-square and t-test procedures of SUD-
AAN. Each national sample weight was applied after data
from the two countries were merged into a single file by cre-
ating a new variable. These statistics were presented as mean
±standard error (SE) for continuous variables and frequency
percentage (SE) for all categorical measures. A P value <0.05
was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows anthropometric and clinical measurements
for US and Korean adolescents. Overall, height, weight, and
BMI in the US were significantly higher than in Korean ado-
lescents (all, P<0.001). The US adolescents had significantly
higher FBG and TC than Korean adolescents (both, P<0.001).
However, LDL-C:HDL-C and TC:HDL-C ratios were signif-
icantly higher in Korean adolescents than in the US (both,
P<0.001) resulting from lower HDL-C (P<0.001) and higher
LDL-C (P<0.05) of Koreans. SBP was higher in the US (P<
0.01), while DBP was higher in Korean adolescents (P<0.001);
however, pulse pressure was significantly higher in the US
by about 10 mmHg (P<0.001). Concentrations of TG did
not differ between the two countries.

Korean adolescents according to the 2007 IDF definition is

cents was 5.5±0.9% (males 7.3±1.7%, females 3.5±0.9
%), which is more than twice the prevalence for Korean ado-
lescents, 2.5±0.6% (males 3.6±1.0%, females 1.2±0.6%,
P<0.01). Based on population-weighted estimates, it can be
calculated that -1.4 million US and 0.1 million Korean ado-
lescents aged 12-19 yr have MetS according to the 2007 IDF
pediatric criteria.
The prevalence of abdominal obesity (P<0.001), hyper-
glycemia (P<0.001), and hypertriglyceridemia (P<0.01) in
the US were significantly higher than in Korean adolescents,
while the prevalence of a low HDL-C level was significantly
higher in Korean adolescents (P<0.001). There was a strik-
ing difference in the prevalence of abdominal obesity by gen-
der; the prevalence in American males was more than double
the prevalence in Korean males (US 24.4±2.2% vs. Korea
9.2±1.5%). American females had more than six times the
prevalence found in Korean females (US 46.1±3.7% vs. Korea
7.5±1.6%). US males had nearly seven times the prevalence
of hyperglycemia (US 16.9±2.5% vs. Korea 2.5±0.8%)
and twice the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia (US 17.2
±3.4% vs. Korea 9.7±1.6%). The prevalence of elevated
blood pressure did not show a clear difference overall between
the two countries. The number of metabolic abnormalities
in the US was higher than in Koreans even when abdominal
obesity was not considered. The percentage of adolescents
who had at least one of five MetS risk factors was 56.5±1.8%
in the US and 49.2±2.2% in Korea.
As shown in Table 3, the prevalence of obesity as assessed
by BMI in US adolescents was approximately twice that of
Korean adolescents, 18.1±3.2% (males 22.0±2.6%, females
13.9±4.9%) and 9.0±1.5% (males 9.3±2.1%, females
8.5±2.0%), respectively. Based on population-weighted
estimates, it can be calculated that 4.6 million US and 0.4
million Korean adolescents aged 12-19 yr are obese, using
the respective national criterion for obesity. Since the com-
bined frequency of overweight and obesity was 39.2% in the
US and 21.0% in Korea, the US had more adolescents who
were overweight and obese (P<0.001) while a greater percent-
age of Korean adolescents were normal weight.
Since there were significant differences in mean BMI levels
between the two countries, we compared the frequency of
the individual MetS risk factors in each of three weight cat-

egories, normal, overweight, and obese (Table 4). There was
no significant difference between the two countries in the
frequency in which a specific number of abnormalities ap-
peared at a given weight category. Importantly, the frequen-
cies of MetS in US and Korean obese adolescents were 20.8
±6.2% and 24.3±6.4%, respectively. The prevalence of
MetS in the obese groups was more than 20 times that of the
normal weight groups, and about four times higher than
the overweight groups in both countries. The frequency of
abdominal obesity in the US was significantly higher than
in Korea in all three weight categories (overall P<0.05). The
frequencies of hyperglycemia and a low HDL-C level did not
show a difference overall between the two countries, but there
was more than twice the prevalence of hyperglycemia (both,
P<0.05) in the US and low HDL-C level (both, P<0.001) in
Korea in the normal and overweight groups. Thirty-seven
percent of normal weight Korean adolescents had low HDL-
C levels compared to 14.0% in normal weight US adoles-
cents. The frequency of high blood pressure was significant-
ly higher in normal weight Korean adolescents than in US
normal weight adolescents (P<0.05). The frequency of hyper-
triglyceridemia did not differ between the two countries in
all weight categories.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the new
IDF pediatric definitions of MetS to Korean adolescents. In
this study, the prevalences of MetS and obesity in US adoles-
cents were 5.5% and 18.1%, respectively, which were appro-
ximately double the corresponding prevalences (2.5% and
9.0%) in Korean adolescents, confirming our first hypothe-
sis. Despite lifestyle changes such as an increase in energy
intake and a decrease in physical activity due to rapid eco-
nomic development and the introduction of western culture
in Korea, the MetS and obesity in US adolescents is still a
greater problem than in Korean adolescents. Our study can-
not assert that race itself confers an additional risk beyond
cultural and environmental factors; therefore, a comprehen-
sive comparison investigating the relative contribution of
genetic, cultural, and environmental factors is needed.
The overall prevalence of abdominal obesity in US adoles-
cents in our study was over four times higher (34.7%) than
that of Koreans (8.4%); however, the abdominal obesity preva-
lence in US and Korean obese adolescents was much closer
(87.7% vs. 64.9%, respectively). In both countries, the abdom-
inal obesity prevalence was also found to be the most com-
mon of the MetS criteria in adolescents in the highest BMI
category. Therefore, obese adolescents with abdominal obe-
sity should be an important target for intervention in both
countries.
The difference between the prevalence of abdominal obesi-
ty in US and Korean females was much greater than in males.
Although the differences were not as marked, the opposite
trend was seen when assessing obesity by BMI criterion as a
larger difference existed between US and Korean males than
females. This dichotomy is not easy to explain. Although fat
and muscle mass distribution vary according to pubertal sta-
tus and gender, neither the US NHANES nor KNHANES
assessed pubertal status. Possible explanations are a gender-
variable genetic predisposition to the accumulation of viscer-
al fat which contributes to abdominal obesity or to the use
of inappropriate cutoff values for abdominal and overall obe-
sity by BMI. The visceral fat contribution to total body fat
as well as pubertal status would be informative additions to
future national surveys, in order that that more detailed hy-
potheses can be made. Current Korean growth charts include

WC while US growth charts do not. Increased awareness of
the dangers of abdominal obesity could be facilitated by add-
ing WC to the other growth charts used in the US.
The prevalence of hyperglycemia in US adolescents (11.8%)
was nearly four times higher than in Koreans (3.0%), but in
both countries the prevalence was the lowest for any of the
components of MetS. The higher prevalence of hyperglycemia
in US adolescents may be associated with their higher preva-
lence of obesity. It is known that Asian children have a much
greater risk for type 2 diabetes at a relatively low BMI owing
to their greater abdominal fat distribution compared with
Caucasian children (16). However, our study showed a lower
prevalence of hyperglycemia in Korea than in the US in obese
adolescents. Importantly, neither NHANES nor KNHANES
distinguished between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Typically,
a significant percentage of all pediatric diabetics are type 1 (17).
Hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C levels are often found
together (18). Our study showed a higher prevalence of hyper-
triglyceridemia in the US but a higher prevalence of low
HDL-C in Korea. Various risk factors for hypertriglyceride-
mia such as diabetes, obesity, alcohol intake, and a high car-
bohydrate diet have been reported (19). Increasing preva-
lences of hypertriglyceridemia and obesity in the US popu-
lation during the period from 1971-2000 may be a result of
a shift in consumption from a high fat to a high carbohydrate
diet (20). Although little information exists to explain the
low HDL-C status in Korean adolescents, we assume adult
factors such as obesity, low levels of physical activity, high
intakes of carbohydrate and fat, snacks, and processed foods,
as well as genetics are implicated (21). Obesity is related to
many types of lipid disorders (8, 22), which can help explain
the higher prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia in the US over-
all as well as similar prevalences in the two countries among
obese adolescents. Decreased levels of HDL-C in adolescents
have been associated with puberty, particularly in males who
experience a surge of testosterone (23). Since Tanner staging
was not done in either NHANES, it is difficult to determine
whether the HDL-C levels were affected by differences in
pubertal development in the two countries. Higher LDL-
C:HDL-C and TC:HDL-C ratios in Korean adolescents result-
ing from lower HDL-C and higher LDL-C of Koreans sug-
gest that they have a more unfavorable lipid profile than their
US counterparts. These results may indicate an elevated risk
for CVD among this cohort of Korean adolescents. Further
study is needed to understand the differences in patterns of
dyslipidemia between the two countries and long-term con-
sequences.
In our study, the overall prevalence of high blood pressure
did not differ significantly between the two countries; how-
ever, US adolescents had higher pulse pressures than Korean
adolescents. Elevated pulse pressure is positively associated
with obesity (24); thus, higher pulse pressures in US adoles-
cents may be related to their higher BMI relative to Korean
adolescents. Anticipating a rise in the prevalences of CVD in
young adults, Healthy People 2010 emphasized the need to
monitor and manage high blood pressure in adolescents (25).
Some authors have suggested that high blood pressure in
childhood and adolescence correlates with insulin level and
insulin resistance (26) although inclusion of blood pressure
as a component of pediatric MetS is still controversial. If a
measurement of insulin levels is added to the KNHANES,
the relationship between insulin levels and blood pressure
in the two countries can be assessed.
Consensus adolescent MetS criteria have been unavailable
until recently, and thus MetS prevalence estimates vary con-
siderably. In US adolescents aged 12-19 yr, the prevalence
of MetS varied from 2.0-9.6% in recent NHANES studies
(16, 20). Some studies showed that the overall prevalence of
MetS in US adolescents was increasing over time (6, 27). On
the contrary, Ford et al. (5) reported that the prevalence of
MetS in adolescents aged 12-17 was relatively stable across
a 6-yr period with 4.5% for 1999-2000, 4.4-4.5% for 2001-
2002, and 3.7-3.9% for 2003-4 NHANES using the 2007
IDF definition. The prevalence of the MetS in the US was
higher in our study (5.5%) than in Ford et al. (5) report pos-
sibly due to differences in the age range studied. In Korea,
there were two studies reporting that the overall prevalence
of MetS increased from 6.8% in the 1998 KNHANES to
9.2% in the 2001 KNHANES using the criteria used by
Cook et al. (7). The prevalence of MetS in males increased
from 5.7% in the 1998 KNHANES to 9.0% in the 2001
KNHANES while there was no increase in females (5.1%
in 1998 and 4.9% in 2001) in the age range 10-19 yr using
the NCEP-ATP III-derived definition (28). These differences
should be taken into account when making comparisons with
these previous studies. Likewise, caution should be used when
comparing the prevalence of obesity in our study with previ-
ous reports due to the utilization of different age ranges or
obesity criteria. A US report showed that the prevalence of
obesity among adolescents aged 12-19 yr increased from 14.8%
in 1999-2000 NHANES to 16.7% in 2001-2 NHANES
and to 17.4% in 2003-4 NHANES using 2000 US Growth
Charts (29). A Korean report indicates that the prevalence
of obesity in the10-18 yr old population increased signifi-
cantly from 5.4% in the 1998 KNHANES to 11.3% in the
2001 KNHANES using 2000 US Growth Charts (8). The
Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
reported that the prevalence of obesity in adolescents nearly
doubled from 8.7% in 1998 to 16.0% in 2005 (30) based
on 1998 Korean Growth Charts. Previous studies demon-
strated the increasing prevalences of obesity in US (29) and
Korean (8, 30) adolescents, and it is expected that the preva-
lence of obesity in both countries will continue to be high
despite public health interventions. The trend in the preva-
lence of adolescent MetS remains controversial (5, 7, 27, 28).
We expect that if the prevalence of obesity decreases in both
countries, prevalences of MetS will decrease as well. However,
the risk factors for MetS and obesity are not identical, and
80 J. Park, D.C. Hilmers, J.A. Mendoza, et al.
the mechanisms underlying the development of MetS are not
fully understood. The frequencies of adolescents having at
least one component of MetS in the obese, overweight, and
normal weight categories were 94.8%, 78.4%, and 35.3%,
respectively in the US, and 79.4%, 72.3%, and 43.6%, res-
pectively in Korea. These findings imply that even adoles-
cents with normal weight should not be excluded from screen-
ing for MetS.
As predicted by our second hypothesis, the most prevalent
abnormality in each country was also different: abdominal
obesity in the US and low HDL-C levels in Korea. Prevalences
of abdominal obesity, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceride-
mia were higher in the US while the prevalence of low HDL-
C was higher in Korea. Unlike obesity, systematic public
health programs to combat pediatric MetS in each country
have not been emphasized. Further research to gain a better
understanding of the genetic and environmental factors res-
ponsible for these differences is needed, and nation-specific
strategies such as school-based health examinations and lipid
screening should be established.
One notable finding is that despite the higher prevalence
of MetS and obesity in the US, the prevalence of MetS in
obese US and Korean adolescents did not significantly differ
(20.8% and 24.3%, respectively). The number of metabolic
abnormalities by BMI percentiles also showed no difference
between the two countries. A number of studies have report-
ed high prevalences of MetS among obese adolescents in the
US (12.4-44.2%) (2, 7, 27) and Korea (33.3-64.3%) (8). In
agreement with our findings, these studies also reported that
the prevalence of MetS in obese adolescents did not largely
differ between the two countries although Koreans had a lower
BMI and obesity prevalence overall. These results imply that
obese adolescents have a similar risk of MetS regardless of
nationality and that the ethnic specific cut-points used in
this study for the MetS criteria appropriately identified the
risk of MetS across multiple ethnicities.
Our study had some limitations. First, we cannot identify
the extent by which country-specific cut-off points for obe-
sity and abdominal obesity affect the prevalence of MetS in
each country. Second, while both surveys used similar anthro-
pometric and laboratory methods, each survey used its own
reference laboratories to analyze the samples and instruments,
which may contribute to differences in results between coun-
tries. Third, only subjects who had fasted at least 8 hr prior
to the blood collection were included in the study. Fourth,
participants were excluded if any of the five components of
MetS were not measured, which limited our sample size. Final-
ly, Tanner staging was not available which could confound
the results, particularly in younger adolescents.
In summary, our study compared MetS and its components
in US and Korean adolescents using the 2007 IDF definition,
the first international pediatric criteria. As we hypothesized,
US adolescents had nearly twice the prevalence of both MetS
and obesity. There were also differences in the prevalence of
individual abnormalities and the most prevalent abnormali-
ty in each country. The prevalence of MetS in both countries
was similar among obese adolescents, a finding that suggests
that obese adolescents, regardless of ethnicity, have a similar
risk for MetS and that ethnic-specific criteria for defining MetS,
such as the IDF definition, may be most appropriate. Early-
screening and focused interventions for MetS and obesity
should be priorities in public health planning in both coun-
tries. Concomitantly, further research should be undertaken
to investigate the various genetic, cultural, and environmen-
tal factors underlying the differences between the two coun-
tries.
