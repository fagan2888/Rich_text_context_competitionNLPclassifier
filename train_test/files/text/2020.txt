Essential hypertension is a multifactorial condition, the sus-
ceptibility and severity of which are influenced by genetic
variation.1 The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays
major roles in blood pressure regulation through the renin­
angiotensin­aldosterone and the kinin­kallikrein systems.
ACE catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin
II, a potent vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-stimulating pep-
tide that controls blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte balance.
ACE also degrades bradykinin, which is a strong vasodilator.
Consequently, the ACE gene has been implicated in the patho-
genesis of hypertension. A common variant in this gene known
as the insertion/deletion (I/D) variant­rs4646994­is defined by
the presence or absence of a 287­289 base pair Alu-type repeat
sequence in intron 16. This polymorphism has been shown to
account for upwards of 50% of the interindividual variation in
serum ACE activity,2,3 with significantly higher plasma ACE
levels4,5 and tissue ACE mRNA expression6,7 in carriers of the D
allele or DD genotype. Detailed analyses of the ACE locus have
identified other variants tightly linked to the I/D polymorphism
that may be responsible for these findings.8,9 Nevertheless, the
I/D variant (which also has NCBI ref. single-nucleotide poly-
morphism identifiers rs4340, rs1799752, and rs13447447) has
remained one of the most studied genetic markers in relation to
blood pressure and essential hypertension in humans.
In genome-wide linkage scans, the chromosomal region
that contains the ACE gene is, by far, the region to most

Background
The insertion/deletion (I/D) variant (rs4646994) of the angiotensin
I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is one of the most studied
polymorphisms in relation to blood pressure and essential
hypertension in humans.The evidence to date, however, on an
association of this variant with blood pressure-related outcomes
has been inconclusive.
Methods
We examined 5,561 participants of theThird National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a population-based and
nationally representative survey of the United States, who were
20 years of age and who self-identified as non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, or Mexican American.Within each race/ethnicity, we
assessed genetic associations of the I/D variant with systolic blood
pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and hypertension, as
well as genotype­sex interactions, in four genetic models (additive,
dominant, recessive, and codominant).
Results
The frequency of the I/D variant differed significantly by race/
ethnicity (P = 0.001). Among non-Hispanic blacks, the D allele was
significantly associated (P < 0.05) with increased SBP in additive
and dominant covariate-adjusted models and was also associated
with increased DBP in dominant models when participants
taking ACE inhibitors were excluded from the analyses. No other
significant associations were observed in any race/ethnic group.
Significant genotype­sex interactions were detected among
Mexican Americans, for whom positive associations with SBP and
hypertension were seen among females, but not males.
Conclusions
This study gives limited support for association of the ACE I/D variant
with blood pressure and for sex-specific effects among particular
race/ethnic groups, though we cannot rule out the role of genetic or
environmental interactions.

consistently show linkage across studies to blood pressure
or 
hypertension.10 Hundreds of candidate gene association

studies have also been performed, though meta-analyses have
found little evidence for an association between the I/D vari-
ant and either outcome using data largely from white popula-
tions in Europe and the United States.4,5 However, a significant
association between the I/D variant and hypertension was
found among Han Chinese through recent meta-analysis.11
Interestingly, data from genome-wide association studies
do not seem to support a role in blood pressure variation or
hypertension for regions in or near the ACE gene,10,12 though
many studies may have been hampered by inadequate marker
coverage of this locus.10,13 Therefore, there continues to be
uncertainty regarding association between the I/D variant and
blood pressure or susceptibility to hypertension. There are also
reports of gender-specific effects of the ACE gene on blood
pressure or hypertension in mice and humans,10 with signifi-
cant associations of the DD genotype reported either only in
women5 or in men.14,15
In light of this evidence, we studied the ACE I/D variant in
a large population-based and nationally representative sample
of adults in the United States. We assessed the association of
the I/D variant with blood pressure and with hypertension and
also examined gene­sex interactions in each of the three major
race/ethnic groups in the United States.
Methods
Study population. The Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) is a population-based and
nationally representative survey of the civilian, noninstitution-
alized population of the United States aged 2 months or older
that was conducted from 1988 to 1994.16 The survey relied
on a multistage, complex survey design and included four
self-identified race/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic white, non-

Hispanic black, Mexican American, and "other." A DNA bank
was created that contains specimens from 7,159 participants
aged 12 years or older that were collected from phase 2 of the
survey (1991­1994).17 The characteristics of the participants
included in the DNA bank have been described.18
Current analyses were limited to DNA samples of partici-
pants aged 20 years or older (n = 5,948). Pregnant women
(n = 111) and persons in the "other" race/ethnic group
(n = 276) were then excluded. The final sample size is 5,561,
which includes 2,340 non-Hispanic whites, 1,588 non-His-
panic blacks, and 1,633 Mexican Americans. This study was
approved by the Research Ethics Review Board of the National
Center for Health Statistics at CDC.
Genotyping and quality control methods. The ACE I/D poly-
morphism was genotyped by capillary fragment analysis18
by laboratory staff who were blinded to the phenotypic data
of the study participants. The variant passed quality control
criteria as defined by National Center for Health Statistics17
and genotype frequencies did not significantly deviate from
Hardy­Weinberg proportions (at P value 0.01) in any of the
three race/ethnic groups.18
Measurements and definitions. Blood pressure was measured
at the household interview by a trained interviewer and at
the Medical Examination Center by the examining physician
(a maximum of three measurements at each location). Up to
six measurements were obtained, each separated by 5min
of rest, with the participant in the sitting position using a
standard mercury sphygmomanometer. The arithmetic mean
of these measurements was used to determine the aver-
age systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the average diastolic
blood pressure (DBP) for each participant.19 Hypertension
was defined as SBP 140mm Hg, DBP 90mm Hg, or if the
participant was currently taking prescribed medicine for
hypertension.
Several additional variables were used to characterize study
participants and were included in multivariable-adjusted anal-
yses. Age was categorized as 20­49 years or 50 years. Body
mass index was classified into four categories (<18.5, 18.5­
<25.0, 25.0­<30.0, and 30.0kg/m2). Diabetes was defined
by self-report or by the presence of hemoglobin A1c
levels
6.5%.20 Current use of glucose-lowering medication was cap-
tured by participants who answered "yes" to the self-report
question. Fasting plasma glucose was not included in the dia-
betes definition since this measurement was not available for
all participants. Women with only a history of gestational dia-
betes were not considered diabetic. Other reported variables
include educational attainment and smoking status (as catego-
rized in Table 1).
Statistical analysis. All analyses were performed using SAS-
Callable SUDAAN 10 (Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, NC) and SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)
to account for the NHANES III complex sampling design.
Nationally representative estimates were calculated using
sample weights for the NHANES III DNA bank as previously
described.18 Standard errors and confidence intervals were cal-
culated using the Taylor series linearization approach21,22 to
correct for correlations within sampled clusters, including the
possible genetic relatedness of persons sampled from the same
household.
Genotype frequencies were calculated as previously
described.18 Genetic associations were assessed separately
in each race/ethnic group in crude and adjusted linear
regression models (for SBP and DBP) and logistic regres-
sion models (for hypertension). Analyses were performed
by examining four possible modes of inheritance: additive
(per D allele), dominant ((DD+ID) vs. II), recessive (DD
vs. (ID+II)), and codominant (DD vs. ID vs. II). Age-sex
adjusted and fully adjusted regression models were run for
each outcome. Inclusion of covariates into multivariable
models was determined by significant association (P < 0.05)
of the variable with the outcome in nongenetic univariate
models in at least one of the race/ethnicities. Beta-coefficients
and prevalence odds ratios, along with 95% confidence inter-
vals, were estimated from the regression models. Differences
in effects between men and women were estimated and tested
by including genotype × sex interaction terms in the models.

Main effect and genotype­sex interaction analyses were also
performed on the subset of participants who were not tak-
ing ACE inhibitor medication at the time of the survey (n =
5,280). All associations (descriptive and genetic) were tested
at the threshold of 0.05 using the Satterthwaite-adjusted
F-statistic, a conservative and preferred test statistic for the
analysis of complex survey data.23
Statistical power to detect genetic associations within each
race/ethnic group was calculated using a two-sided  set at
0.05 and assuming a design effect of 1.2. Minimum detect-
able effect sizes given 80% power were calculated for additive,
dominant, and recessive models.
Results
Basic demographic and clinical characteristics of the par-
ticipants are displayed in Table 1. All listed demographic
variables differed significantly by race/ethnicity (P < 0.05).
Mexican Americans had a larger proportion of males and
fewer older adults (50 years) than non-Hispanic whites or
non-Hispanic blacks. Mean body mass index was highest
among non-Hispanic blacks, who also displayed the greatest
prevalences of diabetes and hypertension (P < 0.001 for all).
The use of any antihypertension medication differed signifi-
cantly by race/ethnicity (P < 0.001; data not shown), whereas

or 4.18% of the total study population) was borderline

significant across race/ethnicities (P = 0.051, Table 1).
The frequencies of the I/D variant in each race/ethnic
group are almost identical to prevalence estimates that were
previously published for the entire NHANES III DNA bank
(12 years old).18 Genotype prevalence varied significantly
by race/ethnicity (P = 0.001, Table 1), with the prevalence
of the DD genotype lowest among Mexican Americans and
highest among non-Hispanic blacks. Within each race/ethnic
group, the distributions of the three genotypes did not dif-
fer by sex, by age, by ACE inhibitor use, or by diabetes status
(data not shown), nor did the distribution differ among those
with and without hypertension (Figure 1). Since some stud-
ies have noted a sex-specific association of the I/D variant with
hypertension, we examined the prevalence of I/D according
to hypertension status among males and females separately
within each race/ethnicity. We found no differences in geno-
type prevalence between those with and without hypertension
among males or females who identified as non-Hispanic white
or non-Hispanic black. However, Mexican American females
with hypertension displayed a significantly different distri-
bution of genotype frequencies compared to those without
hypertension (P = 0.024; Figure 1). There was no such differ-
ence identified among Mexican American males.
To assess the contribution of the I/D variant to blood pres-
sure variability and to the prevalence of hypertension in the
US population, we examined regression models separately for
each racial/ethnic group. The D allele was significantly associ-
ated (P < 0.05) with an increase in SBP among non-Hispanic
blacks in both age-sex and fully adjusted dominant models
(Table 2) and additive models (Supplementary Table S1).
There were no significant findings among non-Hispanic whites
or Mexican Americans for SBP under any genetic model
(Table 2 and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The main
effect of the I/D variant was also not significantly associated
with DBP or hypertension in any race/ethnic group (Table 2
and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), though the associa-
tion with DBP was marginally significant (P  0.063) in non-
Hispanic blacks under dominant models (Table 2). Though the
associations were not statistically significant in most 
models,
the direction of the effect was generally positive (associated
with greater odds of hypertension or with higher SBP and
DBP) among non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans,
whereas the associations trended toward lower SBP, DBP, and
odds of hypertension among non-Hispanic whites (Table 2
and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Results were not materially different when participants
taking ACE inhibitors were excluded from all analyses, with
one notable exception. In non-Hispanic blacks, the asso-
ciation of the I/D variant with DBP in dominant models
became statistically significant (crude:  (95% confidence
interval) = 1.74 (0.10, 3.38), P = 0.038; age-sex adjusted: 1.69
(0.08, 3.31), P = 0.041; fully adjusted: 1.69 (0.02, 3.35), P =
0.047) (data not shown).
Because sex-specific associations of the I/D variant with
blood pressure or hypertension have been reported, we

formally tested for the presence of genotype­sex interac-
tions. In codominant and recessive models, there were no
significant genotype­sex interactions detected in any race/
ethnicity for any outcome (data not shown). Among Mexican
Americans, significant interactions (P < 0.05) were detected
in additive and/or dominant models of SBP and hyperten-
sion (Table 3), but not for DBP (data not shown). In these
analyses, a significant association of the I/D variant with
SBP was found among women but not men in an age-sex
adjusted additive model (P = 0.009 for the interaction). The
I/D variant was also significantly associated with increased
odds of hypertension in females in both age-sex and fully
adjusted additive and dominant models, but showed no sig-
nificant association among Mexican American males (P <
0.05 for the interactions, Table 3). Results were very similar
in analyses that excluded participants taking ACE inhibitors
(data not shown).

group, additive models were best powered to detect genetic

associations (Supplementary Table S3). For SBP among non-
Hispanic blacks­the only group for which we found statisti-
cally significant findings­our study had 80% power to detect a
beta-coefficient as small as 2.19 for the additive model and 4.04
for the dominant model. Our study was best powered (i.e., the
minimum detectable beta coefficients were smallest) to detect
associations with SBP among non-Hispanic blacks compared
with the other two race/ethnic groups. For hypertension, we not
only calculated the smallest detectable odds ratio assuming 80%
power, but we also calculated our power assuming an odds ratio
of 1.3, which is indicative of effects found in candidate gene
studies24 and in genome-wide association studies.25 Under this
scenario, additive models were adequately powered (93, 86, and
68% among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and
Mexican Americans, respectively), whereas 
dominant models
had modest power (33­50% across race/
ethnic groups).
Discussion
Our study demonstrated no association of the common ACE
I/D variant with hypertension in any of the three main race/
ethnic groups in the United States, a finding that is in line with
many other studies (reviewed in ref. 10). We also tested the
association of the variant with its two component phenotypes.
Two general findings were significant: among non-Hispanic
blacks, the D allele and its association with increased SBP (in
age-sex and fully adjusted dominant and additive models) and
with increased DBP in dominant models (only when partici-
pants taking ACE inhibitors were excluded). Of note, the most
recently published meta-analysis of studies in white individuals
found that blood pressure was not associated with I/D genotype,
though this analysis is now outdated.4 The significant results in
non-Hispanic blacks may need to be interpreted cautiously, as
we did not correct for multiple testing since we included only

for non-Hispanic whites compared with non-Hispanic blacks
and Mexican Americans, though very few associations reached
statistical significance. This may reflect unknown allelic hetero-
geneity or gene­environment interactions.
Sex-specific effects of the I/D variant have been noted in
various populations,5,14,15 though we found evidence of a gen-
otype­sex interaction in only one race/ethnic group. Indeed,
while no association of the I/D variant with blood pressure
or hypertension was found in the total Mexican American
population, we detected such associations among Mexican
American females. This finding may also be a consequence of
interactions with environmental or phenotypic factors.10
The functional significance of the I/D variant has been dem-
onstrated in multiple studies,2­7 though other tightly linked
polymorphisms may be responsible for these findings.8,9 Serum
ACE levels were not measured in NHANES III, so we were
unable to examine the association between I/D genotypes and
ACE enzyme levels or activity. The only genome-wide asso-
ciation study to examine genomic loci for serum ACE activity
found eight ACE polymorphisms significantly associated, of
which only rs4343 was moved forward into further analyses.26
The authors found that rs4343 accounted for 16.2% of the total
variance in serum ACE activity among the study participants
(1,023 hypertensive patients) after adjustment for age, gender,
and ACE inhibitor medication use. Though the authors26 did
not list the other significantly associated ACE variants, prior
research has indicated a high amount of linkage disequilib-
rium between rs4343 and the I/D variant (D 0.95 or r2 ~0.90)
in individuals of European or African descent.27­29 Of note, a
recent meta-analysis of four studies found a significant asso-
ciation between rs4343 and hypertension among some race/
ethnic groups (Gulf Arabs and Pakistanis combined), but not
others (Han Chinese).30
Our study has several limitations. First, NHANES are cross-
sectional surveys, so we could not evaluate hypertension
incidence. In addition, we were unable to assess population
stratification, as data from ancestry-informative markers are
not yet available for NHANES III. However, our large sam-
ple size allowed for separate analyses within each major race/
ethnic group, self-reported designations shown to correspond
with ancestry as derived from ancestry-informative markers
for these populations.31­33 Race/ethnicity-stratified analy-
ses enabled us to account, at least partially, for differences
in: blood pressure distribution and hypertension prevalence;
genotype prevalence; and linkage disequilibrium patterns
between race/ethnicities. Nevertheless, we cannot overlook
that there may be residual population substructure that may
have affected our results. This may be particularly true for
Mexican Americans, in whom we detected sex-specific effects
though we were least powered to do so. Our study strengths
include the large sample size, the availability of detailed infor-
mation on a number of potential confounders, and the pop-
ulation-based representation of the three major race/ethnic
groups in the United States.
We did not examine potential interactions with environ-
mental factors such as sodium intake, which was assessed in
NHANES III by a single 24-h dietary recall. Dietary assess-
ment methods have poor correlation to the 24-h urine col-
lection,34 which is often used as an external measure to assess
the validity of dietary evaluation.35 In addition, 24-h dietary
recalls have poorer correlations both with long-term sodium
intake and with within-subject repeat measures compared to
24-h urine samples.34 There were no urinary sodium excretion
measurements performed in NHANES III that could validate
a self-reported 24-h dietary intake.
Overall, the lack of consensus on the effect of the I/D vari-
ant on hypertension-related traits is likely due to a combina-
tion of factors. First, examining the I/D variant in isolation may
mask any effects, as interaction with other loci are probably
important, including loci in non-ACE and nonrenin pathways
that are capable of producing angiotensin II. However, hyper-
tension-associated variants such as those in angiotensinogen
(AGT),11,36 -adducin (ADD1),37,38 or aldosterone synthase
(CYP11B2)39 have not yet been genotyped in NHANES III.
Also, the I/D variant is possibly a marker for true functional
polymorphism(s) in the ACE locus. No other ACE variants were
genotyped in NHANES III, so we could not examine the gene
in greater detail. Conversely, it is possible that common genetic
variation (compared to rare alleles) in such classic pathways as
the renin­angiotensin system does not play a significant role in
blood pressure regulation or in the etiology of hypertension.40
In conclusion, we found minimal evidence for associations
or for sex-specific effects of the ACE I/D polymorphism with
blood pressure variation or with hypertension in United States
adults, though interactions with other genes or environmental
factors cannot be discounted.
