Introduction
With the advent of the Internet, students not only can go to
school to listen to live lectures but are also able to develop
skills through Internet platforms. In other words, learning via
the Internet can enhance studying efficiency. Everyone has
access to knowledge more than ever before through the
Internet. In addition, E-learning is accessible from any loca-
tion. The Internet, computers, satellite broadcasting, audio
and videotapes, interactive television and CDs are all exam-
ples of multimedia. Moreover, we can learn about a wide
range of topics through the Internet and are not limited by
physical constraints, such as the need to cram schools and
classrooms with students, and so on.
Tsai (2009) has developed courseware for semiconductor
technology that overcomes problems encountered in devel-
oping English Special Programs (ESP) in Taiwan. In the
design of the courseware, five skills for learning English (lis-
tening, speaking, reading, writing, and translation) have been
considered and a 3D multimedia technique has been used to
promote learning interest, student engagement, and effi-
ciency. Students report they have benefited from the course-
wareimplementation.Theyreportthatthemultimedia-assisted
environment promotes learning effectiveness (Sihar, Hj Ab
Aziz, & Sulaiman, 2011).
Taiwan has an extremely competitive infrastructure for
information and communication technology. West (2005)
ranked it 1st in e-government, while Waseda University
ranked it 7th (Waseda University of e-Government, 2006). In
terms of promoting digital business and Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) services, the Economist
Intelligence Unit (2009) ranked Taiwan 16th (Tao, 2008).
The Internet and computers are becoming a part of daily
life for Taiwanese college students. E-learning supplies high-
speed access to knowledge and information. According to a
study by the Bank of Taiwan, 67.4% of people are willing to
use E-learning, rather than going to school or reading books,
to complete learning activities; the convenience of the
Internet is most attractive to them. However, only 40.4% of
people have had E-learning experience. Thus, we can con-
clude the Internet is very common in Taiwan and has many
benefits. We still have many obstacles to overcome in
increasing the rate of E-learning usage. Therefore, the goal

Applying the UTAUT to Understand
Factors Affecting the Use of English
E-Learning Websites in Taiwan
Paul Juinn Bing Tan1
Abstract
The evolution of the Internet diminishes learning's limits on time and location and attracts more and more students to learning
websites or online learning environments to pursue their chosen studies. The purpose of this study is to explore Taiwanese
college students' needs for English E-learning websites. Accordingly, this paper uses the unified theory of acceptance and
use of technology to investigate and explain Taiwanese college students' acceptance of English E-learning websites. After
analysis, the results demonstrate that performance expectations, effort expectancy, and social influence have positive effects
on behavior intentions and facilitating conditions; behavioral intentions also have positive effects on use behavior. Overall,
if students believe that English E-learning websites can help them increase their performance and that they are easy to use,
there is an increase in their intention to use them. This suggests that web designers should improve knowledge management
functions and improve user interfaces to be easier to operate.

of this study is to understand the decisions affecting choices
of English E-learning websites. The research results may be
utilized in future English E-learning website service devel-
opment suggestions, and to improve usability and adaptabil-
ity. Although this research is based on Taiwanese college
students, the results should be relevant to other language
learners.
We attempted to explore Taiwanese college students'
intentions to use English E-learning websites. The unified
theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model
was used to assess the technological and value issues and
thus obtain an understanding of Taiwanese college students'
decisions to use English E-learning website services.
Based on these facts, this study aims to focus on three
objectives:
·
· To identify the influence of the UTAUT factors on the
adoption of English E-learning websites.
·
· To understand college students' needs for English
E-learning websites in Taiwan.
·
· To understand the influence of online English
E-learning on students' behavior in Taiwan.
Literature review
E-Learning
E-learning is changing the way education is implemented
and perceived. Schools can take advantage of this technol-
ogy to make learning faster, cheaper, and more effective.
These types of improvements are especially appealing to cor-
porations. Corporate executives have begun to recognize that
high-quality training creates long-term competitive advan-
tages. They increasingly realize that effective education's
strategic benefits can outweigh its costs. (Hambrect and Co,
2001)
With the rapid growth of e-learning, a technological revo-
lution is currently taking place in institutions of higher learn-
ing (Sihar et al., 2011). E-learning is a learner-centered
educational system that enables learners to learn whenever,
wherever, and whatever they wish, according to their learn-
ing objectives (Rosenberg, 2001).
The organizational structure of learning should be consis-
tent with knowledge management practices in schools. In
addition to social interaction among teachers, it is necessary
to facilitate resource management (e.g., time and space shar-
ing) that contributes to teaching and learning because it pro-
vides an environment where knowledge management
practices take place. For example, schools need to consider
what types of IT resources are important to develop physical
and online environments for sharing and whether teachers
are able to use them effectively (Leung, 2010).
As research observes, however, the use of technology has
positive performance effects when learning foreign lan-
guages and also improves students' motivation.
Definition of E-learning.E-learning is also called computer-
assisted instruction, Web-based learning, distributed learn-
ing, online learning, or Internet-based learning. There are
two E-learning modes. The first is computer-assisted instruc-
tion, which uses computers to aid in the delivery of stand-
alone multimedia packages for teaching and learning. The
second mode is distance learning, which uses information
technologies to deliver instruction to remote learners from a
central site.
A traditional approach is a face-to-face approach, which
is similar to Osborn's definition. An electronic approach may
incorporate teleconferencing, chat rooms, or discussion
boards. Instant messaging is a most common communication
channel on the web, through such famous services like
Microsoft MSN, Yahoo Messenger and Skype (Lin, 2009).
E-learning is becoming a major component in academia
today.There is a need for formalized guidelines in E-Learning
that instruct the designer (course instructor) on how to
design, maintain, and manage a course. There are a wide
variety of E-learning systems available on the market.
Content available web learning is variable: some of it is
excellent, but much is mediocre. The needs of content devel-
opers, educators, and students cannot be addressed through
many available E-learning services; there are gaps that need
to be addressed (Jayanthi, Srivatsa, & Ramesh, 2007).
Benefit of E-learning.Communication technologies such as
the Internet are creating abundant opportunities to facilitate
learning (Wang, 2008). One drawback may be that learners
must be more responsible for themselves in E-learning envi-
ronments. However, this also provides more opportunities
for learners to choose their own directions and set their own
pace. Systems can also provide materials that are fine-tuned
to users' needs.
As .NET framework-specific distributed technology,
.NET remoting is not designed to provide interoperability or
crossing trust boundaries to third-party clients. On the other
hand, .NET remoting provides faster communication speed
over internal networks. (Amirian & Alesheikh, 2008).
Chen and Tsai (2011) conducted a study regarding Virtual
Classroom development, providing several strategies for
building up prospective e-classroom districts or schools.
In December 2009, another study evaluated three
E-learning systems in Iran that have been used in well-known
universities: the Iran University of Science and Technology
(IUST), the AmirKabir University of Technology (AUT),
and the Virtual University of Shiraz (SVU), all of which are
located in Tehran. All of these universities provided high-
quality E-learning systems for students and have collected
some information regarding the systems' performance
through interviews with students and staff (Etaati, Sadi-
Nezhad, & Makue, 2011).
Empirical studies have applied media psychology to
examine esthetic-emotion items, treated as adjectives associ-
ated with the two motivational models (MMs) developed by
Tan 3
Keller, Malone, and Lepper, which are suited for formal and
informal visual environments, respectively. Exploratory fac-
tor analysis (EFA) has been performed on aesthetic-emotion
items in two studies to develop a scale to measure learners'
motivation (Riaz, Rambli, Salleh, & Mushtaq, 2011).
Furthermore, the expanding multimedia capabilities of
new technologies provide vast opportunities to engage and
motivate learners.
Table 1 shows the comparisons between traditional class-
room learning and E-learning.
Adoption Theories
A wide body of research focuses on identifying factors
affecting people's intentions to use new technologies and
how these intentions predict actual usage (Davis, Bagozzi, &
Warshaw, 1989). The following sections summarize some of
the major theories.
Innovation diffusion theory (IDT). IDT seeks to explain the
process by which users adapt technological advances
(Rogers, 1995; Figure 1). The theory's core constructs and
definitions are shown in Table 2. Since the 1960s, it has
been applied to the study of topics as diverse as agricul-
tural tools and organizational innovation (Tornatzky &
Klein, 1982). The five factors from this model along with
two additional factors introduced by Moore and Benbasat
(1991) were adapted to information system innovations
(Table 3; Figure 2).
Theory of reasoned action (TRA). The TRA is a fundamental
model that was created by social psychologists to study con-
scious intentional behavior (Fishbein, & Ajzen, 1975; Figure
3). It has been incredibly influential and applied to a wide
variety of behavior (Sheppard, Hartwick, & Warshaw, 1988).
Davis et al. (1989) used it to study acceptance of new tech-
nologies and obtained results that were consistent with previ-
ous studies of other behavior. The core constructs and
definitions are shown in Table 4.
Theory of planned behavior (TPB).TPB expanded TRA with
the concept of "perceived behavioral control" (Table 5).
Ajzen (1991) reviewed studies that used TPB successfully
for a wide range of intentions and behaviors (Figure 4). It has
been effective in predicting acceptance and use of many dif-
ferent technologies (Harrison, Mykytyn, & Riemenschnei-
der, 1997).
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Extended TAM
(TAM2). TAM was designed to predict information technol-
ogy acceptance and usage related to labor (Figure 5). Unlike
TRA, the final conception of TAM does not include the atti-
tude construct; this is to better explain intention parsimoni-
ously. TAM has been widely applied to a diverse set of
technologies and users (Table 6).
TAM2 enlarged TAM by including "subjective norm" as
an additional predictor of intention in the case of mandatory
settings (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000; Figure 6). It is modified
from TAM and includes more variables (Table 7).
CombinedTAM andTPB (C-TAM-TPB). C-TAM-TPB combines
the predictors of TPB with perceived usefulness from TAM
to supply a hybrid model (Taylor & Todd, 1995; Table 8;
Figure 7)
Social cognitive theory (SCT). SCT is one of the most compre-
hensive theories of human behavior (Bandura, 1986).

Compeau and Higgins (1995) extended and applied SCT to
the context of computer utilization (Table 9).
Model of Personal Computing (PC) utilization (MPCU).Derived
largely from a theory of human behavior, this model presents
a competing perspective to those proposed by TRA and TPB
(Table 10). Thompson, Higgins, and Howell (1991) adapted
and refined a model for intermediate system contexts and
used the model to predict personal computer utilization.
However, the nature of the model makes it particularly suit-
able for predicting individual acceptance and use of a range
of information technologies.
MM.A significant body of research in psychology has sus-
tained general motivation theory as an explanation for behav-
ior. Several studies have examined motivational theory and
adapted it to specific contexts (Table 11).
UTAUT
UTAUT is a model of individual acceptance that is compiled
from eight models and theories (TRA, TAM, MM, TPB,
C-TAM-TPB, MPCU, IDT, and SCT; Venkatesh, Morris,
Davis, & Davis, 2003; Figure 8).
Each of the constructs mentioned in IDT, TRA, TAM,
TPB, C-TAM-TPB, MPCU, MM, and SCT pertained to
one of UTAUT's main constructs and measurement items
(Table 12).
The purpose of formulating UTAUT was to integrate the
fragmented theory and research on individual acceptance of
information technology into a unified theoretical model
(Venkatesh et al., 2003). To do so, the eight specific models
of the determinants of intention and usage of information
technology were compared and conceptual and empirical
similarities across these models were used to formulate
UTAUT (Venkatesh et al., 2003; Table 13).
To conclude, UTAUT advanced individual acceptance
research by unifying the theoretical perspectives common in
the literature and incorporating four moderators to account
for dynamic influences, including gender, age, voluntariness,
and experience (Venkatesh et al., 2003). It seems reasonable
to assume that UTAUT could be used to study the acceptance
and use of English learning websites. We therefore intro-
duced subjective task value to UTAUT in addressing our
research question.
Method
Research Model
In this study, we use UTAUT to study acceptance and use of
English E-learning websites by Taiwanese college students.
According to UTAUT, four factors influence use of English
E-learning websites: performance expectancy, effort expec-
tancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions.
We did not consider the moderating effect of gender, age,
experience, and voluntariness in this study. Because our par-
ticipants are all college students, the gender, age, experience,

and voluntariness are similar. Therefore, we have made some
alterations to our research model (Figure 9).
Hypotheses
The UTAUT model integrates the eight theoretical models
noted above and is composed of the core determinants of
usage intention (Venkatesh et al., 2003). Of the four core
determinants, performance expectancy, effort expectancy,
and social influence significantly predict intention. The
UTAUT model is well suited to the context of this study.
Based to these observations, we developed the hypotheses of
this study.
·
· Hypothesis 1: Performance expectancy positively
affects users' intentions to use English E-learning
websites.
·
· Hypothesis 2: Effect expectancy positively affects
users' intentions to use English E-learning websites.
·
· Hypothesis 3: Social influence positively affects
users' intentions to use English E-learning websites.
·
· Hypothesis 4: Facilitating conditions of English
E-learning websites positively affects users' use
behaviors of actually using English E-learning
websites.
·
· Hypothesis 5: Users' behavioral intentions to use
English E-learning websites positively affect the
users' use behavior of actually using English
E-learning websites.
Procedures
The data were gathered from college students in Taiwan. The
questionnaire of this study was modified from the question
items of Venkatesh et al. (2003). Because the questions from
the Chinese questionnaire were translated from English, the
questionnaire was first pretested on four Taiwanese college
students and was then slightly modified according to their
feedback before being scanned by two foreign language pro-
fessors. The initial tests demonstrated high reliability. The
questionnaire was placed on the MY3Q questionnaire web-
site (http://www.my3q.com) and sent to a random sample of
Taiwanese college students.
Participants
The participants of this study are college students in Taiwan.
We collected data from 176 respondents from more than 10
Taiwanese colleges. The main purpose was to collect data
regarding Taiwanese college students' English E-learning
websites use intentions.

Instrument
A survey questionnaire was used to collect data regarding
use of English E-learning websites among college students
in Taiwan. In addition to demographic information, this
paper-based questionnaire collected data from individual
users of English E-learning websites based on a number of
constructs in the research model. Earlier research by
Venkatesh et al. (2003) had validated measures for each of
the constructs; we decided to include those validated items in
our questionnaire. We used a Likert-type 5-point scale: 1 =
strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. A list of validated
items for each construct is provided in Table 14.
Analysis
We used the Statistics Package for Social Science (SPSS)
system to analyze the data using reliability analysis, correla-
tion analysis, and regression analysis.
Reliability analysis. Reliability analysis is a measure to define
the degree to which measurements are free from error and
therefore yield consistent results.
Correlation analysis. Correlation analysis is a measure of the
degree to which a change in the independent variable will
result in a change in the dependent variable.
Regression analysis.Regression analysis includes any tech-
niques for modeling and analyzing several variables, with a
focus on the relationship between a dependent variable and
one or more independent variables.
Results
Analysis
Descriptive analysis. All the 176 respondents of the question-
naire were Taiwanese college students. Table 15 represents
the demographics of the respondents.
The results showed that more males than females partici-
pated in the study. According to these descriptive statistics,
most of the respondents were seniors. Sixty-seven percent
were not language majors (Figure 10).
Reliability analysis. The data indicate that the measures are
robust in terms of their internal consistency reliability as
indexed by composite reliability. The reliability of the col-
lected data in this study was assessed by the Statistical
Package for Social Science (SPSS). The composite reli-
abilities ranged from 0.76 to 0.95, which exceed the recom-
mended threshold value of 0.70. Reliability results are
given in Table 16.

Correlation analysis.Convergent validity and discriminant
validity are assessed by Pearson correlation analysis. Guide-
lines suggest that factor loadings be greater than 0.50 (Hair,
Anderson, Tatham, & Black, 1998) or, under a stricter crite-
rion, greater than 0.70 (Fornell, 1982). All of the factor
results of items in this research model are higher than 0.50;
most of them are above 0.70. Every item is loaded signifi-
cantly (p < .01 in all cases) on its constructs. Therefore, all
constructs in the model have adequate reliability and conver-
gent validity. Correlation results are shown in Table 17.
Regression analysis. We use regression analysis to investigate
the influence of performance expectancy, effort expectancy
and social influence on intention to use. The results show
that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social

presented in Table 18.
We again use regression analysis to study the influence of
intention to use on user behavior. The results show that
facilitating conditions and intention to use significantly
affect use behavior. The results are presented in Table 19.
Confirmation of Hypotheses
The influence of students' performance expectancy for using Eng-
lish E-learning websites on intention to use English E-learning
websites.The results showed that Performance Expectancy
positively affects users' intentions to use English E-learning
websites ( = .346, p < .001). Therefore, H1 is supported.
This means that when students expect an English E-learning
website to increase their performance, they increase their
intentions to use it.
The influence of students' Effect Expectancy for using English
E-learning websites on intention to use English E-learning web-
sites.The results showed that Effect Expectancy positively

Table 20. The Confirmation of Hypotheses.
Hypotheses Confirmed
H1: Performance expectancy positively affects users'
intentions to use English E-learning websites
Yes
H2: Effect expectancy positively affects users'
intentions to use English E-learning websites
Yes
H3: Social influence positively affects users' intentions
to use English E-learning websites
Yes
H4: Facilitating conditions of English E-learning
websites positively affects users' use behavior of
actually using English E-learning websites
Yes
H5: Users' behavioral intentions to use English
E-learning websites positively affect the users'
use behavior of actually using English E-learning
websites
Yes
that when students expect an English E-learning website to
be easy to use, they increase their intentions to use it.
The influence of students' Social Influence to use English
E-learning websites on intention to use English E-learning
websites.The results showed that Performance Expec-
tancy positively affects users' intentions to use English
E-learning websites ( = .282, p < .001). Therefore, H3 is
supported. This means that when students' teachers, peers
or someone important to them suggests that they use Eng-
lish E-learning websites, they increase their intentions to
use them.
The influence of students' Facilitating Conditions for using Eng-
lish E-learning websites on use behavior. The results showed
that Facilitating Conditions positively affect users' use
behavior of actually using English E-learning websites ( =
.066, p < .05). Therefore, H4 is supported. This means that
when students receive more facilitating conditions to use
English E-learning website, they use the websites more
frequently.
The influence of students' Intention to Use English E-learning
websites on use behavior. The results showed that Intention to
Use positively affects users' use behavior of actually using
English E-learning websites ( = .098, p < .01). Therefore,
H5 is supported. This means that when students have more
intent to use an English E-learning website, they use the
website more frequently (Table 20).
Discussion
Conclusion
The results support the UTAUT model's use to study the accep-
tance of English E-learning websites.The UTAUTmodel shows
that students' use behavior of English E-learning websites
depends on performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and
social influence. Therefore, we suggest that web designers
improve knowledge management functions and make user inter-
faces easier to operate. Furthermore, students should be notified
that the websites can be supported by facilitating conditions.
Limitations and suggestions
Because this study only examines the acceptance of English
E-learning websites among Taiwanese college students, the
results may not be generalized to other E-learning systems
and countries. Therefore, we suggest that a future researcher
validate the model and findings in other E-learning systems
or other countries.
