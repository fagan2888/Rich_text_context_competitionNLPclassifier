BRIEF REPORT
A Comparison of Underlying Cause and
Multiple Causes of Death
US Vital Statistics, 2000­2001
Matthew D. Redelings,* Frank Sorvillo,* and Paul Simon*
Background: Mortality statistics can be compiled using underlying
cause-of-death data or multiple cause-of-death data, which include
other contributing causes of death.
Methods: For the leading causes of death in the United States
during 2000­2001, we compared underlying and multiple cause-of-
death statistics.
Results: For some conditions, little difference was observed be-
tween the 2 estimates. For other conditions, up to 10 times more
deaths were identified from multiple-cause data than from underly-
ing-cause data. The 10 leading causes of death differed when using
the 2 types of data.
Conclusions: Whenever possible, underlying and multiple cause-of-
death statistics should both be presented. Analyses that use only the
underlying cause of death ignore additional information that is readily
available from multiple-cause data, and the more limited data may
underestimate the importance of several leading causes of death.
Analysis of mortality data is critical in efforts to assess the
burden of disease, to develop policy initiatives, and to
design effective public health interventions. Generally, cause-
of-death statistics are compiled by examining the underlying
cause of death as specified on death certificates by the
examiner.1 The underlying cause of death is defined as "the
disease or injury that initiated the train of events leading
directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or
violence, which produced the fatal injury."2
However, deaths rarely have only 1 cause, and relying
on underlying cause-of-death data does not allow researchers
to assess the role of other conditions that contributed to death.
In many cases, these additional conditions may have been
necessary factors in the chain of events leading to death, such
that death would not have occurred in their absence. Yet
because they did not initiate the chain of events resulting in
death, they are overlooked in underlying cause-of-death anal-
yses. Underlying-cause data are also limited in that different
examiners often disagree as to which of the many factors
contributing to death was the underlying cause.3 Multiple
cause-of-death data, which specify both the underlying cause
of death and as many as 20 contributing causes of death, offer
an alternative.4
Mortality analyses that inform policy and funding ini-
tiatives at state and national levels still rely almost exclu-
sively on underlying-cause statistics.5­11 Thus, policy deci-
sions may be taken based on information that seriously
underestimates the importance of some causes of death.
However, the extent to which analyses of underlying causes
of death and analyses of multiple causes of death differ for
the leading causes of death has not been fully addressed.
We compared death statistics compiled using multiple-
cause data with statistics compiled from underlying-cause data
in the United States during 2000­2001 for the 50 rankable
leading causes of death as defined by the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS).12 We evaluated the degree of differ-
ence between underlying- and multiple-cause statistics.
METHODS
Data were examined for all reported deaths occurring in
the United States during the years 2000 and 2001. We used
national multiple-cause-of-death data to identify both under-
lying and contributing causes of death.13 Mortality frequen-
cies were tabulated for each condition comparing any men-
tion of the condition with a listing of the condition as the
underlying cause only.
A list of 50 rankable leading causes of death and
cause-specific International Classification of Diseases, 10th
Revision codes was obtained from NCHS.12,14,15 Rankable
leading causes were formulated by sorting several common
causes of death into 50 mutually exclusive categories that
were thought to be useful from a public health perspective.6
We identified special conditions of interest not among the
rankable leading causes of death from an NCHS-compiled list
of 113 causes of death.12
RESULTS
A total of 4,827,153 deaths were reported in the United
States in 2000­2001. An average of 2.70 causes of death
per decedent were listed in multiple cause-of-death data
(median  2.00, lower quartile  2.00, upper quartile 
4.00). Only 5% of decedents had more than 5 causes of death

listed on the death certificate, and 25% had only 1 cause of
death listed.
The degree of agreement between underlying and mul-
tiple cause-of-death statistics varied by condition. For inten-
tional injuries (homicide, suicide), the underlying cause of
death captured 99% of deaths identified in multiple-cause
data (Table 1; supplementary table available with the online
version of this article). Underlying-cause data also captured
more than 90% of deaths reported in multiple-cause data for
malignant neoplasms and HIV.
However, underlying-cause data captured only a frac-
tion of deaths identified by multiple-cause data for some
leading causes of death: diabetes mellitus (33%); influenza
and pneumonia (29%); nephritis, nephrosis, and nephrotic
syndrome (19%); and essential hypertension and hyperten-
sive renal disease (8%).
For other leading causes of death, the degree of agree-
ment between underlying-cause and multiple-cause statistics
was moderate. Underlying-cause data captured 73% of deaths
recorded by multiple-cause data from accidents or uninten-
tional injuries, 61% percent of deaths from heart disease, 60%
of deaths from Alzheimer disease, 59% percent of deaths
from cerebrovascular disease, and 49% of deaths from
chronic lower respiratory disease.
The 10 leading causes of death differed when we exam-
ined the 2 types of statistics (Table 2). Although the ranking
of the first 4 leading causes of death is the same for
both sources, the fifth leading cause according to underlying
cause reports (accidents) is ranked tenth according to multi-
ple-cause data. Conversely, the fifth most common cause
according to multiple-cause data (essential hypertension and
hypertensive renal disease) does not appear on the underly-
ing-cause list. Alzheimer disease is the eighth most common
underlying cause, but it is not among the 10 most common
multiple causes. The rankings are similar on the 2 lists for the
following: diabetes mellitus; influenza and pneumonia; ne-
phritis, nephrosis, and nephrotic syndrome; and septicemia.
DISCUSSION
Our analyses indicate that the use of underlying cause-
of-death data alone substantially underrepresents the mortal-
ity burden for several important causes of death. The increase
in deaths observed when using multiple-cause data rather
than underlying-cause data differed widely by condition. For
some conditions, there was little difference between the 2
estimates. For other conditions, however, as many as 10 times
more deaths were found from multiple-cause data than from
underlying-cause data. The difference between the 2 sets of
statistics was extreme enough to affect the ranking of the 10
leading causes of death in the United States.
Mortality analyses that drive policy and funding
initiatives at state and national levels still rely almost

exclusively on underlying cause-of-death statistics.5­11
Underlying-cause estimates of the mortality burden are
only slightly lower than multiple-cause estimates for can-
cers, intentional injuries, and HIV. However, mortality
from diabetes mellitus, influenza and pneumonia, nephri-
tis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis, and essential hy-
pertension and hypertensive renal disease may be severely
underrecognized in underlying-cause data. To a lesser
degree, mortality from other leading causes of death (in-
cluding unintentional injuries, heart disease, cerebrovas-
cular disease, and Alzheimer disease) may also be under-
recognized in underlying-cause data.
Analyses based on underlying-cause data alone may
fail to recognize the full importance of these conditions,
resulting in policy choices that may not be the most effective.
Diabetes prevention, for example, may not be given the
funding that it deserves if policymakers estimate mortality
based solely on underlying-cause statistics, which capture
approximately one third of diabetes deaths identified from
multiple-cause statistics. Similarly, the impact of influenza
and pneumonia may be substantially underestimated if re-
searchers tabulate mortality based solely on underlying-cause
statistics, which fail to capture approximately 70% of influ-
enza and pneumonia deaths, as tabulated in multiple cause-
of-death reports. Even for conditions such as lung cancer, in
which underlying-cause statistics capture 94% of multiple-
cause-identified deaths, the additional 6% of deaths not rec-
ognized by underlying-cause statistics represent more than
10,000 individuals per year.
Although underlying-cause statistics by themselves can
fail to describe the full importance of a disease or condition
as a cause of death, multiple-cause statistics by themselves
can fail to convey the sometimes marginal importance of the
condition in generating the deaths it is reported to have
caused. Conditions with extremely low case fatality such as
anemia may be reported as contributing causes of death in
multiple-cause data even if they have played only a negligible
role. They may even be reported simply to reflect their
prevalence at the time of death. In this analysis, for example,
multiple-cause data showed both anemia and prostate cancer
as having caused approximately 90,000 deaths from 2000
to 2001. However, prostate cancer was reported as the
underlying cause of death in approximately 70% of cases,
whereas anemia was only reported as the underlying cause
in 10% of cases. Although multiple-cause data reports
almost the same number of deaths from prostate cancer as
from anemia, additional information from underlying-
cause data indicates that prostate cancer is more important
as a cause of death.
This report has important limitations. No gold standard
exists for cause-of-death statistics. Causes of death may be
incorrectly reported on death certificates. It is not possible to
discern based on the coding how important a role the condi-
tion played in causing death or whether death could have
been postponed if the condition had been prevented. Death
certificates may not contain information on conditions such as
depression that cause substantial morbidity but contribute to
death only indirectly. Although there are inherent differences
between the 2 types of cause-of-death data, some discrepancy
may also be due to the accuracy of reporting, and these
effects are very difficult to assess.
We suggest that both multiple and underlying cause-
of-death statistics should be presented to provide readers with
a more complete picture of the mortality burden from differ-
ent conditions. Exclusive use of either type of cause-of-death
statistic ignores important information that is readily avail-
able and is helpful in characterizing cause-specific mortality.
However, for conditions such as anemia in which case fatality
is low, caution should be exercised in interpreting additional
cases found in multiple-cause data.
