ABSTRACT
The objective was to assess whether rates of preventive
counseling delivered at well child visits (WCVs) differ for
practices with basic, fully functional, or no electronic
health record (EHR). Cross-sectional analyses of WCVs
included in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
Electronic Medical Records Supplement, 2007­2010
were performed. Practices with fully functional EHRs
documented delivery of 34% more counseling topics
than those without an EHR. WCVs with a fully functional
EHR lasted 3.5 more minutes than those with a basic
EHR. Overall, for each additional 10 min, 12% more
topics were covered, regardless of EHR functionality.
Further studies should assess the impact of such systems
on the quality of patient care during preventive care
visits and on health outcomes.
INTRODUCTION
Provision of anticipatory guidance to assist patients
and their families in preventing multiple morbid-
ities is a critical component of pediatric well-child
visits (WCVs).1 Many professional organizations,
including the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP)2 and American Academy of Family
Physicians (AAFP),3­5 recommend counseling all
pediatric patients about diet and nutrition, exercise,
injury prevention, and tobacco exposure, among
other topics, at every WCV
. Electronic health
records (EHRs) can provide clinical decision
support (CDS) to guide providers in discussing pre-
ventive topics. Use of CDS has been shown to
improve the care of children with asthma6 and
ADHD.7 While the use of EHRs in the USA is
expanding with an influx of governmental
support,8 most are initially designed with adult
patients in mind, and the impact of EHRs on pedi-
atric WCVs is unknown. Prior studies have assessed
anticipatory guidance delivered at visits with paper
compared to computerized data entry,9 but none
have yet examined preventive services based on the
functionality of an EHR. We analyzed a nationally
representative sample to assess whether functional-
ity of EHRs is associated with the length of WCVs
and with reported rates of preventive counseling.
METHODS
Data source
We performed cross-sectional analyses, combining
data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS)
Electronic Medical Records Supplement from
2007­2010. Both surveys are collected annually by
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
and are publically available. NAMCS provides
information about the use of ambulatory medical
care services; NHAMCS provides details about
hospital-based outpatient and emergency depart-
ments in the USA. Both use a multistage probability
sampling design for physician practices and patient
visits within practices, which, when weighted, pro-
vides nationally representative estimates of ambula-
tory visits in the USA. For each visit, the physician
or a staff member completes a survey form that
identifies patient demographics, counseling topics
discussed, International Classification of Diseases,
9th edition (ICD-9) codes, and the visit duration.
Measures
We included WCVs (defined by ICD-9 codes
V20.2, V70.0, V70.3, V70.5, V70.6, V70.8,
V70.9) made to pediatric, family medicine, or gen-
eralist offices by children and adolescents aged
0­18 years.10 As defined by researchers at the
NCHS,11 we categorized EHR use as none, basic,
or fully functional, with the following criteria:
basic systems have the ability to record patient
history and demographics, problem lists, physician
clinical notes, and medication lists, perform com-
puterized prescription ordering, and allow lab and
imaging result viewing; fully functional systems do
all of these functions, and also include drug inter-
action warnings, ability to send prescriptions dir-
ectly to pharmacies, computerized orders for lab
tests, highlighted out-of-range lab values, medical
history and follow-up notes, and reminders for
guideline based interventions or screening tests.
Providers were able to answer `yes', `yes, but
turned off or not used', `no', or `unknown' to each
function. Providers answering `yes' to each item
noted above were labeled as basic or fully func-
tional users of the EHR. These items are included
in the meaningful use `Core Set' objectives. No
EHR use was defined by participants who answered
`no' to the question `Does your OPD [outpatient
department] use electronic medical records (not
including billing records)?'
We delineated child age (infant, <2; child, 2 to
<11; adolescent, 11­18); race/ethnicity (White,
Black, Hispanic, or other); insurance (private,
public, other); and percentage of poverty in the
patient's zip code (<5%, 5 to <10%, 10 to <20%,
and 20%). We identified the practice owner
(physician, other hospital, or other); specialty
(pediatric or general medicine); and provider type
seen at the visit (Doctor of Medicine or
Osteopathic Medicine (MD/DO), or physician
assistant/nurse practitioner (PA/NP)).
We examined rates of counseling for the follow-
ing topics (as defined by survey questions): diet/

nutrition, exercise, growth/development, injury prevention,
tobacco use/exposure, any health education (any of these listed
topics), and other health education (any topic other than those
specifically listed). We also assessed the total number of topics
discussed, and the time spent at the visit (NAMCS only, not
included in NHAMCS).
Analyses
We used 2 tests to compare the differences for categorical
demographic variables and topics being discussed between the
three different EHR categories. We used negative binomial
regression to test for differences between the EHR categories
for the total number of topics being discussed, for both bivariate
and multiple regression, since this was an over-dispersed discrete
variable. All analyses were done using Stata V
.12.1, and were
weighted to be nationally representative, adjusted for the
complex sampling design.
RESULTS
A total of 8650 visits were included in the dataset, representing
an annual average of 47 million visits nationally. Given the
higher rate of recommended visits in the first year of life, almost
half (45%) of visits were for children <2 years of age (table 1).
There were no significant differences in EHR use based on
patient or practice demographic characteristics. Overall, 77% of
preventive visits were performed with no EHR, 14% with a
basic EHR, and 9% with a fully functional EHR. Finally, 89%
of WCVs had no EHR in 2007, compared to 65% in 2010; 3%
were fully functional in 2007 compared to 17% in 2010.
The highest rates of counseling were for diet/nutrition (47%,
45%, and 57%; p=0.33), growth (46%, 45%, and 57%;

p=0.37), and any health education (68%, 72%, and 75%;
p=0.54) for none, basic, and fully functional EHRs, respectively
(figure 1). While diet/nutrition, exercise, growth and injury
counseling trended toward being higher at visits with a fully
functional EHR, these differences were not significant.
Time (in minutes) spent at the preventive visit (19.8 vs 18.6
vs 22.1 min; p=0.12) for none, basic, and fully-functional EHR
practices, respectively, were similar when examined overall. If
we strictly compare basic to fully functional EHRs, the differ-
ences in time spent are significant, with fully functional EHR
visits taking 3.5 min more (18% longer) than those with basic
EHRs (p=0.05).
Table 2 shows the total number of topics discussed at the pre-
ventive visit. Controlling for patient age, insurance, level of
poverty, and provider specialty, practices with a fully functional
EHR documented delivery of 34% more counseling topics than
those without an EHR (p=0.01). In addition, patients aged 2 to
<11 years (p = 0.002) and 11 to 19 years (p=0.02) received
11% and 12% more counseling topics, respectively, than
infants. Individuals living in areas with 20% poverty received
20% less counseling compared to those in areas with <5%
poverty (p=0.04). General practitioners provided 43% fewer
counseling topics compared to pediatricians (<0.001).
When time spent at the visit is included in the model, visits
with fully functional EHRs provided 36% more counseling than
those without an EHR (p=0.009). For each 10-min increase in
the time spent, the average number of topics discussed increased
by 12% (p=0.01), irrespective of EHR functionality.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to examine the quality of care delivered at
pediatric preventive visits based on the functionality of a prac-
tice's EHR system. Based on a nationally representative survey,
we found that visits performed at practices with fully functional
EHRs documented delivery of 34% more counseling topics than
those without an EHR. Notably, 18% more time was spent at
WCVs with fully-functional compared to basic EHRs, and for
each 10-min increase in time spent at the visit, 12% more topics
were documented as being discussed.
Rates of EHR use in our study were similar to a 2008
national study of adult and pediatric ambulatory practices (13%
basic, 4% fully functional),12 but lower than the rate of 32% in
2009 of `advanced stage' EHRs reported for inpatient stays for
children in 2009.13 With government stimulus money to
support regional extension centers and bonuses to providers for
using EHRs in a meaningful way built into the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the number of prac-
tices using `fully-functional' EHRs will increase rapidly, as
occurred between 2009­2010 during which fully-functional
practices increased from 8­17%, and others have noted.14
The number of counseling topics reported as discussed was
highest at visits with fully-functional EHRs. We must caution
that (a) the database includes topics reported to be discussed,
and (b) we cannot necessarily assume causation in this cross-
sectional study. However, we speculate that this association with
functionality of EHRs could be related to age-specific templates

or cues incorporated into EHR templates; such structured WCV
templates have been shown to improve provision of anticipatory
guidance.15 16 This is promising as more practices move to
using such systems. It is unclear what EHR component might
have increased the counseling provided, since specific compo-
nents of CDS were not measured in NAMCS/NHAMCS. In
addition, the number of topics discussed do not equate to the
quality of discussion or to patient behavior change. Future
studies are needed to assess these issues.
Rates of counseling were not significantly higher for any spe-
cific topic, although there appears to be a trend toward greater
discussion of each topic when a fully-functional EHR is used.
Only diet and growth were discussed at half of visits; all other
topics were discussed less frequently, with tobacco counseling
noted at only 11% of visits overall. Of note, documenting
tobacco usage and providing tobacco cessation counseling for
patients over age 13 is a meaningful use criterion to receive
reimbursement from the Center for Medicaid Services.17
Therefore it is likely that this measure will improve dramatically
for practices using EHRs. In a 2011 Cochrane review,18 docu-
mentation of tobacco status did increase, as did referral to
tobacco cessation counseling, when an EHR was in place.
Documentation was moderate for diet counseling, but quite
poor for exercise counseling. These topics are categorized as
alternative quality measures for meaningful use, so it is critical
for pediatric-oriented EHRs to integrate such documentation
into the workflow for providers to both provide and receive
credit for such counseling.
Studies vary on whether computerized systems add time to
visits, with one study noting an additional 5 min spent at pediat-
ric preventive visits,9 and others showing no change.19 20 We
found that visits with a fully functional EHR took 3.5 min
longer than those with a basic EHR, which could relate to the
additional counseling provided. However, we do not have data
about how long each practice has used its EHR, which may
affect visit length. While the definition of fully functional EHRs
did include provider prompts, we do not have details about the
type, placement, or use of prompts which must be easily visible,
timely, and integrated into the provider's workflow to be effect-
ive.21 22 Nevertheless, an increase of 18% in visit length for
WCVs, if confirmed, represents a substantial lengthening of
pediatric visits.
While the long-term goal of a fully-functional EHR is to
improve the quality of care delivered, simply having such a
system does not ensure improved quality.23 24 Studies have
shown that EHR systems are often not used to their full cap-
acity,25 but clinicians who have used structured documentation
and have relied on CDS provided better care for specific chronic
conditions,26 had improved screening,27 28 and delivered better
preventive care.29 Ideally, a pediatric-oriented EHR will be able
to link to immunization information systems, provide decision
support for immunizations, and dose medications by body
weight, among other functions.30 We are hopeful that the
finding of increased counseling provided with a more functional
EHR will carry over to other improved abilities to provide pedi-
atric preventive care.
Limitations
The counseling provided and time spent at the visit was docu-
mented by the provider, and could result in over- or under-
reporting.31 Of note, the WCV times in our study were similar
to the average time of 20.3 min for WCVs noted in a recent
study (observed and timed).32 One other study has shown that
providers over-report time spent on the NAMCS survey33;
however we would not expect under- or over-reporting to vary
based on EHR status. Also, we have no information about what
CDS was in place.
CONCLUSION
In this national study, we found that 34% more counseling
topics were documented at pediatric preventive care visits in
practices using a fully-functional EHR compared to those
without an EHR, but visits using fully-functional EHRs lasted
longer than WCVs using basic EHRs. Further studies should
assess the impact of EHRs on patient care quality and outcomes.
