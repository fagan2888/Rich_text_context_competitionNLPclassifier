Anachronistic Terminology Fails to
Define Diversity in Today's College
Student
There is an expansive literature identifying potential factors
that are argued to produce and sustain the academic achieve-
ment gap faced by minority groups in the United States.
Equally, there have been waves of educational policies and
reforms directed toward addressing and ameliorating such
factors. It is beyond the scope of this article to review and/or
summarize this history. While terms such as multicultural
education, culturally sensitive pedagogy, and diversity and
inclusivity are widely used throughout the abundant litera-
ture, research assessing the academic achievement gap, as
well as the intervention programs directed toward ameliorat-
ing its known contributing factors, continues to use outdated
population categories such as "Latino," "Hispanic," and
"Black" as racial/ethnic and cultural descriptors that fail to
reflect the compositions of ethnically diverse populations as
they occur today. How do we then explain or justify the use
of these restrictive terms to describe highly complex multi-
cultural/multiethnic diverse populations and their subethnic
groups? Such questions have recently become the focus of
attention as these restrictive terms inaccurately define the
ethnic composition of today's increasingly diverse U.S.
undergraduate college student populations. The use of such
restrictive and unmatched terms obscures what these confin-
ing categories attempt to describe, and subsequently creates
more ambiguity as to what "diversity" actually represents in
both smaller simplex and larger complex categories of multi-
ethnic populations. It is our opinion that these monolithic
descriptors of the college undergraduate minority student
populations, in fact, constrain the definition of diversity and
limit any valid extrapolations on data targeted to design
interventions for educational reform. Thus, the term diversity
as it is used today to label these very diverse multiethnic and
subethnic groups inadequately represents all ethnicities in

Making the Case for Real Diversity:
Redefining Underrepresented Minority
Students in Public Universities
B. Runi Mukherji1,2, Lorenz S. Neuwirth1,2, and Laura Limonic3
Abstract
Immigration to the United States has been a major catalyst for population growth and is the significant factor in the changing
racial/ethnic composition of our population. The specific changes in the racial/ethnic mix in United States in recent times
are due in large part to a surge in immigration from diverse sending countries. However, much of the terminology that
continues to be used in the context of higher education to describe diversity in the student populations are anachronistic
and serves actually to occlude true diversity. We argue that variables such as country of birth of the student, the country of
origin of the parent, and parental educational achievement, all have significant impact on the academic progress and success
of undergraduate underrepresented minority students. These are variables that should be used to disaggregate the traditional
racial and ethnic categories, to really serve the needs of the increasingly diverse student body. These are not data typically
collected by institutions of higher education, but without which appropriate needs assessments and targeted interventions
cannot occur.

which educational interventions for diverse populations
should be designed (i.e., a nonmatch to sample educational
prescription). Treating the increasingly diverse college
undergraduate student population with a "one prescription
for education fits all approach" may serve only to maintain,
or perhaps even widen, the current academic achievement
gap.
In the current context of intense scrutiny regarding educa-
tional outcomes and assessment in the U.S. public under-
graduate 2- and 4-year colleges, the use of descriptors (e.g.,
Latino, Hispanic, or Black) lacks sensitivity to the true
changes in today's diverse college student populations. In
addition, these descriptors are ineffective in guiding educa-
tional assessment and further reform processes geared toward
understanding and ameliorating the disparities that continue
to exist in public colleges and universities. The call for the
disaggregation of data is not new. Traditionally, Asian stu-
dents are not perceived as an "undeserved minority"; in fact,
they are often seen as "the model minority," suggesting that
they are more academically successful and do not face the
academic challenges experienced by other racial/ethnic
minority groups. However, an accruing body of research
indicates that the "Asian" category is not a monolithic group.
The academic success of some subethnic groups such as
Chinese, Korean, and Japanese are very different from other
subethnic groups such as Cambodian and Laotian, where
academic performance is actually lower, drop-out rates are
higher, and college completion rates are reduced. The aggre-
gation within the "Asian and Pacific Islander" category ren-
ders these subethnic groups invisible (see Chang, Park, Lin,
Poon, & Nakanishi, 2007; Teranishi, 2010). One example of
increasing the sensitivity in assessing subethnic Asian popu-
lation needs occurred in 2007, where the University of
California moved to change its undergraduate application to
reflect the diversity of its student body by disaggregating the
"Asian American and Pacific Islander" category the follow-
ing year, expanding from its original eight to now 23 catego-
ries. Until all subethnic group data are disaggregated and
evaluated within the same context, the reporting of diversity
in the college education system will remain ambiguous.
The Definition of the Term "Diversity"
Within the Literature Remains
Obscure
The achievement gap among increasingly diverse student
populations and equity concerns are no less profound, nor
less pressing, for institutions of higher education across the
nation. However, research and writing in postsecondary edu-
cation seems not to recognize the need to "fine-tune" termi-
nology and to recharacterize the diverse student populations
to suitably parse out and further differentiate the "true diver-
sity" of the current and future multiethnic public undergradu-
ate student populations. This is particularly problematic in
the continued use of the term underrepresented minority
(URM), which often translates as the broad categories of
Black and Hispanic students when discussing issues of
recruitment, funding, and support of students in specific cur-
ricular areas such as the science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (STEM) fields in postsecondary
education.
A recent study on the efficacy of developmental pro-
grams' (i.e., services for the underprepared college students;
also known as remedial, foundational, guided, or transitional
programming) success as measured by student degree com-
pletion in community colleges, noted multiple academic
achievement gaps and recommended for more sensitive
assessment, placement, and reformations in pedagogy.
However, the report continued to use broad descriptive terms
such as "African-American," "Latino," and "White" to
describe URM student plurality (Center for Community
College Student Engagement [CCCSE], 2016). While the
report was scattered with multiple photographs representing
a widely diverse URM student population comprised of
varying racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds, none of the
suggested recommendations recognized, nor addressed with
a more refined analysis, the diversity represented in those
pictorial representations. Much of the literature on college
student educational outcomes continues to present data in
aggregation. A recent report from the Association of
American Colleges & Universities (AAC&U), tracking the
priorities and trends in higher education, shows that while
member institutions have adopted changes with priorities
directed toward successful advancement for all students, few
disaggregate data on student characteristics (e.g., race/eth-
nicity) to accurately track student achievement of adopted
institutional learning outcomes (Hart Report, 2015). This
report indicated that while a majority of institutions (70%)
tracked the achievement of learning outcomes, only 16% of
them disaggregate the data by variables such as race/ethnic-
ity, 9% by income levels, and even less by the undergraduate
student's parent's educational attainment (6%). This latter
variable is arguably an important predictor of the undergrad-
uate student's ability to complete their degree, which remains
often overlooked.
Many public educational institutions collect data only
with the five Office of Management and Budget (OMB) cat-
egories for their student populations. The OMB aggregates
diversity by using a minimum of five categories: White,
Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska
Native,Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.
Interestingly, when searching for reports and their readouts
within the literature, in many instances, the data are actually
further aggregated rather than disaggregated. The widely
used category of URM is a case in point, which aggregates
together Black and Hispanic categories making extrapola-
tions for each individual subethnic group undecipherable.
The response to a query about race or ethnicity is a mea-
sure of "identity" and "self-construction," both of which
Mukherji et al. 3
have important psychological consequences and further
affects the many aspects of an individual's cognitive func-
tioning. These issues are at the heart of ethnic and cross-
cultural psychology, both burgeoning fields well beyond the
scope of this article to delineate further. However, one true
challenge for current and ongoing research in these respec-
tive fields must address the issue of "disaggregation": break-
ing down large categories like Black, Hispanic, Asian, and so
on, even URM for that matter, into smaller more appropriate
subethnic categories such as Central American, South
American, South Asian, African, and so on. Moreover, if and
when appropriate, these data require further parsing by the
student's parental country of origin. Due to increased subeth-
nic group variability, the true "identity" of each of these sub-
ethnic groups are currently masked within the aggregated
data. As previously mentioned, it is impossible to have evi-
dence-based assessments and targeted interventions in
STEM or other fields of education, without access to disag-
gregated data. Perez and Hirschman (2009) traced changes in
the U.S. Census categories of race or ethnicity and the effects
of that type of data disaggregation on the concept of identity.
Their research suggested that the blurring of boundaries
between traditional racial/ethnic categories due to interracial
marriages (i.e., the "multiracial blending" of America) has
resulted in the dual effects of both reducing the salience of a
given race and/or ethnicity in American society and "racial-
izing" disadvantaged multiracial blends of subethnic groups.
Therefore, the educational institutions must be very consci-
entious, careful, and yet critical of determining the best and
most appropriate approaches for disaggregating data without
racializing these subethnic groups.
We argue that disaggregating data in the postsecondary
context, particularly at 2- and 4-year public institutions, would
reveal important factors contributing to the academic achieve-
ment gap such as parental educational background, and parent
and student nativity. This information would be of particular
importance when discussing potential future predictive ana-
lytic-based educational interventions addressing the academic
achievement gap for specific "minority" populations. These
types of ethnic background variables appear to have signifi-
cant effects on retention, academic persistence, and achieve-
ment. Thus, disaggregating diversity data regarding the
variables affecting academic performance is paramount for
assessing the precise needs of specific subethnic populations
within the larger racial/ethnic categories to design effective
evidence-based programs, which target the exact needs of
these distinct populations. To illustrate this timely issue, we
will discuss the State University of New York (SUNY), argu-
ably the largest and most diverse public university system in
the United States, and SUNY Old Westbury (SUNY-OW), its
most diverse campus. The types of disaggregated data argued
for in this article are currently not being collected by SUNY,
nor to our knowledge, at most other postsecondary public col-
lege institutions nationally. In the absence of this disaggre-
gated data, given the rapidly increasing diversity within the
student body, we argue that meaningful, evidence-based, and
targeted interventions cannot occur. Moreover, given our
nation's immigrant history, knowing more about student
parental nativity and country of origin may better inform us
about our undergraduate student population than previously
considered, as will be argued below.
Parental Nativity and Country of
Origin: A More Sensitive Form of
Diversity
Immigration to the United States has been a major catalyst
for population growth, as well as its by-product, of increas-
ing the various and diverse changes comprising the racial/
ethnic composition of the U.S. population. During the past
50 years, immigration accounted for over half of the total
U.S. population growth, and is projected to account for 88%
of the population growth from 2015-2065, if current trends
remain. Since 1965, the racial and ethnic composition of the
country has changed dramatically: The Hispanic U.S. popu-
lation rose from 4% in 1965 to 18% in 2015; the Asian popu-
lation increased from less than 1% to 6%; the non-Hispanic
White population decreased from 85% to 62%, and the Black
population remained relatively the same from 11% to 12%,
during the same time period. By 2060, the United States will
see an even greater change in the population; Hispanic or
Latinos are expected to climb to 29% of the U.S. population,
and Asians to 9.4%. The change is attributable not only to the
post-1965 surge in immigration but also the aging of the
White native population in the United States (U.S. Census
Bureau, 2012). It is projected that immigration patterns will
continue to change the racial/ethnic group composition of
the country in the future (Pew Research Center, 2015) and as
such require the field to move in the direction of data
disaggregation.
The specific changes in the larger racial/ethnic groups are
due, in large part to a surge in diversity of sending countries.
In 2015, 13.5% of the U.S. population was foreign-born and
by 2020, this number is expected to rise to 14.3%. By 2030,
almost 16% of the U.S. population will have been born out-
side the United States, according to projections made by the
U.S. Census Bureau (2014). The upswing in immigration is
largely a direct result of the Hart Celler Act passed in 1965,
which dramatically changed the number and composition of
immigrants entering the United States. In 1960, prior to the
Hart Celler Act, 84% of immigrants were of European ori-
gin; by 2013, this number dropped to 14.2%. By 2013,
Mexicans (28%) accounted for the largest share of immi-
grant groups in the United States, followed by Asians
(25.8%); 24% of immigrants in 2013 cited other Latin
American countries as their country of origin (Pew Research
Center, 2013).
While these numbers are dramatic and shifting, they
obfuscate an important point, which is the diversity within
4 SAGE Open
larger multiethnic and racial groups. In 1980, the push for
official Census (OMB) panethnic group classifications came
in large part from Latino groups calling for remediation of
undercounting (i.e., the effect of which is to lower federal aid
dependent on population size; Anderson, 2015b). Today,
however, the placement of new immigrant's groups into
large panethnic or racial categories masks and further dilutes
the diversity within multiethnic groups (Itzigsohn, 2004;
Okamoto, 2003). For example, while Mexicans (and their
children) make up the majority of Latinos in the United
States today, Mexican immigrants are relative newcomers to
New York and joined existing Latino groups such as
Dominicans and Puerto Ricans (Foner, 2013; Smith, 2005).
Asians are an even more multiethnic group, spanning diverse
religions, languages, cultures, and vast geographic regions
(Okamoto & Mora, 2014). Black immigrants are often
grouped with African Americans, but their immigration his-
tory and their cultural backgrounds vary significantly from
that of African Americans, as do their experiences with sys-
temic racism (Kasinitz, Mollenkopf, & Waters, 2002;
Kasinitz, Mollenkopf, Waters, & Holdaway, 2008; Lieberson
& Waters, 1988). As a result of this classification scheme,
which was introduced by the U.S. Census and adopted by the
majority of governmental and nongovernmental institutions,
we lose the ability to understand important markers of dis-
tinction that are specific to country of origin, including, but
not limited to, gender roles, educational values, religious
affiliation, family and marriage arrangements, as well as
varying levels of social, cultural, and human capital that
diverge across regions.
In New York State, for example, unlike the majority of the
United States, Puerto Ricans are the largest Latino subethnic
group, followed by Dominicans and Mexicans (Krogstad &
Lopez, 2014). Due to the unique ties that Puerto Rico has
with the mainland United States, the lived Latino experience
of Puerto Ricans varies greatly from that of Mexicans. Puerto
Ricans have legal status, are more likely to speak English,
and have access to social services and embedded networks.
Mexicans, who recently arrived to New York, are less likely
to speak English, have fewer financial assets and less access
to government resources (Bergad & Klein, 2010). Mexicans,
while fewer in number than Puerto Ricans, are the fastest
growing Latino immigrant group in the New York area. As a
whole, foreign-born Mexicans have some of the lowest edu-
cational attainment rates among Latinos in the New York
area (Bergad, 2013). This suggests a likely correlation
between low educational attainment rates of young Mexican
immigrants and a combination of factors specific to mem-
bers of this group's national origin such as the lack of paren-
tal and peer support and low human capital levels. The rise in
Mexican migration to the New York area and the particular
challenges members of this subethnic group face further
underscore the need for data disaggregation among public
colleges and universities that will likely see an increase of
members from this subethnic group in the coming years.
A number of factors negatively affect educational attain-
ment in subethnic student populations such as college readi-
ness and retention among immigrant students, many of which
are country of origin specific. Larger racial and ethnic cate-
gories such as Latino or Asian obscure premigration struc-
tural barriers to education such as country of origin political
instability or economic development. Overall, immigrants
from more politically stable countries outperform their
immigrant peers who hail from destinations with a history of
political upheaval (Dronkers & de Heus, 2012). Similarly,
gross domestic product (GDP) levels have been positively
correlated with academic success among immigrants (Levels,
Dronkers, & Kraaykamp, 2008). The term Latino encom-
passes not only U.S.-born students of Latino heritage but
also immigrants from more than 33 countries. Yet within
Latin America, national economic development varies
widely from the Southern Cone to the Caribbean. Grouping
all immigrants from Latin America into one large panethnic
"Latino" category limits our understanding of premigration,
country-specific human capital. This results in a "one size
fits all" approach to pedagogical curriculum and programs,
where we argue a tailored approach is much more likely to
ensure success for a larger number of immigrant undergradu-
ate college students.
While social scientists have long pointed to cultural capi-
tal as a significant variable in educational attainment and
achievement (Bourdieu, 1987; Coleman, 1988), new research
indicates the importance of understanding how country-
specific cultural capital works as a meditating factor in
immigrant educational attainment. Prior research suggests
that cultural factors specific to styles of learning, as well as
familial and communal social pressure to excel, largely
account for the educational success of many Chinese and
Korean immigrants (Zhou & Kim, 2006). However, when all
Asian subethnic groups are lumped into one larger category,
the success of Chinese and Korean immigrants conceals the
experiences of other less-advantaged Asian subethnic groups
in the United States, such as immigrants from Cambodia,
Laos, or Vietnam. Members of these groups are more likely
to have arrived to the United States as refugees (or are chil-
dren of refugees) with fewer socioeconomic resources and
cultural capital which results in reduced ability to excel
within the U.S. educational system (Ngo & Lee, 2007).
Intersectionality is a term first introduced by Kimberlé
Crenshaw (1989, 1991), to refer to the ways in which iden-
tity should be understood multidimensionally (i.e., the over-
lap of institutionalized power structures in society operate to
create a "whole" which is larger than its constituent or com-
ponent parts). For example, one cannot fully understand the
experience of a Black woman without understanding that the
forces of discrimination, which operate at the level of race or
gender independently, intersect to create a systemic structure
of oppression or domination, which is greater than their sim-
ple additive components. The term intersectionality is used
in this article to emphasize that not including factors such as
Mukherji et al. 5
parental education, nativity, immigration status, and immi-
grant generation and using only the lens of the standard eth-
nic categories, fails to capture the true multidimensionality
of the undergraduate student population and does not veridi-
cally reflect students' experiences within the current educa-
tional system.
The intersectionality of premigration structural factors, as
well as, pre- and postmigration cultural and social capital
directly affect immigrants' educational achievement. A
nuanced and targeted approach to elucidate how different
subethnic groups are affected by the intersectionality of these
variables in today's diverse world is inevitable and abso-
lutely necessary to ensure the appropriate integration, college
readiness and retention, and educational success of U.S.
immigrant undergraduate students.
Parental Education and First-
Generation College (FGC) Students:
More Diverse Than Previously
Considered
FGC students are typically defined as students whose parents
never attended college. A National Center for Educational
Statistics (NCES; 2010) study found that even when control-
ling for variables such as prior high school academic prepa-
ration, demographic background, postsecondary credit
production or performance, FGC students were less likely to
earn a bachelor's degree as compared with students whose
parents had college education. They complete fewer under-
graduate college credits, earn lower grades, need more reme-
dial assistance, and are more likely to withdraw prior to
completing their degrees. As compared with students whose
parents obtained college degrees, FGC students were twice
as likely to leave college without earning a degree, 43% ver-
sus 20%, respectively. FGC students, even among those who
enter college expecting to earn a bachelor's degree attending
4-year institutions, are more likely to leave (29%) as com-
pared with those with college-educated parents (13%), and
they are less likely to earn a degree (47%) than those with
parents holding a college degree (78%). Only 26% of FGC
students who enroll in undergraduate colleges complete
degrees (i.e., after 8 years), as compared with those whose
parents went to college (Chen, 2005).
Students who are non-White and/or from low-income
families are disproportionately represented in the FGC
group. FGC students experience complex familial, cultural,
social, and economic pressures related to being the first in
their families to go to college, and these pressures have unde-
niable psychological consequences. Research indicates that
FGC students, as compared with their non­first-generation
counterparts, are both academically and psychologically
underprepared for college. They lack knowledge of the "ori-
enting" information pertaining to college: how to access
information about financial assistance and other forms of
support before they get into college, and then upon arrival,
they have additional difficulty acclimating themselves to the
routines and expectations of "college student life"; they tend
to delay entering postsecondary institutions, often for finan-
cial reasons, and many continue to work full-time, even after
enrollment, which further delays the time to degree comple-
tion (for more detailed analyses, see Tym, McMillion,
Barone, & Webster, 2004).
Other research indicates that FGC students are less likely to
receive support from their family (and community) to attend
2- and 4-year public colleges. Families of FGC students may
often discourage them from going to college, sometimes for
financial reasons, which leads to a sense of alienation from
their family support structures. In addition, this may raise FGC
student doubts about being "college material" and generalize
over to self-question whether or not they will succeed in col-
lege. This leads to a sense of disorientation, isolation, and an
unclear future (Engle, 2008; Gofen, 2009; Horn & Nuñez,
2000; Warburton, Bugarin, & Nuñez, 2001). FGC students are
less able to connect their current academic performance with
their expectations for the future, especially if they have no prior
family role model or reference model. For FGC students, there
is also a sense of cultural dislocation and/or disconnect with the
U.S. college experience (for a discussion of cultural capital
deficit,seeStephens,Fryberg,Markus,Johnson,&Covarrubias,
2012). Students whose parents have gone to college are typi-
cally brought up to see college as a "continuation" of their aca-
demic and social experience. For FGC students, going to
college may often be seen as a break from communal or social
roles, norms, and expectations from their cultural background
(Engle, Bermeo, & O'Brien, 2006). These FGC student
­specific needs provide ample evidence that early intervention,
as well as social and psychological support programs, are effec-
tive in promoting their readiness and retention in college
increasing their success toward degree completion.
There is one important caveat that needs to be made here:
the FGC versus non-FGC student may be an over-simplifica-
tion, and there is still considerable ambiguity in the defini-
tion of the term first generation. For example, is an FGC
student defined as having parents without a college degree?
Alternatively, is an FGC student defined as having at least
one parent with a college degree? What if one or both parents
attended college, but did not complete or graduate with a
degree? Thus, there is considerable variability (and ambigu-
ity) in the current literature as FGC is currently used. Thus,
the term FGC moving forward requires operational defini-
tion refinement and over generalization of its current inter-
pretation is cautionary.
Student Nativity: Generation as
Another Important Form of Diversity
However, while there is a positive association between
parental achievement and the academic success of the diverse
6 SAGE Open
college student, as pointed out above, there is an intersec-
tionality of the racial/ethnic category, academic achievement
of the parent, the immigrant generation of the person (i.e.,
whether they are the first generation of their family to be
born in the United States) and parental country of origin, that
needs to be examined as well. The flow of immigrants into
the country in recent decades has divided the group of "new
comers or nontraditional students" to the country into two
distinctively different groups, with strikingly dissimilar
characteristics. As the flows of immigrants from diverse
regions and countries of origin are so unique, the links
between immigrant status and postsecondary success are
very complex and highly dependent on the country of origin
of the parents. Moreover, this evidences that aggregating
data from such populations is inappropriate.
Baum and Flores (2011) discussed the children of more
recent immigrants in the context of postsecondary education.
Similar to the situation for native-born youth from low-
income backgrounds and whose parents do not have college
experience, children of immigrant backgrounds face many of
the same barriers to enrollment and success in college.
However, there is wide variation in the patterns of educa-
tional outcomes, which are related to the immigrant genera-
tion of the child (i.e., student) and the country of origin of
their immigrant parent. To summarize the detailed analysis
of Baum and Flores (2011), they point out that on "average,"
the children from immigrant families were just as likely as
native-born children to have a parent (i.e., father) with a col-
lege education. This "average" finding, however, obscures
the fact that foreign-born fathers from regions such as India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Africa, Iran, and Korea were nearly 8
times more likely to have a college degree as compared with
those fathers who were born in Laos, Cambodia, or the
Caribbean and Mexico. As discussed earlier, parental educa-
tion has an important academic influential effect on the suc-
cessful outcomes for the child and should be included in data
disaggregation.
Baum and Flores (2011) additionally summarized a body
of data and pointed out that first-generation immigrant (FGI)
status also has a significant effect on college enrollment and
attrition. FGI children are defined as foreign-born children of
immigrants and second-generation immigrants as U.S.-born
children of immigrants. Research indicates that FGI students
have higher likelihoods of enrolling in college than native-
born children. They also point to significant differences in
educational attainment differences between immigrants from
different regions of nativity. Black immigrants are less likely
than native-born Blacks, to possess some characteristics that
may impede their educational success: They are more likely
to be from two-parent families and/or attend better schools
(Baum & Flores, 2011). Other research indicates that immi-
grants are also more likely to come from racially and socio-
economically heterogeneous neighborhoods (Jargowski &
Komi, 2011). Baum and Flores (2011) discussed other issues
related to attitudes toward education, cultural identity, and
traditions regarding the primacy of education, all of which
increase the probability of success for their children, and
these vary markedly with the countries of origin of parents of
immigrant children.
In an analysis of immigrants and their children, Rumbaut
(2004) stated,
Differences in nativity (of self and parents) and in age and life
stage at arrival, which are criteria used to distinguish between
generational cohorts, are known to affect significantly the modes
of acculturation of adults and children in immigrant families,
especially with regard to language and accent, educational
attainment and patterns of social mobility, outlooks and frames
of reference, ethnic identity and even their propensity to sustain
transnational attachments over time. (p. 1164)
In summary, the body of research points to a wide variety
of factors influencing educational outcomes within the three
main broad categories of Black, Hispanic, and Asian. This
body of research supports the need to identify a more granu-
lar data set about students entering postsecondary educa-
tional institutions: parental academic achievement (i.e.,
whether the student is FGC), immigrant generation of the
student (i.e., whether they are native-born or foreign-born
[FGI]), and countries of origin of their parents.
Redefining College Student Diversity:
The SUNY
In September 2015, SUNY, which is arguably the largest and
most diverse public institution of higher education, released
a Diversity Brief (SUNY, 2015), stating,
Despite the evidenced-based definition and application of
diversity promulgated today, in practice, institutions across the
country, including those within SUNY, continue to struggle to
fully meet diversity goals and/or to take steps necessary to
prepare for projected demographic shifts . . . (p. 1)
The Diversity Brief (which defines URM with the tradi-
tional categories of Black and Hispanic) goes on to acknowl-
edge that while SUNY has made gains in the recruitment of
URMs in the total enrollment, from 14.7% to 23.3% in the
last decade, there remains a significant gap between the
retention and graduation rates of these URMs when com-
pared with their White and Asian counterparts. Pell grant
funding is a measure of student financial need, and 56% of
SUNY URM students are Pell grant recipients. Despite these
support systems, URM students and Pell grant recipients
have the lowest retention and graduation rates among SUNY
students. Low graduation and retention rates for URMs are
problematic not only for SUNY but is an issue of national
concern. While "access and success" rates in college enroll-
ment and completion have increased across the board, there
are some significant differences across racial and ethnic
groups. Nationally, for the years 2009-2011, the enrollment
Mukherji et al. 7
rates for Hispanics increased by 22%, and for Blacks by 8%.
However, the 6-year graduation rates in 2011 for the same
groups were 51% and 39.9%, respectively (Yeado, 2013).
To address the achievement gap within SUNY, its System
Administration has called for, among other initiatives, the
use of "predictive analytics" to "map-out" specific interven-
tion-based needs and the implementation of "high impact"
programs such as community engagement which have been
shown to positively affect URM retention and graduation
rates (SUNY, 2015, p. 33).
SUNY announced that it would now begin to provide its
students the opportunity to self-identify their sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity, which certainly is a creditable move
toward the recognition of student diversity. In addition,
SUNY is in the process of including a question about paren-
tal academic achievement in their new SUNY-wide Common
Application form. The SUNY application form does solicit
information about Hispanic/Latino identification, and in a
following question asks about "background" country (i.e.,
provides the following choices: Central America, Cuban,
Dominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South American, and
other Hispanic/Latino).
Given the aforementioned discussion about the sources of
the population growth with respect to specific countries of ori-
gin, this information can be used to provide targeted interven-
tions to subethnic groups comprising the nontraditional college
student population. However, in contrast to the SUNY catego-
ries for Hispanic/Latino identification, there is only one cate-
gorical response for Black or African American. We believe
that despite the intent of this data collection tool, some impor-
tant information is "lost in the data." A recent Pew report
(Anderson, 2015a) points to the fact that Black immigrant
populations have more than quadrupled since 1980. Jamaica
and Haiti are the two largest countries of origin from which
Black immigrant populations have come to the United States,
and account for 18% and 15% of the Black immigrant popula-
tion, respectively. Moreover, immigrants from Africa have
increased by 137% between the years 2000 and 2013, and they
constitute 36% of the foreign-born Black population.
This information about country of origin (i.e., nativity of
student or parent) is important to consider as the data indi-
cate that when compared with immigrants overall, foreign-
born Blacks speak English at a higher rate; immigrants from
Africa have higher levels of educational attainment (i.e., a
college degree) than Americans overall (30%). However,
Black immigrants from Central and South America, as well
as the Caribbean, have significantly lower rates of educa-
tional attainment, at 12%, 25% and 20%, respectively. The
Report goes on to point out that in the New York metropoli-
tan area, which is an important catchment area for SUNY,
foreign-born Blacks make up 28% of the Black population.
We are therefore arguing that the single response category
for Blacks, which conflates race with country of origin,
masks important information, which would be directly
related to students' academic performance and success.
In addition, a more recent report (Lopez & Gonzalez-
Barrera, 2016) points out, as we have earlier, that for U.S.
Hispanics, self-identity is a complex issue. Among Latinos
with Caribbean roots, according to the Pew Report, nearly a
quarter (24%) identify as Afro-Latino, Afro-Caribbean, or
Afro-(i.e., country of origin). There is no category, currently
in the SUNY application for these students to respond to that
matches their self-identification. This form of subethnic
group data disaggregation is critically important as the Pew
Report suggests that people identifying as Afro-Latino are
less likely to have a college education (24% as compared
with 37% of Latinos overall) and also have lower incomes
overall as compared with other Latinos.
We argue that adding response categories related to the
immigrant generation of the student, as well as parental and
student countries of nativity, with a more detailed desegrega-
tion of racial/ethnic identification would be very useful
information to parse the differences in the student popula-
tion. These parameters can and should be used in predictive
analytics in college education, which could then lead to sen-
sitive needs assessment, targeted interventions and
approaches to pedagogy in the classroom, and in other forms
of support structure. Early identification of these factors will
allow for development of fine-tuned interventions that can
be directed toward the appropriate student ethnic populations
for optimizing outcomes.
Student Diversity at SUNY-OW:
A Truly Representative Sample
Population
SUNY-OW is one of 14 comprehensive public liberal arts
undergraduate colleges in all of SUNY. It is the most student
diverse campus of the entire SUNY system, with 64% stu-
dent diversity (URM, Asian, and International student body)
as compared with the entire SUNY system-wide aggregate
student diversity of 34.2%. SUNY-OW has the highest per-
centage of URM student enrollment (53.3%), more than
double the SUNY-wide URM student enrollment of 23.2%
across the other 13 SUNY 4-year colleges (SUNY, 2015).
However, SUNY-OW currently does not institutionally col-
lect data that would disaggregate the subpopulations within
the categories of Black, Hispanic, or Asian, or information
about their immigrant generation of its students, or countries
of nativity of students or their parents. Anecdotally, we are
conscious of the wide subethnic group diversity that exists in
the backgrounds of our students. In an informal study con-
ducted by the authors during Fall 2015, a small sample of
students (n = 271) enrolled within psychology classes were
asked to indicate whether or not they were born in the United
States, and if not, where they were born. They were asked
about their parental nativity (i.e., where their parents had
been born) and if foreign-born, their country of origin and
the number of years each parent had been in the United
States. The results of this informal survey revealed that the
8 SAGE Open
majority of the sample (75%) had one or more parents born
in a country other than the United States. In addition, one in
four of the sample of students had been born in a country
other than the United States (see attached survey).
There is an important issue to raise in this context: while
self-identification by the dimensions of race/ethnicity or
nativity is done by most people fairly routinely, "FGI" or
"first generation to college" is not a label that students read-
ily apply to themselves. Anecdotally, the authors of this arti-
cle have found this to be true of our first-generation students
at SUNY-OW. To the extent that students may not consis-
tently self-identify as FGC/FGI, they do not perceive the dif-
ficulties they may experience in their adjustment to the
demands of an academic environment to their FGC/FGI sta-
tus. Furthermore, as they do not attribute their difficulties to
such causes, they do not seek out available services nor are
they able to reach out to other FGC/FGI students, who share
those same background factors as they, to lessen their sense
of isolation. Based on this insight, we at SUNY-OW have for
the past year been engaged in a series of efforts to raise
awareness of those factors shared by FGC/FGI students that
present barriers to success among our student body and the
wider college community. Last March, we held our inaugural
First Generation Student Conference with faculty, students,
administration, and staff. In addition to external speakers
who presented information about best practices for support
and intervention with FGC students, there also was opportu-
nity for institutional self-reflection and identification of
existing support structures and resources yet to be identified.
One of the most powerful outcomes from the conference was
the verification of the sense of isolation felt by FGC/FGI stu-
dents, of which we had had anecdotal evidence. SUNY-OW
has instituted an awareness campaign which includes estab-
lishing a webpage on the college website with information
about available resources specifically for FGC/FGI students,
a regular series of conversations with FGC/FGI students and
faculty who are themselves FGIs and of whom many are first
generation to college in their families. SUNY-OW has a
Freshman Year Experience (FYE) program dedicated to
introducing students to the social justice mission of the col-
lege. In the first semester, all freshmen (less than 24 college
credits) enroll in a seminar, The Ethics of Engagement:
Educating Leaders for a Just World. In their second semes-
ter, all first-year students must participate in a community
action, learning and leadership program that is a course
embedded community-based learning program. Last year,
FYE staff and administrators conducted surveys with our
freshmen cohort for early identification of FGC/FGI stu-
dents. This year, the authors of this article are collaborating
with the FYE administrators and staff, and have begun a for-
mal study consisting of online surveys, structured interviews,
and focus groups to collect data on nativity, countries of ori-
gin, parental educational background, and generational sta-
tus to disaggregate the data in a more meaningful way.
Through such an approach, we aim to disaggregate subethnic
group data to develop appropriate predictive analytics for
college students. We know these factors play a significant
role in our students' academic achievement, persistence, and
motivations for degree completion and aspirations beyond a
college degree. Thus, fine-grained analyses on the associa-
tions of our students' background demographic factors with
other parameters related to academic performance and reten-
tion will enable us to develop targeted interventional pro-
grams for our diverse undergraduate students.
Conclusion and Future Considerations
on College Student Diversity Needs
In summary, it is of critical importance to truly operational-
ize the term diversity in the context of today's multicultural
undergraduate student population as it relates to their aca-
demic achievement. At SUNY-OW, we are honored to con-
tribute to this special edition on student diversity for SAGE
at a time when our school is celebrating its 50th Anniversary
as one of the most diverse public 4-year undergraduate col-
leges with a socially conscious curriculum (i.e., Ethics of
Engagement: Educating Leaders for a Just World) within the
country (Anker & Feder-Marcus, 2013). We want to promote
an increasing national dialogue on social consciousness and
further to disaggregate data on diversity. We are currently
doing so within our college, in the hopes of becoming a pio-
neering example within our increasingly diverse nation. It is
our opinion that disaggregating URM data will increase the
social sensitivity in identifying factors that will close the aca-
demic achievement gap and promote educational equality for
all the diverse groups, which create our great nation. The
need to move away from the OMB categorization of "diver-
sity" is timely, as the number of diverse URM students is
rapidly increasing and major governmental programs such as
those in the STEM fields critically rely on this information.
Similarly, the new "terms/descriptors" which would evolve
from the disaggregated data should be monitored and updated
to reflect changing diversity predicted over the next 10 to 20
years, to really serve the needs of our nation's increasingly
diverse college student body. Perhaps Lechat (2001) had said
it best . . .
equity concerns arising from the enormous diversity that
students represent--in culture, language, prior educational
experiences, home situations, learning styles, attitudes toward
learning, and future aspirations. This diversity requires a level of
individualization that traditional education has never been
designed nor equipped to provide. The twin mandates of equity
and accountability have made it imperative that educators base
decisions on accurate and meaningful data about student
learning and achievement. (p. 15)
