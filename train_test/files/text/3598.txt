Abstract
We report some new observations on what could be regarded as the world's simplest visual
illusion--the autokinetic effect. When a single dim spot of light is viewed in a completely dark
room, it moves vividly in random directions. During steady fixation, perhaps subtle eye movements
cause the image to move and a failure to correct for this using eye movement command signals
leads to motion perception. This is especially true because eye muscle fatigue can lead to
miscalibration. However, if two dots are shown, they often move independently in different
directions, which negate the eye movement theory. In addition, two lines defining a single cross
sometimes uncouple and slide past each other and the fragments composing a hidden object move
independently until they click in place and the whole object is perceived--implying that the illusion
occurs relatively late in visual processing. Finally, the effect is modulated by vestibular stimulation;
anchoring your sense of self may be a prerequisite for binding features into coherent objects.

Stimuli were small strips of luminous paper mounted on a white wall such that in complete
darkness only the spot(s) were visible - allowing us to observe the autokinetic effect (Gregory
and Zangwill, 1963; Schweizer 1857). Subjects viewing the display reported seeing
movement--either immediately or after a latency. As with many perceptual illusions, a
small proportion of people never (or very rarely) experience the effect (6 out of 34 total
participants).
Next, subjects were asked to watch two adjacent dots (with one eye closed) and to indicate
on the keyboard whether the dots moved in unison (holding one key) or were uncoupled
(holding another key). We report the results of two formal experiments along these lines
followed by four informal demonstrations.

Experiment 1: Effect of Horizontal Separation Between Dots
We presented two adjacent dots each subtending 0.35 degrees with separation of 0.25, 1, 3,
10, and 17.5 degrees. Nine nai¨ve subjects were asked to view the display with one eye and
press the buttons on a keyboard to indicate whether the dots moved in unison or were
uncoupled (we could infer by default, the proportion of time they appeared stationary).
We found the dots were uncoupled and progressively more often as the separation
between dots increased--casting further doubt on any simple version of the theory that
the illusion is based on eye movements or reafference from commands (because the single
eyeball cannot move simultaneously in multiple directions) (Figure 1).
Experiment 2: Size Constancy
The perceived distance between two horizontally separated dots remains relatively constant
as you walk toward them; despite the rapidly increasing size on the retina. This is because the
brain takes into account distance cues and applies a correction to calculate the real physical
separation. We wondered, therefore, whether this effect occurs prior to, or after, the
autokinetic effect. In Experiment 1, we showed a monotonic relationship between
horizontal separation and duration of uncoupling. Comparing the results of the present
Experiment 2 (new nine nai¨ve subjects) to Experiment 1, it seems clear that moving
yourself closer to the display does not lead to equivalent uncoupling because the brain
uses subtle depth cues (e.g., from small amount of stray light as well as nonretinal cues

suggesting the illusion occurs after grouping by proximity.

such as accomodation and overall cognitive inference about the room layout) to infer
that the horizontal separation has not actually changed. The net result is the degree of
synchrony/asynchrony is roughly half way between perfect constancy and no
constancy--compelling evidence proving that effect does not occur early in sensory
processing (Figure 2).
Demonstration 1: Grouping Effects
We have seen in Experiments 1 and 2 that grouping by proximity results in the dots moving
synchronously whereas if the dots are far apart they uncouple and wander in different
directions. We wondered if other types of grouping also play a role. Figure 3(a) depicts
grouping by contrast and Figure 3(b) by orientation of lines--in both cases, grouping by
similarity resulted in uncoupling and independent movement of the two clusters. Four naive
subjects experienced this.
Demonstration 2
If you look at (say) two orthogonal lines forming an X shape in a fully lit room, you see it
exactly as it is. But when you view two luminous lines in darkness--they uncouple and almost
slide off each other! This implies that illusory motion signals are differentially applied to the
lines prior to the solution to the aperture problem. In addition, if one voluntarily stratified
the lines mentally--then the nearer of the two lines always appeared to slide over the farther

Figure 2. As in Experiment 1 (Figure 1), the dots were seen to uncouple more when they were far apart
from each other (dotted line). But if the subjects moved closer to the dot pairs they did not uncouple
equivalently--showing a partial size constancy correction (solid line).

(Figure 3(c)). Thus, image segmentation (aperture problem) and top-down processing can
strongly modulate autokinetic effect.
Demonstration 3
The top-down component was especially striking in the experiment using an illusory three-
dimensional (3D) Y shape defined by attached shadows (Figure 3(d)). The figure is initially
seen as mere irregular fragments by most people but eventually a 3D ``Y'' is seen.
Intriguingly, if luminous fragments are used, subjects initially see them moving
incoherently; though not always. But as soon as the fragments ``click'' into place forming
a 3D ``Y''; they always move together as a single object.
Demonstration 4
One might expect that binding of multiple attributes of the visual scene into a stable coherent
percept would also require prior anchoring of the observing self in one's body scheme--which
in turn is strongly modulated by vestibular input. Indeed, the strategic location of vestibular
cortex in the vicinity of polymodal parietal cortex makes it an ideal candidate for both
anchoring and binding; for example, patients with parietal lesions often have
somatoparaphrenia (denial of arm; Ramachandran, 2003) as well as illusory feature

conjunctions (caused by a failure of binding; Robertson, Treisman, Friedman-Hill, &
Grabowecky, 1997). Although vestibular modulation of autokinetic effect has been
observed before (Gregory & Zangwill, 1963; Nelson, 2001), we were curious whether the
degree of movement, coupling, and feature binding would be influenced by the procedure.
We used a portable noninvasive galvanic vestibular stimulation to modulate vestibular
function in six naive subjects. Five subjects reported that there was substantially more
illusory motion--and of these, four reported more coherence and binding during the
stimulation; most commonly a rocking or seesaw motion at 1 Hz (curiously, one subject
reported less binding). These informal observations suggest that vestibular modulation
does indeed occur. However, additional experiments are needed to confirm this.
We suggest that the brain creates multiple drafts of parallel sensory inputs on temporary
sketch pads before integrating them at various stages to create a subjective impression of
coherence and stability. In a room full of objects, the noise from parallel sources gets
averaged out to increase signal-to-noise ratio. However, in a cue impoverished environment
with a single luminous dot, such noise cancellation fails and the dot is free to wander.
Taken collectively, these experiments on autokinetic effect allows us to explore the laws of
cue integration and provide a novel approach to the binding problem and its relevance to
consciousness. In addition, far from being a curiosity, the illusion has relevance to our war
and defense; during the Gulf War, American scouts perceived a whole battalion of enemy
tanks move toward them and launched a counterstroke, failing to realize it was autokinetic
effect. Had the realization come any later, we might now be facing nuclear winter and would
not have written this article.
