Prevention on Cardiovascular Mortality in the United States
Adnan I. Qureshi, MD; M. Fareed K. Suri, MD; Jawad F. Kirmani, MD; Afshin A. Divani, PhD
Background and Purpose--We developed a model to estimate the costs incurred by ineffective primary and secondary
prevention in terms of excess cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a nationally representative sample of the US
population.
Methods--Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to examine the effect of inadequate risk factor control on the
incidence of fatal stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) during a follow-up period of 13.43.6 years after adjusting for
differences in age, gender, and ethnicity in a national cohort of 9252 adults who participated in the Second National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Mortality Follow-up Study. Inadequate risk factor modification
was defined by presence of either blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, serum cholesterol 200 mg/dL, or active cigarette
smoking. Using the data from 4115 adults screened in the NHANES 1999 to 2000, population attributable risk (PAR)
percent and associated cost incurred (expressed as proportion of total 1-year cost incurred for CVD mortality in year
2001) was estimated.
Results--CVD mortality risk increased in a stepwise manner for persons with no previous MI or stroke and 2
inadequately controlled risk factors (2); and previous history of MI and stroke and adequately controlled risk factors
(2.6), 1 inadequately controlled risk factor (4.3), and 2 inadequately controlled risk factors (5.7). The PAR was
14% (estimated cost incurred $13.2 billion) among persons with 2 inadequately controlled risk factors without
previous MI or stroke (estimated 17% of total US population). Among persons with previous MI or stroke, the PAR was
7% (cost incurred $6.2 billion) and 8% (cost incurred $7.4 billion) for 1 inadequately controlled risk factor and 2
inadequately controlled risk factors, respectively. An excess of cost of $13.6 billion was spent on 4% of the total
population (persons with inadequate secondary prevention).
Conclusions--The model demonstrates the differential risk of mortality from inadequately controlled cardiovascular risk
factors in primary and secondary prevention settings. The large financial cost incurred by inadequate primary and
secondary prevention justifies intensive efforts directed toward detection and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors.

It is estimated that 1 100 000 persons experienced myocar-
dial infarction (MI) and 700 000 persons experienced a
stroke in the year 2002.1 Improved control of modifiable risk
factors such as hypertension, cigarette smoking, and hyper-
lipidemia remain an important component of any efforts to
reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).2­5 It is
imperative to determine the financial burden of CVDs result-
ing from inadequate risk factor control in population subsets,
so that cost-effective interventions can be developed for ideal
target populations. We examined the financial burden of
cardiovascular mortality incurred by inadequate control of
cardiovascular risk factors in the setting of both primary and
secondary prevention in a representative sample of US
population.
Methods
Study Design
We used the data from the Second National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES II) Mortality Follow-up Study and
NHANES 1999 to 2000 to construct the model (Figure) to provide
cohort data on a large nationally representative sample of the US
population.
NHANES II Baseline Evaluation: Assessment of
Cardiovascular Risk Factors Status
The baseline survey of NHANES II was conducted between 1976
and 1980 for a national probability sample of 20 322 persons aged 6
months to 74 years.6 Blood pressure measurements, physical exam-
inations, health and dietary interviews, and serum cholesterol mea-
surements were performed as described previously.6­8 The diagnosis

of uncontrolled hypertension was made on the basis of average blood
pressure 140/90 mm Hg derived from 3 consecutive readings. This
criterion is based on threshold for defining hypertension in previous
studies.7 Uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia was defined on the
basis of serum cholesterol 200 mg/dL. The definition was chosen
to represent value considered elevated by the Adult Treatment Panel
III guidelines.9 Current smoking status was determined based on
self-report.
NHANES II Mortality Follow-Up Study: Incident
Cardiovascular Mortality
Mortality follow-up was conducted for the cohort of 9252 NHANES
II participants who were aged 30 years or older at the time of
enrollment through ascertainment of the vital status of each partici-
pant through December 31, 1992 by matching data with deaths
recorded in the National Death Index and the Social Security
Administration Death Master File 9. Underlying cause of death
according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9 CM) code was recorded.
Events of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and MI were
determined by death certificate diagnoses that included 1 or more of
the following ICD-9 CM codes: 433, 434, 436, 437.0, or 437.1 (for
ischemic stroke); 431 to 432 (for intracerebral hemorrhage); and 410
to 414 (for MI). Subarachnoid hemorrhage was not included because
of the small number of events (n3) observed in NHANES II
participants.
Calculation of Relative Risk of Incident
Cardiovascular Mortality
Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to estimate the relative
risks (RR) and 95% CIs for all CVDs including stroke and MI in the
following 6 categories of persons according to adequacy of risk
factor control: (1) No inadequately controlled risk factors and no
previous history of stroke or MI (reference group); (2) 1 inadequately
controlled risk factor and no previous history of stroke or MI; (3) 2
or more inadequately controlled risk factors and no previous history
of stroke or MI; (4) No inadequately controlled risk factors and a
previous history of stroke or MI; (5) 1 inadequately controlled risk
factor and a previous history of stroke or MI; and (6) 2 or more
inadequately controlled risk factors and a previous history of stroke
or MI. The analysis was adjusted for differences in age, gender, and
ethnicity.
National Health and Nutrition Survey 1999 to
2000: Recent Evaluation of Prevalence of
Inadequately Controlled Risk Factors
The model for calculation of financial cost incurred with inade-
quately controlled cardiovascular risk factors is dependent on the
proportion of the population in each subset stratified by adequacy of
risk factor control. The baseline data for the NHANES II data were
between 1976 and 1980. Since then, physician's practices may have
been modified based on the educational activities to develop and
implement guidelines for treatment of elevated cholesterol by the
National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)10 and recent stud-
ies documenting the benefits of antihypertensive treatment in pa-
tients with isolated systolic hypertension and hypertension among
diabetic patients.11 The most recent nationally representative sample
of 4115 US adults was screened in 1999 and 2000 as part of the
continuous NHANES (1999 to 2000).12 We determined the propor-
tion of patients in strata based on previous history of MI or stroke
and adequacy of risk factor control to estimate population attribut-
able risk (PAR) as described below. Statistical analysis was carried
out using WesVar (version 4.2; Westat). Variance estimation was
calculated using the delete 1 jackknife method. The calculated
proportions of the population exposed to inadequate control of risk
factor were representative of US population in 1999 to 2000.
Population Attributable Risk
To estimate the impact of inadequately controlled risk factors on
incident fatal CVD, we calculated the population-attributable risk
percent.13 PAR expresses the proportion of disease (fatal CVD) in
the study population that is attributable to the exposure (inadequately
controlled risk factors), and thus, could be eliminated if the exposure
was eliminated. The PAR percentage was calculated using the
following formula: where Pe represents the proportion of the
population exposed to the risk factor (inadequate control of risk
factor):
PAR%
(Pe)(RR-1)100
(Pe)(RR-1)1
Cost Incurred With Incident Cardiovascular
Mortality in 2001
The financial burden of inadequate control of risk factors of
cardiovascular mortality was estimated as the sum of cost incurred
for fatal strokes and fatal MIs during short-term hospitalization and
loss of productivity due to premature death for 1 year. Estimated
hospital cost was $10 000 for fatal stroke in 199714 and $5500 for
fatal MI in 1996.15 The cost of fatal stroke and fatal MI in 2001 was
estimated using the formula for calculating inflation and is (P2/
P11.00)100, where P2 is the most current value of the Consumer
Price Index-Urban (CPI-U),16 and P1 is the base value. The total
direct cost associated with fatal strokes and fatal MIs was estimated
as the product of cost incurred per fatal stroke or MI and total
number of fatal strokes or MIs that occurred in year 2001. The cost
incurred due to loss of productivity for 1 year was calculated by
dividing the estimated cost due to loss of productivity attribute to all
cardiovascular deaths as provided by the American Heart Associa-
tion.1 The cost incurred for each risk category was the proportion of
cardiovascular mortality that would be reduced if that risk category
were eliminated (calculated as PAR). We performed sensitivity
analyses by calculating the cost for the upper and lower limit (based
on 95% CIs) of both the RR of fatal cardiovascular events and
prevalence of inadequate risk factor control, and report the range of
results in each of the 6 categories of persons according to adequacy
of risk factor control. For example, the lowest possible estimate for
cost incurred in any category is based on PAR% derived from lower
values of 95% CI of the RR and Pe. These analyses were performed
to analyze the impact of relevant assumptions and statistical varia-
tions on cost estimates.
Effect of Inadequately Controlled Risk Factors on
Years of Life Lost
We performed Cox proportional hazards analyses to estimate the RR
and 95% CI for all cause mortality in 6 categories of persons
according to adequacy of risk factor control. We used the coeffi-
cients from the regression model and US life tables for 2001
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_14.pdf) to esti-
mate the years of life lost as described previously.17 The number of

years lost was the difference in expected ages between the 5
categories of persons with various risk factor control status and
expected age of the person without a previous history of MI or stroke
and adequately controlled risk factors.
Results
Table 1 demonstrates the baseline characteristics of 9252
participants enrolled in the NHANES II Mortality Follow-up
Study according to previous history of MI or stroke. A total
of 691 fatal cardiovascular events were observed; 565 were
MI and 126 were stroke during a mean follow-up period of
13.43.6 years.
The results of the analysis are shown in Table 2. Compared
with persons without a previous history of MI or stroke and
adequate risk factor control, the risk of incident cardiovascu-
lar mortality increased in a stepwise manner for persons with
a previous history of MI and stroke and (1) adequately
controlled risk factors (2.6), (2) 1 inadequately controlled
risk factor (4.3), and (3) 2 inadequately controlled risk
factors (5.7). The RR for all-cause mortality is presented in
Table 2. The years of life lost ranged from 1.9 years for
persons with no previous MI or stroke and 1 inadequately
controlled risk factor to 8.9 years for persons with a previous
history of MI and stroke and 2 inadequately controlled risk
factors.
The PAR was 14% for persons with 2 or more inadequately
controlled risk factors in the absence of previous MI or stroke
(17% of the US population; Table 3). Among persons with
previous MI or stroke, the PAR was 4% in the absence of any
inadequately controlled risk factor and increased to 7% and
8% in the presence of 1 and 2 risk factors, respectively.
Another way to interpret the results is that 14% of the incident
cardiovascular mortality in the population is related to inad-
equate control of multiple risk factors in persons without
previous MI or stroke. The estimated annual cost incurred, or
that which could be saved in this category because of
cardiovascular mortality, is estimated to be $13.2 billion.
Among persons with previous MI or stroke (2% of the US
population), 2 inadequately controlled risk factors ac-
counted for 8% of the incident cardiovascular mortality (total
cost incurred is $7.4 billion; Table 3). An estimated 7% of
incident cardiovascular mortality is related to 1 inadequately
controlled risk factor among persons with previous MI or
stroke (2% of the US population) leading to a total incurrent
of $6.2 billion.
Sensitivity analyses estimated the cost incurred ranging
from $5.5 to $22.1 billion for persons with 2 or more
inadequately controlled risk factors in the absence of previous
MI or stroke. The estimated cost incurred ranges between

Discussion
Salient Findings of the Study
We have developed a model that defines the population
attributable mortality risk associated with failure to control
modifiable risk factors. When the excess risk and cost
incurred is computed, persons with inadequate secondary
prevention efforts incur a cost of cardiovascular mortality
estimated at $13.6 billion ($6.2 billion and $7.4 billion for
persons with 1 and 2 or more inadequately controlled risk
factors, respectively). This is almost the same as the cost
incurred by inadequate primary prevention efforts estimated
at $13.2 billion (Table 3). The total cost of $30.1 (range $13.3
to $54.4) billion incurred by inadequate primary and second-
ary prevention of CVDs represents 3% of the $1.3 trillion
spent on health care in the United States in 2001 (http://
www.cms.hhs.gov/). Our results call for major efforts di-
rected toward primary and secondary prevention in subsets of
the population at highest risk for cardiovascular events.
Relative Impact of Primary and Secondary
Prevention on Survival
The years of life lost ranged from 1.9 years to 8.9 years for
persons in various categories of inadequately controlled risk
factors. Two prospective studies18 evaluated the long-term
mortality for persons with low risk defined as serum choles-
terol level 200 mg/dL, blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg,
and no current cigarette smoking. Estimated greater life
expectancy for low-risk groups ranged from 5.8 years to 9.5
years compared with those who had elevated cholesterol
level, or blood pressure, or smoked. Grover et al19 compared
the potential years of life saved between high-risk patients
(presence of hyperlipidemia, cigarette smoking, and hyper-
tension) and low-risk patients (presence of hypertension or
hyperlipidemia). The forecasted benefits of lipid-lowering
therapy were substantially greater among high-risk groups
versus low-risk groups in primary prevention (4.7 years
versus 2.5 years, respectively) but similar in secondary
prevention group, (4.6 years versus 3.8 years, respectively).
The results for hypertension therapy also demonstrated
greater benefits for high-risk versus low-risk patients under-
going primary prevention therapy (1.3 years versus 0.9 years,
respectively), and the forecasted benefits in secondary pre-
vention were similar (1.3 years versus 1.0 year, respectively).
The investigators concluded that the expected benefits of
therapy among patients without cerebrovascular diseases are
greatest in the presence of other risk factors.
Issue related to Data Interpretation
The definitions of MI and stroke used to identify participants
with previous CVDs were based on self-reported physician
diagnoses. Bergmann et al20 compared interview reports with
hospitalization records in 10 523 participants from the
NHANES I. A true positive rate of 83% was observed for the
294 self-reported MIs. O'Mahony et al21 validated the accu-
racy of assessing lifetime history of stroke in a random
sample of 2000 persons aged 45 years in a mailed ques-
tionnaire. Participants were asked whether they ever had a
stroke. Response accuracy was confirmed by medical records
review. The question had a sensitivity and specificity of 95%
and 96%, respectively.
We did not include diabetes mellitus as a modifiable
cardiovascular risk factor in the analysis. Whether aggressive
glucose control independently reduces the risk of cardiovas-
cular events is debated.22 Certain other limitations of obser-
vational studies including selection bias, missing data, mea-
surement errors, and lack of independent ascertainment of
events need to be considered in the interpretation of data. We
cannot rule out the possibility that mortality with CVDs
estimated from NHANES II may be lower in 2001 because of
improvement in treatment strategies independent of risk
factor control and, therefore, the cost incurred may be lower
than the estimated cost. We have provided the lowest and
highest estimation of the cost incurred as mentioned above.
PAR is calculated from estimates of the relative risk and
the prevalence of the risk factor.13,23 However, if the risk
factors are clustered within individuals, PAR is an overesti-
mate of the effect of a risk factor. Because cardiovascular risk
factors do cluster within individuals, PAR may overestimate
the effect of a single risk factor. In addition, adequate
treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia may not
reduce the risk of CVDs to that observed in nonhypertensive

persons with normal cholesterol. Therefore, the actual cost
benefit may be lower than the estimated value.
Conclusion
The model demonstrates that the cost benefits with interven-
tions to treat hyperlipidemia or hypertension or reduce
cigarette smoking may be substantial, particularly when the
combined benefits on fatal cerebrovascular and coronary
events are considered together.
