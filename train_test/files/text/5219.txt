Introduction
Issue publics are groups that connect the broader public to
elites and policy processes, thereby helping to save demo-
cratic governance from mass political ignorance.
But who or what holds an issue public together? The
"issue" in issue public does, in part, by defining the scope
of salience. We explore how the "public" part also defines
the contours of issue publics. Specifically, we argue that
individuals express their policy attitudes as a function of
social context and through a process we term "residual
group saliency."
Using survey data from a large national sample of
Americans, we evaluate the attitudinal consequences of
familial ties to veterans, core members of a foreign-policy
issue public. Consistent with existing research, we find that
veterans are more supportive of the War in Iraq than civil-
ians (Gartner 2008; Mueller 1973), and that civilians who
are related to a veteran support war more than unconnected
civilians (Gartner, 2008; Lau et al., 1978).
The concept of "issue publics" motivated revisions to
the view of citizens as political actors who fall short of their
democratic charge (Converse, 1964; Krosnick, 1990). Not
every citizen is uniformly vigilant of government on all
issues all of the time. Instead we have many policy watch-
ers who are knowledgeable about their issues (Delli Carpini
and Keeter, 1996; Hutchings 2003; Price et al., 2006), who
evaluate political candidates on the basis of their issue
(Anand and Krosnick, 2003; Highton, 2004; Hutchings,
2003) and who participate in politics on behalf of their
issue (Campbell, 2002; Price et al., 2006). Our analysis
contributes to this scholarship by offering new evidence
that the attitudes held by veteran-connected civilians draw
them into the veteran issue public when veteran density is
high, but leave them out when veteran density is low.

Abstract
The article focuses on group-based features of issue publics and advances the concept of residual group saliency as a
way to organize members of issue publics. We accord veterans exemplar or prototype status, and civilians as periphery
members of this issue public. As issue public exemplars, veterans anchor the "right" attitudes and behaviors for the
veteran issue public, and civilians, especially those with family ties to veterans, gravitate toward those exemplar attitudes.
We argue that pressure to conform to these "right" attitudes among civilians who are connected to a veteran is greater
when there are more veterans in their environment. However, veterans and civilians who are not connected to a
veteran are not responsive to such contextual effects, the former because they are already exemplars, and the latter
because there is no motivation to evaluate the self in relation to veterans. We test and find support for these claims
using data from the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. We conclude with an evaluative discussion and
suggestions for future research.

veterans in their surroundings makes no difference because
there is no residual group saliency to activate. We conclude
by discussing the implications of our findings for future
research.
The group component of issue publics
The core thesis of the issue public concept is that people
vary in the personal importance that they attach to their
policy attitudes (Converse, 1964; Krosnick, 1990).
However, for issue publics to form in the first place, the
importance attached to a particular issue must be shared
with others. The central premise of this study is that issue
importance is shared, and sharing renders issue publics
subject to group dynamics.
Groups play a central role in the study of attitude forma-
tion and political behavior (Campbell, et al. 1960). They
mediate our complex social environments by helping us
sort more from less relevant facts, and they orient our inter-
ests in policy and candidate judgments. Thus, when we
identify strongly with a group, we attach greater impor-
tance to issues that we believe may impact the status of that
group (Key, 1961). Whether salience is activated because
our group is in the political spotlight, or because fellow
group members are highly concentrated in our local envi-
ronment (Lau, 1989), groups are heuristics that help us as
consumers of political information and practitioners of
civic engagement.
The influential social identification model of group
behavior, along with a self-categorization variant, guides
our work here (Huddy, 2012). This approach posits that cat-
egorization is key to understanding group-driven behavior
(Tajfel, 1981; Turner and Tajfel, 1979), and stipulates that
individuals are motivated to be seen favorably, and hence
intergroup relations are competitions for positive identity.
One powerful insight uncovered by this model is that, even
absent face-to-face contact and a common purpose, the
mere perception of belonging to a group is sufficient to
induce differential group member/non-member behavior
(Jackson and Sullivan, 1987; Tajfel et al., 1971).
Many other insights have been produced by the social
identity and self-categorization approach. Two are worth
underscoring here. First, group identification is distinct
from group membership. The mere presence or absence of
characteristics that determine objective membership, such
as job status, race, and sex, need not be accompanied by a
specific feeling of attachment (Huddy, 2012: 739). Our
concept of residual group saliency builds from the inverse:
an individual need not be an objective member of a group
in order to express attitudes consistent with the group--
they need only feel a sense of closeness to the group or its
members.
Second, later advances in social identity theory have
emphasized the role of prototype group members in struc-
turing intra-group dynamics. According to Hogg (2001:
187), prototypes are abstractions based on "fuzzy sets of
attributes that define and prescribe attitudes, feelings, and
behaviors that characterize one group and distinguish it
from other groups." Individuals use prototypes as exemplars
to assess themselves and others by the extent to which they
embody prototype attributes (Hogg and Hains, 1996). As
Hogg (2001: 187) explains, a "prototype-based social attrac-
tion gradient" governs in-group favoritism and out-group
antipathy, as well as more or less liking of in-group mem-
bers. The implication for policy attitude formation in issue
publics is that prototypes find expression as leaders who
anchor the "correct" attitude, while followers seeking to
maximize similarity between self and prototype, conform.
Political science does boast behavior models that empha-
size leadership. Stimson (2004: 21) posits that those with
less knowledge and interest in politics are willingly influ-
enced by opinion leaders. In models of political mobiliza-
tion, Uhlaner (1989) contends that "relational goods"
incentivize individuals to behave rationally in group con-
texts. For Uhlaner, individuals are embedded in social envi-
ronments, which include leaders who turn to loyalty appeals
to persuade group members because internal cohesion trans-
lates into power outside the group (Uhlaner, 1989: 391).
The claim here is that issue publics, like groups in gen-
eral, have leaders and followers. The "core" of issue pub-
lics are opinion leaders who exemplify the prototypical
attitude, and have incentive to "expand the scope of con-
flict" (Schattschneider, 1960). Furthermore, periphery
members of issue publics have incentive to conform to atti-
tudes expressed by core members, and leader influence can
extend to objective non-members who nonetheless main-
tain closeness to core group members in issue publics. Just
as group salience and social density prods objective group
members to identify with a group (i.e. Lau, 1989), so can
these forces extend to residual issue public members. The
more core members in the local environment, the greater
the incentive for periphery members of issue publics to
conform. The policy attitudes of issue public "core" mem-
bers and those without primary social connections to "core"
members, however, should not respond to such contextual
factors, and hence neither are candidates for expanding the
issue public. The former set of individuals is immune
because they are already "core" members, while the latter
set feels no pressure to evaluate the self against a prototype
that is not salient from their perspective.
Our theory is consistent with this aspect of their theory:
residual group saliency is compatible with the primacy of
attitude importance stipulated for the issue public construct.
Issue publics may have reference group antecedents
(Krosnick, 1990: 73), but they are not bound by objective
group membership. Political issues and politics need not
map perfectly to social group cleavages. Although the idea
that social context partially determines political attitudes is
not new (Huckfeldt, 1984), the study here explicitly links
context, social identity theory, and issue publics.
Krueger and Pedraza 3
Next, we evaluate how family ties and the density of
"core" issue public members in the local environment bind
the core and residual segments of the veteran issue public
together. We select the veteran issue public for analysis, in
part, because foreign policy remains stereotyped as an issue
that is not on most people's radar (Almond, 1950; Converse,
1964). Second, we are also keen to stimulate conversation
between literatures on the civil-military gap (Lau et al.,
1978), public support for war (Gartner, 2008; Gartner and
Segura, 1998) and issue public approaches that engage for-
eign policy attitudes (Anand and Krosnick, 2003; Claassen
and Nicholson, 2013). Our effort to bridge these literatures
begins with the concept of residual group saliency, a small,
but critical step towards theorizing how issue publics might
expand, contract, and maintain cohesion.
Methods
We analyze individual-level survey data from the pre-elec-
tion wave of the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election
Study. The survey includes 55,400 respondents, with repre-
sentative samples of all 435 Congressional Districts. We
use a dichotomous measure of support for the Iraq War as
our dependent variable. Logistic regression models control
for known correlates of war support, including local war
casualties, respondent partisanship, income, education,
age, and sex.
Predictors of interest are respondents' connections to
veterans, congressional district veteran population density,
and their interaction. Respondents are categorized for anal-
ysis in two ways. The first model estimates support for the
Iraq War by comparing veterans to civilians. This model
represents approaches that assume only objective group
members are influenced by salience-increasing contextual
variables. The second model broadens the scope of poten-
tial issue public members by comparing veterans, civilians
with veterans in their immediate family, and civilians with-
out a familial connection to veterans. This approach tests
the idea that civilians living with veterans respond to con-
textual cues that increase the salience of the veteran issue
public, not because the cues activate a veteran identity, but
rather because they activate a residual form of that identity,
which in turn can expand an issue public.
Our contextual measure of group saliency is the propor-
tion of the population that claims veteran status in the
respondent's congressional district; we draw the measure
from the 2009 American Community Survey. The distribu-
tion of the veteran density variable is approximately nor-
mal (min = 0.1%, max = 13.4%, mean = 7.3%, s.d. =
2.1%). We expect that higher values on this index will
increase the salience of veterans for all civilian respond-
ents, represented as an interaction term, Veteran X Vet
Density. The more "core" members of the veteran issue
public in the social context, the more pressure to conform
to the prototypical attitude of the veteran issue public.
However, not all civilian respondents are equally embed-
ded in the veteran social context. Respondents related to
veterans will be more strongly influenced by the density of
"prototypes" in their context than civilians without the
family connection. Evidence of this pattern would extend
existing literature on the relationship between group mem-
bership and contextual effects. We capture that possibility
with a pair of interaction terms in the statistical model: one
for military-connected civilians (Vet connected civilian X
Vet density), and another for civilians who are not con-
nected to a military service member (Unconnected civilian
X Vet density). In both cases, the baseline comparison
group is veteran respondents.
Findings
The analysis begins by estimating the effect of veteran den-
sity on respondent attitudes that the War in Iraq was not a
mistake. Model 1 in Table 1 indicates that veterans are dis-
tinct from non-veterans in their belief that the War in Iraq
was not a mistake ( = 0.410, s.e. 0.119, p<0.01). The mul-
tiplicative interaction specified in the model is also statisti-
cally significant ( = -0.028, s.e. 0.015, p<0.1), which
means that veterans are more likely than non-veterans to
express such a view at the lowest values of our measure of
veteran density. Just how different are veterans from non-
veterans across the full range of veteran density?
Figure 1 traces predicted probabilities culled from
Model 1, and captures the overall low popularity of the War
in Iraq among Americans by 2010. At the lowest values of
veteran density the figure illustrates a probability of about
30% that veterans express support for the war (Iraq was not
a mistake), while non-veterans at 22% are less likely to do
so. The 8-point difference between veterans and non-veter-
ans closes as the share of veterans in the local population
increases, suggesting expansion in the veteran issue public
on the matter of the War in Iraq. Importantly, it is move-
ment among non-veterans that closes this gap, a pattern
consistent with the theoretical model that specifies "core"
issue public members as anchors, and residual group mem-
bers as potential members whose attitudes gravitate toward
those expressed by the issue public prototype.
We further explore whether this relationship between
civilians and veteran density is driven by civilians who are
connected to veterans. We showcase this effort with Model
2 in Table 1, which divides civilians into two groups--
those with familial ties to military service members and
those without--allowing the attitudes of each to be differ-
entially influenced by veteran density as specified with
separate interaction terms. The model fit to data indicates
that relative to veterans, and at the lowest levels of veteran
density, both connected and unconnected civilians are less
likely to say that the War in Iraq was a mistake. To illustrate
the magnitude of this difference and how it changes over
the full range of veteran density, we turn to Figure 2.
4 Research and Politics 
Like predictions extracted from Model 1, those from
Model 2 shown in Figure 2, indicate that veterans behave as
attitudinal anchors when it comes to the War in Iraq. Unlike
the pattern observed in the first figure, however, this second
figure shows that movement toward "prototype" attitudes is
only among civilians with family ties to veterans. From the
lowest to the highest observed values of veteran density, the
veteran-connected in the sample are about 8 points more
likely to say that the War in Iraq was not a mistake (about
23% to 31%). The difference relative to veterans across the
full range of veteran density values shifts from a -7 point
difference at the low end of veteran density, to a +2 point
difference in congressional districts with the highest
proportion of veterans. While the 95% confidence bands
around the estimates overlap at extreme values of veteran
density, the model estimates clear moderating effects of
veteran density for the attitudes of civilians connected to
veterans. These residual issue public members respond to
the density of veterans in their surroundings, but their coun-
terparts who are not connected to veterans--those without
residual group salience to activate--do not.
As Table 1 shows, these key patterns are observed con-
trolling a variety of known correlates of war attitudes. In
the third column we report the analysis of model uncer-
tainty, a strategy for assessing the extent to which statisti-
cal relationships are sensitive to model specification.

Specifically, we use Bayesian Model Averaging as a tool
to assess whether a variable contributes to the model's
explanatory power. Figures reported in column three cor-
respond to P(! = 0|Y), the posterior probability of models
that exclude the variable of interest (Hoeting et al., 1999).
As we might anticipate, partisan identity, sex, and various
socio-economic indicators carry the day as explanatory
variables of attitudes toward the Iraq War. War casualties
offer little explanatory power, a finding that we address in
more detail below. However, the analysis also reveals pos-
terior probabilities of 54% and 85% for the indicators of
connected civilians and unconnected civilians, respec-
tively, as well as a 53% posterior probability for the inter-
active term. This is evidence that our selected specification
is not "cherry picked" from a larger set of possible alter-
native specifications that leave out or include different
variables or sets of variables. The Bayesian Information
Criterion score (BIC), which penalizes models with more
covariates, is lowered despite adding more variables. As a
general rule, BIC reductions between 10 and 100 are
"strong" evidence against the null (Raftery, Madigan, and
Hoeting 1997), which here is the expectation that veteran
density similarly effects veterans, veteran-connected
civilians, and unconnected civilians.
Our interpretation of the analysis emphasizes group
dynamics. However, the findings may reflect economic self-
interest. We account for this possibility with an indicator for
the 46% of sample respondents whose congressional district
contains a military base. The indicator distinguishes the
presence of military bases from veteran density, and con-
trols the effect of supporting war because one's economic
status is linked to military bases, like people who live or
work on base, or have business that depends on base popula-
tion. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 1 show that living in a dis-
trict with a base is positively associated with support for the
War in Iraq, but there is high model uncertainty about this
result as column three indicates (poster probability of 26%).
Analysis reported in the online supplement replicates Model
2 using only the sample respondents whose congressional
district does not contain a military base. We find similar
results as those shown in Table 1 and Figure 2 (in fact,
slightly stronger). Economic self-interest, measured through
proxy of military base, has an independent association with
support for the War in Iraq. However, even controlling this
factor, we still observe a differential moderating impact of
veteran density for civilians connected to a veteran, not vet-
erans themselves, whose economic fortunes, one presumes,
would be the most tied to war.
Evaluative discussion
The preceding analysis has investigated attitudes toward
the War in Iraq in 2010. We argued that issue publics can be
thought of as groups. These issue publics consist of leaders
and followers, or "core" and "periphery" members. The
residual group saliency argument is that military veterans,
"core" members of the veteran issue public, exemplify pro-
totypical attitudes, and residual group saliency activates a
pressure to conform to prototypical attitudes among civil-
ians with family ties to veterans. This effect is greater
where there are more "core" members, but does not register
for those civilians without a family tie to the military. Issue
publics can grow, but the source of that growth is more
available from some segments of the public than others.

6 Research and Politics 
The empirics we report are compatible with extant
research on support for war, including the general pattern of
greater support among veterans (Gartner, 2008; Mueller,
1973), and that social ties to veterans typically translates
into greater support for war (Gartner, 2008; Lau et al.,
1978). The qualified exception is that we find no statistical
association between the number of war casualties and the
view that the War in Iraq was not a mistake. This appears
contrary to research that shows casualties are a major factor
in determining public support for war (Gartner and Segura,
1998; Mueller, 1973). However, as Gartner and Segura
(1998) point out, the impact of casualties is temporally
structured, such that deaths occurring closer to the point of
war initiation are weighted more than those nearer to the
close of war. The combined temporal proximity of the
Great Recession (2007­2009) with the temporal distance of
the 2007 surges in Iraq War casualties mitigated the differ-
ential local effect of casualties.
By the time data from the survey that we analyze were
collected, foreign policy issues were eclipsed on the
national agenda by domestic concerns. However, just
because an issue falls off the public agenda does not mean
that its issue public disappears. That is the point of the issue
public concept; for some Americans an issue remains
important, regardless of its rise and fall on the public
agenda. The study here suggests that even when the many
are not attentive to an issue, the issue public itself, though
they may be few, can generate issue public expansion.
This insight motivates further engagement with existing
lines of inquiry. For example, we might further reconcile the
findings here with research on casualties and support for
war by replicating our analysis at the start and at the mid-
point of the War in Iraq. For scholars of the civil-military
gap, residual group saliency suggests that the division
between veterans and the rest of the public need not be so
stark. The concepts of prototype and periphery might help
organize investigations of other attitudes and behaviors
within and between veterans and their civilian counterparts.
Fruitful synthesis might also be achieved with research that
explores social network ties to war casualties as determi-
nants of war attitudes and vote choice (e.g. Gartner, 2010).
Just as a "prototype-based social attraction gradient" gov-
erns in-group favoritism and out-group antipathy (Hogg,
2001: 187), perhaps variation in strength of social ties struc-
tures war-related attitudes and behaviors (e.g. distinction by
family, friend, co-worker or neighbor). Finally, is there an
analogous "strength of weak ties" pattern (Granovetter,
1973) to issue public attitude formation and political behav-
ior influences, in general? These questions are clearly
beyond the scope of this study, but ones that are relevant to
understanding issue publics and political behavior more
generally. Whichever line of inquiry is further developed in
research about issue publics, scholars benefit from the new
theoretical and empirical grounds about the structure and
dynamics of issue publics that our analysis provides.
