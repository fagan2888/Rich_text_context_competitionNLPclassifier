Introduction
The concept of Public Value as a normative management
construct has become popular in the public administration
discipline over the past 15 years (Alford & O'Flynn, 2009;
Bozeman, 2002, 2007; Moore, 1995; Shareef, 2008; Williams
& Shearer, 2011). Bozeman's (2002, 2007) work in this area
is especially instructive. His public failure model supports
the use of efficient market processes--to create Public
Value--by managers until these market dynamics reach the
point of creating public failure (i.e., unethical organizational
and social outcomes). Shareef (2010) calls this the market
efficiency/public failure model.
As such, some scholars see the Public Value framework as
a model of Ghoshal's (2005) intellectual pluralism, that is,
the sharing of normative management processes that chal-
lenge the influence of the non-normative Chicago School of
Economics in MBA education and the broader social sci-
ences. For instance, Shareef (2008, 2010) argues that the
Public Value construct (a) offers a tipping point for both
MPA and MBA students to determine when efficient market
process stops and public failure begins and (b) can be used as
a replacement paradigm for the Chicago School's non-nor-
mative organizational economics in triggering a transforma-
tion of the MBA curriculum. Likewise, Moore and Khagram
(2004) contend the Public Value construct should be used to
enhance the teaching of Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) in MBA programs.
Since the beginning of the decade, there has been a
demand in the management literature (Ghoshal, 2005;
Kanter, 2005; Mitroff & Swanson, 2004; Shareef, 2007;
Tsui, 2013) for a shift from both public and private organiza-
tions using economic efficiency as the sole determinant of
institutional success to a value system where ethics and effi-
ciency are co-equal determinants in assessing organizational
performance. The evolution of efficiency and ethics becom-
ing the criteria of institutional success has followed Kanter's
(2005, 2009) sociology of knowledge/demand-side organi-
zation change process. Kanter (2005) argues that organiza-
tion change is often predicated on ideas that are outliers in
one period of time and later become mainstream as a result of
demands placed on intellectuals (i.e., knowledge producers)
by social actors (i.e., knowledge consumers) because of rap-
idly changing environmental events. She writes,

Asymmetrical Information and Public
Failure in the Myriad Decision: Public
Value as a Mid-Range Theory in Legal
Studies' Antitrust Field
Reginald Shareef1,2
Abstract
The Public Value concept is a Public Management normative process that utilizes efficiency and ethics as co-equal determinants
to assess organizational outcomes. As such, Public Value represents what Ghoshal calls intellectual pluralism or the utilization
of normative management processes in the social sciences to challenge the intellectual absolutism of the Chicago School.
One discipline where Public Value can be used to assess normative results is Legal Studies' antitrust field. This research
applies Public Value criteria in evaluating the U.S. Supreme Court's 2013 ruling in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad
Genetics. The conclusions tentatively found the Court's decision will (a) create Public Value at the macro level but (b) trigger
public failure at the micro level for poor women because of an asymmetrical information network. This outcome fits with
Stiglitz's hypothesis concerning asymmetrical information and market failure. Further empirical research on Myriad's policy
is recommended.

In my early studies of the change process, I found multiple
tendencies coexist in organizations. At any one time, some are
core, some are peripheral. Much of the change involves nothing
really new--just bringing peripheral tendencies to the core.
(Kanter, 2005, p. 95)
Organization ethics, relegated to the periphery of man-
agement thought because of the triumph of market capital-
ism over socialism in the early 1980s, has now become the
core of management thought because of 21st-century corpo-
rate scandals (Kanter, 2005).
Tsui's (2013, p. 171) research also suggests that norma-
tive frameworks are now at the core of management theory
and practice. She describes the four types of organizations
now operating in the global economy: (a) classic for-profit
Friedman-model firms that are primarily concerned with
economic objectives; (b) some for-profit firms where eco-
nomics is still the primary objective but social responsibility
is a second-place contender; (c) social enterprises where both
social responsibility and economic objectives are primary;
and (d) charity-based non-profits which have social respon-
sibility as their primary objective and economics as a sec-
ondary objective necessary for survival. She sees accelerated
interdisciplinary movement from the Friedman model to
social entrepreneurial enterprises and notes these organiza-
tions feature both social responsibility and economics in
assessing performance success.
Consequently, the call to utilize Public Value's market
efficiency/public failure criteria to analyze the efficiency and
ethical outcomes in legal studies'antitrust field fits with both
Ghoshal's (2005) intellectual pluralism and Kanter's (2005)
demand-side change constructs. The Harvard School's pub-
lic interest approach has been largely dislodged by the
Chicago School's economic analysis paradigm over the past
30 years (Hovenkamp, 2010; Piraino, 2007). However, legal
scholars have been searching for a mid-range theory in the
antitrust field between Harvard's non-diagnostic public
interest framework and the "endless empirical inquiry of the
Chicago School" (Piraino, 2007, p. 368). This article sug-
gests the Public Value framework provides such a mid-range
theory in the legal studies discipline to assess the normative
outcomes of cases--using Stiglitz's (2001) asymmetrical
information/market failure model--like the U.S. Supreme
Court's 2013 ruling in Association for Molecular Pathology
v. Myriad Genetics.
The research question explored in this article asks the fol-
lowing: Using Stiglitz's asymmetrical information/market
failure assessment model, did the U.S. Supreme Court's rul-
ing in the Myriad case trigger public failure?
The article proceeds as follows. First, an overview of the
Public Value model is offered. The following section dis-
cusses (a) the battle for paradigm dominance in legal studies'
antitrust law between the Harvard School's public interest
approach and the Chicago School's economic analysis
framework and (b) how the Public Value construct can serve
as a mid-range theory in quick look antitrust cases. A discus-
sion of Joseph Stiglitz's asymmetrical information/market
failure construct is then presented. Next, the U.S. Supreme
Court's recent ruling in the Myriad case is assessed for Public
Value criteria and against Stiglitz's asymmetrical informa-
tion model. The Conclusion section summarizes key findings
concerning the sociology of knowledge-based paradigm shift
from Friedman-type profit maximization firms to organiza-
tions where efficiency and social welfare are co-determinants
of organizational and the role Public Value is playing in this
transformation.
Public Value: An Overview1
Bozeman's seminal 2002 Public Administration Review arti-
cle on Public Value outlines the praxis relationship between
public and economic value. His construct of public value
failure parallels economics'market failure concept and spec-
ifies criteria to determine achievement of Public Value or
diagnosis of public failure:
My goal is to develop a model that is analogous in many respects
to market failure, but that eschews concerns for price efficiency
and traditional utilitarianism in favor of a public-value focus. I
present a public-value-failure model that, like the market failure
model, includes criteria for diagnosing public failure (and
identifying public successes). (Bozeman, 2002, p. 146)
He argues that one of the primary triggers for both market
and public failure is imperfect information between buyer
and seller (Bozeman, 2007).
Bozeman (2002) sees his Public Value construct as a mid-
range theory: "In this article, I seek a `middle-range concep-
tualization'of public value, one pertaining to a wide range of
policy and public-value domains, but at the same time
anchored by diagnostic criteria" (p. 146). He lists seven cri-
teria that lead to public failure: mechanisms for articulating
and aggregating values, imperfect monopolies, benefit
hoarding, scarcity of providers, short time horizon, substitut-
ability versus conservation of resources, and threats to sub-
sistence and human dignity (Bozeman, 2002). Bozeman
(2002) calls threats to dignity and subsistence "The Greatest
Public Failure" (p. 154). In sum, when either market or pub-
lic management efficiencies violate any of these diagnostic
norms, public failure has occurred.
Shareef (2010) calls Bozeman's construct the market effi-
ciency/public failure model as Bozeman (2002) accepts the
economic assumption that market efficiency, in which prices
act as a coordinating mechanism, is an effective framework
to facilitate public agency delivery of goods and services.
Yet, Bozeman's (2002) analysis also recognizes that often
"prices lie" (p. 146). His model encourages managers to
engage in efficient market activities but articulates the public
failure criteria tipping points to prevent market efficiency
from leading to public failure (Shareef, 2010).
Shareef 3
Bozeman (2007) especially believes that the Public Value
construct has a role to play when determining the value of
scientific knowledge. He argues that economic criteria are
insufficient for valuing scientific knowledge as this form of
knowledge has many types of value and is broadly used in
the public domain: "Economists refer to this application
robustness as the `public goods characteristics of knowledge'
and cast it as a market failure" (Bozeman, 2007. p. 129). The
problem, Bozeman (2007, p. 129) argues, lies not in markets
but " . . . with the failures of market-based theories."2 Shareef
(2010), Moore (1995), and Moore and Khagram (2004)
believe that creation of Public Value enhances the social
legitimacy and political support of business enterprises,
especially those that operate in intensely political environ-
ments. Moore and Khagram (2004) specifically link social
and political legitimacy with CSR. They note that contempo-
rary corporate strategy focuses on competition in markets
with the goal of maximizing shareholder wealth.
Consequently, private sector entities tend to see customers,
investors, and shareholders as providing legitimacy and
support.
However, Moore and Khagram (2004) point out that busi-
ness organizations are not immune to the social context--or
social costs--of their operating environment:
The reason is simply that leaders and managers have substantial
de jure and de facto discretion in setting the strategy of the firm.
They can choose to accommodate or strain against the external
forces that society has erected around them. . . . There are prices
to be paid for these decisions. As part of developing corporate
strategy, a firm has to weigh the consequences of acting or
failing to act in accord with the legal, moral, or practical
standards that society has constructed for them--either through
law, or through the social expectations backed by the threat of
economic or political damage if they do not comply. In short, the
firm has to be concerned about the social and political legitimacy
of its strategy as well as its economic potential. (p. 17)
Moore and Khagram (2004) suggest that business firms
develop expertise in creating and measuring Public Value as
a means of developing social and political legitimacy. In
addition, Moore (1995) contends his mutually influencing
strategic triangle--Public Value/Organizational Capacities/
Legitimacy and Support--provides a framework for busi-
ness strategists to generate social and political support for
their enterprises. Importantly, Moore and Khagram (2004)
believe this societal legitimacy can only come from public
agencies:
Yet, this important work has been left off the map in most
discussions of corporate strategy. It is the kind of work that
could come to the fore and be more successfully integrated into
strategic business thinking if it was better understood that
business more systematically needed to develop legitimacy and
support from stakeholders beyond investors and customers and
understood that in an important respect, government can act as a
device for limiting and focusing the moral, legal, and social
vulnerability of business. Companies need a license to operate.
They need to be responsive to those who grant them that license.
(p. 23)3
Tsui's (2014) social entrepreneurial concept--where
social responsibility and economic objectives are co-equal
determinants of successful organizational outcomes--is a
popular form of CSR. However, only the Public Value con-
struct provides clear criteria to assess when market effi-
ciency stops and public failure starts. These criteria are
essential so both social entrepreneurial firms and non-prof-
its that establish credentials for CSR are not co-opted
(Selznick, 1948) by strictly for-profit businesses. Research
by Baur and Schmitz (2012) found that corporations often
co-opt the autonomy of non-profits by advancing notions of
CSR that don't facilitate the change of profit maximization
practices. When this occurs, both meaningful CSR develop-
ment and the image of the non-profit are negatively socially
constructed.
Corporate entities seem to be heeding Moore and
Khagram's (2004) advice on the linkage between CSR and
Public Value. For example, the day before the U.S. Supreme
Court heard oral arguments in April 2013 on whether Myriad
Genetics could patent the genes that determine hereditary
breast and ovarian cancer, the company's CEO, Peter
Meldrum, explained Myriad's position in a USA Today com-
mentary. Meldrum especially wanted to clarify the compa-
ny's social welfare policy on female access to the genetic
tests, irrespective of socioeconomic class:
We have done extensive clinical studies to help insurance
companies cover the testing. And patients can get second
opinions. The average out-of-pocket cost for a woman who
may be at risk for hereditary breast cancer is about $100. For
women who cannot afford it, we make the tests available for
free. And patients can get second opinions. We have partnered
with one ofAmerica's largest reference labs, major universities,
and cancer centers to offer confirmatory testing. (Meldrum,
2013)
Consequently, Bozeman's (2002, 2007) public failure cri-
teria--based on the same neo-classical economic criteria that
determines market failure--can be applied to assess public
and business sector outcomes (see Shareef, 2008, 2010).
Similarly, Moore and Khagram's (2004) strategic triangle
outlines how profit-making businesses need to create Public
Value--through interaction with regulatory agencies, the
media, and the courts--to maintain social and political legiti-
macy. As we shall see in a later section on the U.S. Supreme
Court's decision in the Myriad case, Bozeman's public fail-
ure model allows determination of whether public failure
occurred, while Moore and Khagram's (2004) framework
provides an understanding of whether Myriad's policy con-
cerning genetic testing accessibility met Public Value estab-
lished criteria for CSR.4

The Chicago School, Antitrust Law,
and a Mid-Range Theory
The late Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize winner in econom-
ics, is most closely identified with what is known as the
Chicago School of Economics worldview. Friedman (1953)
sought to develop a scientific model of management--called
Positive Economics--that omitted all ethics or morality from
the management process. Ghoshal (2005) explains, "Since
morality, or ethics, is inseparable from human intentionality,
a precondition for making business studies a science has
been the denial of any moral or ethical considerations in our
theories, and therefore, in our prescriptions for management
practice" (p. 77).
Friedman's theoretical construct is based on two related
assumptions: (a) all theories of human motivation are based
on notions of homogeneous, self-interested human behavior
and (b) because of human imperfection, the problem of social
organization is the negative problem of preventing bad peo-
ple from doing harm (Friedman, 2002). Moreover, the
Chicago School promotes agency theory to conceptualize the
negative problem (Shareef, 2011). Agency theory teaches
that since managers (agents) are not the owners (principal) of
firms, they will not act with the single purpose of an owner
to maximize profits. Friedman (2002) contends that maxi-
mizing shareholder value is the sole reason for an organiza-
tion's existence. When profit maximization is not achieved,
agency loss occurs.
The Chicago School's pessimistic view of human nature
and the role of organizations in society has had a profound
influence on various academic disciplines including soci-
ology, psychology, and anthropology. Ghoshal (2005)
writes,
Even practitioners of sociology and psychology, the starting
points of which as academic fields were defined by the
recognition that human behavior can be shaped by factors other
than conscious, rational self-interest have increasingly adopted
the notion of behavior being self-seeking as their foundational
assumption. Friendship ties of people are now analyzed by
sociologists as a means for individuals to use social networks to
influence their personal influence, power, or pay. (p. 82)
One academic discipline where the Chicago School has
become the dominant paradigm, but is rarely discussed by
the movement's critics, is legal studies. This is especially
true in the field of antitrust legislation and is primarily the
result of one extremely prolific, influential Chicago School
scholar--Judge Richard Posner of the U.S. Seventh Circuit
Court of Appeals (see Posner, 1976, 1979).
Until the 1970s, courts and government agencies assumed
that firms with market concentration would act in an anti-
competitive manner (Hovenkamp, 2010; Piraino, 2007).
This worldview is commonly known as the "Harvard School"
approach and it seeks to protect the public interest by pre-
venting--under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act--mergers, joint
ventures, or agreements that allow firms to gain monopoly
market power. Piraino (2007) describes this worldview as
follows:
In the middle of the twentieth century, Harvard economists such
as Edward Chamberlain, Edward Mason, and Joe Bain argued
that an industry's structure, that is, the number of firms in the
market and their relative sizes, determines how effectively firms
will perform in that market. (p. 348)
These scholars contend that when markets are concen-
trated, firms are more likely to engage in anticompetitive
practices (Piraino, 2007). Harvard's public interest approach
argues that courts should (a) be guided by Congress's desire
in enacting the Sherman and Clayton Acts to protect indi-
vidual competitors from the market power wielded by large
firms, (b) avoid market concentration even when it might
lower costs and prices thereby benefitting consumers, and (c)
engage a presumption of illegality when market monopolies
occur without engaging in a complicated analysis of eco-
nomic circumstances in the relevant market (Piraino, 2007).
While the Harvard School's non-diagnostic analysis
sought to utilize market concentration--based on a presump-
tion of illegality--to define the public interest concerning
market monopoly and antitrust law, the lack of economic
analysis made the paradigm susceptible to intellectual attacks
by the empirical-based Chicago School. By the 1960s,
Chicago School economists and law professors were chal-
lenging the Harvard School's non-economic approach to
analyzing antitrust cases. The late U.S. Supreme Court nomi-
nee Robert Bork's (1966) article, Legislative Intent and the
Policy of the Sherman Act, argues that antitrust laws were
designed to increase the efficiency of the firms and thus the
economy. For Bork, efficiency and profit maximization were
synonymous as Piraino (2007) describes:
Bork defined economic efficiency in terms of conditions that
maximized wealth, and he equated wealth enhancement with
"consumer welfare," meaning lowered costs, reduced prices,
and increased amount of products and services desired by
customers. . . . All other possible goals of the antitrust laws,
including the protection of small businesses from the power of
large firms, were irrelevant. (p. 350)
Posner (1979) agrees with Bork's analysis of the Sherman
Act and argues that courts can no longer simply indulge in
the presumption of antitrust illegality based on market con-
centration. Rather, judges have to review economic analyses
that empirically demonstrate the adverse economic impacts
of particular types of monopolistic practice. Consequently, it
is no longer sufficient to show an enterprise merely pos-
sessed dominant market power: "In addition, plaintiffs would
have to demonstrate, through empirical evidence, that the
conduct at issue harmed consumers by increasing prices or
decreasing output" (Piraino, 2007, p. 352). Posner (1979)
succinctly describes the Chicago School's distinguishing
characteristic of antitrust analysis as being framed . . .
"through the lens of price theory" (p. 925).
Shareef 5
By the late 1980s, the Chicago School's economic analy-
sis paradigm had replaced the Harvard School's public inter-
est approach to analyzing antitrust legal issues (Hovenkamp,
2010; Piraino, 2007). Wright (2008) summarizes the Chicago
School's impact on U.S. Supreme Court rulings in the fol-
lowing manner:
The Chicago School's influence on antitrust law and policy has
been substantial, especially in the U.S. Supreme Court . . .
Indeed, the 1970s and 1980s were marked by a dramatic shift in
antitrust policies, a significant reduction in agency enforcement
activity levels, and calls for repeal of antitrust laws altogether.
(p. 5)
Wright (2008) predicts an even greater influence of the
Chicago School in antitrust cases with the Roberts' Court.
Posner's Chicago School antitrust economic analysis is
predicated on cost- benefit procedures that seek to improve
the consumer welfare of the individual. Wolfson (2001)
describes cost-benefit analysis from this perspective:
Benefits are then usually defined in terms of the change in
individual well-being that the policy induces, and costs are
usually measured in terms of monetary costs or resources
required to implement the project . . . Comparison of costs and
benefits thus requires the cost benefit analyst measure subjective
benefits in monetary terms. (p. 94)
Normative economists and organization theorists criticize
the Chicago School's cost-benefit analysis approach because
it "monetizes" important values--like a clean environment
or health outcomes--that are absolute, regardless of mone-
tary cost (Wolfson, 2001). Others criticize cost benefit analy-
sis for ignoring questions of fairness: "For example, a certain
policy may pass a cost benefit analysis but only at the
expense of the poor and minorities" (Wolfson, 2001, p. 95).5
Piraino (2007), a leading antitrust legal scholar, has called
for a mid-range theory to be utilized that fits between the
non-diagnostic presumptions of the Harvard School and the
empirical analysis of the Chicago School to determine the
consumer welfare effects of challenged anticompetitive
conduct:
To adopt an inquiry `meet for the case'as required by California
Dental, the courts and agencies should categorize all competitive
conduct on a continuum according to its likely effect on
consumers. In order to confirm that effect, the courts and
agencies will have to undertake varying degrees of inquiry
depending upon the type of conduct at issue. (p. 367)
In California Dental Association v. Federal Trade
Commission (1998), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
charged California Dental Association (CDA) with restrict-
ing two types of truthful, non-deceptive advertising: price
advertising and advertising related to the quality of dental
services. In a 5-4 ruling, the majority opinion of the U.S.
Supreme Court concluded the FTC's jurisdiction extended to
non-profits like the CDA and because the disputed anticom-
petitive efforts were not obvious in the case, more than a
quick look rule of reason analysis was required. The Court
uses three standards to assess anticompetitiveness: (a) per se
illegal (i.e., Harvard's Public Interest Model); (b) the quick
look rule of reason that does not exclude per se illegality but
screens evidence to determine if proffered pro-competitive
effects are plausible; and (c) rule of reason, the analytical and
evidentiary standard advocated by the Chicago School.
As a mid-range theory, Public Value would include con-
sideration of social costs in a quick look analysis. For
instance, the CDA restricted inexact references to price in
advertising (e.g., reasonable fees or low costs) and non-price
claims like "gentle care" or "satisfaction guaranteed"
(California DentalAssociation v. Federal Trade Commission,
1998). The FTC ruled that restraints on price advertising
were per se illegal while the Court's ruling required more
expansive economic analysis to determine if the claims of
anticompetitive effects of the price restrictions were valid.
As we will see in the next section, utilizing Stiglitz's
asymmetrical information/market failure model in a quick
look analysis would conclude that inexact price information
leads to both market failure and social welfare harm. As
such, the asymmetrical information flow would also trigger
public failure. The FTC in CDA reached the correct conclu-
sion but provided no empirical analysis to support its per se
illegality analysis. Using Public Value criteria and Stiglitz's
asymmetrical information/market failure framework would
make the quick look analysis a more robust mid-range theory
of liability in antitrust legal decisions.
Bozeman's Public Value construct meets the criteria
Piraino outlines for a mid-range theory:
Managing Publicness differs in that public value is preeminent,
not just one criterion to be balanced against others. Public value
is the starting point . . . Managing Publicness does not require
the courts or an agency to eschew market or quasimarket
approaches such as contracting and privatization. (Bozeman,
2007, pp. 176-177)
Therefore, the fundamental criterion of a Public Value
mid-range theory in antitrust law analysis would be whether
monopoly economic power represents a social welfare threat
to subsistence or victimization of the poor.
Bozeman's examples of the selling of human organs
(2002) and prostitution (2007) are illustrative. Both activities
could be organized via monopoly power and would be
extremely efficient market processes (see, for example,
Levitt & Dubner, 2009). However, Bozeman (2002, 2007)
believes that despite obvious market efficiencies inherent in
both activities, each constitutes public failure because they
promote dehumanization and social cleavage (Bozeman,
2002).
He makes an interesting point, as well, concerning public
failure and institutional arrangements:
6 SAGE Open
Public values may be viewed as a criterion by which to judge
institutional arrangements for goods and services but should not
be confused by them. Thus, public values neither support
government action nor abjure markets; they are orthogonal to
both. Prostitution makes this case. If one agrees with Anderson
that prostitution has the effect of violating the individual
autonomy and that autonomy is a public value, then one might
well deplore both free markets for prostitution and government
regulated prostitution. (Bozeman, 2007, p. 137)
Joseph Stiglitz: Asymmetrical
Information, Market Failure, and Public
Policy Interventions
Columbia University economist Joseph Stiglitz won the
Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001--along with co-recipients
George Akerlof and Michael Spence--for his pioneering
research in the field of information economics or, more pre-
cisely, outlining the causal relationship between asymmetri-
cal information and market failure (including market failure
triggered by agency loss). Stiglitz (2001) believes that mar-
ket efficiency depends on symmetrical flows of information
and government has a role to play in facilitating informa-
tional transparency. Thus, he begins his Nobel Prize accep-
tance speech by stating,
Many of the major political debates over the past two decades
have centered around one key issue--the efficiency of the
market economy and the appropriate relationship between the
market and the government. The argument of Adam Smith, the
founder of modern economics, that free markets led to efficient
outcomes has played a central role in these debates. It suggested
we could, by and large, rely on markets without government
intervention. The view I present here undermined Smith's theory
and the view of government that rested on it. (Stiglitz, 2001, pp.
472-473)
Stiglitz (2001) argues that for over 100 years, economic
models were premised on the fallacy that information was
perfect. Moreover, he notes that even when economic model-
ing recognizes this fallacy, economists continued with the
models and merely hoped that " . . . economies in which
information was not too imperfect would look very much
like economies in which information was perfect" (p. 475).
His research shows this proposition is not true and that even
a small amount of information imperfection can have a pro-
found effect on market efficiency. Stiglitz (2001) provides a
simple example using the Chicago School's efficient market
hypothesis which contends that prices in the stock market
fully reflect all information. If this were true, he argues, there
would be no incentive for anyone to expend money to collect
information.
Likewise, Stiglitz (2001) attacks the Chicago School for
assuming that information imperfection is merely a transac-
tion cost that is in the price of a commodity:
In the approach of many Chicago economists, information
economics was just like any other brand of economics, one
simply analyzed the special factors determining the supply and
demand for information, just as agricultural economics analyzed
those factors affecting the market for wheat . . . Our analysis
showed that this approach was wrong, as were the conclusions
drawn from it. (p. 477)
Stiglitz agrees--concerning stock prices and transaction
costs--with Bozeman's (2002) assertion that often "prices
lie" (p. 146).
A major goal of Stiglitz's research is to demonstrate why
asymmetrical information flows persist. The reason was not
an invisible hand but deliberate managerial manipulation to
maintain monopoly power and profit maximization:
Similarly, the presence of information imperfections give rise to
market power; and firms can exploit this market power through
"sales" and other ways of differentiating among individuals who
have different search costs. The price dispersions in the market
were created by the market--they are not just the failure of
markets to arbitrage fully price differences caused by shocks
that affect different markets differently. (Stiglitz, 2001, p. 490)
What then is government's role in creating symmetrical
information and efficient market processes? Stiglitz (2001)
is no apologist for his belief in an activist Pareto tax policy
that redistributes income to achieve broad social outcomes:
One of the functions of government is to redistribute income;
even if it did not want to redistribute actively it has to raise
revenues to finance public goods and there is a concern that the
revenue be raised in an equitable manner. (p. 516)
Hence, the difficulty lies in creating a symmetrical infor-
mation flow so that government can maximize social welfare:
"The problem of the government maximizing social `profit'
(welfare) subject to information constraints, is closely analo-
gous to that of the monopolist, maximizing private profit sub-
ject to information constraints" (Stiglitz, 2001, p. 516).
Consequently, two criteria are involved in creating a sym-
metrical taxing policy: (a) what is observable and (b) the
social welfare function or attitudes toward inequality
(Stiglitz, 2001). To achieve market efficiency, cost shifting to
third parties cannot be hidden as the existing medical system
allows (see, for example, Shareef, 1984). Moreover, the
social welfare function for access to medical services in the
United States has long been accepted as a public good since
federal law (even before the Affordable Care Act) allows all
citizens to be seen in the nation's emergency rooms, regard-
less of market inefficiencies or ability to pay (Shareef, 2011).
Based on (a) Stiglitz's (2001) theory concerning symmet-
rical information leading to efficient market processes that
result in desired social welfare outcomes and (b) Bozeman's
Public Value criteria, the diagnostic tools exist to determine
Shareef 7
whether the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Myriad actually
resulted in the creation of Public Value or was the catalyst for
public failure.
The Myriad Ruling and Public Value
In the Myriad case, Myriad Genetics sought to patent two
human genes segments it discovered. They also sought to
patent Myriad's synthetic replica of those human gene seg-
ments. The discovery of these segments was important
because mutations of these segments provide indicators of
propensity for breast or ovarian cancer. However, the Court
found that Myriad was not entitled to patent protection of the
two genes because (a) products of nature cannot be patented
and (b) the grant of patents would tie up the basic tools of
scientific and technological work and inhibit future innova-
tion premised upon them (Association for Molecular
Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, 2013). Writing for unanimous
court, Justice Thomas outlined the anticompetitive aspects of
Myriad's patent claim:
Myriad's patents would, if valid, give it exclusive rights to
isolate an individual's BRCA1 and BRCA 2 genes. . . .The
patents would also give Myriad the exclusive right to
synthetically create BRCA cDNA. In Myriad's view,
manipulating BRCA DNA in either of those fashions triggers
its `right to exclude others from making' its patented
composition of matter under the Patent Act'. . . . Myriad also
filed patent infringement suits against other entities that
perform BRCA testing, resulting in settlements in which the
defendants agreed to cease all infringing activity. Myriad then
solidified its position as the only entity providing BRCA
testing. (pp. 6-7)
The Court did find Myriad could patent cDNA (synthetic
DNA) created in the laboratory and maintain patents on the
BRCA tests developed by the company. The majority opin-
ion also noted that Myriad can still make profit from other
existing gene patents it has procured and remains the only
company performing BRCA tests.6
Public Failure Analysis
The Court's ruling seems to fit Bozeman's (2002) market
efficiency/public failure criterion as it allows Myriad to sell
its patented BRCA test, but does not allow patents that would
bar or inhibit genetic research from other scientists on these
individual genes. Public Value is enhanced since (a) Myriad's
retention of patent control over its BRCA 1 and 2 tests repre-
sents an efficient market process and (b) it reduces the threats
to subsistence for women with health insurance.
The Myriad decision appears to uphold Bozeman's Public
Value construct of placing intrinsic value over economic
value in two fundamental ways. First, had the Court granted
patent rights to Myriad, the company would have stifled
innovation in the field by charging other research enterprises
prohibitively high costs to use the two gene segment for
scientific inquiry. Thus, the company would possess years of
a monopolized market for its BRCA testing and therefore
harmed the broader social welfare by impeding development
of competitive breast and ovarian diagnostic tests.
Second, the ruling is ostensibly consistent with Bozeman's
(2007) argument that " . . . economic currency is a poor sur-
rogate for valuing scientific knowledge" (p. 129). Often the
costs of a commodity's economic value and its public value
have little relationship. Bozeman (2007) finds that economic
costs attach a value to a commodity but that attachment says
nothing important about the value itself. Conversely, Public
Value does say something important about the value placed
on a commodity. In the Myriad decision, the unanimous
opinion essentially concludes that the high social costs of
granting the company patent rights over the gene segments
themselves outweigh Myriad's reduced profit margins. This
rationale also fits with Bozeman's Public Value value-prefer-
ence of protecting subsistence and human dignity.
However, public failure was created in the Myriad case
because the asymmetrical information barrier design for
poor women to access applications forms for the BRCA tests
creates both market and public failure. Low-income women
are required to download and read copious information to
apply for the BRCA tests. The Myriad webpage directs poor
women to a series of links that require downloading of a
Myriad Financial Assistance Application, Medical Criteria,
and Financial Criteria.
Yet, research shows that this type of Informational chal-
lenge often creates disincentives for the poor to effectively
utilize the American health care system. For instance,
Halpern, Ubel, and Asch (2008), in their study of medical
default settings, found that low-income patients having to
complete forms and obtain referrals often confront insur-
mountable informational barriers that mitigate effective
health care outcomes. Thaler and Sunstein's (2008) research
on enrollment in Medicare's Part D Prescription Plan reveals
that high enrollment rates of seniors were primarily the result
of automatic default enrollment--not information and forms
provided by the government--through Medicaid or the
Veterans Affairs. Consequently, many other eligible
Americans never enrolled in Medicare Part D because of
information overload.
Likewise, a recent Kaiser Foundation study found that
most of Kentucky's 650,000 residents who are eligible for
Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are confused
because of disinformation campaigns concerning the sup-
posed defunding of "Obamacare" (Galewitz, 2013). Thus,
because of deliberate information confusion about the
Affordable Care Act and Obamacare by political partisans,
ACA navigators are told that the Obamacare label is toxic
and avoid using it when explaining who is eligible for cover-
age under Medicaid expansion.
These information barriers, by design, constitute informa-
tion asymmetries and thereby trigger market failure. Stiglitz
(2001) notes that business managers have an economic
incentive to create asymmetrical information networks:
8 SAGE Open
While early work in the economics of information dealt with
how markets overcame information asymmetries, later research
turned to how markets create information problems, partly in an
attempt to exploit market power. Managers of firms attempt to
entrench themselves, increasing their bargaining power, e.g., vis
a vis alternative management teams, and one of the ways they do
this is to take actions which increase information asymmetries.
Doing so effectively reduces competition in the market for
management. (p. 490)
As previously noted, Bozeman (2007) argues that neither
a market process nor government regulation inherently deter-
mines whether Public Value has been created. The Myriad
case provides an interesting example of this paradox. It is
undeniable that the Court's decision does broaden social
welfare benefits at the expense of Myriad's profits. However,
because of asymmetrical information barriers for the poor to
utilize the company's cutting-edge medical innovations, par-
ticipation by eligible low-income women is likely to be
reduced. Stiglitz (2001) says these information barriers are
deliberate and designed to enhance profitability.
Based on Tsui's (2013) typology, Myriad appears to
remain a typical Friedman-type profit maximization organi-
zation that will take advantage of the poor via its established
asymmetrical information flow. If theory (Stiglitz, 2001) and
empirical evidence (Galewitz, 2013; Halpern et al., 2008;
Thaler & Sunstein, 2008) are indicative, the asymmetrical
information barrier will be so difficult for lower income
women to surmount that Myriad's profits will only be mar-
ginally impacted by giving the test free of charge to this class
of women. As such, the Myriad ruling will create public fail-
ure based on the Public Value criteria of threats to both the
subsistence for low-income women and to human dignity.
Bozeman (2002) is also concerned about the relationship
between imperfect information in health care (concerning
the selling of human organs) and exploitation of the poor
causing social cleavage in the broader society:
The same argument can be made against the trade in human
organs. If the person who takes the risk of living with just one
kidney turns out to have made a bad bet, then society, not just the
individual, suffers the cost. This is especially likely since the
sellers will come disproportionately from the poorer segments
of society, selling their "natural resource" to the wealthy. (p.
155)
Thus, the catalyst for public failure in both selling human
organs and the Myriad ruling are asymmetrical information
flows.
Public Value and CSR
As Myriad remains a Friedman-type profit maximization
organization, it also fails Moore and Khagram's (2004)
Public Value criterion test for establishing CSR-based social
and political legitimacy. A statement by the American
Medical Association's President Jeffrey Lazarus (2013)
applauded the Court's ruling and questioned Myriad's com-
mitment to the broader social welfare:
The American Medical Association (AMA) has long advocated
a clear prohibition against human gene patents. To ensure the
U.S. Supreme Court heard physicians' voices loud and clear, the
AMA joined with other health care organizations to file an
amicus brief in defense of the federal court ruling that invalidated
patents held by Myriad Genetics on the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2
genes consistent with the law . . . Removing the patents on the
building blocks of life ensures that scientific discovery and
medical care based on insights into human DNA will remain
freely accessible and widely disseminated, not hidden behind a
vast thicket of exclusive rights.
Conclusion
Several related conclusions can be drawn from this research
concerning intrinsic versus economic value in decision-mak-
ing and asymmetrical information.
First, Kanter's (2005) sociology of knowledge construct
accurately identifies the social context of organizational
change concerning the shift from Friedman-type enterprises
to organizations where intrinsic and economic values are co-
determinants of institutional success. Because of 21st-cen-
tury corporate scandals, the public now finds organizations
featuring social welfare norms more acceptable. Corporate
CEOs are also aware of this shift in attitudes. Myriad's
CEO's editorial in USA Today sought to portray his firm as
one exhibiting desired social welfare norms (Meldrum,
2013).
Kanter's (2005) framework suggests the U.S. Supreme
Court is also aware of this social shift in attitudes. Despite
Wright's (2008) prediction that Chicago School profit maxi-
mization norms will be the foremost value that justices on
the Roberts' Court use in determining Sherman antitrust
cases, a unanimous court in Myriad attempted to broaden the
concept of consumer welfare by placing intrinsic values over
economic values. The Court weighed the value of scientific
knowledge as a public good versus giving monopoly rights
to the owners of the most efficacious BRCA test in today's
market. Conversely, Bork (1966) and Posner (1979) would
have supported an opinion favoring Myriad.
Second, Bozeman's Public Value construct provides the
requisite diagnostic criteria--analogous to market failure in
neoclassic economics--to determine whether social welfare
has been achieved or public failure has occurred. Therefore,
Public Value criteria can serve, in case-by-case situations, as
a mid-range theory between the Harvard and Chicago
Schools in quick look antitrust cases. In the Public Value
theoretical construct, had the Court utilized established
Public Value cause and effect relationships between asym-
metrical information and victimization of the poor in a quick
look analysis in its Myriad ruling, the ruling would have
avoided public failure.
Shareef 9
However, the Court never considered the social costs of
asymmetrical information for poor women in Myriad because
of the dominance of the economics paradigm in the social
sciences, including law. Pfeffer (2005) notes,
In a word, Ghoshal is right. He is right in the sense that
economics is indeed taking over management and organization
science, just as it has taken over political science and law . . .
Ghoshal is right that this takeover matters because social
theories matter. The theories that come to be believed and
accepted affect both public and organizational policies and
practices. Moreover theories, once accepted, set into motion
processes that tend to become self-fulfilling. (p. 96)
Economic language now determines our collective social
construction of reality (see Berger & Luckman, 1967) and
affects what people see, what people ignore, and what people
think is important (Ferraro, Pfeffer, & Sutton, 2005).
Consequently, the Court in Myriad did not ignore the diffi-
culties of poor women attempting to access the BRCA tests
out of meanness or indifference. Rather, they ignored poor
women because of a social conditioning that leads to think-
ing solely about economic profitability and disregards the
social costs of organizational and public policy.
Bozeman's (2002, 2007) public-value-failure model and
Moore and Khagram's (2004) Public Value/CSR concept--
along with Tsui's (2013) social entrepreneurship--are all
manifestations of Ghoshal's (2005) intellectual pluralism
movement to require both (a) scholars in the social sciences
and (b) business and public sector leaders to consider social
welfare costs equally with economic profitability. These
ideas are moving from the periphery to the core of how to
define organizational success. As a result, we very well may
be witnessing a paradigm shift (Kuhn, 1970) in academic
and societal thinking about why organizations exist and the
inextricable link between profitability and social welfare
costs.

Notes
1. Weick (1995), in his Organization Sensemaking construct,
contends that there has to be an agreed upon point of refer-
ence to begin making sense of social phenomenon. For many
in the Public Management discipline, the point of reference for
understanding the Public Value concept begins with Moore's
(1995) book where he introduces the concept. However, my
point of reference for making sense of Public Value starts with
Bozeman's (2002) Public Administration Review article that
establishes criteria for determining where market efficiency
stops and public failure begins.
2. Bozeman and Sarewitz (2011) contend contemporary research
evaluation does an excellent job assessing scientific and eco-
nomic impacts; however, there is poor assessment of the social
outcomes of research processes. Hence, they provide public value
mapping criteria of science policy to evaluate public value failure.
3. Many Public Management scholars view the Public Value con-
cept as a unique normative management process that can only
be utilized in public agencies. Perry and Kraemer (1991, p.
5) introduced the concept of Public Management's uniqueness
by stating, "Although there is much that public management
shares with private management, it also has a unique con-
tent." Thus, these scholars tend to reject generic management
approaches that are applicable to both public and business
management processes. Williams and Shearer's (2011) review
of journal articles and books on the Public Value concept over a
15-year period is illustrative. Any research that applied Public
Value in a non-public organization setting was excluded from
their review, including Shareef's (2008, 2010) and Moore and
Khagram's (2004) research.
4. The National Basketball Association (NBA) Board of
Governor's recent forced sale of the LosAngeles (LA) Clippers
team by owner Donald Sterling provides an easy assessment
of both Bozeman's and Moore and Khagram's Public Value
frameworks. Although the LA Clippers are an efficient mar-
ket entity (the team is a playoff contender and valued at over
$500 million dollars), the NBA has banned Sterling (because
of recorded racist remarks made to a female acquaintance) for
life and forced him to sell the team. These comments violate
Bozeman's (2002) public failure criteria of "dehumanization
and threats to human dignity." When the comments were made
public, the players union threatened to boycott the 2014 play-
offs, corporate sponsors withdrew, civil rights groups staged
protests at Clipper games, and President Obama publicly con-
demned the racist statements (Berman, 2014). Consequently,
Sterling had lost all social and political support to remain the
owner of the team--although the team was economically prof-
itable--because of public failure.
5. While neo-classical economists like Belfield (2012) continue
to argue that cost-benefit analysis fits with the Public Value
construct, Bozeman (2002) explicitly rejects this linkage argu-
ing this analytical approach focuses solely on economic out-
comes and excludes social costs.
6. The Court announced its Myriad decision on June 13, 2013.
On May 13, 2013, popular celebrity actress Angelina Jolie
wrote an op-ed in The New York Times announcing that she
had undergone BRCA testing, was found to have an inherited
gene mutation, and made the decision to have a preventive
double mastectomy. The column focused public opinion on
the Myriad case. Much of Jolie's commentary discussed the
high cost of BRCA testing: "Breast cancer alone kills 485,000
people each year according to the World Health Organization,
mainly in low and middle-income countries. It has to be a
priority to ensure that more women can access gene testing
and lifesaving preventive treatment, whatever their means
and background, wherever they live." The cost of testing for
BRCA1 and BRCA2, at more than $3,000 in the United States,
remains an obstacle for many women.
