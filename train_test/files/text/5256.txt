Introduction
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an endocrine sys-
tem that plays a major role in the physiological regulation
of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis. Dysregulation of
the RAS is also thought to contribute to the development
and progression of cardiovascular and renal injuries.
Moreover, the pharmacological agents that block various
components of the RAS now encompass the primary thera-
pies for treatment of hypertension, heart failure and dia-
betic renal injury. Although originally identified as a
classic endocrine system, the evidence clearly reveals a
local or tissue RAS in various organs including the kidney,
heart, adrenals and brain.1­3 In this regard, an intracellular
system localized to cellular organelles including the
nucleus and mitochondria have been described in both the
tubular epithelial and mesangial cells of the kidney, as well
as the myocytes and fibroblasts of the heart.4­11 The physi-
ological relevance and the regulation of this intracellular
RAS have not been established. Indeed, it is not clear pre-
cisely how the intracellular system functions at the cellular
level to synthesize the active RAS peptides angiotensin II
(Ang II) and Ang-(1-7), nor the contribution of these pep-
tides to intracellular signaling and cell function. Moreover,
there is now compelling evidence for a functional renin
receptor that binds prorenin to non-proteolytically acti-
vate the enzyme, as well as to mediate the functional sign-
aling of the receptor that is not dependent on Ang II
generation.12­14 Interestingly, the prorenin receptor (PRR)
is primarily localized intracellularly rather than on the cell
membrane suggesting that the receptor may also contrib-
ute to a functional intracellular RAS.15
Elucidation of the physiological relevance of an intra-
cellular RAS is important clinically as well. The current

Abstract
Introduction: Isolated nuclei of sheep proximal tubules express angiotensin (Ang) receptors as well as angiotensinogen
(AGT) and renin. The present study characterized the NRK-52E tubular epithelial cell line for the intracellular expression
of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components.
Methods: RAS components were visualized by immunofluorescent staining in intact cells and protein expression in
isolated nuclei.
Results: An antibody to the angiotensin I (Ang I) sequence of AGT (AI-AGT) revealed only cytosolic staining, while
an antibody to an internal sequence of AGT (Int-AGT) revealed primarily nuclear staining. Immunoblots of nuclear and
cytosolic fractions confirmed the differential cell staining of AGT. Immunostaining for renin was present on nuclei of
intact cells. Nuclear renin activity averaged 0.77±0.05 nmol/mg protein/h that was reduced by aliskiren (0.13±0.01 nmol/
mg/h, n=3, p<0.01); trypsin activation increased activity three-fold. Peptide staining localized angiotensin II (Ang II) and
Ang-(1-7) to the nucleus and peptide content averaged 59±2 and 57±22 fmol/mg (n=4), respectively. Peptide metabolism
in isolated nuclei revealed the processing of Ang I to Ang-(1-7) by thimet oligopeptidase.
Conclusion: We conclude that the NRK-52E cells express an intracellular RAS localized to the nucleus and may be an
appropriate cell model to elucidate the functional relevance of this system.

therapeutic regimens to treat high blood pressure and
attenuate renal and cardiovascular injury include AT1
receptor antagonists (ARBs), angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE) and renin inhibitors; however, the thera-
peutic benefit of these agents to target the intracellular
system is not known. Previous studies in our laboratory
and others have demonstrated a high density of Ang II
receptors on isolated nuclei from the kidney.16,17 In the rat
kidney, the majority of these nuclear binding sites are the
AT1
subtype that is functionally linked to Ang
II-dependent increases in oxidative stress and cal-
cium.18,19 AT1
receptor-dependent formation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) was also demonstrated in isolated
nuclei from the sheep kidney; however, both AT2
and
Ang-(1-7) (AT7
) sites were functionally coupled to nitric
oxide formation and may antagonize the actions of the
nuclear AT1
receptor.20­22 Additional studies revealed the
precursor components angiotensinogen (AGT) and renin
in isolated nuclei from proximal tubules of the sheep kid-
ney that may portend for the intracellular or nuclear for-
mation of Ang II and Ang-(1-7).21 Moreover, we detected
the peptidase activities for ACE and ACE2 in intact
nuclei that processed exogenous Ang I to Ang II and Ang
II to Ang-(1-7), respectively.20 To facilitate our under-
standing of the tubular RAS within the kidney, the cur-
rent study sought to identify a renal cell line that expresses
the components of this system and to determine their
intracellular localization.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
Normal kidney proximal epithelial cells (NRK-52E) cells
were obtained from American Tissue Type Culture
(Arlington, Virginia, USA; passage 8) and maintained at
37°C in plastic 75 cm2 flasks in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium (DMEM/F12, Invitrogen) containing 5%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine and 15
mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid
(HEPES) buffer. The culture flasks were kept in a 95% air
and 5% CO2
humidified environment at 37°C. At conflu-
ence, the cells were washed and maintained in serum free
DMEM/F12 without supplements for 48 h prior to the bio-
chemical studies.
Nuclear and cytosolic fractions
Confluent cells were washed twice with Phosphate buff-
ered saline (PBS) and harvested. Harvested cells were cen-
trifuged at 1000 g for 10 min and the resulting cell pellet
was homogenized on ice with a glass pestle in 20 mM Tris
buffer containing 5mM MgCl2
and 25 mM KCl at pH 7.8.
Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 g to obtain the
crude nuclear pellet and further purified in a high sucrose
buffer. The crude pellet was reconstituted with 0.3 M
sucrose in 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.4, layered over the
0.88 M sucrose buffer and centrifuged at 1200 g for 10 min
at 4C to obtain the nuclear pellet.23 The cell supernatant
was centrifuged at 100,000 g for 60 min at 4C to obtain the
cytosolic fraction.
Western blotting
Nuclear and cytosolic pellets (~50 g) were boiled in
PBS (pH 7.4), diluted in Laemmli buffer with
-mercaptoethanol, separated on 10% Sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels for 1 h at 120V in
Tris-glycine SDS and transferred to a polyvinylidene dif-
luoride (PVDF) membrane. Blots were blocked with 5%
Bio-Rad Dry Milk (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and
Tris buffered saline (TBS) with Tween and probed over-
night at 4°C with primary antibodies against the follow-
ing: rat AGT (internal sequence of AGT (Int-AGT),
residues 42­57, 1:1000), Ang I sequence of AGT
(AI-AGT, residues 25­34, 1:1000) and renin (Inagami
antibody no. 826, 1:5000). Membranes were treated with
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled polyclonal anti
rabbit secondary antibodies (1:5000) for 1 h and detected
with chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce Biotechnology,
Rockford, Illinois, USA). Membranes were probed with
mouse monoclonal anti--actin (Sigma, St. Louis,
Missouri, USA, 1:5000) antibody as a loading control
and bands were quantified using MCID densitometry
software (InterFocus Imaging, Linton, UK).
Immunofluorescent microscopy
NRK-52E cells were grown in eight chamber slides for
two days in DMEM/F12 5% FBS which was replaced with
serum free media for one day. Cells were washed with PBS
and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Following
a PBS rinse, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton
and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
(Sigma A-8022). The fixed cells were probed with primary
antibodies for AGT and renin previously described for
western blot analysis. Cells were also probed with affinity
purified antibodies to Ang II (Phoenix Pharmaceutical,
Burlingame, California,USA) and Ang-(1-7) (custom anti-
body), PRR (Abcam ab64957, Cambridge, UK)) antibod-
ies. Antibodies were diluted in 3% normal donkey serum
as follows: Int-AGT (1:100), AI-AGT (1:100), renin
(1:500), PRR (1:500), Ang II (1:500) Ang-(1-7) (1:25),
calnexin (1:100). After overnight incubation with the pri-
mary antibody at 4°C, cells were rinsed with PBS, incu-
bated with fluorescent anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488
secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California,
USA), and the slides mounted with Molecular Probes
ProLong mounting media with 4',6-diamidino-2-phe-
nylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen) to stain the nuclei.

Peptide assays
Cell nuclei were isolated as described above and stored at
-80°C. The nuclear pellet was reconstituted in MilliQ
water and placed in a boiling water bath for 15 min. The
nuclear fraction was acidified with trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) to a final concentration of 0.2%, sonicated and cen-
trifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The resultant super-
natant was applied to an activated Sep-Pak C18 extraction
column, washed with 0.2% TFA, and the peptide fraction
eluted with 3 ml of 80% methanol in 0.2% TFA.
Measurement of immunoreactive Ang II and Ang-(1-7) in
the extracted nuclei was performed using two distinct radi-
oimmunoassays (RIAs).24 The Ang-(1-7) RIA fully recog-
nizes Ang-(1-7) and Ang-(2-7), but cross-reacts less than
0.01% with Ang-(3­7), Ang II, Ang I, and their fragments.
The Ang II RIA equally recognizes Ang III, Ang-(3-8), and
Ang-(4-8), but cross-reacts less than 0.01% with Ang I and
Ang-(1-7). The limit of detection was 4 fmol/ tube for
Ang-(1-7) and 0.5 fmol/ tube for Ang II.
Renin assay
The cell nuclei were isolated as described above and stored
at -80°C. The nuclear pellet was reconstituted in 2 ml of 25
mM HEPES, 125 mM NaCl at pH 7.4 and left for 60 min
on ice. A sample from the lysate was taken for protein con-
tent. For basal renin activity assay, 0.4 ml of nuclear lysate
was added to 0.2 ml of nephrectomized rat plasma (NRP)
as the source of exogenous AGT substrate. The following
protease inhibitors were added to prevent the metabolism
of Ang I: amastatin (AM; 2 M), bestatin (BS; 10 M),
chymostatin (CHYM; 10 M), benzyl succinate (BSC; 10
M), para-chloromercuribenzoic acid (PCMB; 0.5 mM)
and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (2.5 mM) (all
at final concentrations). The assay was performed at 37ºC
for 90 min alone or with the renin inhibitor aliskiren (1 M,
final concentration).24 Activation of prorenin was per-
formed by addition of 0.1 mg trypsin (Sigma) to the nuclear
sample with the peptidase inhibitors for 60 min on ice.24
Trypsin was inactivated by incubation with an excess of
soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI; 1 mg/ml, Sigma) for 15
min at room temperature. SBTI is a potent serine protease
inhibitor that does not attenuate renin, an aspartyl protease.
Following SBTI, the renin assay was performed as
described above. All renin and prorenin samples were
extracted on Sep-Pak C18 columns prior to the assessment
of Ang I by RIA as described.24 Blank values for the assay
(aliskerin with and without lysates) were subtracted from
the sample values; renin activity was expressed as nmol
Ang I generated per h per mg protein.
AGT assay for renin
A rat kidney cortical homogenate as a source for renin was
added to a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma) (1/100)
and SBTI (1 mg) in the presence or absence of aliskiren
(10 M) in a final volume of 1 ml buffer (10 mM HEPES,
125 mM NaCl, 10 M ZnCl2
, pH 7.4). NRP as the source
of intact AGT was then added and incubated at 37°C for 60
min. Aliquots were removed at 5, 15, 30 and 60 min and
analyzed by western blot using the AI-AGT antibody. The
membrane was then stripped and probed with the second
AGT antibody, Int-AGT.
Peptide metabolism
To characterize the processing of the peptides in vitro,
125I-Ang-I or Ang II (0.5 nM) were incubated with the sol-
ubilized nuclear fractions as previously described.25
Metabolism assays were conducted at 37°C in 10 mM
HEPES, 125 mM NaCl, 10 M ZnCl2
, pH 7.4, with 2-3 g
protein of the nuclear fraction in a final volume of 0.5 ml
with or without the indicated inhibitors. The reaction was
stopped by addition of ice-cold 1.0% phosphoric acid, cen-
trifuged at 16,000 g, and the supernatants stored at -20°C.
Samples were separated by reverse-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the 125I-products were
detected by a flow-through  detector.25 Products were
identified by comparison of their retention times to
125I-angiotensin standards. Peptides were iodinated by the
chloramine T method and purified by HPLC (specific
activity > 2000 Ci/mmol). The aminopeptidase inhibitors
amastatin AM (2 M) and BS (10 M) were included in
the basal assay conditions. We subsequently used the fol-
lowing inhibitors to block thiol peptidases (PCMB; 0.5
mM); neprilysin (SCH39370 or SCH, 10 M), prolyl oli-
gopeptidase (Z-prolyl prolinal or ZPP, 50 M) and thimet
oligopeptidase (c-phenylpropyl-alanine-alanine-phenyla-
lanine-p-aminobenzoate or CPP, 50 M). Enzyme activi-
ties were expressed as fmol product per mg protein per
min (fmol/mg/min).
Statistical analysis
All measurements are expressed as mean±standard error
(SEM). Differences between the groups were analyzed by
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Newman-
Keuls multiple comparison analysis. All figures were con-
structed with GraphPad Prism V plotting and statistical
software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California,
USA). A probability value of <0.05 was required for statis-
tical significance.
Results
AGT antibodies
The present study utilized antibodies raised against two
different epitopes of the AGT protein. The AI-AGT anti-
body recognized the N terminus or Ang I sequence of rat
AGT while the Int-AGT antibody was directed against an
1138 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
internal sequence distal to Ang I.21 We characterized both
antibodies by protein immunoblots using 0.5­5.0 µl of
either NRP as a source of intact AGT or commercial FBS
in which the NRK-E52 cells were routinely maintained
(Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1(a), the AI-AGT anti-
body recognized two protein bands of approximately 60
and 55 kDa from the NRP, as well as two similar sized
bands in the FBS. The NRP samples were then exposed to
renin from a rat cortical homogenate at 37°C or 4°C with
or without the renin inhibitor aliskiren and the immunob-
lot probed with the AI-AGT antibody. In the absence of
aliskiren, the AGT band was reduced at 15 min and
essentially abolished by 30 min at 37°C (Figure 1(b)).
Addition of aliskiren or incubation at 4°C prevented the
disappearance of the protein up to 60 min. In contrast, the
Int-AGT antibody clearly recognized AGT in the NRP
samples (Figure 1(c), 0.5­5.0 µl serum), but did not
detect AGT in FBS (Figure 1(c)). The Int-AGT antibody
appeared to exhibit greater sensitivity to rat AGT; the
antibody detected 0.5 µl of NRP while the AI-AGT anti-
body required a sample volume two- to five-fold higher
(lane 4, Figure 1(c) versus 1(a)). Moreover, re-probing
the immunoblot from Figure 1(b) with the Int-AGT anti-
body revealed the AGT bands in the samples incubated
with renin (Figure 1(d)). These data confirm that the Int-
AGT antibody recognized residues distal to the Ang I
sequence of AGT in rat plasma, but not FBS, and that the
AI-AGT antibody does not detect the renin-processed or
des-Ang I form of rat AGT (and likely FBS). Utilizing
the two AGT antibodies, we assessed expression of the
protein by immunofluorescent (IMF) staining and protein
immunoblots of isolated nuclear and cytosolic fractions
of the NRK-52E cells (Figure 2). As shown in Figure 2(a)
and 2(b), IMF staining with the AI-AGT antibody
revealed primarily cytosolic staining of the protein that
was apparently exclusive of the nucleus. Moreover, the
immunoblot showed a 55 kDa band in the cytosolic frac-
tion (lanes 4­6), but no immunoreactive band in the
nuclear fraction of the NRK-52E cells (lanes 1­3, Figure
2(c)). In contrast, IMF staining with the Int-AGT anti-
body revealed the predominant localization of AGT to
the area of the cell nucleus (Figure 2(d) and 2(e)). The

immunoblot with the Int-AGT antibody also revealed a
prominent protein band (55 kDa) in the nuclear fraction
(lanes 1­3), as well as a faint band in the cytosol (lanes
4­6, Figure 2(f)).
Renin and PRR
The apparent absence of intact AGT in the nucleus sug-
gested that renin or a renin-like enzyme cleaved AGT
either within the nucleus or outside the organelle with
subsequent nuclear transport of the precursor. As shown
in Figure 3(a), IMF staining for renin revealed the pre-
dominant nuclear localization of the enzyme in the cells.
Protein immunoblots of the nuclear and cytosolic frac-
tions also revealed a predominant immunoreactive band
at ~ 55 kDa in the nuclear fraction and a faint band in the
cytosol (Figure 3(b)). We next assessed renin activity in
isolated nuclei of the NRK-52E cells by addition of exog-
enous NRP AGT in the absence or presence of aliskiren.
Renin activity averaged 0.77±0.05 nmol Ang I/mg/h and

1140 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
aliskiren reduced activity by 83% (Figure 3(c)). To deter-
mine the prorenin levels, nuclear extracts were pretreated
with trypsin to convert prorenin to renin and the genera-
tion of Ang I from NRP AGT was determined in the pres-
ence of the trypsin inhibitor SBTI. Trypsin activation of
nuclear prorenin significantly increased enzyme activity
approximately three-fold to 1.93±0.23 nmol Ang I/mg
protein/h and aliskiren inhibited 93% of theAng I-forming
activity (Figure 3(c)). These findings suggest the presence
of both renin and prorenin in the NRK-52E cell nuclei.
Since prorenin may preferentially bind to the prorenin
receptor to increase catalytic activity and/or induce cell
signaling, we stained the cells with an antibody against
the prorenin receptor. As shown in Figure 3(d), IMF stain-
ing revealed primarily perinuclear staining of the PRR in
cells counter-stained with the nuclear marker DAPI shown

in blue. In comparison, cells were also stained with an
antibody to calnexin, a protein intrinsic to the perinuclear/
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and the DAPI
marker (Figure 3(e)).
Ang peptides
The expression of both AGT and renin within the NRK-
52E cell nuclei may suggest a pathway for the intracellular
synthesis of Ang peptides. Therefore, we assessed the cell
staining and content of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) by two dis-
tinct antibodies specific to the C-terminus of each peptide.
As shown in Figures 4(a) and 4(b), the affinity-purified
antibodies toAng II andAng-(1-7) revealed predominantly
nuclear staining. Consistent with this pattern of staining,
nuclear extracts from four different cell passages con-
tained 59±2 fmol/mg protein of Ang II and 57±22 fmol/mg
protein of Ang-(1-7) (Figure 4(c)). We then examined the
potential processing enzymes that may contribute to Ang
II or Ang-(1-7) within the nucleus. Solubilized nuclear
fractions were incubated with 125I-Ang I or 125I-Ang II for
15­120 min at 37C and the products were analyzed by a
HPLC-coupled -detector.25 As shown in the chromato-
graphic panels of Figure 5, Ang-(1-7) was the major peak

neprilysin inhibitor SCH39370 (SCH; 10 M) or prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor z-prolyl-prolinal (ZPP; 50 M) did not inhibit Ang-(1-
7) generation (shown in (c) and (d), respectively). The thimet oligopeptidase inhibitor (CPP; 50 M) and the thiol inhibitor (PCMB;
500 M) essentially abolished Ang-(1-7) production (shown in (e) and (f), respectively). A minor peak of Ang-(1-4) was detected in
panels (b)­(f).

of Ang I metabolism at 15 and 60 min (Figure 5(a) and
5(b), respectively). Ang I exhibited a half-life of 73 min in
the nuclear cell extracts and Ang-(1-7) was the primary
product over the 120 min time course (Figure 6). In con-
trast, there was minimal metabolism of the Ang II in the
nuclear extracts with >70% of the peptide intact at 120 min
(data not shown).
There are several endopeptidases including neprilysin,
prolyl oligopeptidase and thimet oligopeptidase that
directly process Ang I to Ang-(1-7).26 The neprilysin
agent SCH39370 and the prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor
ZPP did not block the generation of Ang-(1-7) in the
nuclear extract (Figure 5(c) and 5(d), respectively). Both
the thimet oligopeptidase inhibitor CPP and the thiol pro-
tease inhibitor PCMB markedly reduced the peak of Ang-
(1-7) and preserved the peak of Ang I (Figure 5(e) and
5(f), respectively). Evaluation of these inhibitors at the 60
min incubation period revealed that CPP and PCMB
inhibited Ang-(1-7) formation by over 80% and suggests
that thimet oligopeptidase converts Ang I to Ang-(1-7) in
isolated nuclei (Figure 7). We next assessed the Ang-(1-7)
and Ang-(1-4)-forming activities at 120 min in the pres-
ence of CPP and SCH39370. Again, thimet oligopeptidase
accounted for the majority of Ang-(1-7) at this time
(Figure 8); however, there remained small peaks of Ang-
(1-7) and Ang-(1-4) with CPP (Figure 8(b)). Addition of
SCH39370 to CPP appeared to further reduce both Ang-
(1-7) and Ang-(1-4) (Figure 8(c)), but the response did not
reach statistical significance (Figure 8(d)).
Discussion
In the present study we characterized the RAS in the NRK-
52E epithelial cell line to facilitate our understanding of
this intracellular system. The NRK-52E cells are widely
utilized to examine the functional aspects of the Ang
II-AT1
receptor pathway, as well as the counter-regulatory
actions of the Ang-(1-7)-AT7
/Mas axis.27­32 The current
findings revealed that NRK-52E cells express multiple
components of an intracellular RAS and parallel our previ-
ous findings in the isolated tubules of the sheep kidney.9 In
this case, both immunofluorescent staining and western
blots demonstrated that NRK-52E cells express AGT,
prorenin, PRR and the peptides Ang II and Ang-(1-7) in
the nuclear or perinuclear compartments. Activity studies
revealed renin-dependent conversion to Ang I; however,
prorenin was the more abundant form of the enzyme in a
3:1 ratio in the nuclear fraction. Finally, we demonstrate
endopeptidase activity in the nuclear fraction that converts
Ang I directly to Ang-(1-7) without the prerequisite forma-
tion of Ang II. The identity of the nuclear endopeptidase is
likely thimet oligopeptidase based on the sensitivity to
both the selective inhibitor CPP and the thiol agent PCMB.
Utilizing two different antibodies to rat AGT, we primar-
ily detected the processed form of AGT (des-Ang I Aogen)
in the nucleus. Sherrod et al. detected AGT primarily in the
nucleus of human astrocytes and identified a nuclear locali-
zation signal in the C-terminal portion of the protein; how-
ever, these studies did not determine whether the precursor

was processed or intact.7 In the current study, the presence
of the cleaved AGT in the nucleus suggests proteolytic pro-
cessing potentially by renin which may contribute to local
levels of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) detected in the nuclear frac-
tion. Indeed, this may constitute a pathway for the genera-
tion and delivery of peptide ligands to nuclearAng receptors
evident in the tubule epithelium, as well as in other tissues.
Alternatively,AGT may be processed outside of the nucleus
and the des-Ang I form subsequently transported to the
nucleus. Apart from its role as the precursor to Ang II or
Ang-(1-7), nuclear AGT may potentially contribute to cell
signaling and function. Moreover, two studies reveal that
both intact and the Ang I-cleaved forms of AGT attenuated
angiogenesis.33,34 In this regard, Pan et al. reported high affin-
ity binding sites forAGT that internalized following binding
in primary cultures of human proximal tubules.35 In contrast
to the nuclear localization of des-Ang I AGT, the Ang
I-directed antibody revealed the protein in both the cytosolic
compartment of the NRK-52E cells, as well as in FBS. The
circulating RAS is upregulated during pregnancy and the
presence of AGT in FBS is not surprising. Since the Int-
AGT antibody failed to recognize FBS AGT or detect AGT
to the same extent as the AI-AGT antibody in the cell cyto-
sol, it is possible that cytosolicAGT may primarily originate
from uptake of AGT in the cell media. Recent studies have
questioned the prevailing tenet that tubular AGT solely
reflects local synthesis of the protein.36,37 Indeed, the protein
transporter megalin may mediate the cellular uptake and sta-
ble sequestration of AGT within a subset of renal proximal
tubules.37 However, it is not clear as to the cellular fate of
AGT taken up from the tubular fluid and whether this path-
way contributes to the generation ofAng peptides. Based on

the present findings, the intact form of AGT in the NRK-
52E cytosol may localize to a subcellular compartment sep-
arate from rat renin. Alternatively, provided the cytosolic
form of AGT arises primarily from FBS, the presence of
intact AGT may reflect inefficient processing by rat renin
due to species differences in the recognition of AGT by
renin. Clearly, additional studies are required to elucidate
whether the cytosolic from of AGT in the NRK-52E cells
reflects the uptake of FBS AGT and the extent that megalin
contributes to this process.
The present characterization of the RAS in the NRK-
52E cells arose from the demonstration of nuclear renin
and AGT in isolated sheep proximal tubules, as well as the
expression of Ang receptors on isolated nuclei.9 The local-
ization of renin to the non-juxtaglomerular (JG) compart-
ments of the kidney is somewhat controversial. Rohrwasser
and colleagues originally demonstrated renin in the princi-
pal cells of the collecting duct in both the mouse and rat
kidney.38,39 Subsequent studies suggest that renin regula-
tion in the collecting duct of the rat kidney differs from
that of JG-derived renin.40,41 Immunoreactive renin and
mRNA expression were also reported in the proximal
tubules; however, the intracellular localization of the pro-
tease was not determined.42­44 In this regard, an intracel-
lular or truncated form of renin was identified in the
mitochondria which may contribute to local Ang II genera-
tion.45­47 The isolated nuclei of the NRK-52E cells con-
tained both active renin and prorenin that converted
exogenous AGT to Ang I; this activity was essentially
abolished by the renin inhibitor aliskerin. IMF staining
also revealed that the prorenin receptor localized to the
perinuclear compartment of the NRK-52E cells which is
consistent with the findings of Schefe and colleagues.15
Apart from contributing to activation of the enzyme, the
receptor may bind prorenin to stimulate cellular pathways
including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase
and transforming growth factor beta TGF- release that are
not dependent on the Ang II-AT1
receptor axis.13,14,48,49 The
extent that renin or activated prorenin contributes to the
intracellular formation of Ang II or Ang-(1-7) in the NRK-
52E cells awaits further study. Furthermore, studies are
necessary to elucidate whether the PRR contributes to
functional signaling pathways in these cells through an
interaction with intracellular prorenin.
In addition to AGT and renin, both immunoreactive
Ang II and Ang-(1-7) were identified in the isolated
nuclear fractions of the NRK-52E cells. Camargo de
Andrade et al initially reported IMF staining for both Ang
II and Ang-(1-7) in the nucleus of isolated mesangial
cells.10 Consistent with presence ofAng-(1-7) in the nuclei,
we find an endopeptidase-like activity that processed Ang
I predominantly to Ang-(1-7). The inhibitor profile sug-
gested that the nuclear peptidase is likely thimet oligo-
peptidase (EC 3.4.24.15). Inhibitors selective for other
endopeptidases that form Ang-(1-7) including neprilysin
(EC 3.4.24.11) and prolyl-oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26)
did not significantly reduce the conversion of Ang I to
Ang-(1-7). Thimet oligopeptidase is a zinc-dependent
member of the metallopeptidase M3 family, but is sensi-
tive to thiol or cysteine inhibitors such as PCMB and the
selective inhibitor CPP.50­52 Interestingly, thimet oligo-
peptidase was localized to the nucleus of neurons in the rat
brain by immunocytochemical staining.53,54 In this regard,
Thompson et al. identified the nuclear localization signal
sequence for human thimet oligopeptidase.55 Moreover,
the overexpression of intracellular thimet oligopeptidase
in human embryonic cells (HEK) cells attenuated Ang
II-AT1
receptor signaling as well as the actions of other G
protein-coupled receptors.56,57 Blockade of Ang-(1-7) for-
mation from Ang I did not result in the generation of Ang
II in the nuclear fraction nor did we find extensive metabo-
lism ofAng II toAng-(1-7) or any other products.Although
these findings suggest that Ang II is stable in the nuclear
fraction, they do not identify the pathway for the nuclear
formation or sequestration of Ang II and we can only sug-
gest several possibilities for the nuclear expression of Ang
II at this time. The peptide may arise from the direct pro-
cessing of AGT through a non-renin mechanism or an
intermediate peptide substrate such as Ang-(1-12).2,26
Alternatively, nuclear Ang II may reflect the trafficking of
the Ang II-AT1
receptor complex from the plasma mem-
brane to the nucleus.58­62 Finally, Gonzalez-Villalobos et
al. report that uptake of both Ang II and Ang-(1-7) was
facilitated by the protein transporter megalin in the opos-
sum kidney (OK) epithelial cell line, an accepted cell
model for megalin-dependent uptake of albumin; however,
the intracellular fate of the internalized peptides was not
evaluated in these studies.63,64
In conclusion, the present study characterized the NRK-
52E epithelial cell line as a tubule model for the expression
of the intracellular RAS components within the kidney.
The kidney is one of the primary targets to specifically
block the ACE-Ang II-AT1
receptor axis by various thera-
peutic approaches including ACE inhibition, AT1
receptor
antagonism, and more recently, renin blockade to attenuate
blood pressure and renal injury. However, these regimens
may not completely prevent the pathological consequences
of an activated RAS. This may result from either insuffi-
cient drug doses to effectively block the intracellular RAS,
low lipophilicity of certain agents that leads to inadequate
intracellular concentrations, or an inability to inhibit
downstream signaling pathways independent of Ang II
generation.65 Indeed, increasing the dose of candesartan to
a level higher than the maximal recommended dose for
heart failure and hypertension significantly reduced persis-
tent proteinuria without a further decline in blood pres-
sure.66 Renin inhibitors such as aliskiren do not block the
binding of prorenin to the receptor.67 Therefore, the proin-
flammatory and profibrotic responses of an activated RAS
may not be completely attenuated by renin inhibitors that
would effectively reduce blood pressure. In this regard,
introducing membrane permeable nonpeptide agonists for
1146 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
the AT7
and AT2
receptors along with renin inhibition and
ARBs may overcome the loss of either AT7
or AT2

activation by renin inhibitors, as well as achieve maximal
blockade of the deleterious effects of the AngII-AT1
recep-
tor axis.
