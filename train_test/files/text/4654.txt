Introduction
This study is part of a larger project called Women's Voices
in a Shifting Global Health Landscape. This specific study
was motivated by the combined scientific and journalistic
curiosity to hear the "voices" of women around the world on
timely and urgent matters in which they play central roles.
The effect of migration on women's lives in general is one
of these concerns. The purpose of the present study is to
develop a preliminary and overall understanding of the topic
in the Japanese context as the country is facing simultane-
ously major demographic challenges such as becoming a
super-aged society and facing the lowest fertility rate in the
world. It implies multiple societal, health, and economic
consequences (Münz, 2008).
Women's Employment in Japan
The female full-employment rate in Japan is very low com-
pared with other OECD (Organisation for Economic
Co-Operation and Development) countries (OECD iLibrary,
2013). This low female employment rate includes career and
noncareer track employment (OECD iLibrary, 2013).
Furthermore, during the past two decades, the Japanese
economy has experienced deflation (http://web-japan.org/
factsheets/en/pdf/e04_economy.pdf). Urgent questions are
being raised in Japan regarding the low ratio of women in
full-time employment within the total workforce. A substan-
tial increase in the full-time employment of women in remu-
nerated activities would entail more taxable incomes
necessary to face the financial need of a super-aged society
(Elborgh-Woytek et al., 2013). In fact, the government is
considering reducing and even abolishing the spousal tax
benefit implemented in 1961 (Kodera, 2014). With the pres-
ent tax system, the head of the household, usually the hus-
band, can obtain a spousal income tax deduction if their wife
earns less than ¥1.41 million a year. In addition, the wife is
not required to pay a premium to become eligible for the
national pension plan if she earns less than ¥1.3 million a
year (Miyamoto, 2016). As a result, many women are not
encouraged to seek full-time employment. Boosting female
employment implies also inspiring women to develop
careers, become executives, and find themselves in leader-
ship roles. To facilitate this development, Prime Minister
Abe even promotes eradication of waiting lists for day care
centers by the end of 2017, employment of at least one
woman to an executive position in listed companies as well

Immigration, Women, and Japan--A Leap
Ahead and a Step Behind: A Qualitative
Journalistic Approach
Stéphanie Paillard-Borg1 and Jessica Holmgren1
Abstract
Japan has become a super-aged society, facing demographic challenges resulting in societal and economic consequences. In
its political structural reform, the Japanese government presented the urgency to consider the increase in labor mobility
that includes the issues of immigration and female employment, both domestic and foreign. The aim of this study was to
explore, from a Japanese woman's perspective, the intertwined issues of immigration. An in-depth interview was performed
and analyzed by content analysis with a methodological departure in qualitative journalistic interviewing. The case was a
Japanese woman with a unique profile. The results of this study, family permanency and group cohesiveness, can contribute
to understand the potential interdependency between the roles, within the Japanese society, of foreign female domestic
workers and Japanese women. In conclusion, it appears that the pivotal role of women in the Japanese society and the global
feminization of migration challenge Japanese social consistency.

as the option for women to get their old job back after mater-
nity leave (Kodera, 2014). Christine Lagarde, director of the
International Monetary Fund, supports this approach and
believes that women can "save" Japan through joining
career-track jobs that would boost economic growth
(Kingston, 2013). Some would argue that women already are
taking on the task as they care for all sorts of responsibilities
ranging from "being mothers, wives and caregivers for
elderly relatives to employees, volunteers and household
finance ministers" (Kingston, 2013).
Increased women's employment rate as well as a more
liberal immigration law, facilitating the entry in the country
of foreign domestic workers (http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/
Childdomesticlabour/lang­en/index.htm), has been dis-
cussed at the highest level of the Japanese government
("Japanese Women and Work," 2014). In fact, Prime Minister
Abe highlighted in his political structural reform the urgency
of increasing labor mobility. This reform combines the revi-
sion of the Japanese traditionally restrictive immigration law
and low female employment. Its objective is to raise the
country's gross domestic product (GDP), but these two main
issues are still very sensitive (Sanda, 2014). "We would like
to proactively consider how to use foreign domestic workers
from the perspective of women's empowerment and eco-
nomic growth" stated Prime Minister Abe in April 2014
("Government's Foreign Home Helper," 2015). This politi-
cal, economic, and immigration strategy is a way to tackle
the consequences of a super-aged society. It is proposed that
foreign domestic workers could potentially ease strains on
Japanese families, in particular help Japanese women with
the burden of domestic responsibilities, child, and elderly
care (Straubhaar, 2000; Yamanaka, 2008). This solution
would therefore boost their chance of career development
(Itoh, 2014; "Japanese Women and Work," 2014).
Immigration to Japan
Until now, the Japanese government had insisted in principle
that it would not accept unskilled workers as it did not want to
maintain foreign workers into problematic working conditions
and as such, foreigners could not, as a rule, obtain a long-term
visa as domestic workers. The exceptions were for those
employed by diplomats, non-Japanese nationals with a high
income, or those married to a Japanese citizen or with another
preexisting residency qualification ("Government's Foreign
Home Helper," 2015). In Japan, domestic workers are mostly
immigrant women from Southeast Asia. The strict immigra-
tion policy, described above, has made it historically difficult
for these women to immigrate to Japan. Time-limited working
visas have been delivered traditionally to women "entertain-
ers" or job training assimilated to low-paid jobs (Roberts,
2008). The outlook of gaining a long-term legal status in Japan
as an unskilled worker is low. In addition, the prospect of
acquiring employment in a Japanese household is socioeco-
nomically difficult for several reasons. First, domestic work is
not widely socially accepted in Japan compared with other
Asian countries. Even household help by Japanese to Japanese
is not common, as many Japanese perceive that working as a
domestic worker is somewhat shameful, but also hiring help to
care for loved ones can be perceived as dishonorable (Sanda,
2014). Second, the language barrier can also be, in some cases,
an important issue for these unskilled workers. Third, it is
costly for a middle-class Japanese family to hire a domestic
worker (Sanda, 2014). According to a survey by the Nomura
Research Institute (NRI), the main reasons for not hiring
domestic workers was the cost and the reluctance to bring a
stranger into the home ("Government's Foreign Home
Helper," 2015).
Legitimate concerns from human rights defense groups
are raised in regard to the legal status, working conditions,
and rights of those foreign women domestic workers
(Llewelyn & Hirano, 2009; "Overwork Cited in Deaths of
Record 34 Foreign Trainees," 2009). Increase in human traf-
ficking, as Japan has been on United Nations Watch list, is
one of the many dangers for these women (Noguchi, 2006).
A more generous immigration policy might mitigate the
problem as long as the laws are clear and in accordance to
international labor law protection for foreign workers and
human rights. By not having a well-defined and stringent
protection law, the risk of creating abuse of all kinds is highly
probable (Noguchi, 2006). From a Japanese perspective, a
reasonable degree of apprehension regarding immigration is
present and is associated with worsening of public security
associated to criminality, "social costs" related to education,
reduced wages connected to competition ("EDITORIAL,"
2016). The potential increase in labor mobility encouraging
the employment of foreign domestic workers could be per-
ceived as a threat toward the employment of unskilled
Japanese workers who have already very low wages
("Government's Foreign Home Helper," 2015; Sugimoto,
2010). Nevertheless, the demand for such workers will prob-
ably keep increasing due to the rapid growth of the elderly
population and its needs. This situation is under serious scru-
tiny by the Abe's government and needs an urgent sustain-
able approach. That is why the present government sees the
immigration to the country and employment of foreign
domestic workers as a mean to anticipate and respond to the
urgent demand within elderly care. In the near future, the
demand will probably be higher than the supply (Kato &
Miyamoto, 2015).Already, an increasing number of Japanese
people, most often women but also men, had to quit their job
and start caring for elderly relatives (Sanda, 2014).
Furthermore and in accordance with the widespread con-
cerns regarding immigration, not only unskilled but also
skilled workers such as nurses, usually from Southeast Asia,
are often refused the right to immigrate to Japan due to
political pressure by the Japanese labor unions (Sanda,
2014). Indeed, the government imposes a difficult and chal-
lenging examination for foreign nurses, which, among other
difficulties, requires high Japanese language competency
Paillard-Borg and Holmgren 3
("Issues Relating to Foreign Workers in Japan," 2004). With
increased immigration, Japan would be expected to move
from a homogenous and exclusionist society to a heteroge-
neous and inclusive one which would shake the whole social
organization, fear widely exploited historically by conserva-
tive political groups (Komai, 1995). Of significance,
Japanese women seem to be more in favor toward immigra-
tion in general than men as well as Generation Y more in
favor than Generation X and previous generations (Llewelyn
& Hirano, 2009).
Economists and social scientists see the issues of female
employment, immigration, and demographic changes as
interconnected, influencing one another, and being poten-
tially linked to solutions for a more sustainable future.
However, very little is known about the thoughts of Japanese
women and their own desire to join the workforce and accept
foreign domestic help to care for their children and elderly
family members. Indeed, to our knowledge no study has
been combining, through an in-depth interview, the explora-
tion of the following two intertwined factors: the boost in
Japanese female employment and the increase in immigrant
female domestic workers to Japan. The context of this study
is a Japanese megapolis with a focus on the work distribution
between low-skilled immigrant women compared with their
potentially higher skilled Japanese counterparts.
Aim
The aim of this study was to explore, from the perspective of
a Japanese woman, the intertwined issues of female immi-
gration to Japan and the need for foreign domestic workers,
and Japanese women's employment as the country is facing
major demographic and societal changes.
Method
To fulfill the aim, a case study with an in-depth interview
was performed and analyzed by content analysis with a
methodological departure in journalistic interviewing. Under
this particular type of interview, the research questions­
issues are expected to be refined continuously as new and
previously unexpected aspects of the phenomenon come to
light, a process that Partlett and Hamilton (1976) called pro-
gressive focusing. Indeed, the qualitative research in journal-
ism allows to start out the investigation of a given topic with
a preliminary idea, and then to reveal more significant issues
than originally thought (Hartin Iorio, 2004). The product of
this type of interview permits then the qualitative case study
research to capture the complexity of a phenomenon within
its real-life context (Paillard-Borg & Strömberg, 2014). A
case study is suitable when the case represents something
unique worth documenting and analyzing (Yin, 2003).
The study had for starting point the major global demo-
graphic transition that is currently taking place in the world
characterized by an aging of the population and a dropping
fertility rate. Japan was chosen for its front line position in
this demographic change accompanied by a strict immigra-
tion policy and a low women participation in the labor force.
The Case
A 48-year-old Japanese woman, called Yuka for the purpose
of this study, was interviewed. She was divorced and mother
of an 11-year-old child. She owned a successful business
with an international profile in the center of Tokyo. She
spoke good English and had studied and lived in the United
States for many years. She lived in a house near her office
with her child and a female Filipino domestic worker.
Yuka answered very early during the interview that she
considered herself as a single mother and benefited from the
help of a domestic worker as her parents and closest family
lived in another city, Osaka. Therefore, Yuka explained that
she did not have the option to receive the help of her parents
in taking care of her daughter. She also commented that the
choice of a Filipino domestic worker became a natural alter-
native as her Filipino family friend had recommended to her
some potential domestic workers when her daughter was
borne. It was then an option that she welcomed as she knew
that she wanted to continue her career. It had been asked to
Yuka if she had the knowledge of the employment of native
Japanese domestic workers by her friends and acquaintances.
She admitted that she did not know any such working
arrangement. She commented that she was aware only of the
employment of domestic workers from Southeast Asia.
The unique quality of the case was her distinctive and
unique profile of being exposed, due to her background and
work responsibilities, to both the Eastern and Western cul-
ture on a daily basis and therefore her ability to be critical
and have a global vision of the topic of interest. She had the
ability to "zoom in" the Japanese culture and at the same
time "zoom out" in order to share her global understanding
of the situation.
Data Collection
In January 2014, the main author was visiting Tokyo for the
purpose of scientific research and had the opportunity to meet
Yuka. The data were collected through an in-depth interview
after informed consent was obtained. The interview lasted
approximately 90 minutes in a private space at the workplace
of Yuka. It was recorded, transcribed verbatim, checked
against the original recording, and edited for accuracy. The
interview session began by asking Yuka to introduce herself
and describe her marital and familial status, her working situ-
ation, education, and living condition. Then, nonleading
questions were asked about her own experience and general
perception regarding economic-based migration to Japan,
more specifically the employment of female foreign domestic
workers as well as the role of Japanese women in the labor
force. Supplementary questions were asked with the purpose
4 SAGE Open
of clarifying some answers, such as "Can you give me exam-
ples?" "What do you mean?" "Interesting, please could you
develop?" "You are telling me that . . . is it right or would you
like to add something that I missed?" and so forth, that aimed
to cover various aspects of her own experience, perception,
and opinion about issues related to immigration and foreign
domestic work and women's employment.
Data Analysis
The data were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. The
data analysis is similarly reflexive and interactive as research-
ers continuously modify their treatment of data to accom-
modate new data and new insights about those data
(Sandelowski, 2000). Inspired of Sandelowski's (2000) qual-
itative description method, two themes and six subthemes
were identified (Table 1).
Ethical Considerations
The data collection and presentation of the findings are sub-
ject to the principles of international ethical standards for
conducting interviews with an informant capable of giving
informed consent to voluntarily participate in a study with a
descriptive design. Guidelines from Swedish Law (The
Swedish Code of Statutes, 2003) were followed. The rele-
vant ethical guidelines were applied such as autonomy,
integrity, and confidentiality of the informant and her sur-
roundings when describing the result in accordance with The
World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (The
World Medical Association, 2013).
Results
In this case study with a qualitative journalistic approach,
two main themes, family permanency and group cohesive-
ness, and six subthemes presented below were identified.
Family Permanency
Expectation. It was expressed several times by Yuka that mar-
ried women were expected primarily to be housewives. She
explained further that these women were sometimes employed
part-time in low-paid jobs but that full-time career-related
employment was not common when the children were small.
She also said that it was expected that men would work full-
time and support the family financially. According to Yuka,
those expectations were tacit and not openly discussed. She
added that the precarious national economy, as Japan had
been in recession for the last 20 years, had reinforced gender
stereotyping in term of familial responsibility
there is some interest for more homogeneity between genders,
predominantly coming from women, but for now people want to
feel safe and the home represents security for many people and
therefore we are expected to do what we are supposed to do"
Motherhood. Yuka repeatedly expressed that "being a mother"
and "acting as a mother" was central in the life of Japanese
women and it gave them a strong sense of identity. Two main
recurrent comments were made related to motherhood. The
first one was the increasing wish from women to work part-
time mostly for the purpose of getting a social network. The
second comment was the priority in their life of taking care of
their child or children. Yuka concluded that, according to her
observations and despite the "Japanese tradition," most inter-
national women she had met as well as Japanese women
expressed similar ambiguous and dual needs in regard to their
role as mothers. They wished to be available for their children
without stress when they were small but also wished to work
some hours outside the home. She disclosed that she was
aware that most women she socialized with had no particular
financial pressure and were privileged. However, she added
that in large cities like Tokyo, there was an increasing number
of young female professionals who enjoyed their profession
and wished for a career " . . . then if they also want children
and continue working, they have no choice and need to accept
the involvement of domestic workers . . . if their husband
agrees to it of course."
Privacy. The privacy and the intimacy of the family life were
described as central in Japan. According to Yuka, it was
uncommon for even wealthy Japanese families to have
domestic workers to take care of family members, and one of
the reasons was the risk to jeopardize family privacy " . . .
accepting somebody in your home and in your private life is
difficult. For mothers, it is very difficult as they are worried."
However, she added that when domestic help was recruited,
those relatively wealthy families privileged foreign domestic
employment mainly from Southeast Asia. One motive was
surprisingly the advantage of the language barrier. As the
Japanese language is difficult to master and understand for
foreigners, it offers more privacy to these families.
Group Cohesiveness
Economy. Anxiety and reflections in regard to "money" and
finances were common during the interview. Yuka explained
that domestic help was unaffordable for most Japanese

families and only willing wealthy families could afford it so
far. According to Yuka, it reflected a clear social­economic
dilemma. When asked about the issues of national economy
and immigration into the country, Yuka stated that she was
aware of the need for foreign skilled and unskilled workers
but that the nation, in general, was no ready or at least not
open to that possibility yet. She explained that it was largely
due to the recession that had been taking place for two
decades: " . . . people are worried about the economy, they
are aware of the world around Japan . . . but the world com-
ing to Japan and taking jobs and therefore increasing unem-
ployment is worrisome."
Fear.Yuka described multiple types of fears. One of them
was the fear of losing the Japanese traditions and values with
the arrival of immigrants to the country. The worry about
increased criminality was also a recurrent theme during the
interview as liberal immigration was synonym of criminality
and danger. It was expressed several times that the Japanese
people rationalized their fear of immigration based on the
perceived failure of the Western countries on the matter.
Pride.Pride was also an important theme during the inter-
view. Pride was expressed in term of the "higher sense of
morality in Japan compared to other countries"; she added
that she believed that Japanese treated foreigners well: " . . .
but in general in Japanese families, they treat foreign domes-
tic help quite ok. It is not like in some countries . . . we are
civilized . . . " According to Yuka, Japan was unique about
how well it treated its foreign workers and that she was proud
of it. Another sense of pride explained by Yuka was that Jap-
anese were "too proud to work as domestic workers." Yuka
explained that this strong sense of pride prevented Japanese,
even the unemployed ones sometimes to work as domestic
workers.
Discussion
The main findings of this study, family permanency and
group cohesiveness, can contribute to understand the com-
bined and controversial issues of immigration to Japan, most
often of female domestic workers and female Japanese
employment from the perspective of a Japanese woman. The
results, based on the interview of a woman with a unique
profile, reveal the complexity surrounding the role of women
living in a country facing a super-aged society and a major
societal mutation. The context of Japan is unique as it is an
island constantly under the threat of major natural disasters
causing thousands of deaths at a time and where national and
community identity is essential for its survival (Matthews,
2003). The complex motivations behind individual and
group actions in different cultural settings caused by natural
disasters are rarely analyzed and understood (Schlehe, 2008).
As any vulnerable group, the threat of the "outsider" is con-
stant. Criminality, violence, and perversity of the social
norms are the implicit and explicit fears linked to immigra-
tion and social changes (Mahmud, 2014; Shipper, 2005). The
vulnerability of Japan to its natural environment probably
reinforces its need for traditions and social consistency. The
pivotal role of women in societies and the global feminiza-
tion of migration emerge as the most important points based
on the main findings of this study, family permanency and
group cohesiveness.
The Pivotal Role of Women
An increasing number of Japanese women, especially in
urban settings, are questioning the lack of gender equality
and choosing a career path instead of building a family; how-
ever, in this "modern Confucian family," women's traditional
place in the society is still highly valued (Makita, 2010;
North, 2009). These conflicting and ambiguous expectations
from the women themselves and the society in general chal-
lenge family permanency and group cohesiveness. It appears
through this study that Japanese women find themselves
nowadays at a crossroad between the past and the future as
well as the Eastern and Western civilizations. As confirmed
by Yuka, women are still central in the Japanese social order
incarnating multiple roles ranging from "mother, wife,
household manager and caregiver to elderly relatives"
(Kingston, 2013; Rosenberger, 2007). Women appear to con-
sciously act as the guardians of the Japanese social consis-
tency (Butterfield, 2014), while the symbols of patriarchal
prestige continue to be very present (North, 2009). Traditions
colored by gender displays maintain the certainties of his-
torically contextualized gender identities and reproduced
gender inequality (North, 2009). However, the pivotal role of
women in informal care is present in many cultures. Women
are often the glue holding social relations together and play a
central role as friends, daughters, sisters, mothers, and grand-
mothers throughout all stages of the life course (Bracke,
Christiaens, & Wauterickx, 2008). Therefore, the role of the
female domestic workers caring for Japanese families could
also become a pivotal role allowing Japanese women to work
outside the home and still building a family and caring for
the elderly under the same roof.
The Global Feminization of Migration
This study has identified how the entangled issues of female
immigration and employment of Japanese women are closely
related to the importance of family permanency and group
cohesiveness in the Japanese society. Even though these
results cannot be generalized, it lifts the importance of these
challenges to a global level. Although the issues of immigra-
tion and the role of women in the society are relatively new
in Japan, it has been taking place for a long time in both the
developed and developing world. Globalization has acceler-
ated these issues and has made them even more complex
(Browne & Braun, 2008a). As a world community, we
6 SAGE Open
cannot only discuss the impact of societal changes at a
national level but need to pursue a global perspective.
Therefore, it is important to gain a better knowledge about
the increasing number of immigrant women coming to
developed nations to fulfill the workforce needs (Browne &
Braun, 2008b). At the same time, it is crucial to examine in
which way the migration of these immigrant women to Japan
or other high-income countries impact their community
cohesiveness and family permanency (Adanu & Johnson,
2009; Hofmann & Buckley, 2013; International Organization
for Migration, 2013). In addition to the impact of migration
on their own community and family, it is relevant to wonder
about the condition of these immigrant women in the host
country. Indeed, by empowering native women, Japanese
women in the context of this study, immigrant women risk
becoming "second-class citizens" as they are triply disad-
vantaged by race/ethnicity, their status as nonnationals, and
gender inequalities. These concerns are legitimately feared
by human rights organizations (Lee, 2005). The dynamic of
immigration and women's role are complex and need to be
considered as much as possible with a global perspective
without being fragmented. The feminization of migration
remains among the least understood trends in migration lit-
erature according to Hofmann and Buckley (2013). Most
often, the issues related to female migration are investigated
unilaterally through the situation of women migrants coming
to a host country. In this study, the feminization of migration
has a bilateral interest as it lifts the importance of the interac-
tion between the phenomenon of female migration and its
potential impact on the lives of native women in relation to
family permanency and group cohesiveness.
Conclusion
Japan has the uniqueness to be a leap ahead in term of its
demographic challenges as well as its highly developed soci-
ety, and simultaneously a step behind in regard to the weight
of ancestral traditions. The findings of this study show the
intertwined issues of female immigration and employment of
Japanese women. It appears that Japanese women find them-
selves nowadays at an intersection between the past and the
future as well as the East and the West. Furthermore, it
emerges that the pivotal role of women in the Japanese soci-
ety and the global feminization of migration has a bilateral
dynamic, in other words how the situation of some women
can impact other women in relation to family permanency
and group cohesiveness.
