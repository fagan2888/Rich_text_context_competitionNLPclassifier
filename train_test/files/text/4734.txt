Today our nation's schools are faced with the growing and
evolving pressures of increasing the academic achievement
of students. With the increasing pressures to improve educa-
tional programs, states have implemented standards and per-
formance assessments (high-stakes tests) to measure student
achievement, including increased graduation requirements.
High-stakes testing systems generate scores with important
consequences to schools and school personnel, which are
also applied to students in the form of graduation require-
ments or remedial courses (Austin & Mahlman, 2002).
The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation changed the
face of the standards movement and the measure of student
achievement. The purpose of the NCLB legislation was to
ensure that all students have an opportunity to obtain a high-
quality education and increase students' academic achieve-
ment (Gordon, Yocke, Maldonado, & Saddler, 2007). There
are growing concerns among career and technical education
(CTE) leaders based on the fact that no program area of CTE
(agriculture, business and computers, marketing, family and
consumer sciences, health occupations, or technology-trade
and industry education) is specifically mentioned in the NCLB
legislation, and there could be a significant impact on CTE
programs in the future (Martin, Fritzsche, & Ball, 2006).
CTE courses are an integral part of most comprehensive
high schools in Virginia; thus, if these courses are reduced,
many high school students will not have the opportunity
for a comprehensive high school experience or gain expo-
sure to specialized training and work skills. Elective courses
provide students with educational alternatives to reinforce
reading, mathematics, and science skills that are highly
valued in the state assessments. Students succeed in schools
due to a number of factors, and a sound CTE program is one
of them (Daggett, 2005).
Statement of the Problem
As CTE establishes and maintains itself as a viable compo-
nent of the comprehensive school program, there is a need to
determine how students who have completed a CTE concen-
tration of sequenced courses perform on the state-mandated
high-stakes Virginia standards of learning (SOL) tests. CTE
courses will continue to lose enrollment and be removed
from high school course offerings unless educational leaders
can clearly demonstrate how these programs (a) contribute
to the academic success of students as measured by state
academic tests and (b) serve as motivation for students to
stay in school and perform better in academic courses
(Daggett, 2009). All CTE courses in Virginia have been cor-
related to the core content area SOL; thus, the curriculum for
these courses covers some of the same content as the core
courses with a practical and contextual application. In 2000,
the Virginia Department of Education's (VDOE) Career and
Technical Education Department developed crosswalks
(correlations) to the SOLs in the four content areas. These

Career andTechnical Education:Academic
Achievement and Graduation Rates of
Students in the Commonwealth of Virginia
Eleanor Hearst Blowe1 andTed Price1
Abstract
The No Child Left Behind legislation was signed into law to ensure children in the United States receive quality education
and learn the skills needed to be successful. Career and technical education (CTE) is not mentioned in the legislation, which
suggests that more CTE courses may be dropped from high school master schedules, which makes the topic a concern for
educational leaders.The purpose of this study was to investigate the academic performance of CTE completers and non-CTE
completers in the Commonwealth of Virginia on the standards of learning English reading and mathematics assessments as
well as cohort graduation rates. Findings indicate that statistically (p < .05), CTE completers had higher mathematics and
Grade 11 English reading pass rates as well as higher cohort graduation rates than those of non-CTE completers.

correlations provide contextual connections between CTE
and the content areas. After development of the crosswalks,
VDOE made this information available on the state's CTE
state website with the student competency task for each of
the courses offered in Virginia (Virginia's CTE Resource
Center, 2009).
With the demands of accountability testing intensify-
ing, career and technical educators will face even
more pressure to devote time and energy preparing their
students for the high-stakes assessments, potentially
threatening time formally devoted to the attainment of
specific technical skills. (Thomas, 2004, pp. 26-27)
This brings attention to the potential need for the investiga-
tion of the impact of high-stakes testing on CTE instructional
time in Virginia.
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this study was to investigate the academic
performance of CTE completers and non-CTE completers
in the Commonwealth of Virginia on the SOL English
reading and mathematics assessments as well as cohort
graduation rates. Through an evaluation of CTE students'
performance on Virginia's SOL assessments in English read-
ing, mathematics, as well as graduation rates, educational
leaders would gain information about the performance
of CTE students as it relates to academic performance on
the state-mandated SOL tests. In this time of school
accountability, a study on the impact of CTE on academic
achievement in the Commonwealth of Virginia is due to be
investigated.
Significance of the Study
Researchers note that there is a scarcity of research on the
impact of high-stakes testing and NCLB on CTE (Gordon et
al., 2007). Federal legislation has regulated CTE since its
inception and continues to mandate the operation of the
programs. Thus, there is documentation available in reference
to the specifics of the Carl Perkins legislation and the
requirements of the grant that funds secondary and postsec-
ondary CTE programs. However, few state studies have
been conducted to evaluate the impact of the requirements
of federal-mandated testing of NCLB on CTE programs
(Gordon et al., 2007).
Literature Review
Even though CTE courses use contextual learning and
real-world application, the courses are typically offered as
electives, and because CTE is not mentioned in the NCLB
legislation, it may be difficult for policy makers, educators,
and teachers to see how CTE courses contribute to achieving
the goals of the legislation. Policy makers and educators
have generally acknowledged the value of the practical skills
taught in CTE courses, but they rarely receive the status or
importance attributed to academic skills and knowledge
learned in CTE courses. The literature acknowledges that
CTE provides students with practical occupational experi-
ences that help students to see the relevance of school, but
as the demands of NCLB continue to increase, educators are
making decisions to enforce more instructional time in core
content courses. The reviewed literature indicates that a
"narrowing curriculum" has evolved as a result of increased
accountability requirements (Amrein & Berliner, 2002;
Davis, 2006). As a result, CTE is in a position that it must
demonstrate its contribution to student achievement.
Based on the contextual approach used in CTE courses,
student achievement and learning are improved (Glenn, 2005).
In addition, there is an increased emphasis on incorporating
core academic skills into CTE. As a result of the Carl D.
Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 2006,
many states have closely aligned their CTE competencies
with state academic standards, which resulted in case study
results that demonstrate isolated successes. The literature
reviewed has yielded mixed results regarding the impact of
CTE on student achievement and graduation rates. Studies
reviewed indicate that CTE student achievement may not
surpass that of their non-CTE counterparts, but there has been
an increase in their academic performance and course-taking
patterns. Investigating the historical perspective of CTE
and how it has evolved to meet the needs and demands
of changing educational reforms, including the current legis-
lation of NCLB and high-stakes testing, is important to this
study. The literature indicates that there is a need for CTE to
continually demonstrate its contributions to the accountability
benchmarks set forth in NCLB to avoid narrowing the
curriculum.
Method
After reviewing the literature regarding narrowing the cur-
riculum and CTE student achievement, it was determined
that examining CTE student achievement and graduation
rates in Virginia was worthy of investigation. The purpose of
this study was to investigate the academic performance of
CTE completers and non-CTE completers in the
Commonwealth of Virginia on the SOL Grade 11 English
reading and mathematics assessments as well as cohort
graduation rates. Evaluation of SOL pass rates in English
reading and mathematics as well as graduation rates pro-
vided data regarding the performance of CTE completers as
compared with non-CTE completers. The research questions
that guided this study were as follows:
Research Question 1: What is the difference, if any,
between high school CTE enrollment status (CTE
completer vs. non-CTE completer) and student
Blowe and Price 3
achievement as measured by Grade 11 English
reading SOL pass rates?
Research Question 2: What is the difference, if any,
between high school CTE enrollment status (CTE
completer vs. non-CTE completer) and student
achievement as measured by SOL mathematics
pass rates of the highest level of mathematics com-
pleted (Algebra I, Algebra II, and/or Geometry)?
Research Question 3: What is the difference, if
any, between high school CTE enrollment status
(CTE completer vs. non-CTE completer) and the
graduation rates of students?
This study used a quantitative evaluation methodology to
determine the difference between CTE concentrators and
nonconcentrators with regard to academic achievement and
graduation rates of high school students. According to Miller
and Salkind (2002), evaluation research involves assessing
the strengths and weakness of a program to evaluate effec-
tiveness or merit. In this study, the "program" is CTE, and
the value or "merit" is the impact of CTE concentration on
student achievement. As indicated in the literature review,
there is a narrowing of the curriculum that has caused
schools to reduce the number of electives offered or to
reduce the instructional time provided for noncontent elec-
tives to meet state-mandated test requirements. Thus,
research provides data to support the fact that elective
instruction, as it relates to CTE, would assist educators in
making decisions for their schools regarding these courses.
Population
The population for this study was the 131 school divisions
in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Data submitted to the
VDOE by each school division served as the database for
this study. CTE and divisional data for this study are public
domain regarding CTE completers' English reading and
mathematics SOL pass rates and graduation rates as a result
of information submitted to the VDOE annually.
Data Collection
Data collected for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 school years
with regard to SOL student performance as well as gradu-
ation data for the same years were used for evaluation. For
the purposes of this study, student achievement was mea-
sured by Grade 11 English reading and mathematics SOL
pass rates. The mathematics data were based on the highest
level taken during the adequate yearly progress reporting
year. Data used for this study were gathered from the
VDOE Office of Educational Information Management
and the VDOE websites. Three VDOE website reports pro-
vided much of the data necessary for this study:
1. CTE Annual Performance Report (by school divi-
sion),
2. VDOE School Division Report Card and Virginia
Assessment Results, and
3. VDOE High School Graduates and Completion
report.
Student achievement in Virginia is measured by the SOL
assessments, and they serve as the high-stakes assessment
that determines student graduation and school accreditation.
High school students are expected to pass a minimum of two
English, one mathematics, one science, one social studies,
and one student-selected end-of-course assessment to gradu-
ate from a Virginia high school. Data on school division
report cards include student achievement based on the grade
level of the students in the division and end-of-course
assessment results. By definition in the Commonwealth of
Virginia, a CTE "completer" is a student who has met the
CTE's two sequential elective concentration of courses
and all requirements for high school graduation (VDOE,
2010). Therefore, data for this study include Grade 11
English reading and mathematics (highest level) SOL results
for the reported completers and non-CTE completers during
the identified school years to provide a conventional com-
parison. Groups were compared based on their high-stakes
test scores over 3 years.
Last, the High School Graduates and Completion report
collects data on an annual basis during the fall, following
students' completion year. Each locality submits data for
their schools for the combined regular and summer terms.
The data are then compiled, and division and state totals are
calculated (VDOE, 2010). This report provides graduation
numbers for each of the 131 school divisions in the
Commonwealth of Virginia. Data collected on the cohort
graduates for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 school years were
used for this study.
Research Design
According to Cohen, Manion, Morrison, and Morrison
(2007), ex post facto research is also called causal-comparative
research. In ex post facto research, there is an attempt to relate
an after-the-fact treatment that cannot be manipulated by the
investigator to an outcome or dependent measure. The spe-
cific type of ex post facto research design that was used in this
study is criterion group. The "phenomenon" or "variable" in
this study is CTE concentration. The dependent variables are
student achievement and graduation rates.
The data for the school divisions were divided into two
categories: CTE completers and non-CTE completers. CTE
completers are students who have met the requirements for a
CTE concentration and all requirements for high school
graduation or an approved alternative education program.
4 SAGE Open
Completers have passed at least 80% of the program compe-
tencies in an approved CTE concentration sequence or set of
sequential electives. Non-CTE completers are students who
have not completed an approved CTE concentration.
The independent variable group was categorized as CTE
completers and non-CTE completers. The CTE "completer"
achievement data were obtained from the CTE Performance
reports for each school division. For the purposes of this
study, the Grade 11 English reading SOL pass rates were used
for student achievement in English, and the mathematics SOL
data were based on students attaining a passing score on high-
est level of mathematics end-of-course test as reported by the
VDOE. The graduation data were derived from the VDOE
Graduation and Completion report, and the CTE Performance
reports for each of the school divisions. These dependent
variable data, student achievement and graduation rates, were
downloaded from VDOE to an Excel spreadsheet for analy-
sis. Student achievement was reviewed for the 2008, 2009,
and 2010 school years.
Data Collection Procedures
The various data collected for this study were based on the
research questions. Information from the VDOE State
Division report cards,VDOE Career andTechnical Education
Performance reports, and the VDOE Graduation and
Completion report are submitted annually to the
Commonwealth. The data were analyzed using statistical
measures to determine the differences in the performance of
each of the identified groups--CTE completers and non-
CTE completers. A spreadsheet was developed to organize
the collected data for further analysis.
Data Analysis
In analyzing data for this quantitative study, Microsoft
Excel and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS) were used to do the statistical calculations. Statistics
were generated for SOL English reading, SOL mathemat-
ics, and graduation rates for CTE completers and non-CTE
completers for each school division in the Commonwealth
of Virginia. Longitudinal data for 3 years were compared
to assess whether CTE concentration affects student
achievement. Data were analyzed using descriptive statis-
tics, including frequencies, means, and standard devia-
tions. The descriptive statistics were used to describe what
was occurring in the data. The numbers of CTE completers
and non-CTE completers as well as the corresponding
dependent variables for each category were calculated.
Total CTE completer students by school division were
marked as such with codes, as were the students who had
not completed an approved concentration sequence.
A t-test analysis was used to assess whether the means of
the two sample groups (CTE completers vs. non-CTE com-
pleters) were statistically different from each other. To test
the level of significance, an alpha level of .05 was used to
determine whether there was a significant difference in the
means of the two groups. Permission to conduct the study
was requested and approved from the Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University's Institutional Review Board.
Results
The Commonwealth of Virginia had more than 110,000
students who participated in CTE to the level of being con-
sidered CTE completers. CTE completers are students who
have taken two sequential CTE electives in a prescribed
program area with 80% proficiency in the competencies
required for the courses.
For the purposes of this study, the reading data were
based on the end-of-course Grade 11 English reading SOL
assessment. The mathematics data were based on the math-
ematics course for which a SOL assessment is required. The
SOL assessments are given in the spring of each school
year. All students enrolled in end-of-year courses (EOC)
take the associated EOC SOL test. In each of the years of
this study, CTE completer pass rates outperformed those of
the rest of the students on the reading SOL by at least 3%
points. In the area of mathematics during the years of 2009
and 2010, CTE completers had pass rates of 7% to 10%
points higher than the rest of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
The only exception was during the 2008-2009 school year,
where the CTE completer mathematics pass rate was lower
than the pass rate of the state. During the year of 2008, the
state pass rate on the Algebra I, Algebra II, and Geometry
SOL was 91%, whereas the performance of CTE completers
for that same year was only 84%.
Research Question 1--Results
What is the difference, if any, between high school CTE
enrollment status (CTE completer vs. non-CTE completer)
and student achievement as measured by SOL mathematics
pass rates of the highest level of mathematics completed
(Algebra I, Algebra II, and/or Geometry)?
A breakdown of school divisions by mathematics SOL
pass rate categories was organized to illustrate the number
of school divisions by CTE enrollment status that fell within
the selected pass rate bands. In 2008, 57 school divisions
had a CTE pass rate in mathematics below 82%. However,
the following 2 school years, more than 120 school divi-
sions had CTE pass rates in mathematics above 95%. In the
category of non-CTE completers, an average of 22 school
divisions had mathematics pass rates above 95%.
Descriptive statistics were calculated for the CTE com-
pleters and non-CTE completers for the years of the study.
Using the rescaled student population numbers, the data were
imported into SPSS for analysis. The mean mathematics SOL
pass rate for non-CTE completers in 2008 was 90.65 with a
standard deviation of 5.14, and CTE completers had a mean
Blowe and Price 5
pass rate of 82.91 with a standard deviation of 9.55 for that
same year. In the years of 2009 and 2010, CTE completers
had mean pass rates of 97.86 with a standard deviation of
2.05 and 97.61 with a standard deviation of 2.26, respectively.
Non-CTE completers for the same school years had mean
pass rates of 88.53 with a standard deviation of 5.37 and
88.83 with a standard deviation of 6.22. The highest mean
mathematics pass rate was among the CTE completers in
2009 at 97.86, and the lowest mean mathematics pass rate
was also among the CTE completers in 2008 at 82.91.
On further analysis of the data, an examination of stan-
dardized coefficients of skewness and kurtosis was conducted
to determine the normality of the distribution. The coefficient
of skewness provided information regarding the degree of
departure of the data from that of a normal distribution. The
skewness of the distribution of data must be determined to
evaluate whether the distribution is significantly skewed to
the left or right tail of the distribution. If the skewness is
within the range of +3 or -3, then it is not seriously violated.
The coefficient of kurtosis provided information regarding
the peakness of the distribution or the concentration of data to
the center, the upper and lower ends, and the shoulder. A nor-
mal distribution will have a kurtosis value of 0, with a range
of normality of ±3. With 11 of the 12 skewness and kurtosis
factors beyond the range of ±3, it was determined that each of
the distributions depart from that of a normal curve for the
dependent variable of mathematics SOL pass rates. A total of
11 of the 12 coefficients calculated are beyond the range for a
normal distribution.
As the mathematics SOL pass rates for CTE completers
and non-CTE completers were not normally distributed, a
nonparametricstatisticalprocedurewasused.Nonparametric
statistics are used when the data do not fit in a normal
distribution. Nonparametric statistics are also referred to as
distribution free in that the statistical procedures are not
assuming that the data fall within a normal distribution and
reduce the influence of outliers on the statistic results.
Accordingly, a Wilcoxon's t test was used to address
the research question. A Wilcoxon's t test is used to compare
two related samples to assess whether their means differ.
AWilcoxon's t test assumes that the data are not normally dis-
tributed and that the data are ordinal in nature. The results
indicate that there is a statistically significant difference (p <
.05) in the performance of CTE completers on the mathemat-
ics SOLs, p < .001. Cohen's d effect size was also calculated
to measure the strength of the difference between the vari-
ables. This statistic measures the overlap of the data of one
sample group to that of the other. Based on Cohen's effect size
criteria, size of d  0.8 indicates the nonoverlap of the distribu-
tions. In each of the years of the study, the effect size was
found to be large (2008, d = 1.01; 2009, d = 2.29; and 2010,
d = 1.88) for the mathematics SOL passing rates. CTE com-
pleters had a statistically significant difference in their pass
rates on the mathematics end-of-course SOL test as compared
with their non-CTE completer counterparts.
Research Question 2--Results
What is the difference, if any, between high school CTE
enrollment status (CTE completer vs. non-CTE completer)
and student achievement as measured by Grade 11 English
reading SOL pass rates?
When considering the second research question, Grade
11 English reading SOL pass rates were examined. School
division pass rates were initially reviewed based on the fre-
quency of school divisions in the pass rate bands. Nearly all
of the CTE completer school division pass rates were at
89% or above. Only one of the CTE completer school divi-
sions in the 3 years of this study had a pass rate below 89%,
whereas non-CTE completer pass rates were on average
evenly split above and below 89%.
The mean CTE completer pass rates for the 3 years
examined in this study were higher than non-CTE. The
mean CTE completer pass rate for the English reading SOL
in 2008 was 97.53 as compared with the mean 2008 non-
CTE completer pass rate of 90.39. In 2009, the mean CTE
completer pass rate was 97.99 with non-CTE completers
having a mean pass rate of 89.16. Furthermore, the highest
mean Grade 11 English reading SOL pass rate was among
CTE completers in 2009 with a mean pass rate of 97.99 and
a standard deviation of 1.83.
An examination of the standardized skewness coefficient
and the standardized kurtosis coefficient for the English
reading SOL passing rates revealed that the distribution of
the data departs from that of a normal distribution. As the
English reading SOL scores of the CTE students were not
normally distributed, a Wilcoxon's t test was used to address
the second research question.
Further analysis of the Grade 11 English reading SOL
pass rates was used to determine whether there was a differ-
ence in students' performance on the assessment with
regard to CTE enrollment status. The findings of the
Wilcoxon's t-test analysis conducted on the data indicated
that there was a significant difference in the performance of
CTE completers to non-CTE completers (p < .001). The
t test yielded a statistically significant result for each of the
years examined. This t-test statistic also represents that the
likelihood of this happening by chance is 5% or less. The
acceptable level of significance for social sciences is .05;
however, the significance level of .000 is well under the .05
level and the more stringent .01. This analysis revealed a
statistically significant difference in the Grade 11 English
reading SOL performance and pass rates of CTE com-
pleters than that of non-CTE completers.
The effect size associated with the difference in the Grade
11 English reading SOL pass rates, Cohen's d, was calcu-
lated on the data to illustrate the magnitude of the difference
between the groups. In each instance, the Cohen's d effect
size was found to be large (2008, d = 1.32; 2009, d = 1.60;
and 2010, d = 1.02) for each year. Cohen's d equal to or
above 0.8 indicates a large effect size (d  0.8). The large
6 SAGE Open
effect size emphasizes the size of the difference in the mean
English reading SOL pass rates of the two groups in this
study. Large effect size as defined by Cohen equates
to "grossly perceptible," and therefore corresponds to the
finding of CTE completers Grade 11 English reading SOL
pass rates above those of students who have not completed a
prescribed set of CTE courses and are not considered CTE
completers.
Research Question 3--Results
What is the difference, if any, between high school CTE
enrollment status (CTE completer vs. non-CTE completer)
and the graduation rates of students?
When evaluating the third research question, graduation
rates were gathered for the groups evaluated in this study. The
cohort graduation rates were included based on the graduation
band in which the school divisions'performance dictates. The
highest mean graduation rate was among the CTE completers
in 2008 with a mean of 98.08 and a standard deviation of 8.77.
This mean is notably higher than the mean graduation rate for
non-CTE completers in that same year of 85.50 with a stan-
dard deviation of 7.66. The extreme difference in the mean
graduation rates may be an indication of the change in report-
ing of high school graduates in response to on-time graduation
rates and the mandates of NCLB. Mean CTE completer grad-
uation rates remained above 90% for the 3 years of the study,
whereas non-CTE completer cohort graduation rates were in
the mid-80% range. School year 2010 had the lowest mean
CTE completer graduation rate (94.90), whereas the non-CTE
completers in that same year had their highest cohort gradua-
tion rates (88.88). Although the non-CTE completers had an
increase in their mean graduation rate, it was still nearly 10%
points below that of CTE completers.
An examination of the graduation rates of the participants
of this study to that of a normal distribution remains consistent
with the findings for the previous two research questions. A
review of the histogram and the coefficients of skewness and
kurtosis indicated that the data were not normally distributed.
Because the data for the graduation rates were not normally
distributed as proven by the coefficients of skewness and kur-
tosis, the nonparametric statistic was used for these data as
well. The Wilcoxon's t test yielded a statistically significant
difference between CTE completers and non-CTE completers
with regard to graduation rates, z = -9.350, -9.208, and
-8.102, p < .001, for the respective years of 2008, 2009, and
2010.
Delving deeper into the results of the Wilcoxon, the effect
size associated with the difference in the graduation pass
rates was found to be large using Cohen's d criteria. The
effect sizes calculated were 1.53, 1.54, and 1.19 for the years
2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. A large effect size illus-
trated the difference between the CTE completers and non-
CTE completers based on graduation rates in standard
deviation units. Therefore, the distributions of the graduation
rates for these groups do not extensively overlap. The results
of the study are presented in three sections based on the guid-
ingresearchquestions.Thedependentvariablesfortheresearch
questions were Grade 11 English reading SOL pass rates,
mathematics SOL pass rates (Algebra I, Algebra II, and
Geometry), and graduation rates. The first structure analyzed
in the section "Research Question 1--Results" was the student
achievement of CTE completers and non-CTE completers
based on the pass rates for the highest mathematics SOL taken.
The t-test analysis revealed that there was a difference in the
student achievement of students on mathematics SOLs based
on CTE enrollment status. This result was found to be true for
each of the years of the study.
The second structure analyzed was the Grade 11 English
reading pass rates for the populations in the study. The
descriptive statistics and t-test analysis revealed that there
was a significant difference in the student achievement of
CTE completers and non-CTE completers on the Grade 11
English reading SOL. The academic achievement of this
group of students proved consistent for the 3 years of the
study with nearly all the CTE completer school divisions
having pass rates above 90%.
The third section focused on the graduation rates of stu-
dents based on CTE enrollment status. As with the Grade 11
English reading SOL pass rates for CTE completers, the
graduation rates for this group of students indicated that
nearly 95% of the school divisions had CTE completer grad-
uation rates above 90%. As the accountability requirements
of NCLB continue to increase, these data will become
increasingly important to school divisions.
Each of the sections outlines specific data regarding the
research questions, data collection and rescaling proce-
dures, relevant descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon's t test, and
effect size for the dependent variables of this study. The data
analyzed and data tables representing each of the indepen-
dent variable groups have been presented.
Findings, Implications for Further
Study, and Reflections
The purpose of this study was to investigate the academic
performance of CTE completers and non-CTE completers in
the Commonwealth of Virginia on the SOL English and
mathematics assessments as well as cohort graduation rates.
This study focused on the pass rates and graduation rates for
each of the 131 schools divisions in the Commonwealth of
Virginia based on data that were reported to the Department
of Education. There were two independent variables in the
study based on CTE concentration status. Participants of the
study were categorized as CTE completers or non-CTE
completers. The three dependent variables were the pass
rates on the Grade 11 English reading SOL and the mathe-
matics SOL pass rates for which the students were enrolled.
The graduation rate data were based on the cohort informa-
tion as reported to the VDOE.
Blowe and Price 7
One of the intents of this study was to determine whether
CTE is a viable program that can contribute to the academic
proficiencies required for high-stakes testing, such as
Virginia's SOL. Furthermore, this study is intended to be a
medium to provide quantifiable data to public school divi-
sions when making decisions regarding curriculum and
program evaluation in this era of accountability and NCLB.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the academic
performance of CTE completers and non-CTE completers
in the Commonwealth of Virginia on the SOL English reading
and mathematics assessments as well as cohort graduation
rates.
Discussion of Findings
First, in the study populations, CTE completers earned
higher mean pass rates on the mathematics SOLs during the
2008-2009 and 2009-2010 school years. Specifically, CTE
completers had a mean pass rate of 9% points higher than
non-CTE completers during the 2009 and 2010 school
years. These results suggest that CTE completers do outper-
form their non-CTE counterparts on mathematics SOLs.
Second, the pass rate for CTE completers was higher than
that of the non-CTE completers on the Grade 11 English
reading SOL. The mean reading SOL pass rates for CTE
completers during the years of this study were 7% to 8%
points higher than that of the non-CTE completers. Third,
CTE completers also attained mean high school cohort
graduation rates of 6% to 13% higher than non-CTE com-
pleters for the years of the study. Students in CTE courses
graduated with their cohort of classmates at an average
graduation rate of 96%, whereas the average non-CTE
cohort graduation rate was 87% for the three academic
years of the study.
Implications for Practice
The results of this study indicate that CTE affects student
achievement and graduation rates. As school divisions make
decisions regarding cutting CTE programs, the results of this
study should be reviewed as it concludes that students who
complete a CTE sequence of courses demonstrate higher
mathematics, reading, and graduation pass rates. Several
implications for practice were identified from the findings of
this study. The research indicates that there are mixed
reviews regarding CTE's impact on student achievement and
graduation rates. These inconclusive studies served as the
impetus for this study in the Commonwealth of Virginia and
the desire of the researcher to investigate the performance of
CTE completers in the state. Based on the implications
below, educators should explore further the role of CTE in
the achievement of students.
Implication 1. School administrators interested in increas-
ing mathematics and reading SOL performance should
encourage more students to enroll in and complete CTE
sequenced courses. For this study, CTE completers demon-
strated a statistically significant higher pass rate on the math-
ematics and Grade 11 English reading SOL than their
non-CTE counterparts. Therefore, school divisions and edu-
cational leaders should encourage enrollment of students in
CTE courses.
Implication 2. School administrators interested in increas-
ing cohort graduation rates should encourage more students
to enroll in and complete CTE sequenced courses. Based on
the results of this study, the CTE completer cohorts had an
average graduation rate of 95%, which was well above the
average for non-CTE completers during the same years.
Implication 3. School administrators should encourage
non-CTE completers in CTE courses to complete a sequence
of CTE courses and become completers. Increasing the num-
ber of non-CTE completers taking sequenced courses and
becoming completers would benefit school divisions and
students. As evidenced by the pass rates of CTE completers,
student participation in courses that are not included in the
state-mandated testing could prove to be as valuable for
future plans as time spent preparing for the required aca-
demic assessments (Daggett, 2005).
Implication 4. Career and technical educators should con-
tinue to document and collect data on the performance
of program completers to monitor CTE effectiveness. To
promote CTE as a program viable in meeting benchmarks,
disaggregated data regarding specific program areas and
course work should be investigated. In this time of narrow-
ing curriculum and data-driven decisions, CTE must con-
tinue to collect, document, and promote CTE courses.
Implication 5. School administrators should evaluate
instructional practices used in CTE courses for their merit
and value with integrated instruction. Educators acknowledge
that students learn more when the work is connected to their
interests, to real-world problems, and the world of work and
college.
Recommendations for Further Research
Daggett (2009) states that for CTE to establish and maintain
itself as a viable component of the comprehensive school
program, there is a need to determine how students who
have completed a CTE concentration of sequenced courses
perform on state high-stakes tests. Therefore, the researchers
recommend that more quantitative studies are conducted to
determine the impact of career of technical education on the
academic achievement and graduation rates of students.
Researchers note that there are limited studies on the impact
of CTE on NCLB and high-stakes testing. Thus, there is
much more quantitative research that should be done.
Little information exists regarding the academic perfor-
mance of CTE concentrators on high-stakes state assess-
ments. There are numerous national studies and anecdotal
data regarding CTE student performance, but given the
increased focus on NCLB benchmarks, the researchers
8 SAGE Open
discovered limited research on CTE performance on the
high-stakes standardized tests required by each state. With
the growing accountability requirements, it is especially
important for CTE teachers and administrators to take this
opportunity to highlight the success of their program areas
and courses as it relates to student progress and graduation
rates.
Instructional practices and contextual learning strategies
used in CTE courses produce the successful student academic
performance as demonstrated in this study. This investigation
of Virginia's CTE completer pass rates compared with stu-
dents who have not completed a CTE program and students'
success on the SOL assessments.
As the nation begins to embrace the concept of 21st century
skills, performance-based learning, and President Obama's
college and career readiness initiatives, it is time for CTE to
showcase how its programs support and encompass these con-
cepts. Daggett (2009) suggests that CTE must continue to
clearly demonstrate that these programs contribute to the aca-
demic success of students and motivates students to stay in
school through graduation.
