Introduction
Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major socioeconomic bur-
den.1,2 End-stage knee OA is most often treated with a total
knee arthroplasty (TKA).3 When TKA is performed in
patients younger than 65 years, the chance for revision sur-
gery is significant.4 Revision surgery is considerably more
difficult, costly, and generally less effective, leading to
increased complication and mortality rates.4
In a population with increasing obesity, a relative
younger population is increasingly at risk for development
of OA. Moreover, life expectancy is increasing, increasing
the risk for revision surgery later in life. Therefore, the need
arises for joint preserving strategies.5 Since structural tissue
damage is a probable cause for pain and functional limita-
tion, joint preserving treatment focusses on tissue repair,
accompanied by clinical benefit.
High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is a well-known joint preserv-
ing procedure to treat unicompartmental knee OAby correct-
ing a deviated mechanical leg-axis, with that unloading the

Abstract
Objective. High tibial osteotomy (HTO) and knee joint distraction (KJD) are treatments to unload the osteoarthritic (OA)
joint with proven success in postponing a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). While both treatments demonstrate joint repair,
there is limited information about the quality of the regenerated tissue. Therefore, the change in quality of the repaired
cartilaginous tissue after KJD and HTO was studied using delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of
cartilage (dGEMRIC). Design. Forty patients (20 KJD and 20 HTO), treated for medial tibiofemoral OA, were included in
this study. Radiographic outcomes, clinical characteristics, and cartilage quality were evaluated at baseline, and at 1- and
2-year follow-up. Results. Two years after KJD treatment, clear clinical improvement was observed. Moreover, a statistically
significant increased medial ( 0.99 mm), minimal ( 1.04 mm), and mean ( 0.68 mm) radiographic joint space width (JSW)
was demonstrated. Likewise, medial ( 1.03 mm), minimal ( 0.72 mm), and mean ( 0.46 mm) JSW were statistically
significantly increased on radiographs after HTO. There was on average no statistically significant change in dGEMRIC
indices over two years and no difference between treatments. Yet there seemed to be a clinically relevant, positive relation
between increase in cartilage quality and patients' experienced clinical benefit. Conclusions. Treatment of knee OA by either
HTO or KJD leads to clinical benefit, and an increase in cartilage thickness on weightbearing radiographs for over 2 years
posttreatment. This cartilaginous tissue was on average not different from baseline, as determined by dGEMRIC, whereas
changes in quality at the individual level correlated with clinical benefit.

damaged compartment.6-8 Many studies show good clinical
results, with high and prolonged survival rates,6 and even
structural cartilage repair.9,10 Asystematic review shows oste-
otomies can delay TKA with a median of 7 years.11
Knee joint distraction (KJD) is a less known joint pre-
serving treatment and indicated for both unilateral and gen-
eralized knee OA. KJD is performed by placing an external
fixation device for 6 weeks, allowing for a renewal of the
joint homeostasis, where anabolic activity takes over cata-
bolic activity, providing a more healthy environment
enabling tissue repair.12,13 Studies have demonstrated a pro-
gressive decrease in pain, normalization of function, and a
sustained increase in cartilage thickness as seen on weight-
bearing radiographs.14-17 Arthroscopy14-16 and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)14,18 evaluation showed cartilage
repair after KJD.As a surrogate marker for cartilage quality,
biochemical markers for collagen type-II turnover demon-
strated an increase of synthesis over release.18 In a prospec-
tive open uncontrolled study, KJD proved to be successful
in postponing TKA for at least 5 years in more than 75% of
the treated patients.19 Postponing a TKA over 10 years was
reported to occur in two-third of patients treated with KJD
based on data of small groups.20
HTO and KJD aim to permanently partially (HTO) or
temporarily completely (KJD) alleviate the biomechanical
load on the affected cartilage. Moreover, both treatments
result in cartilaginous tissue repair and clinical benefit.
Therefore, the effects of these treatments were directly com-
pared in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Recently, the
1-year evaluation of this RCT was reported.21 All patient-
reported outcome measures were improved after 1 year (P <
0.02) as well as an increased joint space width (JSW) of the
medial compartment on both KJD (0.8 ± 1.0 mm, P = 0.001)
and HTO (0.4 ± 0.5 mm, P < 0.001). In the KJD group (in
contrast to the HTO group), the lateral compartment also
showed an increased JSW, resulting in a statistically signifi-
cant increase in overall mean JSW (P < 0.02).21
Following reports of structural repair, the next step is to
assess cartilage quality, preferably using noninvasive tech-
niques. Quantitative MRI analysis, in the form of delayed
gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of carti-
lage (dGEMRIC) relies on the relationship between the
highly negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and
the negatively charged MRI contrast agent gadolinium, pro-
viding a measure of quality of the cartilaginous tissue, spe-
cifically with regard to GAG content.22 In OA, the highly
negatively charged GAG are lost and when intravenously
injected, the MRI contrast agent gadolinium, reaches the
patients' joints and penetrates the cartilage in an inverse
proportional manner.22 The qualitative state of the cartilage
is thereby represented as dGEMRIC indices; low dGEM-
RIC indices represent low GAG content, namely degener-
ated cartilage, and high dGEMRIC indices higher GAG
content, namely more healthy cartilage.23
Although cartilaginous tissue repair is shown for both
HTO and KJD, imaging data on cartilage quality are
scarce. In case of HTO, there is only 1 case report series
published and a few studies reporting on dGEMRIC
changes; 6 months,9,23 9 months,24 12 months,9,23 and 24
months9 posttreatment in humans. Although positive
results were obtained, none of these studies could confirm
(statistically) significant cartilage quality changes on
treatment with HTO. For KJD such data are not present.
In the present explorative study, the change in quality of
the repaired cartilaginous tissue two years after KJD or after
HTO treatment was investigated using dGEMRIC. In addi-
tion, it was evaluated whether these changes are related to
radiographic changes and clinical outcome.
Methods
Patients
For this explorative study patients were included originat-
ing from 2 independent RCTs (Fig. 1; NL 35856.041.11 and
NL 34296.041.10). Patients with medial compartmental
knee OAconsidered for HTO according to regular practice,21
randomized to either KJD or HTO (1:2) were asked to par-
ticipate in this extended imaging study. Because of the rela-
tive low number of KJD versus HTO patients, caused by the
randomization ratio, KJD patients from an RCT comparing
TKA with KJD25 were additionally added to this study.
These patients were, according to regular practice, consid-
ered for TKA surgery and randomized to either KJD or
TKA (1:2).
For both studies, patients younger than 65 years, with
varus deformity, Kellgren and Lawrence (K-L) score >2,
intact ligaments, normal range-of-motion (flexion >120°;
flexion-limitation <15°), normal stability, and a body mass
index (BMI) <35 kg/m2 were included. Exclusion criteria
included any history of inflammatory- or rheumatoid
arthritis, posttraumatic fibrosis due to fracture of the tibia
plateau, full bone-to-bone contact (absence of any JSW on
X-ray), surgical treatment of the involved knee <6 months
ago, and primary (isolated) patella-femoral OA. Patients
with an infectious susceptible prosthesis in situ and/or
contralateral knee OAthat needed treatment were excluded
as well.
After patients' written consent to participate in 1 of the
2 RCTs, they were additionally asked to participate in the
current study extending the standard MRI measurements
with additional imaging modalities, including dGEMRIC
to measure proteoglycan content/distribution. When com-
paring the demographics of the original KJD and HTO
groups with those of this extended imaging study, only
the proportion of males in the HTO group is statistically
significantly higher, which was considered coincidental
(Table 1).
Besselink et al. 3
Ethical approval was obtained (NL 38442.041.11), and
the study was performed in accordance with the ethical
principles from the Declaration of Helsinki. The first 20
patients who gave written informed consent treated with
HTO and the first 20 patients of both RCTs treated with
KJD who gave written informed consent were included.
Treatment
KJD was performed by placing an external fixation
device, ensuring 5 mm distraction during a period of 6
weeks.26 In HTO, the aim was to shift the weightbearing
line laterally, with the postoperative mechanical axis run-
ning laterally through the tibial plateau, at 62% of its
entire width (measured from the medial side). HTO
patients were hospitalized for 3 days, followed by 6 weeks
of limited weightbearing. At 18 months, the plate was
removed to allow MRI at 2 years. Treatment radiographs
are shown in Figure 2. Both joint-preserving treatments
have been described in more detail previously26 and in the
supplementary file (available in the online version of the
article).
Study Assessments
For the present study, evaluations were performed before
treatment (baseline), at 1 years, and at 2 years after treatment.
Patients undergoing HTO did not undergo dGEMRIC MRI at
12 months due to the metal-plate in situ.
Function and Pain
Clinical effectiveness was determined by the WOMAC
(Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
Index) 3.0 index derived from the KOOS (Knee injury and
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) questionnaire (self-assess-
ment reduced from 5 to 3 dimensions and using a 5-point
Likert-type scale, normalizing to a 100-point scale, where
100 is no pain). Pain was measured by a visual analogue
scale (VAS-Pain), a continuous scale ranging from 0 (no
pain) to 100 (worst imaginable pain), on which the patient
indicated the amount of pain.
Weightbearing Radiographs and Joint Space
Width Measurements
Standardized semiflexed weightbearing radiographs were
acquired at inclusion and 2 years after treatment to deter-
mine the K-L grade (K-L at baseline) according to a stan-
dardized protocol and to evaluate changes in JSW over time
using Knee Images Digital Analysis (KIDA) software,27

sures; mean medial, and mean lateral JSW, mean of the total
joint (mean JSW), and minimal JSW of the total joint. The

either of the randomized trials (NL 35856.041.11 or NL 34296.041.10) were asked to participate in this extended imaging trial (NL
38442.041.11). Additional dGEMRIC imaging was performed at baseline and after 2 years for HTO patients, and at baseline, and after
1 and 2 years for knee joint distraction (KJD) patients.

aHTO and KJD patients' characteristics within the extended imaging cohort are compared. As expected considering the original inclusion,21 age, and baseline Kellgren and Lawrence (K-L) score were
statistically significant higher in the KJD group than in the HTO group. Also lateral JSW was higher for the KJD group, which was considered a coincidence. No other statistical differences were
observed. For difference in K-L grade between groups, chi-square tests for trend are used. P < 0.05 is statistically significant (grayed out boxes are statistically significant).

dGEMRIC Acquisition
After scout images, dGEMRIC scans were performed on a
clinical 3-tesla MRI scanner (Achieva 3T; Philips Medical
Systems) using a 16-channel knee coil. The 3-dimensional
imaging protocol consisted of a sagittal inversion recovery
fast spoiled gradient-recalled echo (FSPGR) sequence with
5 settings for the inversion time (TI) (50; 150; 350; 650;
1650 ms), based on previously published work.24 An addi-
tional phantom experiment (data not shown) showed that no
significant variations in measured T1 values were present
over the range of slices analyzed in our study. The repetition
time (TR) was 10 ms. Other parameters were: flip angle = 15°,
echo time = 3 ms, field of view = 160 × 145.2 × 108 mm3,
in-plane voxel size = 0.625 × 0.625 × 3 mm3, and matrix
size = 260 × 234 × 36. Prior to scanning, patients received
an intravenous injection of 0.2 mM/kg gadolinium-based
contrast agent (Gd-DTPA; Magnevist by Bayer Schering
Pharma). Subsequently, patients performed a standardized light
exercise, by walking a predefined route for approximately
15 minutes, and rested until 90 minutes after contrast infu-
sion before the MRI scan was made (dGEMRIC sequences
including scout images took 20 minutes and 30 seconds).
dGEMRIC Index Estimation
Segmentation was performed on dGEMRIC images of
every patient, acquired at baseline and follow up by 2 inde-
pendent observers (NB, AC), blinded for time point and
treatment. This segmentation provided a total of 12 regions
of interest (ROIs), divided in anterior (a), central (c) and
posterior (p) regions of the tibia (T) or femur (F) on the
medial (M) or lateral (L) side of the knee (Fig. 3). ROIs
were manually delineated on the sagittal images obtained in
the dGEMRIC scan with inversion time of 1650 ms (TI =
1650 ms) according to the method described by Eckstein
et al.24,28 The central and both adjacent slices through both
tibiofemoral joint compartments were manually selected.
ROIs were delineated, using in-house developed software
(ImageXplorer, Image Sciences Institute).
Phase-corrected real data reconstruction (allowing for
noise reduction), and image registration were performed on
the 3-dimensional images with 5 different inversion time
settings (TI = 50; 150; 350; 650; 1650 ms) before fitting.29,30
Eventually, all sequences were rigidly transformed to TI =
1650 ms using an intensity-based image registration, and
alignment was visually inspected.
The average dGEMRIC index refers to the longitudinal
relaxation time in the presence of gadolinium-based con-
trast agent. Voxel-wise fitting of the dGEMRIC signal using
Figure 2. Posteroanterior radiographs of knee joint distraction (left) and high tibial osteotomy (right).
6 Cartilage 00(0)
the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least-squares method
with in-house developed software (R2015a, The
MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) produced a reconstructed
T1 map. From this T1 map, the average dGEMRIC index
was calculated for each compartment and ROI separately.
The dGEMRIC index map was then superimposed onto the
scan acquired for TI = 1650 ms, see Figure 4. A color scale
was used, representing the condition of the cartilage, rang-
ing from degenerated toward healthy (low GAG content
results in a low dGEMRIC index, and vice versa).
Statistical Analysis
Changes in WOMAC, VAS Pain, radiographic JSW, and
dGEMRIC signal (per side and region) were presented
using mean with SD or median with interquartile range.
WOMAC, VAS Pain, and JWS changes were evaluated
(without correction for multiple testing) by paired t tests
and differences in changes scores between KJD and HTO
using independent tests.
To account for clustering of dGEMRIC indices within
the different regions analyzed, changes in dGEMRIC
scores from baseline to follow-up, over all regions were
analyzed using multilevel analysis (i.e., a linear mixed-
effects model) with a random intercept at region level. In
this analysis, the average change in dGEMRIC indices
over time was estimated, as well as the effect of treatment
and of side (medial or lateral) on this change. The associa-
tion of change in dGEMRIC indices with change in
WOMAC, change in JSW, and modification of these asso-
ciations by side and by treatment was also evaluated with
multilevel analysis and if relevant, based on size of regres-
sion coefficient of the interaction term and a P < 0.20, sub-
group analyses were performed.
All tests were 2-sided, and a probability of P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant unless specified other-
wise. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
(Version 21.0. IBM Corp, Armonk, NY).
Results
Patients
Three out of 20 KJD and 2 out of 20 HTO patients were lost
to follow-up due to conversion to HTO (in case of KJD) or
total knee arthroplasty (TKA; in case of HTO) within 2
years (Fig. 1). In addition, 1 KJD patient had severe motion
artifacts in the dGEMRIC acquisition. As the HTO patients
all have medial compartment OA, 2 KJD patients with pre-
dominantly lateral compartmental OA were excluded to
allow for a proper comparison between groups. This
resulted in a total of 14 KJD and 18 HTO patients analyzed
(see Fig. 1). Baseline characteristics of these patients are
given in Table 1. There were no statistically significant dif-
ferences in dGEMRIC indices at baseline between the KJD
and the HTO patients.
Clinical and Radiographic Changes after HTO or
KJD
One and 2 years after either treatment, a statistically signifi-
cant increase in WOMAC and decrease in VAS-Pain com-
pared with baseline was observed (Fig. 5). The 1-year
results of this subcohort are fully in line with the previously
published 1-year results of the entire cohorts from both
original RCTs.21,31
One year after KJD, a statistically significant increase in
medial, minimal, and mean JSW was found, this increase
was still significant after 2 years. A statistically significant
increase in medial and minimal JSW was found after 1 year
in the HTO group, which also sustained at 2 years. After 2
years, a statistically significant increase in mean JSW after
HTO was observed, which was not present at 1-year follow-
up yet. JSW findings were substantiated by volumetric
cartilage assessments of the delineated cartilage, total knee
volume increases after both KJD and HTO, ruling out
biasing of JSW changes by an altered mechanical axis (both

P < 0.05, data not shown). Radiographic parameters did not
change significantly between year 1 and 2 (Fig. 5 and
Supplementary Table 1).
There was no statistically significant difference between
both treatments with regard to the change in WOMAC, VAS-
Pain, and JSW parameters after 2 years. However, at 1 year
after treatment, these parameters were statistically significant
different for medial JSW change (KJD:  1.28 mm, HTO: 
0.52 mm, P = 0.049), and minimal JSW change (KJD:  0.95
mm, HTO:  0.32 mm, P = 0.011); all in favor of KJD.
dGEMRIC Evaluation
Interobserver reproducibility of the segmentation process
was evaluated by comparing the average dGEMRIC values
of the ROIs (Supplementary Figure 1). The interobserver
reproducibility was high (intraclass correlation coefficient
[ICC] = 0.96); therefore, dGEMRIC indices of both observ-
ers were averaged for all further analyses. Average absolute
(and relative) changes in dGEMRIC values of the different
medial and lateral compartments and subregions of the tibia
and femur from baseline to 1-year and 2-year follow-up are
shown in Table 2 and are generally small (on average 3.4%).
In the multilevel analysis, the overall average dGEM-
RIC change over 2 years was nonsignificant ( -8.08; 95%
CI = -24.46 to 8.29, P = 0.260). dGEMRIC changes were
dependent on baseline dGEMRIC indices. Taking this into
account a statistically significant effect for side was found
and a possible effect of treatment was found. Table 3 shows
the effect of treatment on change in dGEMRIC indices
(corrected for the dGEMRIC baseline indices), for subgroups
regarding side and treatment type. Of both treatments, HTO
was associated with a statistically significant reduction
(cartilage worsening) in medial dGEMRIC indices (
-44.93, 95% CI = -67.94 to -21.91) and increase (carti-
lage improvement) at the lateral side ( +26.36, 95% CI =
+2.71 to +50.03). For KJD, the changes over 2 years were
not statistically significant (Table 3). Relative changes
compared with baseline were minimal32 (HTO medial:
-6.6%, P < 0.001 and lateral +3.3%, P = 0.023 and KJD
medial: -3.2% and lateral +2.1%).
Association between Change in Radiographic
and Clinical Parameters and Change in
dGEMRIC
Evaluating the association between change in JSW and
change in dGEMRIC over 2 years, possible effect modifica-
tion was also observed by side and treatment and thus
results were stratified by side and treatment (Table 4). Only
the positive association between the change in lateral JSW
and change in lateral dGEMRIC indices in patients treated
with HTO were observed; where one mm increase in JSW
was associated with an increase of about 26 dGEMRIC ms
(P = 0.007, Table 4). This effect was not found for the
medial compartment and not found after KJD for either of
the 2 compartments.
For the association between change in WOMAC and
change in dGEMRIC over 2 years, no evidence for modifi-
cation of the association by side or by treatment was found
and thus results were applicable to the total group (KJD and
HTO). Results indicate that one unit increase in WOMAC
(clinical improvement) was associated with an increase (tis-
sue structure improvement) in dGEMRIC indices of about
1.6 ms (P < 0.0001, Table 4).

scale was used, representing the condition of the cartilage, ranging from degenerative (yellow) toward healthy (blue; low GAG content
results in a low dGEMRIC index, and vice versa).

Discussion
In these subcohorts, clear clinical improvement and radio-
graphic cartilaginous tissue repair were found, without
significant change in cartilage quality as determined by
dGEMRIC at 2 years after KJD or HTO treatment. An
increase in dGEMRIC signal, increase in cartilage GAG con-

aThe 12 regions of interest (ROIs) are the anterior (a), central (c), and posterior (p) regions of the Lateral (L) or Medial (M) compartment of the
Femur (F) and Tibia (T). Delta scores might deviate from the difference between time points due to missing dGEMRIC indices for specific ROIs at
specific time points. Missing indices can, for example, be caused by cartilage being reduced to a volume so small, it is insufficient for dGEMRIC analysis.
10 Cartilage 00(0)
For this study, patients were included originating from 2
separate RCTs. There were differences in baseline charac-
teristics (of inclusion criteria) for those 2 RCTs, which was
reflected in the extended imaging cohort where a higher age
and a more severe K-L grade for KJD at baseline as com-
pared with HTO was found. This can be explained by the
fact that part of the included KJD patients (10 out of 20)
were originally considered for TKA, and these patients gen-
erally suffer from more severe OA than patients considered
for HTO. The current study might be underpowered to pro-
vide final conclusive answers due to the relative low num-
bers of patients included. Despite these limitations, these
are the first data on comparing cartilage quality between
these regenerative treatments.
One of the main reasons for patients to undergo treatment
of an OA knee is to alleviate pain and recover function.
Even in this small study, both are achieved as seen in the
clear decrease in VAS-Pain and increase in WOMAC
scores, 1 year after treatment and maintained for another
year, after either KJD or HTO. Interestingly, despite minor
changes in dGEMRIC signal, for the overall group, change
in WOMAC score was positively associated with a change
in dGEMRIC indices, independent of side or of treatment,
implying a clinically relevant correlation between increase
in cartilage quality as determined by dGEMRIC and
patients' experienced clinical benefit. The mechanism
behind this interrelation can only be speculated on.
After correction for baseline dGEMRIC indices over all
ROIs, no statistically significant differences between HTO
and KJD on change in dGEMRIC values were found. On
average, there is a decrease in medial and an increase in lat-
eral dGEMRIC indices for HTO patients. This increase in

bdGEMRIC indices from baseline over all regions were analyzed using multilevel analysis (i.e., a linear mixed-effects model), a random intercept at the
region level was included to account for clustering of dGEMRIC indices within regions. The effect treatment (KJD or HTO), side of the knee (medial
and lateral) on change in dGEMRIC indices were evaluated as fixed effect in the model. Change in dGEMRIC index was statistically significantly related
to side (P < 0.001), but not to treatment (P = 0.8002), but the interaction term indicated that the effect of treatment may be modified by side (P =
0.09). So, effects per subgroup (HTO lateral/HTO medial/KJD lateral/KJD medial) were estimated in the model.

cA statistically significant effect for side of the knee was found (P < 0.001). Evaluating modification of the association between JSW change and
dGEMRIC change by side in the regression model also indicated that effect modification may be present (regression coefficient: 14.62, P = 0.20), thus
all further analyses were stratified by side. Hereafter, modification of the association between JSW change with dGEMRIC change by treatment was
evaluated (regression coefficient of -30.57, P = 0.03), justifying additional stratification by treatment.
dA statistically significant effect for side of the knee (P < 0.001) and treatment (P < 0.001) was found. Evidence for modification of the association
between change in WOMAC and dGEMRIC change by side or by treatment was not found (WOMAC * side: P = 0.71, and WOMAC * treatment: P =
0.42), thus the group was not stratified for treatment and/or side.

GAG content at the lateral compartment after HTO and
decrease at the medial compartment might be the result of
wedging of the joint after HTO, resulting in a slight lateral
compression and a slight medial decompression, and with
that relative (apparent) change in GAG signal. This is sup-
ported by a study demonstrating the sensitivity of dGEMRIC
values to cartilage compression and unloading.33 Change in
dGEMRIC indices are, on average, all quite small, represent-
ing relative small changes in cartilage quality over 2 years.
The assumption of compression of the lateral compartment is
however not supported by the observation that a significant
relation between a decrease in lateral JSW and a decrease in
cartilage quality (dGEMRIC indices) was found in specifi-
cally the lateral compartment of HTO patients. This positive
association between change in JSW and change in dGEM-
RIC signal in specifically the lateral compartment indicates
that in case of an increasing lateral joint space width, despite
wedging of the whole joint, quality of cartilage (higher
dGEMRIC score) improves in these cases, over 2 years. So,
this might represent actual improvement of quality accompa-
nying an increase in JSW. However, the fact that this is only
found in the lateral compartment on only HTO treatment and
that absolute changes are small argues its relevance.
No statistically significant relation between structural
change and dGEMRIC change in KJD patients was found.
dGEMRIC values are expected to improve only if cartilage
damage is at the early stage, whereas if the collagen structure
is already compromised, a replenishment of GAGs becomes
more difficult, which could explain the statistically signifi-
cant influence of baseline dGEMRIC values on the change
over time. The lack of statistically significant or consistent
change in dGEMRIC values for KJD, together with the clear
increase in JSW, suggests that the tissue quality in KJD
patients, on average, including the newly formed, is main-
tained. It might be argued whether this quality is sufficient, as
baseline values are obtained from presumably impaired carti-
lage tissue in a severely damaged OA joint. Unfortunately,
the dGEMRIC signal of the baseline condition of the treated
joints was not compared with the contralateral healthy joint.
Since dGEMRIC values are expected to decrease over time
in damaged joints, although no data are available, the mainte-
nance of cartilage quality over time could be considered a
positive finding. KJD and HTO may have been useful in
stopping further cartilage degeneration, indicated by minor
or absent changes in dGEMRIC indices. The question
remains whether there is an increase in cartilage quality of
the residual tissue with newly formed tissue of inferior qual-
ity, whether the new tissue is of similar quality as the residual
unchanged tissue, or whether it is residual cartilage tissue
that has decompressed and thereby showed an apparent
decrease in quality (lower GAG content per volume).
It was subjectively observed that cartilage quality in the
deeper layers (on to the bone) seemed to improve over two
years (representative image shown in Supplementary Figure
2). In the original MRI KJD studies, it was demonstrated
that newly formed tissue is largely filling up denuded bone
areas, thus cartilaginous tissue is formed in the deep
layers.34 This is suggestive of newly formed quality tissue,
filling in denuded bone area's but is far from conclusive.
With regard to the dGEMRIC imaging technique; a
series of scans, acquired with different echo times, is neces-
sary to calculate dGEMRIC indices. Increased scanning
times increase the risk of patient motion in between
sequences (repositioning), potentially decreasing the effi-
cacy of the fitting. Repositioning effects in our study were
minimized by implementing image registration.35
Longitudinal evaluation of cartilage repair, such as repre-
sented in this explorative study, assume equal distribution
of gadolinium within the joint. Although our contrast proto-
col is very strict, variations are inevitable, amongst others
because of heterogeneous uptake of gadolinium in repair
tissue over time, influenced not only by GAG content but
also patient motion, water content, and permeability of
tissue.36,37 Note that it takes also quite some time for the
contrast to distribute throughout the body. This variation
may add to the inability to detect small changes over time.
GAG concentration is, given its substantial contribution
to load-bearing, a good measure to distinguish healthy from
degenerated tissue.22 However, studies have shown that
some results cannot be explained by GAG measurements
alone, but might be found in a combination of several quan-
titative MRI techniques, morphological, and clinical evalu-
ation.22,38 dGEMRIC is considered a valuable tool in
evaluating cartilage quality, but there are also alternative
MRI techniques available to assess cartilage quality, such as
sodium MRI, T1 rho, and T2-mapping.22
All limitations of dGEMRIC imaging considered in gen-
eral and in this specific small size study, implementation of
a strict contrast administration protocol, minimized patient
motion during acquisition, postprocessing image registra-
tion, and minimal variation between observers should be
sufficient to consider dGEMRIC indices as representative
for cartilage quality with respect to GAG content/distribu-
tion in this study. Assuming this, despite the limited number
of patients, it might be concluded that cartilaginous repair
on HTO and KJD is not accompanied by further decrease in
GAG content. Future studies powered to elucidate potential
differences between HTO and KJD treatment on dGEMRIC
indices should be performed to support current findings and
provide conclusive answers.
Summarizing, the significant clinical benefit and increase
in radiographic JSW 1 year after treatment of medial com-
partmental OA by either HTO or KJD, maintains through-
out the second year of follow-up, postponing the natural OA
progression rate and with that knee arthroplasty. There
seems to be a clinically relevant relation between the
increase in cartilage quality as determined by dGEMRIC
and patients' experienced clinical benefit determined by
12 Cartilage 00(0)
WOMAC. Assuming natural deterioration of the cartilage
tissue seen in osteoarthritis patients, is reflected in loss of
GAG and therefore also applies to a decrease in dGEMRIC
indices, KJD and HTO may contribute to regeneration of
cartilaginous tissue with maintenance of cartilage quality,
and thereby delaying the degeneration process.
