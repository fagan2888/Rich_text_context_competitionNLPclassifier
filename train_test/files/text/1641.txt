Introduction
Considerable effort is currently being invested in identifying
predictors of body weight. Social characteristics are of spe-
cial interest because they have the potential to readily identify
those at risk of obesity, some can be modified, and they may
offer ways to target overweight individuals and assist them in
weight management. Although many sociocultural aspects of
obesity have been analyzed (1), one characteristic that has not
been well examined is marital status.
Among studies that explicitly examine marital status and
body weight, cross-sectional investigations tend to find that
married people are heavier (2,3), although this finding is not
consistent for all investigations and may vary for some marital
categories like widowhood (4) and be contingent upon other
characteristics like gender (5,6). Longitudinal analyses tend to
find that marital entry is associated with weight gain and mari-
tal exit is associated with weight loss (7­13), although these
patterns also vary between studies and are sometimes condi-
tional upon other variables like gender (14,15).
The mixed patterns of past studies suggest a need to fur-
ther examine how and under what conditions marriage and
body weight are related. Marriage may be associated with body
weight in many ways, both through social selection of indi-
viduals into and out of marital states because of their weight,
and through social causation where particular marital states
influence body weight (16). Body weight is influenced by inter-
actions between dietary intake, physical activity, smoking, and
other factors that are embedded within marital relationships.
Marriage has been changing historically, with a retreat from
the institution of marriage evidenced by rising deferral of
age at first marriages, increased cohabitation without marry-
ing, higher dissolution of marriage through separation and
divorce, and more frequent lifelong nonentry into marriage
(17). These changing dynamics of marriage vary among differ-
ent subgroups in society.
In particular, the role of ethnicity in marriage­weight rela-
tionships deserves special attention because consistent differ-
ences occur between ethnic groups in marital patterns and
processes (18) and body weight and the prevalence of obesity
(19,20). Blacks in the United States appear to have retreated
from marriage more than other ethnic groups (21,22). In con-
trast, Hispanics tend to exhibit higher desire to marry and
greater commitment to marriage, and therefore have retreated
less from marriage (23,24). Ethnicity also is associated with
body weight, with white Americans tending to be thinner
than black Americans, and average body weights of Hispanic
Americans tending to be situated between those two ethnic
groups (19,25).
Gender also is strongly related to body weight (26), with body
weight differently experienced by men and women (1). Weight
patterns are conditional upon gender for some ethnic groups
(27), particularly among black Americans where women tend
to be heavier and men lighter (19,25).
It is currently unclear how ethnic groups vary in mar-
riage­weight relationships for men and women. Some prior
analyses of marriage and weight have not reported about the

and Body Weight in the United States

Married individuals tend to be heavier than those who are unmarried, particularly men, and individuals in different
ethnic categories vary in their involvement in marriage and in their body weights. We examined gender and ethnic
differences in relationships between marital status and body weight using cross-sectional data from the 1999­2002
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 3,947 women and 4,019 men. The findings revealed
that compared to married men in the same ethnic category, white divorced men, black never-married men, and all
Hispanic men except for widows had lower odds of being overweight. Compared to married women in the same ethnic
category, white women's weights did not significantly differ by marital status, black separated women had greater
odds of being overweight, and Hispanic never-married women had lower odds of being overweight. Associations of
marriage with body weight appear to be at least partly contingent upon gender and ethnicity, which may reflect larger
societal patterns of involvement in marriage, commitment to family, and body-weight norms and expectations.

ethnicity of the sample (9), excluded some ethnic minorities
from analysis (27), or controlled for ethnicity in multivari-
ate models (10). Two studies compared marriage­weight
relationships for different ethnic groups, and found simi-
lar patterns for blacks, Hispanics, and whites (12,13). These
studies, however, only examined young adults, used self-
reported body weight, and did not consider widowhood as
a marital category.
This investigation examined gender and ethnic patterns in
relationships between six categories of marital status (includ-
ing cohabitation, separation, and widowhood) and body
weight for adults of all ages. The analysis is further strength-
ened by the use of measured (rather than self-reported) height
and weight, and by the use of dietary intake, physical activity,
and cigarette smoking as potential mediating mechanisms in
marriage­weight relationships.
Overall, we hypothesize that married individuals will be at
greater risk for overweight than their unmarried counterparts.
The risk of overweight among never-married men and women,
and those who exited a marriage through separation or divorce
are expected to be equivalent. Widows, on the other hand,
experience a unique and often sudden marital exit and are
expected to have risk for overweight that mirrors their married
counterparts. In contrast to overweight, we hypothesize that
the more extreme body weight measure of obesity is unrelated
to marital status.
We further expect that overall marriage­weight relation-
ships are contingent upon ethnicity and gender. Among
white men and black men, the overall patterns are expected
to hold. Among Hispanic men, who have high commitment
to marriage and value marital longevity, risk of overweight
and obesity is expected to be higher among the married men
and widowers than in all other marital categories. Among
white women, who tend to be more concerned with thinness
than either men or women of other ethnicities, the risk for
overweight is expected to be greater among married women
than among never 
married and divorced women who may be
actively seeking marital partners. Among black women, who
experience greater cultural acceptance of varying body images,
risk of overweight and obesity is expected to be independent of
marital status. Patterns among Hispanic women are expected
to mirror those of Hispanic men.
Methods And Procedures
Data, design, and sample
Data were drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), which collected questionnaire and medical exami-
nation data from noninstitutionalized civilian residents of the United
States from 1999 to 2002 (28). The project was approved by the Cornell
University Institutional Review Board. The design was cross-sectional,
with each of the four annual survey years pooled into one analyti-
cal data set to obtain sufficient numbers of individuals for subgroup
analysis (29). In all, 22% of sampled individuals were excluded because
they did not complete the medical exam (n = 820), were women who
were pregnant or for whom pregnancy was uncertain (n = 582), had
unknown marital status (n = 441), did not have reported dietary data
(n = 418), or had no measured or reported height and weight (n = 19).
This produced an analytical sample of 7,966 adults aged 20.
NHANES used a complex multistage probability sampling procedure.
Variance corrections for the complex sample design were performed
using masked strata and pseudo primary sampling units provided by
The National Center for Health Statistics with the SPSS Complex Samples
module. Data were weighted using National Center for Health Statistics
sample weights calculated to adjust for over-sampling of low income,
African American, and Mexican American individuals, and those over
60 years old.
Measures
Marital status was treated as the independent variable and was cat-
egorized as never married, cohabiting, married, separated, divorced,
or widowed. Body weight was treated as the dependent variable, and
was measured by trained personnel using regularly calibrated scales.
Height was also measured, and used with weight to calculate a BMI of
kg/m2 to indicate stored body fat levels beyond the weight of lean skel-
etal, muscle, or organ tissues (30). Measured weights and heights were
highly correlated with self-reported weights (r = 0.97) and heights
(r = 0.93) in this NHANES data, so self-reported measures were used
for 335 individuals for whom measured weight or height was not
available. BMI subsequently was categorized to produce indicators of
being overweight (BMI >25) or obese (BMI >30) (see ref. 31).
Gender was a stratifying variable for all analyses because of the differ-
ent ways that men and women experience and are affected by marriage
(32) and the different ways each gender perceives body weight (26). There
were 4,019 men and 3,947 women in the analytical sample.
Ethnicity was used as a stratifying variable for some analyses to com-
pare the marriage­weight relationship within and between three major
United States ethnic groups. Ethnicity was self-reported by the partici-
pants in separate questions about ethnicity and race that were used by
The National Center for Health Statistics to establish four categories to
conduct ethnic comparisons: white nonHispanic, black 
nonHispanic,
Mexican American, and other Hispanic. We combined Mexican

Americans and other Hispanics into one Hispanic group to provide
sufficient sample sizes for adequate comparisons. There were insuffi-
cient numbers of study participants in other ethnic groups available to
permit explicit stratification by additional ethnic categories. Respond-
ents reporting multiple or mixed ethnicities were coded with the "other"
category and excluded from ethnic subgroup analyses to create a clear
comparison of white, black, and Hispanic ethnic categories.
Sociodemographic control variables included four characteristics
of individuals that may confound the marriage­weight relationship.
Age is directly related with body weight (1) and was self-reported in
years, with individuals older than age 85 coded as 85. Age squared
was also included in multiple regression models to adjust for possible
curvilinear relationships as height and weight decline slightly among
older adults (4). Socioeconomic status is inversely associated with
body weight, particularly among women (1). Education was reported
in the three categories of less than high school, high school graduate
or equivalent certification, and more than high school. Family income
was self-reported in 11 categories where the lowest was $0­4,999 and
the highest was $75,000.
Biological childbearing is associated with higher body weights among
women (33) and a fertility variable was constructed for female respond-
ents. Women reporting one or more live births were considered child-
bearers, whereas those reporting not yet menstruating, never having
been pregnant, or never having a live birth were considered not to be
childbearers, although information for this variable was missing for 225
women (6%). Adequate correlates were not available for imputing miss-
ing values for childbearing, and inclusion of this variable made no sub-
stantial difference in multivariate models, so therefore childbearing was
not included in the final analyses.
Behavioral control variables included three key types of potential
mediators for the marriage­weight relationship. Dietary intake was
assessed using a 24-h recall procedure (30). From this assessment,
energy intake from foods consumed was calculated. Three dietary vari-
ables were analyzed here: (i) total daily energy intake, (ii) percentage
obesity | VOLUME 17 NUMBER 12 | december 2009 2225

Epidemiology
of energy from carbohydrates, and (iii) percentage of energy from fat.
Physical activity represents energy output and was assessed as (i) a
usual physical activity rating in four categories from 1.4 to 1.8 metabolic
equivalents (34), (ii) a 30 day recall of leisure-time physical activity we
coded as either no leisure physical activity or some leisure physical
activity, and (iii) daily hours of nonwork time reported as spent view-
ing television or videos or at a computer screen, that we coded from 0
to 5 or more. Additionally, smoking was self-reported and participants
were coded as smokers if they smoked one or more days during the
past 30 days.
Missing values were imputed for income (10% missing), education
(0.1%), physical activity (0.1%), television/computer use (0.1%), and
smoking (0.1%) using an expectation-maximization procedure per-
formed separately for men and women (35).
Data analyses
All analyses were stratified by gender, and some analyses were
stratified by ethnic group. First, descriptive information about
all variables was examined, with 2 and ANOVA tests performed
to identify statistically significant differences across marital cat-
egories. Second, bivariate logistic regression analyses were used to
examine the relationship between marital status and body weight
not adjusted for confounding or mediating variables. Third, mul-
tivariate logistic regressions were performed to control for blocks
of confounding and then mediating variables in the total sample.
Fourth, multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusting for other
demographics were performed for whites, blacks and Hispanic
respondents separately. Fifth, multivariate logistic regression

models which also included interactions between ethnic group and
marital status were examined for the three ethnic groups combined.
Each marital category was compared to married individuals as a
reference group, and for interaction effects married whites were the
reference group.
Results
Descriptive analyses for men and women showed that the
weighted data were similar to national patterns of adults,
with respondents being mostly white, married, middle-
aged, high-school educated, moderate income individuals
(Table 1). Weight-category data revealed that the majority of
respondents were overweight. Their mean reported energy
intake was approximately equivalent to national averages,
with approximately half of energy intake from carbohydrates
and a third from fat. Most individuals in the sample were
somewhat active, engaged in leisure time physical activity,
watched television several hours per day, and did not smoke.
Nearly every measured demographic and health behavior

differed significantly across marital categories for both men
and women. Among married respondents, there were few
blacks (6% of men and women) mirroring the national retreat
from marriage among blacks, whereas blacks were most
prevalent in the separated marital category. The economic
advantages of married individuals were apparent, with more
education (55% of married men and 30% of married women
had more than a high school education) and higher family
incomes (29% of married men and 30% of married women
had incomes >$75,000).
Never-married men and women had notably different health
behaviors than individuals in other marital categories. They
consumed the most energy (almost 2,750 kcal for men and
2,045 kcal for women, on average); and 70% of never-mar-
ried men and 66% of never-married women engaged in some
form of leisure time physical activity. Never-married men also
had the most screen time (2.7h on average). Among women,

widows had the most screen time (2.9h on average).
Body weight also differed across marital categories, with
married men being the most likely to be overweight (74%) or
obese (30%). Among women, the separated marital category
was most likely to be overweight (75%) or obese (43%).
Multivariate analyses of overweight and obesity by marital
categories, adjusting for demographic characteristics revealed
differentpatternsformenandwomen(Table2).Nevermarried,
separated, and divorced men had significantly lower odds of
being overweight than men who were married. Only divorced
men had significantly lower odds of being obese compared to
married men. Controlling for diet, physical activity, and smok-
ing behaviors did not change this pattern of relationships.
Among women, there were no significant relationships
between marital status and overweight after adjusting for
demographic characteristics. Including health behaviors did
not alter this result. Obesity among women did vary by marital
category, with cohabiting and divorced women less likely to be
obese than married women only when demographic charac-
teristics were included in the regression model. The addition
of health behaviors to this regression model attenuated these
significant results, and marital category was no longer associ-
ated with obesity. Overall, this table suggests that mediating
behaviors explained little of marriage­weight relationships
among men and women and further regression models here
include only adjustment for the demographic characteristics
of respondents.
Ethnic differences in body weights differed by gender. For
men, body weight did not differ significantly by ethnic group,
even after controlling for other demographic characteristics
(data not shown). Among women, however, large differences
were observed across ethnic groups. After controlling for other
demographic characteristics, black women had approximately
twice the odds of being overweight (odds ratio (OR) = 2.26,
P < 0.01) or obese (OR = 1.91, P < 0.01) compared to white
women. Hispanic women also had greater odds of being over-
weight compared to white women (OR = 1.66, P < 0.01), with
no significant difference in obesity.
Distinct relationships existed between marital status and both
overweight and obesity within ethnic groups (Table 3). White
men who were divorced had about half the odds of being over-
weight or obese as married white men. Black men who were
never married had about half the odds of being overweight as
married black men, but no significant differences in obesity by
marital status existed for black men. Hispanic men who were
never married, cohabiting, separated, or divorced all had lower
odds of being overweight than married Hispanic men. For
obesity among Hispanic men, divorced and widowed individu-
als were significantly less likely to be obese than married men.
Among white women there were no significant marital

status differences for overweight, and the only significant
difference for obesity was that white women living with a
partner had about half the odds of obesity as did married
white women. For black women, the only significant marital

status difference was that separated black women had over
twice the odds of being overweight as married black women.
Never-married Hispanic women had lower odds of being
overweight than married Hispanic women, and divorced
Hispanic women had significantly lower odds of being obese
than married Hispanic women.
Multivariate regressions for the three ethnic groups com-
bined, including interactions between marital status and eth-
nicity, revealed significant differences between the patterns of
marriage­body weight relationships for each ethnicity. For men,
never-married black and Hispanic men were less likely to be
overweight than their married ethnic counterparts, which was
statistically different (P < 0.10) than the pattern of relation-
ships observed for white men (where never married and mar-
ried white men were equally likely to be overweight). Although
the odds of obesity among Hispanic cohabiting men (compared
to Hispanic married men) did not reach statistical significance
(OR = 1.71, P = 0.10), this relationship was significantly different
(P < 0.10) than the relationship observed for cohabiting white
men compared to married white men (OR = 0.65, P = 0.24).
For women, although never-married Hispanic women were
significantly less likely to be overweight than married Hispanic
women, this relationship was statistically different than the
pattern for never married and married white women who
were equally likely to be overweight. Although the nominally
greater odds of overweight for Hispanic women living with a
partner compared to married Hispanic women did not achieve
statistical significance (OR = 1.48, P = 0.16), it was statistically
different (P < 0.10) from results observed among white women,
who showed nominally lesser odds of being overweight (OR =
0.76, P = 0.17).
Discussion
This investigation went beyond previous research about gender,
ethnicity, marriage, and weight (12,13) by explicitly examining
ethnic differences and the interactions between marital status
and ethnicity for a full scope of marital categories and a sam-
ple that included a broad range of ages. This study found that
marital status was related to weight and that relationship dif-
fered by gender and ethnicity. These findings for men support
the overall hypothesis that married people are heavier, which is
congruent with prior studies about marriage and weight (2,3).
Among women, however, no overall difference existed by mar-
ital status after controlling for other variables.
These analyses further reveal a diversity of relationships
between marriage and weight when ethnicity is considered.
Among whites, divorced men have lower odds of being over-
weight or obese than married men. In contrast, white women's
weights did not differ by marital status, which is consistent with
the tendency for weight norms to apply to all women (22).
Overall, black women had higher prevalence of overweight
than white women. Black women tend to have more accepting
body image and are not as invested in thinness as white women
(36). Among black women, however, it is notable that sepa-
rated women were more than twice as likely to be overweight
than those who were married. Unstable marital relationships

Married is the reference marital category, and white is the reference ethnicity. Among white married men, 75% are overweight and 31% are obese. Among black 
married
men, 72% are overweight and 29% are obese. Among hispanic married men, 79% are overweight and 26% are obese. Among white married women, 58% are over-
weight and 32% are obese. Among black married women, 79% are overweight and 49% are obese. Among hispanic married women, 74% are overweight and 39% are
obese. Regression models for each ethnic subgroup include marital status, ethnicity, age, age squared, education, and income. The statistical significance of interactions
between marital status and ethnicity were tested with the full sample including all the variables listed above plus indicators for black and Hispanic and their interactions
with marital status.

and economic hardship are particularly problematic for black
women (18) and may contribute to this higher prevalence of
overweight. Separated black women withdrawing from mar-
riage may not seek thinness because they are not interested in
pursuing other relationships, they face a discouraging mar-
riage market (37), or because cultural expectations of poten-
tial marriage partners do not include thinness. If this was
the case, however, we would expect all categories of unmar-
ried black women to have similarly higher body weight than
married black women and this is not what was observed in
these data. The economic hardship of being a separated black
woman may be a more relevant explanation of the higher body
weights observed here. Other research has noted that resource
differences do not explain away weight differences (38), and
we controlled for two indicators of socioeconomic status in
this analysis. Food insecurity, however, has been shown to be
related to disordered eating and to overweight among women
(39,40). Food insecurity can lead women to have restricted
intake when food is scarce and then to overeat when food is
more plentiful, resulting in weight gain.
Never-married Hispanic and black men were lighter than
their married ethnic counterparts, even after controlling for all
other demographic characteristics. This pattern of results was
significantly different among whites where the never married
and married were equally likely to be overweight or obese. This
suggests that the striking differences among Hispanic and black
respondents may drive the overall theme in the literature that
married men are heavier than their unmarried counterparts.
It is notable that married Hispanic men had considerably
higher odds of being overweight than all other Hispanic mari-
tal categories, except widows. Hispanic men tend to exhibit
greater desire to marry, more marital involvement, and greater
commitment to family than other ethnic groups (23,24).
Married Hispanic men may engage in more regular and more
extensive family eating and sedentary family activities than
their unmarried counterparts. Married Hispanic men may eat
greater amounts of food more regularly in family meals and
forego individualistic or away-from-home recreational physi-
cal activity (41). Hispanic widowers may continue to eat in this
familial context, given the nature of their marital exit.
These results show the relevance of considering the complex-
ity of interacting and contingent relationships between gender,
ethnicity, marriage, and body weight. Ethnic cultural differ-
ences may be involved at many levels. Ethnic and marital dif-
ferences in body image may underlie some of these observed
relationships, particularly among women who tend to be more
concerned about body image than are men (42). For example,
whites and never-married individuals have greater concerns
and more stringent standards about body weight than those
with other ethnic and marital identities (43).

ing produced few additional changes in marriage­weight

relationships beyond adjusting for socio-demographics. This
does not mean that energy intake, physical activity, and smok-
ing are not involved in the establishment and regulation of
body weight, but rather that their influence is independent of
the relationships that we observed between marriage and body
weight. Furthermore, these physiological mechanisms may not
have been adequately assessed by the NHANES survey. Diet
and activity data in epidemiological analysis are often incom-
plete and prone to measurement error (34). Duration and
amount of smoking differs between gender and ethnic groups
(44), and the multifaceted aspects of tobacco use are difficult to
fully examine. Adequate modeling of the roles of health behav-
iors in marriage­weight relationships may require data with
additional measures and greater depth of assessment in larger
samples with greater numbers of people in all ethnic groups.
Severallimitationsofthisstudydeservenote.First,Although
the sample is broadly representative of the United States
population, it omits institutionalized individuals, those who
refused to participate, and excluded cases due to missing data,
which may vary across ethnic groups and influence observed
marital differences. The sample included thousands of indi-
viduals, but some marital-ethnic subgroups had relatively few
cases, which limited our analysis of ethnicity to white, black
and Hispanic respondents.
Second, the design was cross-sectional, which did not per-
mit clear consideration of the extent to which marital status
influenced weight, weight influenced marital status, or both.
Whereas NHANES is unique among large public data sets in
including dietary data, cross-sectional assessment of diet at
one point in time does not necessarily relate to body weight
levels that may have been established through long-term die-
tary, activity, and smoking patterns.
Third, there were measurement limitations in the data.
Although our analysis controlled for several key demographic
variables, the observed relationships may be influenced by
or contingent upon other variables that were not available in
NHANES like neighborhood environments or family meal
patterns. BMI, even when calculated from measured height
and weight, is an imperfect measure of body fat stores and its
accuracy may vary between ethnic groups (45). Also, multiple
marriages and duration of partnerships may offer additional
insights beyond current marital status, but were not available
in the NHANES survey.
These findings show that overweight was more prevalent
among married Hispanic men compared to other Hispanic
men, and among separated black women compared to other
black women. Programs to manage body weight may benefit
from tailoring interventions to specific gender-ethnic-marital
subgroups. For example, interventions designed to serve mar-
ried Hispanic men might capitalize on their commitment to
marriage and family and include premarital diet and weight
education, emphasize controlled food portions at family meals,
or use a couples weight management model. Additionally,
interventions for separated black women might focus on main-
taining regular eating patterns, identifying sources of social
support after separation, and seeking opportunities to be more
active in everyday tasks. To effectively address high prevalence
of overweight among separated black women, however, may
require improved economic conditions or better food security,
which would require broader economic or policy shifts rather
than interventions with individuals.
