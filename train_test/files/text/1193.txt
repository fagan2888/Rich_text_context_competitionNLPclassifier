Abstract The present study used a prospective,
longitudinal design to investigate genetic and environ-
mental influences on the association between earlier
conduct problems and the initiation and progression of
marijuana use during adolescence. Parent- and tea-
cher-reported conduct problems assessed at Time 1
(1996) and self-reported marijuana use assessed at
Time 2 (2004) were available for 1088 adolescent twin
pairs participating in the Cardiff Study of All Wales
and North West of England Twins (CaStANET).
Using a novel approach to the modeling of initiation
and progression dimensions in substance use, findings
suggested that the initiation of marijuana use in
adolescence was influenced by genetic, common and
unique environmental factors. The progression (or
frequency) of marijuana use was influenced by genetic
and unique environmental factors. Findings for con-
duct problems indicated that while the presence or
absence of conduct problems was largely heritable, the
relative severity of conduct problems appeared to be
more strongly environmentally influenced. Multivari-
ate model fitting indicated that conduct problems in
childhood and early adolescence made a small but
significant contribution to the risk for marijuana use
8 years later.

Marijuana use can pose a major risk to adolescent
health and well-being, yet it remains the most com-
monly used illicit drug in both the United States and
the United Kingdom. In the USA, both availability and
rates of marijuana use among adolescents increased
sharply during the 1990s, with only a slight decline in
recent years (Johnston et al. 2005). In the UK, there
was a gradual increase in adolescents reporting mar-
ijuana use in the past 12 months, from 10% in 1998 to
13% in 2003, with a slight decline in 2004 to 11%
(National Centre for Social Research 2005). In the
United States, 50% of adolescents reported the use of
marijuana by the age of 17 (Johnston et al. 2005) while
in the United Kingdom, 38% of 15­16 year olds had
used marijuana (Hibell et al. 2004). Marijuana use is
related to a range of deleterious outcomes including
lower academic achievement, criminality and mental
health problems such as depression and suicidal
behaviour (Fergusson et al. 2002; Penning and Barnes
1982; van den Bree and Pickworth 2005). Recent

research using a twin design has identified conduct
problems in childhood and adolescence as a major risk
factor for substance use, and marijuana use specifically
(e.g. Miles et al. 2002; Silberg et al. 2003; Young et al.
2000).
A series of studies have documented genetic and
environmental influences on adolescent marijuana use
(e.g. Maes et al. 1999; McGue et al. 2000; Miles et al.
2001). Given the complex processes thought to under-
lie the link between initiation and progression of drug
use however, it is argued that the question should not
be whether or not there is a genetic component to drug
use per se, but rather what role genetic influences play
in the aetiology of drug use over time (Rutter et al.
1999; e.g. Rhee et al. 2003). Recent research has
highlighted that the initiation and progression of
substances may not be characterised as a single liability
of risk (e.g. Agrawal et al. 2005; Heath et al. 1991, 1997;
Koopmans et al. 1999). Rather, the initiation and
progression phases of substance use may be more
appropriately characterised as partially overlapping (or
even, independent; Heath et al. 1991). Indeed, while
evidence from adult twin studies indicates that there
are additive genetic, common environmental and
unique environmental factors that are shared between
the initiation and progression of marijuana use, there is
also evidence of genetic and unique environmental
influences that are specific to heavier use of marijuana
(Agrawal et al. 2005). The increased influence of
genetic factors for heavy substance use possibly reflects
the increased involvement of biological processes in
chronic use (Kender 2001; van den Bree 2005).
For many individuals, initiation and experimenta-
tion with substances occurs during adolescence (Fuller
et al. 2005). Adolescents may however, have lower
tolerance levels for substances, including marijuana,
and become dependent at lower doses than adults (e.g.
Chen et al. 1997). Furthermore, adolescent-onset
substance misuse is characterized by more rapid
development of multiple drug dependencies and more
severe psychopathology (e.g. Clark et al. 1998). With
this in mind, it is important to consider the relative role
of genetic and environmental influences on initiation
and progression of substance use in this age group and
whether the relationship between these dimensions of
use identified with adult samples is also observed in
adolescents.
Antisocial behaviour during childhood and adoles-
cence has been linked to substance use in adolescence
and early adulthood (e.g. Moffitt et al. 2002; Silberg
et al. 2003). Moreover, in the context of other
disruptive behaviour disorders, conduct disorder has
been shown to be the most predictive of substance use
and illicit drug use (e.g. Lynskey and Fergusson 1995;
Moss and Lynch 2001). A recent follow-back study of a
prospective, longitudinal cohort found that adults with
a substance use disorder (alcoholism, marijuana and
other drug dependence) were significantly more likely
than those without such disorder to have had a conduct
and/or oppositional defiant disorder before 15-years
old (Kim-Cohen et al. 2003). Strong associations have
also been found between conduct disorder symptoms
and marijuana use in adolescence for both males and
females (Miles et al. 2002). This association was
moderately influenced by genetic factors and to a
lesser extent, by non-shared environmental factors (see
also Young et al. 2000). The findings of a recent
longitudinal twin study indicated that conduct prob-
lems in adolescence temporally preceded substance use
and that the covariation between conduct problems
and later substance use was influenced by genetic and
common environmental factors (Silberg et al. 2003).
These findings mark an important shift away from
documenting cross-sectional associations between con-
duct problems and substance use, from which it is
impossible to determine the direction of effects, toward
the use of genetically sensitive research designs that
assess relationships as they unfold over time. Indeed, in
the absence of an experimental design, a primary way
in which the nature of the relationship between
conduct problems and the initiation and progression
of marijuana use during adolescence can begin to be
disentangled is to use a prospective, longitudinal twin
design.
The present study is among the first to investigate
whether the initiation and progression of marijuana use
during adolescence reflects a common underlying
liability. Extending previous research on the relation-
ship between conduct problems and substance use, this
study also examines whether genetic and environmen-
tal influences on conduct problems are related to the
later initiation of marijuana use in adolescence and in
addition, whether conduct problems are implicated in
the continued use of marijuana once initiation has
occurred. Bivariate genetic analyses were conducted to
establish whether marijuana initiation and progression
represented a single liability of risk or alternatively,
whether these behaviours were more accurately rep-
resented as independent liabilities (see Fig. 1). It was
hypothesised that genetic, common and unique envi-
ronmental influences would contribute to the initiation
of marijuana use, consistent with the role of social
factors in the initial experimentation phase of drug use
(Rutter et al. 1999). In accordance with previous
studies (Agrawal et al. 2005; Kendler et al. 1999; van
den Bree et al. 1998) we hypothesized heavier use (i.e.
123
Behav Genet (2007) 37:314­325 315
the progression of marijuana use, rather than initia-
tion) to be more strongly influenced by genetic factors
with a reduced role for common environment. Multi-
variate analyses assessed the relationship between
conduct problems and later marijuana use. It was
hypothesised that earlier genetic and environmental
influences on conduct problems would be related to the
initiation of marijuana use 8 years later. Initiation of
marijuana use was expected to remain the strongest
predictor of progression of marijuana use after con-
trolling for the influence of conduct problems.
Method
Sample
The sample used in the present analyses was drawn
from the second (1996) and fourth wave (2004) of data
collection of the longitudinal Cardiff Study of All
Wales and North West of England Twins (CaStANET;
Rice et al. 2002; van den Bree et al. in press). The
CaStANET register is a population-based twin regis-
ter, including twins born between 1976 and 1991 in the
Cardiff area of South Wales and between 1980 and
1991 for the rest of Wales and the North West of
England. This twin register includes families from a
systematically ascertained, population-based register
of twin births between 1980 and 1991 in Wales and
Greater Manchester, UK. Zygosity was assigned using
a twin similarity questionnaire completed by parents
that is more than 90% accurate in distinguishing
monozygotic (MZ) from dizygotic (DZ) twins and, in
a subsample, validated by genotyping DNA markers
(Cohen et al. 1975; Nichols and Bilbro 1966; Payton
et al. 2001). The CaStANET study received ethical
approval from the Multi Centre Research Ethics
Committee for Wales, UK.
At the second wave of data collection (1996),
questionnaires were mailed to parents of twins aged
5­16 years old. Of 2846 families contacted, 2082
parents returned questionnaires, representing a re-
sponse rate of 73% (see Thapar et al. 2000 for a more
detailed description of the sample). Parental consent
was also obtained to contact the twins' teacher. Of
2168 teachers contacted, 1913 returned questionnaires,
representing a response rate of 88%. At the fourth
wave of data collection in 2004, questionnaires assess-
ing various aspects of family functioning, parent health
and twin psychological adjustment were mailed to
families (parents and twins) on the CaStANET twin
register with twins aged 11­19 years. Families were
sent a reminder postcard, reminder questionnaires and
finally, a reminder letter. Non-responding families who
might have moved address were traced through Gen-
eral Practitioners. Previous research has shown that
adolescent smokers and marijuana users are less likely
to respond at follow-up in longitudinal studies (Sidd-
iqui et al. 1996). Extra efforts were therefore made to
contact families via telephone where one twin had
reported substance use. Of 1755 families with adoles-
cent twins re-contacted in 2004, at least one family
member from 1214 families returned questionnaires
(1081 parents; 1125 twin pairs, where either or both
twins replied) representing a response rate of 69%.
Family members who returned questionnaires received
a high street store voucher as a token of appreciation
for their participation. Demographic statistics indi-
cated that the sample was representative of British
families living in the UK region of England and Wales
with regard to family constitution, ethnicity, employ-
ment and economic factors (Social Trends 2004).

The present study is based on a subsample of 1088
adolescent twin pairs with information relating to
conduct problems (parent and/or teacher report in
1996) and marijuana use in 2004. For clarity, these
assessments are referred to as Time 1 (1996) and Time
2 (2004), respectively from this point forward. Of this
sample, there was complete information for 895 twin
pairs. At Time 1 (1996), the sub-sample of twin pairs
were aged 5­13 years (mean = 9.02 years old;
SD = 1.98, range). At the Time 2 (2004), twin pairs
were aged 11­20 years old (mean = 16.10 years old;
SD = 1.94). There were approximately equal numbers
of participating boys (n = 960; 44.1%) and girls
(n = 1216; 55.9%). The sample comprised 425 mono-
zygotic twins (177 male, 248 female pairs) and 663
dizygotic twins (132 male, 189 female, 342 opposite sex
pairs). The majority of twins lived with their biological
mother and father (66.2%) with smaller proportions
living with one biological parent and a stepparent
(10.4%), a single parent (18.7%) and `other' (4.6%).
Twins classified as living with `other' included those
who were living with another relative (e.g. grandpar-
ents) and twins who lived apart or who were away at
university for part of the year. Analyses conducted in
which this last group were excluded resulted in a
similar pattern of findings to those reported below.
The majority of parent questionnaires (Time 1) were
completed by mothers (93.6%) with smaller numbers
completed by fathers (5.3%) and others (1.1% e.g.
stepparent; grandparent). There was no significant
difference in mean levels of conduct problems as a
function of the reporter of parent information. Tests
indicated that twins who did not respond at the Time 2
follow-up had higher levels of Time 1 conduct prob-
lems than twins who did respond (t = 4.809, P < 0.001).
This may indicate a possible bias, whereby adolescents
with higher conduct problems who were less likely to
respond at follow-up were also those adolescents more
likely to use substances, including marijuana.
Measures
Conduct problems
Parent and teacher-reported conduct problems were
assessed using five items from the Strengths and
Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman 1997; Goodman
and Scott 1999). Items included, `Often tells lies or
cheats' `Steals things', `Fights or bullies other children',
`Often has temper tantrums or hot tempers' and
`Generally obedient, usually does what adults request'
(recoded to reflect disobedient behaviour). Each item
was rated, 0 `Doesn't apply', 1 `Applies somewhat' or 2
`Certainly applies'. These items are broadly equivalent
to symptoms of conduct disorder as defined by the
DSM-IV (American Psychological Association 1994).
Parents and teachers reported on behaviour over the
last six months. Recent evidence indicates that differ-
ent informants provide related and unique information
about children's antisocial behaviour (Arseneault et al.
2003). Moreover, because children's behaviour can
vary between settings, the most valid measurement is
that which includes data from more than one informant
and from more than one setting or context (Scourfield
et al. 2004). Consistent with this argument, conduct
problem scores were combined for parent and teacher
reports by counting symptoms reported by either
parents or teachers as present, thereby capturing each
of the five behaviours occurring in both the home and
school context. The item-level correlations between
parent and teacher reports of conduct problems ranged
from r = 0.17 (stealing) to 0.56 (disobedience),
P < 0.001. The highest rating given by either parent
or teacher was taken as the score for that symptom, in
other words the occurrence of the behaviour in one
context (e.g. the home), was sufficient for it to be
counted as present. The internal consistency estimate
for the present sample was acceptable (a = 0.76) and
the five items were added to give a total conduct
problems score.
Using criteria outlined by Goodman (1997), conduct
problems ranging from 0 to 2 were classified as
`normal', a score of 3­4 was classified as `borderline'
and scores ranging from 5 to 10 were classified as
`abnormal'. Of respondents with conduct information
at Time 1, 585 (73%) monozygotic twins were classified
as normal, 154 (19%) as borderline and 67 (8%) as
abnormal. Of the dizygotic twins, 877 (69%) were
classified as normal, 227 (18%) as borderline and 166
(13%) as abnormal. Conduct problems were classified
on two dimensions: (1) the presence of conduct
problems was indexed as either `0' for `normal range'
or `1' for borderline or abnormal conduct problems (2)
the second dimension labelled `borderline/abnormal',
distinguished individuals in the borderline and abnor-
mal range for conduct problems. Children in the
normal range were coded as missing for borderline/
abnormal problems, borderline conduct problems was
coded as `0' and abnormal conduct problems were
coded `1'.
Marijuana use
The frequency of lifetime marijuana use was assessed
using the following item from the Add Health ques-
tionnaire (Resnick et al. 1997), `During your life, how
123
Behav Genet (2007) 37:314­325 317
many times have you used marijuana?' The six
response options ranged from `Never used marijuana
in my life' to `More than 30 times'. Responses were
collapsed to create two binary variables assessing
initiation of use and frequency of use. Initiation was
indexed as `0' for never having used marijuana and `1'
for use. Frequency was indexed as light and heavy use
with `0' representing use of marijuana 1­5 times and `1'
representing use of marijuana six or more times.
Individuals who had never used marijuana were coded
as missing for frequency of use.
Statistical analysis
The software package Mx (Neale 1997) was used for
genetic model fitting. Analyses were conducted using a
`causal common contingent' model which facilitates the
expression of marijuana use as a two-stage process
incorporating an initiation stage (`upstream', for exam-
ple whether the individual has ever tried marijuana)
that necessarily precedes a progression stage (`down-
stream', for example, whether the individual uses the
marijuana frequently; see Fig. 1; Agrawal et al. 2005;
Neale et al. 2006). The model estimates the magnitude
of the relationship between initiation and progression
by means of a beta pathway between these two stages
(see Fig. 1). If the beta coefficient is estimated to be
zero, this suggests that the initiation and progression
stages for a substance are entirely unrelated processes,
i.e. genetic and environmental risk factors for initiation
are completely independent from those for progres-
sion. Alternatively, if the beta coefficient is estimated
to be 1, this indicates that initiation and progression
are entirely overlapping dimensions with identical
genetic and environmental risk factors. The 95%
confidence intervals around the beta coefficient pro-
vide further information on the degree of overlap
between the two stages. Lower limits closer to zero (or
below) support independent liabilities and upper limits
approaching 1 provide support for identical liabilities.
The model also allows the estimation of: (1) additive
genetic effects (a2), (2) common environmental effects
(c2), and (3) unique environmental effects (e2), on both
initiation and progression of substance use.
An important feature of this model is that it is
uniquely suited to analysis of data from an adolescent
age group, where individuals may have not yet engaged
in marijuana use but will go on to become frequent
users. The model takes into account the fact that some
individuals may be above the liability threshold for
progression of marijuana use (i.e. will become frequent
users) but because they are not past the age of risk,
have not yet initiated marijuana use. As such, their
position on the liability distribution of progression is
unknown. These individuals are treated as a special
case of missing data for progression using the maxi-
mum likelihood approach for dealing with missing data
in Mx (Neale 1997; Neale et al. 2006). Given the
likelihood of an association between age and level of
substance use, an age correction was also employed
which adjusts the threshold for each twin according to
his or her age at the time of questionnaire completion
on the distribution of liability to conduct problems and
marijuana use. Specifically, the threshold is modeled as
a simple linear function:
ti
¼ t þ agei
ta
where t is the population baseline threshold (for
individuals of age zero), ta
models the regression of
the threshold on age, and agei
is the age in years of the
individual i at assessment (Neale et al. 2006).
Models were estimated using full information max-
imum likelihood (FIML) estimation with raw ordinal
data, which included zygosity, twin age, and initiation
and progression information relating to conduct prob-
lems and/or marijuana use for each twin. The signif-
icance of parameters was evaluated using 95%
confidence intervals (CIs), calculated using Mx (Neale
and Miller 1997).
Results
The rate of lifetime marijuana use for the total sample
of adolescents was 21.6%. Examining the prevalence of
marijuana use for younger and older adolescents
highlighted an age-related difference in levels of use.
Approximately 11% of 11­15 year olds had used
marijuana compared with 32.5% of adolescents
aged 16­20 years old. The average age of initiation
of marijuana use was 14 years (mean = 14.73,
SD = 1.67, range: 9­19 years). There was no difference
in the prevalence of marijuana use between MZ
(19.7%) and DZ twins (22.9%; v2 = 2.987, P = 0.084).
Tests indicated greater variance in marijuana use for
DZ twins compared to MZ twins (F = 4.220,
P = 0.040). A mean difference for a combined estimate
of parent and teacher-reported conduct problems
between MZ and DZ twins was also found (MZ,
mean = 1.68, SD = 1.92; DZ, mean = 1.89, SD = 2.13;
t = 2.27, P = 0.024). Tests revealed greater variation
around DZ conduct problems in comparison with MZ
twins (F = 9.938, P = 0.002). The higher DZ variances
for a parent and teacher rated measure of conduct
problems may indicate contrast effects whereby one
123
318 Behav Genet (2007) 37:314­325
twin is rated as having more behaviour problems than
the other twin. On the other hand, the greater
variances for DZ twin marijuana use may indicate
sibling interaction, for example where one twin is less
likely to engage in substance use in response to the
other twins' substance using behaviour. However, this
is somewhat counterintuitive because research indi-
cates that sibling deviance, and drug and alcohol use
specifically, predicts increased substance use (e.g.
Stormshak et al. 2004).
Tests of sex differences revealed no sex differences
in levels of marijuana initiation or progression (initi-
ation: males, mean = 0.22, SE = 0.01; females,
mean = 0.21, SE = 0.02; t = 0.55, P = 0.583; progres-
sion: males, mean = 0.32, SE = 0.03; females,
mean = 0.41, SE = 0.04; t = 1.75, P = 0.081) or for
the presence and severity of conduct problems (pres-
ence: males, mean = 0.29, SE = 0.02; females,
mean = 0.31, SE = 0.02; t = 0.78, P = 0.437; severity:
males, mean = 0.38, SE = 0.03; females, mean = 0.37,
SE = 0.03; t = 0.26, P = 0.792). All figures calculated
for pooled twin data were conducted using the survey
commands in STATA 9.0 (StataCorp 2005), appropri-
ate for use with twin data when there is non-indepen-
dence of observations. Preliminary analyses were also
conducted to investigate the relationship between a
continuously assessed index of conduct problems
(1996) and marijuana use (2004). The phenotypic
relationship between conduct problems and marijuana
use 8 years later was significant (b = 0.19, P < 0.01,
R2 = 0.09). The magnitude of association between
conduct problems and marijuana use for dizygotic
twins and monozygotic twins was similar, suggesting
common environmental influence (MZ twins, r = 0.18;
DZ twins, r = 0.19). Examining the tetrachoric corre-
lations using PRELIS 2.50 (Joreskog and Sorbom
1996) for each of the four constructs (initiation and
progression of conduct problems and marijuana use,
respectively) suggested genetic and shared environ-
mental influence. The correlations for presence of
conduct problems correlations were r = 0.77 for MZ
twins and 0.46 for DZ twins indicating genetic and
environmental influence, while the correlations for the
borderline/abnormal conduct problems construct were
r = 0.21 for MZ twins and 0.30 for DZ twins, indicating
stronger environmental influence. The results for
initiation of marijuana use indicated genetic and
shared environmental effects (MZ r = 0.80; DZ
r = 0.70), while progression of marijuana use appeared
to be more strongly genetically influenced (MZ
r = 0.68; DZ r = 0.13).
The relationship between the liability to initiation
and progression of conduct problems and marijuana
use
The results of model tests for conduct problems and
marijuana use, respectively, are presented in Table 1.
Conduct problems
To facilitate later multivariate tests of the relationship
between earlier conduct problems (Time 1) and later
marijuana use (Time 2), a CCC model was estimated
for conduct problems. Given the differences found
between MZ and DZ twins in levels of conduct
problems, model tests were conducted in which thresh-
olds for the different twin groups were allowed to vary.
This provided a better fit to the data than a model in
which thresholds were estimated to be the same
between twin groups and these results are reported
(v2 = 7.853, df = 2, P < 0.05). Substantively however,
the pattern of results was the same. The liability to any
conduct problems accounted for a large proportion, but
not all, of the variance in the liability to be classified as
borderline/abnormal for conduct problems (b = 0.74;
CI = 0.22, 0.95). The presence of conduct problems was
mainly influenced by genetic (69%) and non-shared
environmental factors (22%). Borderline/abnormal
conduct problems were influenced by common envi-
ronmental (27%) and non-shared environmental (73%)
factors. The threshold estimates were 0.47 for presence

and 1.10 for severity. A comparison of goodness-of-fit
indices indicated that modelling thresholds as a func-
tion of age did not significantly improve the fit of the
model (v2 = 4.302, df = 2, P > 0.10).
Marijuana use
The results for marijuana use indicated that the
initiation of use was explained by a heritable compo-
nent (35%), common environment (47%) and non-
shared environment (18%). In contrast, the frequency
of marijuana use was explained by a heritable compo-
nent (64%) and a non-shared environment component
(36%). The threshold estimates were 0.57 for initiation
and 1.17 for frequency. The beta value (b = 0.88;
CI = 0.38, 0.99) represents the genetic and environ-
mental influences on initiation that are, in turn,
transmitted to the frequency of marijuana use. This
value, which is less than unity, indicated that while the
liabilities for the initiation and frequency of marijuana
use were not independent, neither could these dimen-
sions be assumed to reflect a single liability of risk. In
other words, the liability to initiate use of marijuana
accounted for a substantial proportion (approximately
77%), but not all, of the variance in the liability to
more frequent use of marijuana. The CI's around beta
(0.38­0.99) further indicated that the two liabilities
were moderately to strongly related but not identical.
Goodness-of-fit statistics indicated that a model in
which age-corrected thresholds were estimated
provided a better fit to the data than a model that
did not include age-corrected estimates (v2 = 56.155,
df = 2, P < 0.001), corroborating our findings of a
higher prevalence of increased marijuana use in older
adolescents.
Multivariate analyses
Analyses were conducted to examine whether the
liability to conduct problems during childhood and
early adolescence was a risk factor for the liability to
initiate and use marijuana 8 years later. The model
was again estimated using full information maximum
likelihood (FIML) estimation with raw ordinal data,
which included zygosity, twin age, and `initiation' and
`progression' information relating to conduct problems
and marijuana use for each twin. In addition to paths
estimated from each initiation variable to the progres-
sion variable, paths were estimated from presence of
and borderline/abnormal conduct problems at Time 1
to marijuana initiation and progression at Time 2.
Figure 2 presents the results for the full model, in
which all six pathways between conduct problems
(Time 1) and marijuana use (Time 2) were estimated.
This model provided similar estimates of the relation-
ship between each classification of conduct problems
and the initiation and frequency of marijuana use,
respectively. Minor fluctuations were found between
models (bivariate model to the full multivariate
model) in the genetic and environmental estimates
for conduct problems, which can be expected to be a
result of the model estimation. Fixing estimates in the
full model to their bivariate values would not change
the substantive interpretation of the multivariate
results, nor would it yield a significant difference in
fit. However, the multivariate results should generally
be regarded as superior, because they use more
information.
The strongest beta-paths were observed within
traits, between initiation and progression variables
for both conduct problems and marijuana use. No
significant effects were observed between conduct
problems and later marijuana use (b range = 0.04­
0.17). In the context of strong effects from initiation to
frequency of marijuana use (b = 0.75), associations
between conduct problems and the frequency of
marijuana use were relatively weak. As the bivariate
analysis described above suggested however, there
were also relatively high levels of covariation in the
liabilities for presence and borderline/abnormal con-
duct problems. This may have affected the power of
either variable to predict initiation of marijuana use.
To investigate this possibility, nested models were
analysed to test the effect of dropping pathways
between initiation and progression constructs and
between conduct problems and marijuana use. Models
were fitted whereby the paths between liability to
conduct problems, severity of conduct problems,
liability to marijuana initiation and frequency of use
were dropped in turn and the deterioration in chi-
square fit compared to a model in which all possible
path coefficients from Time 1 conduct problems to
Time 2 marijuana use were estimated (see Table 2 for
model fitting results). These results showed that when
the path from liability to conduct problems and
severity of conduct problems was dropped there was
a significant reduction in model fit, compared to a full
model. This was also the case when the path from
liability to marijuana initiation and frequency of use
was dropped. When the path from borderline/abnor-
mal conduct problems to initiation of marijuana use
was dropped, the pathway from presence of conduct
problems to the initiation of marijuana use became
statistically significant (b = 0.23, CI = 0.13, 0.33).
Likewise, when the path from presence of conduct
123
320 Behav Genet (2007) 37:314­325
problems to initiation of marijuana use was dropped,
the pathway from borderline/abnormal conduct prob-
lems to the initiation of marijuana use also became
statistically significant (b = 0.24, CI = 0.22, 0.35).
Inspecting the deterioration in model fit when each
of these two paths was dropped indicated that when
the pathway from presence of conduct problems to the
initiation of marijuana use was dropped, there was a
trend toward a significant reduction in model fit,
(v2 = 3.02, df = 1, P < 0.10). In contrast, when the
pathway from borderline/abnormal conduct problems
to the initiation of marijuana use was dropped, a
significant drop in model fit was not observed
(v2 = 0.17, df = 1, P > 0.10).

Discussion
This study is among the first to investigate the
relationship between the initiation and progression
dimensions of substance use with an adolescent twin
sample and highlights that the initiation and progres-
sion of marijuana use, although strongly related,
cannot be assumed to have a single liability of risk.
The findings of this study also provide insight into the
relationship between conduct problems and adolescent
substance use. Specifically, the results indicate that in a
UK sample, the longitudinal association between the
liability to conduct problems during childhood and
early adolescence and the liability to initiate and
progress marijuana use in adolescence and early
adulthood are not strongly related. Thus, other risk
factors and the mechanisms through which they exert
effects on the initiation and progression of marijuana
use in adolescence should also be investigated.
Consistent with previous research examining the
relationship between initiation and progression (or use
and abuse) of substances in adult populations, additive
genetic, common and non-shared environmental influ-
ences were found for initiation of marijuana while
factors specific to progression were influenced by
genetic and non-shared environment with no role for
common environment (e.g. Agrawal et al. 2005; Heath
et al. 1997; Kendler and Prescott 1998; Koopmans et al.
1999). These findings concur with the view that
genetically influenced biological mechanisms appear
to play a more important role in the aetiology of
problem use and substance dependence (Kendler et al.
1999; van den Bree 2005). Interestingly, when conduct
problems were introduced as predictors of marijuana
initiation and progression in the multivariate model,
there was a slight reduction in the genetic estimate and
an increase in the environmental influence. This was
particularly the case for initiation of marijuana use. It
is also interesting to note that while not independent,
the initiation and frequency of marijuana use, to some
degree, represent different liabilities of risk. Concep-
tually, this indicates that the use of marijuana by
adolescents does not always and inevitably lead to
more frequent use and that there may be different risk
factors underlying initiation and progression to more
frequent marijuana use. Studies into risk factors that
predispose individuals to continued use of marijuana
after first experimentation with the drug will be helpful
in increasing insight into which adolescents are at
greatest risk for problem use. For example, van den
Bree and Pickworth (2005) found that some risk factors
predict both initiation of experimental marijuana use
and progression to regular use, while others are specific
to each stage.
The results for conduct problems indicated that
while the presence or absence of conduct problems
were largely heritable, the relative severity of conduct
problems, categorised as `borderline' and `abnormal'
appeared to be more strongly environmentally influ-
enced. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of
greater measurement error at the upper end of the
distribution contributing to a large non-shared envi-
ronment estimate. The beta coefficient between the
two dimensions suggested that they mostly, but not
entirely overlap (b = 0.74; see Table 1), with wide 95%
CIs (0.22, 0.95). Conceptually and epidemiologically,
recent evidence (e.g. Pickles et al. 2001; van den Oord
et al. 2003) indicates that conduct problems may be
best regarded as a single liability of risk where there is
no demarcation between normality and psychopathol-
ogy (Rutter 2003). The categorization of conduct
problems into dichotomous variables may have af-
fected the power to predict later marijuana use.
Preliminary analyses indicated that conduct problems
assessed as a continuous variable predicted later
marijuana use, although the strength of association
was not large (b = 0.19; P < 0.01). Likewise, model
tests in which presence and severity of conduct
problems were assessed separately indicated small
but significant effects from conduct problems to the
initiation of marijuana use. Although the trend toward
a significant drop in model fit when the path from
severity of conduct problems to initiation of marijuana
use was removed suggests that it is the presence rather
than severity of conduct problems that is important in
the prediction of marijuana use initiation, this is
speculative and should be replicated in independent
samples of larger number. Moreover, it will be inter-
esting in the future (as these models become available)
to repeat these analyses including conduct problems as
a dimensional measure with a single liability. The
findings of the present study also suggest that this
modelling technique could be applied to questions
relating to the transition from symptoms to diagnosis,
particularly when longitudinal data are available to
examine this relationship over time (see Neale et al.
2006).
A limitation of the present study was that the results
of both the bivariate and multivariate model tests had
wide confidence intervals around the progression
variables (borderline/abnormal conduct problems and
frequency of marijuana use). These possibly reflect the
low frequencies of adolescents with high levels of
conduct problems and who had initiated marijuana use.
123
322 Behav Genet (2007) 37:314­325
For instance, preliminary analyses indicated that ado-
lescents who did not respond at Time 2 (2004) had
higher levels of conduct problems at Time 1 (1996).
Thus, the present analyses may represent a conserva-
tive estimate of the influence of conduct problems on
later initiation and progression of marijuana use. In
addition, heterogeneity in the relationship between
conduct problems and marijuana use as a function of
the wide age range of the sample, together with a
reliance on a single item to index marijuana use, may
have affected the power to detect an association. In
addition, in light of the strong relations between the
initiation and progression variables, the cross-trait
paths are relatively small and larger sample sizes than
we currently have available are needed to obtain more
conclusive nested model fitting results for the cross-
trait paths. Finally, it should be noted that while the
present study provides insights regarding the pheno-
typic relationship between conduct problems and the
initiation and progression of marijuana use in adoles-
cence together with sources of genetic and environ-
mental influence on each index of conduct problems
and marijuana use, it does not assess genetic and
environmental sources of covariance between these
behaviours (see Neale et al. 2006). In addition to
addressing the caveats outlined above therefore, an
important direction for further research is to assess
these influences.
Previous research found sex differences in the
prevalence of marijuana use (greater use among males;
Johnston et al. 2005) and in the genetic and environ-
mental influences on adolescent male and female
marijuana initiation (e.g. Rhee et al. 2003). Recent
research has also identified sex differences in the
pattern of relations between the severity of conduct
problems and the later initiation of marijuana use
(Pedersen et al. 2001). The binary nature of the study
variables together with the sample size did not permit
model tests incorporating sex differences. Neverthe-
less, an important direction for future research is to test
causal common contingent models for sex differences
in the pattern of relations between conduct problems
and marijuana use in an adolescent age group.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the present study
extends previous research by investigating longitudinal
relationships between conduct problems and marijuana
use during adolescence using a modelling approach that
enabled age appropriate adjustments to estimates of the
relationship between the initiation and progression
dimensions of substance use. The findings are also
consistent with previous research indicating stronger
associations between conduct problems and substance
use within than across-time (e.g. Miles et al. 2002;
Silberg et al. 2003). As such, they suggest that interven-
tions aimed at helping children with conduct problems
in the years preceding the onset of substance use are
unlikely to reduce the risk of marijuana use in adoles-
cence and young adulthood. Other risk factors need to
be investigated. An important direction for future
research will be to develop models that can test these
processes with greater precision. For example, models
are required that permit the testing of risk factors
assessed using continuous measures as predictors of
initiation and progression of substance use and the
investigation of moderators of the liability to initiate
and progress in substance use when these reflect
independent liabilities of risk. The findings of this
prospective, longitudinal study represent a first step in
examining the risk factors that influence the initiation of
substance use and the progression to more frequent use
during adolescence and young adulthood.
