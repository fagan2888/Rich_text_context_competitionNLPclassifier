Mid-arm circumference (AC) measurement is a prere-
quisite for the selection of properly sized blood pressure
(BP) cuffs and accurate BP readings. This study
examined trends in the frequency distribution of mid-
AC and corresponding recommended BP cuff sizes
using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) III (1988­1994) and NHANES 1999­2002 data.
Both surveys used a complex sample design to obtain
nationally representative samples of the civilian non-
institutionalized US population. The sample consisted of
7453 men and 8372 women from NHANES III and 4295
men and 4838 women from NHANES 1999­2002. Mean
mid-AC (cm) and associated American Heart Associa-
tion-defined cuff sizes were assessed. Variables were
analysed by gender, age, race/ethnicity, and by hyper-
tension or diabetic co-morbidity. Mid-AC increased
significantly between surveys for all age groups; the
greatest increase in mid-AC occurred in the 20­39 year
age group. Data from NHANES 1992­2002 show that
among nonHispanic white and nonHispanic black men
aged 20­59 years, the mean mid-AC was 434 cm.
Among NHB women aged 40 years and above, the mean
mid-AC was greater than or equal to 34 cm. In all, 42% of
all men and 26% of all women aged 40­59 years required
large BP cuffs. In all, 39% of individuals classified as
hypertensive and 47% of self-reported diabetics re-
quired a BP cuff greater than the standard adult size.
In conclusion, mean mid-AC has increased across many
demographic subgroups in the US with implications for
the accuracy of BP measurement in clinical practice.

Introduction
Accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) is a
major public health concern: it is essential for
hypertension screening, as well as for disease
management. In the period 1999­2000, some 28.7%
of the US adult population (58.4 million Americans)
were hypertensive.1 Intra-individual, observer, equip-
ment, and environmental factors can influence BP
measurement accuracy.2,3 With respect to measure-
ment accuracy, the choice of an appropriate cuff size
for BP measurement is a critical factor.4­8 A bladder
width that is too narrow for the mid-arm circumfer-
ence (AC) will tend to overestimate BP, potentially
resulting in `cuff hypertension.' A bladder width that
is too wide for the AC results in underestimates or
incorrectly low BP readings.9,10 Using inappropri-
ately sized BP cuffs in obese individuals may result
in more biased BP readings than in nonobese
persons,11 and there may potentially be measurement
problems generally in clinical populations.12­14
Recent anthropometric data document an in-
creased prevalence of obesity among US adults.15
Also, another recent report16 demonstrated that
increased obesity in the US between 1988 and
2000 resulted in a significant increase in the
population mean mid-AC (from 31.8 to 32.9 cm)
and an increased need for large adult BP cuffs (from
42 to 45%). Since these initial reports, additional
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) population data collected between 2001
and 2002 have become available. The new data are
useful for examining detailed trends in mid-AC and
recommended BP cuff size by specific demographic
subgroups, which may be differentially affected by
trends in obesity. This study examines trends in the
distribution of mid-AC and corresponding recom-
mended BP cuff sizes over time by gender, age, and
race/ethnicity, and in special clinical subpopula-
tions (hypertensive and diabetic persons).16 The

example, in a recent study using NHANES III data,
Geiss et al17 reported that 71% of adults with
diabetes had elevated BP.
Methods
Survey description
The NHANES of the National Center for Health
Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
is composed of a sequential series of cross-sectional,
nationally representative health examination sur-
veys of the US civilian noninstitutionalized popula-
tion. A complex, stratified, multistage probability
cluster sampling design is used in the surveys.18
This report is based on an analysis of mid-AC data
for US adults 20 years of age and older in two
independent NHANES samples, NHANES III (1988­
1994) and the current NHANES 1999­2002. The
latter represents the first four years of an ongoing,
continuous survey. Informed consent was obtained
from all participants, and the protocol was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of the National
Center for Health Statistics.
Measurements
Participants were interviewed in their homes and
later examined in mobile examination centres
(MECs).19 Mid-AC was measured in centimeters in
the MEC following a standard anthropometric
protocol which was identical for both NHANES III
and NHANES 1999­2002.19,20 Since the cuff size
recommendations can vary by the manufacturer, we
used the American Heart Association definitions for
recommended BP cuff sizes.21 The mid-AC range for
the adult BP cuff size was 27­34 cm, for the large
adult size, 35­44 cm; and for the adult thigh size,
45­52 cm. In the NHANES 1999­2002 data set, mid-
AC measures less than 27 cm (corresponding to
child and infant BP cuff sizes) and greater than
52 cm represented 10.32% of the cuff fit needs of all
survey participants. These were excluded from the
cuff size analysis.
An individual was defined to have hypertension if
at least one of the following conditions was satisfied:
a systolic BP of 140mmHg or more, a systolic BP of
90mmHg or more, or currently taking medication to
lower high BP. An average of up to three systolic and
diastolic BP readings was used in applying this
definition to data from the third NHANES (1988­
1994) and the NHANES, 1999­2002 to define hyper-
tension status. A sample person was defined to have
`diagnosed diabetes' if the person reported ever having
been diagnosed as diabetic by a physician.
Sample and statistical analysis
Participants 20 years of age and over with valid mid-
AC measurement data numbered 7453 men and
8372 women in NHANES III, a survey conducted
over a 6-year period (1988­1994), and 4295 men and
4838 women in NHANES 1999­2002, the first 4
years of an ongoing survey. Survey sample response
rates were similar in both surveys; 78% of the
selected sample was examined. The study popula-
tion was further stratified by race/ethnicity. Esti-
mates of mean arm circumference and the percent of
adults with adult, large adult and adult cuff size are
presented for nonHispanic White (NHW), nonHis-
panic Black (NHB), and Mexican Americans (MA).
Based on our 1999­2002 data the weighted race/
ethnic distribution for persons 20 þ in the US is
NHW 71%, NHB 11%, and MA 7%. Persons not
classifiable into one of these groups (11%) were
included in the total population estimates but were
not separately reported.
All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS
8.2 for Windows software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA) and SUDAAN software (RTI, Research Trian-
gle Park, NC, USA). All estimates were weighted;
the sample weights account for the unequal prob-
abilities of selection resulting from the complex
sample design, survey nonresponse, and the
planned over-sampling of selected population sub-
groups. Standard errors (s.e.) were estimated with
SUDAAN using Taylor series linearization.22 For a
given race/ethnic, gender, and age group and cuff
size, the absolute difference was defined as the
mean or percentage of adults with a given cuff size
for NHANES III minus the corresponding mean
or percent for NHANES 1999­2002. In testing the
equality of the mean mid-AC and the percentage
with a given cuff size between NHANES III and
NHANES 1999­2002, the estimated absolute differ-
ence was used. This statistic follows a t distribution.
Since NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2002 are
independent surveys, the SE of the estimated
absolute difference can be estimated by the square
root of the sum of the squares of the SEs of the
estimated means or percentages from NHANES III
and NHANES 1999­2002.
Significance levels were adjusted with the
Bonferroni method to account for multiple compar-
isons for three race/ethnicity groups (NHW, NHB,
Mexican-American) and three age groups (20­39,
40­59, 60 þ years). Statistical tests were considered
significant when Po0.008 (a ¼ 0.05/6). Age adjust-
ment for the NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2002
data sets was performed using the direct method,
employing US Census population projected esti-
mates for the year 2000 provided in the NHANES
1999­2000 documentation.
Finally, the relative standard error (r.s.e.) of the
mean or percent, defined as the ratio of either the
s.e.m. or the percent to the mean or percent times
100, was used as a measure of the reliability of the
estimate. In this paper, if the r.s.e. of the estimated
mean or percent exceeded 30%, an asterisk was
placed beside it to indicate that it was unreliable.23

Results
Table 1 presents the mean values and the absolute
percent change in mid-AC values from NHANES III
to NHANES 1999­2002 by gender, age subgroups,
and race/ethnicity. As previously noted,16 among
US adults aged 20 years and above there was a
significant increase in mid-AC (Po0.001) across the
two surveys. Mid-AC increased significantly across
all age groups in men and women, with the greatest
increase in mid-AC occurring in the 20­39 year
age group. All NHW and NHB men and women
ages 20 years and older had significant increases in
age-adjusted mean mid-AC between surveys. MA of
either gender did not show a significant increase
across surveys. Also, our data show that both NHW

and NHB men aged 20­59 years have a group mean
(average) mid-AC equal to or greater than 34 cm, the
cut-point for recommending a large adult BP cuff.
Among women, only NHB women aged 40 years
and older, had a mean mid-AC greater than or equal
to 34 cm.
Additionally, we examined the percentage dis-
tributions of AHA-recommended BP cuff sizes
(adult, 27­34 cm; large adult, 35­44 cm; adult thigh,
45­52 cm) for NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2002
and the absolute change between the two surveys for
specific gender, age, and race/ethnicity subgroups
(see Table 2). Overall, from NHANES 1988­1994 to
NHANES 1999­2002, there were statistically sig-
nificant increases in the percent of males needing
the adult thigh cuff and in the percent of women
needing either the large adult or adult thigh cuff
sizes. A correspondingly smaller percentage of
adults required standard adult cuffs. Among men,
the increases in the percent requiring large BP cuff
size use was greater in the 20­39 year (from 26.6 to
35.3%, an 8.7% increase) and 40­59 year age groups
(from 32.7 to 41.8%, a 9.1% increase) than men
60 years and older (from 21.5 to 25.8%, a 4.3%
increase). Among women, those aged 60 years and
older had the largest increase in the percent
requiring large adult BP cuff size use (from 16.0 to
23.1%, a 7.1% increase). Women 20­39 years and
40­59 years had a significantly increased need for
large size BP cuff use (from 14.8 to 20.7%, a 5.9%
increase; from 21.2 to 26.1%, a 4.9% increase,
respectively). Adults ages 40­59 years as a group

had the greatest need for large BP cuffs: in 1999­
2002, 42% of all men and 26% of all women in this
age group required large BP cuffs.
Trends by gender, age, and race/ethnicity showed
that both NHW men and women ages 20 years and
older had a statistically significant absolute increase in
the percent needing large adult BP cuff sizes between
the surveys (from 28.4 to 37.2%, and from 15.9 to
22.4%, respectively). Among NHW men, those aged
40­59 years had the largest increase (33.7­44.34%, a
difference of 10.6%), whereas among NHW women,
those aged 60 years or older had the largest statistically
significant absolute increase in the proportion needing
large adult BP cuff sizes between surveys (14.9 to
22.6%, a difference of 7.7%). Similarly, NHB men
and women in all age categories had a statistically
significant absolute increase in the proportion needing
large adult BP cuff sizes between the surveys. NHB
aged 20­39 years had the largest increases: in men,
from 33 to 40.5% (a difference of 7.5%) and in
women, from 20.7 to 34.2% (a 13.5% increase).
Among MA, there were no statistically significant
changes in the distribution of BP cuff size needs
among MA men between NHANES III and NHANES
1999­2002. However, the trend observed among MA
women aged 20­39 years was opposite to that of the
general population and all of the other demographic
subgroups we compared. MA women had a statisti-
cally significant increase in the proportion of adults
requiring a standard adult cuff size BP cuff (58.1­
68%, a difference of 9.9%).
Although adult thigh-size BP cuffs are appropriate
only for a small percentage of the US population
(approximately 1 in 60 adults required such an
appropriate cuff in the most recent survey), the need
to use adult thigh cuffs almost doubled between
the two surveys. Currently 1.7% of the US adult
population (or 3.3 million adults) require an adult
thigh BP cuff size to accurately measure their BP.
Finally, we performed an assessment of recom-
mended BP cuff sizes among US hypertensives and
diabetics. Of 3136 individuals classified as hyper-
tensive, 53.4% (s.e. ¼ 1.17%) needed a standard
adult cuff, 36.3% (s.e. ¼ 0.92%) needed a large adult
cuff; and 2.6% (s.e. ¼ 0.33%) needed an adult thigh
cuff. Of 858 individuals classified as diabetic by
self-report, 48.7% (s.e. ¼ 2.4%) needed an adult cuff,
42.8% (s.e. ¼ 2.6%) needed a large adult cuff, and
4.6% (s.e. ¼ 0.9%) needed an adult thigh cuff.
Discussion
Our estimates for age-specific and race/ethnicity-
specific mid-AC and population distributions for
recommended BP cuff sizes are based on NHANES
data, which have the advantage of standardized
anthropometric examination data representative of
the US adult population 20 years of age and older.
Further, NHANES III (1988­1994) and NHANES
1999­2002 were independent samples, which per-
mits statistical comparisons. The cross-sectional de-
sign of NHANES, however, means that mid-AC is not
measured in the same individuals in the two surveys.
Therefore, in a strict sense, our trend analysis is not
comparable to a longitudinal study. Also, we chose
the American Heart Association's definitions for
recommended BP cuff sizes as the basis of our
presentation. While this is a widely accepted guide-
line in the US, the selection of cut-off points for such
guidelines, and even the design of BP cuffs them-
selves, may vary among professional societies and
internationally.24­26 Both are subjects of continuing
scientific debate; it is not our intention in this paper
to endorse one set of criteria vs another.
The findings corroborate the recent recommenda-
tions made by Jones et al 27(p 1029) that `Because of
the increasing body size of the US population, large
adult and thigh cuffs must become more widely
available regardless of the device or setting.' The
increase in obesity in the US adult population and a
concomitant general increase in mid-AC mean that
practitioners need to be especially careful to select
BP cuff sizes appropriate to the individual patient.
In the ideal case, practitioners would measure mid-
AC for each patient, calculate the cuff width to mid-
AC ratio, and select a BP cuff based on this result.
Alternately, one could select appropriate BP cuff
sizes based on a person's measured height and
weight, using standard tables recently produced.28
Generally, there appears to be the potential for
increasingly inaccurate BP readings and an over-
estimation of patients in need of therapy for
hypertension, particularly among overweight and
obese persons. For perspective, the current AHA
Guidelines recommend the use of a large size BP
cuff for individuals when the mid-AC is equal to or
greater than 34 cm.20 The data from NHANES 1999­
2002 show that, for the first time, NHW and NHB
men aged 20­59 years have a group mean (average)
mid-AC equal to or greater than 34 cm. The findings
are quite different for women. Only NHB women
aged 40 years and older have a mean mid-AC greater
than or equal to 34 cm. Indeed, this finding is
consistent with our report on obesity and over-
weight prevalence among NHB women aged 40
years and older; more than 50% were considered
obese and more than 80% were considered over-
weight or obese.15 These estimates were further
substantiated by very recent analysis based on
NHANES 1999­2002 data, which show that about
50% of NHB women in these age groups are obese
and about 80% are overweight or obese.29
The data also show that the greatest relative
increase in need for large BP cuffs occurred in
individuals aged 20­39 years. Indeed, as recently
reported,15 this age group demonstrated the largest
increase in obesity for men and the second largest
increase in obesity in women for the same time frame.
The analysis showed that the general trend
towards increased obesity and mid-AC is not
constant across all population subgroups. Specifi-

cally, Mexican American women aged 20­39 years
had a statistically significant increase in the propor-
tion requiring standard adult-sized BP cuffs needed
to accurately measure BP. By 1999­2002, some
68% of this group would be adequately fitted by
a standard adult BP cuff. This contradictory trend
is puzzling. One possible explanation is that MA
women aged 20­39 years actually decreased in
weight or increased in height across the surveys,
as both values are highly correlated with mid-AC.29
These findings will require additional research for
proper explanation. The analyses provide detailed
trends in mid-AC and recommended BP cuff size by
specific demographic subgroups in the population,
which may be differentially affected by trends in
obesity.
Finally, the findings also show that 39% of
individuals classified as hypertensive require fitting
with a BP cuff larger than the standard adult size,
and an even higher percentage of individuals
classified as diabetic (47%) require a larger than
adult-size cuff to correctly measure BP.
Summary
Based on NHANES 1999­2002 results, some 15
million men aged 40­59 years and 10 million
women aged 40­59 years currently require the use
of large-sized rather than standard adult-sized BP
cuffs for accurate BP measurement. The need for
large-sized cuffs is also rapidly growing in the 20­39
year old age group. These population trends em-
phasize the need for medical practitioner's to pay
increased attention to properly cuffing patients
before BP measurement to obtain accurate readings.

Table 3 Summary of the findings
Previous studies found
1. The proper selection of blood pressure (BP) cuff sizes for
accurate BP readings depends on mid-arm circumference
(AC) measurements.
2. Recent anthropometric data show a marked increase in
both obesity and mid-AC in the US and a significantly
increased need for the use of large adult-sized BP cuffs.
It was unknown
1. Whether the general US population trend towards
increased mid-AC applies equally to all age and race/
ethnicity groups, and to both genders.
2. What are the specific trends for mid-AC and recommended
BP cuff sizes in special clinical subpopulations, such as
hypertensive and diabetic persons.
Evidence from the current study
1. Anthropometric examination data for mid-AC from the US
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988­
2002 was used to estimate the percentage of adults
requiring selected blood pressure cuff sizes by race/
ethnicity, age and gender.
2. Overall, the greatest increase in mid-AC occurred in the
20­39 year age group.
3. A majority of Non-Hispanic White and of Non-Hispanic
Black men ages 20­59 years, and a majority of Non-
Hispanic Black women ages 40+ required large adult size
BP cuffs for proper fit. 39% of hypertensives and 47% of
diabetics required a BP cuff greater than the standard adult
size for proper fit.
