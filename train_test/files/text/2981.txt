Abstract
Objective -To examine the association between cigarette smoking and psychi­ atric disorders.
Design - The relationship between 11 psychiatric disorders and both ever­ smoking and quitting or reducing smok­ ing was determined by odds ratio analy­ sis. Statistical adjustment was employed to control for the influence of comor­ bidity among"smoking-related" psychi­
atric disorders as well as age, race, education, and urban vs rural residence. Outcome measures - Ever-smoking - a history of smoking at least one cigarette a day for one month or more. Quit/cut down - made a cessation attempt and succeeded in smoking less than 10 ciga­ rettes a day for at least 12 months.
Participants - 2980 individuals from the Durham, North Carolina (USA) epi­ demiologic catchment area interviewed in 1981-83.
Results - A history  of  ever-smoking was associated with alcohol abuse/­ dependence and generalized anxiety dis­ order among men and women. Men with generalized anxiety disorder and women with recurrent-episode major depression showed a decreased likelihood of quitting or cutting down. A weak association was observed between ever-smoking and single-episode major depression in both genders. There was no excess of ever­ smokers among individuals with schizo­ phrenia but the quit rate in this group was nil.
Conclusion - Significant associations be­ tween certain psychiatric disorders and cigarette smoking behaviour exist. These associations provide clues for developing smoking control interventions tailored to the presence of those disorders and con­ tribute as well towards improved man­ agement of smoking-related psychiatric disorders.

Waal-Manning et al reported several years ago that "negative affect", a broad concept re­ ferring to states such as depression, anxiety,


and tension, was higher among smokers than nonsmokers.1 Since then, negative affect has also been implicated as a reason for failure at smoking cessation attempts2 and as the most common antecedent of a smoking relapse.3 The first report of an association between smoking and psychiatric status was published in 1986 by Hughes et al who showed that smoking prevalence was significantly higher among those with major depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.4 Since that study, several others have reported an association between a history of ever smoking cigarettes and major depression,5 12 alcohol abuse/ dependence·' 9 anxiety disorders,9 and schizophrenia. 1a-i 5 A detrimental influence of major depression,6-8
but not of any other psychiatric disorder, on the ability to stop smoking has also been reported.
  This study extends current knowledge re­ garding the relationship between cigarette smoking behaviour and psychiatric morbidity using epidemiological data collected in 1981-83 from Durham, North Carolina (USA). Using this data set, we examined the relationships between several psychiatric dis­ orders and ever-smoking and quitting. Because of well-known gender differences in rates of our study variables (ie, ever-smoking and the quit rate are higher in men,16 major depression and anxiety disorders are more common in women, and alcohol abuse/ dependence is more common  in  men1	we performed gender­ specific analyses. Additionally, recent data suggesting that the association of major de­ pression with cigarette smoking may arise primarily from recurrent, rather than single­ episode major depression 18 (J Angst, Univer­ sity of Zurich, personal communication, 1991), prompted us to disaggregate major depressive disorders accordingly.


Methods
SUBJECTS
Data were obtained from 2980 community respondents from Durham, North Carolina, who participated in Wave 1 (1981-82) and Wave 2 (1983) of the National Institute of Mental Health-Epidemiologic Catchment Area (NIMH-ECA) study. Durham was one of five sites that took part in an epidemiological

study assessing the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the US adult  population, which is extensively described elsewhere.19 The Durham ECA programme used a stratified, multistage sampling design. In the first stage, US census districts (tracts, binary area, and enumeration districts) were selected. In the second stage, smaller segments within the districts were selected and all housing units in those segments were enumerated. In the third stage, households were selected within seg­ ments. In the fourth and final stage respon­ dents were identified within households, using the Kish method20 to select a single respondent per household. In addition to the primary sample, an oversample of approximately 900 persons aged 60 and older was obtained. The response rate at the baseline interview was 79%.


VARIABLES
Study information was collected by trained lay interviewers using a structured interview which had the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) 21 as its core and included items about smoking behaviour. For this study, we used ever-smoking and quit/cut down status as the dependent variables. Ever-smoking: all subjects were asked if they had ever smoked cigarettes daily for a month or more; positive respon­ dents to this question were labelled "ever­ smokers ". Quit/ cut down. All ever-smokers were asked if they had ever tried to quit. If they responded positively, they were then asked how long ago they had not smoked more than one-half pack per day. It was not asked specifically, however, if such former smokers had stopped smoking completely. Accordingly, the category "quit/cut down" represents smokers who had attempted to quit and were smoking less than 10 cigarettes daily for the past year or longer. Data from our smoking clinic has shown that smokers who attempt to stop but only manage to reduce their intake invariably return to their pre-quit attempt smoking level. Although that tendency may not apply to every smoker who attempts to quit (eg, less addicted smokers who do not present for smoking cessation treatment), that observation from our clinic suggests that a fair proportion of those who fall into the quit/cut down category may be complete abstainers.
  Demographic characteristics (ie, sex, age, race, education, place of residence) and 11 psychiatric disorders derived with computer algorithms  based  on DSM-III  criteria22   were examined for associations with ever-smoking and quit/cut down. The psychiatric disorders were: major depression (separated into single and recurrent types), dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, simple phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia, panic disorder, obsessive-com­ pulsive disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, schizophrenia, and antisocial personality.
  We used information obtained in Wave 1 for all variables with the exception of items needed to make a diagnosis of generalised anxiety. Since the generalised anxiety items were obtained only at the Wave 2 interview, we


adjusted the prevalence rate to include only those cases which had been reported as be­ ginning prior to the Wave 1 interview. Reports of generalised anxiety that began in the interval between the Wave 1 and Wave 2 interview were considered "non-cases".


STATISTICAL PROCEDURES
Weights were developed to adjust for non­ response and probability of selection within households of varying sizes, to downweight the oversample to its proportion in the population, and to match the 1980 census characteristics of the five-county area sampled. In the tables, the numbers of cases shown represent unweighted data whereas the percentages represent weighted data. All statistical tests were based on weighted data.
  Chi-square tests were performed for the analyses of demographic variables and p values less than 0.05 (two-tailed) were considered statistically significant. The odds ratio (OR) was used to measure the association between each psychiatric disorder and ever-smoking or quit/cut down. All subjects were used in the analyses of ever-smoking; only ever-smokers were used in the analyses for quit/cut down.
  Odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) that did not include one were considered
statistically significant. In the analyses for ever-smoking, odds ratios greater than one signified the higher likelihood of ever-smoking among individuals with the disorder in ques­ tion. In the analyses for quit/cut down, odds ratios less than one indicated a lower quit rate. For those associations which approached or reached statistical significance, we performed gender-specific multiple logistic regression to adjust for the effects of other demographic variables (ie, age, race, education, and urban vs rural residence) as well as psychiatric comor­ bidity. In the regression models, a specific disorder of interest was the dependent variable. Because the data are cross-sectional, odds ratios derived from the logistic regression can only be interpreted as indications of corre­ lational, not antecedent or causal, relation­ ships.

Results
The sample included slightly more women (55 %) than men. The average age of the sample was 42.8 years (SD  17.5); 30 % were
between  18-29  years,  28% between 30-44,
29 % between 45-64, and 14 % over 65 years old. Sixty-six per cent had completed high school, 37 % were black, and 54 % were urban residents.


DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS BY SMOKING STATUS

PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS AND SMOKING STATUS
The rates of psychiatric disorders in all respondents and by smoking status (never-­ smoking, ever-smoking, and quit/cut down) as
well as odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals   for   the   associations   between  each
diagnosis and ever-smoking and quitting are shown in table 2 for men and table 3 for women. Among men, odds  ratios  greater than two were observed for alcohol abuse/ dependence, generalised anxiety, and single major depression, but the excess of ever­ smokers suggested by those odds ratios was statistically significant only for the first two diagnoses. For quitting, an odds ratio less than one,   suggesting   a   decreased   likelihood of
stopping smoking, was statistically significant only  for   generalised   anxiety   disorder, and
approached statistical significance (95 % CI =
0.5-1.0) for alcohol abuse/dependence.
  Among women, statistically significant odds ratios indicated an excess of ever-smokers among those with alcohol abuse/dependence and generalised anxiety (table 3). Interestingly, the odds ratio for women with alcohol dis­ orders was almost two times greater than that observed for men (4.9 vs 2.8). The odds ratio for ever-smoking among women with single

major depression was in the order of 2, consistent with that observed in men, but the 95 % confidence interval differed in showing borderline significance. For quit/cut down, only one diagnostic group among the women, ie, those with recurrent major depression, showed a statistically significant odds ratio; the magnitude of that negative association (OR
= 0.1)  suggests  a  profound   inability  to stop
smoking.
  No association with either ever smoking or quit/cut down was observed for dysthymia, antisocial personality disorder, or the other anxiety disorders, ie, panic, simple phobia, agoraphobia, or obsessive-compulsive dis­ order. These data did not show an association between schizophrenia and ever-smoking; nonetheless it is noteworthy that none of the individuals with schizophrenia were able to quit or cut down.


COMORBIDITY
Results of further analyses that controlled for possible confounding due to comorbidity and demographic characteristics when the odds ratio for either ever-smoking or quit/cut down approached or reached statistical significance are shown in table 4. For both genders, generalised anxiety disorder and alcohol abuse/dependence remained significantly


resentative community sample was previously examined in St Louis, another ECA site.7 That study reported an association between major depression and both ever-smoking and smok­ ing cessation but did not disaggregate  by type of major depression. Alcohol abuse/ dependence, dysthymia, and agoraphobia were also associated with ever-smoking; however, when comorbidity with major depression was accounted for, only the effect of alcohol abuse/dependence remained significant. The present study was undertaken to replicate and refine those findings from St Louis and to examine the association between cigarette smoking and generalised anxiety disorder. (This latter condition had not  been included in Wave 1 of the NIMH-ECA study, which provided the data for the St Louis report.)
To  allow  a  direct  comparison  of findings
regarding major depression between St Louis and Durham, odds ratios for ever-smoking and quitting by gender and type of major de­ pression in each site are presented in table 5. In St Louis, a positive association between ever­ smoking and major depression, regardless of type, was observed for both genders; the odds ratios among the small number of male depressives, however, were nonsignificant. Quitting, on the other hand, was adversely related to all types of major depression in both genders; the odds ratios were significant for all

Recurrent major depression continued to show a strong negative assoc1at1on with quit/cut down among women, as did generalised anxiety disorder among men. However, for both genders the odds ratios for the association between single major depression and ever­ smoking (borderline significant in the un­ adjusted analyses) were clearly nonsignificant when adjusted for comorbidity.

For ever-smoking, a positive as­ sociation, indicated by odds ratios of two or greater, was observed only for single major depression and only the odds ratio for women approached statistical significance. For quitting, nonsignificant odds ratios somewhat greater than one did not suggest a greater inability to quit among the men, and among the women, only those with recurrent major

entirely replicate the observations regarding major depression in St Louis. These present findings also differ from those of Breslau et a"/9 who reported a significant association between nicotine dependence and major depression, and Kendler et a /12 who suggested a genetic
diathesis between major depression and ciga­ rette smoking.
  The confluence of several factors may ac­ count for the negative observations in Durham. First, although the uniform sampling design employed across centres in the NIMH-ECA resulted in comparable demographic distri­ butions among the sites, there were differences in rates of specific disorders. Most pertinently for the smoking/major depression relation­ ship, lifetime prevalence rates of major de­ pression and other affective disorders were about two times higher in St Louis than in Durham,17 resulting in a lack of power to detect statistical significance in Durham. Indeed, to observe a significant  (a=   0.05 %,
1 - b = 80 %) odds ratio of two or greater for the major depression-cigarette smoking re­
lationship as seen in St Louis7 and the Breslau et a"/9 study, the sample sizes required are 165 for men and 132 for women,23 certainly beyond the samples available in the present data set (24 men and 78 women). Moreover, it is possible that, because of the prominence of tobacco farming and cigarette manufacturing in the state, citizens of North Carolina are more tolerant of cigarette smoking, diminishing the value of cigarette smoking as an emolient for emotional distress.
  The observed association between recurrent major depression and quitting among women in the Durham ECA is noteworthy. In spite of
the relatively small number (n  = 47) of women
with recurrent major depression, their odds ratio for quitting was statistically significant. Such a dominant effect of recurrent major depression among female smokers has been seen elsewhere. Similarly, in a clinical trial of clonidine for smoking cessation, recurrent major depression was the strongest baseline predictor of inability to quit among female participants who were assigned to the placebo condition.24 The validity and generalisability of these congruent findings regarding a stronger		influence	of	recurrent	major depression on quitting require further study. They would have implications on the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions tailored to address a history of vulnerability to depression. Our findings on generalised anxiety disorder add to the limited knowledge about anxiety disorders and cigarette smoking. The obser­ vation that generalized anxiety is associated with an increased likelihood of being an ever­ smoker for both genders is consistent with earlier work by Breslau et a? and Hughes et a/4  The present data also demonstrated an adverse	relationship		between	generalised

generalised anxiety disorder (in contrast, 35 % of all participants reported past major de­ pression).24 Perhaps the link between smoking and generalised anxiety is so strong that smokers with this disorder are unlikely to attempt to stop smoking or, discouraged by failed past attempts, to seek aid from a smoking-cessation clinic.
  In contrast with findings about major de­ pression, data regarding alcoholism from the Durham ECA do correspond with those from the St Louis study in pointing to a significant association between alcoholism and ever­ smoking. The present data extend that ob­ servation by showing that the relationship occurs for both genders independently of major depression and generalised anxiety. In addition to these ECA data, there have been similar reports of an association between ever­ smoking status and alcoholism.9 25 The evi­ dence about quitting smoking among alco­ holics, however, is sparse and the present findings augment that literature. Both the crude and the adjusted odds ratios for quit/cut down among women with alcoholism reflect fewer quitters but, possible due to the small numbers, neither odds ratio was statistically significant. Among male alcoholics, the crude odds ratio also indicated a reduced ability to quit that approached statistical significance; however, the odds ratio after adjustment for comorbidity with major depression and generalised anxiety was no longer significant. This suggests that, by itself, alcoholism was not associated with the ability to quit or cut down smoking. These results are consistent with recent findings from a smoking cessation trial indicating that male smokers with a history of alcoholism but not history of major depression were equally likely to stop smoking as nonalcoholic males; however, alcoholics who also had a history of major depression had a significantly poorer outcome.26 Such cor­ respondence between results occurred in spite of differences between study samples. The alcoholic subjects in the clinical trial had all been abstinent from alcohol for at least six months and were seeking treatment for their nicotine addiction, whereas subjects in the ECA study included active as well as former alcoholics who may or may not have ever sought smoking-cessation treatment.
  Because it disagrees with previous knowl­ edge, the observed lack of association between smoking behaviour and dysthymia, antisocial­ personality disorder, and schizophrenia, de­ serves comment. Dysthymia is an affective disorder characterised by chronic depressive mood, a condition that has been  shown to relate significantly with higher smoking and lower cessation rates;26 antisocial personality disorder has been closely linked with alcohol­ ism;28 and several studies have reported higher rates of smoking among individuals with

only, this observation, to our knowledge, is without precedent. While such a finding would seem to be intuitive, we did not observe it in the Columbia University Smoking Clinic where only 3 % of participants met criteria for

negative relationships is that the very small numbers of these disorders in this data set (see tables 2 and 3) did not provide an adequate representation of smoking behaviour within those diagnostic groups.

  The results of this study add to a growing literature that has identified relationships be­ tween cigarette smoking and psychiatric syn­ dromes. The nature and the basis of these relationships, however, remain to be clarified. It is plausible that individuals vulnerable to certain psychiatric disorders are more likely to begin and continue to use nicotine, the main pharmacological substance in tobacco smoke, as a form of self-medication. On the other hand, given that the onset of cigarette smoking typically occurs during adolescence, it is also plausible that chronic, heavy exposure of the central nervous system to various pharma­ cological ingredients in tobacco has a role in promoting, if not initiating, psychiatric mor­ bidity. Studies that would test these hypoth­ eses are indicated.
  A further possibility, the existence of an underlying diathesis, has recently received support from two investigations. Studying 955 young adults who were first seen in 1989 and then again in 1990, Breslau et al found that: a) smokers with a history of major depression at Time 1 were at increased risk for progression to nicotine dependence or its increased severity at Time 2, and b) smokers with a history of nicotine dependence at Time 1 were at increased risk for first incidence major de­ pression.11 Thus, either condition, ie, nicotine dependence or major depression, predicted the other, a situation that suggests a shared vulnerability. While Breslau et a/'s finding did not clarify whether that shared factor is environmental or genetic, analysis of data from 1566 female twins by Kendler et al,12 showed that shared genes, rather than a common environment, more convincingly explained the relationship between major depression and cigarette smoking.
  Associations between specific psychiatric disorders and cigarette smoking provide clues to the management of anti-smoking inter­ ventions. Success rates of cessation pro­ grammes could be improved by incorporating psychiatric screening procedures and tailoring the course of treatment if a psychiatric history is detected. The demonstration by Hall et al8 that an affect regulation protocol increased the cessation rate among smokers with a past history of major depression, but not in smokers without such a history, supports this prop­ osition.
  Cigarette smoking has traditionally been an issue for nonpsychiatric medicine. Increased awareness of its linkage with the most common psychiatric disorders, ie, alcoholism, major depression, generalised anxiety, and schizo­ phrenia, may also serve psychiatry by in­ creasing knowledge regarding the neuro­ physiology of these "smoking-related" psy­ chiatric disorders and improving their clinical management.
