Doing ethnography or applying
a qualitative technique?
Reflections from the
`waiting field'

Abstract
Contemporary social science research is often concerned to engage with and promote particular
forms of postmodern and innovative data production, such as photo-elicitation, autoethnography
or free association interviews. This fascination with the latest and greatest techniques has been
accompanied by an ever more fragmented range of research methods training for students
where the week-by-week shift between approaches engenders a disjointed view of becoming the
researcher. This individualisation of techniques has set up rival camps and critiques where the
common ground of being embedded in traditional ethnography is often forgotten. For researchers,
who began their academic careers in the ethnographic tradition, there is an appreciation of the
holistic base of enquiry from which a family of methods can be effectively employed. However,
more recently qualitative researchers have been distracted by `the technique'; a distraction that
can blind them to the occupation of ethnography. Concurrently, there have been shifts in the
social and economic expectations placed on qualitative inquiry that have acted to close down
spaces of ethnographic teaching and practice. In response, this article focuses on the importance
of the `waiting field'; an opportunity to explore the times where real lives carry on before they
make room for the intrusion of the data production of `the technique' and remind us that much
qualitative research is, in fact, an ethnographic undertaking: one that encompasses the researcher
within and beyond the field.

Introduction
The seeds of this paper were planted in the conversations of the authors, in 2012, on four
long train journeys from Cardiff to Oxford for the Research Methods Festival1 and then
a few weeks later to Liverpool for the Doing Ethnography2 workshop. Unsurprisingly,
the nature of the events led to conversations about methodology, methods and ethnogra-
phy. In particular the second journey and the process of applying for the conference had
brought up the question ­ were we `doing ethnography'? It was a question that Dawn had
reflected on in her viva when she had been asked if she would have done anything differ-
ently. At the end of the doctoral journey, Dawn knew that she should have appreciated
earlier that she was an ethnographer, not simply someone employing techniques of data
production.
For Melanie, there remained confusion, was she doing ethnography? Of course,
Melanie was embedded in the field, it was ethnography; but she too had been blinded by
`the technique'initially. However, the space of the journey, the time to think, engendered
an agreement between two researchers, and two mothers, that our qualitative work could
be conceptualised in the analogy for motherhood, which is an evolving identity, not a
part-time occupation; for we did not simply go into the field and apply a technique ­ we
were ethnographers, even though this privilege was not always fully realised or
appreciated.
The emphasis on `the technique', rather than a holistic approach to qualitative inquiry,
has arguably been fostered by the critiques of, and inevitably defences of, the ethnogra-
pher's tools. The scrutiny of individual tools, although necessary, can also work as a
distraction, in that there is so much emphasis on the tools that the tool box of ethnogra-
phy becomes invisible. For example, interviewing is a tool of data collection widely used
by social researchers and in contemporary research many qualitative studies rely entirely,
or primarily, on interview data (Hammersley, 2008). The charge of over reliance has
attracted criticism alongside a more radical appraisal of interviews in which the potential
for the interview to engender access to information about the social worlds in which
informants live is challenged (Atkinson and Coffey, 2002).
More recently, autoethnography has been critiqued as a narcissistic preoccupation
(Roth, 2009), lazy (Delamont, 2007, 2009) and antithetical to career progression (Poulos,
2010). Even the recent attractiveness of the visual has moved to a more critical juncture
where the researchers are discussing the limitations of participatory visual methods
(Packard, 2008) and critiquing the related philosophies, ethics and methodologies in
special issues such as the International Journal of Research and Method in Education
recent edition `Problematising Visual Methods' (Lomax, 2012; Wall et al., 2012).
The problems attributed to one technique of data production are often followed by a
call for innovation such as Pink's (2009) direction to move beyond the visual to other
sensory engagement. A new `latest and greatest' to enter into arguments of critique and
defence, which may further and refine our approaches, for we should not accept qualita-
tive techniques at face value and risk research quality, but carefully discern their poten-
tialities (Hammersley, 2007). However, at the same time there needs to be an awareness
of the inherent dangers of engendering circular quarrels and opposing camps where we
could encourage collaboration.
168 Qualitative Research 15(2)
Arguably, autoethnographic experimental pieces can take the reader into a particular
social world and convey phenomenon through depictive techniques and textual devices
that foreground lived experience and carnal presence; becoming a form of self-narrative
that places the self within a social context (Doloriert and Sambrook, 2011; Poulos, 2010;
Taber, 2010). Arguably, interviews can offer insights into the perspectives that govern
behaviour and can be a sound source of witness information about what happens in par-
ticular settings or in the world more generally (Hammersley, 2007). Visual techniques
may not be `a panacea for all ethnography's ills' (Ball and Smith, 2001: 313), but argu-
ably they too can move beyond the repertoire of preconceived understandings of place
and space, unravel the diversity of urban experience and make the familiar strange and
interesting again (Mannay, 2010).
Value can be found, then, in individual techniques, but is this enough? There is an
argument to triangulate and consider plurality; however, as Darbyshire et al. (2005)
argue, multiple methods in qualitative research are not a guarantee of gaining more
insight. Perhaps, then, what is needed is a solid and secure foundation that underpins the
research journey and offers the casing for these loose tools so that they become a func-
tional tool kit. For example, in exploring the everyday use of young people's bedroom
spaces Lincoln (2012) employs interviews, observations, multi-sensory ethnography and
photo-elicitation. Rather than adopting an orthodox ethnographic approach, Lincoln
draws on a family of research tools; however, importantly, it is the security of the ethno-
graphic base and her assurance of being an ethnographer that allows Lincoln to produce
valuable qualitative research. In relation to such examples of best practice this article
poses the question: can we move beyond `the technique'and draw on wider ethnographic
traditions to make the most of our research journeys?
Tomorrow's ethnographers?
This is a particularly salient question when considering the future of qualitative research
and the new generations of researchers graduating from universities. Orsini-Jones (2010:
3) reflects on how she was `taken aback by the levels of anxiety expressed by students
with reference to their engagement with the planning of their independent piece of
research'; an anxiety we recognise from our experience of the supervision process.
However, in a school of social sciences, where students have been involved in two years
of research methods training, it is often disappointing to find that their fears and their
reluctance to engage in a holistic methodological approach are a product of the lack of
epistemic cognition.
At the risk of simplifying a complex concept, the term epistemic cognition relates to
an understanding of the nature of knowledge and knowing (Avramides and Luckin,
2007); and this apprehension about, and disengagement with, ontological and epistemo-
logical questions is problematic. For example, the experience of supervising social sci-
ence undergraduate students in their qualitative third year dissertation projects has made
us aware of a tendency for students to discuss their proposed techniques of data produc-
tion/collection without reference to any secure foundation, ethnographic or otherwise. In
this way, rather than demonstrating epistemic cognition, they engage in strategies to
avoid what Orsini-Jones (2010: 341) refers to as `troublesome knowledge'.
Mannay and Morgan 169
Students' epistemic cognition has been explored under a variety of conceptual frame-
works, including epistemological beliefs, personal epistemology and epistemic resources
(Baxter, 2004; Hammer and Elby, 2002; Schommer-Aikins, 2004); and research suggests
that students lack a complex understanding of the nature of knowledge (Hofer and
Pintrich, 1997). Koro-Ljungberg and Greckhamer (2005: 286) contend that they `cannot
envision rigorous qualitative research without any theoretical connections', but in the
technique-led approaches often favoured by emerging researchers these inadequate
foundations are evident. In this article, then, we are arguing not only that researchers
move beyond `the technique'but that as tutors we are able to enhance the students'learn-
ing and scaffold students' epistemic understanding of their qualitative research projects.
For students, and perhaps for contemporary researchers more generally, it is tempting
to rush into the field armed with audio recorder and camera. However, there needs to be
an opportunity to reflect on where research is located epistemologically and find ways to
make `troublesome knowledge' less troublesome: so that new researchers can engage
usefully with projects of qualitative inquiry. Rather than going into the field with `the
technique', students need to be encouraged to practice rigorous qualitative research. This
paper proposes an acknowledgement of ethnographic spaces as one way of addressing
this problem; and although there are theoretical differences within ethnographic
approaches, which cannot be adequately discussed within the current paper (see Koro-
Ljungberg and Greckhamer, 2005), an ethnographic base can be a good starting ground
to reflexively engage with epistemic cognition.
Ethnographic spaces
As Hammersley and Atkinson (2007: 2) contend, `ethnography plays a complex and
shifting role in the dynamic tapestry that the social sciences has become in the twenty-
first century'; and perhaps this intricacy has made it more difficult for researchers to
recognise their practice as ethnography and realise their place within an ethnographic
base. For Hammersley (2005), in basic terms, ethnography is a form of social research
that emphasises the importance of studying at first hand what people do and say in par-
ticular contexts; however, a more nuanced understanding can be gained by focusing on
what ethnographers actually do. Hammersley and Atkinson (2007: 3) offer a parsimoni-
ous explanation of the craft of ethnography as involving fairly lengthy contact with peo-
ple in everyday, rather than experimental, contexts; which involve participant observation
and/or relatively open-ended interviews and the analysis of artefacts and documents
associated with their lives.
Ethnographic approaches have many forms ­ classical, natural, interpretative and
critical ­ which have been explored in detail elsewhere (Atkinson et al., 2001; Koro-
Ljungberg and Greckhamer, 2005); however, commonalities can be found. The focus of
ethnographic research is generally fairly small-scale to engender in-depth study and the
analysis of data involves the interpretation of meanings and their relation to local and
global context; a process that for Van Maanen (2009: 16) attempts to put into writing
`what it is like to be somebody else'. The contemporary ethnographer may find them-
selves involved in a diverse range of research techniques but the definition of ethnogra-
phy remains rooted in the first-hand exploration of the research setting; as Atkinson et al.
170 Qualitative Research 15(2)
(2001: 5) contend, it is this sense of social exploration and protracted investigation `that
gives ethnography its abiding and continuing character'.
Ethnographic undertakings, then, are contained in a variety of perspectives; but
importantly its researchers are immersed in the field where spaces are never empty ­ they
value the in-between. This immersion engenders the possibility of serendipity not only
in relation to the accidental nature of something unexpected, but importantly also the
space to draw novel connections and synthesise insights (Fine and Deegan, 1996). In
contrast, for new researchers, particularly undergraduates, who plan to conduct an inter-
view between 9am and 10am, often there is a tendency to neglect the importance of the
in-between. In this way qualitative research and ethnographic undertakings become
reduced to the content of the interview hour in isolation: the transcript tells the tale and
the research diary is something that needs to be filled in the night before submission
because it is a requirement of dissertation assessment: ethnographic interviewing could
offer so much more and equip our students to become more effective qualitative
researchers.
For Delamont (2012: 57), what people do seems so much more important than any-
thing they can, or do, say; and she despairs that too much research uses interviews rather
than ethnography. Employing interviews rather than ethnography suggests the isolated
form of interviewing discussed above but ethnographic interviewing offers an opportu-
nity to use the technique of interviewing within an ethnographic undertaking.As Sherman
Heyl (2007: 371) argues, ethnographic interviewing challenges the positivistic frame-
work of interviewer as an autonomous `miner' and she evokes the travel metaphor to
position the interview as a `wandering together with', which is characterised by twists,
turns and creativity.
Interviews, visual data production and other qualitative techniques are particularly
useful when ethnographic fieldwork closes down opportunities for observation. As
Lincoln (2012) argues, the home is often seen as a type of sanctuary, which is particularly
impervious to forms of anthropological observation and this is why she selected a range
of techniques of data production from an ethnographic base. For both authors, the home
has been central and interviews and visual methods have been central tools of inquiry.
However, drawing from Sherman Heyl (2007) we have been careful to acquire a sense of
awareness of our role in the construction of meaning within the interview process, to
recognise that dialogue offers only partial knowledge and also to centralise the broader
social context and the ways in which this affects participants and the interview process.
Situating techniques within an ethnographic frameworks offers up the potential for
engendering a more nuanced understanding of social worlds; so why are ethnographic
spaces not even considered by some students and graduates of social science?
Closing down ethnographic spaces
It is, perhaps, unfair to frame students' epistemic cognition as lacking: much academic
teaching and learning comes in the form of `troublesome knowledge' (Orsini-Jones,
2010: 3); however, students work hard to gain mastery of theoretical and conceptual
material. That this mastery is not transferred into the active process of individual research
projects could be tied to the teaching of research methods in lectures and textbooks;
Mannay and Morgan 171
where techniques are divided and the view of conducting a study somewhat compart-
mentalised. However, there are many excellent research guides and much topic-based
teaching is compartmentalised; but students are still able to successfully make the rele-
vant connections.
Perhaps then we need to refocus our lens of analysis to the wider research setting;
exploring what Rogoff (2008) refers to as the community plane and interrogating the
institutional structure and cultural technologies of intellectual activity. As Mills and
Ratcliffe (2012: 147) argue, `methods and debates over methods are prisms through
which to understand the changing social and economic expectations placed upon qualita-
tive research'; and it is important to explore why ethnography may have become less
accessible to undergraduate students. What has changed in the sociopolitical and eco-
nomic landscape that could serve to close down ethnographic spaces? Some insights are
offered by turning to anthropology and, in particular, the contemporary position of the
discipline in the UK.
In her autobiographical reflection, Delamont (2012) cites her training in anthropology
as providing a lifelong commitment to ethnography; similarly for Atkinson (2012: 46
there is `no real intellectual difference between the best of anthropology and the best of
sociology': where both engage with an ethnographic imagination. Although the key
strengths of ethnographic practice were nurtured in the traditions of anthropology, eth-
nography is not simply anthropology, and anthropology is not simply ethnography ­ we
do not make this claim. However, as ethnographic researchers in south Wales, it is useful
to look across the border to England and developments in the UK as a whole, as the fate
of the anthropological tradition is moulded by force and influence, amongst complex
forces and influences that impact on contemporary higher education and academic
research in Wales.
Mills and Ratcliffe (2012) provide a sobering insight into the anthropological land-
scape by conducting interviews with academics that were trained in anthropology depart-
ments between 1990 and 2004. Some anthropologists felt that it was counterproductive
to identify as `an anthropologist' in an academic climate of the knowledge economy.
Furthermore, there was a consensus that ethnographic practices were being redefined
with research design moving away from exploratory and long-term fieldwork towards
more tightly defined commercial frames so that the ability to conduct `real ethnography'
was curtailed.
For Mills and Ratcliffe (2012) this reflects the requirements of national and interna-
tional polities and economies to train knowledge workers within an intense circulation of
concepts and commodities. As in business there is a belief that organisational reform
drives development and secures competitive advantage but the push for efficiency poten-
tially narrows the opportunities to engender `the unpredictable, the tangential and the
creative': so that all that remains is `methodological instrumentalism' (Mills and
Ratcliffe, 2012: 152).
In our own institution this fear is realised in the emerging, restricted `diets' of under-
graduate programmes where anthropological pedagogies are being extinguished in the
social science department ­ devaluing the ethnographic tradition. The business model
sets out to remove inconsistencies and inefficiencies that cannot feed into the instant
answers mode of inquiry and consequently destabilises the position of anthropological
172 Qualitative Research 15(2)
approaches. This shift signifies not just a move away from funding ethnographic research
and teaching but perhaps also a move away from all forms of in-depth qualitative inquiry
and rigorous qualitative research. In this way, students' epistemic cognition can be seen
as symptomatic of the wider high-speed, drive-by research climate that has begun to
filter into to their educational experience.
We cannot turn back the hands of time but we can try to sustain a methodological
commitment to the lessons of an ethnographic imagination; and make space to appreciate
the unexpected and unpredictable as key moments of insight: and resist the neatness and
control of the economic markets that seek to erode rigorous qualitative inquiry.
Ethnography is not simply a research technique but `an open ended, iterative, non-
prescriptive vision for social science, where the researcher is encouraged to acknowl-
edge the complexity and unpredictability of the research encounter' (Mills and Ratcliffe,
2012: 155).
These external market contingencies continue to stress the business case for research
output and often prevent researchers from indulging in `slow science', which engenders
flexibility and serendipity ­ as a combination of both chance and intuitive reasoning
(Salazar and Rivoal, 2013). The qualitative researcher is expected to condense their time
in the field, be reflective without time for reflexivity; and write and publish at speed to
keep their ethnographic account relevant before it becomes obsolete and void of economic
value: and in research-led teaching such immediacies are communicated to new genera-
tions of social scientists. When the wider socioeconomic and political forces begin to
restrict both teaching and research, how can we maintain a commitment to ethnography?
Returning to the authors' conversation on the train, yes, we conducted interviews and
employed visual methods of data production in our research where participants created
representations of their subjective interpretations of their lives; however, this does not
mean that our qualitative research was based on narrow individualism. Our training and
research in the wider field of critical social psychology has always been a practice that
engages with the sociological; we work in frameworks that are psychosocial and socio-
cultural. Our writing and conversations with each other then, have reinforced the impor-
tance of our time in the field `waiting' to engage in these research techniques. Waiting
time in research is neither empty nor without use; and in times of waiting we often learn
new things about our participants and ourselves, but the absence of an ethnographic
foundation can mean that these opportunities are not always realised.
In this paper we offer reflections from our research diaries that document this waiting
time; and the discoveries of others, and of self, doing ethnography in waiting spaces;
which we conceptualise as the `waiting field'. We realise that in introducing the `waiting
field' this is `old hat' to many ethnographers, and those engaged in other forms of rigor-
ous qualitative practice, who set out on their research with this appreciation as implicit
in their craft. However, our own experience in the field, the recent shifts in higher educa-
tion, and our work with new generations of student researchers, necessitates a considera-
tion of how to retain the salience of the in-between in contemporary qualitative inquiry.
The `waiting field' is a space in need of attention and appreciation and in the following
sections we discuss `spaces previous to', `spaces of interruption/disruption' and `spaces
of reflection'; which together form this `waiting field': a framework that seeks to central-
ise the value of ethnographic approaches.
Mannay and Morgan 173
Mothers, daughters and the research process
In her four-year, Economic and Social Research Council funded study, Dawn focused on
the everyday lives of mothers and daughters residing in a marginalised area in urban
south Wales, UK. The research employed visual and narrative techniques of data produc-
tion (Mannay, 2010) and was interested in the stigma of place, barriers to education,
gendered inequalities and the role of social class (Mannay, 2011, 2013a). Melanie worked
in similar marginalised Welsh locales and applied psychosocial interviews to explore the
subjectivities of working-class mothers in higher education; and the mechanisms and
strategies this group of women use in constructing, negotiating and managing identity/
subjectivity within university: and the motivation for pursuing academic success despite
the emotional and practical conflicts of doing so (Mannay and Morgan, 2013).
For Dawn, although the realisation was somewhat slower than necessary, she was able
to embed her research approach directly within the field of ethnography because there
were overt links. For example, ethnography expressly facilitates the desire to engage
with children's and young people's own views (James, 2001) and visual technologies are
highly visible within a long tradition of ethnographic fieldwork (Ball and Smith, 2001).
For this reason, in comparing her approach with the work of the ethnographic commu-
nity, Dawn felt that her study was accepted and welcomed; she was not simply a visual-
ista,3 but an ethnographer.
Arguably, Dawn's reading of images was embedded in auteur theory, which premises
the subjectivity of the participant creator (Mannay, 2010; Rose, 2001) rather than a rela-
tional materialism. The latter gives equal weighting to human and material elements in
the photograph, actively decentring human beings as the starting point; and appreciating
the `situational, contextual and discursively inscribed' nature of social lives (Hultman
and Lenz Taguchi, 2010: 525). Perhaps in this respect, theoretically, relational material-
ism is more closely aligned with critical forms of ethnography; acknowledging events of
activities and encounters, not accorded the same significance in Dawn's approach: and
this is an important point, one to hopefully pursue elsewhere.
However, this article specifically focuses on fieldwork in relation to the conversa-
tions with participants in `the field', common to both authors' work, where the links to
ethnographic practices are more immediately apparent. For both researchers interviews
took place in `the field', in participants' homes, in relatively unstructured interviews
and conversations. The research was in-depth and interested in the subjective meaning
making of participants: compatible with the craft of ethnography (Hammersley and
Atkinson, 2007). There was also a commitment to observing the field and going beyond
the anthropocentric gaze (Hultman and Lenz Taguchi, 2010: 526) so that other matter in
reality, innate objects, were accorded significance alongside human interactions and
subjectivities.
However, despite these commitments to ethnographic practices, for Melanie, working
in a psychosocial framework proved somewhat problematic. Dawn had applied a psy-
choanalytical lens, along with other approaches, to data analysis, but Melanie's approach
was far more embedded within the psychoanalytical traditions that form psychology's
`repressed other' (Parker, 1998). Psychosocial approaches, then, are not fully accepted
within psychology and in relation to qualitative research in the social sciences more
174 Qualitative Research 15(2)
widely they are often made invisible. For example, psychosocial research is absent from
Denzin's and Lincoln's 1994 edition of the Handbook of Qualitative Research (Midgley,
2006: 214) and this pattern can be seen in more recent texts on qualitative inquiry (see
Mannay, 2013b).
This invisibility can act as a large `No Entry' sign and is perhaps central in under-
standing why Melanie was not sure if she would be `allowed' a place at the Doing
Ethnography workshop; despite her arguably ethnographic attempt to enter the symbolic
lifeworld of others and `ascertain the subjective logic on which it is built and feel, hear
and see a little of social life as one's subjects do' (Rock, 2001: 32). This is one more
reason why it is important to emphasise the `waiting field' to highlight both the impor-
tance of these waiting spaces for researchers and students in all fields; and the opportu-
nity to both relate to and/or forge acceptance within ethnographic traditions, which can
engender opportunities for rigour in all qualitative inquiry.
Pyjamas, wet shoes and man trouble
The following accounts are taken from Dawn's research diaries to illustrate the `waiting
field'. They are `spaces previous to' because they record the times before the techniques
of data collection were applied; that is, the spaces before participants engaged in map-
making, collage creation, taking photographs, writing narratives or the related elicitation
interviews. They are also `spaces of reflection' because they were written up as research
diary entries and they informed the analysis of `the meanings, functions and conse-
quences of human actions' (Hammersley and Atkinson, 2007: 3).
Carla4 had forgotten that I was coming over and was sat in her pyjamas watching `Under the
Hammer' with Patricia (her mother). `I knew I was supposed to be doing something today but
I couldn't remember what'said Carla.
For ethnographers working in the field applying participant observation (for example
Delamont, 2006; Hurdley, 2013; Renold, 2005; Turgo, 2012), these everyday encounters
are a staple and they generate insights into social and cultural practices. However, as
Lincoln (2012) contends, the home is often impervious to anthropological observation as
the presence of the researcher breaches the traditional boundaries between the public and
the private. For this reason, I could not immerse myself within the territory of mothers'
and daughters' homes. The `waiting field' of `spaces previous to' then becomes particu-
larly important for it allows an opportunity for a glimpse of the familiar practices of
home life; of pyjamas, television and the `companionate relationship'that has been docu-
mented in previous studies of family life in south Wales (Barker, 1972: 582): such `spaces
previous to' can also be useful in reflecting on the ways wider social issues impact on
everyday lives.
It has been raining and I am waiting for Siân outside her house in the rain and when she arrives
we go inside. Before the interview Siân said `I will have to put the radiators on to dry my shoes
as they are soaked through with rain', and she puts her shoes on the radiator. `I've only got one
pair' she explains, `there is never any money left for me after the kids'. This is the reality of
Mannay and Morgan 175
living on low income, having to walk around in wet shoes. When your income gets higher you
forget about these things, the everyday inconveniences and the small miseries. I have walked
around with holes in the only shoes I've got, wet, cold feet and bronchitis on top. It becomes
normal at the time and is forgotten when you have more shoes than you really need.
For me, observing the routine way in which Siân puts on the radiators to dry her shoes
acts as a stark, visual reminder of the everyday inconveniences and the small miseries
that make up the reality of living on a low income. Lack of resources and the routines of
coping with poverty become normalised and therefore often absent and made invisible in
interview talk. In this way `spaces previous to' again provide an added depth of insight
into Siân's everyday life; they provide an opportunity for serendipitous research. `Spaces
of reflection' are also important and writing the research diary acted to reinforce the
point that it is all too easy to overlook the materiality of poverty, in fact the mode of writ-
ing with pen and paper, as opposed to computer keyboard, elicited a more emotional
response to the data: and this `space of reflection' augmented the possibilities of the data
encountered in the fieldwork process.
I call into see Eleri and her neighbour is there and her friend and friend's sister. The neighbour
was going to have a 21st birthday party at one of the local working man's clubs and had been
giving her father money each week to pay off the room hire and DJ as he goes to the club. When
she had called in to check something out she found there was no booking ­ her father had spent
all the money and never paid anything off so the celebration is cancelled. This led to a
conversation about the trouble with the men in these women lives; about having to watch that
sons don't steal out of your purse and how its good to have a small handbag so you can carry
it everywhere with you ­ to the toilet and you can even sleep with it. Everyone thinks badly of
the neighbour's father and the other thieving sons and husbands but the worrying thing is that
no one is that shocked or surprised about anything, not even me, it is seen as wrong but still
expected, accepted ­ there is a tacit normalisation that this is what things are like.
This excerpt represents both `spaces previous to' and `spaces of reflection'; and the obser-
vation was particularly salient because, as I worked with a small sample of 18 participants,
the charge that I may have based my research on an unrepresentative set of voices was
often levied. This brief participant observation, and further experiences with a similar
demographic in the area, were consistent with my interviews with participants around their
own gendered relationships and those of their wider family and friendship networks.
In this way, `spaces previous to' and `spaces of reflection' provided an opportunity to
explore the ways in which the data created with participants, rather than being unusual,
was representative of some of the wider experiences of mothers and daughters within this
urban locale. However, these spaces do not necessitate a form of demarcation where the
`previous to' and `reflection' become representations of some pure and suspended
research space. All spaces are characterised by fluidity and multiplicity (Massey, 1994),
and for many researchers, they do not need to be named. Consequently, we are not push-
ing methodological boundaries by simply imposing categorisation on the journeys that
already characterise rigorous qualitative inquiry. The naming of spaces, and the apparent
demarcation, is a strategy in response to the arguments raised earlier in the paper in rela-
tion to the ways in which these spaces are currently threatened by invisibility in both
teaching and research.
176 Qualitative Research 15(2)
Reflecting on the `waiting field', these types of records were important for capturing
aspects of mothers' and daughters' everyday lives and my reactions and reflections. The
ethnographic experience is accessible within these `spaces previous to', the times where
lives carry on before they make room for the intrusion of the data production tech-
niques; however, such spaces do not exist in a vacuum, and even with the removal of the
technique the intrusive presence of the researcher remains. It is essential then to recog-
nise the dynamic relationship between the researcher and the researched in the `waiting
field'.
Arguably, there is always some form of presentation of self (Goffman, 1959) and as
Allport (1954: 5) maintains `thoughts, feelings, and behaviours of individuals are influ-
enced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of other human beings'. In the `wait-
ing field' notebook and audio recorder may be hidden out of sight but the researcher and
research aims, and wider social norms and values are a continuing and constant influ-
ence. Perhaps, then, we need to expect, embrace and evaluate such influence; and con-
sider whether the `intrusive presence'of the researcher is `a threat, a benefit or simply an
inescapable facet of social science research, where meanings are always negotiated,
revised and co-constructed' (Mannay, 2013c: 144).
Enlarging the scope of participant observation cannot eliminate the issue of intrusion
but it is important to centralise the `waiting field' as a salient aspect of the research
process, which can be equally important as the time spent applying techniques of data
production. Acknowledging the `waiting field' offers opportunities to engage with the
field in a qualitatively different way that can enable a richer perspective and act to further
our understandings. For this reason, `spaces previous to'and `spaces of reflection'should
not be neglected in research practices constrained by the drive towards perpetual organi-
sational reform, aimed at gaining advantage in the competitive landscape that is contem-
porary higher education. The following section will begin to explore the ways in which
`spaces of interruption/disruption' are also important in the `waiting field'.
Cutting the grass and the mobile phone
The following accounts are taken from Melanie's research diaries to illustrate the `wait-
ing field'. They are `spaces of interruption/disruption' because they intrude on the data
production technique of the interview but in the same way as `spaces previous to', such
intrusions allow opportunities for fresh insights. The following diary entry refers to
Jordan, a 21-year-old student who lives with her mum and brother; and 22-month-old
son. Jordan has a very supportive family relationship that can be described as one of
`joint organisation' (Bott, 1971: 87), featuring considerable visiting and exchange of
services between close-knit, extended, kinship networks, which have been typical of
many Welsh working-class everyday lives. It is one of these family visits that intrude on
the space of the interview:
During our interview at home her grandparents turned up to cut the grass. Jordan explained
that she was in the middle of an interview but the grandparents insisted `they wouldn't be any
bother'. As a result the interview took place with the grandparents partially present, going back
and forth between the living room and the garden ­ which really disrupted the interview. My
mind went blank.
Mannay and Morgan 177
In this excerpt the visit of the grandparents is initially viewed as an interruption; it is a
disruption of the data production technique of the interview ­ `My mind went blank'.
However, applying a wider ethnographic lens that acknowledges and appreciates this
rupture as allowing access to the waiting field, offers an insight into the dynamics of
`joint organisation' (Bott, 1971: 87) in this particular family. The grandparents have
come to cut the grass, but watching the interactions between family members in these
ruptures suggests that the visit is about more than cutting the grass.
Jordan's grandmother suffers from senile dementia and neither of the grandparents
are efficient gardeners; arguably, it would have been quicker and easier for Jordan, her
mother or her brother to cut the grass. The visit then is not simply about gardening; it is
about being together, being a family and engaging in practices that allow and engender
the making and remaking of this relational unit. In this case, the space of interruption
has provided an insight into an exchange of services that is not based on rationality or
practicality; rather, it is an exchange centred on support and love, and care: the affective
practices which `hold or contain' a family, binding them together. In the following
reflection we see how `spaces of interruption/disruption' offer insights to the ways in
which such making and remaking is also achieved through more negative practices.
Cheryl has accused Tanya of being a bad mother on several occasions because of her attendance
at university/placement (even threatening to call social services), particularly when the children
are ill. Indeed during my visit Tanya's home telephone and mobile rang at least a dozen times
(it seemed constant). Twice I asked Tanya if she wanted me to stop so she could answer but she
said `it's only my sister and she will only have a go at me'. Within the working class post
industrial communities in which we live there is often a pervasive cultural attitude: it is ok to
do things as a woman as long as it doesn't interfere with what are considered to be expectations
of `care'and understandings of what a good mother is/does. I'm angry.
The ongoing interruptions of the phone calls can also be seen as part of the `waiting
field', forming a series of `waiting ruptures', which again disrupt the data production
technique of the psychosocial interview. However, these interruptions act to open up a
backroom view, providing an insight into an interrupted/disrupted space where the omni-
present, but often hidden, relational and affective aspects of being a working class mature
student mother are exposed. Experiencing these interruptions first-hand was important
and powerful, the anxiety was palpable and the weight of feeling much heavier than
something that could have been generated in a post-hoc and rationalised discussion of the
events. In this way `spaces of interruption/disruption' offer a more nuanced understand-
ing of Tanya's everyday life and family relations, which may not have been centralised
so vividly within the interview process.
Melanie experienced first-hand how personal history, subjectivity and affective prac-
tice are formed in social relations and the affective routines of everyday family life
(Wetherell, 2012), and how the patterning, knitting and knotting together of affective
practices; their resistant and contradictory nature, sometimes play out at times as unbear-
able. Experiencing these relational fields as `spaces of interruption/disruption' provided
a clearer understanding of the backdrop to which higher education is conducted and
pursued.
178 Qualitative Research 15(2)
Additionally, the feelings of the researcher partially emerge during the `waiting field'
of critical ethnography ­ `I'm angry'. As Walkerdine (1997: 15) argues, social science
research `provides not only ways of seeing others, but ways of understanding ourselves';
and the anger engendered in this `space of interruption/disruption' is important as it
necessitates a recognition of the subjective nature of interpretation; and the emotional
life of both researcher and researched. The role of serendipity in guiding the research
journey demonstrates how important it is for the researcher to think on their feet in field-
work and to see diversions from the planned research techniques not as wrong but simply
as different (Arora, 2008); `spaces of interruption/disruption' can potentially open up
new opportunities. For all these reasons, the intrusion of the phone calls offers a far more
holistic view of the research field and the actors within this field.
Concluding remarks
As we argued in the introduction, the fragmentation of social research methods teaching
and the expectations of the neoliberal knowledge economy can engender a focus on
applying `the technique'; which acts to sideline the importance of ongoing traditional
ethnographic and reflective engagement. For these reasons, students and new researchers
may neglect the `waiting field' and sacrifice the opportunity to enjoy the richness of
ethnographic fieldwork. In response, this paper has presented research diary extracts,
which centralise the salience of the `waiting field' and its potential to produce more use-
ful fieldwork.
Individual techniques are valid methods of inquiry but arguably they need to be
embedded in traditional ethnography or forms of vigorous qualitative research that dem-
onstrate epistemic cognition. Emphasising the importance of the `waiting field', as an
opportunity to explore the times where real lives carry on before they make room for the
intrusion of the data production techniques, could prove a useful remedial strategy in
contemporary research methods training. As Salazar and Rivoal (2013: 180) contend, `in
research, serendipity as such cannot be really "planned", but the conditions facilitating
the process can be manipulated'; consequently, in research projects with set remits and
timescales antithetical to the anthropological and ethnographic traditions, it becomes
pressing to make each moment in the field count.
In short then, the article argues for an appreciation of the potential for discoveries of
others, and of self, doing quality ethnography and qualitative research in the `waiting field'.
The `waiting field' was presented across accounts from two separate research studies,
exploring the research diary as a reflective and reflexive space; and demonstrating the
ways in which empirically and methodologically, it is imperative to acknowledge the
ethnographic base and be mindful of `spaces previous to', `spaces of reflection' and
`spaces of interruption/disruption'. Importantly, the paper has centralised the need to
work with a `family of methods' (Lincoln, 2012) from a strong ethnographic base.
However, where researchers or students feel that their philosophical principles cannot sit
within an ethnographic approach or that there is a large `No Entry' sign that prevents
their acceptance, here perhaps there can be an engagement with the `waiting field'; as an
ideological bridge that allows movement beyond `the technique'so that we can make the
most of our research journeys.
