Abstract
Human vision is extremely sensitive to equidistance of spatial intervals in the frontal plane.
Thresholds for spatial equidistance have been extensively measured in bisecting tasks. Despite
the vast number of studies, the informational basis for equidistance perception is unknown. There
are three possible sources of information for spatial equidistance in pictures, namely, distances in
the picture plane, in physical space, and visual space. For each source, equidistant intervals were
computed for perspective photographs of walls and canals. Intervals appear equidistant if
equidistance is defined in visual space. Equidistance was further investigated in paintings of
perspective scenes. In appraisals of the perspective skill of painters, emphasis has been on
accurate use of vanishing points. The current study investigated the skill of painters to depict
equidistant intervals. Depicted rows of equidistant columns, tiles, tapestries, or trees were
analyzed in 30 paintings and engravings. Computational analysis shows that from the middle
ages until now, artists either represented equidistance in physical space or in a visual space of
very limited depth. Among the painters and engravers who depict equidistance in a highly
nonveridical visual space are renowned experts of linear perspective.

Equidistant Intervals in Pictures
Human vision is extremely sensitive to equidistance of spatial intervals in the frontal plane.
Thresholds for spatial equidistance have been most extensively measured in bisecting tasks
(Cappe, Clarke, Mohr, & Herzog, 2014; Chieffi, 1999; Fechner, 1860; Garcia-Suarez, Barrett,
& Pacey, 2004; Levi & Klein, 1983; Milner, Brechmann, & Pagliarini, 1992; Nielsen,

McCarthy, & Beaumont, 2002; Volkmann, 1863; Westheimer, Crist, Gorski, & Gilbert,
2001; Wilkinson & Halligan, 2003). Despite the vast number of studies in normal subjects
and patients, the neural mechanism behind visual equidistance is still largely unknown.

Until now, research concentrated on bisection in the frontal plane. Little is known about the
sensitivity of human vision to equidistance in depth. Even the spatial information employed
still awaits discovery. Information may come from one of three possible sources. Figure 1
shows predictions for bisection of a spatial interval in a picture. Bisection may be related to
the proximal (Figure 1(a)), distal (Figure 1(b)), or perceived (Figure 1(c)) stimulus. The image
in the picture plane is taken to be equivalent with the proximal image. If information is
extracted from the proximal stimulus, b will bisect interval ac if ab equals bc (Figure 1(a)).
This type of bisection will be called proximal bisection. If bisection is related to the layout of
the distal stimulus, p, that is, the projection of bisection point P of the physical interval AC
onto the picture plane will generally not bisect interval ac (Figure 1(b)). The position of p is
closer to c than a, if A is nearer to the observer than C. Lines parallel to AC meet at the
infinitely far vanishing point VP. This type of bisection in a picture is dubbed bisection in
physical space. A third option is that bisection is related to the layout of the stimulus in visual
space (Figure 1(c)). Many studies have shown that visual space, that is, the space we perceive
through vision, differs from physical space. A recent reanalysis of classic experimental results
unveiled that physical space and visual space and also the proximal image are perspective
transformations of each other (Erkelens, 2015a). The spaces differ by just a single parameter,
namely, the distance of vanishing points. The distance is infinite for physical space, finite for
visual space, and zero for the proximal image. The new model is simpler and more powerful
than the model of a curved visual space championed by Luneburg (1947, 1950) and Blank

(1953, 1961) because it describes more experimental data. In Figure 1(c), line piece AC in
physical space transforms to line piece A0C0 in visual space. Lines parallel to AC in physical
space converge in visual space to vanishing point VP0, located at finite distance from the
observer. V bisects A0C0 in visual space. Point v is the projection of V onto the picture plane.
The position of v differs from that of b (Figure 1(a)) and p (Figure 1(b)). Point v is located in
between b and p at a position that depends on the distance of vanishing point VP0. In
principle, human observers have access to each of the three sources of information.
Proximal intervals are directly available from the retinal image. Most assessments of
spatial intervals, however, are made across fixations and, hence, require a spatiotopic map
of saccade locations in addition to the retinal image. Intervals in physical space follow from
knowledge based on interactions of the observer with the physical environment. Intervals in
visual space are available from quantitative probes of visual perception.
To explore equidistance in perspective pictures, bisection locations were computed for
spatial intervals in photographs of a wall and a canal (Figure 2). Pairs of parallel white
lines represent spatial interval ac shown in Figure 1. Positions of the three bisection points
were computed by solving the geometric equations that describe bisection according to the
different sources of information. Measurement of the horizontal (wall) or vertical (canal)
positions of the white lines in the photographs provided the positions of a and c. Positions of
the vanishing point projections (vp) were obtained by measuring the positions of intersections
of perspective lines in the pictures. The equations for bisection in the physical and visual
spaces were solvable for known intersection positions between extensions of AC and A0C0
and the screen. A position at one screen size outside of the screen border was chosen as the
position of intersection. Proximal bisection positions were directly computed from the
positions of a and c on the screen. Veridicality of computed bisection positions in physical
space was verified by counting the segments of the concrete wall and the trees along the canal
in the picture. The positions of bisection in visual space were computed by further assuming
that the vanishing point VP0 was located at twice the viewing distance of the photographs.
It requires a ruler to convince oneself that the yellow dots bisect the intervals between the
parallel white lines in the photographs (Figure 2). The necessity of having to rely on a ruler

suggests that equidistance judgments are not based on measures of the proximal stimulus.
This suggestion is in line with earlier bisection results of Blank (1961) and a recent study
showing that the detection of two-dimensional symmetry patterns is subject to the three-
dimensional (3D) configuration of scenes (Chen & Shio, 2015). Acceptance of the cyan dots
as indicators of bisection in physical space is based on cognition rather than visual
perception. As mentioned earlier, counting trees and wall segments was needed to make
educated guesses about bisection in physical space. Visually the cyan dots appear much
too close to the distant lines. The magenta dots seem better candidates for visual bisection.
Computed positions of the magenta dots depend on the assumed distance of vanishing point.
Due to individual differences between computed depths of visual space (Erkelens, 2015b), the
magenta dots may represent suboptimal positions for bisection to individual observers.
Picture Positions of Equidistant Positions in Physical Space
To quantify the effect of the selected intersection positions between stimulus and screen on
bisection positions in the picture, bisection positions were computed for a range of
intersection positions. Bisection in physical space proved to be independent of the chosen
intersection position. If a, c, and vp have fixed positions on the screen then all possible
intervals AC in physical space are parallel to each other (Figure 1(b)). Inspection of
Figures 1(b) and 3(a) shows that parallel displacement of AC does not affect the position
of p because all triangles OAC are similar. On the other hand, bisection in visual space does
depend on the position of the intersection point. Potential intervals A0C0 rotate relative to
each other about the finite vanishing point and consequently the position of v changes with
the orientation of A0C0. Bisection in physical space proved also to be independent of the
position of the observer relative to the picture. Computations of p showed that if a, c, and vp
were kept at fixed positions, the position of p remained fixed for all directions of O relative to
the picture (Figure 3(b)). Computations of p also showed that the position of p remained
fixed for all viewing distances (Figure 3(c)). As a result, the position of p in the picture is
independent of distance and direction of the observer relative to the picture. The position of p
is fully specified by the positions of a, c, and vp and thus only by aspects of the picture itself.
Proximal bisection and bisection in physical space share this property.
The method for establishing bisection positions in pictures can be generalized to
equidistant positions for any number of intervals. Computations were made for larger
numbers of equidistant intervals. Figure 4(a) shows the geometry for a row of four
equidistant intervals in physical space. Positions of the proximal stimuli p depend only on
the positions of a, c, and vp. Figure 4(b) shows the positions of p as functions of the position
of c relative to the positions of a and vp. Similar as for bisection, the positions of a, c, and vp
in the picture uniquely specify the division in intervals. Geometric analysis shows that, what
may seem counterintuitive, knowledge of the distal stimulus in physical space is irrelevant for
the division of a line piece in equidistant intervals in a picture.
Equidistant Intervals in Perspective Photographs
To compare equidistance in the various spaces, equidistant intervals were computed for the
perspective photographs of wall and canal that were earlier shown in Figure 2. Figure 5
shows intervals that are equidistant in the picture (Figure 5(a) and (b)), in physical space
(Figure 5(c) and (d)), and in visual space (Figure 5(e) and (f)). One can interpret the sizes of
intervals in two ways. One can interpret their sizes in terms of distances in depth along the
underlying surface or compare their sizes relative to each other in terms of viewing angles.

Equidistant intervals in the plane of the picture (Figure 5(a) and (b)) are not perceived as
equidistant according to either interpretation. Intervals that are identical in terms of visual
angle but viewed at different distances are perceived differently according to the
size--distance invariance hypothesis (Epstein, 1963; Wagner, 2006). The intervals are also
perceived as different if one tries to ignore the depth of the surface. The perceived increase in
line spacing with increasing surface depth even persists if a ruler is placed across the lines.
Incompatibility between perceived intervals and ruler readings presents a strong visual
illusion. Spatial intervals that are equidistant in physical space (Figure 5(c) and (d)) are
also perceived as highly different from each other. By reasoning, one can accept that the
intervals are equidistant along the receding surfaces. However, the decrease in line spacing

between yellow lines are equidistant in the picture plane (a, b). Intervals between cyan lines (c, d) are

appears to progress irregularly with surface depth. The near intervals seem overly large, most
prominent in the canal example of Figure 5(d). Sizes of intervals appear to decrease more
regularly with distance if the intervals are computed in visual space (Figure 5(e) and (f)).
Similar to the computed bisection intervals of Figure 2, a distance of twice the viewing
distance was chosen for the vanishing point. Now the intervals appear to decrease in size
rather regularly with distance. Such a decrease is in agreement with the size--distance
invariance hypothesis that was mentioned earlier. The gradient in interval size appears
regular and more natural when the intervals are computed in visual (Figure 5(e) and (f))
rather than physical space (Figure 5(c) and (d)).
Equidistant Intervals in Perspective Paintings and Engravings
To gain insight in how we perceive equidistance in pictures, it may be illuminating to
investigate how painters, both amateurs and experts in linear perspective, have depicted
equidistant intervals on canvas (Kemp, 1990; Kubovy, 1986). Veridical depiction of
equidistant intervals in 3D scenes prescribes that painters have to follow the geometric
rules of linear perspective in relation physical space. It is known that Italian painters such
as Filippo Brunelleschi and Piero della Francesca already applied rules and constructions of
linear perspective in the 15th century. To compare the depiction of equidistant intervals by
artists across the ages, photographs of paintings and engravings were copied from the
internet (see Appendix 1). Fragments were selected that contained four equidistant
intervals and their associated vanishing point. An exception was made for ``The Last
Supper'' and its followers because the images contained rows of only three equidistant
intervals. The fragments were displayed on the computer screen so that they fully filled the
screen. Coordinates of borders of intervals and vanishing points were measured in millimeters
relative to the left and lower border of the screen, using a ruler. The near border of the
nearest interval was designated a and the far border of the fourth (third for the Last Supper
pictures) interval b (Figure 1). Intermediate interval borders were computed from the
equations describing proximal equidistance, and equidistant intervals in physical and
visual space, respectively. Since in visual space intervals depend on distance of the
vanishing point and intersection position of the perceived surface with the screen, borders
were computed for a wide range of vanishing distances and intersection positions.
Combinations of vanishing distance and intersection position that produced the best fits
between computed and painted borders were supposed to describe the visual space that
was used by the painter.
Depth (D) of visual space in a picture is defined as distance of the vanishing point relative
to the observer minus viewing distance of the picture. Figure 6 shows fragments of three
paintings and one engraving. The tiles of Vermeer's ``The Music Lesson'' show intervals that
closely match equidistant intervals in a specific visual space (Figure 6(a)). The optimal visual
space has a depth larger than 100 viewing distances. It is indistinguishable from physical
space within the precision of the computations. Agreement of the painted intervals with
intervals in physical space shows that Vermeer accurately followed the rules of linear
perspective. It has been proposed that Vermeer used a camera obscura to achieve such a
photograph-like veridicality (Steadman, 2001). The other panels of Figure 6 show that such
an agreement was not always found in paintings and engravings. Leonardo da Vinci painted
tapestries in ``The Last Supper'' that are not equidistant in physical space although the errors
are not very large (Figure 6(b)). However, there is a visual space clearly different from
physical space that describes Leonardo's intervals much better. This visual space has a
depth of 11 viewing distances. Differences between depicted and computed intervals in
Erkelens 7
relation to physical space are much larger for the engraving of a tomb by Hans Vredeman de
Vries (Figure 6(c)) and the painting of Canaletto of ``The Interior of Henry VII's Chapel in
Westminster Abbey'' (Figure 6(d)). In both pictures, the best fitting borders that indicate
equidistant intervals in visual space (magenta dots) are about in the middle between those
indicating equidistant intervals in physical space (cyan dots) and the picture plane (yellow
dots). Visual space in these pictures has a depth of just two viewing distances.
Depth of visual space was computed for 30 pictures. Paintings and engravings were
selected in which perspective was applied with great accuracy. Paintings such as for
instance ``Mystery and Melancholy of a Street'' (1914) of Giorgio de Chirico were
excluded because of inaccuracy in vanishing points. Computed depths of visual spaces can
be divided into two groups. In one group of 12 paintings and 2 engravings, depths are larger
than 100 viewing distances (Table 1). These visual spaces are indistinguishable from physical
space implying that the artists accurately applied the rules of linear perspective. In the other
group of 15 paintings and 1 engraving, depths of visual spaces are shorter than 12 viewing
distances (Table 2). Mean depth and standard deviation of this group is 5.2 Æ 3.2 viewing
distances. From the middle ages until now, artists have painted equidistant intervals in
physical space (D > 100) or visual space. Mean absolute error (MAE) and standard
deviation is 1.7 Æ 1.0% for the physical space group and 1.4 Æ 1.0% for the visual space

applied exclusively perspective related to physical or visual space. The Dutch architect and
painter Hans Vredeman de Vries (1527­1607) is here the exception. He applied the rules of
linear perspective in relation to physical space with great accuracy in engravings, published in
a book on perspective. On the other hand, he painted an architectural fantasy of a palace and

Discussion
Directions and Distances in Different Perspective Spaces
Recent analysis of classic experimental results provided evidence for the hypothesis that
visual space is a perspective transformation of physical space (Erkelens, 2015a). Pictures as
planar equivalents of proximal images are also perspective transformations of physical space.
Physical space, visual space, and pictures are perspective spaces that just differ by the size of a
single parameter, namely, the distance of vanishing points. Distances are infinite in physical
space, finite in visual space, and zero in pictures. The idea of visual space as a perspective
space arose from observations that perceived angles between in-depth oriented rails and bars
are weighted averages between the physical angles and the angles in the proximal image
(Erkelens, 2015b, 2015c). Perspective transformation of space affects distances but leaves
directions unchanged. Therefore, vanishing points have identical directions relative to the
observer in physical space, visual space, and the proximal image (Figure 1). As a
consequence, studies on the quality of linear perspective in paintings and drawings are
incomplete if analysis is confined to the accuracy of vanishing points. Complete studies of
linear perspectives should include analysis of distances. The current study analyzed how
equidistant intervals in physical and visual space relate to intervals in pictures.
The computations involved relative distances along straight lines. This means that linear
errors in pictures caused by stretching did not affect the results. Linear errors occur for
instance when changes are made in the aspect ratio of pictures. Higher order errors cause
straight lines to become curved. Analysis of the vanishing points did not reveal such errors in
photo's and paintings that were downloaded from the internet.
One result of the current analysis is that, if intervals in a picture indicate equidistance in
physical space, they do so for all viewing positions and distances of the physical stimulus to
the picture. These invariances have not been reported until now and are a remarkable aspect
of linear perspective in relation to physical space. The invariances do not hold for linear
perspective in relation to visual space. Since the 15th century, many artists have used
construction methods to depict intervals that are equidistant in physical space along in-
depth oriented lines. A consequence of the invariances is that, if such methods are used,
intervals in the picture still correctly indicate equidistant intervals in physical space for
viewpoints other than the one from which the picture is made. The invariance may explain
why photographs and movies viewed from oblique directions are perceived as being rotated
rather than deformed (Cutting, 1987; Gombrich, 1972; Goldstein, 1979; Halloran, 1993;
Koenderink, van Doorn, & Kappers 2004; Kubovy, 1986; Papathomas, Kourtzi, &
Welchman, 2010).
Equidistant Intervals in Paintings
It is remarkable how artists depict equidistant intervals in paintings and engravings. The
studied intervals show that a great number of artists, intentionally or not, applied
perspective in relation to visual instead of physical space. Among the painters who strongly
deviated from equidistance in physical space are renowned experts of linear perspective such as
Panini, Piranesi, and Canaletto (Thompson, 2003). The vanishing points in the paintings and
engravings of this study show that all artists applied linear perspective with great accuracy, as
far as directions are concerned. The small MAEs between depicted and computed intervals
10 i-Perception 0(0)
show that for distances painters applied perspective with great accuracy too. This is true for all
artists in this study because, in general, MAEs were equally small for equidistance in visual
and physical space. Small MAEs are remarkable for paintings showing equidistant intervals in
visual space because their makers could not use tools or tricks to achieve a high degree of
perfection. In contrast, artists drawing equidistant intervals in physical space could use
methods such as the costruzione legittima. Such methods do not exist for equidistance in
visual space. Making use of yardsticks in the plane of the picture would not have been
helpful either, as the yellow dots show in Figure 6.
Artists have pictured equidistant intervals either in physical or visual space from the 15th
century until now. Realist painters such as Johannes Vermeer, Gustave Caillebotte, Carel
Willink, Richard Estes applied perspective in relation to physical space to arrive at
photograph-like veridicality. Painters such as Leonardo da Vinci, Hans Vredeman de Vries,
and Dirck van Delen used perspective in relation to visual space in their fantasy paintings. The
vedute painters Antonio Joli, Giovanni Panini, Giovanni Piranesi, and Canaletto applied
perspective in relation to visual space both in their fantasy and realistic paintings. From
visual inspection alone, it is difficult to distinguish nonveridical from veridical perspective.
For example, ``The Last Supper'' and the ``tomb'' of Hans Vredeman de Vries appear as
realistic as ``The Music Lesson'' and the ``Interior of Henry VII's Chapel'' (Figure 6).
Computation first shows the considerable differences. Hans Vredeman de Vries, an engineer
by training, may have been aware of the distinction between both types of perspective because
he applied both techniques. He purposely may have applied perspective in relation to visual
space for one or two reasons. He may have found the painting more attractive or he used it
because it allowed him to draw distant objects in more detail than in the case of linear
perspective. Distant objects are most compressed in linear perspective, less in visual space,
and not at all in physical space. The latter reason is particularly relevant for engravings where
depicting details is limited by the coarseness of the needles. It is amusing to notice that
perspective in relation to visual space has been applied in the ``Terror Subterra'' illusion
(Shepard, 1990). It is amusing because the illusion is generally explained by the size­depth
relationship of projections from physical space onto planar surfaces. Another example of
erroneous projection is given by an instruction video on how to draw perspective (last item
of Table 2). It shows intervals that are equidistant within an extremely confined visual space.
Apparently, both viewers and makers are not aware of the errors of projection.
The fact that expert painters depict perspective in relation to visual space seems
paradoxical. Projections of 3D scenes on flat surfaces contain linear perspective. These
photographic projections produce retinal images identical to those produced by the 3D
scenes themselves. When using projections based on perspective in relation to visual space
in the painting, one would be inclined to conclude that the ensuing visual perception of the
scene would be nonveridical and nonrealistic. On the contrary, perspective related to visual
space is experienced as very natural in paintings (see the examples in Figures 5 and 6). An
explanation for the paradox may be that perception of 3D scenes in pictures differs from
perception of real scenes (Erkelens, 2015b, 2015c). To emphasize this difference, visual space
in pictures is generally named pictorial space. Apparently, about half of the investigated
painters used perspective in relation to visual space so that in the pictures the depicted
intervals appeared consistent with other attributes of depth.

Author Biography
Casper J. Erkelens, earned a degree in physics from Radboud
University at Nijmegen and his PhD from Utrecht University. He
commenced his eye movement research with Han Collewijn at
Erasmus University Rotterdam. His academic career continued at
the Physics and Psychology departments of Utrecht University.
Initially, research was devoted to describing and understanding
binocular eye movements. Later, his interest progressively
expanded to the processes underlying binocular vision and their
relationship to eye movements. Currently, he works on conflicts
between binocular and monocular vision that may arise when 3-D
scenes are imaged on 2-D media such as paper, canvas and the
various kinds of (projection) screens. After his compulsory
retirement in 2015, the dean of the faculty of Social Sciences of Utrecht University granted
facilities enabling him to continue research.
