and White Older Adults

Guided by a stress and coping model, we explored determinants of depressive symptoms among community
samples of older African Americans (n = 255) and older Whites (n = 452). We gave focus to the effects of
demographic variables, physical health constraints (chronic conditions and functional disability), and
psychosocial attributes (sense of mastery, religiosity, social support, and satisfaction with support), along with
their interactive roles. We identified lower education, greater functional disability, lower sense of mastery, and
poorer satisfaction with support as common risk factors for depressive symptoms in both groups; in contrast, the
effects of age, gender, and religiosity were race specific. In addition, we obtained significant interactions among
predictor variables in each group, identifying risk-reducing and risk-enhancing factors within each group.
THE DRAMATIC growth of aging populations coupled
with the increasing proportion of racial or ethnic
minorities prompts the need for research on minority elders.
A particularly urgent social issue lies in the mental health arena.
Compared with the rapidly accumulating research on disparities
in physical health (e.g., Ferraro & Farmer, 1996; Williams &
Collins, 1995), less attention has been paid to racial or ethnic
differences in mental health (Blazer, Landerman, Hays,
Simonsick, & Saunders, 1998; Jackson, Antonucci, & Gibson,
1995; Mills & Edwards, 2002). One line of research has shown
that racial or ethnic minority elders, including older African
Americans, are more vulnerable to depression than their non-
Hispanic White counterparts (e.g., Cochran, Brown, &
McGregor, 1999; Dunlop, Song, Lyons, Manheim, & Chang,
2003). However, the findings are not always consistent, with
some studies suggesting higher rates of depression among
Whites (e.g., Kessler, Mickelson, & Williams, 1999; Turnbull
& Mui, 1995) and others finding no racial differences (e.g.,
Blazer et al.; Cummings, Neff, & Husaini, 2003). In part, these
inconclusive findings seem to reflect differences in age range
and composition of the samples, research settings, and the
selected measures for depression.
In the present study we focused on depressive symptoms in
two racial groups: older African Americans and older non-
Hispanic Whites. Given that race is not a simple measure of
genetic or biological distinction but a gross indicator of social
and cultural values and beliefs (Williams, Yu, & Jackson,
1997), an individual's racial group may exert varying degrees
of influence over his or her behavior and psychological well-
being. The extent of this influence depends on factors such
as income, education, and geographic region of origin or
residence, and research suggests that the patterns of presenting
depressive moods and correlates of depressive symptoms may
vary across racial groups (Blazer et al., 1998). This diversity,
in the context of an assessment of risk or protective factors
for depressive symptoms, has to be explored from a cross-
racial perspective.
The present study is guided by a basic stress and coping
model that we modified to incorporate factors sensitive to
cultural differences. Following Lazarus and Folkman (1984,
p. 19), we defined stress as ``a particular relationship between
the person and the environment that is appraised by the person
as taxing or exceeding his or her resources and endangering
well-being.'' Fundamental to this definition is the inclusion of
not only of stressors but also individuals' subjective in-
terpretation of and reaction to potential stressors. Also of
relevance to this definition is the idea that the stressfulness
of a stimulus is determined by individuals' personal resources
(Haley & Jang, 2002). In the process of stress and coping, racial
groups may show differences in the exposure to stressors, the
level of personal resources, and the manifestations of outcomes
of stress.
In studies of older populations, it is generally recognized that
certain demographic characteristics (e.g., being of advanced
age, female gender, unmarried status, and low socioeconomic
status) increase vulnerability to depressive symptoms across all
racial or ethnic groups (Cummings et al., 2003; Turnbull &
Mui, 1995). Declines in physical health are also recognized as
one of the most common concerns and sources of stress among
older populations (Blazer, Moody-Ayers, Craft-Morgan, &
Burchett, 2002; Bruce, 1999). In the present study we
conceptualized physical health constraints, indicated by
chronic conditions and functional disability, as a major stressor
in later years.
A growing body of literature demonstrates that individuals
with positive coping resources are likely to fare well when
faced with stressful life conditions (Haley & Jang, 2002).
Among coping resources, the sense of mastery or a feeling of
control over one's life and environment has received particular
attention (e.g., Pearlin & Schooler, 1978). An impressive body
of literature has demonstrated the beneficial role of sense of
mastery, and there is consensus that sense of mastery is an
indicator of psychological resilience that can facilitate adapta-
tion to changes, overcome negative consequences, and promote
physical and emotional well-being (Jang, Haley, Small, &
Mortimer, 2002; Roberts, Dunkle, & Haug, 1994; Zarit,
Pearlin, & Schaie, 2003). Two other coping resources, which
are of special relevance when studying African American

groups, are religiosity (Koenig, McCullough, & Larson, 2001;
Levin, Chatters, & Taylor, 1995) and social support (Dilworth-
Anderson, & Burton, 1999; George, 1996). Both types of
resources are known to be associated with more positive
emotional states and with more successful efforts to cope with
stress (George; Koenig et al.). However, few researchers have
considered whether the aforementioned psychosocial coping
resources function in the same way and to the same extent in
African Americans and Whites. Given that African American
culture places a strong emphasis on religious engagement
(Cummings et al., 2003; Jang, Graves, Haley, Small, &
Mortimer, 2003; Musick, Koenig, Hays, & Cohen, 1998), the
benefits from religiosity among older African Americans may
be particularly salient.
As a way of exploring within-group variability, we were also
interested in assessing the interactions between the major
stressor being considered (physical health constraints) and cop-
ing resources (psychosocial attributes) in determining depres-
sive symptoms. A sizable body of literature has demonstrated
that the effect of health problems on mental well-being varies
by the level of psychosocial resources. Negative consequences
of diseases and disability have shown to be buffered by a
sense of mastery (Jang et al., 2002; Kempen et al., 1999;
Roberts et al., 1994), religiosity (Koenig et al., 2001; Levin
et al., 1995), and social support (Hays, Steffens, Flint,
Bosworth, & George, 2001; Penninx et al., 1997). Because
age and gender may condition the effects of health constraints
and psychosocial attributes (e.g., Keyes, 2004), we also took
modifications by age and gender into consideration in our pre-
dictive models of depressive symptoms.
Taken together, our purpose in the present study was to
explore determinants of depressive symptoms in African
American and White older adults, conceptualizing physical
health constraints (chronic conditions and functional disability)
as a major stressor and psychosocial attributes (sense of
mastery, religiosity, social support, and satisfaction with
support) as coping resources. We examined racial differences
and within-group variability by testing direct and moderating
effects. An assessment of the unique characteristics of racial
groups and individual variability within each group can help
identify race-specific risk or protective factors for depressive
symptoms and risk-reducing and risk-enhancing factors within
each group.
METHODS
Participants
We selected the individuals for the present analysis from two
methodologically standardized studies of African American and
White older adults. The African American sample came from
the Hillsborough Elder African American Life Study (HEALS)
and the White sample from the Charlotte County Healthy
Aging Study (CCHAS). For the HEALS and the CCHAS,
individuals were recruited from randomly selected blocks of
two U.S. census tracts each in Hillsborough and Charlotte
County, Florida. The samples included community-dwelling
individuals between the ages of 60 and 84 years. More detailed
information on the studies and sampling procedures can be
found in elsewhere (Jang et al., 2003; Small et al., 2000;
Webb, 2001).
Among the 424 HEALS and 808 CCHAS individuals with
whom contact could be established, 255 (60.1%) HEALS
subjects and 466 (57.7%) CCHAS subjects agreed to participate
in the interviews. We excluded individuals whose race was
identified as non-White in the CCHAS and those who had
missing information in more than 10% of the variables, leaving
255 for analysis in the African American sample and 452 in
the White sample.
Measures
Outcome variable (depressive symptoms). --The Geriatric
Depression Scale­Short Form (GDS-SF; Sheikh & Yesavage,
1986) was used to assess depressive symptoms. Using a yes­no
format, respondents rated 15 items (e.g., ``Do you feel your life
is empty?'' and ``Are you in good spirits mostly?''). Scores on
the GDS-SF ranged from 0 (no depressive symptoms) to 15
(severe depressive symptoms). A score of 5 and above is
suggested as indicative of a probable depression (Sheikh &
Yesavage). Cronbach's alpha for the scale was acceptable to
satisfactory (a ¼ 0.60 for the African American sample; a ¼
0.77 for the White sample).
Major stressor (physical health constraints). --Chronic
conditions were measured with a checklist that asked
respondents whether a doctor had ever told them that they
had specific diseases or conditions such as heart disease, high
blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, cancer, and arthritis. We used
a total count of diseases and conditions in the analyses.
Functional disability was measured with 17 items drawn
from the Activities of Daily Living list (Katz, 1983), the
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living list (Lawton & Brody,
1969), the Physical Performance Scale (Nagi, 1976), and the
Functional Health Scale (Rosow & Breslau, 1966). Respond-
ents were asked whether they had difficulty in performing each
of the activities on the list. The potential range of total scores
was 0 (no difficulty on any item) to 17 (difficulty on all items).
Cronbach's alpha for the scale was high (a ¼ 0.85 for the
African American sample, a ¼ 0.84 for the White sample).
Coping resources (psychosocial attributes). --Sense of
mastery was measured with the Pearlin and Schooler Mastery
Scale (1978). The seven items included statements such as ``I
cannot solve my problems'' and ``My future mostly depends on
me,'' and we scored each on a 4-point scale. Scores on the
mastery scale range from 7 (low mastery) to 28 (high mastery).
Cronbach's alpha for this scale was acceptable to satisfactory
(a ¼ 0.67 for the African American sample; a ¼ 0.78 for the
White sample).
Religiosity was measured with four items that covered
service attendance, religious comfort, importance of religious
faith, and frequency of prayer or meditation. Cronbach's alpha
for the scale based on these four items was shown to be
satisfactory in both groups (a ¼ 0.75 for the African American
sample, a ¼ 0.83 for the White sample). The properties
and utility of the scale were reported in a previous study (Jang
et al., 2003).

Social support and satisfaction with support were measured
with a composite measure from the work of Krause and
Borawski-Clark (1995). Individuals were asked to report how
often they received various types of support, including
instrumental support (such as help with chores), informational
support (such as sharing suggestions and information), and
emotional support (such as having others listen and show
interest). In addition, respondents were asked to report how
satisfied they were with the instrumental, informational, and
emotional support they received. Cronbach's alphas for social
support and satisfaction with support were acceptable to high
(a ¼ 0.86 and a ¼ 0.61 for the African American sample;
a ¼ 0.87 and a ¼ 0.68 for the White sample, respectively).
Demographic variables. --Demographic information in-
cluded age (in years), gender (À1 ¼ male, 1 ¼ female), race
(À1 ¼ African American, 1 ¼ White), marital status (À1 ¼ not
married, 1 ¼ married), and education (in years).
RESULTS
Characteristics of the Participants
Results of descriptive analyses comparing the two samples
are shown in Table 1. The 255 African American older adults
and 452 White older adults had comparable gender distribu-
tions, but they differed in other demographic characteristics.
The African American individuals were significantly younger,
less likely to be currently married, and had lower educational
attainment than the White individuals.
There were no differences in the number of chronic health
conditions reported, but the White participants reported greater
levels of functional disability. African American older adults
scored lower in their sense of mastery, but their scores on
religiosity, social support, and satisfaction with support were
consistently higher than those of Whites. Results based on the
GDS-SF indicated that African Americans reported more
symptoms than Whites, and the difference remained significant
after we controlled for age, gender, and marital status [F(4, 695)
¼ 10.6, p , .001]. In contrast, when using the recommended
cutoff point of 5 (Sheikh & Yesavage, 1986), we found that the
two groups were relatively equal; approximately 10% of the
African American sample and 9% of the White sample fell into
the category of probable depression.
Assessment of the Cross-Racial Comparability of
the GDS-SF
One question of concern in research across racial or ethnic
groups has to do with whether various groups respond to
a standard instrument in the same way. To assess the
comparability of the GDS-SF between African American and
White participants, we ran separate principal component factor
analyses of the GDS-SF with varimax rotation. Each of the two
analyses yielded a four-factor solution, explaining 53.3% and
52.6% of the variance respectively. We quantified the com-
parability of the two factor matrices by calculating congruence
coefficients between the rotated factors of each group in the
same order (Gorsuch, 1974). Congruence coefficients for the
four factors were 0.90, 0.78, 0.99, and 0.96 respectively, with
an overall congruence coefficient of 0.91. Given that the values
greater than 0.90 conventionally indicate factor invariance
(Gorsuch), these results suggest that the GDS-SF is, on the
whole, a comparable measure across the African American and
White samples.
Regression Models of Depressive Symptoms in
African Americans and Whites
Table 2 summarizes the results of the hierarchical regression
models for depressive symptoms. In a preliminary analysis, we
assessed bivariate correlations and variance inflation factor
(VIF) statistics to understand the underlying associations
among study variables and to detect multicollinearity. For each
racial group, we then estimated a separate regression model
with the same sets of predictors entered in the following order:
(a) demographic variables, (b) major stressors (chronic con-
ditions and functional disability), and (c) coping resources
(sense of mastery, religiosity, social support, and satisfaction
with support). In addition to the direct effect model, interactions
between physical health constraints and psychosocial attributes
(eight terms) and modifications by age (six terms) and gender
(six terms) were tested as a final step. To maintain a sufficient
ratio between the number of subjects and predictor variables
entered in the regression model, we entered each interaction
term independently. The interaction terms that reached sta-
tistical significance are presented in Table 2. In computing
interaction terms, we used centered scores to avoid multi-
collinearity between direct effects and interaction terms.
Both samples of individuals showed a significant increment
in the amount of variance explained in each step of the
hierarchical regression models. The total amount of variance
accounted for by the estimated direct effect model was 43% in
the African American sample [F(10, 233)¼17.1, p , .001] and
34% in the White sample [F(10, 364) ¼ 18.5, p , .001]. The
common significant predictors of depressive symptoms across
the two groups included lower education, greater functional
disability, lower sense of mastery, and poorer satisfaction with
support. We found gender and religiosity to be significant
predictors only in the African American sample. We obtained
a significant association between age and depressive symptoms
only in the White sample. The findings imply a particular

vulnerability to depressive symptoms among female African
Americans and Whites of advanced age, and a particular benefit
of religiosity among African Americans.
Modifications Within Each Racial Group
The test of a moderating effect is designed to evaluate whether
the impact of an independent variable on depressive symptoms is
altered (e.g., strengthened or weakened) by a third (moderating)
condition. In subsequent analyses with 20 possible interaction
terms, we obtained statistical significance in the African
American sample for Gender 3 Sense of mastery, Gender 3
Religiosity, Chronic conditions 3 Sense of mastery, and
Functional disability 3 Sense of mastery. In the White sample,
we found significant interactions for Age3Functional disability
and Functional disability 3 Sense of mastery. For further
investigation of the significant interactions, we stratified each
sample into subgroups based on the moderating factors, and we
compared the correlations between predictive variables and
depressive symptoms in the subgroups by using Fisher's r-to-z
transformation, a statistical method to determine the difference
between independent correlation coefficients (Steiger, 1980).
Table 3 summarizes analyses with the African American
sample. The correlation between sense of mastery and
depressive symptoms was stronger in women than in men,
and the difference in coefficients was statistically significant.
We found a similar pattern for religiosity; the association
between religiosity and depressive symptoms in women was
greater than it was in men, although these differences were not
statistically significant. When we divided the African American
sample into low and high groups based on the median score of
sense of mastery (20), the low-mastery group presented a strong
correlation coefficient of depressive symptoms with chronic
conditions and with functional disability. However, the high-
mastery group did not show any significant association of
depressive symptoms with chronic conditions and functional
disability. The differences between the coefficients in the low-
and high-mastery groups were statistically significant.
As shown in Table 4, for the White sample, the older
group (aged 75 and older) showed a stronger association
between functional disability and depressive symptoms than
did the younger group, and the difference was statistically
significant. The low-mastery group (scores below 22) also
showed a stronger coefficient between functional disability and
depressive symptoms than did the high-mastery group, and the

DISCUSSION
In the present study we assessed the determinants of mental
well-being, using community samples of African American and
White older adults. Drawing on a stress and coping model
(Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), we conceptualized physical health
constraints as a major stressor, a variety of psychosocial at-
tributes as coping resources, and depressive symptoms as an
outcome. Our purposes in the present analyses were (a) to
identify similarities and differences in the determinants of de-
pressive symptoms across the racial groups and (b) to explore
within-group variability by testing direct and moderating
effects of demographic variables, physical health constraints,
and psychosocial attributes.
From a sociodemographic perspective, the two samples were
significantly different in terms of the proportion of individuals
who were married and the educational level that the individuals
had attained. These differences mirror the underlying socio-
demographic differences manifest at state and federal levels,
where older African Americans exhibit lower educational
attainment and are less likely than Whites to be married (e.g.,
Ferraro & Farmer, 1996; Williams & Collins, 1995; Williams
et al., 1997).
The preliminary investigation addressed the issue of
measurement comparability of the GDS-SF. When making
comparisons between groups representing potentially different
sociocultural backgrounds, we find that it is essential to ensure
that a test measures the same underlying construct without
cultural biases. This issue is particularly salient when an
instrument initially developed among Whites is applied to
African Americans or other racial or ethnic groups (Gallo,
Cooper-Patrick, & Lesikar, 1998; Neighbors & Jackson, 1996).
A number of studies have applied the GDS to African
American samples and verified its psychometric quality (e.g.,
Espiritu et al., 2001; Harralson et al., 2002). However, the
comparability of the GDS response patterns between Whites
and African Americans has rarely been considered (Mui,
Burnette, & Chen, 2002). In the present study, we empirically
addressed the issue by comparing GDS-SF factor structures
between the racial groups. The high overall congruence
coefficient obtained in the present investigation indicates that
the instrument was comparable at least for the two samples
being considered. This latter finding established the appropri-
ateness of further comparative analyses.
In subsequent analyses, African American older adults were
shown to endorse significantly more depressive symptoms than
their White counterparts, and this finding is consistent with
studies showing a greater vulnerability to mental health
problems among minority elders (e.g., Cochran et al., 1999;
Dunlop et al., 2003). In contrast, the two groups were strikingly
similar in the majority of factors identified as predictors of
depressive symptoms. In both groups, lower education was
connected to the higher levels of depressive symptoms, and
functional disability was shown to be a significant health-
related stressor. Among the variety of coping resources exam-
ined, sense of mastery and satisfaction with support reached
statistical significance in both groups. These results parallel
previous research findings on risk factors (e.g., low socioeco-
nomic status and poor physical health status) and protective
factors (e.g., sense of mastery and social resources) for depres-
sive symptoms across diverse populations (Blazer et al., 2002;
Cummings et al., 2003; George, 1996; Jang et al., 2002;
Roberts et al., 1994; Turnbull & Mui, 1995). Our findings also
are consistent with the literature showing the greater signifi-
cance of functional disability in comparison with chronic con-
ditions (Zeiss, Lewinsohn, Rohde, & Seeley, 1996) and of the
perceived quality of support versus the quantity or frequency
of support (Dilworth-Anderson & Burton, 1999; George) in
determining emotional well-being.
We also identified several group-specific predictors of
depressive symptoms. Only among Whites was advanced age
a risk factor for depressive symptoms, and among African
Americans being female and being less religious represented
risk factors. The latter relationship, which can also be described
as an association of religiosity with well-being, has been
demonstrated in other studies of African American elders (e.g.,
Cummings et al., 2003; Jang et al., 2003; Musick et al., 1998).
The reason for this association has yet to be explicated, but
possible mechanisms for the function of religiosity include
buffering the adverse effects of life stresses, strengthening
cognitive coping abilities, aiding people in finding meaning in
the face of adversity, and increasing social connectivity
(Koenig et al., 2001; Levin et al., 1995; Musick et al.).
Our findings emphasize the need to evaluate the particular
role of religiosity among African Americans. A strong
emphasis on religious engagement has often been reported in
studies of African Americans and has been viewed as
a representation of their cultural identity (Koenig et al., 2001;
Levin et al., 1995). Results suggested that religious beliefs may
provide African American elders with psychological resilience
against adversities. This finding expands on previous research
showing that African Americans not only have a greater level of
religious engagement but also enjoy a comparatively significant
benefit from it. However, the power of faith may have its
downside. The present results suggest that African Americans
who run counter to the norm by exhibiting low religiosity may
be at particular risk, and mental health professionals may not
recognize this risk if they lack familiarity with the role of
religiosity in the African American community. Moreover,
even very religious African Americans may feel stigmatized by
mental health problems. Empirical studies have shown that
African Americans are more likely to perceive depression as
personal weakness (Mills, Alea, & Cheong, 2004) and may use
negative religious coping such as redefining a situation as
punishment from divine sources or as a weakness in faith
(Pargament, Koenig, & Perez, 2000). As a common saying in
the African American community goes, ``The Lord won't put
more on me than I can bear.'' Clearly, the association of the
religious experience with mental health and illness among
African American elders is complex, and the findings of the
present study can do little other than invite further research. The
results do suggest that strategies to utilize religious coping in
a positive way to promote mental well-being should be sought.
In addition to the direct effect model, we tested interactions
among predictive variables to explore within-group variability
and identify risk-reducing and risk-enhancing factors in each
group. We found the involvement of religiosity and sense of
RACIAL VARIATIONS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS P317
mastery with depressive symptoms to be more complex among
the African American participants. For the latter, the associa-
tion between mastery and religiosity with mental health was
stronger among women than men. These findings suggest that
African American women may be particularly likely to respond
to interventions designed to strengthen or sustain their sense of
mastery and religiosity.
One of the key findings from this study is that, in both
samples, a sense of mastery not only directly predicted
depressive symptoms but also had significant interactions with
functional disability. The finding is consistent with the literature
showing the significant roles of sense of mastery in buffering
negative consequences of physical health problems and
protecting mental health outcomes (e.g., Jang et al., 2002;
Kempen et al., 1999; Roberts et al., 1994). Given that most of
the previous findings are based on information from White
participants, it is notable that in the present study we found the
same pattern of modification among African American older
adults. We also found the buffering role of sense of mastery for
chronic conditions in the African American sample but not in
the White sample.
In the White sample, the negative effects of functional
disability on mental well-being were shown to be greater
among individuals of advanced age. This finding suggests that
a combination of older age and having disabilities can markedly
reduce mental well-being. It is notable that the interactive role
of age and disability was only observed among White older
adults. These results can be considered in light of cultural
values and beliefs regarding aging. On one hand, among
Whites, whose cultural values are oriented on independence
and youth, the experiences of growing old and having
functional difficulties may be more likely to be perceived as
declines or losses and have more debilitating effects on
emotional well-being. On the other hand, African Americans,
who are reported to have more favorable perspectives on aging
and the aged and to be more resilient against adversities in the
later years of life (e.g., Gibson, 1993; Johnson, 1995; Williams
et al., 1997), have attenuated negative effects with regard to
advanced age and mental health. It is also notable that the
African Americans included in the present study represent
a cohort that survived the era of racial segregation and
inequality. The sociohistorical experiences shared by this
cohort may have collectively influenced their beliefs and
attitudes, and in particular may have provided them an
opportunity to develop psychological resilience and strength
(Mills & Edwards, 2002).
Because we used geographically defined samples and a cross-
sectional study design, we cannot generalize the findings to the
national level or draw causal inferences. It should also be noted
that the present analysis only included objective indicators of
health-related stressors such as the existence of disease and
disability, without considering perceived difficulties or stressful-
ness from those conditions. Given the importance of subjective
appraisals in stress and coping models, future studies should
address racial variations in appraisals of the stressful life
conditions and their consequences in mental health. In addition,
by including younger individuals, future studies can address
cohort or generational differences in mental health across racial
groups. Because the overall reliability coefficients of the multi-
item scales were lower among African Americans compared
with those among Whites, further research on the issues of
psychometric qualities and cross-group equivalence would
appear useful. The results may be idiosyncratic to the present
study or may reflect a larger phenomenon.
Despite these limitations, the present study was able to
address the relevance of stress and coping factors for late life
depression from a cross-racial perspective. Our findings on
racial differences and within-group variability provide insights
to guide prevention or intervention strategies for the mental
well-being of populations with diverse backgrounds. For White
older adults, psychosocial and educational interventions to alter
negative perceptions of aging may be useful to facilitate positive
adaptation to the changes and challenges with aging. The
particular benefit of religiosity among African American older
adults deserves attention and has to be utilized when social
services and programs are designed. Utilization of community
resources through religious organizations is strongly encouraged
in African American communities. The interventions to preserve
and promote personal feelings of mastery will be beneficial to
older individuals regardless of their racial orientations. The
identification and utilization of psychosocial attributes amenable
to specific racial groups may increase the cultural competence
and effectiveness of social services and programs.
