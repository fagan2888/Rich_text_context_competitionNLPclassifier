The World Health Organization predicts that depression will
be the second leading cause of burden on society among all
diseases worldwide by the year 2020 (ref. 1). Depression is
also an established risk factor for the disease predicted to be
the leading cause of societal burden, ischemic heart 
disease.1
Depression has been shown to increase the risk for the

development of cardiovascular disease2 in healthy subjects, and
for cardiac morbidity and mortality in subjects with established
cardiovascular disease.3,4 One of the most important modifia-
ble risk factors for cardiovascular disease is hypertension, and
depression has been found to be associated cross-
sectionally
with the prevalence of hypertension5,6 and longitudinally
with the incidence of hypertension.7,8 A number of mecha-
nisms have been proposed by which depression could lead to
hypertension, including increased hypothalamic­
pituitary­
adrenal axis reactivity,8 elevated sympathetic nervous system
activity,9,10 shared genetic susceptibility,11 increased propen-
sity for unhealthy lifestyles such as physical inactivity, smok-
ing, and alcohol abuse,12 and comorbidity with obstructive
sleep apnea13 and the metabolic syndrome.14
Short sleep duration and insomnia, which are typical symp-
toms of depression, could also be mechanisms by which
depression plays a role in the etiology of hypertension. Short

Background
Depression has been found to predict the incidence of hypertension
and other adverse cardiovascular events in prospective studies.
Insomnia and short sleep duration, which are typical symptoms
of depression, have also been shown to increase the risk for
hypertension incidence. Insomnia is associated with increased
activation of the hypothalamic­pituitary­adrenal axis, and short
sleep duration raises average 24-h blood pressure, which over time
could lead to structural adaptations that gradually reset the entire
cardiovascular system to operate at an elevated pressure equilibrium.
No previous published population studies have examined whether
insomnia and sleep duration mediate the relationship between
depression and hypertension incidence.
Methods
Weconductedmultivariatelongitudinal(1982­1992)analysesstratified

(NHANESI)(n=4,913)usingCoxproportionalhazardsmodels.
Results
Middle-aged subjects who suffered from depression at baseline
were 44% more likely to be diagnosed with hypertension over
the follow-up period after controlling for covariates (hazard ratio
(HR) = 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15­1.80). Both short
sleep duration and insomnia were also significantly associated
with hypertension incidence. Consistent with insomnia and
sleep duration acting as mediators of the relationship between
depression and hypertension incidence, the inclusion of these
variables in the multivariate models appreciably attenuated
the association (HR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.00­1.61). Depression, sleep
duration, and insomnia were not significantly associated with
hypertension incidence in elderly subjects.
Conclusions
These results suggest the hypothesis that treatment of sleep
problems in middle-aged individuals suffering from depression
could reduce their risk for developing hypertension, and its vascular
and cardiac complications.

sleep duration and insomnia have been found to be 
associated
with the prevalence of hypertension in cross-sectional
studies15,16 and the incidence of hypertension in longitudi-
nal studies.17,18 Sleep restriction has been shown to acutely
increase blood pressure and sympathetic nervous system
activity.19 Blood pressure dips by an average of 10­20% during
sleep, so shorter sleep durations increase hemodynamic load
by raising average 24-h blood pressure and heart rate, which
over time can lead to structural adaptations that gradually
reset the entire 
cardiovascular system to operate at an elevated
pressure equilibrium.20 Sleep restriction has also been shown
to compromise insulin sensitivity,21 and to increase appe-
tite by decreasing leptin and increasing ghrelin.22 Short sleep
duration is associated with diabetes incidence23 and obesity,24
potent risk factors for hypertension. Despite known connec-
tions between sleep parameters and hypertension, no previous
epidemiological studies have explored whether sleep duration
and insomnia act as mediators in the relationship between
depression and hypertension.
Knowledge of whether there are mediating effects of sleep
duration and insomnia on the relationship between depres-
sion and hypertension could lead to the development of
interventions to decrease the excess cardiovascular morbid-
ity and mortality associated with depression. In this study, we
explored the relationship between depression and hyperten-
sion incidence between 1982 and 1992 among participants
in the Epidemiologic Follow-up Studies of the First National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I).25
Methods
Participants. Subjects for this study were participants in the
1982­1984, 1986, 1987, and 1992 follow-up studies of the
NHANES I.25 The baseline measures of depression, sleep dura-
tion, insomnia, and covariates were taken from the 1982­1984
survey, and then hypertension incidence was determined until
1992. The NHANES I survey was a probability sample of the
civilian noninstitutionalized US population between 1971 and
1975. Approximately 85% of the subjects between the ages of
25 and 74 at baseline were successfully traced and interviewed
in 1982­1984 (n = 12,220). Individuals who were deceased
(n = 1,697), who had hypertension at or before the 1982­1984
survey (n = 5,192), who did not answer any of the depression
questions (n = 237), and who did not answer all of the sleep
questions (n = 181) were excluded from the analyses, yielding
a final sample size of 4,913 subjects. All subjects gave informed
consent. This study involved analyses of a publicly available
dataset that did not include identifying information and, there-
fore, met federal guidelines for exemption from review by an
institutional review board.
Measures.Theprimarydependentvariableforthisstudywasthe
incidence of hypertension between 1982 and 1992. Individuals
who had systolic blood pressure readings >140mmHg or
diastolic readings >90mmHg at the time of the 1982­1984
survey or who had been diagnosed with hypertension at or
before the 1982­1984 survey were excluded. Three blood pres-
sure readings were taken at the same sitting, and readings
were not taken if maximum inflation level was >160mmHg
as specified by the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up
Program.26 Incident cases of hypertension were determined by
self-report of physician diagnosis, by hospital diagnosis, or by
cause of death at the times of the 1986, 1987, or 1992 follow-up
surveys.
The primary independent variable for this study was depres-
sion. To measure the presence of depressive symptoms, we
used the standard cutoff score of 16 out of a total possible score
of 60 on the 20-question CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale).27 Of the 89 subjects who reported
taking antidepressants, 44 had scores on the CES-D in the
nondepressed range. We included subjects taking antidepres-
sants in the depressed category.
We tested the hypothesis that baseline sleep duration and
insomnia would act as mediators of the relationship between
the independent variable of baseline depression and the
dependent variable of hypertension incidence. The subject's
average sleep duration in hours was determined by their
responses to the question: "How many hours of sleep do you
usually get a night (or when you usually sleep)?" We cat-
egorized the sleep duration variable (5, 6, 7­8, and 9h) as
opposed to retaining it as a continuous variable because each
additional hour of sleep was not associated with the same
change in the dependent variable. Subjects were asked three
questions about how often they had trouble falling asleep, wak-
ing up during the night, and waking up too early and not being
able to fall asleep again with responses including "1 = never,"
"2 = rarely," "3 = sometimes," "4 = often," and "5 = almost

pulse rate (continuous). Missing values for covariates, which
for all covariates represented <1% of the total sample size, were
imputed using mean and mode substitution.
Statistical analyses. After preliminary univariate and bivariate
analyses, we used Cox proportional hazards models to exam-
ine the effect of depression on the risk of being diagnosed with
hypertension over follow-up. The time duration to diagnosis
was determined from the baseline date to the first report of
hypertension. The first adjusted model (Model 2) included
multiple covariates. To test whether sleep duration and insom-
nia acted as mediators in the relationship between depression
and hypertension incidence, we included these variables sepa-
rately in Models 3 and 4, and then together in Model 5. The
significance of individual coefficients was determined by the
95% confidence limits for hazard ratios (HRs).
We theorized that the mediating effects of sleep duration and
insomnia on the relationship between depression and hyper-
tension incidence would differ by age because age has been
shown to act as an effect modifier in the relationship between
sleep duration and hypertension incidence with associations
in middle-aged subjects but not in elderly subjects.17 To test
whether there would be differences between middle-aged and
elderly adults in the mediating effects of sleep duration and
insomnia, we divided the sample into two age-groups with
subjects who, at the time of the 1982­1984 wave, were between
the ages of 32 and 59 years in one group and subjects who
were between the ages of 60 and 86 years in another group. We
tested for interaction between depression and all covariates.
The NHANES I included weights to account for the complex
sampling design and to allow approximations of the US popu-
lation. We conducted both nonweighted analyses using SAS
software (SAS System for Windows, version 9.1; SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) and weighted analyses using SUDAAN software
(release 10.0; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, NC). We chose to present only the unweighted results
for four reasons. First, the unweighted results were generally
consistent with minimal effects of the complex survey design
on the main conclusions derived from the weighted estimates.
Second, our objective was not to provide national estimates,
but to look at the potential mediating effects of sleep dura-
tion and insomnia on the relationship between depression and
hypertension incidence. Third, our study's baseline measures
were taken from the 1982­1984 follow-up to the NHANES I,
so the weights created for baseline measures taken from the
1971­1975 NHANES I did not account for subjects who were
lost to follow-up between the two waves. Fourth, there have
been differences of opinion regarding the appropriateness of
using the sample weights with the NHANES.28
Results
We found sleep duration to act as an effect modifier in the
relationship between depression and hypertension incidence
in middle-aged subjects (P = 0.05). In middle-aged subjects,
the presence of depression, and either short or long sleep dura-
tion was associated with a higher incidence of hypertension
(Figure 1). None of the interaction terms between 
depression
and the other covariates were significant. Tables 1 and 2 show
the results from bivariate analyses. Depression and hyperten-
sion incidence were both associated with short and long sleep
durations, non-Caucasian race/ethnicity, low education, obes-
ity, diabetes, alcohol abstinence, physical inactivity, higher
insomnia scores, and higher pulse rate. Depression was also
associated with hypertension incidence, female sex, age 70,
underweight obese body weights, and increased cigarette
smoking, whereas hypertension incidence was also associ-
ated with age 80. Both short and long sleep durations were
associated with older age, non-Caucasian ethnicity, low edu-
cation, alcohol abstinence, and low physical activity. Short
sleep duration was associated with overweight and obese body
weights, diabetes, and increased cigarette smoking. Higher
insomnia scores were associated with increasing age, female
sex, Caucasian ethnicity, low education, diabetes, alcohol
abstinence, decreased cigarette smoking, and lower physical
activity.
Table 3 shows the hazards ratios of being diagnosed with
hypertension over follow-up. There were 663 total incident
cases of hypertension over this period. The relationships
between depression, sleep duration, insomnia, and hyperten-
sion incidence differed between middle-aged and elderly sub-
jects. Among middle-aged subjects, those who suffered from
depression were significantly more likely (Model 1, HR = 1.65,
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33­2.05) to have been diag-
nosed with hypertension over the follow-up period, and these
results were attenuated with the inclusion of the covariates in
Model 2 (HR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.15­1.80). Consistent with our
hypothesis that sleep duration and insomnia would act as
mediators of the relationship between depression and hyper-
tension incidence, the inclusion of sleep duration and insom-
nia together in Model 5 appreciably attenuated the association
(Model 5, HR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.00­1.61) with the preponder-
ance of the change attributable to insomnia. In fully adjusted
models, subjects who reported sleeping 5h per night were
50% more likely (HR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.11­2.02) to have been
diagnosed with hypertension over the follow-up period than

subjects who reported sleeping 7­8h per night, and for each
one unit increase in the insomnia score, the odds of being
diagnosed with hypertension over the follow-up period
increased by 5% (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.01­1.09). Depression,
sleep duration, and insomnia were not significantly associated
with hypertension incidence in elderly subjects.
Discussion
We found depression to increase the risk for hypertension
incidence, and our results are consistent with insomnia, and to
a lesser extent, sleep duration acting as mediators of this rela-
tionship in middle-aged subjects. We found significant asso-
ciations between the exposures of depression, insomnia, and
sleep duration, and the outcome of hypertension incidence
only in middle-aged subjects and not in elderly subjects. There
are a number of potential explanations for the different rela-
tionships found in middle-aged and elderly subjects. First,
short sleep duration has been found to be more strongly asso-
ciated with hypertension incidence17 and obesity24 in middle-
aged subjects than in elderly subjects. Second, advanced age is
associated with changes in sleep architecture with increased
difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep,29 so differences in
sleep parameters between depressed and nondepressed elderly
subjects would be less marked than for middle-aged subjects.
Third, depression has been found in elderly subjects to be asso-
ciated with systolic hypotension30 and a lowering of systolic
blood pressure over time.31 One recent cross-sectional study
with adult subjects (ages 18­65) found depression to be associ-
ated with lower systolic blood pressure and a lower prevalence
of isolated systolic hypertension,32 but the authors did not test
for interaction by age or conduct analyses stratified by age,
so it is likely that the associations they found were weighted
by lower systolic blood pressures in elderly subjects suffering
from depression. Combined systolic and diastolic hyperten-
sion is common in middle-aged hypertensive patients, whereas
isolated systolic hypertension accounts for over 60% of hyper-
tension in elderly populations,33 so the lack of an association
between depression and hypertension in elderly subjects in
our study could be due to the specific influences of depression
on systolic blood pressure in elderly subjects.

original contributions Depression and Hypertension Mediated by Sleep
Middle-aged subjects who suffered from depression were
65% more likely to be diagnosed with hypertension over the
follow-up period. Controlling for covariates partially attenu-
ated the relationship. The relationship was then further atten-
uated after controlling for sleep duration, so the influence of
depression on hypertension incidence is likely to be related
in part to the effects of sleep duration on blood pressure. Our
findings that both short and long sleep durations are associ-
ated with depression are consistent with the fact that insomnia
and hypersomnia are symptoms of depression that can directly
affect sleep duration. We found short, but not long, sleep dura-
tion to be associated with hypertension incidence. Chronic
short sleep durations could result in prolonged exposure to
raised 24-h blood pressure and heart rate that could entrain
the cardiovascular system to operate at a higher pressure
equilibrium through structural adaptations, such as arterial
and left ventricular hypertrophic remodeling.20 The relation-
ship between depression and hypertension incidence was also
attenuated with the inclusion of insomnia in the multivari-
ate models, so insomnia could also be on the causal pathway
between depression and hypertension. Insomnia could con-
tribute toward hypertension through increased activation
of the hypothalamic­pituitary­adrenal axis34 and through
less pronounced nocturnal fall in systolic and diastolic blood
pressure.35
Short sleep duration and insomnia are different, yet related
entities. Insomnia entails dissatisfaction with the quality of
sleep and an inability to sleep given adequate opportunity.
Insomnia can result in short sleep duration, but individu-
als with short sleep duration do not necessarily suffer from
insomnia. They may sleep less because they choose to do so
or because they lack the opportunity to sleep. In the final mul-
tivariate model that included both sleep duration and insom-
nia, both short sleep duration and insomnia were significantly
associated with hypertension incidence. The hazards ratios for
both short sleep duration and insomnia were attenuated when
they were included together in the final multivariate model,
indicating their influence upon one another's ability to affect
hypertension incidence.
Adjustment for sleep duration and insomnia reduced the
strength of the association between depression and hyperten-
sion incidence by 33% (Model 2  = 0.36, Model 5  = 0.24).
The ability of covariates, such as body weight, diabetes, and
physical activity, to reduce the strength of the association
between depression and hypertension incidence could also be
partially attributable to the effects of sleep duration and insom-
nia on these covariates. Sleep duration has been linked to dia-
betes and obesity in both experimental21,22 and epidemiologic
studies.23,24 Feeling tired from inadequate sleep could lessen
one's desire to engage in physical activity.
Although the results from this study are consistent with the
hypothesis that insomnia, and to a lesser extent sleep dura-
tion, act as mediators of the relationship between depression
and hypertension incidence, a number of limitations to these
analyses must be considered as well. Statistical analyses alone
cannot distinguish between mediation and confounding, and
although strong arguments can be made that sleep 
disturbances
represent a causal mechanism by which depression increases
the risk for hypertension incidence, it is possible that sleep dis-
turbances are associated with some other unmeasured mecha-
nisms. Sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, have been shown
to be associated with both depression and hypertension inci-
dence, so the presence of these disorders could have played a
part in our results. The NHANES I follow-up survey did not
include questions on sleep disorders, but we would expect
that individuals with sleep apnea would be more likely to
self-
report longer sleep durations because they are often una-
ware of their disrupted sleep patterns and require more sleep
to compensate for poor sleep quality. The prevalence of sleep
apnea in patients with insomnia has been found to be only 6%
(ref. 36), so it is unlikely that sleep apnea played a large role
in our results. Another limitation of the study is the lack of
repeated measures of depression, sleep duration, and insom-
nia over the follow-up period. Changes in these variables over
follow-up could have affected the results. Hypertension also
frequently goes undiagnosed, and we have no way of knowing
whether subjects suffering from depression, short sleep dura-
tion, and insomnia were more or less likely than subjects with-
out these conditions to seek or receive treatment, and therefore
to be diagnosed with hypertension. Other limitations include
possible bias arising from lost to follow-up and missing data
on baseline risk variables.
The results from this study are consistent with the hypoth-
esis that insomnia and sleep duration play roles in the etiol-
ogy of hypertension in middle-aged individuals suffering
from depression, suggesting that interventions that increase
the amount and improve the quality of sleep could potentially
serve as treatments and as primary preventative measures for
hypertension in these individuals. Behavioral interventions
could include assistance with implementing sleep hygiene
practices and with modifying maladaptive sleep habits.
