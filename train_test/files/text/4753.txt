Introduction
The Second Congo War in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (The Congo) has been the largest humanitarian crisis
in the last two decades. Over five million people have died
and millions more have been displaced in what some com-
mentators have called "Africa's First World War" (see Cook,
2010). The war began in August 1998 as a combined
Rwandan and Ugandan attempt to oust their former pupil the
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, whom they brought to
power in 1996. However, that alliance ended in acrimony
and bitterness, and eventually war. What complicated inter-
national attempts to end the Congolese conflict were the
competing narratives of why the war started. Washington
backed Rwandan and Ugandan claims of border security, and
that the Congo was experiencing an internal civil war. Kabila,
on the other hand claimed, and this was backed up by France
that the war was a clear Rwandan and Ugandan violation of
Congolese sovereignty. By 1999, the international commu-
nity got everyone to sit down in Lusaka, Zambia, to create an
underfunded and undermanned United Nations (UN)
Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (MONUC). The war eventually came to a sputtering
end after the assassination of Kabila by one of his body-
guards in January of 2001.1
The Second Congo War provides us with a case study for
testing theories of media framing. Most American scholarly
studies of media and foreign policy have focused on places
where the United States actively put boots on the ground
(e.g., Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq) or should have (Rwanda).
Second, it has often been argued thatAmerican media (and in
effect all media) indexes their reporting to support
Washington's foreign policy. The old adage that politics
stops at the water's edge applied to the press as well. Robert
Entman (2004) argues that the end of the Cold War weak-
ened the "journalists'habit of deference" (i.e., indexing), and
they became critical of President Clinton's humanitarian
missions because they could (p. 107). This article hopes to
add to the literature of the connections between media and
American foreign policy after the Cold War in four ways.
First, a large component of U.S. participation in UN peace-
keeping is not providing military, but critical humanitarian
and logistical aid. This article hopes to fill that gap in the
literature in how the media covers these events. Second, the
Congo provides us an opportunity to test whether Entman's
theories of the post­Cold War American media are correct.
Third, it is important to provide a comparative perspective to
a study of the American press and the Congo War. The
American press is often seen as parochial and unconcerned

Diamonds and Genocide: American,
British, and French Press Coverage
of the Second Congo War
Christopher R. Cook1
Abstract
The Second Congo War in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (The Congo) has been the largest humanitarian crisis in
the last decade. Over five million people have died, and millions more have been displaced. During the conflict, the ostensibly
neutral United States subtly sided with Rwanda and Uganda at the expense of the Congolese President Laurent Kabila. I
test whether the media indexed their coverage to Washington policy. However, I expand my analysis to compare coverage
leading in British and French newspapers as well. After careful examination, I discover that there is no significant difference in
reporting. However, the real question of bias and framing includes issues of neutrality, the prominence of linking the Second
Congo War with the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and the persistent underreporting of economic exploitation that underpinned
the violence.

with African conflicts. So there is much insight to be gained
by comparing coverage of the Congo in the New York Times
and the Washington Post with two major French newspapers
(Le Figaro and Le Monde) and two major British dailies
(Guardian and London Times). Putting the Congo War in a
comparative press perspective challenges our global under-
standing of indexing. Finally, this paper hopes to make a
small contribution to how Africa is examined in the Western
media. Andrew Breslau (1987) argues that media coverage
of African conflicts has often lacked context, sophistication
and exposition (p. 6). Stories on Africa are full of poverty,
political unrest, primitive war, "ancient tribal hatreds," ter-
rorism, and crime (see Livingstone & Eachus 1999).
To accomplish these goals, this paper is broken up into
several sections. First, I will briefly examine the Second
Congo War and the competing narratives of Rwanda,
Uganda, and Kabila's Congo. I will then explore the subtle
yet real anti-Kabila bias in Washington. Second, this paper
will look at the present literature of media effects of framing
and indexing. It is in this section that we start to define and
explore how to measure media bias in the Congo. If we could
pinpoint possible "frames": first, coverage of the roles
Rwanda and Uganda played in the war; second, the reporting
of genocide and massacres, and whether there was a discus-
sion of a counter genocide perpetuated by Rwanda; and third,
the exploitation of natural resources by all parties. These
three variables will serve as functional proxies of whether a
paper was biased. We will then look at the methodology of
selecting articles and stories and the coding criteria for the
six newspapers selected. By examining coverage from
January of 1998 (8 months before the war began) to Kabila's
untimely death 25 months later, we should be able to com-
pare and contrast the quality and quantity of reporting, and
how different nations framed the same international event.
Finally, we will explore our empirical findings and our theo-
retical conclusions.
Part I: American Policy in the Congo:
Accepting the Rwandan Frame
Before we turn to the literature of politics and media studies,
it is important that we provide a brief case study of the war
and examination of American policy (also see Cook, 2010).
Even though it is an arbitrary date, it might be informative to
start the discussion of the Congo with the Rwandan genocide
in April 1994. That genocide had consequences felt across
the African Great Lakes region. The Hutu perpetuators fled
to neighboring Congo (at the time still called Zaire) along-
side Rwandan Hutus civilians fearing Tutsi retribution. The
Interahamwe and the genocidaires used the bustling and hec-
tic refugee camps to launch border raids on the new Tutsi-led
government. The government of Zaire, led by Mobutu Sese
Seko looked the other way.
Rwanda now had a security issue with its Western neigh-
bor. Kigali's concern with its Zairian-based borders was also
shared by Uganda who were fighting their own cross-border
rebels. Both realized that the situation was not going to
change with Mobutu in power. By 1996 Kampala and Kigali
hammered together an umbrella coalition of various militia
and Congolese rebel groups who were supplemented by their
own armed forces to overthrow Kinshasa. The rebel move-
ment was led by Laurent Kabila, a long-time revolutionary
with socialist, nationalist, and Maoist tendencies (Lumumba-
Kasongo, 2001; McCalpin, 2002). Instead of the American
indifference toward the Rwandan genocide in 1994,
Washington helped train and supply the Rwandan Army and
rebel forces as they advanced on the capital (Duke, 1998).
The Mobutu regime quickly disintegrated. By May 1997,
the rebels captured Kinshasa. The triumphant Kabila
renamed Zaire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Kabila quickly moved to consolidate his power: outlawed
political parties, declared martial law and filled key security
positions with Rwandan Tutsi or those loyal to him. This
included James Kabarebe, a Rwandan Army officer who
became Kabila's Chief of Staff. He had originally promised
free elections which were then postponed indefinitely
(Afoaku, 2002, p. 112). By 1998, Laurent Kabila found him-
self in a difficult domestic situation. Rene Lemarchand
(1999) notes that many Congolese felt that the war of libera-
tion had turned into a Rwandan occupation. Meanwhile, his
authoritarian and economic policies were unpopular domes-
tically and abroad. Furthermore, and ominously, Rwanda and
Uganda (and joined by Burundi) now felt Kabila was not
doing enough to help them fight the Interahamwe and other
rebel groups still operating in the Congolese territory.
Something had to give, and to salvage his crumbling
regime, Kabila decided to remove the foreign influence from
the government first. In July 1998, Kabila asked Rwanda and
Uganda to leave the Congolese territory and fired officers
like Kabarebe. Kampala and Kigali were caught off-guard,
but they quickly improvized a new strategy--They would
just replace Kabila with the Congolese sympathetic to their
needs just as they replaced Mobutu. The Second Congo War
broke out 6 days later. The Rwandan­Ugandan alliance
brought together a coalition of indigenous anti-Kabila
groups, but there was no doubt that the Rwandan Patriotic
Army (RPA) and the Ugandan Army pulled the strings and
formed the military back bone (Rosenblum, 2002).According
to Rwandan and Ugandan narratives, the war was an internal
civil war.
The bid to remove Kabila in a lightening campaign was
thwarted when the governments of Angola, Namibia, and
Zimbabwe came to his rescue. Besides his foreign help
Kabila realized the greatest strength he had with the
Congolese people was not the love of him but the hatred of
the Rwandans. Kabila's narrative of the conflict, which was
accepted by many Congolese and his allies, revolved around
the idea of an external invasion and a violation of Congolese
sovereignty. His regime whipped up anti-Tutsi sentiments
that bordered (but did not cross) on incitement to genocide.
Cook 3
The strategy worked, and by the spring of 1999 the war had
turned into an uncomfortable and deadly stalemate--but
Kabila was still in power. The UN was able to hold cease fire
talks in Lusaka, Zambia, which hammered out an under-
funded and undermanned UN peacekeeping mission
(MONUC), which none of the parties fully accepted.
But a careful analysis of American policy reveals a subtle
but real anti-Kabila bias. The Clinton Administration
accepted the Rwandan­Ugandan frame and treated this con-
flict as an internal civil war and not one of foreign invasion.
Clinton may have inadvertently led Kigali to believe that
such an invasion would have his blessing (Prunier, 2009, p.
195). When it came to interpreting Rwandan actions,
Washington always viewed them through the lens of border
security and the guilt of the genocide they ignored. Rwandan
leader Paul Kagame also worked hard to make sure the West
never forgot their indifference to the events of April 1994.
Washington never cut Laurent Kabila slack. Georges
Nzongola-Ntalaja (2004b) notes that the United States
thought Kabila was erratic and incompetent. In the words of
Gerard Prunier (2009), Kabila was an unrepentant leftist
with a strong distrust of the West. They claimed he was
responsible for 95% of the cases of obstruction in the UN
Mission. His behavior has been an example of the "worst
case behavior . . . an obstacle to deployment" (International
Crisis Group, 2000, p. 78). However, no matter how inept,
corrupt, or disliked Kabila was, many Congolese saw the
new Kigali-backed rebel group (Rally for Congolese
Democracy) as nothing more than a front for a Rwandan
invasion and occupation.
The American bias against Kabila manifests itself in two
areas: First, Kabila was increasingly coming under interna-
tional attack for the human rights violations that occurred
during the First Congo War, including the massacres of Hutu
refugees in 1996 and 1997. The massacres, which the 2010
UN Mapping Report has stated bordered on genocidal, were
actually carried out by Rwandan forces--but Kabila bore the
brunt of the global anger. At first, Kabila stonewalled the UN
to protect his Rwandan allies. But Congolese international
aid and debt relief servicing were threatened over his refusal
to participate in the investigation. So even though the RPF
initiated revenge killings, Rwanda had to never answer for it.
Whereas Congolese aid was tied to Kabila's human rights
record, it was not the case for Rwanda. Kigali continued to
receive a flow of monies from the world community as long
as it gave lip service to good governance and that the money
would not go to the military. In fact Rwandan brutality con-
tinued into the Second War, which further alienated them
from the Congolese population, reinforced them as agents of
an occupation, and delegitimized their own rebel groups.
The second issue of bias concerned the question of natural
resource exploitation. Washington argued that Kabila and his
cronies were selling strategic minerals for personal gain--
which they were. The UN report on exploitation in the Congo
(UN, 2002), for example, was critical of Kabila's role in "the
continuation of the war" in connection to financial incen-
tives. But the same condemnation was not held by the Clinton
Administration for their allies, Rwanda and Uganda. Because
for all the talk of securing borders (which were real enough),
both Rwanda and Uganda were directly benefitting from
Congolese resources as well. In fact, Prunier notes that eco-
nomic exploitation of an occupied Congo was always a fac-
tor for Kigali. Rwanda's embrace of a second war would
resolve the border problem, serve to fix internal dissent, but
just as importantly share the spoils of war among the elite
(Prunier, 2009, p. 195). In the first quarter of 2000, Uganda
and Rwanda became the number one exporters of diamond
and copper in the world market (Lumumba-Kasongo, 2001).
The UN (2002) report suggests that between 1998 and 2000,
about 1,800 trucks carrying logs, timber, coffee, and so on
have been brought out of the Congo to Uganda for re-expor-
tation by Ugandan firms. Rwanda was not much better. The
report also reveals the underlying dynamic within the con-
flict: "because of its lucrative nature, [the Second Congo
War] created a `win­win' situation for all belligerents."
Among this backdrop of resource extraction, the Rwandan­
Ugandan alliance actually broke down as they fought each
over diamonds. It would be difficult to argue that the war was
just about border protection when the two sides were indis-
criminately killing Congolese civilians in the city of
Kisangani over natural resources.
The Second Congo War was complicated, but even if we
posit--and there is good reason to believe so--that the
Clinton Administration legitimately wanted to end the suf-
fering in the name of humanitarianism, they still framed the
conflict through a prism of anti-Kabila bias and Rwandan
and Ugandan security needs. Ending the war meant doing so
on terms favorable to Kampala and Kigali. Washington out-
right rejected Kabila's claims about Congolese sovereignty
and instead favored the narrative of the 1994 genocide and
cross-border rebels. They did not question the Rwanda's role
in genocidal reprisal killings after 1994 or economic logic of
Rwanda and Uganda's intervention.
France on the other hand followed a different foreign pol-
icy path. To show you the importance of Africa to Paris: the
French have intervened 43 times in Francophone sub-Saha-
ran Africa "between 1960 and 2008, making France the most
militarily active external power in Africa in the nearly 50
years since decolonization" (Griffin, 2007). Suffice to it say,
the crux of the French foreign policy was probably more
anti-Rwandan than pro-Kabila. After all, the French tried to
salvage the Mobutu regime against Kabila's forces in the
First War. Paris, if anything, was consistently pro-Hutu in the
Great Lakes region and considered the Tutsi-led RPF, and its
alliance with Uganda as the real threat to Francophone hege-
mony in Africa. Fault lines with the United States started to
show up in both strategic and economic realms across Central
Africa. Washington and Paris had issues, whether it was
Congo­Brazzaville's attempt to deny the French ELF com-
pany its oil concessions and give them to American
4 SAGE Open
companies, or the increasing suspicion of Clinton's new
African leaders as a ploy to strengthen Anglophone Africa.
When Kabila turned on the Rwandan­Ugandans, it was only
natural for Paris to gravitate toward him. Instead of seeing it
as a civil war like Washington, Paris and several other
European capitals like Brussels saw the conflict as foreign
aggression.
Part II: Literature Review of Media
Effects: Indexing and Sourcing
There has been an ongoing debate about the media's power
to influence foreign policy (see Robinson, 2002). When it
comes to understandingAfrican conflicts, the media becomes
a crucial window to understanding the issues involved. To
test how the media shaped our understanding of the Congo
conflict and its relation to policy in Paris or Washington it is
important that we examine the existing literature of media
effects and its impact on reporting foreign policy.
It has been argued that the media coverage can play an
independent agenda-setting role (Shaw, 1993). This phenom-
enon of media power has been called the "CNN-effect"
(Williams, 1993). This theory has been tested in various
forms including whether the media can cause nations to
launch humanitarian interventions (see Livingston & Eachus,
1995; Robinson, 2002; Strobel, 1997). But the literature has
consistently shown that the "CNN-effect" is at best weak or
all together non-existent. Zaller and Chiu (1996) argue that
reporters will regard an event newsworthy if legitimate gov-
ernment sources say it is. Leon V. Sigal (1973) succinctly
states,
Even when the journalist is in a position to observe an event
directly, he remains reluctant to offer interpretations of his own,
preferring instead to rely on his news sources. For the reporter,
in short, most news is not what has happened, but what someone
says has happened. (as cited in Zaller & Chiu, 1996, p. 386)
Jonathan Mermin (1999) argues that the spectrum of
debate in Washington has "determined the spectrum of
debate in the news" (p. 143). Mermin argues that there are
also fiscal incentives to "base their stories on the statements
of official sources" (p. 9). For example, budgetary cutbacks
over the last decade have hit investigative journalism the
hardest. While these moves are cost effective, it has forced
the media to seek out and rely on government sources and
ultimately print the government position.
Robert Entman (2003) notes that the debate within media
studies is not about the "CNN-effect," but two competing
schools of thought. The first is what he calls the hegemonic
school, and it is best articulated by the work of Herman and
Chomsky (1988) in Manufacturing Consent. They argue
that the American media is subservient to powerful vested
economic and political interests. Corporate media will rarely
question policy, and in fact will actively filter out stories
that question the official government line. Hermann and
Chomsky contend that elite control helps manufacture con-
sent (borrowing a phrase from Walter Lippmann, 1922).
Similarly, Augelli and Murphy (1988) argue that the Anglo-
American media industry is a compliant partner in a
Gramscian model of empire building and the new world
order with the political elite.
The second school of thought is indexing and is best artic-
ulated by W. Lance Bennett (1990) in his seminal article on
government and press relations. Bennett states, "Mass media
news professionals, from the boardroom to the beat, tend to
`index' the range of voices and viewpoints in both news and
editorials according to the range of views expressed in main-
stream government debate about a given topic" (p 106).
Herring and Robinson (2003) in their exhaustive review of
the media and agenda-setting literature argue that most
scholars of media effects believe in some form of indexing
even if they do not call it so.
But for those that are afraid that indexing would lead to
Washington's ability to manufacture consent, the U.S. gov-
ernment does not speak with one voice. Warren Strobel
(1997) notes that politicians sometimes use the media to
push their preferred narrative at the expense of other offi-
cials. When journalists discover a policy or communication
vacuum within elite opinion they are free to report the
debate within Washington. The possibility for government
control is further dampened by the drive for journalistic
ethics, and the fact that it is as a profit-driven organization.
When these two variables are combined, it creates an
imperative to present viewers and readers with compelling
narratives (Bennett, 1990). Instead of relying on selling the
government policy, the media searches for stories with rich
characters and a sellable plot. Bennett (1996) states that
"increasingly sensationalistic narratives and dramatic pro-
duction values both bridge and reflect the tensions among
the various norms and practical rules that guide journalists
. . ." (p. 373).
But some recent research has suggested that the media
can still be controlled. Bennett, Lawrence, and Livingston
(2007) discuss the Washington zeitgeist that often keeps the
media in line. Journalists and government officials not only
work together, but travel in the same social circles, live in
the same neighborhoods, and attend the same schools.
These interlocking personal connections create a set of
rules or expectations about what is acceptable to cover in
the media. To challenge those rules (like the official narra-
tive) is to find yourself "out of step with 95% of your col-
leagues" (Bennett et al., 2007, p. 149). So, not only will
renegade journalists find themselves ostracized socially,
but challenging the status quo can also damage their rela-
tionships with professional sources. Media outlets that pub-
lish critical portrayals will find Washington's doors closed.
Access becomes a powerful carrot to media outlets and
withholding it a stick for the government to wield, manipu-
late, and manage the news.
Cook 5
Second, what happens to the indexing model when there
is no dissent in Washington or no breakdown in the elite
consensus (see Althaus, 2003)? Bennett et al. (2007) argue
that based on their study of the Bush Administration and its
management of the news, the press failed the American peo-
ple when it came to reporting the Iraq War and the abuses of
the Abu Ghraib prison. They argue that The Bush
Administration manipulated the Washington zeitgeist and
the weakness of the Democratic Party to the point that "real-
ity could be bent to the will of power, and power was exer-
cised by active news management" (p. 163). Though Karl
Rove and the Bush White House may not have reached the
structural depths of "manufacturing consent," Bennett et al.
paint a disturbing picture.
Part III: Contesting Frames of the
Second Congo War and Methodology
Building on the existing literature Robert Entman (1993,
2003) expands the indexing model by exploring the impor-
tance of framing issues and elite discord in what he calls cas-
cading activation. He argues this can provide a robust
understanding of when the media deviates from the govern-
ment line. Entman notes that politicians are actively trying to
frame issues. "Framing entails selecting and highlighting
some facets of events or issues, and making connections
among them so as to promote a particular interpretation,
evaluation, and/or solution" (Entman, 2003, 417). However,
the government does not have control over how issues get
framed. It is in fact a game between various political and
media actors across different levels of access points in a
decentralized political system and media structure. Scott
Althaus (2003) points out that "when journalists have reason
to believe the scope of conflict has extended to include non-
official groups or ordinary citizens, they feel less obliged to
follow the index set by U.S. officials" (p. 385). The narrative
frame can run "along a continuum from total dominance by
the government . . . to a completely evenhanded standoff
between competing frames." To win the framing game,
actors in the system need motivation, power, and strategy
(deployed by the administration and other elites), and cul-
tural congruence (the measure of cultural resonance and
magnitude of the issue) to establish the dominating frame
(Entman, 2003).
So what are the possible narratives or frames that the
media can accept for the Second Congo War? Based on
Entman's work, the first is how the Rwandans sell their par-
ticipation in the Congolese War to the world. For Kigali,
military action was necessary to end the cross-border raids
and destroy a genocidal enemy hiding in the Congo. This
frame is persuasive to an American audience. Because of
the 1994 genocide, the Tutsi-led government was seen as
the underdogs, and the Congolese war was a question of
justice for an unspeakable crime. One State Department
official even commented that Rwanda's situation was simi-
lar to that of Israel and Palestine. State Department official
Leonard Hawley argues,
I don't know that we necessarily took sides with the Rwandans
or not. But in light of the Hutu Interahamwe it was pretty clear
that had we needed to pick a side and Kagame was the right guy
to pick. Once you do that you have to take some of the issues
that Kagame has on the table and because he was getting beat up
all of the time by people who were crossing the border from the
Congo. (Cook, 2010)
However, the pro-Rwandan frame was not the only one
available to the Western press. President Laurent Kabila
presents a counter frame to the crisis based on the impor-
tance of Congolese sovereignty. He argues that Rwanda and
Uganda illegally invaded his nation. The war was one of
aggression and not self defense. Kabila claimed that Kigali
and Kampala were less concerned with border security than
"mass scale looting" and the "illegal exploitation of the min-
eral and forest resources of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo" (UN, 2002).
But we can also present an alternate hypothesis that chal-
lenges the prevalent model of indexing altogether. The
Second Congo War takes place after the collapse of com-
munism. Throughout most of the Cold War, the media
accepted at face value the idea that communism was aggres-
sive, internationally oriented, and monolithically led by
Moscow. In the 1960s, Congolese conflicts like the Katangan
secession, the rise of Mobutu, and the removal and assassi-
nation of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, as well as con-
flicts in Angola, Ethiopia, and Mozambique were indexed to
the struggle against communism. The media was a compli-
ant partner in the dissemination of the government's policies
[or frames] at home and abroad. Entman (2004) argues that
the collapse of communism weakened the "journalists'habit
of deference," and they became critical of President
Clinton's foreign policy (p. 107). The White House was no
longer able to dominate the framing debate as it once had
during the height of the Cold War. Not only were elites
divided about the priorities of the post­Cold War world but
the media were now free to produce their own counter nar-
ratives to events.
One could also hypothesize that coverage of third-world
conflicts in the post­Cold War world are no longer indexed
to Washington's strategic interests. Althaus argues that
official indexing of government positions should be the
exception not the rule in the post­Cold War paradigm. The
Congolese conflict might be a good example where
"authoritative sources are largely silent and no govern-
mental process is involved, the storytelling imperative can
predominate" (Cook, 1996, p. 478). Thus, one could postu-
late that the media might come up with its own story tell-
ing narrative. For example, instead of communism, the
media could rely on the tropes of "ancient tribal hatreds."

So, this article will also examine the use ethnicity and
terms like Hutu and Tutsi in the reporting of the war. By
looking at the Second Congo War through these variables,
we should hopefully paint a picture how these newspapers
covered the story, where they differed, and where they
might in fact be similar.
Method
To test these competing frames, we need to examine and
code coverage of the Second Congo War in the pages of the
New York Times and the Washington Post to assess whether
the American press was biased against Laurent Kabila's
framing. However, I have also included in this study the
leading French dailies--Le Monde and Le Figaro--and the
United Kingdom's The Guardian and London Times; also
included in this study are the Guardian's sister Sunday (only)
paper the Observer, and the Times sister paper, the Sunday
Times. For this study, I rolled the Observer into the data for
the Guardian and the Sunday Times into the regular Times.
I have selected these six news papers because they are in
some form or another considered official "newspapers of
record" for their respective nations. When it comes to report-
ing of American foreign policy and international events,
there is no other daily paper that can compete with the New
York Times and Washington Post. Hillel Nossek (2004)
argues that foreign news in the United States is mediated by
a few gatekeepers. These two papers have the power to drive
the national media agenda in the way they choose to frame
stories (Handley, 2008). The same gatekeeper status can be
said for the press in every nation. The two newspapers of
record in France are Le Monde and Le Figaro. However,
French media operates differently from that of the United
States. First, both papers are truly national, whereas the
Times and Post are read nationally, but they are still the local
papers for the New York and Washington metro areas.
Second, editorially, Le Monde is clearly a left of center news-
paper and Le Figaro is conservative.2 This idea of being so
open about editorial bias is anathema in the United States. As
for the British newspapers, I chose what had been the histori-
cally left wing Manchester Guardian (though it is no longer
Manchester) and the more conservative London Times. The
UK Daily Telegraph is usually considered by more a "paper
of record," but the Guardian provides us with another right/
left perspective that may be interesting to examine. These
papers are all certain to capture the elite opinion of their
respective nations.
I then selected the articles from these papers using the
Lexis­Nexis databases. I examined the conflict from January
1, 1998 (about 8 months before the outbreak of the war) until
several days after Kabila's death--January 18, 2001. The rea-
son I arbitrarily chose January 18th as the end date was a
belief that coverage toward Kabila would be qualitatively dif-
ferent after his assassination. I further narrowed the search by
using the words "Congo" and "Kabila" for all newspapers.
These key words are the same in French as well. If I was just
to look up the word "Congo," the search would capture
Congo­Brazzaville, or any other nonpolitical references.
These two words guaranteed that every story was about
Laurent Kabila and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Altogether, I found a population of 496 stories in theAmerican
papers: 269 in the Times and 227 in the Washington Post. For
the six newspapers, there were 1,615 articles all together. I
will explore these numbers more in depth in the section on
findings. These stories and articles become my units of
analysis.
When one examines the kind of articles and stories in the
surveyed population, it is important to note that 44% of the
stories in the Washington Post were news briefs (the "World
In Brief" section), which provided short and basic synopses
of daily global events. Only 37 articles in the New York Times
were in the equivalent "World Briefings." Overall, the Times
had better-quality coverage of the conflict. Three main Times
journalists (stationed in Africa as bureau chiefs) and the UN
beat writer accounted for 48% of the all stories found in the
paper (Ian Fisher, Howard French, Norimitsu Onishi, and in
New York, Barbara Crossette). The two main African report-
ers for the Post were Lynne Duke, Karl Vick, and to a lesser
extent James Rupert and Jon Jeter (7 stories apiece); together,
they accounted for 33% of all media coverage of the Congo.
These Post journalists combined with the "World in Brief"
section amounted to 77% of Washington Post coverage.
Editorials only amounted to 6% of the entire sample: 14 in
the Times and 13 in the Post. These kinds of numbers are
consistent across nations.
When it comes to the actual methodology of how to study
these articles, there are two methods. First, was the readings
of articles and manual coding article by article. Though this
process is time consuming, it guarantees that framing and
bias is placed within the proper context. However, I also uti-
lized the NVivo software program for content analysis as
well. The full text of each article was downloaded as a
Microsoft Word document into the NVivo program. This
allowed me to search for key words, and examine word
counts quickly and efficiently, often within seconds.
Furthermore, there is a higher rate of coding reliability to this
data. I utilize word counts as a measurement of how impor-
tant key words are to each paper across time. The raw data
yielded in such a search has some utility in measuring cover-
age of foreign affairs. The more important the word or con-
cept, person, or place, the more the word gets used. Thus, a
word like "Washington" is used far more in the New York
Times than in Le Monde, a natural reflection of the priorities
of the American newspaper.
However, there are problems with this methodological
approach. First, raw word counts do not necessarily give us
an "apples to apples" examination across newspapers. So the
NVivo program also allows the user to measure the "percent-
age of coverage," meaning the volume of data in each source
categorized by that particular word search. For example, take
Cook 7
the nation Angola, a crucial ally of Laurent Kabila. The New
York Times actually led all newspapers with 278 references,
and London Times had 82. But with closer examination, we
discover that the New York Times used the word Angola
0.20%, while the London Times used it 0.27%. So even
though the NewYork paper was clearly the leader onAngolan
coverage--when the London Times did write about the
Congo War, its coverage was focused more on Angola's role
in the conflict than the Times. Though such a methodological
approach is not perfect, it does allow a better "apples to
apples" look at the kind of coverage these papers gave to this
event.
Part IV: Findings
When it came to American, British, and French coverage of
the Second Congo War from January 1998 through January
2001, one fact stands out: the French daily Le Monde led the
coverage with 641 articles. This is twice the coverage of the
New York Times, which came in second with 269, and the
Washington Post third with 227, fourth was the Guardian
with 191, Le Figaro was next with 181, and finally, the
British London Times with 106 stories over the 37-month
period examined (see Figure 1 below). It is clear that the
readers of Le Monde were well versed in the conflict, but
American newspapers held their own in total coverage. Fears
that the American press ignores African conflicts are
unfounded--at least when it came to the Congo.
If we disaggregate the data further, we find the newspa-
pers for the most part followed the same reporting trends (see
Figure 2). In the first 7 months of 1998, the total stories for
all six papers were 224, or an average of 32.1 a month.
However, during the August 1998 invasion 264 appeared in
just that month alone, and 125 the following month. From
August to December, the monthly average was 110, but
coverage soon slipped across the board. In 1999, the average
monthly stories dropped to 36.2, and fell even further in
2000 to 23.9 a month. This was true of all newspapers cov-
ered: so, for example, in 2000, the average monthly total for
Le Monde was 9 and the New York Times was 5. All papers
had the same rough valleys and peaks of coverage in the time
period examined. The initial August invasion caused an
immediate media stir in the Western world, but it soon
dissipated.
Coverage of Rwanda and Uganda
If there should be one key difference between American and
French newspaper coverage, it would be on the role Rwanda
and Uganda played in the war. As mentioned, diplomatically,
the United States was sympathetic to outright supportive of
the Rwandan and Ugandan invasions. However, can we find
evidence of this inAmericans newspapers? Did theAmerican
press index their coverage to policies set in Washington?
Would French newspapers, index their stories to Paris?
To answer this question, I discovered that the manual cod-
ing of these articles and stories proved difficult. My initial
round of coding found that out of the American population
sampled (n = 496): 2% of the reporting would be considered
pro-Kabila, 8% anti-Kabila, 2% might be characterized as
pro-Rwanda, 0.007% was specifically anti-Ugandan, and the
overwhelming majority (87%) would best be seen as a ver-
sion of journalistic neutrality. Simply put, the American
press did not use a "Rwandan frame." If anything, the press
emphasized a storytelling narrative of how the Congo War
unfolded. In the second round of coding, I used the NVivo
program to analyze the differences between the press in dif-
ferent nations.
When it came to overall coverage of Rwanda, the
American newspapers devoted more space. The Post had
0.61% of its coverage dedicated and the New York Times had
0.60%, The Times (U.K.), 0.49%, the Guardian 0.43%, and

the Le Monde had 0.46%, and Figaro was 0.32%. Those
American numbers show that Rwanda was mentioned con-
sistently more than in any other national coverage of the
Congo War. However, those numbers do not hold up when
we look at the data more deeply (see Table 1). For example,
we find that mentions of Paul Kagame, the future President
of Rwanda, and the real force behind the invasion was men-
tioned 62 times in the Washington Post, and considering how
many articles the French newspaper had about the war only
60 times in Le Monde. In fact, the Post led all newspapers
with coverage of Kagame with 0.05%, but the French daily
Le Figaro was second with 0.03%. If you prefer mentions of
the Rwandan capital city of Kigali (and thus capture more of
the diplomatic side of the story) to be a better proxy, then we
find Le Monde leads coverage with 0.14%, Le Figaro sec-
ond, and the Post third. Clearly, when Le Monde did cover
Rwanda, their reporting was substantively more in depth
than the New York Times.
When it comes to overall coverage of Uganda (see Table 2
below), once again anAmerican newspaper led coverage: The
New York Times had 0.40%, with the London Times at 0.39%,
the Guardian and the Post at 0.31% and 0.30%, respectively.
Once again, French news coverage were slightly lower with
the Le Figaro with 0.19% and Le Monde with 0.21%. But
something interesting happens when we disaggregate the data
further: we find that mention of Ugandan President Museveni
is almost identical in five newspapers at 0.06/0.07%, but Le
Monde is slightly higher at 0.09%. Also mention of Kampala,
the capital city is highest in the London Times and Le Monde,
but not significant in the other papers. The U.S. papers may
have had more coverage of Uganda overall but once again Le
Monde, had more specific coverage.
Considering the bias of American official policy it is dif-
ficult to say, based on these numbers, that the press was sub-
stantially different across nations. However, if you wanted to
compare American newspapers with those of the French, you
will see that the New York Times and the Washington Post has
a slight bias toward reporting on Rwanda and Uganda than
Le Monde. However, in both cases it is clear that Le Monde
may have had deeper coverage of the diplomacy if we use the
capital cities as proxies.
Genocides, Massacres, and the Ethnicity
But if we really wanted to spot a Rwandan frame inAmerican
reporting, one should find it in the coverage of the gross
human rights abuses that occurred during the Congolese
wars. As noted, many of these massacres were blamed on
Laurent Kabila. However, as a 2010 Christian Science
Monitor headline announced, "Bombshell UN report leaked:
`Crimes of genocide' against Hutus in Congo" was actually
conducted by the Rwandan Army (Stearns). The Rwandan
Army coordinated the killings but Kabila got the blame. The
UN Mapping Report stated that over 600 separate acts of
violence, some reaching genocidal proportions were com-
mitted over a 10-year time span. Some of this happened dur-
ing the First Congo War, but massacres and violence
continued into the Second, which is our time frame exam-
ined. If U.S. policy was "pro-Rwandan," we should see sig-
nificant differences in how the American and French
newspapers treated the issue. Indexing would hold that
American coverage of Rwanda would be positive compared
with that of the French newspapers, and critical of Kabila.
During the time Laurent Kabila was stonewalling the UN
examination of his human rights record, about 6% of the New
York Times and Washington Post coverage reflected that.
French reporting of the "investigation" was minor (holding
that other words could be used). There was no wider substan-
tive Western narrative of a "counter genocide committed by
the Rwandans in any of the papers examined." If we specifi-
cally look at the word "genocide," it is mentioned only in the
context of the 1994 genocide inside Rwanda and never to the
current events (see Table 3 below). This linkage of the
Rwandan genocide with the Congolese coverage was consis-
tent across newspapers and nations. So for example, The
Guardian led coverage with 0.16% mentions, the London
Times has 0.11%, and the Washington Post had 0.10%, the
New York Times and Le Figaro are tied with 0.06%. Le
Monde used two spellings: genocide (0.04%) and génocide
(0.07%), both of which are included here. Overall, about 1/4
(24%) of the entire American media coverage of the Congo
was actually related to the 1994 genocide.
However, I also searched for the word "massacres" as a
proxy for genocide (which is a politically loaded term) to

possibly describe the killings. Here, we find Le Monde with
the most with 219 mentions and 0.09% coverage; Figaro
with 0.05%, and The Post and Times were tied with 0.04%.
There really is no significant difference. I also explored the
phrase, "human rights abuses" (in French as well), and this
yields some interesting results in a trans-national study.
American newspapers use the term more consistently, the
Post has 0.28%, and the Times 0.25%, and that is definitively
more than Le Monde, which is only at 0.15%, and Figaro
with 0.06%. Of course, it is possible that the phrase is more
common in the United States than in France. The British
newspapers did not significantly use the term.
When it came to human rights atrocities, it would seem
that the overall tone and content of reporting was similar
across newspapers. Rwanda's role in committing a counter
genocide was obscured, watered down, or lost among the
narrative of a war. However, this narrative of brutality
becomes problematic in trying to understand reporting on
foreign conflicts. The Congo War was a brutal, complicated
and messy war. Under these circumstances it was difficult for
the press to assess blame for the violence as it was happening
in the "moment" with incomplete information. Thus, based
on the evidence, I would suggest that American elite cover-
age of the Congo conflict, in regard to the Rwandan counter
genocide was not implicitly tied to indexing of government
policy toward Kabila.
What might explain this? A possible framing hypothesis
could be the fact that a Western audience a priori expects
African conflicts to be brutal. This creates the media slant
toward giving people what they want: the reporting of mob
violence, rape camps, and slaughtering of villagers­which
are factual enough, neutral even. But what is missing in
much of the Western media is the cohesive contextual frame-
work on why the mass violence was occurring in the first
place and how that context was needed to end it.
The only context provided was that of the Rwandan geno-
cide, this is not necessarily biased, wrong, or misleading.
The Interahamwe weighed heavily into Rwandan strategic
calculations. The conflict between Hutus and Tutsi was a
driving force in the shifting loyalties of the Congolese actors
involved. In the Second Congo War, the Hutu were Kabila's
allies, but in the First War, they were his enemies. But the
focus on Rwanda and African ethnicity has its own set of
problems. Steven Livingstone and Todd Eachus (1999) point
out in their work on the Rwanda genocide that the media
accepted and advanced the framework of "ancient tribal
hatreds" while the atrocities of the Serbs in Bosnia were
compared with 20th century Nazi Germany. Gary Streiker of
CNN noted, "this story is probably the worst tribal hostility
in all of Africa . . . hostility that goes back centuries long
before European colonization" (Power, 2002, p. 253).
How did the Western press understand ethnicity in the
Congo? The answer revolved around Rwanda. The
Washington Post led newspapers with the use of the word
(ethnic) at 0.22%, and Le Figaro the least at 0.04%. The New
York Times was 0.11% and grouped near The Times and Le
Monde (0.07%). So it is interesting to note that the Post used
the word twice as much as the New York Times. But I also
disaggregated the data further and looked at the words Hutu
and Tutsi. Not only are there Hutus and Tutsi in Rwanda, but
in neighboring Burundi and inside the Congo. In fact, the
Congolese Tutsi (Banyamulenge) were part of a long-term
Congolese discussion of whether they were "Congolese" or
Rwandans, and violence toward them predates, sometimes
trumps, and sometimes works in conjunction with the 1994
genocide.
When "Hutu" and "Tutsi" were examined (see Table 4),
we found that The New York Times led coverage of the word
Hutu 0.22%, and the Guardian had the least with 0.08%. The
London Times led with Tutsi with 0.31%. In fact, the London
Times (in conjunction with the word genocide) spent consid-
erable coverage discussing the 1994 Rwandan genocide as
the context to the war. But the Guardian had the least men-
tions of Tutsi with 0.13%. The British newspapers had the
fewest mentions of Hutu and Tutsi overall--but significant
differences between the two with how they reported the
Tutsi. The data also revealed something else: In every
instance, Tutsi was used more than Hutu with one caveat, Le
Monde and Le Figaro had the words almost at parity (+.01
difference) and the New York Times (+.03 difference), the
Post used Tutsi +0.08% more, The Guardian was +0.05%,
and the outlier was the Times of London, which had a +0.18%
significant difference. Part of Tutsi dominance might have to
do with the Banyamulenge (The Tutsi of the Congolese

Kivu), which on their own never accounted for more than
0.01% of coverage. If we look at the actual word count, we
find Le Monde leading with 33 mentions of this group over
the 37-month period; the Guardian second with 21; the
Washington Post 17 and New York Times 14, and Le Figaro
7. But when dealing with numbers so small, there were no
real differences in the reporting.
But the focus on the 1994 genocide also blinds or obscures
coverage of modern events NPR had an interesting exchange
with scholar Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja about the modern
elements of genocide. Nzongola-Ntalaja argued that
ethnic groups do have prejudices . . . But it's not enough to make
a person pick up a knife or gun and kill somebody else. That
occurs when politicians come and excite passion and try to
threaten people-make people believe that they are being
threatened by other groups that are going to be extinguished.
NPR's Daniel Zwerdling responded, "Of course, in most
of these battlegrounds . . . there is ancient ethnic hatred and
something that surprises me actually is that your blaming
modern, contemporary African politicians for this divide and
conquer, playing one tribe against another." Zwerdling
seemed surprised that Nzongola-Ntalaja could put this event
into such an understandable and modern light (All Things
Considered, 1994). But Nzongola-Ntalaja logic of modern
politics brings up an interesting question: What did Rwanda
do once it got inside the Congo?
The War of Diamonds and Raw Materials
If the focus of the war was Rwanda and Uganda's external
security Laurent Kabila argued that it was really a question of
Congolese internal sovereignty and control over its natural
resources. The Congo is rich in gold, diamonds, coltan, cas-
siterite, copper, cobalt, wolfram, zinc, oil, as well as timber,
coffee, and palm oil (Amnesty International, 2003). The
fighting eventually revolved around the control of these
resources and not the rebel factions. The UN Panel of Experts
(UN, 2002) was clear: Rwanda and Uganda (and everyone
else for that matter) was vigorously participating in a cam-
paign of enrichment. Eventually, Rwanda and Uganda turned
on each other to fight over diamonds. The UN added that
there were concerns "about gross human rights abuses that
are linked with the extraction of these commodities." In the
end, the war in the Congo was more about money than border
security. In fact, the idea that someAfrican leaders are corrupt
and use the apparatus of the state to enrich themselves is nei-
ther shocking nor new. The reality of the Second Congo War
is how the process of globalization has changed the game of
exploitation. Sovereign leaders, foreign nations, and rebels
could enrich themselves in this new world, not by seizing the
capital city (which will still occur) but the diamond fields.
But if economic motivations were central to the conflict
why was it only a major theme in 2% of the articles in the
New York Times and Washington Post. Overall, the economic
dimensions of the war were featured in 53 articles (or 12%),
still insignificant to the larger backdrop of coverage.
Remember the Rwandan genocide was mentioned in 24% of
the stories. I then examined the American Press for who was
responsible for the exploitation. When we break down those
53 articles we noticed an interesting trend: the corruption of
Kabila and his allies Angola, and Zimbabwe accounted for
51%. About 13% were neutral or vague about the actors
involved in the exploitation (everyone was blamed). The cor-
ruption of the rebel groups fighting Kabila (and backed by
Rwanda and Uganda) made up 8% of the population.
Kampala and Kigali made up 28%; most of it occurring when
they turned on each other over diamonds in June 2000. When
you place the coverage of Rwanda and Uganda in the wider
context of all 496 stories or articles surveyed it is only 3% of
the entire population.
As in the case of human rights violations there should be
a difference of reporting between the American and French
newspapers. If the American papers were biased would they
cover the stories of looted diamonds? If we take the word
"diamond," the New York Times led coverage with 0.10%,
and the London Times came in second with 0.09% (see Table
5 below). The two French newspapers were tied with 0.04%.
Strangely enough, the Washington Post did not spend any
significant time with the word. During the period examined,
there were only 18 total references in the Post, the New York
Times had 134.
But what if we expand the list beyond diamonds? I then
searched for a basket of items, "gold, diamonds, coltan, cas-
siterite, copper, cobalt, wolfram, zinc, oil, timber, coffee and
palm oil" (including French translations). Once again the
newspapers were quite similar across nations (see Figure 3
below). In the 1st year of the war, Le Monde led coverage
with 0.09% and 67 distinct references to these words. The
New York Times, had 73 coming out to 0.07% of its coverage,
Le Figaro and Washington Post were 0.02%. Over 3 years, Le
Monde led with 338 references to the New York Times' 318,
which is really not much of a difference. When we examined
the rest of the list: The Washington Post had 131, the Guardian
was 116, the London Times 88, and Le Figaro with 35. (There
is a significant difference between Le Monde and Le Figaro.)

Honestly, considering the leftist slant of Le Monde and the
Guardian, I was surprised that there was not more coverage
of economic exploitation. Economic incentive to war was
covered minimally in all papers. However, there was no sig-
nificant difference between nations when it came to report-
ing. But if the lack of economic exploitation coverage was
not intentional, then what best explains the findings? W.
Lance Bennett et al. (2007) provide a possible answer.
Nation-state and Sub-state economic exploitation is not in
the zeitgeist or the underlying normative assumptions of
what is a compelling story, not just in the United States but
Western Europe as well. Instead, the overriding "conflict
narrative" of two sides fighting for political power is.
Part V: Theoretical Implications and
Conclusions
Throughout this paper, we have used the Second Congo War
as a case study to examine whether the elite press indexes its
coverage of foreign events to government policy. The Congo
War is a good test case for several reasons. First, it was one
of the largest conflicts in the world during the late 1990s. But
to the American public, it was an unknown war in a distant
part of the world with no national interests at stake. But
Washington did have a clear agenda for the Congo, and
throughout the conflict they passively supported Rwanda
and Uganda and its claims of border security. One could
argue that to support a new ally in the region (Clinton's New
African Leaders Initiative) the Administration may have
turned a blind eye to gross human rights abuses and eco-
nomic exploitation committed by its favored states. Clearly,
with a set American policy and no public interest, this would
be an excellent example of media indexing.
However, I argue that the two major American newspa-
pers did not index their coverage. Furthermore, and this is
important, I argue that other leading dailies in Britain and
France did not index their coverage to their own governmen-
tal policies as well. Coverage of the Second Congo War in
the Western world was remarkably more similar than it was
different. But we should add a word of caution about our
findings--correlation is not causation. There are limits to
this kind of media analysis.
This paper also raises other questions that are still worth
examining and some hark back to Bennett's zeitgeist. For
one, what is neutrality in reporting a war? For example, if
an article truthfully notes the attempts of Laurent Kabila to
stifle democracy and his rampant corruption--is this neu-
tral or biased? Should the newspaper be obliged to provide
more context about Congolese history, the troubles of creat-
ing a viable nation state in the wreck of what had been the
personal fiefdom of President Mobutu? Second, when the
papers featured longer detailed articles, Kabila's framing of
the war as an invasion and a loss Congolese sovereignty
was usually balanced with Rwanda's frame of the genocidal
Interahamwe and its need for national security. Should it
have been balanced in the first place? To some, the very
idea that Rwanda, Uganda, and their rebel movement were
given equal and nonjudgmental coverage to compete with
Kabila's claims of a foreign invasion might seem like bias
enough.
If there was a bias, it was clear to Western audiences that
the Second Congo War was fought in the shadow of the 1994
Rwandan genocide (especially The London Times). By fram-
ing, the Congo around the genocide does two things: First, it
makes the Western audience automatically sympathetic to
Rwanda's claims of border security. The idea that the Congo
was hiding, known perpetuators of genocide shuts down the
conversation about Rwanda looting the Congolese country-
side. To go back to an Israeli analogy--the capture of Adolf
Eichmann in Argentina was not a discussion of international
law on kidnapping foreign nationals--it is a story of the cap-
ture of the man who helped plan the Holocaust receive jus-
tice. Second, and indirectly, it reinforces the narrative of
ancient tribal hatred and makes the Second Congo War about
ethnicity. It would reinforce the work of Steven Livingstone
and Todd Eachus (1999). The genocide frame stops critical
thinking about the causes of the war because for average
Americans, the violence is ancient; there is nothing that can
be done. However, it does not provide the readership with
important context. Tribal hatred is fanned on by modern
problems not ancient ones.
Second is the Western bias of reporting conflicts and war.
The overwhelming reporting from all six newspapers was
the narrative of battles, massacres, and diplomacy.Traditional
reporting of conflict resembles a version of capture the flag.
The focus is always on the elites. This "Washington
Consensus" is the zeitgeist that holds political and media
elite together. Althaus, Edy, Entman, and Phalen (1996)
argue, "When there is no policy debate in Washington,
reporters offer critical analysis inside the terms of the
Washington consensus." Western interlopers of a conflict,
including the media coverage confer legitimacy to actors
who control land and access to natural resources. Simply,

reporters and editors prioritize power at the expense of a
broader discussion of democracy and in this case Congolese
civil society.
Finally is the zeitgeist of economic exploitation. While the
looting of Congolese resources were reported in the Western
press, it was not a major theme of reporting. Yet, the looting is
what probably prolonged the conflict. The opening up of the
African economy to the free markets has in some places priva-
tized profits but socialized the violence. When the Cold War
ended the aid stopped. The African leaders who traditionally
used external security aid in complex internal patronage sys-
tems were now forced to scramble and innovate. Trade not
only flourished in resource extraction, but in illicit drugs,
money laundering, and diamonds. Wars had little to do with
political ideologies, but the control over the nation's natural
resources.
In the end, I argue that the media must broaden its concep-
tual framework of how it reports African conflicts. We have
noted that the war was not necessarily indexed to policy.
Sometimes the press might rely on older more familiar tropes,
so in the Congo we see the obsession with genocide. However,
the media is still ill equipped to explain these new kinds of
conflicts because they do not have the proper vocabulary in
their rhetorical toolkits. Paraphrasing the words of Bennett,
sub-state economic exploitation is not in the underlying nor-
mative assumptions of what is a compelling story. Instead, the
overriding conflict narrative of two sides fighting for political
power is. While that may be neutral, in a sense, the selection of
reporting the actions of elite actors at the expense of civil soci-
ety is the bias, and this is what connects all Western papers.

Notes
1. There are several theories about who was behind the assas-
sination. Many felt that the Rwandans and Ugandans were
behind it. Others suggest that Kabila may have been shot with
Angolan (one of his allies) complicity.
2. Though a word of caution for American readers, conserva-
tism in France is more liberal than the United States on many
issues.
