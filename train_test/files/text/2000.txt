ABSTRACT
GORTMAKER, S. L., R. LEE, A. L. CRADOCK, A. M. SOBOL, D. T. DUNCAN, and Y. C. WANG. Disparities in Youth Physical
Activity in the United States: 2003­2006. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 44, No. 5, pp. 888­893, 2012. Purpose: This study aimed
to examine changes in physical activity among children and adolescents, by race/ethnicity, in the United States from 2003­2004 to
2005­2006. Methods: Secondary analysis of the objectively measured accelerometer data among children and adolescents 6­19 yr:
2003­2004 (n = 1665) and 2005­2006 (n = 1716) from the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey 2003­2004 and 2005­2006. We estimated regression coefficients for change between the two periods by age group, accounting
for sampling design and adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and number of hours monitored. We tested for differences in mean
accelerometer counts per minute and minutes per day of moderate and vigorous physical activity trends by race/ethnicity and gender.
Results: Physical activity decreased with age, boys were more active than girls, and non-Hispanic black children were more active
than non-Hispanic whites (all P G 0.01). Overall mean accelerometer counts increased from 2003­2004 to 2005­2006 for children ages
6­11 yr (+31.6 counts per minute; 95% confidence interval = 0.51­62.6) but not among adolescents ages 12­19 yr. There was
an increase over time in mean accelerometer counts among 6- to 11-yr-old non-Hispanic white children (+52.4 counts per minute,
P = 0.007; 95% confidence interval = 15.7­89) but a decrease among non-Hispanic black and Mexican American children. No changes
over the period in moderate and vigorous physical activity were found in either age group. Conclusions: The lack of improvement in
physical activity among all children and adolescents and a potentially emerging race­ethnic disparity indicate a need for further
research on potential mechanisms underlying these differences. Effective interventions to improve physical activity opportunities and
attenuate the decline in activity levels as children enter adolescence are needed. Key Words: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS,

The prevalence of obesity among boys and girls
in the United States has increased at rapid rates with
the highest prevalence among non-Hispanic black
and Hispanic children and adolescents (22,23,30). This grow-
ing epidemic necessitates the identification and monitoring
of modifiable behavioral contributors to energy imbalance.
The pivotal role of physical activity in weight management
among adults is well established (19). Among children and
adolescents, in addition to healthier weight gain during growth,
the health benefits of achieving recommended physical activ-
ity levels include a favorable body composition and improved
cardiovascular health and muscular fitness. National guide-
lines recommend that children and adolescents accumulate
Q60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)
every day (36).
Research has consistently documented gender and age
disparities in youth physical activity such that boys are more
active than girls and children become less active as they grow
older (15,20,27,39). There is also some evidence for racial/
ethnic disparities in physical activity, but results have been
mixed depending on self-report versus accelerometer esti-
mates (39). The available data on trends over time indicate an
overall decline in physical activities, including active trans-
port to school (16), self-reported vigorous physical activity
(1), and participation in high school physical education (3).
Much of the physical activity data have been traditionally
assessed via questionnaires despite limited reliability and
validity of self-reported activities, particularly for children
(5). Recently, national accelerometer data measuring physi-
cal activity levels among US children and adolescents have
become available (32). Accelerometers, small devices that

measure minute-to-minute physical movement, are the best
available objective and precise measures of free-living activ-
ity. Evidence indicates good reliability (18,35) of these de-
vices among children and adolescents, with good evidence
for validity against criterion physical activity measures (e.g.,
direct observation, oxygen consumption [V
 O2
], HR, and
doubly labeled water) (7,9,24,35).
This study examines changes in physical activity among
children and adolescents ages 6­19 yr in the United States from
2003­2004 to 2005­2006, using population-based accelerom-
eter data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), and assesses evidence for differences in
these changes by age, gender, and race/ethnicity.
METHODS
Participants. The NHANES is an ongoing series of
nationwide surveys and clinical examinations conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The sur-
veys use a multistage, clustered, probability sampling strat-
egy to select households and individuals to provide national
estimates representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized
US population. Non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans,
and adolescents ages 12­19 yr are among the oversampled
populations. Beginning in 1999, NHANES collected data
yearly. This analysis includes two waves, four years of data
(2003­2004 and 2005­2006) on physical activity level, col-
lected using accelerometers among children and adolescents
ages 6­19. More complete description of data collection pro-
cedures and analytic guidelines are on the NCHS Web site
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). Informed consent was
obtained by the NCHS as part of the NHANES data collec-
tion, and the institutional review board at the Harvard School
of Public Health determined that, because we were using
publicly available data, this work was exempt.
Following the published research of Troiano et al. (32),
we included data from children and adolescents ages 6­19
with accelerometer data from these two nationally represen-
tative samples. Our change analyses are presented for non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American
children and adolescents only because of the small sample
sizes for other racial/ethnic groups. We defined two age cat-
egories: children (ages 6­11) and adolescents (ages 12­19)
to make our results comparable to previous research from
the same data set and reflect distinct developmental stages.
Age, gender, and race/ethnicity were self-reported in home
interviews before accelerometer administration. Interviews
for participants G16 yr were conducted by a proxy.
Physical activity assessment. Measures of physical
activity including mean accelerometer counts per minute
and minutes per day of MVPA were collected directly after
a health examination with the ActiGraph model 7164 accel-
erometer (ActiGraph, LLC, Ft. Walton Beach, FL) (4). This
small uniaxial device measures physical activity intensity by
quantifying and recording ``counts'' of vertical acceleration
(38) and was requested to be worn for 7 d (35). The ActiGraph
7164 accelerometer has demonstrated high reliability (18).
In addition, the ActiGraph has been validated against crite-
rion measures (e.g., direct observation, oxygen consumption
[V
 O2
], HR, and doubly labeled water) and correlated with total
(r = 0.39) and activity (r = 0.54) energy expenditure as mea-
sured by the doubly labeled water (7).
In NHANES, the instrument was programmed to record
data continuously at 1-min intervals (or epochs). Participants
ages 6 and older were asked to wear an accelerometer on
an elasticized belt positioned over their right hip during all
waking hours, only removing it for swimming or bathing.
Assistants responsible for the medical examination adminis-
tration fitted the accelerometers to participants and pro-
vided initial instructions; further assistance with the activity
monitoring protocol was available over a toll-free number.
Participants mailed their accelerometers back to NHANES
headquarters in a prepaid envelope after the end of 7-d mon-
itoring period (4).
Accelerometer data processing. All analysis of ac-
celerometer data followed algorithms developed by Troiano
et al. (32), available at the National Cancer Institute Web
site (http://www.riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam). Fol-
lowing these guidelines, we excluded data from participants
whose accelerometers were not calibrated on return. Im-
plausible values, such as long sequences of very high counts,
were set to missing. Wear and nonwear times were defined
to determine valid days. Nonwear time was defined as a
period of at least 60 min of zero intensity counts, allowing for
1- to 2-min spans with counts fewer than 101. Wear time
was calculated by subtracting nonwear time from 24 h. A
valid day was defined as any day with Q10 h of wear time
(32). Our analyses only included youth with four or more
valid days of data consistent with prior recommendations in
the literature (33).
Mean counts per minute were calculated by dividing the
total counts of activity by the minutes of wear time for all
valid days. We applied published age-specific count thresh-
olds obtain from calibration studies by the Freedson group
to calculate minutes of MVPA (34) as cited in Troiano et al.
(32). We defined MVPA as Q4 METs in 6- to 17-yr-old
participants and 3 METs in 18- and 19-yr-old participants.
We used 1-min bouts to calculate total minutes per day
of MVPA.
Statistical analysis. Analyses were conducted with SAS
(Version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). We used the pro-
cedures SURVEYMEANS and SURVEYREG to account for
samples weights and the clustered study design in estimating
means and regressions documenting changes in physical ac-
tivity between the two periods. Sample weights available on
the NHANES Web site (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm)
reflect the unequal probabilities of selection, nonresponse
adjustments, and adjustments to independent population con-
trol totals.
We stratified by two age groups (ages 6­11 and 12­19 yr)
following past research (32) and controlled for age, gender,
race/ethnicity, and number of hours monitored on average in

multivariate regression models. We used indicator variables
to indicate the later period (2005­2006 =1 vs 2003­2004 = 0)
and racial/ethnic group (non-Hispanic white as the refer-
ence category; with indicators for black non-Hispanic and
Mexican American). We also tested for significance of inter-
action terms of gender (male = 1 vs female = 0) by period
as well as race/ethnicity by period. All tests are two-tailed.
RESULTS
We included 1665 children and adolescents (ages 6­19 yr)
from NHANES 2003­2004 and 1716 from NHANES
2005­2006. Approximately 75% of the subjects had 94 d
of valid accelerometer data. Table 1 summarizes the char-
acteristics of the two NHANES samples and the population
distributions after applying sampling weights. These esti-
mates show comparable race/ethnicity, gender, and age dis-
tributions in 2003­2004 and 2005­2006.
Table 2 displays unadjusted mean accelerometer counts per
minute and MVPA counts by age, gender, and race/ethnicity
at both periods. Younger children were more physically ac-
tive than adolescents, and boys were more active than girls
(P G 0.01 at both periods).
In the first set of regression models, we adjusted for age,
gender, race/ethnicity, and number of hours of monitored time
to account for potential differences in the sample composition
between the years (Table 3; ``partially adjusted models,''
models 1 and 2). There was a strong age-dependent decrease
in mean counts and MVPA, and the physical activity level
was also significantly higher among males (both P G 0.0001).
There was an increase in mean accelerometer counts among
children ages 6­11 from 2003­2004 to 2005­2006 (31.6;
P = 0.047; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.5­62.6) but
no significant changes for minutes of moderate and vigor-
ous activity from 2003­2004 to 2005­2006. There were no
changes over time in physical activity outcomes among ado-
lescents ages 12­19.
A second set of regression models (Table 3, models 3
and 4) examined changes between NHANES 2003­2004
and 2005­2006 by race/ethnicity. The results indicated an
increase in mean accelerometer counts among 6- to 11-yr-old
non-Hispanic white children (+52.4 minj1, P = 0.007; 95%
CI = 15.7­89) and an increase in minutes of MVPA for
this group (+7.9 minIdj1, P = 0.01; 95% CI = 1.9­13.9).
Conversely, we found a significant interaction for mean
accelerometer counts among non-Hispanic black (j64.3;
P = 0.05; 95% CI = j125.3 to j3.3) and Mexican American
children (j64.1; P = 01; 95% CI = j109.8 to j18.4), in-
dicating no increase in physical activity level among these
groups over time (i.e., the negative interaction of j64.3 is
added to the coefficient for year of 52.4 to indicate overall
no difference). A significant interaction was also found for
MVPA among Mexican American children (j9.6; P = 0.02;
95% CI = j17.3 to j1.9), also indicating no overall evi-
dence for change among this group over time. Among 12- to
19-yr-olds, there was no evidence of interaction by race/
ethnicity. There were no statistically significant interactions
of time with gender for either age group.
DISCUSSION
These nationally representative accelerometer data are the
first such objective indicators of population-specific changes
in physical activity level in children and adolescents. Among
children ages 6­11 yr, there was a small overall increase

in mean accelerometer counts, although we observed these
increases only among non-Hispanic white youth and not
among Mexican American or non-Hispanic black youth.
Because data are currently only available for two periods, the
observed changes should be interpreted with caution. Among
children, we observed racial­ethnic differences in change in
mean accelerometer counts between the two time points as
indicated by the significant negative interactions for His-
panic and non-Hispanic black children with period. We did
not find significant changes between the time points in mean
accelerometer counts or minutes of MVPA among children
and adolescents ages 12­19 yr.
It is also important to note the persistent and substantial
age and gender differences in physical activity measures with
adolescents being markedly less active than children and girls
being less active than boys. These results are consistent with
a large body of previous research (15,20,27,39) and point to
the need for continued monitoring and the implementation of
effective interventions that improve physical activity oppor-
tunities for girls and attenuate declines in physical activity
levels as children enter adolescence.
Although the present analyses are the first to document
changes over time in population-specific estimates of phys-
ical activity using nationally representative accelerometer
data, our results are consistent with earlier evidence for racial/
ethnic disparities in self-reported physical activity, including
declines over time in physical education class participation
(3) and in vigorous physical activity (1) among non-Hispanic
blacks. Although an analysis of the NHANES 2003­2004
accelerometer data indicates that young black children were
meeting physical activity recommendations at slightly higher
rates than white children (39), it is the lack of improvement
over time detected for non-Hispanic black and Mexican
American children in the present study--a possible emerging
disparity in physical activity--that is a cause for concern.
These results can be interpreted in the context of the
energy gap that contributes to growing overweight and obe-
sity (37). Using Harrell's estimate of 1.71 kcalIkgj1Ihj1
as the average resting metabolism for children and the aver-
age body weight of 30 kg for a typical 9-yr-old boy from
the sample, we estimate that the increase in physical activ-
ity documented for non-Hispanic white children ages 6­11
represents an increase of about 20.2 kcalIdj1. This level of
change, if not accompanied by increased energy intake,
could help to offset the average energy gap that has been
contributing to growing childhood obesity in the United States
(37). The lack of change seen among non-Hispanic black
and Hispanic children could, in fact, contribute to growing
disparities in childhood obesity.
This study uses objective measures of physical activity
obtained using highly reliable accelerometers to produce
physical activity estimates that have been validated against
multiple end points. In addition, the large, nationally repre-
sentative sample of children and adolescents with over-
sampling of blacks and Mexican Americans improves the
precision of physical activity estimates for these population
groups.
Limitations of the study include the use of two cross-
sectional samples that do not follow the same children
across time and thus have less accurate estimates of change.
Nonresponse, either by refusing to partake in the study or
forgetting to wear the accelerometer each day, may lead to
some bias. These uniaxial accelerometers are not worn dur-
ing swimming and do not accurately record upper body

physical activity (e.g., weight lifting). In addition, the 1-min
epoch used to collect accelerometer data may underestimate
activity levels for very young children because their activi-
ties often occur in relatively short bursts rather than in long
bouts (2). The analysis also does not capture whether children
had any activity-limiting ailments or disabilities. Although we
recognize the effect of income and other measures of socio-
economic status on physical activity, we chose to focus on
race/ethnicity because family income frequently shifts across
time and has a complex relationship with race/ethnicity along
the pathway to disease and health behavior. Seasonality may
have effects on the physical activity pattern among children
and adolescents. We explored this effect on our results by
including a variable indicating whether a child is on school
vacation between grades (generally indicating summer vaca-
tion). However, our estimates did not change nor did it in-
crease the goodness of fit statistic (R2; data not shown).
Lastly, these data represent national physical activity patterns
from 2003 to 2006. Future studies will benefit from a longer
data series to document population-specific trends in phys-
ical activity patterns using accelerometer data from future
NHANES studies.
Although this study does not examine how potential dif-
ferences in physical activity among racial/ethnic populations
may be emerging, differential access to resources, recent
changes in the US school climate and an increase in obesity
prevention efforts including more physical activity in more
privileged communities may help to explain these potential
disparities (6,10,11,26,29). Racial/ethnic minority children
have reduced access to physical activity resources (e.g., rec-
reational facilities, parks, playgrounds) and reduced access
to safe playgrounds (6,8,11). Moreover, neighborhood factors
through the built environmental (such as safety and walk-
ability) may be particularly large influences due to the per-
sistence of racial segregation in the United States (17,25,40).
The initiation of No Child Left Behind in 2001 has
steadily shifted the focus of public schools to standardized
test achievement, and this focus has often led to declines in
funding for physical education, recess, and other school-day
determinants of physical activity levels (29). Recent studies
have found racial differences in school sports participation,
required physical education, and girls' physical activity levels
in school (14,26). Because low-income and racial/ethnic mi-
nority children get a larger percentage of their daily physical
activity within school settings, they are likely differentially
affected by recent changes in school climate (13). Finally,
because knowledge of the obesity epidemic has grown and
become a national priority during the past decade, it is pos-
sible that white children have been the early benefactors
of physical activity interventions and programs within the
community (10).
This evidence documenting a small overall change over
time in physical activity levels and disparities in activity
patterns documents the need for continued focus on in-
creasing opportunities for physical activity among children
and adolescents. Interventions targeted to racial/ethnic mi-
nority children and adolescents at the policy, environment,
and school levels have promise of reducing physical activ-
ity and obesity-related disparities (39). The Task Force for
Community Preventive Services recommends increasing time
in school-based physical education, urban design and land-
use policies at the community and street levels, as well as
enhanced access to places for physical activity with informa-
tional outreach as promising strategies for promoting physi-
cal activity (12,31). Federal policies that require and enforce
regular K-12 physical education and comprehensive school
wellness policies can promote school environments that sup-
port physical activity (29). Community change efforts can
focus on creating and restoring environments that are sup-
portive of physical activity, which include safe parks, play-
ground, recreation areas and sidewalks (28). Particular focus
can be given to aesthetic and safety improvements because
these may address barriers to physical activity in otherwise
walkable, urban areas in poorer communities (21).
The recent nationally representative accelerometer data
suggest increases in overall accelerometer counts of physi-
cal activity among non-Hispanic white children 6­11 yr,
but not among Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks.
The insights gleaned from this study may help target pre-
vention efforts and provide useful information to ameliorate
racial/ethnic disparities in physical activity. Our results docu-
ment the need to develop interventions that can address these
emerging disparities, improve physical activity opportunities
for girls, and attenuate the decline in activity levels as chil-
dren enter adolescence.
