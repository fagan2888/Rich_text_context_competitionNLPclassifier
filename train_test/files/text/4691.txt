Abstract. A reflection between a pair of contours is more rapidly detected than a translation, but this
effect is stronger when the contours are closed to form a single object compared to when they are
closed to form 2 objects with a gap between them. That is, grouping changes the relative salience of
different regularities. We tested whether this manipulation would also change preference for reflection
or translation. We measured preference for these patterns using the Implicit Association Test (IAT).
On some trials, participants saw words that were either positive or negative and had to classify them
as quickly as possible. On interleaved trials, they saw reflection or translation patterns and again had
to classify them. Participants were faster when 1 button was used for reflection and positive words
and another button was used for translation and negative words, compared to when the reverse
response mapping was used (translation and positive vs. reflection and negative). This reaction time
difference indicates an implicit preference for reflection over translation. However, the size of the
implicit preference was significantly reduced in the Two-objects condition. We concluded that factors
that affect perceptual sensitivity also systematically affect implicit preference formation.

1 Introduction
The environment is full of symmetrical objects at all scales, and the visual systems of many animals
are tuned to process symmetry efficiently, possibly because it is a valid cue for figure-ground segmen-
tation or because it indicates the presence of other animals (for reviews, see Treder, 2010; Tyler, 1995;
Wagemans, 1995). Symmetrical patterns are produced by transformations that preserve the metric
structure of the pattern. In the plane, these transformations are reflection, translation, rotation and
glide reflection (Palmer, 1991; Wagemans, 1995). Although these patterns are equally regular, some
are more salient for the human visual system. Over 100 years ago, Ernst Mach noticed that bilat-
eral reflectional symmetry is most easily detected, particularly when the axis of reflection is vertical
(Mach, 1886/1959). The perceptual advantage for vertical reflection has subsequently been confirmed
by many psychophysical studies, most measuring reaction times (Palmer & Hemenway, 1978; Royer,
1981; Wenderoth, 1994).
Several papers have shown that relative perceptual advantage for reflection compared to transla-
tion can be altered by the context in which the contours are presented (Baylis & Driver, 1995; Ber-
tamini, Friedenberg, & Kubovy, 1997; Corballis & Roldan, 1974). When the reflected contours are part
of the same object, detection is quicker than when the reflected contours are part of separate objects
(Figure 1a and c). This within-object advantage does not hold for translation, and some studies have
reported that translation is more rapidly detected when the translated contours form part of two sepa-
rate objects (Figure 1b and d). This pattern of results is usually formalized as an interaction between
regularity type (reflection, translation) and number of objects (one, two), and the cause of this interac-
tion has been explored in several recent papers (Bertamini, 2010; Bertamini, Friedenberg, & Argyle,
2002; Friedenberg & Bertamini, 2000; Koning & Wagemans, 2009; Treder & van der Helm, 2007).
Grouping by closure influences subjective regularity and
implicit preference
520 Makin A, Pecchinenda A, Bertamini M
Symmetry holds a particular fascination because it is so closely related to subjective beauty. Art-
ists and architects have celebrated symmetry for thousands of years (Ramachandran & Hirstein, 1999),
and symmetry has consistently been shown to be the best predictor of preference for abstract, geo-
metrical patterns (Eisenman, 1967; Eysenk, 1941; Jacobsen & Hofel, 2002). The current study tests a
single hypothesis: Factors that affect the salience of visual regularities should also affect preference
for these patterns. Specifically, preference for reflection over translation should be altered by whether
the contours are part of the same object.
This prediction is based on the idea that sensitivity should be linked to preference. Many authors
have discussed this idea, and in particular it is central to the fluency account of aesthetics (Reber, Wurtz,
& Zimmermann, 2004). This fluency theory maintains that objects that are processed fluently (i.e.,
quickly detected and unambiguous) are preferred to those that are processed less fluently (i.e., difficult
to detect or ambiguous). There is some empirical support for the fluency hypothesis (Cannon, Hayes, &
Tipper, 2010; Topolinski, 2010; Winkielman & Cacioppo, 2001; Winkielman, Halberstadt, Fazendeiro,
& Catty, 2012). However, one advantage of the current work is the comparison between stimuli that are
equally regular in mathematical terms but are processed differently by the visual system.
Previous work on preference has typically involved explicit ratings. However, this approach has
various problems. Participants may respond according to assumed desires of the experimenter or make
cold judgements based on some available visual variable, in the absence of any emotional response
to the stimuli. We avoided these issues by measuring preferences using an Implicit Association Test
(IAT, Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998; Nosek, Greenwald, & Banaji, 2007). The IAT involves
participants classifying items by pressing one of two buttons. On some trials participants saw pat-
terns like those in Figure 1 and had to classify them as reflection or translation. On interleaved trials,
participants saw words and had to classify them as positive or negative. In the compatible blocks of
trials, the same button was used to report a reflection pattern or a positive word, and another button
was used to report a translation pattern or a negative word. In incompatible blocks, the response map-
ping was reversed (button 1 for translation or positive, button 2 for reflection or negative, see Table 1).
The crucial metric is the mean response time in the compatible blocks compared to mean response
time in the incompatible blocks. Faster response times in the compatible blocks than the incompatible
blocks indicates that the association between reflection patterns and positive words and the association
between translation patterns and negative words are stronger than the opposite pair of associations
(reflection and negative, translation and positive). The experiment is not based on the assumption that

Subjective regularity and implicit preference 521
reflection patterns are positive and translation patterns are negative in absolute terms (some observers
may perceive translation as positive in a different context). Instead, our IAT is a tool for measuring
relative implicit preference.
In previous work we reported implicit preference for reflection over translation using the IAT
(Makin, Pecchinenda, & Bertamini, 2012), but in this study, we focus on the role of grouping. Par-
ticipants completed two IAT experiments, one where reflection and translation were properties of a
single object (Figure 1a and b) and one where the same type of contours formed two separate objects
(Figure 1c and d). Note that the closure of the contours was not task-relevant, as is typical for the study
of effect of closure on perception of symmetry. We predicted that preference for reflection would be
attenuated in the Two-objects version of the experiment, in line with the perceptual differences.
Although we have cited some problems with overt aesthetic judgements, we nevertheless com-
pared the IAT results to explicit preference scores obtained from another sample of participants. Ex-
plicit ratings were obtained for reflection and translation patterns in one and two-object conditions.
This is informative because implicit and explicit preferences are not always matched: Indeed, Makin
et al. (2012) documented cases were IAT and explicit ratings were in agreement, but also cases where
opposite implicit and explicit preference patterns were found.
2 Methods
2.1Participants
Forty participants from the University of Liverpool took part in the IAT experiment (age, 18­41, mean
age, 23, 9 male, 2 left-handed). All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Some participants were
rewarded with course credit, and all were naive with regard to the experimental hypothesis. The ex-
periment had local ethics committee approval and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki (revised 2008). Another 40 participants filled in the explicit ratings questionnaire (age,
18­47, mean age, 30, 15 male, 5 left-handed).
2.2Apparatus
Participants sat in a darkened room approximately 57 cm from a 120-Hz CRT Sony Trinitron monitor.
A program written in C++ and OpenGL controlled the experiment. Participants entered responses us-
ing the left (`z') and right (`/') keys of the keyboard. Stimuli were generated using a random walk al-
gorithm dictating the inwards and outwards turns of a vertical line. There were 10 changes in direction
(see Figure 1). The height contours and the objects were approximately to 5° angle of visual angle. The
reference horizontal distance between the contours was 3.18° angle. From this reference, the vertices
of the convexities and concavities of each contour were displaced by a value between 0.91° angle
and 0.91° angle. The appearance of two objects was created with a rectangular closed contour, and the
total width of the Two-objects stimulus was 9.1° angle.

522 Makin A, Pecchinenda A, Bertamini M
Words were selected from the ANEW database (Bradley & Lang, 1999) and were identical to
those used by Makin et al. (2012). There were 10 positive words (HEAVEN, LOYAL, FREEDOM,
HONOR, LUCKY, KISS, RAINBOW, PLEASURE, PARADISE, FRIEND) and 10 negative words
(CANCER, DISASTER, POISON, HATRED, ACCIDENT, TORTURE, FILTH, SICKNESS, EVIL,
DEATH). The words differed significantly in term of valence but were matched for frequency and
arousal (see Makin et al., 2012, for additional statistical details).
2.3Procedure
The procedure was typical of IAT experiments (Nosek et al., 2007). A single IAT session comprised 10
blocks of 20 trials (Table 1). These blocks were not always presented in the same order. For half the
participants, the order was as follows: In the first block, participants saw reflection or translation pat-
terns, and they pressed the left button for reflection, and the right button for translation. In the second
block, the positive and negative words were presented, and participants responded with left button for
positive and right button for negative. Next, there were three blocks of experimental trials. In these
compatible blocks, patterns (reflection or translation) and words (positive or negative) were presented
in alternate trials. The left button was used to report reflection or positive words, while the right button
was used to report translation patterns or negative words. Next, two more training blocks were pre-
sented that included only reflection or translation patterns. Here, the response mapping was reversed,
participants learned to use the left button to report translation patterns, and the right key to report reflec-
tion. There were then another three blocks of incompatible experimental trials (left button for transla-
tion or positive, right button for reflection or negative). For the other 20 participants, the incompatible
block was presented first and the training blocks were rearranged accordingly. Participants completed
two IAT experiments. In the One-object experiment, stimuli were composed of a single central item. In
the Two-objects experiment, stimuli were composed of two objects with either a reflected or translated
abutting contour (Figure 1). The order in which the experiments were completed was counterbalanced
with other factors.
Each trial began with a fixation cross, which was present for 1,000 ms. The word or pattern then
appeared and remained on the screen until participants pressed the button. Cue words were presented
on the left and right sides of the screen to indicate the response mapping. For example, when a pattern
appeared in the first training block, the cues "reflection" and "translation" were presented, whereas
when a word appeared in the second training block, the cues "positive" and "negative" were presented.
In the compatible blocks, the cue word on the left read "reflection or positive" and the cue word on the
right read "translation or negative". Conversely, in the incompatible blocks, the cue words read "trans-
lation or positive" and "reflection or negative". Incorrect responses were signalled with the message
"WRONG". Participants were instructed to make accurate responses as quickly as possible.
Explicit preference ratings for the same pattern types were obtained from a group of 40 new par-
ticipants. Patterns were rated on a Likert scale [3 (very ugly) to 13 (very beautiful), with zero as
neutral]. Participants rated 10 examples of each of the four pattern types (Reflection, Translation 
One-object Two-objects). These were generated in the same way as the images used in the IAT.
2.4Analysis
Trials were excluded from all analysis if participants pressed the wrong button, or if reaction time
was 10 s (standard in the IAT literature, Nosek et al., 2007). Approximately 5% of the trials were
excluded in total. Preference for reflection over translation was defined as faster mean response times
in the compatible than incompatible blocks. However, following the conventions of the IAT literature,
we normalized this reaction time difference by dividing it by the SD of response times in all experi-
mental blocks to give a D score (Nosek et al., 2007). Positive D scores indicate an association between
reflection and positive words and between translation and negative words. We take this as a measure
of implicit preference for reflection over translation. D scores were compared to zero using one-sample
t tests (significant effects indicating a preference for reflection over translation), and in the One- and
Two-objects experiments using paired sample t tests (significant effects indicating greater reflection
preference in either the One- or Two-object experiments).
3 Results
Each participant completed two IAT experiments designed to measure preference for reflection over
translation. In the One-object experiment, the contours that were either reflected or translated were
Subjective regularity and implicit preference 523
connected to form a single object, while in the Two-objects experiment, the same contours were
connected to form two objects (Figure 1). We predicted that preference for reflection would be reduced
in the Two-objects experiment.
Results are shown in Figure 2a. It can be seen that in both the One- and Two-objects experiments,
D was greater than zero, indicating an implicit preference for reflection, t (39)  3.668, p  .002. As
predicted, this implicit preference for reflection was significantly greater in the One-object experiment
than in the Two-objects experiment, t (39) 5 2.622, p 5.012.
It was likely that the order in which participants completed the experiments (One-object first,
Two-objects first) would have a nontrivial effect on implicit preference. The results for these two
groups of participants are shown separately in Figure 2b, and this pattern was explored further with
planned t tests. The group of participants who completed the One-object experiment first showed a
large difference between the One and Two-objects experiments, t (19) 5 2.905, p 5.009, while there
was little difference for the group who completed the Two-objects experiment first, t (19)  1, N.S1,2.
In some of the training blocks, participants discriminated between reflection and translation pat-
terns, without the presentation of words in interleaved trials (Table 1). Previous work suggests that the
detection speed advantage for reflectional symmetry should be larger in the One-object experiment
than in the Two-objects experiment. To facilitate comparison with preference, we computed detection
speed difference between the reflection and translation trials and divided this score by SD in all trials.
Positive scores indicate that people were quicker to respond to reflection than translation. Overall, the
advantage for reflection was larger in the One-object experiment than in the Two-objects experiment,
although the anticipated effect was not significant, t (39) 5 1.548, p 5 .130, Figure 2c. However, when
the results were broken down by Experiment Order, we found a significant effect in the group who
completed the One-object experiment first, t (19) 5 2.388, p 5 .028, not for the group who completed
the Two-objects experiment first, t (19)  1 N.S, Figure 2d. This parallels the implicit preference data
from the same participants.
Explicit ratings were obtained for the same four pattern types (Reflection, Translation)  (One-
object, Two-objects) from another group of 40 participants. In both One- and Two-object conditions,
reflection was preferred to translation, t (39)  6.485, p  .001. However, reflection preference was
1The IAT analysis was ultimately based on the mean response times in the compatible and incompatible blocks,
where the means included response times to the words and images. It is informative, although unconventional,
to break down the results further: We analysed response times to the words and images separately. The response
times to the images were analysed as a function of three within-subjects factors [Response mapping, (compatible,
incompatible)  Regularity (reflection, translation)  Object number (One-object, Two-objects)], and a between-
subjects factor [Experiment order (One-object first, Two-objects first)] with mixed ANOVA. There was a main
effect of Response mapping, F (1, 38) 5 21.246, p  .001, because participants were quicker to respond to
images in the compatible blocks, and a main effect of Object number, because people were quicker to classify the
One-object patterns, F (1, 38) 5 25.342, p  0.001). There was no main effect of Regularity, F (1, 38)  1, N.S,
and no Regularity  Object number interaction, F (1, 38)  1, N.S. There was a significant interaction between
Object Number and Experiment order, F (1, 38) 5 32.781, p  .001), reflecting the fact that slowed RT in the
Two-object experiment was only apparent in participants who did the Two-object experiment first. There was also
a significant interaction between Response mapping, Object number and Experiment order, F (1, 38) 5 8.672,
p 5 .005. This interaction is actually another manifestation of the pattern in Figure 1b, although it was obtained
from responses to the images only. The pattern can be described as follows: the group of participants who did the
One-object experiment first had reduced compatibility advantage in the Two-object experiment, while the group
who did the Two-object experiment first had comparable compatibility advantage in the One- and Two-objects
experiments. The response times to words were analysed in the same way, with the factor Valence (positive,
negative) in place of Regularity. There was a main effect of Response mapping, because participants were faster
in the compatible blocks, F (1, 38) 5 14.802, p  .001. There was no effect of Object number, F (1, 38)  1, N.S,
or Valence, F (1, 38)  1, N.S. The significant interactions were between Object number and Experiment order,
Response mapping and Object number and a three-way interaction between Response mapping, Object number
and Experiment order, F (1, 38)  4.985, p  .033). Again the three-way interaction is another manifestation of
the results in Figure 1b, although it reflects response times to words only.
2We analysed error rates as a function of the within-subjects factors Response mapping (compatible, incompatible)
and Object number (One object, Two-objects) and the between-subjects factor Experiment order (One-object first,
Two-objects first) with mixed methods ANOVA. As expected, participants made fewer errors in the compatible
blocks than in the incompatible blocks [4% vs. 6%, F (1, 38) 5 7.60, p 5 .009]. There were no other effects or
interactions, F (1, 38)  2.227, p  .143.

stronger for the One-object than for the Two-objects stimuli, t (39) 5 3.112, p 5 .003. This explicit
preference data are similar to the of implicit preferences measure by the IAT.
4 Discussion
We used the IAT to investigate implicit preference for reflection over translation. In all conditions,
participants were quicker to respond when the same button was used for reflection patterns and posi-
tive words than when the response mapping was reversed. We interpret this as a measure of implicit
preference for reflection (Nosek et al., 2007). This preference for reflection over translation replicates
one of the IAT experiments reported by Makin et al. (2012). The novel finding in the current work
was that grouping modulated the magnitude of the implicit preference: more specifically, reflection
preference was significantly greater when the contours were closed to form a single object than when
they were part of two spatially separated objects. Some previous studies have found that reflection is
more fluently processed than translation within a single object, but that this difference is attenuated
or sometimes reversed in two-object conditions (Baylis & Driver, 1995; Bertamini, 2010; Bertamini
et al., 2002; Bertamini et al., 1997; Koning & Wagemans, 2009; Treder & van der Helm, 2007). The
fact that the same visual factors affect preference scores highlights the close relationship between
perceptual salience and preference.
This result is consistent with the fluency hypothesis, which states that the fluency of perceptual
or cognitive processing is an important mediator of aesthetic responses (Reber et al., 2004). While
a link between perceptual fluency and preference has been reported in the literature, most work has
used explicit ratings, and it is difficult to know whether these results generalize to preferences formed
spontaneously, that is, in the absence of any requirement to make a decision about the relative merits
of the stimuli (Hofel & Jacobsen, 2007). The IAT therefore has certain advantages over other protocols
more commonly used in empirical aesthetics (Mastandrea, Bartoli, & Carrus, 2011).

Subjective regularity and implicit preference 525
There was one important caveat to our IAT results: The effect of number of objects on implicit
preference was greater for the group of participants who completed the One-object experiment first.
Moreover, detection speed during training blocks was subject to similar order effects. Although we did
not predict these order effects, the fact that prior experience had a common effect on both detection
speed and implicit preference indicates a close relationship between these variables (see Watson &
Kramer, 1999, for further analysis of past history effects in object-based attention).
Some readers would have noticed that the effects on detection speed were measured in training
blocks, while effects on preference were measured in blocks of compatible and incompatible response
mappings (Table 1). Moreover, when the response times to the images in these blocks were analysed in
isolation, there was no detection speed differences between reflection and translation, and no interac-
tion between regularity type and number of objects, that is, the results usually reported in the literature
(see footnote 1). This seems to imply (problematically) that the fluency differences that putatively
give rise to relative preferences do not manifest in the crucial blocks. However, response times in
these blocks provide a poor measure of detection speed because the same keys are used to report word
valence on interleaved trials. Therefore, we are not surprised that detection speed differences between
reflection and translation are not apparent here.
Makin et al. (2012) discussed various issues with the IAT methodology, but there is one issue that
requires further consideration: Would participants like the fluently processed patterns if this did not
entail good performance in a speeded task? Put another way, people may like perceptual ease itself, or
they may like the fact it allows them to perform the task well. The IAT cannot discriminate these pos-
sibilities. Nevertheless, good performance cannot explain the explicit preference ratings we obtained
from a new group of 40 participants, which were similar to the implicit preferences measured by IAT.
We therefore favour the theory that perceptual fluency produces a positive attitude to the patterns,
which can be measured with implicit or explicit techniques (best used together to obtain converging
evidence).
It is worth considering the perceptual literature in more detail here. The One-object advantage for
reflection could be due to a more general process whereby spatial attention is drawn to single objects,
while some other perceptual influence may counteract this ubiquitous effect during translation detec-
tion. One possibility is that translation is discovered through a lock and key matching process, akin
to mental object rotation, where translated contours are mentally shifted until they overlap (Baylis &
Driver, 1995; Bertamini et al., 1997)? Some participants report consciously using the lock and key
strategy, although in a study that looked at this the awareness of this strategy was not linked to better
performance (Bertamini et al., 2002). However, there are problems with the lock and key hypothesis.
Koning and Wagemans (2009) presented two-object regularities and reported that translation patterns
are still more quickly detected than reflection, even when the task-relevant contours in question were
on the outside face of the patterns, and the internal, facing contours were not translational, making
lock and key matching difficult. Following their structural coding account, these authors argued that
the one- and two-object displays are suited to different regularities because reflection typically signals
the presence of one object and translation signals presence of two objects in real-life environments.
Consideration of the example stimuli in Figure 1 reveals another factor: For reflection, whenever there
is a convexity on one side, there is a convexity on the other. Contour polarity is positively correlated
for the reflection patterns, and the visual system uses this cue. For translation, there is a negative cor-
relation between the contours (convexity on one side is matched with concavity on the other), mak-
ing them the opposite of reflection. This feature may make the translation regularity more difficult to
detect. However, the disadvantage is attenuated when the translation spans two objects (Bertamini et
al., 2002). The relative strength of these factors and their interactions remain unresolved (Bertamini,
2010), but what is crucial for the current study is that whatever accounts for detection speed differ-
ences also accounts for implicit preferences.
5 Conclusion
This study tested a single hypothesis, based on the idea that the visual system's sensitivity to regularity
is directly linked to human preference formation. A specific implementation of this idea is provided
by the fluency account of aesthetics. Any variable that influences detection speed should also influence
implicit preference. We measured implicit preferences for reflection and translation using the IAT. It is
known that reflection is more quickly detected than translation, but that this effect is reduced when the
contours are closed to form two separate objects. We found exactly the same interaction between type
526 Makin A, Pecchinenda A, Bertamini M
of regularity and number of objects on implicit preference. A separate study found the same pattern
of preferences using an overt ratings procedure, that is, an explicit judgement. This provides evidence
that the IAT is sensitive to changes in preference produced by relative perceptual saliency and not just
preferences produced by good performance.

Alexis Makin (1983) studied undergraduate Psychology and Neuroscience
at the University of Manchester (2003­2006). He completed a PhD thesis on
eye movement control and memory for velocity in 2010. He now works at the
University of Liverpool studying aesthetics and visual symmetry perception, in
collaboration with Marco Bertamini and Anna Pecchinenda.
Anna Pecchinenda studied psychology at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy.
She then worked at Universitè Laval in Québec, Canada, and in 2000 she
moved to the University of Hull, UK. Since 2010 she has been at Sapienza,
University of Rome. Her research interests are broad across affect and
cognition.
Marco Bertamini studied psychology at the University of Padova, Italy, and
then at the University of Virginia, USA. He moved to Liverpool in 1999, where
he established the Visual Perception Lab. His interests are broad across visual
perception and cognition. For more information visit http://www.liv.ac.uk/VP.
