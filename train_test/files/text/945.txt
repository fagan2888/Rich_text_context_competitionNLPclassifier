CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS AND
Neisseria gonorrhoeae infec-
tions cause substantial mor-
bidity in the United States.1
In women, chlamydial and gonococ-
cal infections may cause pelvic inflam-
matory disease, tubal infertility, chronic
pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy.2,3
Chlamydial infection may also be linked
to cervical cancer.4 Chlamydial and
gonococcal infections may increase sus-
ceptibility to and transmission of hu-
man immunodeficiency virus in both
men and women.5 Because these infec-
tions are easy to diagnose and curable
with a single dose of oral antibiotics,
early detection and treatment are an im-
portant component of efforts to re-
duce the disease burden.
Early detection of these infections is
challenging because most women and
men with chlamydial infection and
many women with gonorrhea are
asymptomatic.2,6 However, infected per-
sons who are asymptomatic can still
transmit the infection to sexual part-
ners and are at risk for complica-

Context Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are important causes of pelvic in-
flammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Although screening for Chla-
mydia trachomatis is widely recommended among young adult women, little infor-
mation is available regarding the prevalence of chlamydial and gonococcal infections
in the general young adult population.
Objective To determine the prevalence of chlamydial and gonoccoccal infections in
a nationally representative sample of young adults living in the United States.
Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analyses of a prospective co-
hort study of a nationally representative sample of 14322 young adults aged 18 to 26
years. In-home interviews were conducted across the United States for Wave III of
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) from April 2, 2001,
to May 9, 2002. This study sample represented 66.3% of the original 18924 partici-
pants in Wave I of Add Health. First-void urine specimens using ligase chain reaction
assay were available for 12548 (87.6%) of the Wave III participants.
Main Outcome Measures Prevalences of chlamydial and gonococcal infections
in the general young adult population, and by age, self-reported race/ethnicity, and
geographic region of current residence.
Results Overall prevalence of chlamydial infection was 4.19% (95% confidence in-
terval [CI], 3.48%-4.90%). Women (4.74%; 95% CI, 3.93%-5.71%) were more likely
to be infected than men (3.67%; 95% CI, 2.93%-4.58%; prevalence ratio, 1.29; 95%
CI, 1.03-1.63). The prevalence of chlamydial infection was highest among black women
(13.95%; 95% CI, 11.25%-17.18%) and black men (11.12%; 95% CI, 8.51%-
14.42%); lowest prevalences were among Asian men (1.14%; 95% CI, 0.40%-3.21%),
white men (1.38%; 95% CI, 0.93%-2.03%), and white women (2.52%; 95% CI,
1.90%-3.34%). Prevalence of chlamydial infection was highest in the south (5.39%;
95% CI, 4.24%-6.83%) and lowest in the northeast (2.39%; 95% CI, 1.56%-3.65%).
Overall prevalence of gonorrhea was 0.43% (95% CI, 0.29%-0.63%). Among black
men and women, the prevalence was 2.13% (95% CI, 1.46%-3.10%) and among
white young adults, 0.10% (95% CI, 0.03%-0.27%). Prevalence of coinfection with
both chlamydial and gonococcal infections was 0.030% (95% CI, 0.18%-0.49%).
Conclusions The prevalence of chlamydial infection is high among young adults in
the United States. Substantial racial/ethnic disparities are present in the prevalence of
both chlamydial and gonococcal infections.

tions.2,6 Consequently, many major
medical organizations recommend
screening of adolescent and young adult
women who are asymptomatic for chla-
mydial infection.7-13 The identifica-
tion of annual chlamydia screening
among sexually experienced young
women as a Health Plan Employer Data
and Information Set measure14 for qual-
ity of care provided by managed care
organizations highlights the recog-
nized importance of screening. In con-
trast, chlamydia screening for men has
been endorsed less consistently.9
Screening for gonorrhea is recom-
mended for high-risk women.8
Current screening recommenda-
tions are based primarily on reported
cases and clinic-based prevalence esti-
mates. These estimates are suboptimal
for informing policies because cases are
underreported and clinic populations
havelimitedgeneralizability.Population-
basedstudiesprovidemoreaccurateand
representative prevalence estimates.
However, to our knowledge, the only
previous national prevalence estimate of
chlamydialinfectionintheUnitedStates
waslimitedtoyoungmenandhadarela-
tively small sample size.15 Other preva-
lence estimates have been limited to
single urban areas.16,17 Wave III of The
National Longitudinal Survey of Ado-
lescentHealth(AddHealth)providesthe
first opportunity to determine the na-
tional prevalence of chlamydial and
gonococcal infection in young adult
women and men in the United States.
Using Wave III Add Health data, we as-
sessed the general population esti-
mates of the prevalence of chlamydial
and gonococcal infection among young
adults from different racial and ethnic
groups. Additionally, we provided esti-
mates of overlap of gonorrhea and chla-
mydial infections.
METHODS
Study Design and Sample
Add Health is a prospective cohort
study that has followed almost 20000
adolescents into adulthood.18 We de-
scribe cross-sectional analyses based on
Wave III of Add Health (April 2, 2001,
to May 9, 2002), which targeted all
original Wave I participants currently
living in the continental United States,
Hawaii, and Alaska. The University of
North Carolina institutional review
board approved all study procedures.
The sampling design for Add Health
has been described in detail else-
where.18,19 The primary sampling frame
for the original Add Health sample in-
cluded all high schools in the United
States with an 11th grade and at least 30
enrollees in the school. From this sam-
plingframe,asystematicrandomsample
of80highschoolsand52middleschools
intheUnitedStateswaschosenwithun-
equal probability of selection. The sam-
pling of schools was stratified to en-
surethattheschoolswererepresentative
of US schools with respect to region, ur-
banicity,schooltype,percentageofwhite
students, and school size. For each high
schoolselected,thelargestfeederschool,
usually a middle school, was also re-
cruited.
The original study participants were
identified from rosters of students in
grades 7 through 12 enrolled in the se-
lected schools, early in the 1994-1995
school year. The random sample of stu-
dents was stratified by grade and sex.
Black youth in families with relatively
higher socioeconomic status and cer-
tain Latino groups were oversampled
to increase the precision of estimates for
these ethnic groups. For Wave III, post-
stratification sampling weights were cal-
culated to account for persons who
could not be located or refused to par-
ticipate. With these sampling weights,
accounting for the school as the pri-
mary sampling unit and using region
of the country as a stratification vari-
able, the Add Health cohort provided
a representative sample of young adults
aged 18 to 26 years in the United States.
Interviews and
Specimen Collection
All original Wave I Add Health respon-
dents who could be contacted were
asked to identify a time and place for
the Wave III interview. An inter-
viewer traveled to their home or an-
other suitable location identified by the
potential participant. After obtaining
written consent for the interviews, in-
terviewers conducted the approxi-
mately 90-minute sessions in as pri-
vate an area as possible. Interviewers
entered questionnaire responses di-
rectlyintoacomputer.Participantsused
computer-assisted self-interview to an-
swer potentially sensitive questions (eg,
questions about sexual behavior).
Consent for testing for chlamydial
and gonoccocal infections was ob-
tained after interview completion. Par-
ticipants received $10 for providing a
urine specimen. Participants who pro-
vided a urine specimen received infor-
mation regarding chlamydial, gonococ-
cal, and other sexually transmitted
infections and were encouraged to call
a toll-free telephone number for test re-
sults. Participants were also informed
that they were not being tested for all
sexually transmitted infections and
should not view their participation in
the Add Health study as a substitute for
health care. Results of assays for chla-
mydial and gonococcal infections were
not reported to local public health de-
partments, based on the terms of a Cer-
tificate of Confidentiality obtained from
the US Department of Health and Hu-
man Services. A more detailed descrip-
tion of Add Health sexually transmit-
ted infection testing is available
elsewhere.20
Urine specimens were collected in a
30-mL container with a mark at 15 mL.
The target volume for testing was 15 to
20 mL of first-void urine. Interviewers
instructed participants in the appro-
priate collection techniques. Urine
samples were placed in coolers after col-
lection. Specimens were maintained at
approximately 4Â°C until they were
packaged with fresh ice packs and
shipped by overnight express to arrive
at the laboratory by 10 AM the follow-
ing morning. Samples were received in
the laboratory within 4 days of collec-
tion. Upon arrival, urine specimens
were inspected for adherence to appro-
priate shipping conditions, including
the presence of the appropriate bar code
label, date and time of collection, tem-
perature on arrival, and volume of
urine. All urine samples were pro-

CtrachomatisandNgonorrhoeaewere
identified in urine specimens by using
ligase chain reaction (LCR) assays (Ab-
bott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill). Li-
gase chain reaction assays were per-
formed according to the manufacturer's
instructions, except that specimens ex-
ceeding the recommended volume of
20 mL were tested. The testing labora-
tory performed sample processing in a
dedicatedpreamplificationareathatwas
monitored routinely for contamina-
tion by wipe testing. An open vial was
maintained on the bench top and then
carried through sample processing to
monitor contamination. A laboratory-
prepared positive control was also pro-
cessed with each run as an external
monitor of sample processing and de-
tection. The postamplification area, in-
cluding instrumentation, was moni-
tored by wipe testing in a similar fashion
to the preamplification area. Routine in-
strumentation monitoring and preven-
tive maintenance was performed per the
manufacturer's recommendations. The
LCR results were reviewed for accept-
ability by the responsible technologist
as well as a second individual. Ligase
chain reaction results were expressed
as a signal to cutoff ratio determined by
relating the sample rate for each speci-
men to the cutoff value of assay cali-
brator duplicates. The Abbott ana-
lyzer automatically performed these
calculations. All chlamydial and gono-
coccal samples with a signal to cutoff
ratio of at least 0.80 were retested to
minimize the potential for false-
positive test results.20 Retested samples
with a signal to cutoff ratio of at least
1.00 were considered positive. All test
results were entered into a database by
an individual technologist who used a
bar code scanner to ensure accurate re-
sult-sample identification. Two addi-
tional reviewers verified the computer
entry.
After completion of data collection,
Abbott Laboratories issued a recall for
certain lots of N gonorrhoeae LCR as-
says. Results from these assays (n=859,
6.0%), whether positive or negative,
were excluded from the gonorrhea
prevalence estimates.
Outcome Measures
In addition to measuring the preva-
lence of chlamydial and gonococcal in-
fections, our analyses included 3 demo-
graphic variables: age based on reported
birth date, race/ethnicity (self-reported
as white, black, Native American, Asian
American,orLatino),andgeographicre-
gion of current residence (northeast,
south, midwest, or west). In some cases,
participant self-identified more than 1
racial/ethnic group. In that circum-
stance, we used a follow-up question
identifying the group with which a par-
ticipant primarily identified. We also in-
cluded 3 measures assessing symp-
toms of infection in the 24-hour period
preceding the interview: painful urina-
tion(dysuria),urethraldischarge(men),
and vaginal discharge (women).
Statistical Analyses
To ensure the national representation
of our prevalence estimates for chla-
mydial and gonococcal infections, we
used Stata version 7.0 (Stata Corp, Col-
lege Station, Tex) to account for the
complex survey design of Add Health,
incorporating the school as the pri-
mary sampling unit, region as a strati-
fication variable, and appropriate post-
stratification weights. We calculated
95% confidence intervals (CIs) using
a logit transformation. Prevalence ra-
tios with 95% CIs were calculated us-
ing Poisson regression for survey data.21
Assessment of Test Performance
and Nonresponse Biases
Given the relatively high prevalence of
chlamydial infection and the potential
impact of our observations on chla-
mydia screening policies, we con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the
effects of 2 potential sources of bias, test
performance and nonresponse, on the
prevalence estimates for chlamydial in-
fection. We used plausible estimates of
sensitivity (0.80, 0.90) and specificity
(0.98, 0.99, 0.995) of the LCR assay to
assess the potential impact of test im-
perfection on the prevalence esti-
mates.20,22,23 We present the data from a
very low estimate (sensitivity=0.80
and specificity=0.98) and a realistic es-
timate (sensitivity=0.90 and specific-
ity = 0.995). These analyses were
performed in conjunction with the as-
sessment of the effects of nonresponse.
In Wave III of Add Health, 6% of the
original Wave I study population re-
fused participation and an additional
19% could not be located or were un-
abletoparticipateforotherreasons.Nine
percent of the original study popula-
tion did not have a urine specimen avail-
able for chlamydial testing; 14% did not
have a specimen or result for gonococ-
cal testing. This nonresponse can po-
tentially bias the prevalence estimates
under 2 conditions: if the response rate
varies by an observed attribute, such as
race or sex, which is associated with
prevalence; or if the nonrespondents
have a different pattern of prevalence
from respondents with similar ob-
served attributes. In the latter case, an
unobservedattributemayinfluenceboth
survey participation and level of risk.
To address the first source of poten-
tial nonresponse bias, we used post-
stratification weights developed by the
Add Health research team to ensure that
the observed sample has the proper race
and sex distribution.
We addressed the second potential
source of nonresponse bias through sen-
sitivity analysis using the method de-
scribedbyBrookmeyerandGail.24 Given

RESULTS
Study Population
Of the 18924 Add Health participants in
the nationally representative weighted
WaveIsample,1109(5.9%)refusedpar-
ticipation,3493(18.5%)couldnotbelo-
cated or were unable to participate, and
14322 (75.7%) were located and agreed
to participate in Wave III. Of these, 1130
(7.9%) refused to provide a urine speci-
men, 226 (1.6%) were unable to pro-
vide a specimen at the time of the inter-
view, and 418 specimens (2.9%) could
notbeprocessedduetoshippingorlabo-
ratory problems. In all, specimens from
12548 Wave III participants (87.6%),
representing66.3%oftheoriginal18924
participants, were available for C tracho-
matis testing. For N gonorrhoeae test-
ing, 11689 of the Wave III participants
(81.6%) were included in the preva-
lence estimates.
Including participants who did and
did not provide urine specimens, 52.8%
of the study sample were women
(TABLE 1). The majority (54.2%) of par-
ticipants were white, with substantial
representation of black (21.3%), La-
tino (16.3%), Asian American (7.2%),
and Native American (1.0%) partici-
pants. The mean age of the partici-
pants was 22.0 years (SD, 1.8 years).
Prevalence of Chlamydial Infection
The overall prevalence of chlamydial in-
fectioninoursampleofyoungadultswas
4.19% (95% CI, 3.48%-4.90%). Preva-
lence varied little by age (TABLE 2), but
was more common among women
(4.74%)thanmen(3.67%;prevalencera-
tio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.63). Preva-
lence was more than 2 times higher in
the south (5.39%) than in the northeast
(2.39%) region (prevalence ratio, 2.26;
95% CI, 1.39-3.66).
The prevalence of chlamydial infec-
tion varied significantly by race/
ethnicity (Table 2). Prevalence was low-
est in white young adults (1.94%) and
more than 6 times higher in black
young adults (12.54%; prevalence ra-
tio, 6.46; 95% CI, 4.68-8.91). The
prevalence was also high in Native
American young adults (10.41%), al-
though this estimate is imprecise. In-
termediate prevalences were observed
in Latino young adults (5.89%). The
prevalence among Asian American
young adults (2.10%) was compa-
rable with that of white young adults.
We observed similar patterns after
stratifying by both race/ethnicity and
sex (TABLE 3). The highest prevalence
in any group was among black women
(13.95%), followed by black men
(11.12%). The lowest prevalences were
among Asian American men (1.14%),
white men (1.38%), and white women
(2.52%).
Nearly all participants (95%) with
chlamydial infection did not report
symptoms in the 24 hours preceding
specimen collection. Among men with
chlamydial infection, the prevalences
of urethral discharge and dysuria were
only 3.33% and 1.88%, respectively.
The prevalences of urethral discharge
and dysuria among men without chla-
mydial infection were 0.02% and 0.97%,
respectively. Among women with chla-
mydial infection, the prevalences of
vaginal discharge and dysuria were
0.26% and 4.21%, respectively. The
prevalences of vaginal discharge and
dysuria among women without chla-
mydial infection were similar at 1.4%
and 3.28%, respectively.
Among young adults who reported
symptoms, the prevalence of chla-
mydial infection was much higher for
men than women. Among the small
number of young men reporting ure-
thral discharge (n=17), the preva-
lence of chlamydial infection was high
(38.46%), whereas the prevalence of
chlamydial infection was only 6.01%
among the women reporting dysuria
(n=232) and 0.93% among those re-
porting vaginal discharge (n=98).
Prevalence of Gonorrhea
The overall prevalence of gonorrhea
among young US adults was low
(0.43%; 95% CI, 0.29%-0.63%). The
prevalence of gonorrhea varied little by
sex and age but was lower in the west
(Table 2). However, substantial differ-
ences were observed by race/ethnic-

ity. The prevalence of gonorrhea was
approximately 2% for both black men
and women, which was 36 times greater
and 14 times greater than white men
and women, respectively (Table 3).
In this general population sample of
young adults, most persons with gon-
orrhea were asymptomatic. Among men
with gonorrhea, 4.43% reported dys-
uria and none reported a penile dis-
charge in the previous 24 hours. Among
women, 12.36% reported dysuria and
0.88% reported vaginal discharge.
Chlamydial and Gonococcal
Coinfection
The overall prevalence of coinfection
with both chlamydial and gonococcal
infections was 0.30% (95% CI, 0.18%-
0.49%). Among persons with gonor-
rhea, the prevalence of chlamydial in-
fection was extremely high (69.97%;
95% CI, 51.66%-83.56%). This preva-
lence was similar among men (69.81%;
95% CI, 43.52%-87.40%) and women
(70.15%; 95% CI, 43.69%-87.68%).
The prevalence of gonorrhea was also
relatively high among those partici-
pants with chlamydial infection (7.29%;
95% CI, 4.69%-11.16%). Among men
with chlamydial infection, the preva-
lence of gonorrhea was 8.65% (95% CI,
4.77%-15.19%) and among women, it
was 6.24% (95% CI, 3.05%-12.36%).
Sensitivity Analyses
To ensure that the prevalence esti-
mates for chlamydial infection were not
too high, we conducted sensitivity
analyses to assess the impact of nonre-
sponse and diagnostic test perfor-
mance on the prevalence estimates for
chlamydial infection using several plau-
sible estimates for nonresponse and test
performance (TABLE 4).
To provide a direct estimate of the po-
tential effect of nonresponse bias, we es-
timated the prevalence with different
nonresponse conditions, without con-
sidering test performance. If persons
without urine specimens were missing
at random, the prevalence estimate is
minimally affected (4.18%; 95% CI,
2.94%-5.53%). If the prevalence of chla-
mydialinfectionwastwiceashighamong
persons without a urine specimen vs
thosewithaurinespecimen(=2.0),the
overall estimate for chlamydial infec-
tion would increase to 5.99% (95% CI,
4.18%-7.96%). If the prevalence of chla-
mydial infection was half as high among
nonresponders (=0.5), the overall
prevalence would decrease to 3.28%
(95% CI, 2.31%-4.32%).
To provide an estimate of the maxi-
mum potential bias, we then consid-
ered the potential effects of poor test
performance (sensitivity=0.80 and
specificity = 0.98) while simulta-
neously accounting for the effects of
nonresponse.Estimateswerelowerthan

missing at random or one half as likely
to be infected (=0.5). Estimates re-
mained slightly higher than unad-
justed estimates if nonrespondents were
considered twice as likely to be in-
fected (=2.0). Estimates remained
high for black adults regardless of test
performance. The prevalence esti-
mates were 0 for the white and Asian
American men, suggesting test perfor-
mance was unlikely to be this poor.
We then examined estimates with
conditions that approximated ex-
pected test performance (sensitiv-
ity=0.90 and specificity=0.995). In this
circumstance, estimates were gener-
ally comparable with those obtained
with adjustment for nonresponse alone.
Typically, estimates for low preva-
lence populations were reduced slightly
and those for high prevalence popula-
tions were increased.
COMMENT
Add Health provides the most compre-
hensive assessment to date of the preva-
lence of chlamydial and gonococcal in-
fections in young US adults. More than
4%ofallyoungadultswereinfectedwith
C trachomatis. The prevalence of chla-
mydial infection was higher among
young women than men but this differ-
ence was not substantial. In this nation-
ally representative sample, the preva-
lence of chlamydial infection was more
than 6 times greater in black vs white
young adults, and also high in Native
American and Latino young adults. Al-
though the overall prevalence of gon-
orrhea was low, the prevalence of gon-
orrhea was markedly higher among
black young adults than other groups.
The marked differences inthesesexu-
ally transmitted infections across racial
and ethnic groups are disturbing. Al-
though reporting bias and minority
groups' disproportionate use of pub-
licly funded clinics may affect previous
prevalence estimates derived from clin-
ics, these sources of bias cannot explain
the racial/ethnic disparities observed in
ourgeneral populationsample. TheAdd
Health study design ensured that preva-
lenceestimateswouldbeindependentof
reporting by clinicians and health care

seeking behavior. Furthermore, be-
cause black young adults with rela-
tively higher socioeconomic status and
certain Latino groups were over-
sampled, the precision of the preva-
lence estimates for black and Latino
young adults was enhanced. Our re-
sults provide compelling evidence that
nationwidedisparitiesinchlamydialand
gonococcal infections across racial/
ethnic groups are real rather than the re-
sult of biased estimates.
The observed disparities in chla-
mydial and gonococcal infections by
racialandethnicgroupsmayberespon-
sible, in part, for considerable differ-
ences in reproductive health. Black
women have 33% excess incidence in
ectopicpregnancycomparedwithwhite
women.25 Asubstantialproportionofthe
excess mortality related to childbirth
among black women in New York City
is attributable to ectopic pregnancy.26
Giventhewell-recognizedassociationof
chlamydial and gonococcal infections
with tubal scarring, infertility, and ecto-
pic pregnancy,2,3 efforts to reduce chla-
mydialinfectionandgonorrheainthese
populations may have important effects
on morbidity and possibly mortality.
The low prevalence of gonorrhea is
not unexpected. Unlike chlamydial in-
fection, gonorrhea is frequently symp-
tomatic, especially in men, and com-
monly necessitates medical care.6
Furthermore, the duration of gonococ-
cal infections is believed to be shorter,27
which will result in a relative reduc-
tion in prevalence, compared with chla-
mydial infection. However, the very low
prevalence of gonorrhea in these na-
tional estimates contrasts with a sub-
stantially higher prevalence observed in
a population-based study in Balti-
more, Md, in which the estimated
prevalence was 5.3% among adults aged
18 to 35 years.16 Baltimore has consis-
tently had high reported incidence of
gonorrhea,28 and undoubtedly, the ob-
served differences in prevalence re-
lates to the highly clustered, geographi-
callyvarieddistributionofgonorrhea.1,28
Previous population-based studies of
the prevalence of chlamydial infection
have been limited in scope.15 Among
young men, the prevalence of chla-
mydial infection was 3.1% among 18-
to 19-year-olds and 4.5% among 20- to
26-year-olds, but the sample size was
considerably smaller than the Add
Health study sample, prevalence was
not reported by race/ethnicity, and 95%
CIs were not reported.15 Other popu-
lation-based studies in Baltimore and
San Francisco, Calif, were limited geo-
graphically and by sample size.16,17
Consistent with these more limited
population-based prevalence stud-
ies,15-17 our results confirm that preva-
lence estimates obtained from clinic-
based data sources do not accurately
reflect the true prevalence of chla-
mydial infection among young adults.
For example, in 2001, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
used clinic-based test reports to esti-
mate incidence rates for chlamydial in-
fection of 604.9 per 100000 person-
years for men and 2447.0 per 100000
person-years for women aged 20 to 24
years.1 Converting the incidence rates of
the CDC to prevalence and assuming a
mean duration of infection of 6 months
to1.5years,27 theexpectedgeneralpopu-
lation prevalence of chlamydial infec-
tion would be between 0.3% and 0.9%
in men and 1.2% and 3.6% in women.
We found that the prevalence of chla-
mydial infection among young US men
and women is much higher. The Add
Health estimates also provide a realis-
tic counterpoint to clinic-based studies
that may overstate the prevalence of
chlamydial infection, such as those con-
ductedinclinicsinwhichrelativelyhigh-
risk persons present for sexually trans-
mitted disease or family planning
services.
The high national prevalence of chla-
mydial infection suggests that current
screening strategies have failed to con-
trol this easily curable sexually transmit-
ted infection in young adult men and
women.Onepossibleexplanationisthat
current recommendations for screen-
ing may be inadequate. For example,
young adult men who are asymptom-
atic account for a large reservoir of in-
fection in the general population but
screeningrecommendationshavelargely
excluded men.8 Although screening for
adolescent boys was included as a rec-
ommendation in the 1998 CDC guide-
lines,9 this recommendation was omit-
ted in the more recent 2002 guidelines.8
Even if sexually experienced adoles-
cents and young adults are observed in
clinic settings and meet criteria for
screening based on current recommen-
dations, they may not be screened. The
recommendations by the CDC regard-
ing screening of adolescent girls are not
widely observed.29-32 Moreover, al-
thoughmostpubliclyfundedclinicspro-
vide chlamydial screening for women,
manycannotscreenallwomenwhomeet
CDC guidelines due to budgetary con-
straints.33 Screening in private practice
settings is even less common.29,30 Our
findings clearly support the importance
of widespread implementation of cur-
rent guidelines, including screening or
treatingpersonswithgonorrheaforchla-
mydial infection.
The lack of connection between
young adults and health care systems
may also contribute to the failure of the
screening recommendations for chla-
mydial infection. Young adults are
much less likely to have health insur-
ance than any other age group and
many do not have a regular physician
or receive routine health care.34,35 Young
adults are often unaware of routine
screening recommendations for chla-
mydial infection and do not know that
infection may be asymptomatic.36,37 All
of these factors are likely to lead to fewer
opportunities to screen young adults for
chlamydial infection in clinic settings.
Our study, like all studies assessing
the prevalence of sexually transmitted
infections, is limited by the adequacy of
the study sample and the characteris-
tics of the diagnostic test used. The ad-
equacy of our study sample depends on
the representativeness of the original
school-basedsample,nonresponsetothe
follow-up survey for Wave III, and re-
fusal or other problems that led to a
missing specimen among participants in
Wave III. Although the original sample
included only students on school reg-
isters, assessment of the impact of ex-
clusion of adolescent school dropouts

has suggested that this bias in Add
Healthisminimal.38 Although24%ofthe
participants in Wave I could not be lo-
cated for Wave III, this element of non-
response has been accounted for in the
poststratificationadjustmentofthesam-
pling weights for Wave III. Finally, our
sensitivity analyses suggested that our
conclusions were robust to differences
incharacteristicsofnonrespondentsand
test performance.
In conclusion, we found the preva-
lence of untreated asymptomatic chla-
mydial infection to be high in young
adults in the United States. The high
prevalence of chlamydial infection in
both men and women suggests that cur-
rent screening approaches that focus
primarily on clinic-based testing of
young women are inadequate. The re-
duction of disparities in the preva-
lence of both chlamydial and gonococ-
calinfectionsacrossracial/ethnicgroups
must also be a priority.
