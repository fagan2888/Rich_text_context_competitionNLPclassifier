Abstract
Objective: To determine the correlates of serum lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) in children and
adolescents in the United States.
Methods: Cross-sectional study using representative data from a US national sample for persons
aged 4­19 years participating in The Third National Health Nutrition and Examination Survey
(NHANES-III).
Results: We observed ethnicity-related differences in levels of Lp(a) > 30 mg/dl, with values being
markedly higher in African American (black) than nonhispanic white (white) and Mexican American
children in multivariate model (P < 0.001). Higher levels of Lp(a) > 30 mg/dl associated with parental
history of body mass index and residence in metro compared to nonmetro in Blacks, and high birth
weight in Mexican American children in the NHANES-III. In the entire group, total cholesterol
(which included Lp(a)) and parental history of premature heart attack/angina before age 50 (P <
0.02) showed consistent, independent, positive association with Lp(a). In subgroup analysis, this
association was only evident in white (P = 0.04) and black (P = 0.05) children. However, no such
collective consistent associations of Lp(a) were found with age, gender, or birth weight.
Conclusion: Ethnicity-related differences in mean Lp(a) exist among children and adolescents in
the United States and parental history of premature heart attack/angina significantly associated with
levels of Lp(a) in children. Further research on the associations of Lp(a) levels in childhood with
subsequent risk of atherosclerosis is needed.

Introduction
Levels of serum or plasma Lp(a) above 30 mg/dL are asso-
ciated with increased risk of coronary artery disease and
stroke in adults of European descent [1-3]. Given the high
degree of structural homology of one of the domains of its
apolipoprotein(a) component with plasminogen, one
proposed mechanism is interference with thrombolysis
[1,3]. Adults of African descent have mean levels of Lp(a)
approximately twice those of Europeans but do not have
commensurately increased risk of atherosclerotic disease;
nor has Lp(a) been shown to be a coronary artery disease
risk factor in Blacks [4,5]. The explanations for the differ-
ential effects of Lp(a) on CVD risk among different popu-
lations are poorly understood. Because birth weight has
been shown to influence levels of Lp(a) [6], and adverse
patterns of blood lipids and atherosclerosis itself begin in
childhood, studies of population and individual differ-
ences in the early onset and progression of risk factors
through adolescence are important [7]. Given the
reported contribution of intrinsic factors, family history,
and environmental factors to the CVD risk in adults [8-
10], the identification of inherited risk markers and envi-
ronmental variables that may interact with levels of Lp(a)
> 30 mg/dl to modify its influence on the development of
atherosclerosis at an early age, is therefore imperative.
Few studies have examined the epidemiology of Lp(a) in
representative samples of total populations of children
and adolescents[11,12]. However, no study has examined
whether the effects of inherited and acquired or environ-
mental factors interact with Lp(a) > 30 mg/dl, to cause dif-
ferential attributable risk in different populations using
data from a nationally representative sample of children
in the US. We utilized data from a national survey of over
30,000 persons age 1 year and older with extensive blood
lipid data to examine correlates of Lp(a) in children and
adolescents and specifically to determine whether: [1] eth-
nic differences in shape of Lp(a) distributions seen in
adults are also seen as early as age 4 in children; [2] family
history of cardiovascular disease is associated with higher
levels of Lp(a); [3] the effects of ethnicity and family his-
tory of CVD on the levels of Lp(a) are influenced by low
birth weight, other personal, behavioral or environmental
variables.
Methods
Data for this analysis was obtained from The Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES-III) conducted on a nationwide multi-stage
probability sample of about 40,000 persons from the
civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 2 months
and over of the United States excluding reservation lands
of American Indians. Of these, 31,311 were examined.
Our analysis was restricted to children aged 4­11 years
(518 whites, 877 blacks, and 685 Mexican Americans)
and adolescents aged 4­19 years (336 Whites, 665 Blacks
and 504 Mexican Americans) with valid Lp(a) measure-
ments in Phase II of the survey conducted in 1991­1994.
Details of the planning, sampling, operation, informed
consent procedures, and measures taken to maintain con-
fidentiality of information have been previously detailed
[13].
Demographic, medical history and behavioral informa-
tion were collected prior to the examination by household
interview of the parents or guardians of children and of
adolescents aged 12 and over. Parents of children aged 2
months-11 years were asked "How much did the child
weigh at birth?". Parents responding "don't know" were
asked "Did the child weigh more than 5 1/2 pounds
(2500 grams) or less? Responders were then asked, "Did
the child weigh more than 9 pounds (4100 grams) or
less?" An approximate category of weight at birth was cre-
ated by combined responses to exact birth weights and the
latter two questions. Participants' parent or guardian was
also asked, "Has either of the biological parents ever been
told by a doctor that he or she had a) high blood pressure
or stroke before age 50 b) heart attack or angina before the
age of 50? c) high blood cholesterol at any age? d) diabe-
tes at any age? All "Yes" responses were followed by
"Which, father, mother, or both?" Other interview varia-
bles are described elsewhere [13].
Blood samples were obtained at the examination centers
[14]. A subsample of persons 12 years and over was asked
to fast overnight for the examination of lipids in the
morning. Lp(a) in serum was measured immunochemi-
cally by using an enzyme-lined immunosorbant assay
(ELISA) (Strategic Diagnostics, Newark, DE) [14], which
does not have cross reactivity with plasminogen or LDL
non sensitive to apo(a) size heterogeneity. The normal
range was set at 0 to 30 mg/dL because concentrations
above 30 mg/dL have been associated with increase risk
for coronary heart disease and stroke [1,3] (Plasma con-
centrations were 3 % lower than serum concentrations).
The quality control of the Lp(a) assay has been described
in detail elsewhere [14]. Serum samples with Lp(a) > 80
mg/dL were diluted into the assay range with sample
diluent.
Serum total cholesterol were determined at the Centers for
Disease Control using a modified ferric chloride tech-
nique (GFAA/Perkin-Elmer Model 3030 and 5100) [14].
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) was measured in serum
following the precipitation of other lipoproteins with a
polyanion/divalent cation mixture and triglycerides were
measured enzymatically by Hitachi 704 Analyzer autoan-
alyzer (Boehringer-Mannheim Diagnostics). LDL choles-
terol level was calculated by the Friedewald equation for
individuals 12 years and older who were examined in the

morning and fasted 9 hours or more, and whose triglycer-
ide concentration was less than or equal to 400 mg/dL.
Because fasting was not required in children, LDL could
be calculated on only 15% of this sample. In selected anal-
yses, serum total cholesterol was corrected for Lp(a) cho-
lesterol as follows: TCc = TC - Lp(a) × 0.30 [11]. Standing
height was measured to the nearest 0.1 centimeter, weight
to the nearest 0.01 kg, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and
mid-thigh skinfold thickness to the nearest 0.1 millimeter
and waist and buttocks circumference to the nearest 0.1
centimeter [15,16].
Statistical analysis
Population estimates for many of the variables other than
Lp(a) have been published by the National Center for
Health Statistics [14,17]. Because, body weight, family
history, socio-economic factors including income, gender,
ethnicity, birth weight and regional diversity have been
shown to influence levels of Lp(a) and or CVD risk in gen-
eral, [18-20,6,21] our analyses of the population estimate
and correlates of Lp(a) were mindful of these factors. In
order to ensure adequate weight for a given age group, and
to examine pre- peri- and post pubertal effects on levels of
Lp(a), quintile distribution of age was used as a categori-
cal variable. Detailed descriptive statistics and measures of
association were computed initially using unweighted
data. Kendall's nonparametric rank correlation was used
to assess the association of Lp(a) with other variables and
compared to Pearson correlation [22]. To determine the
influence of gender and ethnicity on the distribution of
Lp(a), analysis of covariance was used to compute
adjusted means for subjects within sex and ethnic catego-
ries, and to assess the statistical significance of differences
of means among groups. Stepwise logistic multiple regres-
sion analysis was used to develop models for predicting
Lp(a) >30 mg/dL for each sex, and ethnic group [22].
Only variables with pre-specified hypotheses and with sta-
tistically significant univariate correlation coefficients
were eligible to enter the regression models. Following
these preliminary analyses, preplanned hypotheses and
major findings of the unweighted analyses were con-
firmed using techniques that incorporated sampling
weights and design features of the survey [14]. Population
estimates for mean Lp(a) and percentiles and statistical
tests of weighted proportions were produced using Statis-
tical Analysis System (SAS) callable SUDAAN [23]. Chi-
Square analysis was used for the comparisons of distribu-
tions of Lp(a) categorized into 10 mg/dL strata between
sex, ethnicity and age groups. Associations of Lp(a) with
other variables were confirmed in final weighted analysis,
using PROC LOGIST procedure in SUDAAN [23] with
alpha set at <0.05. Since substantial proportions of white
and Mexican American children had undetectable Lp(a),
log or other transformations could not produce an
approximately normal distribution of Lp(a) for paramet-
ric analyses. Therefore analytic results presented are pri-
marily those using Lp(a) > 30 mg/dL as a categorized
variable.

Ethnicity
Blacks had higher median Lp(a) than whites, who had
higher levels than Mexican Americans (Table 1). The dif-
ference was already apparent at ages 4­5 years. Further,
the shape of the Lp(a) distributions differed markedly for
BLACKS compared to other ethnic groups at each age and
overall. Blacks had a bimodal distribution that was less
skewed than whites or Mexican Americans (Figure 1). The
percentage of children aged 4­19 with Lp(a) > 30 mg/dL,
was higher in Blacks (54.3, SE 1.8) than in Whites (20.3,

SE 2.4) or Mexican Americans (16.8, SE 2.3), both overall
(Chi square 47.4, p < 0.001) and in each age group (Table
1).
Age
Table 3 shows percentiles by sex, age and ethnic group.
Among boys of all sex-ethnicity groups, median Lp(a) was
higher at age 6­11 than at age 4­5, then tended to decline
slightly through age 16­19. Among girls, there was no
consistent pattern for median Lp(a), being highest at age
16­19 in whites, at age 12­15 in blacks, and at 6­11 in
Mexican Americans. The percentage with Lp(a) > 30 mg/
dL varied significantly by age group only in Mexican
Americans (Chi square = 10.6, P = 0.02) (Table 1).
Gender
Median Lp(a) did not differ consistently by gender across
age or ethnic groups (Table 3). Similarly, the percentage
with Lp(a) > 30 mg/dL did not differ significantly by gen-
der within ethnic groups (Chi Square = 0.003, P = 0.96).
Birth Weight
Birth weight by parental recall was available for children
aged 4­11 years (Table 4). Birth weight did not vary with
Lp(a) in any ethnic group. Further, in blacks, the percent-
age with Lp(a) >30 mg/dL did not differ by birth weight
category (52.5, 53.3, 56.4, respectively). Small numbers of
cases with both abnormal birth weight and elevated Lp(a)
>30 mg/dL among whites and Mexican Americans pre-
cluded meaningful analysis.
Family history
In all the groups combined (age range 4­16 years), the
percentage with Lp(a) > 30 mg/dL was significantly higher
among those with parental history of heart attack/angina
before age 50 years compared to those without (50.0 per-

whereas the percentage (Lp(a) > 30 mg/dL) was similar
among those with parental history of diabetes and high

numbers of children with a history of heart attack within
ethnic groups, the difference in percentage of persons with
Lp(a) did not attain significance in within-groups

black children 72.37% versus 54.06%, P = 0.12, Mexican
American children 34.46% versus 18.26%, P = 0.33 (Table
2). In white children, the percentage was higher in
children with a parent with high blood cholesterol com-
pared to children without (26.74% versus 16.12%; P =
0.02). However, no significant differences were seen in
other groups.
Region
Among white children, median Lp(a) was lower in the
Midwest (8.2 mg/dL) and South (8.2) than in the
Northeast (16.4), or West (10.1). No differences were
noted for Blacks and too few Mexican Americans lived in
the Northeast and Midwest for evaluation. In white chil-
dren, the percentage with Lp(a) > 30 mg/dL were 15.1 in
the Midwest, Northeast 25.1, South 21.2, West 21.4 (P =
0.56). Among blacks, a greater percent of metropolitan,
compared to non-metropolitan (57% Vs 49.7%; P = 0.04)
had Lp(a) > 30 mg/dL. No significant differences were
seen in other groups.
Income
Family income < $20,000 was not associated with Lp(a) >
30 mg/dL in whites or Mexicans, but Blacks with low
income tended to have a higher percentage of individuals
with Lp(a) >30 mg/dL (56.9% versus 50.5%, P = 0.10).
Poverty income ratio was not significantly correlated with
Lp(a).
Multivariate Analyses
The following additional variables known to influence
CVD risk were assessed as correlates of Lp(a) by ethnic
group: age, total serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, cas-
ual triglycerides, hours of fasting, weight, height, body
mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, sub-
scapular skinfold thickness, suprailiac skinfold thickness,
pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heavy
activity frequency or TV hours. Logistic regression analysis
with Lp(a) > 30 as dichotomous dependent variable and
age in months as independent variable revealed a signifi-
cant linear association in whites (beta = 0.004, SE = 0.002,
P = 0.03) and a quadratic association in Mexican Ameri-
cans (age beta 0.068, SE = 0.013, P < 0.001, age squared
beta -0.000, SE beta 0.000, P < 0.001), indicating a lower
prevalence of Lp(a) > 30 mg/dL at both ages 4­5 and 16­
19 than at 6­15 years. Age and age squared, and sex were
entered first in all analyses described below. Controlling
for age, sex was not significantly associated with high
Lp(a) in any group. Compared to whites, non-hispanic
black ethnicity was significantly associated with high
Lp(a) after controlling for age and sex (P < 0.001). Mexi-
can American ethnicity was not significantly associated
with lower prevalence of high Lp(a) (P = 0.35). Within
ethnic groups at ages 4­11 years, low birth weight (<2500
g) was not significantly associated with high Lp(a) after
controlling for age and sex. High birth weight (>4100 g)
was associated with high Lp(a) (beta 1.87, P = 0.02) only
in Mexican Americans.
Parental history of heart attack/angina before age 50 was
significantly associated with Lp(a) >30 after controlling
for age and sex both in white children (beta -1.14, SE 0.55,
P = 0.04) and in blacks (beta -0.80, SE 0.39, P = 0.05).
Parental history of heart attack/angina was also signifi-
cantly associated with high Lp(a) in all children (P = 0.02)
after controlling for age, sex and ethnicity. In white chil-
dren, parental history of high blood cholesterol (P = 0.07)
and diabetes mellitus (P = 0.16) were not significantly
associated with high Lp(a) after adjustment for age and
sex.
Residence in central cities/fringe areas remained signifi-
cantly associated with high Lp(a) in black children after
controlling for age, sex, region, season, and time of the
day (beta = -0.33, SE = 0.13, P = 0.02). Region, rural/
urban code, family income < 20,000 or higher poverty
income ratio were not significantly associated with high
Lp(a) in white or Mexican American children (all P >
0.05).
Body mass index or weight were significant predictors of
Lp(a) > 30 mg/dL only among black children after con-
trolling for age, sex, region, rural/urban code, season and
poverty income ratio, e.g. weight(kg) P = 0.02. Neither
HDL cholesterol nor casual triglyceride concentration was
significantly associated with Lp(a) after controlling for
multiple variables. Total serum cholesterol was signifi-
cantly associated with Lp(a) after controlling for multiple
variables in all three ethnic groups as expected.
Discussion
The most important findings of this study are that ethnic-
ity significantly associated with Lp(a), and that parental
history of heart attack significantly associated with Lp(a)
levels >= 30 mg/dl. While non-hispanic black children
had significantly higher total Lp(a) level, compared to
white and Mexican American children, no consistent asso-
ciations of age or gender with Lp(a) were found in
NHANES-III below age 20. Low birth weight (<2500 g)
was not significantly associated with high Lp(a) after con-
trolling for age and sex in the entire group. Higher levels
of Lp(a) >30 mg/dl was evident in metropolitan com-
pared to non-metropolitan non-hispanic black children.
Mechanisms
Lp(a) is a circulating particle that consists of phospholip-
ids, cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B-100 (i.e. a LDL par-
ticle), with apolipoprotein(a) attached to the latter at a
single point [5,24]. Like LDL, Lp(a) when oxidized may
promote atherosclerosis by promoting formation of foam
Lipids in Health and Disease 2004, 3:29 http://www.lipidworld.com/content/3/1/29

cells which release growth factors. Lp(a) acquires a patho-
genic profile on entering the arterial cell wall as a result of
the influence of factors operating in the inflammatory
environment of the atheromatous vessel, such as proteo-
lytic enzymes of the metalloproteinase family [25]. About
80% of the amino acids in apo(a) are homologous with
those of plasminogen, suggesting a possibly thrombolytic
effect which might both promote atherosclerosis and trig-
ger acute thrombotic occlusions [1,3,26].
Whereas levels of Lp(a) above 30 mg/dL was shown to
increase risk of coronary heart disease in European sam-
ples [3,24], no such association has been found in black
populations, in whom the concentration is twice that in
Europeans [24,27]. Study of serum concentrations of this
particle in children is especially important since, unlike
LDL, its concentration is postulated to be remarkably sta-
ble throughout the life of an individual. Thus, identifica-
tion of persons at increased risk early in life would permit
more effective intervention to lower levels of modifiable
risk factors such as LDL cholesterol.
Environment, Ethnicity, Age and Gender
A number of studies of adults have compared Lp(a) levels
in Whites and Blacks, and have uniformly reported two-
fold higher levels in Blacks [4,5,11]. In Texas, Mexican
American adults were found to have lower Lp(a) than
whites. Conversely, Kambor et al observed higher mean
and median plasma Lp(a) concentrations in hispanic men
than white men in Colorado with lesser difference seen in
women[28]. Although the explanations for these findings
remain unclear, environmental factors, genetic admixture
[29] or a combination of both should be considered.
No previous reports of studies comparing Lp(a) in whites
and blacks and Mexican American children in the same
study were found prior to NHANES-III. In fact, few com-
parisons of plasma Lp(a) concentrations were found for
hispanic children or other children below age 8 years prior
to NHANES-III [30,31]. The present findings extend the
published report by examining children in greater detail
and examining the relationship of birth weight and family
history of cardiovascular disease with Lp(a) in children.
Perhaps one of the most noteworthy observation from
this study is the significantly higher levels of Lp(a) >30
mg/dl in black, compared to white and Mexican American
children (Table 1). Ethnic-related differences in Lp(a)
similar to those in adults were found in children as young
as 4­5 years of age, supporting the presence of higher lev-
els of Lp(a) in black children compared to other ethnic
groups (Table 1). This observation is consistent with find-
ings of the Bogalusa Heart Study of white and black chil-
dren, and the NHLBI Growth and Health Study of girls
that showed higher Lp(a) levels in black than white chil-
dren [30,32]. Findings in Mexican Americans in the
NHANES-III study is analogous to reports from the Colo-
rado study showing a greater percent of Hispanics than
whites (19% versus 12%) to have Lp(a) > 25 mg/dL.
The explanation for ethnic-related differences in levels of
Lp(a) in the US remains unclear. Other than total choles-
terol, no single environmental or biological variable con-
sistently associated with levels of Lp(a) in the NHANES-III
sample. While levels of Lp(a) > 30 mg/dl received signifi-
cant contributions from BMI and residence in metro com-
pared to non-metro in black children, only higher birth
weight significantly contributed to levels of Lp(a) in Mex-
ican American children. Contrary to a previous report of
association of low birth weight with elevated Lp(a) con-
centration in black children, [6] we found no consistent
association of low birth weight with levels of Lp(a) in
black or white children in the present study (Table 4).
At the genetic level, heritability estimates were reportedly
higher for Whites than for Blacks [33,34] despite the dis-
proportionately higher levels of Lp(a) in Blacks. This
observation raises an important question about the
genetic determinants of differential levels of Lp(a) in non-
hispanic Blacks compared to Whites. A recent study on
genetic linkage analysis by Barkley et al found no linkage
evidence to support the presence of a single but separate
gene with large effects specifically segregating in non-his-
panic Blacks that may account for elevated Lp(a) lev-
els[35] Conversely, high levels of Lp(a) levels have been
suggested to be an old African trait that is associated with
mutations in the coding sequences of apo(a) [36]. Collec-
tively, these disagreements among studies suggest that
higher levels of Lp(a) in non-hispanic Blacks compared to
other ethnic groups, may result from a complex interac-
tion of genes with environmental and metabolic factors,
[37]. Future identification of the presence and nature of
this interaction is imperative.
Studies of adults found an association of higher age and
female gender with higher Lp(a) levels [38]. The Bogalusa
Heart Study found a small but significant gender differ-
ence and a weak positive correlation with age (p < 0.001)
in white girls 11­17 years of age [30]. However, we found
no consistent associations of age or gender with Lp(a) in
NHANES-III below age 20 (Table 3). Despite the levels of
Lp(a) that tended to be highest between age 6 ­ 11 years
in boys, the lack of similar trend in girls, and the absence
of age-related difference in the levels of Lp(a) in the com-
bined group, suggests that pre-pubertal or pubertal status
may not significantly influence levels of Lp(a) in children.
Altogether, our observation from the present NHANES-III
study, together with the work of others [30,38] found very
few significant associations of Lp(a) with personal, behav-
Lipids in Health and Disease 2004, 3:29 http://www.lipidworld.com/content/3/1/29

ioral, or environmental variables. It therefore appears
likely, that multiple factors at the environment and or
genetic levels may act together to differentially influence
levels of Lp(a) in children and adolescents in the US.
Family History
Few studies of the association of Lp(a) with family history
have been reported in children [30,39]. Our observations
of significant association of parental history of heart
attack/angina before age 50, with levels of Lp(a) >30 mg/
dl in NHANES-III (Figure 2) are consistent with results
from the Bogalusa study that found an association of
parental history of premature heart attack with higher lev-
els of Lp(a) [30]. However, contrary to Bogalusa study
showing an association of Lp(a) with parental history of
hypercholesterolemia, trends for family history in black
children in NHANES-III were concordant with those in
whites, although not attaining statistical significance.
More recently, Dirisamer and colleagues provided addi-
tional support for higher levels of Lp(a) levels in children
and adolescents from families with premature coronary
heart disease compared to those without familial coro-
nary heart disease [40]. In young adults aged 23­35 years
in the CARDIA study, a non-significant trend toward
higher Lp(a) levels in those with a family history of myo-
cardial infarction was observed in whites, but no associa-
tion was seen in blacks [33]. Collectively, the association
of parental history of premature heart attack appears asso-
ciated with levels of Lp(a) > 30 mg/dl, may lend support
to the theory of genetic underpinning for the higher levels
of Lp(a) observed in black children.
In the NHANES-III study, no association of Lp(a) were
seen with family history of stroke, hypertension, or
diabetes. Similarly, family history of high cholesterol and
diabetes were not significantly associated with levels of
Lp(a) >30 mg/dl in the entire sample (Figure 2), except in
non-hispanic white children (Table 2). Cross-sectional
studies of adults have not consistently shown a relation-
ship of Lp(a) with NIDDM. Conversely, several reports
indicate an association between IDDM with Lp(a)
[29,41]. However, NIDDM is thought to have a stronger
genetic component in its etiology than IDDM [42].
Despite the inconsistencies in the literature, there is strong
evidence to suggest that Lp(a) is a risk factor for vascular
disease in diabetics [43]. Further research on clinical and
subclinical diabetes and Lp(a) is needed.
Limitations
Limitations of the present study include possible bias
from survey non-response, missing values for some varia-
bles, and confounding by variables not measured. Fortu-
nately, several special studies of earlier NHANES-III data
have indicated little bias due to non-response [44].
Although, adequate reliability has been demonstrated for
Lp(a) measurement [14], the lack of a single, generally
accepted laboratory method and national standardization
program remains a problem, perhaps explaining in part
the inconsistencies among studies [3]. The relatively large
sample size provided good statistical power and the con-
servative criteria for statistical significance reduced the
possibility of chance findings attaining significance
despite a large number of tests. Overall, the representa-
tiveness of the sample and the use of sample weights pro-
vided wide generalizability of the results to United States
black and white and Mexican American children and ado-
lescents of the same ages.
In conclusion, ethnicity significantly associated with lev-
els of Lp(a). Parental history of heart attack/angina before
age 50 years associated with levels of Lp(a) > 30 mg/dl in
offspring. Collectively, different pathological thresholds
may have to be established for elevated serum Lp(a) lev-
els, to be used as a risk marker for coronary heart disease
in different populations. Future research should include
longitudinal studies of Lp(a) in white, black and hispanic
children followed to adulthood. Racial admixture as well
as environment and behavioral variables associated with
acculturation and urban residence should be studied,
especially in Mexican American and black populations.
Standardization of methods will facilitate inter-study and
longitudinal comparisons.
