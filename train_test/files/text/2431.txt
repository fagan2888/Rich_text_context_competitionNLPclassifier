Abstract
We examine the moderating role of friendship and school network characteristics in
relationships between 1) youths' friends smoking behavior and youths' own
generalized expectancies regarding risk and future orientation and 2) generalized
expectancies of youths' friends and youths' own generalized expectancies. We
then relate these constructs to smoking. Using a longitudinal sample from the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N515,142), the relationship
between friends' generalized expectancies and youths' expectancies is stronger for
those more central in the network, with more reachability, or stronger network ties,
and weaker for those with denser friendship networks. Risk expectancies exhibited
an inverted U shaped relationship with smoking at the next time point, whereas
future orientation expectancies displayed a nonlinear accelerating negative
relationship. There was also a feedback effect in which smoking behavior led to
higher risk expectancies and lower future orientation expectancies in instrumental
variable analyses.
Introduction
Numerous studies have examined the relationship between social network
characteristics and various health and risk behaviors across populations [1­3]. A
voluminous and growing body of literature has yielded keen insights into
pathways linking adolescent social networks and risk behaviors including
smoking; notably studies utilizing Stochastic Actor-Based Models [4, 5] have
elucidated linkages between degree based, triadic, and other network effects and
both friendship tie choice and adolescent smoking, for example [6­9]. Other

studies yet have taken alternative approaches to gaining insight into pathways
linking adolescent friendship networks and smoking behavior, finding that
emotional support linked network characteristics and adolescent smoking
behavior [10]. While such studies have yielded valuable insights, more theoretical
work is necessary to further delineate the complex linkages between adolescent
networks and smoking behavior, particularly research explicitly linking adolescent
network characteristics with cognitive processes which might impact adolescent
smoking.
As such, the present study considers whether adolescents' cognitive expectan-
cies, in part developed within their peer networks, have consequences for
subsequent smoking behavior. Expectancies are learned expectations that some
reinforcement or grouping of reinforcements will occur in any given situation or
across situations [11]. Foundational theories of health behavior emphasize
expectancy constructs in learning, attitude formation, and engagement in health
behavior [12, 13]. Social Cognitive Theory [13] posits that the social environment,
cognition, and behavior, are in constant interaction as humans learn to adapt to
their environments via numerous processes including the formation of
expectations and social influences. For adolescents, peers are important role
models, and are sources of information, validation, and social influence, all of
which affect youths' decision making about risk behaviors such as smoking. The
positive relationship between peer influence and adolescent smoking is well
documented [14, 15]. Studies conceptualize peer influence in relation to
adolescent smoking in various ways, including the number of friends youth have
who smoke [16].
Premised upon intuition from Social Cognitive Theory, this study considers
that youths' social networks might play a moderating role in shaping adolescents'
expectancies through learned associations made via social interactions with peers
and through the structure of these networks. Thus, youths' expectancies may be
affected by those held by their friends given the propensity towards similarity
among friends on multiple dimensions during adolescence [17, 18]. Youths'
expectancies are likely a product of the expectancies of one's network members
along with the network structure. We posit a conceptual model (see Fig. 1) and
employ an accompanying two-stage modeling strategy which implies that
expectancies are key constructs along pathways through which adolescent network
characteristics impact smoking. We examine whether characteristics of adoles-
cents' personal networks of friends and the larger school wide network shape
youths' own expectancies, and also test whether youths' own expectancies relate to
their smoking behavior. Specifically, our model delineates the following direct and
moderated pathways linking characteristics of adolescent networks, youths' own
expectancies, the expectancies held by youths' friends, their friends' smoking
behavior, and youths' own smoking behavior. The direct relationships under
study relate: 1) characteristics of adolescents' networks and both friends'
expectancies and friends' smoking behavior to adolescents' own expectancies; 2)
characteristics of adolescents' networks, friends' smoking behavior, and their
friends' expectancies to youths' own smoking behavior, and 3) youth's own
preparation of the manuscript.

expectancies to their smoking behavior. Moderated pathways examine whether
adolescent network characteristics moderate the relationship between both
friends' expectancies and friends' smoking behavior and youths' own expectan-
cies. Another pathway examines whether one type of expectancy under study, risk
perception, has a nonlinear relationship with adolescent smoking. In what follows,
we describe the rationale for the expectancies, network characteristics and
pathways under study. We are not aware of studies conceptualizing both direct
and moderated pathways linking adolescent networks, their own expectancies,
their friends' expectancies and friends' smoking behavior, with their own smoking
behavior.
Generalized Expectancies
The role of expectancies in adolescent drug use is well documented [19­21].
Studies have found that smoking related expectancies­specific beliefs regarding
the potential consequences of smoking-are associated with adolescent smoking
[22]. Past research also finds a strong relationship between general health related
expectancies and adolescent smoking [23]. While expectancies have been defined
in various ways, the generalized expectancy is of interest in this study. Such
expectancies arise from a specific set of circumstances and generalize to a sequence
of situations which are perceived as similar, which then forms a generalized
expectancy for this grouping of related events or behaviors [24]. Theories of
adolescent risk behavior incorporate generalized expectancies, notably Problem-
Behavior Theory [25] as adolescents' perceived chances of future life events
occurring. Past studies have examined the relationship between adolescents'
perceived life chances and adolescent risk behaviors [26­31].

While research has demonstrated the importance of generalized expectancies
for adolescent problem behaviors, a recent review of the adolescent decision-
making literature [32] emphasized the need for research which contextualizes
decision-making processes within youths' social contexts. We follow this call by
studying how youths' networks relate to their generalized expectancies. We focus
on two generalized expectancy constructs salient to adolescent smoking: 1) risk
perceptions and 2) future time perspective.
Risk perceptions are subjective judgments about uncertain events and other
potential hazards, and come into play in foundational theoretical perspectives
describing health behavior [12, 33]. During adolescence, youth make decisions
regarding risk; this involves processing subjective probability judgments about
uncertain events occurring in their lives [34].
Interestingly, studies indicate a lack of clarity regarding the nature and
direction of the relationship between risk perception and adolescent smoking.
Rational choice models would predict a negative relationship between risk
perception and adolescent risk behavior. Indeed, some studies find such a
relationship regarding smoking [35]. Likewise, longitudinal studies indicate that
adolescents perceiving lower risks of deleterious health consequences from
smoking are more likely to begin smoking [36]. However, some research indicates
that adolescents who perceive more risks engage in more risk behavior [37­39].
One possibility for these mixed findings is that a reciprocal relationship between
risk perception and smoking exists; as Gerrard et al. [39] found a reciprocal
relationship between perceptions of vulnerability and adolescent risk behavior
including smoking. Another possibility is that the relationship between risk
perceptions and smoking is non-linear, as there may be a threshold point beyond
which high levels of risk perception actually reduce smoking behavior. Gerrard
et al. [39] suggest that individuals who engage in a risk behavior and do not
experience negative consequences from doing so may continue the behavior based
on the ``absent/exempt'' perspective of Weinstein [40]. Moreover, these
researchers indicate that the relationship between perceptions of vulnerability and
risk behavior is initially linear, at some point plateaus and then eventually
decreases, and that an inverted-U shaped relationship between perceived
vulnerability and risk behavior might be found in studies which utilize adolescent
samples spanning the adolescent age range, thus capturing the trajectory of
engagement in risk behavior. Given the lack of clarity regarding how risk
perception relates to adolescent smoking, our study examines this as a non-linear
relationship by testing the quadratic effect of risk perception.
The second type of generalized expectancy under study is having a temporal
orientation towards the future, which is based on evidence that humans perceive
time in past, present, and future reference frames [41]. Whether adolescents
engage in risk behavior is related to their temporal orientations towards their
futures [42]. Present time perspective, an orientation towards present events, is
positively related to adolescent smoking and other substance use [43]. Future time
perspective is an orientation towards future events [44]. Adolescents employing a
future time perspective are likely able to conceptualize long term goals and are
Adolescent Networks, Expectancies and Smoking

aware of the long term consequences of their actions. One study found that
adolescents with a future time perspective (i.e., those who perceived higher
chances of attending college or higher expectations of living to age 35) smoked
fewer cigarettes in young adulthood [30]. In another study, adolescents reporting
lower chances of living to age 35 were more likely to smoke or use illicit
substances, and had higher suicidal ideation and attempt [31].
Adolescent Network Characteristics
Following the insights of Social Control Theory [45], we posit that adolescents
who are socially integrated in their schools will express different generalized
expectancies and will be less likely to smoke compared to their less integrated
counterparts. Youth who are less tightly bound within the social structure of the
school may be more likely to smoke. Indeed, studies generally find that less
socially integrated youth (e.g., isolates and those who act as liaisons or bridges
between otherwise disconnected groups) are more likely to smoke [46­48],
although one study of young adolescents in sixteen predominantly Hispanic/
Latino Southern California middle schools found that popularity positively relates
to susceptibility to smoking [49]. We expect that our general population sample,
which spans the adolescent age range, will exhibit results consistent with the
general pattern of studies in this area.
We therefore examine whether network characteristics capturing social
integration in youths' networks are related to youths' generalized expectancies,
which might then relate to smoking behavior. We are particularly interested in
how certain network characteristics might moderate the relationship between
friends' expectancies or friends' smoking behavior and youths' own expectancies.
We measure social integration in networks using: (1) degree centrality [50] which
reflects prestige in a network, (2) reachability or ``reach'', which is the number of
youth an adolescent may know via direct and indirect ties in the network [51] (3)
the density or extent to which adolescents' friends know one another within their
personal network, and (4) the strength of adolescents' ties to those in their
friendship networks. We also examine a network characteristic indicating less
social integration in school based networks: the number of nominated friends
outside the school. Next, we draw on the adolescent social network and smoking
literature to provide theoretical intuition for why these network characteristics are
important for the generalized expectancies under study and smoking.
Linking Friendship Network Characteristics, Generalized
Expectancies & Smoking
Popular youth are directly connected to many others in their network and tend to
set and reflect normative trends with respect to smoking in their setting [49].
These youth are therefore in a structural position to be strongly exposed to peer
influences condoned by the mainstream in their setting. Consequently, the
generalized expectancies regarding risk and future orientation of popular youth
Adolescent Networks, Expectancies and Smoking

and their smoking behavior are likely to align with those held by the popular
mainstream, be they risk protective or risk promotive for smoking. Therefore, it is
likely that the generalized expectancies of popular youth will more closely mirror
the expectancies of their friends than will be the case for less popular youth.
Another salient network characteristic for the generalized expectancies under
study and smoking behavior is reachability or ``reach.'' Reach has implications for
diffusion in a network [52], including the transmission of peer influences and
information [53]. Youth with high reach are likely exposed to diverse
informational inputs and a broad range of peer influences given their high level of
integration. Thus, reach may affect youth's generalized expectancies towards risk
and future orientation given that youth with high reach may learn from social
interactions with diverse network members which generalize across situations.
This raises the question of whether youth with high levels of reach are more likely
to adopt their friends' generalized expectancies, who may hold a varied set of
generalized expectancies. In contrast, socially isolated adolescents with a lower
reach will have fewer opportunities for exposure to diverse informational inputs,
which may circumscribe learning in their environment which will in turn affect
their generalized expectancies and smoking.
The density of personal network ties may impact adolescents' exposure to
friends' generalized expectancies and smoking behavior. Densely connected
network ties are thought to increase regulatory social influences exerted in a
network (Laumann, 1973; Krohn, 1986). Thus, dense network ties may align
youths' expectancies and smoking behavior with predominate expectancies and
smoking behavior in the network. In one study, Haynie [54] found that network
density moderated the delinquency-peer association, with dense networks
containing stronger delinquency-peer associations than those that are less dense.
Other research indicated that adolescents with denser networks had lower odds of
recent smoking [48].
Also important for adolescents' generalized expectancies and smoking is the
strength of their network ties. Granovetter conceptualized tie strength as the sum
of the time investment, emotional intensity, intimacy, and services exchanged
within a social tie [55]. These strong and sometimes longstanding ties may be
conduits of influence in adolescent friendships, and as such youth may hold
similar generalized expectancies and smoking behaviors. Indeed, research shows
that close friends display homogeneous smoking behavior [56].
Adolescents' friendship ties outside school may capture inputs from a
potentially important set of friends regarding both generalized expectancies and
smoking. It is unclear what kind of impact these friends have on youths'
generalized expectancies and smoking, however, interacting with these youth
likely provides diverse opportunities for learning that may differ from those youth
are exposed to with school friends. Having friends outside of school has been
positively associated with adolescent smoking [48]. In addition, in schools in
which students nominate numerous friends outside of school, the school and
network boundary cannot be equated, perhaps lessening the prominence of any
characteristic within the school [57].
Adolescent Networks, Expectancies and Smoking

School networks comprise all students in a school and the relationships among
them. We are not aware of any studies examining how characteristics of school
networks relate to youths' generalized expectancies. We examine three school level
network characteristics which are likely salient to generalized expectancies and
smoking. First, we consider size, or the number of adolescents in a school and a
geographically proximal ``sister'' junior or senior high school. Larger schools allow
for more heterogeneous expectancies and smoking behavior. In larger school
networks, there is a higher probability of individuals holding diverse expectancies
and engaging in a diversity of behaviors due to a larger number of people,
providing a potentially broader range of influences and informational inputs to
which these individuals are likely exposed. Second, we examine the density of ties
or extent to which adolescents know one another in their schools. School level
density captures the possible regulatory influence of the school network structure
on the generalized expectancies and smoking, with denser networks exerting more
pressure to conform to predominant peer influences in the school environment.
Third, clustering of youth within their networks is the extent to which youth are
highly and mutually connected in sub-areas of a network. Clustering may act to
intensify and confine peer influences and informational inputs within densely
connected regions of a network, which typically are areas of high homogeneity on
beliefs and behaviors maintained by strong peer influences. Those within clusters
may hold similar generalized expectancies and smoking behavior given their
similar exposure to peer influences and other informational inputs.
Current Study
The current study examines direct and moderated pathways linking adolescent's
personal and school network characteristics, their own generalized expectancies
towards risk and future orientation, their friends' expectancies and smoking
behavior, and their own smoking in a large and nationally representative sample.
Given the large and heterogeneous sample under study, we expect that personal
network measures indicating social integration will negatively relate to smoking,
while measures indicating less integration will positively relate to smoking. We
expect that the network characteristics will moderate the relationships between
both friends' smoking behavior and expectancies and youths' own generalized
expectancies. We also expect that the network characteristics reflecting social
integration will be positively related to future orientation expectancy, and that
having ties outside of school will be negatively related to future orientation
expectancy. We expect that risk expectancy will be nonlinearly related to smoking
and future orientation expectancy will be negatively related to smoking. We
hypothesize that friends' smoking will be positively related to adolescent smoking.

Methods
Participants
Data come from the In-School and first In-Home waves of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [58]. The In-School survey was
administered to students in a nationally representative sample of schools in grades
7 through 12 from September 1994 through April 1995. The first In-Home survey
was administered to a random sample of these students approximately six months
later. After eliminating the 5,239 students who did not answer the question about
smoking behavior at wave 2 or were not identified to a school in wave 1, the study
sample was 15,142 students attending 133 schools. This study approved by the
University of California, Irvine Institutional Review Board. Add Health
participants provided written informed consent for participation in all aspects of
Add Health in accordance with the University of North Carolina School of Public
Health Institutional Review Board guidelines that are based on the Code of
Federal Regulations on the Protection of Human Subjects 45CFR46: http://www.
hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html. Written informed consent
was given by participants (or next of kin/caregiver) for their answers to be used in
this study.
Measures
There are three dependent variables. Smoking behavior at wave 2 was measured as
the number of cigarettes smoked in the last month. We also included as a
covariate smoking behavior at wave 1, based on an ordinally scaled question
asking respondents how often they smoked cigarettes in the last year (05never;
15once or twice; 25once a month or less; 352 or 3 days a month; 45once or
twice a week; 553 to 5 days a week; 65nearly every day).
Generalized Expectancies
We created two generalized expectancy scales at time 1 as dependent variables: 1)
future orientation expectancy and 2) risk expectancy. We specified a two factor
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model and computed factor scores from this
model. The model fit was excellent for this CFA: although the chi square was
significant (x2558.8 on 3 df at wave 1), this is largely due to the large sample size.
Whereas root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) values less than .05
are considered satisfactory, our value of .036 suggests excellent fit. Likewise,
whereas values for the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) or the Tucker-Lewis index
greater than .9 or .95 are considered satisfactory, our values of .99 again suggest
excellent fit.
The generalized expectancy indicators comprising the scales asked respondents:
``What do you think are the chances that each of the following things will happen
to you?''(15no chance, 25some chance, 35about 50­50, 45pretty likely, 55it
will happen). The measure of risk expectancy used the following questions: 1) you
will be killed by age 21; 2) you will live to age 35; and 3) you will get HIV or AIDS.
Adolescent Networks, Expectancies and Smoking

This measure represents a perceived susceptibility dimension of risk relating to
disease and mortality, see [59]. Perceived susceptibility constructs have played a
key role over the last few decades in foundational theories of health behavior such
as the Health Belief Model [33, 60]. The measure of future orientation expectancy
combined three questions: 1) you will be married by age 25; 2) you will graduate
from college; and 3) you will live to age 35. This construct taps into youths'
cognitive time frame and whether it is oriented towards the future.
To assess construct (i.e., both convergent and divergent) validity of the
generalized expectancies, we correlated the both with other measures, including:
1) danger due to a dare in the last 6 months was correlated .25 with risk and 2.23
with future orientation expectancies; try do to school work well was correlated 2.21
and .23, respectively; and a measure of getting drunk in the last 12 months was
correlated .25 and 2.27, respectively. These correlations are in the expected
direction with future orientation expectancy. In ancillary regression analyses, we
found an increasing nonlinear relationship between risk expectancies and these
three measures, consistent with studies indicating a positive relationship between
risk perceptions and engagement in risk behavior. We also assessed whether risk
expectancies simply captured perceived risk due to living in a dangerous
neighborhood: the correlation was effectively zero with the poverty rate,
unemployment rate, or median income of the neighborhood, and the county violent
crime rate. The correlation between future orientation expectancies and the
percentage with at least a bachelor's degree in the neighborhood was only .07,
suggesting that this measure does not simply capture perceptions of neighbor-
hood context.
Social Network Measures
A network elicitation item asked respondents to nominate up to 5 male and 5
female friends, these are respondents' alters. Respondents could name persons in
their school, at a geographically proximal ``sister'' junior high school, and friends
outside school. Personal networks are local friendship network subsets of larger
school networks. School networks comprised all students in a school and
relationships among them.
Bonacich Centrality reflects the centrality or prestige of an individual in a
network, and is weighted by the centrality of his or her friends; we set b to a small
positive value (.1) to reflect positive prestige and to more heavily weight the local
structure of the network [50]. Reach is the number of persons an adolescent can
reach directly or indirectly in the network. Personal network density computes the
number of ties in a personal network divided by the number of possible ties. This
proportion is undefined in networks with one or no ties and is given missing
values; therefore as a methodological solution, we include an indicator for near-
isolates (51 if one or no ties). Average tie strength was created by constructing the
strength of each tie named by an adolescent based on a sum of whether the
adolescent reported engaging (yes/no) in the following activities with an alter in
the last seven days: a) went to their house; b) met after school to hang out; c)

spent time last weekend; d) talked on the telephone, and then computed the sum
over all alters in the personal network. Lastly, ties outside of school measured the
number of youth respondents named as friends who were not in their schools. All
measures were created using Jim Moody's SPAN program [61].
At the school network level, school size captures the number of youth in a
school. School network density is the number of relationship ties in the school
divided by the total possible ties that could exist. The clustering coefficient
measures the average density in the personal networks within a school.
We constructed measures of friends' smoking behavior and friends'
expectancies. We measure friends' smoking behavior as the average smoking
behavior of youth's friends in their personal networks, which is consistent with
measures in past studies [16]. We also examine the average expectancy score for
one's friends for both risk and future orientation, respectively.
We included demographic measures that relate to smoking and generalized
expectancies. Gender was coded as female, (05male, 15female). Grade level is
coded continuously, ranging from 7 to 12. Race/ethnicity was coded as four
dummy variables (Black, Asian, Latino, and Other Race, where White was the
reference category). A dummy variable indicates whether the adolescent is an
immigrant. We computed parental support as the mean of two questions regarding
support from mother or father: ``How much do you think she [he] cares about
you?'' (on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ``not at all'' to ``very much''), and
mother's education (15less than eighth grade; 25more than eighth grade but not
high school graduate; 35high school graduate; 45some college; 55graduated
from college; 65beyond 4 year degree).
We also account for the school composition. The average level of youths'
mother's education in the school captures school socio-economic status. Racial/
ethnic composition is measured by percentage of Blacks, Asians, and Latinos. We
constructed measures of average smoking behavior, average risk expectancies, and
average future orientation expectancies at the first time point.
We accounted for the modest amount of missing data with a multiple
imputation strategy. The largest level of missing data was for mother's education
at 14%; however, on average the variables had just 2.7% missing values. We
randomly imputed 50 datasets using the ICE command in Stata, which uses
switching regression, an iterative multivariable regression technique. The results
were combined using Rubin's technique to correct the standard errors [62]. This
requires the less stringent assumption of missing at random, rather than the
stronger assumption of missing completely at random required of listwise deletion
[62].
Analysis strategy
Given the nesting of students in schools, we estimated multilevel linear models for
three separate outcomes: the factor score of risk expectancies, the factor score of
future orientation expectancies, and the smoking measure. Thus, we estimate the
following level one equation:

for each expectancy at time one, to allow for possible nonlinear relationships. In
unconditional models, 21% of the variance in wave 2 smoking is between schools;
likewise 18% and 12% of the variance in future orientation and risk expectancy is
between schools, respectively.
We use temporality to account for possible feedback effects in the smoking
equation: the outcome is measured at time 2 whereas the covariates are measured
at time 1. For the two generalized expectancies equations, we accounted for
possible feedback effects of the personal smoking covariate with instrumental
variable estimation. We include two instrumental variables: parents' smoking
behavior; presence of cigarettes in the home noted by the interviewer. This
predicted value of smoking from the first stage equation is then included in the
expectancies equations. The Basmann and Sargan tests showed nonsignificant
results, indicating that these instruments are uncorrelated with the error term.
The first stage R2 of .20 is satisfactory, and the F-test value of 119.7 indicates that
these are strong instruments [63].
We tested for moderation in the expectancies equations by creating interactions
between friends' risk expectancies, or future orientation expectancies, or smoking
behavior, and the four network characteristics (Bonacich centrality, reach,
personal network density, and average tie strength). There was no evidence of
collinearity in these models, as variance inflation factors were all below 4. To
further assess potential collinearity in the network measures we estimated ancillary
models including one network measure at a time, and the results were effectively
the same as those in the presented models.
Results
In our sample, 51% were female, 24% were Black, 21% were Latino, 10% were
Asian, and 6% were other race. Ten percent were immigrants. Adolescents had 1.5

smoke, 10% smoked one cigarette a day, about 2­3% fell into each of the

future orientation expectancies and adolescent's own future orientation
expectancies (b5.095, p,.01), holding all else constant in this model. In equation
2 we observe a similar positive relationship between the average risk expectancies
of one's friends and oneself (b5.041, p,.01). There is no evidence that friends'
smoking behavior relates to one's own expectancies when accounting for the
measures in the model. However, those who smoke more have lower future
orientation expectancies (b52.118, p,.01) and higher risk expectancies
(b5.032, p,.01), implying a possible reciprocal relationship between smoking
and expectancies that we will return to in the equations with the smoking
outcome.
Among the network measures, adolescents with stronger personal network ties
hold higher risk expectancies on average (b5.005, p,.05). Adolescents with
greater reach in their networks have higher future orientation expectancies
(b5.088, p,.01) and lower risk expectancies (b52.042, p,.01). More central
adolescents hold higher future orientation expectancies (b5.081, p,.01).
Adolescents in larger schools hold higher risk expectancies, on average (b5.037,
p,.01).
Among the demographic measures, females have higher future orientation
expectancies and lower risk expectancies. Blacks and Latinos have lower future
orientation expectancies compared to Whites (the reference category), whereas
Latinos, Asians and other race adolescents have higher risk expectancies.
Immigrants and those with highly educated mothers have higher future
orientation expectancies, whereas those with more parental support hold higher
future orientation expectancies and lower risk expectancies.
Moderating role of the network for generalized expectancies as
outcome measure
We next examine the possible moderating role of the network characteristics in
the relationship between friends' generalized expectancies or smoking behavior
and adolescents' own future orientation and risk expectancies; these results are
shown in Table 3. In model 1 we find strong evidence based on the interaction
term that the strength of ties in one's personal network enhances the strength of
the relationship between the future orientation expectancies of an adolescent's
friends and their own expectancies (b5.016, p,.05). We plot these results in
Fig. 2. The upward sloping lines indicate that higher levels of friends' future
orientation expectancies are associated with higher levels of future orientation
expectancies by adolescents. In addition, although there are few differences in
future orientation expectancies among adolescents whose friends have low levels
of future orientation expectancies (the left side of Fig. 2), those whose friends
have high levels of future orientation expectancies have higher levels themselves
and particularly so when their personal network has high average tie strength (the
right side of Fig. 2).
In contrast, in model 2 personal network density diminishes the relationship
between friends' future orientation expectancies and one's own expectancies

(b52.154, p,.05). Thus, the densest personal networks weaken the relationship
between the expectancies of one's friends and oneself.
We find positive interaction effects between friends' future orientation
expectancies and those in central positions in the network (b5.068, p,.05; model
3) and those with high levels of reach (b5.049, p,.05; model 4). When we plot
the interaction effect for centrality (not shown) it is very similar to Fig. 2 for the
tie strength interaction. For the interaction between reach and friends' future
orientation expectancies, we find that those with higher reach have higher future
orientation expectancies and that the relationship between friends' expectancies

and one's own expectancies is strongest for those with high levels of reach (not
shown).
Turning to the models with risk expectancies as the outcome, the interaction
effect for average tie strength is not statistically significant. We see that denser
personal networks weaken the relationship between the risk expectancies of one's
friends and oneself (b52.111, p,.05). Plotting this interaction (not shown)
revealed a relationship similar to that seen in Fig. 2 except that the top line in the
graph is low density networks. We again find positive interaction effects for those
who are more central (b5.064, p,.01), or with greater reach (b5.038, p,.05),
(models 7 and 8). Plotting the result for the centrality interaction in Fig. 3
demonstrates that those with the highest centrality levels have lower risk
expectancies when their friends have low risk expectancies (the left side of this
figure) and matching high expectancies with their friends (the right side of the
figure). Thus, their risk expectancies tend to be more similar with their friends'
risk expectancies. Finally, the interaction for reach indicates that whereas those
with higher levels of reach have lower risk expectancies, this gap narrows when
their friends have high risk expectancies (not shown).
We also estimated models in which we included interactions between the
network measures and friends' smoking behavior. In none of the models was the
interaction statistically significant. Thus, whereas friends' generalized expectancies
are associated with an individual's own expectancies through the network
structure, friends' smoking behaviors do not similarly impact an individual's
generalized expectancies.
Smoking behavior at time 2 as outcome measure
Turning to the models with smoking behavior at time 2 as the outcome, models 3
and 4 in Table 2 include respondents' future orientation and risk expectancies
respectively at time 1 as covariates. There are strong stasis effects, as smoking
behavior at time 1 is positively associated with smoking behavior at time 2 in
model 3 (b5.574, p,.01). There is also strong evidence that those with higher
average smoking among their friends at time 1 engaged in more smoking behavior
at time 2, even controlling for their level of smoking at time 1 (b5.162, p,.01;
b5.164, p,.01). Nonetheless, respondents with higher levels of future orientation
expectancies are much less likely to smoke at time 2 even controlling for prior
smoking behavior (model 3): this is an accelerating nonlinear negative relation-
ship as plotted in Fig. 4 (plotted from the 5th to 95th percentile of future
orientation expectancies). Whereas the lower range of future orientation
expectancies only have a modest negative relationship with smoking at time 2 (the
left side of the figure), high levels have a sharp negative association with smoking
(the right side of the figure). Thus, combining the results of models 1 and 3
implies a virtuous feedback cycle between future orientation expectancies and
smoking: whereas model 1 in Table 2 found that lower levels of smoking at time 1
lead to higher future orientation expectancies (b52.118), model 3 shows that
Adolescent Networks, Expectancies and Smoking
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0115668 December 23, 2014 18 / 27
higher future orientation expectancies result in reduced smoking at time 2
(Fig. 4).
Turning to model 4, when plotting the quadratic relationship between risk
expectancies at time 1 and smoking at time 2 Fig. 5 reveals a pronounced
inverted-U relationship. Whereas increasing risk expectancies for those at the low
end of the scale sharply increases smoking behavior at time 2 (the left side of the
figure), increasing risk expectancies actually have a negative relationship with
smoking at time 2 at the high end of the scale (the right side of the figure). There
is no evidence that friends' expectancies have an additional effect on smoking
behavior at time 2.
Although the network measures were important for adolescents' generalized
expectancies, which then related to future smoking, there was little evidence that
the network measures have direct effects on smoking (models 3 and 4 in Table 2).
Only the measure of having more ties outside the school showed a direct positive
relationship with smoking at time 2 (b5.013, p,.05; b5.014, p,.05).
Finally, the demographic measures relate to time 2 smoking, as expected. Blacks
and Latinos smoke less than Whites at time 2, whereas those in a higher grade and
immigrants smoke more. Although higher levels of mother's education are
associated with less smoking at time 2, parental support has an opposite

relationship. There are school contextual effects: adolescents in schools with
higher average future orientation expectancies and lower average risk expectancies
at time 1 will smoke more at time 2. Notably, these unexpected results become
non-significant if the school measures are excluded from the model, suggesting
that these school-level expectancy results are only obtained when controlling for
the school composition.
Discussion
Our findings provide evidence that whereas generalized expectancies are related to
smoking at the next time point, these expectancies are a product of the generalized
expectancies of one's network members along with the network structure. Our
two-stage modeling strategy implies that expectancies are key constructs along
pathways through which network measures relate to smoking. Adolescents more
central in the network, or more well integrated based on reach, reported higher
levels of future orientation expectancies, and these future orientation expectancies
led to less smoking at the following time point. Those with less reach and stronger
ties report greater risk expectancies; these risk expectancies showed a pronounced
nonlinear relationship with future smoking as increases at the lower end of the
Fig. 4. Effect of future orientation expectancy on smoking at next time point.

scale were associated with more future smoking, but this relationship actually
turned negative at the highest levels of risk expectancy. Overall, findings suggest
that expectancies play a complex role in the relationship between characteristics of
adolescents' personal networks and their smoking behavior.
A novel contribution of this study was focusing on the relationship between
adolescent networks and generalized expectancies, and the possible consequences
for smoking. For instance, our interaction models indicate that those who are
more central in the network are more likely to hold generalized expectancies in
concert with those of their friends. Thus, highly central adolescents with friends
who hold higher future orientation expectancies hold higher future orientation
expectancies themselves. Likewise, highly central adolescents will tend to mirror
their friends' level of risk expectancies (see Fig. 4). A highly central adolescent
with friends who are high in future orientation expectancies will therefore tend to
have higher future orientation expectancies, and these higher future orientation
expectancies are associated with less smoking over time.
Having high levels of reach also had implications for the two types of
generalized expectancies studied here. For adolescents with high levels of reach,
their own generalized expectancies are more likely to mirror those of their friends.
Thus, those with high levels of reach and friends with high future orientation

expectancies have higher future orientation expectancies, which are associated
with less smoking at time 2. Reach likely captures the potential for information
flow in the network, and our findings that individuals with greater reach may be
more influenced by expectancies of both types is consistent with the idea that
youth with a far reach are exposed to diverse informational inputs given that they
have the potential for many and diverse friendships. This finding highlights some
of the many functions network ties serve, including possibly as conduits for
information and influence. The transmission of peer expectancies through
networks may be particularly important for fostering adolescents' expectancies.
It was also the case that those with stronger ties to their friends were more likely
to hold higher future orientation expectancies if their friends held high future
orientation expectancies, as shown in Fig. 2. These higher future orientation
expectancies have an accelerating negative relationship with future smoking (even
controlling for the level of smoking at the prior time point), suggesting that these
strong ties play an important role in this relationship. The same pattern was not
detected among those whose friends hold low levels of future orientation
expectancies, nor was it detected in relation to the risk expectancies of friends.
Whereas the presence of strong ties in a personal network increase the similarity
between the generalized expectancies of an adolescent and his or her friends,
density operated differently. We instead detected a negative interaction effect,
such that in personal networks with low levels of density and friends with higher
levels of generalized expectancies, an adolescent will tend to report higher levels of
generalized expectancies compared to those with personal networks with higher
density. This pattern was found for both types of generalized expectancies. We
had hypothesized that higher density would in fact have a positive moderating
effect rather than this negative one. This one unexpected finding suggests a useful
avenue for future research to explore why this might be the case.
Another key contribution of this study was in detecting a strong and reinforcing
reciprocal relationship between future orientation expectancies and smoking.
Prior research has not parsed apart these effects. On the one hand, adolescents
with higher future orientation expectancies smoked less at the next time point,
and this relationship was pronounced for those with very high levels of future
orientation expectancies. On the other hand, we also detected a feedback effect in
an instrumental variable analysis that accounted for these interdependent
relationships: adolescents who smoked less expressed higher future orientation
expectancies.
The reciprocal relationship detected between smoking and risk expectancies was
more nuanced. Although smoking behavior linearly increased risk expectancies in
an instrumental variable analysis, there was an inverted-U relationship between
risk expectancies and smoking at the next time point. The positive relationship
between risk expectancies and smoking for those in the lower range of risk
expectancies becomes negative at the highest levels of risk expectancies. This
change in the direction of the relationship may imply a threshold beyond which
risk expectancies become threatening and the behavior less frequent. Gerrard and
colleagues (1996) suggested a possible inverted-U relationship between percep-

tions of vulnerability and risk behavior in samples spanning the adolescent age
range, given that risk behaviors are just developing earlier in adolescence and
perceptions of vulnerability will therefore not increase indefinitely but instead
level off and begin to decelerate, impacting the behavior. Perhaps the age range
and heterogeneity of our sample aided in the detection of this relationship.
This study has some limitations of note. The networks were limited to up to 5
female and 5 male friends, which may not account for all of the youths' closest
friends. It is unclear how truncating the networks in this way may have affected
the findings. Relatedly, we did not have full information about those outside
school whom adolescents nominated. Third, it is unclear how students who were
eliminated from the study sample because they did not answer the question about
smoking behavior affected our study findings. Fourth, this study is limited by the
secondary data source, which is most relevant for measuring the generalized
expectancies and the parental variables under study.
Despite these limitations, our findings have notable implications for future
research. First, our findings indicate a need for further examination of how
adolescent network characteristics relate to these expectancies. Findings also
suggest testing other specifications of nonlinear relationships between the
expectancies and smoking, across various age ranges of adolescent samples.
Moreover, findings suggest merit in the general theoretical strategy of testing the
role of expectancies in the context of adolescent network characteristics for
smoking. Findings also suggest that reciprocal relationships between expectancies
and smoking should be studied in other adolescent populations. Future research is
necessary to study the role of generalized expectancies in linking adolescent social
networks to smoking behavior, to disentangle the nuanced linkages between
adolescents' friendship networks, generalized expectancies, and smoking. Our
novel theoretical approach is a first step toward such future research.
Our findings also have practical implications for intervention programs
targeting adolescents' cognitions and smoking behavior. Our findings suggest
targeting youth who are central in their networks or who have greater reach, to
reinforce future orientation expectancies among youth in their personal network,
which we find then related to less smoking. Our findings also suggest
understanding when youth experience shifts in their risk expectancies and
correspondingly when their smoking behavior starts to decelerate, to help youth
make those shifts which correspond to decreasing smoking behavior earlier in
time.
Conclusions
In sum, our findings provide evidence that adolescents' generalized expectancies
regarding risk and future orientation act as key variables along theoretically
nuanced pathways linking youths' network characteristics and smoking, along
with friends' expectancies and smoking behavior in youths' networks. Findings
suggest that these networks and friends' expectancies alike played a nuanced and

multiplicative role in shaping youths' generalized expectancies. As such, future
theoretical work is necessary to more fully delineate the complex and synergistic
cognitive linkages between adolescent youths' social networks and smoking
behavior.
