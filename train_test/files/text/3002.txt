Background: The impact of diet on blood pressure and
the age-related changes in blood pressure have been dif-
ficult to detect within one population. We designed this
analysis to study the association of major dietary factors
with blood pressure and with age-related changes in blood
pressure in a representative sample of the US population.
Methods: Data were obtained on all individuals 20 years
or older (n=17030) surveyed in the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), includ-
ing demographic data, anthropometric data, dietary in-
take (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, protein,
alcohol, and total energy) based on 24-hour recall, and
blood pressure. Multivariate models relating diet to blood
pressure were constructed using stepwise regression, best
subset regression, and multiple regression.
Results: Systolic blood pressure was positively associ-
ated with higher sodium, alcohol, and protein intakes
(P.05) and negatively associated with potassium in-
take (P=.003). Diastolic blood pressure was negatively
associated with potassium and alcohol intakes (P.001).
Pulse pressure was positively associated with sodium, pro-
tein, and alcohol intakes (P.001). A higher intake of
calcium (P=.01) was associated with a lower rate of rise
in systolic blood pressure with age.
Conclusion: A diet low in sodium, alcohol, and protein
is associated with lower systolic blood and pulse pres-
sure. Potassium intake was associated with lower systolic
and diastolic blood pressure, whereas alcohol intake
was associated with lower diastolic blood pressure. In ad-
dition, the age-related changes in systolic blood pressure
were attenuated by higher calcium and protein intakes.
Magnesium was not associated with any changes in blood
pressure.

RESULTS OF the recently re-
ported Dietary Approaches
to Stop Hypertension
(DASH) trial document the
effects of overall dietary
patterns on blood pressure levels.1 Al-
though many specific dietary factors have
been linked with changes in blood pres-
sure, relatively strong evidence exists for
only a few of them. Higher blood pres-
sure levels have been associated with high
intakes of alcohol, sodium, and protein and
low intakes of potassium, calcium, and
magnesium.2-11 The effects of these nutri-
ents on blood pressure are more appar-
ent in studies among several popula-
tions, as it is difficult to consistently detect
the impact of specific dietary factors on
blood pressure or age-related changes in
blood pressure within one population. For
example, although a relationship be-
tween sodium consumption and blood
pressure has been demonstrated in across-
population studies, at the time this ar-
ticle was written, this was not the case in
within-population studies. An analysis of
the first National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES I) data con-
cluded that a high sodium intake was as-
sociated with lower blood pressure.4 The
difficulty of accurately measuring nutri-
ent intakes and their limited range within
a single population contribute to the dif-
ficulty of assessing the relationship be-
tween specific dietary factors and blood
pressure within a population11,12
Moreover, few studies have in-
cluded methodological approaches to ad-
just for the effect of the high correlation
andinteractionamongdifferentdietary fac-
tors.13 These studies have usually as-
sessed the association of isolated dietary
factors with blood pressure rather than as-
sessing multiple factors taken together.14
We designed this analysis of NHANES III
to study the associations between the
major dietary factors and systolic (SBP)
and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and
pulse pressure (PP), as well as age-related
changes in blood pressure.

RESULTS
The overall sample that satisfied our selection criteria (age
20 years) included 17030 participants. The mean±SD
age of the overall sample was 48.8±0.2 years; the popu-
lation was 47% male. The ethnic breakdown was 42%
white, 28% African American, 26% Hispanic, and 4%
other. The mean±SD BMI (calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by the square of height in meters) of the
sample was 27.1±0.2. The dietary intake of sodium in
the overall sample was high, whereas the daily potas-
sium, calcium, and magnesium intakes were low in re-
lation to the recommended dietary guidelines.24,25 Afri-
can Americans consumed more sodium than the other
ethnic groups, but less potassium, calcium, and magne-
sium (P.001 for each dietary factor). Consumption of
all dietary factors was higher in men than in women
(P.001) (Table 1).
There was a linear association between age and SBP
and a curvilinear association between age and both DBP
and PP (P.001 for all 3 associations) (Figure 1). In
the univariate analysis, after adjustments for age, sex, eth-
nicity, and BMI, SBP was positively associated with the
sodium-potassium ratio (P.001), alcohol consump-
tion (P.001), and total energy consumption (P=.007)
and negatively associated with potassium intake (P.001).
Systolic blood pressure was not associated with the so-
dium, magnesium, calcium, or protein intake. Diastolic
blood pressure was negatively associated with calcium
intake (P.001) and positively associated with alcohol
consumption (P.001). No other associations were de-
tected, including total energy consumption. Pulse pres-
sure was negatively associated with magnesium intake
(P.001) and positively associated with alcohol con-
sumption (P.001); no other associations were found.
When the standardized daily intake per kilocalorie
was used to measure the dietary factors, different asso-
ciations were found. Lower SBP and DBP were associ-
ated with higher daily intakes of calcium, magnesium,
and potassium per kilocalorie, whereas higher SBP and
DBP were associated with a higher intake of alcohol per
kilocalorie (P.001 for each association) (Table 2).
In the multivariate analysis, higher SBP was asso-
ciated with a higher daily intake of sodium, protein, and
alcohol (P=.048 for sodium; P.001 for protein and al-
cohol) (Table 2). The associations of alcohol and pro-
tein intake with SBP were less prominent in women than
in men (P=.048; VIF, 1.5, for men; P.001, VIF, 9.6, for
women). Calcium potentiated the effect of protein on SBP
(P=.03; VIF, 9.4), while potassium blunted that effect
(P.001; VIF, 9.4) (Table 3). Lower SBP was associ-
ated with a higher potassium intake (P=.003). Systolic
blood pressure was not associated with any other di-
etary factors. In the final multivariate model for DBP, lower
DBP was only associated with the higher consumption
of potassium and alcohol (P.001 for both). In the final
multivariate model for PP, higher PP was associated with
higher sodium, protein, and alcohol intake (P<.001 for
all 3) but not potassium, magnesium, or calcium intake
(Table 2). The association between alcohol and PP was
lower in women (P<.001; VIF, 1.6) (Table 3). Calcium
intake was associated with an attenuated rate of rise in
METHODS
The NHANES III is a stratified multistage probabil-
ity sample of the US population. The sampling meth-
ods and the survey protocols have been previously
described.15 Dietary information was obtained via a
24-hour recall questionnaire, and standardized blood
pressure and anthropometric measurements were
taken by a trained observer. Of the 39695 partici-
pants in NHANES III, our analysis included only those
participants 20 years of age or older (n=17030).
Our data set included demographic informa-
tion (age, sex, and ethnicity), anthropometric infor-
mation (weight, height, and body mass index [BMI],
as reported in the survey), and blood pressure (the
mean of 3 readings of SBP and DBP). We selected di-
etary factors commonly thought to be associated with
blood pressure, including sodium, potassium, cal-
cium, magnesium, protein, alcohol, and total en-
ergy consumed per day. We excluded the other mac-
ronutrients (fat and carbohydrates) because they
lacked evidence suggesting an association. Pulse pres-
sure was calculated by subtracting the DBP from the
SBP for each participant.
Intakes of the different dietary factors evaluated
were highly correlated with each other. A conse-
quence of this intercorrelation (or multicollinearity)
among dietary factors was the inability to attribute an
independenteffectofanysinglenutrientonbloodpres-
sure.16,17 Standardization of individual dietary factors
using density measures (either as an energy ratio ob-
tained by dividing the amount consumed by total en-
ergy per day or a mass ratio obtained by dividing the
amount consumed by the BMI of each participant) de-
creased this degree of intercorrelation. We elected to
use the density measure for our statistical analysis.
Univariate and multivariate analyses relating con-
sumption of dietary factors to blood pressure were
performed. For the univariate analysis, weighted lin-
ear and polynomial regression models were used.18
Adjustments were made for demographic variables
and BMI. To develop the multivariate model, a ran-
dom subsample (n=8529) was selected from the to-
tal sample and used to choose the best set of vari-
ables to be included in the final models. These
variables included the demographic variables, BMI,
dietary factors using density measures, and dietary
factor interaction variables. Standard stepwise re-
gression18-20 and best subset regression19,21 models were
used to select these variables. A principal compo-
nent analysis was also performed.16,17 These meth-
ods minimize the effect of intercorrelation on the
model developed.17 The model was then tested on the
remainder subsample (n=8501) using a multiple-
weighted regression model.18 The variable inflation
factor (VIF) was also calculated for each variable to
measure the effect of intercorrelation in the final
model.22,23 A VIF of 10 or less indicates a low degree
of intercorrelation and, hence, more reliable re-
sults.17 The final model developed was applied to the
overall sample (n=17030). Minitab Release 12.22 soft-
ware (Minitab Inc, State College, Pa) was used for
statistical analysis.

SBP with age. The mean (SD) rate of increase of SBP with
age was 0.65 (0.01) mm Hg per year for the lower tertile
of calcium consumption, 0.58 (0.01) mm Hg for the
middle tertile, and 0.53 (0.02) mm Hg for the upper ter-
tile (P=.02; VIF, 4.4) (Figure 2).
Overall, the final models explained 40.9% of the SBP
variability, 16.7% of the DBP variability, and 40.9% of
the PP variability in the sample. Age alone contributed
about 35.3% and diet about 2% of the SBP variability.
About 6% of the DBP variability was explained by age
and 3% by diet, whereas about 39% of the PP variability
was explained by age and 2% by diet.
COMMENT
The statistical approach of this analysis, specifically, the
multistep multivariate analysis and the standardization to
the individual's total energy intake, led to more valid re-
sults than those previously reported, and the models in
this analysis were more stable. Consistent with previous
results in other populations,13 we found a high degree of
multicollinearity among the different dietary factors evalu-
ated in NHANES III. Our approach was able to detect and
correct for this prevalent but unnoticed phenomenon of
multicollinearity. By including multiple factors together,
evaluating their interactions, and adjusting for their high
degree of interdependence, we were able to develop mod-
els that allowed us to detect specific associations between
dietary factors and blood pressure in addition to identi-
fying patterns of dietary associations with blood pres-
sure. In particular, we were able to study the impact of diet
on age-related changes in blood pressure by including age
and diet interaction measures in our models.
Our analysis of NHANES III documents that higher
sodium, protein, and alcohol intakes are associated with
higher SBP and PP. These associations with sodium and
protein intake were apparent only in the multivariate
model, whereas the associations of alcohol intake with
SBP and PP were observed in both the univariate and mul-
tivariate models. Our finding of an association between
sodium intake and SBP is in accordance with animal mod-
els, across-population surveys, and intervention tri-
als.6,10,26-29 Earlier studies provided conflicting results about
the association between protein intake and SBP,30-32 while
our analysis demonstrates a positive association. This as-
sociation is blunted by a higher potassium intake and mag-
nified by a higher calcium intake. Our analysis also adds
evidence for a positive association between alcohol in-
take and SBP,6,8,17,19,33-35 although the converse was true
in the univariate analysis, highlighting the importance
of adjusting for covariates. The associations of higher PP
and lower DBP with higher alcohol intake have not been
described previously. Furthermore, our analysis sug-
gests that the associations between alcohol intake and SBP

and PP are more prominent in men than in women. Simi-
larly, the Belgian Interuniversity study showed that al-
cohol consumption is associated with higher SBP only
in men.36 In accordance with prior evidence,4,7,37-40 we ob-
served that higher potassium consumption was associ-
ated with lower SBP and DBP. Our study shows the im-
portance of potassium intake for blood pressure levels
in the population.
Until the present study, no relationship between di-
etary factors and PP has been reported. Recent evidence
suggeststhatPPismorepredictiveofcardiovascularevents,
especially coronary events, than either SBP or DBP or even
mean arterial pressure.41 The relationship of PP to cardio-
vascular events is present even in the absence of an el-
evated SBP, and the incidence of all these events is de-
creased by measures that reduce PP.41 Our observations
suggest that this risk factor may be favorably modified by
reducing dietary intakes of sodium, protein, and alcohol.
Our results suggest that the age-related changes in
blood pressure within the US population can be modi-
fied by dietary manipulations. Higher calcium and pro-
tein intakes attenuated the age-related rise in SBP, whereas
higher sodium, alcohol, and protein intakes increased the
rate of the age-related change in DBP. These observa-
tions remain to be confirmed using longitudinal data.
Consistent with previous studies,11,37 blood pres-
sure and dietary factors in our sample were associated

less strongly than blood pressure and demographic fac-
tors or BMI. Despite this smaller effect, the impact of diet
in the general population is significant, since smallchanges
in blood pressure in a large population would have a sig-
nificant effect. In addition, this magnitude of the effect
of specific nutrients on blood pressure within the gen-
eral population is not dissimilar from results of clinical
trials.2
In summary, this is one of the largest analyses to in-
vestigate the association of diet and blood pressure within
a population, especially within older age groups. The re-
sults have important clinical and public health implica-
tions. Since dietary habits are potentially modifiable, the
manipulation of diet could have a significant impact not
only on blood pressure levels but also on the rise in blood
pressure with age. More specifically, our results suggest
that a diet low in sodium, protein, and alcohol and rich
in potassium and calcium would affect the blood pres-
sure levels in the general population, including PP. Fur-
thermore, our study shows that, since the impact of an
individual nutrient on blood pressure is modified by the
intake of other nutrients, it is important to assess the over-
all diet rather than any single nutrient in isolation when
measuring the impact of diet on blood pressure.
