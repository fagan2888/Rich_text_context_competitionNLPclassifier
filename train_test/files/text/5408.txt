Background TNK-S2B, an innovative, randomized, seamless phase II/III trial of
tenecteplase versus rt-PA for acute ischemic stroke, terminated for slow enrollment
before regulatory approval of use of phase II patients in phase III.
Purpose (1) To review the trial design and comprehensive type I error rate
simulations and (2) to discuss issues raised during regulatory review, to facilitate
future approval of similar designs.
Methods In phase II, an early (24-h) outcome and adaptive sequential procedure
selected one of three tenecteplase doses for phase III comparison with rt-PA.
Decision rules comparing this dose to rt-PA would cause stopping for futility at
phase II end, or continuation to phase III. Phase III incorporated two co-primary
hypotheses, allowing for a treatment effect at either end of the trichotomized
Rankin scale. Assuming no early termination, four interim analyses and one final
analysis of 1908 patients provided an experiment-wise type I error rate of <0.05.
Results Over 1,000 distribution scenarios, each involving 40,000 replications, the
maximum type I error in phase III was 0.038. Inflation from the dose selection was
more than offset by the one-half continuity correction in the test statistics. Inflation
from repeated interim analyses was more than offset by the reduction from the
clinical stopping rules for futility at the first interim analysis.
Limitations Design complexity and evolving regulatory requirements lengthened
the review process.
Conclusions (1) The design was innovative and efficient. Per protocol, type I error
was well controlled for the co-primary phase III hypothesis tests, and experiment-
wise. (2a) Time must be allowed for communications with regulatory reviewers
from first design stages. (2b) Adequate type I error control must be demonstrated.
(2c) Greater clarity is needed on (i) whether this includes demonstration of type I
error control if the protocol is violated and (ii) whether simulations of type I error
control are acceptable. (2d) Regulatory agency concerns that protocols for futility
stopping may not be followed may be allayed by submitting interim analysis results
to them as these analyses occur. Clinical Trials 2011; 8: 398­407. http://

Introduction
The TNK-S2B trial [1] was an innovative, multi-
center, double blind, randomized, seamless phase
II/III study of intravenous tenecteplase (TNK) versus
standard-dose intravenous alteplase (rt-PA at 0.9
mg/kg) for treatment of patients with acute ische-
mic stroke within 3 h of onset. A key motivating
factor for development of tenecteplase was to
produce a molecular variant of rt-PA that would
reduce the risk of symptomatic intracranial hem-
orrhage (ICH) while retaining clinical efficacy. The
phase II component employed an adaptive sequen-
tial dose selection procedure to choose a preferred
dose of tenecteplase, using an early (24 h) assess-
ment of major neurological improvement (MNI)
balanced against occurrence of symptomatic ICH.
Once a preferred tenecteplase dose was estab-
lished, it was moved forward in the phase III
component to compare with standard-dose rt-PA.
Decision rules comparing the selected tenecte-
plase dose and rt-PA on safety and efficacy
outcomes were devised to yield a clear recom-
mendation to either stop the trial for futility at
the end of phase II, or continue into phase III.
The trial was prematurely terminated for slow
enrollment after 112 patients had been random-
ized at 8 clinical centers between 2006 and 2008.
At that point, the proposal to include patients
enrolled in the phase II portion of the trial in the
phase III analysis had not received regulatory
approval because of concerns regarding control of
the type I error rate.
Although the trial results were insufficient to
establish promise or futility [1], its novel adaptive
design, with substantial provision for the control of
type I error, is nevertheless of interest, given
current discussion of draft FDA guidelines on
adaptive designs [2]. This article has two goals.
The first is to review the key design features of the
trial, and the design and results of its comprehen-
sive type I error rate simulation studies. The second
is to discuss issues raised during the regulatory
review of the design, which focused on the type I
error simulations, and their implications for gain-
ing approval for use of this type of adaptive design
in the future.
The TNK-S2B Design
The TNK-S2B trial incorporated three main design
features: (1) a sequential selection procedure for
choosing one tenecteplase dose from among three
candidate doses (0.10, 0.25, and 0.40 mg/kg), by
the sequential elimination of inferior dose arms,
potentially leading to a dose selection decision at
an early stage of phase II; (2) at the end of phase
II, a preliminary comparison of the clinical efficacy
and safety endpoints from patients treated with the
selected dose of tenecteplase to those from
patients treated with rt-PA, to determine promise
or futility for continuing into phase III; and (3)
if the results were promising, continuation of
the study, with additional clinical sites, to com-
pare the selected dose of tenecteplase with
rt-PA in phase III, treating the decisions at the
end of phase II as the first interim analysis of
phase III. We provide details about each of these
features.
Sequential selection procedure for the best
dose of tenecteplase
The selection procedure was a truncated Levin-
Robbins sequential elimination procedure [3,4]
based on a rapid-response, ordered trichotomous
outcome determined within 24 h of randomiza-
tion. The best category was MNI, defined as a !8-
point improvement from baseline on the NIH
Stroke Scale [5] or a score of 0 at 24 h after stroke
onset. The worst category was symptomatic ICH
within 24 h of stroke onset. The intermediate
category was neither MNI nor ICH (NEI). Patients
were randomized in permuted blocks of size 4
matched by clinical site (quadruplets) to rt-PA or
one of the three doses of tenecteplase. Although
patients were also randomized concurrently to
rt-PA to preserve the blinding and to eliminate
other possible temporal biases, only the tenecte-
plase arms were involved in the selection proce-
dure. Once a rapid response was obtained from
each of the three patients assigned to the tenecte-
plase doses in a matched quadruplet, their data
were entered into an ongoing sequential cumulative
sum scoring system. This added the value 2 to the
cumulative sum for any dose arm for a rapid-
response outcome of MNI, the value 1 for a rapid-
response outcome of NEI, and the value 0 for a
rapid-response outcome of ICH. The first time the
cumulative sum for any arm(s) with the largest sum
was (were) 6 points ahead of the cumulative sum for
any arm(s) with the smallest sum, the arm(s) with
the smallest sum was (were) to be eliminated from
the study, meaning that those arms were no longer
to be considered candidates for selection and
patients were no longer to be randomized to
those arms. If one dose arm was eliminated at this
time, patients were to be randomized to the
remaining arms (and to rt-PA), and the procedure
was to proceed with their corresponding cumula-
tive sums continued at their current tallies, until a
second and final arm was eliminated. Once the
second arm had been eliminated, the procedure
TNK-S2B trial of tenecteplase versus alteplase 399
http://ctj.sagepub.com Clinical Trials 2011; 8: 398­407
was to terminate and the remaining arm was to be
selected as the preferred dose of tenecteplase. If
initially two arms were eliminated simultaneously,
the procedure was to terminate then and select the
remaining arm as the preferred dose of tenecte-
plase. If dose selection occurred after complete
observation of the rapid responses from fewer than
100 tenecteplase-matched sets, randomization con-
tinued to either the selected dose of tenecteplase or
rt-PA until a total of 100 patients on each treatment
had been randomized, at which time the clinical
assessment for promise or futility was to be con-
ducted. If the dose selection occurred after com-
plete observation of the rapid responses from
between 100 and 150 tenecteplase-matched sets,
randomization was to stop and the clinical assess-
ment for promise or futility was to take place then.
If no dose selection had yet occurred after complete
observation of the rapid responses from 150
tenecteplase-matched sets, the procedure was to
be truncated, i.e., randomization would stop, and
the dose selection was to be completed in conjunc-
tion with the clinical assessment for promise or
futility as described below. The selection criterion
of a lead of 6 was chosen to achieve a probability of
correct selection of !0.8 under the design alternative
probabilities of 0.31, 0.21, and 0.21 for the rapid-
response outcome of MNI for the three tenecteplase
doses, assuming a common probability of ICH of
0.06 for each dose. A phase I pilot study of
tenecteplase [6] had shown substantially larger
differences in the proportion of subjects with MNI
between tenecteplase doses: 36% of subjects given
0.1 mg/kg had MNI compared with 16% of subjects
given 0.4 mg/kg. The literature also showed that
ICH rates of approximately 6% are typical with
rt-PA administration [7]. The truncation point was
selected small enough to achieve a feasible
maximum recruitment, yet sufficiently large to
preserve the probability of correct selection.
The operating characteristics of the selection
procedure were estimated by simulation based on
100,000 replications for each scheme, and are
presented in Table 1. P[cs] refers to the probability
of correct selection, i.e. reaching a final elimination
by the stated criterion with a correct selection of
the best dose at or before the 150th matched set.
The value for P[cs] does not include any correct
selections that might also occur at truncation time
by clinical decision criteria should a final winner not
be declared by 150 matched sets. E[min(N(1),m)]
refers to the expected time of first elimination or
150 triplets, whichever occurs first. This gives the
average number of matched triplets until the earlier
of the first dose elimination or the end of the phase
II trial; multiplying by 3 gives the number of
patients randomized to this point in the procedure.
E[min(N,m)] refers to the expected time of final
elimination or 150 matched sets, whichever occurs
first. This gives the average number of matched sets
until a dose is selected or 150 matched sets have
been randomized, whichever occurs first. One
cannot multiply this number by 3 to get the total
number of patients in the selection phase because
of the possibility of early elimination of a dose. We
therefore provide another operating characteristic,
E[T], the expected total number of patients ran-
domized in the selection phase. Also, provided are
the median and modal numbers of matched sets
(approximate to the nearest integer). Finally,
P[no winner] refers to the probability that trunca-
tion time will arrive without achievement of
the stated criterion for a final dose selection.
In symbols, P[no winner] ¼ P[N > 150]. In all
cases, the probability of selecting an incorrect
dose is given by 1 À P[cs] À P[no winner]. Table 1

aWhen the doses have equal probability of MNI and symptomatic ICH (as in the scheme presented in the last column), selection of any
of the three doses is `correct' with respect to the probability of MNI net of symptomatic ICH. In this case, the first row gives the
probability of selecting the first listed doses. Exactly the same figure applies to the other two doses.

schemes in which one dose is superior and the
two inferior doses are equal in probabilities of MNI
and symptomatic ICH; this is often called a `least
favorable configuration.' The `best' dose in Table 1
appears in the first row of each scheme. See
Appendix (supplementary material) for the operat-
ing characteristics under five other schemes of
interest.
Preliminary comparisons of the clinical efficacy
and safety endpoints
The preliminary assessment for promise or futility
at the end of phase II was based on the modified
Rankin scale [8] observed 3 months after random-
ization, trichotomized into three ordered catego-
ries. The best category was Rankin score 0 or 1 (good
outcome); the worst category was Rankin score 4, 5,
or 6 (poor outcome, including death); and the
intermediate category was Rankin score 2 or 3
(neither, i.e., neither poor nor good outcome). There
were three sets of clinical decision rules for declar-
ing promise or futility, depending on the relative
safety profile of (the selected dose of) tenecteplase
compared to rt-PA.
Scenario 1: Tenecteplase showed a lower symptom-
atic ICH rate than rt-PA, defined as tenecteplase having
at least 2 fewer symptomatic ICHs than rt-PA on the
rapid-response outcome. In this situation, declare
tenecteplase promising if the observed proportion
of patients with poor outcome is less than or equal
to that of rt-PA. If the proportion with poor
outcome on tenecteplase is greater than on rt-PA,
declare further study unpromising. In addition, and
consistent with the interim monitoring plan for
safety and efficacy, declare further study unprom-
ising if the proportion of good outcomes for
tenecteplase is significantly less than for rt-PA at
the nominal two-tailed 0.001 level.
Scenario 2: The rate of symptomatic ICH within 24 h
for tenecteplase was effectively the same as for rt-PA,
defined as tenecteplase having the same number of ICHs
as rt-PA or differing at most by plus or minus one ICH.
In this situation, declare tenecteplase promising if
the proportion of patients on tenecteplase with
poor Rankin outcome is at least 8 percentage points
lower than on rt-PA (i.e., an arithmetic difference of
0.08). If not, declare further study unpromising. As
in Scenario 1, also declare further study unpromis-
ing if the proportion of good outcomes for
tenecteplase is significantly less than for rt-PA at
the nominal two-tailed 0.001 level.
Scenario 3: Tenecteplase showed a higher symptom-
atic ICH rate than rt-PA, defined as tenecteplase having
two or more ICHs than rt-PA. In this situation,
declare further study unpromising.
These rules for declaring promise or futility were
clinical decision rules and were not based on
statistical significance criteria (except where the
interim monitoring plan would suggest that the
DSMB consider early stopping of the study). While
somewhat arbitrary, they reflected the clear wishes
of the clinical investigator, and provided unambig-
uous grounds for the required clinical decision
making at the end of phase II. They can also be
viewed as another statistical selection procedure: at
this point in the trial, we would need to select
between two alternative courses ­ `to go' or `not to
go' on to phase III ­ with a procedure that would
provide a high probability of correct selection in
the event there was a truly superior choice.
It is possible that the selection procedure might
observe 150 matched sets without arriving at a
selection decision. In that case, the following
clinical criteria would be used to select a dose
from the remaining two or three competing arms
and determine promise or futility.
Criterion 1: Select the dose that allows continu-
ation into phase III based on the futility criteria
specified above. If no dose would allow continua-
tion of the study based on the futility criteria,
further study with any of the three doses would be
declared unpromising.
Criterion 2: If under Criterion 1 more than one
dose would allow continuation of the trial, select
the tenecteplase dose with the lowest ICH rate.
Criterion 3: If under Criterion 2 more than
one dose would allow continuation of the trial,
select the dose with the lowest proportion of poor
outcomes.
Criterion 4: If under Criterion 3 more than one
dose would allow continuation of the trial, select
the dose with the highest proportion of good outcomes.
See Appendix for further discussion.
Continuation of the study in phase III
If the selected dose of tenecteplase showed promise,
a total of at most 1908 patients were to be
randomized in phase III to the selected dose of
tenecteplase or rt-PA (954 per group, including the
patients studied in these two arms during phase II).
The primary endpoint for phase III was the
trichotomized Rankin score. Two co-primary null
hypotheses were to be tested in phase III: (1) The
proportion of poor outcomes with tenecteplase at
the selected dose did not differ from the proportion
of poor outcomes with rt-PA. (2) The proportion of
good outcomes with tenecteplase at the selected
dose did not differ from the proportion of good
outcomes with rt-PA. Each hypothesis was to be
tested using the Mantel­Haenszel score test, strat-
ified by site, with 1/2-continuity correction.
TNK-S2B trial of tenecteplase versus alteplase 401
http://ctj.sagepub.com Clinical Trials 2011; 8: 398­407
The two hypotheses were to be tested at the overall
two-tailed  ¼ 0.05 level using the Holm step-down
procedure [9], which controls the probability of
making one or two type I errors at no more than
0.05. The planned sample size of 1,908 (954 per
group) would provide 90% power to detect a !8%
reduction in poor outcome without a reduction in
good outcome, or 89% power to detect an 8%
increase in good outcome without an increase in
poor outcome.
We formulated the two co-primary hypotheses
to allow for a treatment effect at either end of
the Rankin scale. This also facilitated identifying
the `win/lose' situations for tenecteplase, as
required by regulatory reviewers. For example, if
tenecteplase were no better than a placebo, it would
reduce the proportion of poor outcomes due to
ICH, although it would also have poor efficacy
compared to rt-PA. This would not be a `win'
situation.
The phase III trial was to incorporate four formal
interim analyses and one final analysis. The first
interim analysis was to take place at the end of
phase II after enrollment of between 200 and 300
patients in the two phase III arms (between 100 and
150 patients per arm, and not counting the other
arms used in the selection stage). The second, third,
and fourth interim analyses were to take place after
follow-up was completed for a total of 500, 1,000,
and 1,500 patients, respectively. The terminal
analysis was to take place after a total of 1908
patient observations were complete, assuming no
early termination.
Figure 1 contains a graphical representation
of the win-lose-type situations for tenecteplase in
the interim analyses and the terminal analysis,
using barycentric coordinates. Any point in
the triangle represents a triplet consisting of the
probabilities of poor, neither, and good outcome;
the perpendicular distance of the point from any
one of the three sides represents the probability
of the outcome denoted by the vertex opposite
that side.
At each interim analysis, formal tests of the two
primary hypotheses were to be conducted, each at
the two-tailed  ¼ 0.001 level. Assuming both null
hypotheses to be true, rejection of either at any
interim analysis would constitute at least one type I
error. At the terminal analysis, assuming no earlier
stopping, each primary hypothesis was to be tested
at the nominal  ¼ 0.025 level with 1/2-continuity
correction.
Type I error control in seamless phase II/III trials
poses unresolved issues, particularly when, as here,
phase II involves a selection procedure rather than
a hypothesis test. Two are particularly important in
the current case.
Multiple testing
No correction for multiple testing is needed
because the phase III component of the trial does
not compare each competing dose of tenecteplase
with rt-PA; it performs only one hypothesis test of
the selected dose of tenecteplase versus rt-PA (for
each of the two co-primary endpoints). The inferior
tenecteplase doses are eliminated in phase II by a
selection procedure, not a hypothesis test against
rt-PA; moreover, the selection procedure uses an
outcome different from (although correlated with)
that in phase III. Thus, although the hypothesis
tested in phase III is determined by the selection
procedure, there is only one hypothesis test for
each co-primary endpoint. Since no more than a
single type I error can be committed, the need for
adjustment for multiple testing does not arise.
Selection bias
The selection procedure does slightly inflate the
type I error rate. However, we show in a fixed
sample size simulation study (see below, and the
Appendix) that without stopping for futility or
efficacy in interim monitoring, this inflation is
more than compensated for by the 1/2-continuity
correction's reduction in the type I error rate. We
also show below, in a group sequential study, that
the clinical criteria for futility stopping even with
interim monitoring reduce the type I error rate
further below nominal levels. Given this, no cor-
rection for selection bias resulting from the selec-
tion procedure is necessary.
Design of the type I error rate
simulation studies
Given the complex design of TNK-S2B, simulation
studies were required to demonstrate that the
statistical analysis plan specified above does in
fact control the type I error rate for the phase III
trial at or below nominal levels. We conducted two
such studies. One, the Group Sequential (GS) study,
is presented here. A second, the Fixed Sample Size
(FSS) study, is included as an Appendix. As argued
above, there was only one hypothesis test contem-
plated from the beginning of phase II to the end of
phase III, that of the selected tenecteplase dose
versus rt-PA, and hence the type I error rate we refer
to here is indeed an unconditional, experiment-
wise error rate and not conditioned on the identity
of the dose selected.
The FSS study considers a simplified version of
the TNK-S2B trial design in which dose selection is

possible; there is no examination of clinical out-
come data for promise or futility; and the trial
proceeds to a single final analysis with a total of
1,908 patients, 954 in the selected tenecteplase arm
and 954 in the rt-PA arm, with no stopping for
futility or for strong showing of interim efficacy. Its
purpose is to highlight the simultaneous effects of
the dose selection from stage 1 and the 1/2-
continuity correction, which would otherwise be
dominated by the larger effect of the examination
for promise or futility and the effect of interim
monitoring. See Appendix for details.
The GS simulation study
The purpose of the GS study is to simulate the full
TNK-S2B trial, including the dose selection, exam-
ination for promise or futility, and phase III interim
monitoring features, to estimate their combined
impact on the type I error rates. All replications of
the GS study are used in the estimation of the error
rates. Note that according to the design, if the
actual trial stopped at the end of phase II for futility
because a selected dose lacked promise, or if there
was a failure to select a tenecteplase dose because all
competing doses lacked promise at truncation time,
there would be no phase III trial and hence no
declaration of significance and no type I errors
under the null hypothesis (unless a dose had a
significantly different probability of poor or good
outcome compared to rt-PA at the 0.001 level).
Thus, in the GS study, if a particular simulation
under a given null hypothesis scheme stops for
futility because a selected dose lacks promise
(without attaining statistical significance at the
two-tailed 0.001 level for either endpoint), we
count the simulation as contributing no type I
error. If the simulation results in a failure to select a
tenecteplase dose because all competing doses lack
promise at truncation time, we choose one dose at
random to test for statistical significance at the two-
tailed 0.001 level for both poor and good outcomes,
after which the simulated trial stops. On the other
hand, if at any interim analysis the two-tailed 0.001
significance level is attained for either poor or good
clinical outcome, or at the terminal analysis the
two-tailed 0.025 significance level is attained for
either poor or good clinical outcome, we count the
simulation as contributing at least one type I error.
Each simulation study used 40,000 replications
under each of 1000 different null hypothesis
schemes described below. Note that the Mantel­
Haenszel score test would have type I error rates
almost identical to that of a simple comparison of
pooled proportions, because in this trial the site-
stratified randomization procedure rendered the
stratification factor orthogonal to the treatment
assignment under the null hypothesis. Therefore,
for feasibility of the present type I error rate studies,
we used only the pooled z-score test for the equality
of two proportions with 1/2-continuity correction
for each primary hypothesis.
Specification of distribution schemes
The simulation of both rapid-response outcomes
and 3-month Rankin outcomes requires specifica-
tion of the joint distribution of two trichotomous
random variables, i.e., a 3 Â 3 table of joint prob-
abilities, for each treatment arm. We call such a set
of four 3 Â 3 tables a distribution scheme; 1000
different distribution schemes were used in the
simulation studies. Generation of these distribution
schemes is described in detail in the Appendix. In
the simulation studies, our goal was to produce a
set of distributions that would cover a portion of
the parameter space that was of direct clinical
interest to the TNK-S2B trial, and that the portion
covered was sufficiently broad as to represent type I
error rates accurately over the entire theoretical
parameter space. Let the three-category rapid
response be denoted by X, taking values of 0 for
ICH, 1 for neither MNI nor ICH, and 2 for MNI. Let
the trichotomized 3-month Rankin scale for the
clinical outcome be denoted by Y, taking values of
0 for poor outcome, 1 for neither poor nor good
outcome, and 2 for good outcome. Let the doses of
tenecteplase be labeled A, B, and C, corresponding
to 0.1, 0.25, and 0.40 mg/kg, respectively, and let
dose D refer to rt-PA. Let T denote any of these four
treatment arms. It is most convenient to determine
the joint distribution of (X, Y) by first specifying
P[X|T], and then specifying P[Y|X, T]. Once these
three-component vectors of probabilities are deter-
mined, random realizations of the pair (X, Y) can be
produced by generating a trinomial response X
following P[X|T], and then by generating another
trinomial response Y following P[Y|X, T]. In the
simulation studies, 10 different marginal condi-
tional distributions for X given T were selected at
random in a manner described in the Appendix; see
Figure 2(a) for visualizing these distributions. For
each one of these, 10 different marginal distribu-
tions for Y given T (identical for each T under the
null hypotheses) were generated randomly
(Figure 2(b)); and for each of the 10 Â 10 ¼ 100
pairs of marginal distributions for X and Y, 10
different conditional distributions for Y given X
and T were generated randomly, subject to the
marginalization constraint that the weighted average
of P[Y|X, T] using weights P[X|T] agree with the
given distribution P[Y|T], together with a clinical
monotonicity constraint that P[Y ¼ poor|X, T] is the
greatest when X ¼ ICH and least when X ¼ MNI,

and similarly, P[Y ¼ good|X, T] is the least when
X ¼ ICH and the greatest when X ¼ MNI. Thus,
10 Â 10 Â 10 ¼ 1000 different distribution schemes
were employed for the simulations. Figure 2(c)
contains a graphical representation of the complete
list of distributions, using barycentric coordinates,
displaying a uniform distribution of T over the
lower portion of the triangle. Figure 2(d) shows a
visual effect of the clinical monotonicity con-
straint. As stated above, we simulated 40,000 trial
replications for each distribution scheme. Each
replication generated random samples of up to
150 pairs of outcomes (X, Y) for each member of a
quadruplet or matched set for the selection stage,

Results
In the GS study, the type I errors were all well below
their nominal levels, by about one-third. Table 2
shows that the average two-tailed type I error rate
(averaged across all 1,000 distribution schemes) was
approximately 0.009 for both poor and good out-
comes. Among the 2,000 hypothesis tests con-
ducted among the 1,000 distribution schemes, the
maximum estimated type I error was approximately
0.019. The third panel of Table 2 shows that the
average of the overall type I error rate for the two
primary outcomes (i.e., the probability of at least
one type I error) was approximately 0.018, with
maximum value approximately 0.038. The type I
error rate is evidently under good control.
These results show that the inflation in the type I
error rates caused by the dose selection and
repeated looks at the data in interim analyses is
more than offset by the reduction in the type I error
rate caused by implementing the clinical stopping
rules for futility at the first interim analysis. In the
GS study, selection in the phase II component
somewhat elevates the probability of declaring the
selected dose of tenecteplase significantly better
than rt-PA with respect to poor outcome, while it
simultaneously decreases somewhat the probability
of declaring the selected dose of tenecteplase
significantly worse than rt-PA. The average type I
error rate in the former tail was 0.0069 while that in
the latter tail was 0.0022. Analogous results were
obtained for good outcome. The average type I
error rate for declaring the selected dose of
tenecteplase significantly better than rt-PA with
respect to good outcome was 0.0061 while the
average type I error rate for declaring the selected
dose of tenecteplase significantly worse than rt-PA
was 0.0027. Note how the asymmetrical allocations
of type I error counterbalance each other, such that
the sum of the error rates in the two tails are within
nominal levels. It is entirely acceptable for a two-
tailed test to employ an asymmetrical allocation of
total type I error in the two tails, so long as the total
type I error rate is within nominal levels [10].
Similar results were obtained in the FSS study, and
are described in detail in the Appendix.
Discussion
The TNK-S2B trial employed an innovative, ran-
domized, seamless phase IIB/III design to test
tenecteplase versus standard-dose rt-PA in the treat-
ment of patients with acute ischemic stroke within
3 h of onset. For the phase II part of the trial, we
chose an adaptive sequential dose selection proce-
dure that employed a rapid assessment of MNI at 24
h balanced against occurrence of symptomatic ICH
to choose among three different doses of
tenecteplase.
Regulatory reviewers questioned three aspects of
the control of the type I error rate. The first
concerned whether or not multiple comparisons
techniques were required given that the trial began
with three doses of tenecteplase, and whether or
not an adjustment for selection effects was needed.
We have addressed those concerns above.
Reviewers were further concerned that the type I
error rate would not be controlled under schemes
which would not occur under the protocol, e.g., if
the trial were continued into phase III absent
clinical criteria for promising efficacy. We under-
stand the concern, in that noncompliance with
prespecified protocols is a major problem when it
occurs, as it often has. However, this would have
been in violation of the clearly specified trial
protocol, which stated the futility stopping require-
ments as rules rather than guidelines. It has been
accepted in the ongoing dialog between researchers
and regulators that adaptive designs must be
prespecified rather than ad hoc. This presupposes
and requires respect for the prespecified protocol,
under which the type I error rate is computed.

Ultimately, one cannot assure type I error control
under arbitrary protocol violations. This applies
with equal force to traditional as well as adaptive
trial designs.
Finally, a reviewer was doubtful whether any
amount of simulations could demonstrate adequate
control of the type I error rate. However, simula-
tions are recognized under the FDA draft guidance
document [2], and given the coverage of the
parameter space in ours, it seemed to us unreason-
able to sustain such doubt. Clarification is needed
whether control of the error rate must be demon-
strated by theorems or can be demonstrated by
simulation. In addition, a sensitive reviewer of this
article suggested that the regulatory agency's con-
cern might be allayed by a commitment from the
trial investigators to submit interim analysis results
to it as these analyses occur. This proposal merits
consideration.
In summary, the TNK-S2B trial design, while
complex, was innovative and efficient. Its statistical
analysis plan had great integrity. Under the proto-
col, it would have controlled the unconditional
type I error rate below the nominal 0.05 level for
the two primary hypothesis tests in phase III, and
experiment-wise. The trial provides several lessons
for adaptive designs. (a) Time must be allowed for
iterative communications with regulatory reviewers
from the first stages of the design and planning
process, as the recent FDA draft guidance document
stresses [2]. (b) Type I error control must be clearly
demonstrated. (c) Greater clarity is needed on
whether this includes demonstration that type I
error control will be maintained if the protocol is
violated, and on whether or not simulations are an
acceptable form of demonstration. (d) Regulatory
agency concerns that the protocol for futility
stopping may not be followed may be allayed by a
commitment to submit all interim analysis results
to the regulatory agency as these analyses occur.
Future trials with similar potential to TNK-S2B will
have a greater probability of success if these issues
can be successfully addressed.
