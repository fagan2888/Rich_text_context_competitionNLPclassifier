National Trends in Visit Rates
and Antibiotic Prescribing for Adults
With Acute Sinusitis
Acute sinusitis is diagnosed in over 3 million vis-
its annually among adults and children in the
United States.1 Of these, more than 80% result
in an antibiotic prescription1; however, many of these pre-
scriptions may be unnecessary,2,3 since sinusitis is most
often of viral origin and benefits of antibiotics may be
limited.4 Prior to 2012, amoxicillin was the recom-
mended empirical treatment for acute bacterial sinus-
itis; current guidelines now recommend amoxicillin-
clavulanate.5-7 In light of recent studies4 and new treatment
guidelines,7 we sought to examine visit rates and antibi-
otic prescribing patterns for adults with acute sinusitis
in the United States.
Methods. We analyzed data from the National Ambula-
tory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hos-
pital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) be-
tween 2000 and 2009 to estimate visit rates and antibiotic
prescribing for acute sinusitis in adults. We estimated the
annual number of acute sinusitis visits per 1000 adults
in the United States. Acute sinusitis was designated for
visits in which any of 3 diagnosis fields contained the In-
ternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clini-
cal Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for acute sinusitis
(461.x). We excluded visits for acute sinusitis that had
concomitant diagnoses that could potentially require an-
tibiotics (eg, urinary tract infections) and visits that re-
sulted in hospital admission. We also excluded visits
where an aminoglycoside or vancomycin was pre-
scribed, since those patients were presumed to have more
serious or atypical infections.
In analyses of antibiotic selection, we restricted our
sample to those visits where acute sinusitis was the pri-
mary diagnosis. The primary outcome measures were the
proportion of visits for acute sinusitis in which any an-
tibiotic was prescribed (antibiotic visits) and the pro-
portion of antibiotic visits in which amoxicillin was
prescribed.
All statistical analyses were performed using STATA
11 software (StataCorp) and accounted for the compo-
nents of the complex survey design. For analysis of time
trends, we grouped the survey data and census denomi-
nators in five 2-year intervals as recommended by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics.
Results. Between 2000 and 2009, there was a mean of
4.3 million (95% CI, 3.6-4.9 million) outpatient visits per
year. Acute sinusitis was diagnosed in 0.5% (95% CI, 0.4%-
0.5%) of all outpatient visits among adults during this
period. The annual visit rate averaged 19.4 visits (95%
CI, 16.5-22.3) per 1000 adults and did not change dur-
ing the study period.
Antibiotics were prescribed in 83% (95% CI, 78%-
86%) of visits for acute sinusitis, and this proportion did
not change significantly during the study period (P=.85),
which ranged from 74% (95% CI, 62%-83%) to 87% (95%
CI, 78%-93%) of visits during this period. In addition,
there were no changes in the overall rates of prescribing
for any specific antibiotic class or antibiotic agent among
visits (n=1934) where an antibiotic was prescribed. The
proportion of visits in which amoxicillin, the recom-
mended agent, was prescribed was 17% (95% CI, 12%-
23%) (Figure). Among the antibiotics prescribed other
than amoxicillin, the most commonly prescribed were
macrolides (29%), quinolones (19%), and amoxicillin-
clavulanate (16%).
Comment. In the present study, using a nationally rep-
resentative data set of ambulatory visits, we found that
more than 80% of patients diagnosed as having acute si-
nusitis receive an antibiotic, despite mounting evidence
that the benefits of antibiotic treatment for sinusitis are
limited. Furthermore, we found that nearly 50% of pa-
tients diagnosed as having acute sinusitis received either
a macrolide or a quinolone, while fewer than 20% re-
ceived amoxicillin, the recommended first-line treat-
ment during the study period. The frequent use of mac-
rolides, as shown in this study, is particularly concerning
because macrolide use has been associated with treat-
ment failures for respiratory tract infections.8 Although
likely to be effective, fluoroquinolones are usually un-
necessary for sinusitis, and overuse is an important risk
factor for colonization and infection with resistant
organisms.9

This study highlights that prescribing of broad-

macrolides, is extremelycommon.This is an importanttar-
get for antimicrobial stewardship efforts partially because
the benefits of antibiotic therapy are limited. Qualitative
research to explore the health care provider and patient at-
titudes that influence antibiotic selection is a next step to
understanding the problem. Also critically important are
adoption of clinical guidelines that promote appropriate
antibiotic use.7 Changes in prescribing behavior of health
care providers for sinusitis are urgently needed to im-
prove health care quality and stem the rising tide of anti-
biotic resistance in the United States.

Periprocedural Management of the Patient
With Diabetes Mellitus Undergoing
Coronary Angiography: Current Practice
Despite advances in procedural technique and
pharmacotherapy, patients with diabetes melli-
tus (DM) experience worse outcomes than pa-
tients without DM undergoing percutaneous coronary in-
tervention (PCI).1 Periprocedural hyperglycemia is
associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients un-
dergoing PCI,2-5 and studies have suggested that treat-
ing periprocedural hyperglycemia may improve out-
comes by attenuating glucose-mediated ischemic injury
at the time of PCI.6,7 Simple preventive strategies, such
as continuing long-acting hypoglycemic medications, have
not been evaluated, and there are no guidelines for peri-
procedural use of these medications.
We conducted an anonymous electronic survey of car-
diologists referring patients for coronary angiography
using the American Heart Association Cardiology Fel-
lows Society of Greater New York and the Society of Car-
diovascular Angiography and Interventions from March
through July 2011. Of the 144 survey responders, 24%
were fellows-in-training, and 33% were faculty at a medi-
cal school. Among this cohort, 60% believed that hyper-
glycemia at the time of PCI is harmful, and 94% be-
lieved that hypoglycemia at the time of PCI is harmful.
Although most clinicians routinely hold oral hypogly-
cemic medications prior to angiography, substantial num-
bers do not, with nearly half routinely continuing thiazo-
lidinediones on the morning of coronary angiography
(Table). Clinicians are more likely to continue insulin-
based regimens than oral medications, but again there is
nouniformityofpractice.InpatientswithuncontrolledDM
(glycosylatedhemoglobinlevel10%orbloodglucoselev-
els 200 mg/dL), a little more than one-third of physi-
cians reported they would change their usual practice and
continue hypoglycemic medications prior to coronary an-
giography. (To convert glycosylated hemoglobin to a pro-
portion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01; to convert
serum glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555.)
