Abstract
Background: The joint impact of sedentary behavior and physical activity on obesity has not been
assessed in a large cohort followed from adolescence to adulthood.
Methods: Nationally representative longitudinal data from Waves II (1995; mean age: 15.9) and III
(2001; mean age: 21.4) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 9,155) were
collected. Sex-stratified multivariate logistic regression analysis assessed the odds of obesity
associated with Wave II MVPA and screen time, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics
and change in MVPA and screen time from Wave II to III. Obesity was defined using body mass
index (BMI, kg/m2) International Obesity Task Force cut-points at Wave II and adult cut-points at
Wave III (BMI  30).
Results: In males, adjusted odds of prevalent obesity was strongly predicted by MVPA bouts [OR
(95% CI): OR6 vs. 1 MVPA bouts
= 0.50 (0.40, 0.62); OR4 vs. 40 hrs screen time
= 0.83 (0.69, 1.00)]. In females,
greater MVPA bouts and lower screen time correlated with lower prevalent obesity [OR (95% CI):
OR6 vs. 1 MVPA bouts
= 0.67 (0.49, 0.91); OR4 vs. 40 hrs screen time
= 0.67 (0.53, 0.85)]. Longitudinally,
adolescent screen time hours had a stronger influence on incident obesity in females [OR (95% CI):
OR4 vs. 40 hrs
= 0.58 (0.43, 0.80)] than males [OR (95% CI): OR4 vs. 40 hrs
= 0.78 (0.61, 0.99)].
Longitudinal activity patterns were not predictive of incident obesity.
Conclusion: Reducing screen time during adolescence and into adulthood may be a promising
strategy for reducing obesity incidence, especially in females.
Background
Obesity is a major and rapidly growing global public
health concern and is associated with significant morbid-
ity and mortality [1-3]. In the past three decades, obesity
has tripled among adolescents [4] and more than doubled
among 20­39 year olds in the U.S. [5]. A substantial
amount of weight gain [6-9], concomitant with precipi-
tous declines in physical activity [10-13], occurs in the
transition from adolescence to young adulthood.
Physical activity and sedentary behavior have become
major focal areas in obesity research, interventions, and

policies. Both have been linked to obesity among adoles-
cents [14-17] and adults [18-20] in observational studies
and assessed as target behaviors in randomized controlled
trials among young children and adolescents [21-25], but
full understanding of optimal behavior patterns for obes-
ity prevention is far from complete. Sedentary behaviors,
such as television viewing and computer games, may
influence energy balance through displacement of physi-
cal activity [26], increased energy intake [27,28], or
reduced metabolic rate [29]. Sedentary behaviors are gen-
erally more strongly and consistently associated with
obesity than physical activity [16], and are thus com-
monly targeted by interventionists working with young
populations.
Physical activity and sedentary behavior often co-occur
[30,31] despite being inversely correlated [26,32], but
there are few studies that examine their combined effects
on obesity development over time. Furthermore, longitu-
dinal effects from adolescence to adulthood are particu-
larly important due to high risk of obesity onset and the
abundance of changes in lifestyle and environment dur-
ing this transition period [33,34]. Unfortunately, longitu-
dinal studies examining physical activity and sedentary
activity in relation to obesity are sparse: the only American
observational cohort that captures the adolescent to adult-
hood transition is limited to females in three cities [17];
international studies that capture this lifecycle phase
assess sedentary activity [15,35] or physical activity
[36,37], but not both; and randomized controlled trials
are usually of short duration (less than one year) [21-
24,38] and do not continue into young adulthood [25].
In this study, we assess the combined association of mod-
erate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and TV/video
viewing (screen time) on incident obesity in a large
nationally representative survey of adolescents followed
through young adulthood. We hypothesized that cross-
sectional and longitudinal patterns of physical activity
would mitigate the adverse association between sedentary
behavior and both current and incident obesity.
Methods
Study Population
The study population includes more than 20,000 individ-
uals enrolled in The National Longitudinal Study of Ado-
lescent Health (Add Health), a prospective cohort study of
adolescents, representative of the U.S. school-based pop-
ulation in grades 7 to 12 in 1994­95, and followed into
adulthood. Add Health included a core sample plus sub-
samples of selected minority and other groupings col-
lected under protocols approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. The survey design and sampling frame have
been discussed elsewhere [39]. Add Health includes three
waves: Wave I (1995) did not collect measured height and
weight, so we used Wave II (13,570 eligible adolescents,
measured April to August, 1996) and Wave III (14,322 eli-
gible young adults, measured August 2001 and April
2002) samples in the current analysis (10,828 total eligi-
ble longitudinal respondents). Wave II followed the
school-based sample of adolescents who did not graduate
prior to 1996; high school dropouts and older high school
students were included. Eligible respondents included
those with sample weights. Females reporting pregnancy
for Wave II or Wave III (n = 378) and individuals who
used a walking aid (e.g., cane, crutches, or wheelchair) (n
= 57); were less than 13 or greater 20 years of age at Wave
II, or less than 19 or greater than 26 years of age at Wave
III (n = 115); or had incomplete physical activity, seden-
tary behavior, height, weight, or relevant demographic
data (n = 1,231) were excluded from analysis. Less than
7% of Wave II respondents were between 18 and 20 years
­ these were typically older adolescents who were still
enrolled in school; despite being older than adolescent
chronological age, they were retained in the Wave II sam-
ple: (a) to maintain consistency with the sampling design
for national representation and (b) based on their lifecy-
cle stage "of school-age" in terms of social influences and
life stage. Our final sample includes 9,155 adolescents,
13­20 years of age (mean = 15.9 ± 0.12) at Wave II and
19­26 years of age (mean = 21.4 ± 0.11) at Wave III for
descriptive and logistic regression analysis.
Study Variables
Wave II and III in-home surveys of study participants pro-
vided physical activity, sedentary behavior, and body
mass index [BMI: weight (kg)/height (m2)] data. Wave I
in-home surveys of parents provided income and educa-
tion data. Education was the highest level of education
attained by either parent. Where missing (n = 1,502;
13.9%), income was imputed using a method similar to
that used in other national surveys to deal with missing
data [40,41]. Race and ethnicity were determined prima-
rily from adolescent self-report; parent interviews were
used as a secondary source.
Obesity
Body Mass Index (BMI) was computed from measured
height and weight at Waves II and III. Adolescent respond-
ents were classified as obese at Wave II using International
Obesity Task Force (IOTF) BMI  30 kg/m2-equivalent
age- and sex-specific BMI cut-points [42]. The IOTF cut-
points provide comparability to otherwise discrepant
obesity definitions for adolescents and adults [6,42],
which is vital for longitudinal analysis spanning the ado-
lescent and adult years. At Wave III, when respondents
were 19 years and older, the adult obesity cut point (BMI
 30 kg/m2) was used [43,44]. Incident obesity was
defined as BMI  30 kg/m2 among Wave III respondents
International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2007, 4:26 http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/4/1/26

who were not obese (BMI below the age- and sex-specific
IOTF obesity cutpoint) at Wave II.
Physical Activity and Screen Time
Described in detail elsewhere [45,46], Add Health surveys
employed a standard activity recall. While the recall has
not undergone validity or reliability testing, it was based
on self-report questionnaires that have been validated in
other large-scale epidemiologic studies with regard to
physical activity [47]. However, validation of self-reported
sedentary behavior is scant [48]. In this study, physical
activity was defined as weekly frequency of moderate to
vigorous physical activity (MVPA; includes skating &
cycling, exercise, and active sports), hereafter referred to as
"bouts". Screen time was defined as hours of television
and video viewing per week. The screen time distribution
included a very long tail; thus, screen time greater than 80
hours per week (Wave II: 81­120 hours, n = 131, 1.2%;
Wave III: 81­198 hours, n = 119, 1.1%) was truncated at
80 hours in order to stabilize regression estimates. Longi-
tudinal measures were created as change variables, repre-
senting the change in MVPA bouts and truncated screen
time hours from Wave II to Wave III.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata, version
9.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) [49]. Descriptive
analyses used post-stratification sample weights for
national representation; adjusted Wald tests compared
means and design-based F-tests compared distribution of
categorical variables between obese and non-obese sub-
groups. All analyses used multiple stages of cluster sam-
pling to adjust for survey design effects.
All analyses were stratified by sex due to known differ-
ences in physical activity and sedentary behavior patterns
between males and females [12,34]. Logistic regression
models were used to assess correlates of adolescent obes-
ity status (Wave II) and predictors of obesity incidence
from adolescence to young adulthood (Wave II to Wave
III). Wave II obesity prevalence models included Wave II
physical activity and Wave II screen time. Wave III obesity
incidence models excluded respondents obese at Wave II
and assessed Wave II physical activity, Wave II screen
time, and physical activity & screen time change variables
(Wave III-Wave II). All quadratic terms related to physical
activity or screen time and all potential interactions
between Wave II physical activity and screen time and
change variables were assessed in each model; non-signif-
icant (p  0.10) terms were excluded. Age, race/ethnicity
(White, Black, Native American, Asian, Hispanic), house-
hold income tertile, and highest parental education are
established confounders in behavior-obesity relation-
ships, so they were included in all models. Due to less
consistent relationships involving season, smoking status,
and geographic region, we tested these variables empiri-
cally for confounding and included them in the model as
control variables if their inclusion resulted in at least a
10% change in estimate of the odds ratio for obesity
related to physical activity and/or screen time.
To illustrate the effects of shifts in continuous physical
activity and screen time variables on incident obesity,
model estimates were used to (1) calculate odds ratios for
incident obesity and (2) predict obesity incidence based
on assigned physical activity and sedentary behavior pro-
files. Odds ratios compare selected physical activity and
screen time levels to an "undesirable" referent profile of
low physical activity (1 bout per week) and high screen
time (40 hours per week). These values correspond to the
10th and 90th percentiles, respectively, at Wave II for the
total sample; there was no reason to suspect differential
reporting or differential associations with obesity by sex,
so combined values for males and females were used to
provide consistent comparisons.
Given the complexity of our models, involving quadratic
terms and change variables, we used coefficients from the
models along with experimentally assigned physical activ-
ity and screen time values to predict obesity incidence. We
(a) fit logistic models of obesity incidence from adoles-
cence to young adulthood (Wave II to Wave III) including
Wave II physical activity, Wave II screen time, and physi-
cal activity and screen time change variables (Wave III-
Wave II), (b) assigned specified physical activity-screen
time combinations to all members of the cohort, then (c)
applied model coefficients from (a) to the experimentally
assigned physical activity and screen time values. These
results provide predicted obesity incidence at specified
physical activity and screen time levels, providing the
opportunity for "natural" experiments involving simu-
lated manipulations of the activity and screen time pro-
files and, as such, aiding in the interpretation of model
results.
Results
Sample characteristics
A total of 4,879 males and 4,276 females met study crite-
ria. Obesity prevalence by sex and wave of survey are pre-
sented in Table 1. A considerable proportion of males
(11.5%) and (10.9%) of females were obese at Wave II,
and rates approximately doubled by Wave III to 21.1% for
males and 23.9% for females. Obesity incidence from
Wave II to III was 13.2% (SE = 0.76) among males and
15.9% (SE = 0.96) among females.
At Waves II and III, obesity prevalence was similar by
smoking status and, except for males at Wave II, season.
Obesity prevalence was significantly higher among those
with lower household income and, except for males at

Wave III, lower parental education. Among females, obes-
ity prevalence also varied by race at both waves and region
at Wave III (Table 1). Non-obese females were slightly
younger than obese females at both waves (Table 2).
Descriptive statistics for physical activity and screen time
by sex, wave of survey, and obesity status are presented in
Table 2. At Wave II, non-obese males and females
reported more physical activity and less screen time than
obese males and females. Males not obese at Wave III
experienced a slightly greater decline in physical activity
from Wave II to Wave III than those who were obese.
Females not obese at Wave III reported less screen time at
Wave III and nearly no change in screen time from Wave
II to Wave III as opposed to an increase in screen time
among females obese at Wave III.
Cross-Sectional association between physical activity &
sedentary behavior and obesity during adolescence
Among males, odds of prevalent obesity during adoles-
cence were lower with more bouts of physical activity and
higher, although to a lesser degree, with more hours of
screen time (Table 3). Among females, both physical
activity and screen time were strong correlates of odds of
obesity, although physical activity suggested a slight curvi-
linear relationship in which odds of obesity peaked at two
to three physical activity bouts per week.

screen time during adolescence as well as an increase in
screen time from adolescence to early adulthood (Table
4). Neither physical activity during adolescence nor
change in physical activity significantly predicted incident
obesity in males. Similar to the cross-sectional analysis,
there was a slight curvilinear relationship for physical
activity among females.
Relative odds of incident obesity from adolescence to young
adulthood
Based on coefficients from the model displayed in Table
4, Table 5 presents odds ratios for Wave III incident obes-
ity at selected levels (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th percentiles)
of Wave II physical activity & screen time for males and
females, respectively (referent profile: 1 bout of physical
activity and 40 hours screen time; all other variables were
held constant). Consistent with the model estimates, rela-
tive odds of incident obesity become more protective with
lower adolescent screen time regardless of physical activ-
ity. This association was more dramatic in females than in
males: for example, very low screen time (4 hours per
week) reduced relative odds of incident obesity by over
40% (OR4 hours, 1 bout
= 0.58) for females and over 20% for
males (OR4 hours, 1 bouts
= 0.78) with very low physical activ-
ity (1 bout MVPA per week). These patterns were similar
with negative, constant, and positive temporal shifts in
screen time. Furthermore, this pattern is nearly identical at
each level of physical activity, despite statistical signifi-
cance in the logistic regression model for females.
Adjusted obesity incidence from adolescence to young adulthood
Also based on model coefficients displayed in Table 4, Fig-
ure 1 shows predicted obesity incidence at experimentally
assigned combinations of physical activity and screen
time profiles (25th and 75th percentiles of MVPA and
screen time). Change in MVPA from Wave II to III was
held constant due to lack of statistical significance as
shown in Table 4, and change in screen time was not dis-
played because patterns were similar across the relatively
narrow range of observed values.

For both males and females, predicted obesity incidence
was highest for high screen time profiles during adoles-
cence and the effects of experimental changes in physical
activity were minimal, although the effects of experimen-
tal changes in screen time were more pronounced for
females than males. Given constant screen time, predicted
obesity incidence for males with low screen time (7 hours/
week) paired with high MVPA (5 bouts/week) during ado-
lescence was 12.4%, versus 14.1% for a less desirable pro-
file of high screen time (40 hours/week) and low MVPA (1
bout/week). In comparison, analogous predicted obesity
incidences for females were 13.7% and 17.6% (Figure 1).
Experimental profiles involving changes in screen time
produced similar patterns: reductions in screen time from
adolescence to adulthood predicted lower obesity inci-
dence, but not enough to overcome the obesity-promot-
ing associations of screen time during adolescence.

cohort, weekly hours of screen time during adolescence

ity in early adulthood. Fewer weekly hours of screen time
during adolescence reduced the relative odds of incident
obesity by over 40% among females and over 20% among
males. Contrary to our hypothesis, longitudinal patterns
of physical activity were less important predictors of inci-
dent obesity. Our results suggest that physical activity, if
not maintained, may not be protective in the long-term
and may not counteract the negative effects of screen time
during adolescence and over time. Declines in screen time
during the transition from adolescence to young adult-
hood were associated with lower obesity incidence, partic-
ularly for females, but not enough to overcome the
obesity-promoting effects of screen time during adoles-
cence. Our longitudinal results, including stronger results
for females [35], are consistent with other studies summa-
rized in a recent literature review [16] and in other recent
studies showing a positive relationship between sedentary
behavior and body weight [15,16,50] and no longitudinal
relationship between physical activity and obesity
[36,37], although existing literature is inconsistent.
In contrast, our cross sectional analysis suggests a strong
protective association between physical activity and prev-
alent obesity for adolescent males, while both physical
activity and screen time were important factors for adoles-
cent females. This protective cross-sectional association
between physical activity and obesity is not observed lon-
gitudinally, perhaps because such associations are dimin-
ished by other important lifestyle changes occurring
during this lifecycle period [51]. Gordon-Larsen et al.
showed a positive relationship between physical activity
and incident obesity among adolescents between Waves I
and II of Add Health [52], which is consistent with this
explanation because it studied a one year follow-up
period in contrast with the five year period assessed in the
current study. Additionally, as noted in the Must and
Tybor review [16], cross-sectional associations may reflect
causal effects of physical activity patterns on obesity, but
they could also reflect limited capacity to engage in exer-
cise or sports due to extreme obesity, lack of social support
for overweight or obese adolescents, or weight loss efforts.
In females, the likelihood of obesity peaked at two to
three MVPA bouts per week, perhaps reflecting reverse
causality as described above or inaccurate reporting of
MVPA. Those engaging in two or three bouts of MVPA
may have been more likely to exercise for weight loss or
maintenance and hence at greater risk of obesity. Alterna-
tively, reporting two or three bouts may reflect over-
reporting to a greater extent than those with high MVPA
frequency; that is, due to social desirability, those with no
MVPA may over-report within a reasonable range, result-
ing in high obesity prevalence and incidence in this MVPA
range.
For females, reduced screen time was associated with a
greater relative reduction of a larger absolute obesity inci-
dence than for males (13% for males versus 16% for
females), resulting in a greater potential impact of screen
time on obesity incidence. Assuming no change in screen
time, experimentally assigning low versus high screen
time led to predicted obesity incidence of approximately
14% and 18%, respectively (a 3 to 4 percentage point dif-
ference) for females and 12% and 14% (a 1 to 2 percent-
age point difference) for males. These results underscore
the potential public health impact of reducing screen time
during adolescence on controlling obesity incidence in
females in particular.
The association between screen time and incident obesity
may differ by sex due to biologic differences in changes in
energy expenditure in response to screen time, in the
effects of other lifestyle factors, misclassification biases by
sex, or, more likely, a combination of all three. Biologic
differences such as differential reductions in metabolic
rate while engaging in sedentary activity are not evident in
clinical research, but these studies are often limited to
young children or include only one sex [29,53]. Other
lifestyle factors such as changes in energy intake related to
television viewing [27,28] or concurrent activities while
watching television or videos could also differ between

males and females. Similarly, as hypothesized by Dunstan
et al. [54], screen time may be an indicator of sedentary
behaviors in general, including activities such as computer
use or reading, to a greater extent in females than males.
Unfortunately, we are not able to quantify energy intake
or overall energy expenditure in Add Health, so we were
unable to investigate this issue. Recent studies in adult
populations have demonstrated stronger associations
between television viewing and metabolic risk factors in
women than men [54-56], suggesting that this difference
is not spurious and reflects important sex differences in
the influence of screen time on obesity and obesity-related
conditions. In addition, findings point to questions
regarding assessment of screen time.
Regardless of the mechanism or whether it is a direct rela-
tionship ­ increased "junk food" consumption in
response to advertisements, deflated metabolic rate, or
some other factor ­ these results suggest that adolescent
females who watch less television and videos during ado-
lescence and/or reduce their viewing time from adoles-
cence to young adulthood are less likely to develop
obesity as they become young adults, regardless of their
physical activity level. Thus, reducing screen time during
adolescence is likely an essential component of obesity
prevention, particularly for females. Furthermore, the
level of screen time at which obesity odds were reduced in
this study are consistent with the American Academy of
Pediatrics recommendation [57] of 14 or fewer hours of
television viewing per week in pediatric populations.
There are some limitations of the current study. As noted
above, we could not assess energy intake, and activity data
are subject to self-report bias. Misclassification is probably
most dramatic among obese respondents reporting more
socially desirable behavior, which would have attenuated
the association between screen time and physical activity
with obesity. For the same reason, those becoming obese
between Waves II and III may have underreported screen
time and/or over-reported physical activity to a greater
extent at Wave III; this differential misclassification would
have also attenuated the observed association between
changes in these behaviors and Wave III incident obesity.
Second, the activity recall may not have captured all
MVPA performed by respondents, and the "bouts" of
activity classification is imprecise because each bout could
be of any duration. Both of these factors would be
expected to reduce precision and further dilute the appar-
ent influence of physical activity. Furthermore, MVPA
bouts may more accurately reflect physical activity level
during adolescence, when more easily recalled organized
sports practices and competitions are more common; this
bias could potentially explain the lack of association
between physical activity in young adulthood as well as
stronger association with screen time, which may be more
accurately reported, than physical activity. Finally,
unmeasured factors related to both screen time and obes-
ity such as an awareness of healthful behaviors could have
contributed to these findings.
Conclusion
Physical activity and sedentary behavior are common tar-
gets for obesity prevention and treatment, and this study
assesses the extent to which they predict obesity during a
critical period in which risk for obesity onset is high and
adult lifestyle takes shape. Our findings support public
health strategies for reducing obesity incidence in this
period that focus on reducing screen time during adoles-
cence and maintaining these screen time reductions into
young adulthood. Our research further suggests that phys-
ical activity during adolescence remains important for the
establishment of lifelong habits as well as short-term
weight maintenance, but that physical activity levels
would need to be increased substantially and sustained
into adulthood in order to counteract the negative effects
of screen time. Findings were complex for males and sug-
gest that identification of possible intervention points for
males is an important next step. Further investigation of
the mechanism through which screen time might influ-
ence development of obesity will help to guide potential
intervention strategies. Finally, additional randomized tri-
als that assess the combined effects of sedentary behavior
and physical activity on obesity over a long follow-up
period that captures the transition from adolescence to
adulthood might help to confirm or refute the causal
nature of these relationships.
