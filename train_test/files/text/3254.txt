Research Question
Although empirical work that is motivated by the financial accelerator approach intro-
duced by Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999) (BGG thereafter) often draws its at-
tention to yields of corporate bonds, in most of the theoretical models with BGG-type
frictions the debt instrument is seen as a loan without a market-determined price. From
this point of view, it is worthwhile to investigate whether market-based debt can directly
be included in the BGG framework instead of non-market-based debt.
Contribution
In this paper, we modifiy the financial accelerator approach by introducing market-based
debt instruments, i.e. we allow the debt to have a market-determined price. In addition,
we introduce a maturity structure for these corporate bonds. The modified financial
accelerator approach is then embedded into a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium model in order to investigate how the modifications change the transmission
of shocks.
Results
Our results show that, compared to the standard BGG framework, a dampening of shocks
can occur due to the price component in debt instruments. Price changes contribute
positively to the finance premium because the ability to service the debt is affected. This
result crucially depends on the average maturity of the bond portfolio. The resulting
attenuation effect is stronger for longer maturities. As opposed to longer maturities,
shorter maturities tend to produce similar quantitative and qualitative dynamics to those
obtained by the standard BGG case because the price effect vanishes. Our results show
that the BGG approach can be modified by market-based debt. However, the average
maturity crucially affects the dynamics.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Fragestellung
Obwohl der von Bernanke et al. (1999) (folgend BGG genannt) vorgeschlagene Finanz-
akzelerator-Ansatz allgemein Kredite ohne Marktpreis betrachtet, wird der Ansatz häu-
fig genutzt, um empirische Modellierungen zu motivieren, in denen Renditen von Un-
ternehmensanleihen herangezogen werden. Daher erscheint es angebracht zu untersuchen,
unter welchen Bedingungen Kredite mit Marktpreis direkt in den BGG-Ansatz integriert
werden können.
Beitrag
Wir modifizieren den ursprünglichen BGG-Ansatz um Kredite, die am Markt gehandelt
werden und einen Marktpreis aufweisen (Schuldverschreibungen). Ferner führen wir eine
durchschnittliche Laufzeitstruktur in das Modell ein. Das modifizierte BGG-Modell wird
dann in ein neukeynesianisches Modell eingebettet, um die Auswirkungen dieser Modi-
fikationen auf makroökonomische und finanzielle Größen in einem gesamtwirtschaftlichen
Rahmen zu betrachten.
Ergebnisse
Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die aus dem BGG-Ansatz bekannten Verstärkungstenden-
zen durch die Verwendung von Krediten mit Marktpreis abgemildert werden, d.h. der
Akzelerator abgeschwächt wird. Unerwartet schwankende Marktpreise beeinflussen das
Nettovermögen und somit den Verschuldungsgrad. Höhere Preise als Folge eines Schocks
erhöhen den Verschuldungsgrad und damit die externe Finanzierungsprämie. Dieser Ef-
fekt wirkt umso stärker, je länger die Laufzeit des Marktportfolios ist. Kürzere Laufzeiten
tendieren dazu, ähnliche Dynamiken zu erzeugen wie der ursprüngliche BGG-Ansatz, da
der Preiseffekt an Bedeutung verliert. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass der BGG-Ansatz
unter bestimmten Bedingungen um Marktkredite modifiziert werden kann, wobei Laufzeit-
struktureffekte eine bedeutende Rolle spielen.

The Financial Accelerator and Market-Based Debt
Instruments: A Role for Maturities?

Abstract
This paper shows how the average maturity of corporate bonds can affect the trans-
mission of shocks if financial frictions prevail. We modify a standard financial accel-
erator model à la Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999) and allow for market-based
debt which has a market-determined price. Our results show that the average ma-
turity of bonds is essential for the transmission of shocks. The dynamics are largely
identical to the standard BGG model for shorter maturities, while the model be-
haves differently for longer maturities. In this case a prolongation channel becomes
apparent which attenuates the original amplification mechanism.

1 Introduction
The financial accelerator introduced by Bernanke et al. (1999) (hereinafter BGG) has come
to be a widely used approach in recent macro-finance models to describe financial frictions
between the financial and the non-financial sector (Christiano, Trabandt, and Walentin,
2011; Carrilloa and Poilly, 2013; Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno, 2014). Christiano
et al. (2014) have recently argued, with the help of an estimated New Keynesian dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium (DNK) model with BGG-type financial frictions, that risk
shocks are very important sources of variations in the business cycle. Although empirical
work that is motivated by the BGG model draws its attention to yields of corporate
bonds (see De Pace and Weber (2013); Mizen and Tsoukas (2012); Gilchrist, Yankov, and
Zakrajsek (2009)), in most of the theoretical models with BGG-type frictions the debt
instrument is seen as a loan without a market-determined price. The aim of the paper is
to incorporate market-based debt into the BGG framework.
Generally, it turns out that corporate bond spreads convey relevant information for
future economic activity that is particularly related to financial health (Mody and Taylor,
2004; Gilchrist et al., 2009; Gilchrist and Zakrajsek, 2012). Consequently, the risk premia
of financially constrained non-financial firms seems to react more sensitively to shocks
than those of more unconstrained firms (Mizen and Tsoukas, 2012). However, recent
work can also show that the countercyclical relationship between spreads and economic
activity broke down for high-yield bonds during the financial crisis (De Pace and Weber,
2013). From this point of view, it is worthwhile to model bond spreads directly in the BGG
framework instead of credit spreads, as is usually done. Market-based debt is generally
characterized by market prices. Not only does the trajectory of market prices determine
returns, but market prices also affect the repayment capacity if securities are not repaid at
par value. How prices of market debt affect the economy when financial frictions prevail
is of economic importance because some authors claim that credit spreads, as measured
by bond spreads, have a non-trivial role for monetary policy (Cúrdia and Woodford, 2010;
Teranishi, 2012).
In this paper, we modifiy the financial accelerator model by introducing market-based
debt instruments, i.e. we allow the debt to have a market-determined price. In this
regard, bonds' maturity structure plays an important role. We argue that the introduction
of security prices in the BGG framework is important because the average maturity of
corporate bonds affects the transmission of shocks due to price effects. Our results show
that the BGG approach can be modified by market-based debt. However, the average
maturity crucially affects the dynamics. Including maturities into a dynamic general
equilibrium model is highly important because most contracts last one period in theory but
clearly longer in reality. Maturity transformation in banks has been recently investigated
by Andreasen, Ferman, and Zabczyk (2013) in a real business cycle model. We propose
a different approach by relying on a well-known New Keynesian framework.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss the modification of the BGG
approach by including market-based debt instruments. Section 3 provides the dynamic
general equilibrium framework in which the financial accelerator is embedded. Before we
investigate the dynamics of the models in Section 5, we present the calibration in Section
4. Section 6 concludes.

2 The Agency Problem
2.1 The Financial Accelerator Approach
We follow Bernanke et al. (1999), who rely on Townsend (1979), and posit a costly
state verification problem between financial intermediaries and non-financial firms.1 Non-
financial firms realize idiosyncratic shocks that affect the repayment capacity of their
external funds. We assume that non-financial firms acquire physical capital which is
exposed to these idiosyncratic shocks. The signals are private to non-financial firms.
However, financial intermediaries can get knowledge of the signals by spending resources,
i.e. incurring monitoring costs. In cases where the idiosyncratic shock is not sufficient to
generate enough returns for the non-financial firm to cover all of its debt, it has to give
all remaining assets to the intermediaries, which makes the contract incentive-compatible.
Because of asymmetric information in conjunction with monitoring costs, non-financial
firms combine net worth with debt to purchase physical capital.
In the BGG setting, funds are intermediated between non-financial firms (entrepreneurs)
and financial intermediaries with the help of mutual funds (Christiano et al., 2014; Chris-
tiano and Ikeda, 2013). The mutual funds obtain financial resources from households
and redistribute them to the entrepreneurs. Each financial contract is immanently risky,
but through diversification the risk can be eliminated completely. As a result of diver-
sification, the mutual funds can guarantee their ability to pay the risk-free rate to their
creditors while the entrepreneurs have to pay the external finance premium in addition to
the risk-free rate to compensate the mutal funds for expenses related to monitoring. The
resulting external finance premium varies positively with entrepreneurs' leverage ratio.
Typically, the financial contract is seen as a debt instrument that has a constant price
of unity. We modify the BGG setting in this respect, i.e. we allow for a debt instrument
with a price that changes over time, i.e. we treat bonds. Thus, the balance sheet constraint
of the entrepreneurs becomes
QB

Bm,t+1
= QK

, (1)
where QB

is the real price of the bond, Bm,t+1
is the quantity of bonds the m-th en-
trepreneur demands, QK
t
is the price of capital, Km,t+1
the capital stock each m-th
entrepreneur holds and NWm,t+1
is the net worth of each m-th entrepreneur. The in-
troduction of the real bond price QB
t
makes this model different from the standard BGG
model, in which QB
t
is equal to one.
By introducing the bond price and the risky (gross) bond rate Zt+1
we modify the
condition that determines the threshold m,t+1
for the productivity process, below which
bankruptcies occur, given the value of capital held and given the return on capital RK

In Eqs. (1) and (2) the initial consequences of the introduction of the price become clear.

mediaries, namely banks, and their creditors (see, for example, Gertler and Kiyotaki, 2010; Gertler and
Karadi, 2011). As argued by Christiano et al. (2014), both approaches are closely linked.

bonds, and the contractual bond rate, an increase in bond prices raises the productivity
threshold for defaults and lowers entrepreneurial net worth.
Following the standard BGG approach, the entrepreneur's expected earnings can be
expressed as the difference between the earnings on the projects given all realizations of
the productivity exceeding the threshold value and the costs of the credit raised for the
non-default cases

The function F (m,t+1
) in Eq. (3) represents the cumulative density function for realiza-
tions of m,t+1
. Thus, its value given one specific realization of m,t+1
is the probability
of default. In the case of a default, i.e. where the productivity variable falls short of the
threshold, the entrepreneurs surrender all remaining assets to the financial intermediary.

tions: the first-order condition of the contract (Eq. (5)) and the budget constraint of the

Because of the arguments outlined above, the mutual funds issue a representative bond
to the households. The bond that is at the center of the modification is assumed to have
a fixed payoff (i0
) every period that is one determinant of the bond return rB
t
. We provide
more details in the next subsection.

2.2 Introducing maturities
Since the maturity of bonds is generally longer than one period in reality, we need to
deal with an (average) maturity structure. Woodford (2001) proposes a simple way to
take account of average maturities that deviate from one period. He assumes that every
period a fraction of bonds matures (1 - ) , whereas the remaining fraction  is repaid
in later periods (we call  the maturity parameter in the following).2 Chen, Cúrdia, and
Ferrero (2012) choose a similar approach to account for maturity considerations. In line
with both contributions we assume that each entrepreneur issues corporate bonds with
a specific maturity every period.3 Consequently, the right-hand side of Eq. (2) is the
aggregate and comprises a continuum of bonds with corresponding prices. We need to
modify this equation with the definition QB
t
Bm,t+1
= 
s=0
QB
t|t-s
Bm,t-s+1
, where QB
t|t-s
is the price of a bond in period t issued s periods ago, which gives us

Km,t+1

Bm,t-s+1
. (7)
Furthermore, we assume that every series s of each non-financial firm m defaults to the
same extent if the non-financial firm cannot satisfy all its obligations.4 Under these cir-
cumstances it is easy to show that the price of a series depends on the current bond
price and the maturity parameter  Qt|s
= sQt
from which it follows that the aggre-
gate quantity of bonds Bm,t
is the sum of all series weighted by the maturity parameter
(Bt
= 
s=0
sBm,t-s
).5
By introducing maturities we are faced with the problem of choosing a proper defi-
nition of the bond return because of the economic interpretation related to it. We can
fundamentally distinguish between holdings until maturity and period holdings. If bonds
have a maturity of more than one period the definition of (expected) returns becomes
relevant because it is related to the investment strategy.6 From investors' perspective the
expected return over the entire period is relevant for the first case, while it is the expected
period return for the latter. Since holdings until maturity are less relevant for financial
intermediaries in reality we take the period perspective.7 Given that no arbitrage holds,
the (nominal) period return rB
t
for a (composite) bond, that carries a coupon, accordingly
arises as
2This can be thought of as a reinvestment.
3For the sake of simplicity, we assume that entrepreneurs issue bonds so that the average maturity
remains the same, i.e. their issuance policy is to control the average maturity. Otherwise we need to
think about the reasons why entrepreneurs have different issuance policies.
4This is a conventional assumption which is usually covered by enforced law. However, specific series
can be affected by default in reality while it is not the case in our model.
5Derivations can be found in Chen et al. (2012).
6Note that the model will be calibrated to reflect quarterly data. If bonds have a maturity of one
quarter, a distinction will not be necessary.
7Following the International Financial Reporting Standards (IRFS 13) a fair value measurement
can be used to determine the book value of financial assets in firm's balance sheet which is close to
market prices. This approach can be applied to both assets and liabilities. The US Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (US GAAP) contain similar guidelines.

Woodford (2001) assumes that bond prices result from an "exogenously specified deter-
ministic" process. In that case the perfect-foresight solution does not deviate much from
the solution for small stochastic changes. Based upon Woodford (2001), Chen et al. (2012)
opt for another formulation of the return and draw on the yield-to-maturity. Hence, it is
possible to proxy for different maturities by varying the term  in Eq. (8) (see Woodford,
2001). Again, s states that a fraction of the bonds is paid s + 1 periods after they are
issued. For  = 1 the bonds become consols and for  = 0 they are one-period bonds.
2.3 Integrating maturities in the BGG framework
In the following we show what changes if we include bonds with a specific (average) ma-
turity into the BGG framework. In order to prevent households from having to bear the
costs of defaulting, mutual funds were introduced, which hold a fully diversified portfo-
lio (Christiano et al., 2014). Households transfer their savings consequently to mutual
funds which intermediate them to the entrepreneurs. As mentioned, mutual funds hold a
portfolio of entrepreneurial bonds and issue risk-free bonds which are bought by house-
holds. This leads to the mutual funds' portfolio

dm, which must
be refinanced. An overview of this setting is given in Fig. 1.
Figure 1: Financial Sector in the modified BGG model
For the sake of simplicity, we assume that financial intermediaries do not conduct term
transformation which means that the average maturity of corporate bonds is identical to
the average maturity of the bonds financial intermediaries issue.8 It follows that mutual
funds issue bonds every time they plan to buy bonds from entrepreneurs. In order to match

funds have no incentive to exploit term transformation.

The risky bond return, as given in Eq. (2), can be rewritten so that we define the risky

where rpt+1
is the finance premium in real terms and reflects compensation for risk.
In order to back out the determinants of the compensation for risk, we can re-write
Eq. (6) with the help of Eq. (2) and the definition Zt

to obtain

=

f (t+1

. (11)
As can be seen in Eq. (11) the risky bond rate depends on the risk-free return, the
productivity threshold and intermediaries' net earnings after monitoring costs they have
to bear as a consequence of entrepreneurs' defaults. With the use of the definitions for the
returns and the participation constraint (Eq. (4)) we can solve for the risk compensation
to get

What is easy to see is that an increase in the productivity threshold causes the risky bond
rate to go up via the risk compensation because it is more difficult for the entrepreneurs
to repay their debt contractually and the intermediary requests compensation due to
increased monitoring costs. A rise in the current bond price contributes to a fall in
the risky bond rate. The reason might be that an increased bond price reflects a fall
in the risk-free rate which reduces borrowing costs. However, a rise in expected bond
prices stimulates the compensation for risk. The economic interpretation is related to the

ever, we do not want to stress the problem of maturity mismatches.

introduction of market-based debt. The formulation implicitly assumes that the remaining
fraction is repaid at expected market price (for reinvestment). In the logic of the model,
an increase in the expected bond price raises the value of debt that must be repaid in the
future. Given the productivity threshold and the corresponding probability of default,
this also means that the investor will lose more money with higher future prices. Hence,
the investor wants compensation for this risk. In this case, the reinvestment risk is not
negligible and a prolongation risk arises. Consequently, an unexpected rise in bond prices
causes entrepreneurial net worth to drop because debt must be repaid at higher market
prices. This introduces a new channel how maturity structures matter. It becomes clear
that price changes are important determinants in the modification of the BGG approach.
Furthermore, we can get more insight into the relations among the risky and the risk-
free bond. By making use of the definition for the risky bond rate, we can also express
the finance premium in terms of bond prices

It should be noted that the prices of both bonds differ due to risk considerations. By
combining Eq. (8) with the former, we can state a relationship between the price of
corporate bonds and mutual funds' bonds.

As becomes clear, the price of the entrepreneurial bond is automatically linked to the mu-
tual funds' bond price and to the riskiness of entrepreneurs. Since mutual funds do not
know a priori the riskiness of the entrepreneurs, i.e. the realization of m,t
, but only have
knowledge about its distribution, they would charge every entrepreneurial bond issuance
with the same risk premium. However, leverage ratio might differ across entrepreneurs
which would basically affect the individual risk premium and would make aggregation
more difficult. For this reason, we assume that there is a kind of perfect insurance that
equates leverage ratios by transfering net worth across the entrepreneurs before the fi-
nancial contract is signed.10 Thus, risk premia do not vary across the continuum of
entrepreneurs and, therefore, the price of corporate bonds across entrepreneurs either.
It becomes clear that the BGG approach is suitable to introduce traded bonds with the
help of several assumptions and the equations from Subsection 2.1 still hold, however, an
important role for maturities is introduced.
In order to evaluate the effects of maturities in the dynamic general equilibrium con-
text, we embed the BGG framework into a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium (DSGE) model in the fashion of Smets and Wouters (2003) or Christiano,
10This insurance can be seen similarly as the insurance mechanism introduced by Erceg, Henderson,
and Levin (2000) with respect to the labor market which equates differences in labor income ex post.
However, it is not required that a formal agency preserves the transfers of resources. One can imagine
that entrepreneurs with higher leverage ratios might be acquired by entrepreneurs with lower leverage
ratios. Market forces would then equate leverage ratios.

3 Financial frictions in a New Keynesian model
We introduce a standard BGG approach into a standard DNK model à la Smets and
Wouters (2003) that is modified to allow for market-based debt which has a price. Hence,
there are intermediate goods producers that produce differentiated goods to be sold in
a market with monopolistic competition. Through Calvo pricing we introduce stickiness
in prices. Non-optimizing firms follow a price indexation as a mixture of steady-state
inflation and past inflation. The intermediate goods are bundled following a Dixit-Stiglitz
aggregation technology to become final goods. Intermediate goods are produced with the
help of capital and labor. Following Erceg et al. (2000) nominal wages are also sticky. The
stock of capital can only be adjusted by paying adjustment costs; however, the utilization
of capital is allowed to vary, which is associated with costs. After physical capital is
produced, it is handed over to entrepreneurs.
3.1 Households
There exists a continuum of households where every l-th household, with l  (0, 1),
decides on its consumption (Cl,t
), its labor supply (Nl,t
), and the allocation of its wealth
derived from a utility maximization problem. The preferences of the households can be
characterized by

In Eq. (14) the parameter  is the discount factor,  controls the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution, and  reflects the inverse Frisch elasticity. Since households show external
habit formation, the parameter h is the habit parameter. The term  is for scaling
purposes. The household can invest in two financial assets: government bonds BG

. Regarding the former, households earn the risk-free
rate while they receive the risk-free bond return for holdings of the latter. Government
bonds are in zero net supply. Since households are the owners of intermediate goods
firms, the monopolistic profits are paid out as dividends (Dt
). Every household has to
pay lump-sum taxes (Tt
). Besides the returns stemming from their wealth, households
receive income from their labor supply.
Concerning the labor supply we follow Erceg et al. (2000) and assume that households
supply their differentiated labor to a labor union which demands differentiated labor from
all households and bundle this heterogenous labor supply to produce a homogenous labor
composite (Eq. (15)).

Intermediate goods producers demand the homogenous labor bundle for use in production.
Because of monopolistic power in the labor market, households can set wages. In Eq.
8
(15) the term w controls the substitution among differentiated labor. The labor union
minimizes the costs for producing the labor bundle by taking the individual wage rates as
given. Following this optimization problem, the demand for each individual unit of labor
results as

which is the price intermediate goods firms have to pay for a unit of the labor composite.
Similarly to Calvo pricing in goods markets, households cannot reoptimize their wage
every period. Reoptimization is only possible with a probability of 1-w which they take
into account in their optimization problem. Thus, households maximize labor income by
choosing the optimal wage rate and by taking the disutility of labor and the demand for
their labor as given.

In Eq. (18) the variable l,t

Since wages and labor supply can fundamentally differ across all households, we as-
sume that a state-contingent insurance exists that equates income across households.

3.2 Final goods firms
In a continuum of intermediate goods producing fims each i-th firm produces the i-th
differentiated good. All intermediate goods firms operate in a market with monopolistic
competition. The final goods sector is characterized by a representitive producer, due to
perfect competition, who purchases the intermediate goods and combines them with the
9

)
Yt

, (20)
where the parameter  reflects the market power and determines the price markup. The
final goods producing firm maximizes profits by taking the prices of the intermediate
goods as well as the price of the final goods as given and by choosing the amount of both
intermediate goods they demand and the amount of final goods they supply. As a result
the demand function for intermediate goods results as
Yi,t

Pi,t
Pt

where Pit
is the price of the i-th intermediate good and Pt
the price of the final good.

duction function with constant returns to scale and fixed costs

where the term  is the share of capital in production and At
represents the technology.
In order to produce a unit of the intermediate good, the firms need physical capital (Ki,t
),
they rent from the entrepreneurs, and homogeneous labor (Ni,t
). In a first step, inter-
mediate goods firms minimize their costs by choosing the inputs given their production
technology. Since intermediate goods firms have market power, they are able to set the
price optimally. However, frictions prevail, which means that setting optimal prices can
only be realized with a probability of 1 - . In cases where intermediate goods firms can-
not choose the optimal price, they adjust prices following an indexation rule (¯
t
) which is
a weighted average of last period's inflation (t-1
) and the steady-state rate of inflation

3.4 Capital producers
The economy is populated by capital producers which are owned by households and work
in a market of perfect competition, which is why all capital producers are identical. After
production has taken place in period t capital producers purchase undepreciated physical
capital (1 - ) Kt
from entrepreneurs at price QK
t
in order to combine it with newly
produced investment goods (It
) to obtain the new stock of physical capital ( ¯
Kt+1
) for
use in the next period. Because of attrition, a fraction of the stock of physical capital
depreciates at a constant rate  every period. The installation of new physical capital by
using investment goods entails costs  It

is given by  It

that satisfies the conditions  (1) =  (1) = 0 and

After capital producers have constructed the new stock of physical capital, they sell it to

profits by choosing the amount of newly produced investment goods. For convenience,
investment goods have the same price as physical capital.

3.5 Entrepreneurs
The economy is populated by a continuum of entrepreneurs. Each m-th entrepreneur with
m  (0, 1) buys a specific amount of physical capital from capital producers and rents
it out to intermediate goods producers. After having purchased the amount of physical
capital at the end of period t and before renting it out during the period t+1, entrepreneurs
process the stock of capital they now own at the beginning of period t+1 and subsequently
choose its utilization rate in the following. Entrepreneurial skills are subject to random
shocks, which are independently distributed across entrepreneurs and periods following a
log normal distribution with a mean of unity. These shocks affect entrepreneurs' individual
productivity m,t+1
which determines the effective stock of capital the m-th entrepreneur
can work with
Km,t+1
= m,t+1
¯
Km,t+1
. (24)
Before this capital is supplied to intermediate goods producers, entrepreneurs can
vary the capital utilization rate ut+1
so that the utilized stock of capital for the m-th
entrepreneur becomes
Km,t+1
= um,t+1
Km,t+1
. (25)
Variations in the capital utilization rate are linked to costs , which take the form
(um,t
) =
rk
k
(exp k (um,t
- 1) - 1). (26)
11
In Eq. (26) the term rk represents the rental costs of capital (in the steady state) and
k is a scaling parameter. After the utilization rate has been chosen, entrepreneurs rent
the capital to intermediate goods producers and receive the rental rate on capital rk
t
per units of utilized capital. As already explained above, after production has occurred,
entrepreneurs sell the undepreciated capital back at price QK
t+1
. Hence, the return on
capital for each m-th entrepreneur results as
1 + Rk,

(27)
Because of asymmetric information between the entrepreneurs and their creditors (see
Subsection 2.1), the entrepreneurs cannot solely rely on external finance and buy physical
capital (at price QK
t
) with a combination of own resources (net worth NWm,t
) and external
funds. External funds can be obtained by issuing corporate bonds (Bm,t
) at bond price
QB
t
. Loosely speaking, net worth results as an outcome of entrepreneurial activity. The
sale of physical capital back to capital producers after intermediate goods producers give
rented capital back to entrepreneurs, together with corresponding rental income, generate
earnings. From these earnings entrepreneurs satisfy their liabilities stemming from the
issuance of external debt. The remainder constitutes net worth. Thus, external finance
is determined by the desired purchases of physical capital and existing net worth.

The decision problem of entrepreneurs consists of two problems that can be understood
as undertaken in two branches. While entrepreneurial profits are maximized by choosing
the threshold productivity and the amount of effective capital in the first branch, utilized
capital is found by minimizing utilization costs by choosing the amount of capital. While
the second problem is straightforward, the first one is already explained in Subsection
2.1. The law of motion for net worth is the only missing equation. In order to prevent
entrepreneurs from accumulating net worth indefinitely, which would obviate the need to
raise external finance, we follow Bernanke et al. (1999) and assume that entrepreneurs
exit with a specific probability of . The total number of entrepreneurs remains constant
because new entrepreneurs enter who receive a transfer from their households to start
business which is a fraction  of total assets. Again, the same insurance mechanism that
equates leverage ratios across entrepreneurs also controls the average maturity of old and
new entrepreneurs by redistributing resources. Consequently, aggregate entrepreneurial
net worth evolves from net earnings (for all non-default cases), i.e. the difference between
returns on entrepreneurial projects and the costs for external finance plus the transfer
from households.

bank conducts interest rate smoothing with the autoregressive parameter smooth. The

Markets clear by equating the corresponding demand and supply. In the resource con-

4 Calibration
As usual, we calibrate our model on a quarterly frequency. The parameters for the
calibration predominantly stem from Smets and Wouters (2007) and Christiano et al.
(2014). The latter have recently estimated a model with BGG-type frictions for US data.
Obviously, our model then reflects the structure of the USA. All calibrated parameters
can be found in Table 1.
For the curvature of the utility function with respect to consumption we set a value
of 1.4. Similarly, the inverse Frisch elasticity becomes 1.9. Both values are from Smets
and Wouters (2007). The parameter for habit formation in consumption is equal to 0.7
(Smets and Wouters, 2007; Christiano et al., 2014). The Calvo parameters for prices and
wages are set at 0.74 and 0.81, respectively, which are the estimated values in Christiano
et al. (2014). The weights on lagged inflation in the indexation rules for prices and wages
are taken from the same source and become 0.1 and 0.51, respectively, in our model. We
also allow for a steady-state rate of inflation that is set to 2.4 per cent annually, which
reflects the US experience. The parameter in the cost function for variations in capital
utilization becomes 2.54 (Christiano et al., 2014) and the corresponding parameter for
investment adjustment costs is 5.5 (Smets and Wouters, 2007). The discount factor is set
at 0.9987 based on Christiano et al. (2014), what induces the nominal risk-free rate to
be 2.92 per cent and the real risk-free rate to be 0.52 per cent on an annual basis. The
depreciation rate of capital is calibrated to the conventional value of 0.025. Labor is set
at 0.33.
Regarding the parameters in the Taylor rule, we set the responsiveness to inflation
to 2.4 and to output growth to 0.36. The smoothing parameter becomes 0.85. Our
parameters for the BGG part corresponds to the estimated values of Christiano et al.
(2014). The share of resources lost for monitoring purposes takes the conventional value
of 0.21. Similarly, the variance of the idiosyncratic productivity process becomes 0.26.

5 Analyzing the dynamics
5.1 General evaluation of the modified BGG model
In this subsection we discuss the overall performance of the BGG model modified by
market-based debt. We contrast its overall dynamic with those of the standard BGG
model and the standard New Keynesian model (standard NK).11 The underlying two
shocks are standard in DNK models (monetary policy shock and productivity shock).
In the following figures the modified BGG model is given by the bold black lines, the
standard BGG model by the blue dashed lines, and the standard NK model by the red
lines with dots. For the modification of the BGG model we set the maturity parameter
 to 1, which means that the bond is a consol, similar to the formulation in Woodford
(2001).
The dynamics resulting from a monetary policy shock for output, consumption, in-
vestments, inflation, hours worked, real wages, entrepreneurial net worth, the finance pre-
mium, and the bond price can be found in Fig. 2. Following the two first-order conditions
related to the BGG approach, the finance premium is defined as 1 + Rk
t+1
/ 1 + Et
rB
t+1
.
As can be seen, the qualitative dynamics regarding the macroeconomic variables are
mostly similar across the three models. However, qualitative differences emerge through
the modification of the standard BGG model with respect to net worth and the finance
11In the standard NK model all financial frictions are switched off.

premium. The introduction of market-based debt with a long maturity structure atten-
uates the responses of investments and output compared to the standard BGG and the
standard NK model. This development is mostly due to the different behavior of the
aforementioned two variables. Concretely, the responses of bond prices are the driving
force behind and mainly responsible for the differences. By introducing maturities, it is
assumed that debt is repaid at the end of every period at the prevailing market price.
Since the price drops following the monetary policy shock, it is easier for the entrepreneur
to service a given quantity of bonds. Because of this effect net worth shrinks less com-
pared to the standard BGG case. As a result, the leverage ratio decreases which reduces
the external finance premium. This is in clear contrast to the standard BGG model in
which the finance premium rises. The attenuation of the drop in investments, following
the monetary policy shock, stems from the improvement in this part of entrepreneurs'
financing conditions. In the case of a very long maturitiy structure, the amplification
mechanism of shocks with respect to output and investments, introduced with the help
of financial frictions, is even reversed through our modifications. However, consumption
decreases by more in the modified model because inflation falls by less which implies a
higher trajectory for the risk-free rate.
For the productivity shock, the dynamics of which are shown in Fig. 3, the situation
is quite similar. After the productivity shock, the demand for physical capital rises and,
as a consequence, its price, which increases entrepreneurs' net worth. Nevertheless, the
finance premium slightly increases because of the Fisherian effect (see Christiano, Motto,

Figure 3: Comparison of Models - Productivity Shock
and Rostagno (2010)). The Fisherian effect stems from the fact that financial contracts
are written in nominal terms so that real net worth is also affected by the rate of inflation.
As Christiano et al. (2010) show for a transitory productivity shock, which is identical
to our productivity shock, the Fisherian effect is mainly responsible for the attenuation
of the responses compared to the standard NK model by introducing financial frictions.
In the modified model, bond prices also increase which induce the entrepreneurs to have
an unexpected higher debt service in the next period with a given quantity of bonds.
This effect additionally dampens the increase in net worth in the modified model. The
resulting rise in the leverage ratio stimulates the upward pressure in the finance premium
and dampens the improvement in investments compared to the standard BGG model.
Thus, the introduction of market-based debt with a long maturity structure reinforces the
attenuation effects on investments and output resulting from the standard BGG model in
the case of the productivity shock.
Summing up the results, the introduction of market-based debt into the standard
BGG model attenuates its accelerating mechanism. Changes in bond prices affect net
worth which feed back into entrepreneurs' leverage ratio and consequently into the finance
premium. In the next section, we discuss the impact of maturities on the dynamics.
16
5.2 Consequences of different maturities
Fig. 4 shows the effects on output, investments, inflation, the finance premium, the bond
price, and net worth following an unexpected monetary policy shock (first column), a
productivity shock (second column), and a shock on the riskiness of entrepreneurs (last
column). The last shock is typical to understand stress in the financial sector (Christiano
et al., 2014). For all three shocks we compare the dynamics of the modified BGG model
for three different average maturities. In the first case, the bold black line represents a
consol, i.e.  = 1. The second case comes close to the average maturity in the USA and
is given by the dashed red line. The avarage maturity in the USA from 2000 until the
emergence of the financial crisis for bonds of non-financial corporations is slightly more
than 6 years.12 This value can be achieved by setting  to value of 0.97, which corresponds
to an average maturity of slightly less than 6 years.13 The cyan-colored line with dots
reflects an average maturity structure of one period (one quarter), i.e.  = 0. In addition,
we provide the dynamics of the standard BGG model as a benchmark, which is given by
the blue dashed dotted lines.

As becomes clear, the case for shorter maturities coincides largely with the standard

BGG case. An unexpected monetary policy shock increases the risk-free rate, which
reduces consumption and output. This is the reason why the demand for capital shrinks.
The downward pressure on capital prices contracts entrepreneurs' net worth and boosts
the finance premium, which makes investments even more expensive. In the case of
a longer average maturity, the rise in the risk-free rate depresses the bond price more
strongly.14 The reason for the stronger fall in bond prices is that fewer bonds are repaid
every period, which means that the price must fall more sharply to achieve the same
return. Falling bond prices now reduce the finance premium so much that it falls below
its steady-state value. Since in the model outstanding debt is repaid at market prices
every period and the remaining funds are reinvested, lower bond prices ease the debt
burden and foster net worth. Investments decrease less than in the standard BGG case,
which stabilizes the price of capital and as a consequence entrepreneurs' net worth as well.
Inflation also falls less than in the two other cases. From this point of view longer average
maturities, as modelled, mitigate the accelerating mechanism following an unexpected
monetary policy shock.
The attenuation effect also becomes stronger for longer maturities in the case of the
productivity shock. A rise in the aggregate productivity raises the demand for cap-
ital. Thus, investment starts to grow and the price of capital rises. Consequently, en-
trepreneurs' net worth increases, which tends to lower the finance premium. Since inflation
is reduced as a result of sunk marginal costs the risk-free rate is lowered in accordance
with the monetary policy rule. In the case of a longer average maturity this drop in the
risk-free rate initiates a strong rise in the price for bonds. As a result the finance premium
widens. Thus, less capital is built up and entrepreneurs' net worth is even depressed.
Unlike the previous two cases, there are nearly no quantitative and qualitative effects
following a risk shock resulting from the average maturity on the dynamics except the
bond price. The reason is that the risk shock dominates the behavior of the external
finance premium.
5.3 Impact of frictions
In order to see how sensitive the propagation mechanism reacts on the severity of finan-
cial frictions following the introduction of market-based debt, we vary the share µf that
controls the monitoring costs. An increase in the share can be interpreted as an intensi-
fication of the financial frictions. To present the pure effects stemming from the increase
in monitoring costs related to the market price effect, we take the difference between the
responses from the modified model and the responses from the standard BGG model. The
maturity parameter is set to reflect the US experience. In Fig. 5, the x-axis presents the
periods following a shock while the y-axis provides the different values for the monitoring
costs. The z-axis gives then the differences in responses between the models, as described,
of selected variables for each combination. We draw on the finance premium, net worth
and output for the three already treated shocks. Responses on the monetary shock can
be found in the first row, on the productivity shock in the middle row and on the risk
shock in the third row.
As can be seen the maturity effect, i.e. the attenuation, becomes stronger for more
14Note that the magnitude of the original shock, and therefore the trajectory of the interest rate, are
nearly identical across the cases.

intensified financial frictions. Compared to the standard BGG model net worth raises
more and causes the finance premium to drop by more if financial frictions are intensified.
As a consequence the fall in output is strongly attenuated for higher degrees of financial
frictions. A similar result is also true for the productivity shock. The increase in net worth
is sharply dampened which results in a stronger rise in the finance premium. Consequently,
the rise in output is attenuated. Even in the case of the risk shock, an attenuation effect
arises for higher degrees of financial frictions. Net worth decreases by less which mitigates
the increase in the finance premium. The reason for these results can be seen in Eq. (12).
In the standard BGG case the risk finance premium depends on the risk-free rate while
it depends in the modified model on the risk-free bond return which is determined by the
bond price. Bond prices react more strongly following the inital shock for more intensified
financial frictions so that they affect net worth to a greater extent.

6 Conclusion
We modified the standard BGG model embedded in a medium-sized DNK model to allow
for market-based debt instruments that have a price. Our results show that, compared to
the standard BGG framework, countervailing effects can occur due to the price component
in debt instruments. This result crucially depends on the average maturity of the bond
portfolio. By introducing bond prices, it is assumed that debt must be repaid at market
prices every period. Price changes will then contribute positively to the finance premium
because the ability to service the debt is affected. The use of the period return leads to
different dynamics, particularly when the average maturity of the bonds is long, because
more debt must be prolonged every period. As opposed to longer maturities, shorter
maturities tend to produce similar quantitative and qualitative dynamics to those obtained
by the standard BGG case because the price effect vanishes. Nevertheless, we take the
perspective of the investor in our model which means that the investor does not hold
bonds until maturity by drawing on the formulation in Woodford (2001). Related to this
fact the channel for entrepreneurs results. It would be of interest to take the perspective
of the entrepreneurs which requires a further modification of the model.
In a broader sense, our results could explain why the financial accelerator, captured
by the link between credit spreads and economic activity, seems to have broken down in
the USA (De Pace and Weber, 2013). If a prolongation risk becomes apparent, it could
already affect current yield spreads. This might be particularly relevant in an economic
recovery while the financial sector is still under stress. In cases where maturities matter,
our results correspond to the findings of Andreasen et al. (2013). As opposed to them,
however, we do not draw on maturity transformation, but it would be interesting to extend
our model in this respect.
