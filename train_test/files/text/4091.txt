Introduction
Relative to negative emotion functioning, the regulation of
positive feelings is an understudied area. Here we report
the construction and initial validation in the general popu-
lation of the Inventory of Responses to Positive Affective
States (IRPAS), a trait self-report instrument intended to
complement existing measures of response to positive
emotion by extending measurement to a broad class of
responses to positive states including, but not limited to,
strategies that up- or down-regulate mood across a range of
different positive mood states. We discuss the rationale for
such an extension below.
"Emotion regulation" can be defined as a set of processes
that individuals engage in either consciously or non-
consciously, and with or without deliberate effort (Gross &
Thompson, 2007), that have the intention or effect of increas-
ing, decreasing, or maintaining emotional state. Gross (1998)
proposes five stages at which regulation processes may occur:
situation selection, situation modification, attentional deploy-
ment, cognitive change, and response modification. The
IRPAS is most closely concerned with the final stage, response
modification. Processes at this stage emerge once the emotion
has been elicited, and represent experiential, behavioral, or
physiological attempts to modulate the emotional response.
It has been proposed that while some individuals tend to
engage in strategies that maintain or increase positive mood
(savoring: Bryant, 1989, 2003), others tend to engage in
strategies that suppress or reduce it (dampening: Wood,
Hiempel, & Michela, 2003). The study of positive mood up-
regulation strategies has revealed a number of subtypes
(Bryant & Veroff, 2007; Livingstone & Srivastava, 2012;
Quoidbach, Berry, Hansenne, & Mikolajczak, 2010), includ-
ing behavioral display (expressing emotion), being present
(directing attention toward current experience), capitalizing
(communicating and celebrating the event with others), posi-
tive mental time travel (dwelling on positive emotional
memories), engagement (savoring and socializing), better-
ment (pursuing goals, personal growth), and indulgence
(substance use and fantasy). Other behaviors that often arise
during positive affect and could act as savoring responses
include gratitude and prosocial behaviors such as helping
others (Emmons & McCullough, 2003; Isen & Levin, 1972).
Yet behavioral response to positive mood may go beyond
the deployment of strategies that have the immediate func-
tion of changing or maintaining the emotional state. We may
use positive states as a platform from which to reach our
goals, for example, by capitalizing upon it and expressing
our feelings to others (Langston, 1994), or by using the
broader attentional perspective associated with a period of
happiness to engage with new opportunities that will

The Construction of an Inventory of
Responses to Positive Affective States
Kim Wright1 and Tamsin Armstrong1
Abstract
We report the construction of the Inventory of Responses to Positive Affective States (IRPAS), a trait, self-report measure
of response to positive affect. The IRPAS differs from existing measures by addressing a broad set of responses to positive
affect, including but not limited to affect regulation strategies, and by considering relevance to a range of positive affective
states. In Study 1, qualitative interviews were conducted with 21 individuals to inform item content. In Study 2, factor analysis
of the final item set was conducted using data from 540 individuals. Study 3 investigated convergent and divergent validity
and test­retest reliability of the resulting 59-item IRPAS. The IRPAS was found to be reliable and valid, and to make a unique
contribution to the literature on response to positive mood. Further validation studies should be conducted; potential
applications include exploration of positive affect functioning in both clinical and non-clinical populations.

promote future happiness (Fredrickson, 1998). Positive
mood has been found to "undo" the negative effects of
engagement in exercises which typically appear to deplete
motivational resources; hence, periods of positive mood may
represent times when one is best disposed to tackle the next
in a series of demanding tasks (Tice, Baumeister, Shmueli, &
Muraven, 2007). Finally, the findings of several studies sug-
gest that positive mood renders individuals more open to
tackling problems or areas of potential failure (e.g., Reed &
Aspinwall, 1998). Thus, individuals may show responses to
positive mood states that do not directly regulate the present
emotion, but instead channel the resources it imbues toward
some other purpose. Alternatively, individuals may display a
range of responses to the same positive state, some of which
are mood regulatory while others are self- or goal regulatory
(and some that overlap in terms of function); these may well
complement one another and occur in sequence, in parallel,
or in alternation. Therefore, rather than focusing only upon
behaviors that serve to directly change state, the IRPAS con-
siders the broader category of behaviors that occur in
response to positive states, and may not represent deliberate
regulatory attempts. In this way, it differs from the most
closely related existing instruments. The Ways of Savoring
Checklist (WOSC; Bryant & Veroff, 2007) explores a variety
of savoring and dampening responses, and as such is con-
cerned primarily with behaviors that increase or decrease
positive affect. Similarly, the Emotion Regulation Profile­
Revised (ERP-R: Nélis, Quoidbach, Hansenne, &
Mikolajczak, 2011), the Positive Events and Responses
Survey (PEARS; Gentzler, Palmer, & Ramsey, 2015), the
Responses to Positive Affect (RPA; Feldman, Joormann, &
Johnson, 2008) scale, and the Inventory of Positive Emotion
Regulation Strategies (IPERS: Livingstone & Srivastava,
2012) specifically measure responses that down- and/or up-
regulate positive emotions. Finally, the Savoring Beliefs
Inventory (Bryant, 2003) measures perceived ability to
derive pleasure from past, current, and future positive events.
We argue that up- or down-regulation strategies are a subset
of the broader class of behaviors that occur in response to
positive affect, and thus to assess these responses more gen-
erally, a more comprehensive instrument would be needed.
Our intention is that the IRPAS should overlap conceptually
with these instruments (in terms of measuring behaviors gen-
erally thought to up- or down-regulate positive mood), but
should also measure categories of response not currently
addressed, informed by both theories of positive emotion
function and empirical data from qualitative research into
positive emotion experience.
Correspondingly, Study 1 describes the findings of quali-
tative interviews with members of the general population,
conducted with the aim of supplementing the existing litera-
ture on types of responses to positive mood. We adopted this
inductive approach in recognition of the limitations of rely-
ing purely upon existing theory to inform the details of our
questionnaire items, particularly given that we intend the
scale to address responses beyond those typically considered
within savoring and dampening frameworks. Little theoreti-
cal or empirical guidance is available as to the forms that
these types of responses might take; hence, the need for an
exploratory approach (for a discussion of the place of induc-
tive research, see Spector, Roselberg, Ryan, Schmitt, &
Zedeck, 2014). The validity of the types of responses puta-
tively measured by the IRPAS, and of the distinctions drawn
between them, is then investigated in Studies 2 and 3.
A second unique aspect of the IRPAS is that we took into
account, deliberately and explicitly, a range of positive emo-
tional states during item development. Discrete emotion
accounts propose that positive emotions fall into categories
representing their particular functions in terms of self-regu-
lation and social interaction (Shiota, Keltner, & John, 2006).
Correspondingly, particular positive states would be expected
to prompt particular types of cognitive and behavioral
responses. For example, desire has been found to promote a
more narrow attentional focus than does amusement (Gable
& Harmon-Jones, 2008). Also concerned with the function
of positive emotion, the self-regulation model proposed by
Carver and Scheier (1998) views certain positive emotions
as indicators of the extent to which our progress toward a
goal corresponds to an ideal rate of progress. Thus, emotions
such as enthusiasm act as signals to maintain or increase
striving toward a goal, whereas satisfaction or contentment
signals us to reduce or cease striving toward that goal. Hence,
the notion that positive emotions have a function leads to the
prediction that different positive states will vary in terms of
the typical profile of response associated with them. While
the responses measured by existing instruments may well
apply to a range of positive emotions, to ensure that the
IRPAS is relevant to more than one positive state we deliber-
ately draw upon theory and data concerning response pro-
files to multiple positive states. Specifically, we use sets of
emotion words (labeled calm, happy, enthusiastic, and
active) corresponding to four locations in affective space on
the dimensional model of affect proposed by Russell (1980);
this allows investigation of a range of positive states without
requiring participants to respond separately with respect to
every possible positive emotion.
In summary, the IRPAS is designed to facilitate research
into positive emotion, whereby researchers are concerned with
what follows various positive mood states, in terms of behav-
ior. This may allow more nuanced investigation of some exist-
ing theories of positive affect functioning (such as "Broaden
and Build"; Fredrickson, 1998), which hypothesize a relation-
ship between positive mood and self- or goal regulation, and
may also give greater scope to delineate aspects of positive
emotion that are dysregulated in psychological disorders.
Study 1
To inform scale development, in Study 1 we conducted
semi-structured interviews with members of the general
Wright and Armstrong 3
public, asking participants to describe their responses to
four types of positive states.
Method
Participants, measures, and procedure.
The study was
approved by the appropriate departmental ethics review
board, and all participants gave written, informed consent.
Participants were 21 members of the general public,
recruited through a database of volunteers and via commu-
nity advertisement, with no financial remuneration for par-
ticipation. Participants were required to be aged 18 or above
and with sufficient competence in English to complete the
interview. The mean age of the sample was 60.30 (SD =
19.62, range = 20-87). Seventeen of 21 participants were
female. Interviews were conducted by a female interviewer
by telephone or in person, dictated by participant prefer-
ence. The semi-structured interview conducted was devel-
oped for the purpose of this study. Participants were asked
to consider four positive mood states in turn, selected to cor-
respond to four locations in affective space on the dimen-
sional model of affect proposed by Russell (1980). These
were characterized by high activation, moderate positive
valence (active, alert, stimulated, determined, or attentive:
"active"); high activation, high positive valence (enthusias-
tic, elated, excited, peppy, lively, or strong: "enthusiastic");
moderate activation, high positive valence (happy, pleased,
glad, satisfied, kindly, or warmhearted: "happy"); and low
activation, moderate positive valence (calm, at rest, placid,
relaxed, quiet, or serene: "calm").
For each state, participants were asked to identify and
describe a specific instance of experiencing that state, and
then to report what they did and thought once in that positive
mood. In particular, they were asked if their actions or
thoughts were different when in this state, whether there was
anything in particular they did not do or think when in this
state, and whether they did or thought anything to try to
increase, decrease, or maintain the state. Participants were
then asked these questions with reference to how they would
typically respond to that type of positive mood. The order in
which the four types of positive mood were asked about was
counterbalanced across participants. Participant responses
were recorded by the interviewer contemporaneously in
writing.
Analysis.
A framework analysis approach was applied
(Ritchie & Spencer, 1994). The first five transcripts were
independently coded by two raters, and an initial thematic
framework was agreed through a process of consensus and
conciliation (Phase 1). The remainder of the transcripts were
coded by Rater 1, and changes to the thematic framework
were noted (Phase 2). Rater 1 then recoded all interviews
using the new framework (Phase 3). The framework and
indexing were then checked by Rater 2, and a final frame-
work was agreed (Phase 4). The themes that emerged from
the analysis were then mapped to characterize the nature and
range of the concepts identified, the associations between
them, and their relationships with the literature (Phase 5).
Because an aim of Study 1 was to inform development of
multiple items for the IRPAS, subthemes were identified to
provide greater detail on the facets of each major theme.
Results
In Phase 1, seven major themes were identified. Two were
removed and three new themes added in Phase 2. Phase 4
resulted in removal of two, producing a final set of six broad
themes (Table 1); four of which comprised of two or more
distinct subthemes. Four subthemes broke down further to
give two or more minor subthemes (see supplementary mate-
rial for details of subthemes). Thematic saturation with
respect to the broad thematic framework (whereby analysis
of subsequent participants did not result in addition of new
themes) was achieved by Transcript 7.
Channeling describes responses which capitalize upon
the present positive state and channel the associated motiva-
tion, optimism, or energy toward either achieving existing
goals or developing new ones. A number of participants
reported that on some occasions of positive mood, they con-
tinue with what they have planned, regardless of their mood
state: We termed this response style Mood Independence.
Borrowing from the existing literature on this topic, we used
the term savoring to refer to responses whereby participants
actively participated in or enjoyed the mood state, but did not
seek to influence it.
In contrast, mood management describes strategies used
with the stated or apparent intention to influence mood state.
Alteration of activation was achieved by altering physiology
(e.g., by taking stimulants), engaging in particular thoughts
or activities, or selecting particular environments, and this
response style appeared in relation to both high and low acti-
vation positive states. Participants also described engaging in
responses likely to influence the level of pleasantness they
were experiencing. Some responses involved approaching
pleasant thoughts, activities, or environments, while others
involved avoiding unpleasant thoughts, activities, or envi-
ronments. Responses used with the stated or apparent inten-
tion of dampening mood, or of monitoring mood state with a
view to keeping it under control, were categorized under the
subtheme of dampening/monitoring.
A number of participants described engaging in reflec-
tion/reappraisal, such that they reframed the situation or
their life, thought in depth about the self or the world, or
analyzed the cause of their mood. The final major theme
identified, connectedness, describes those responses that
appeared to strengthen or reestablish the individual's con-
nection with a larger entity. Many participants described
connecting with others by sharing emotion, interacting, or by
helping others. A small number of participants described
reaffirming their connection with more abstract or higher
4 SAGE Open
constructs such as nature, religion or spiritual matters, and
culture or beauty. The third subtheme we identified within
the connectedness theme concerned gratitude, which had
overlapped with the social and higher connectedness sub-
themes but also included non-specific thoughts of gratitude.
Discussion
We identified six broad themes and associated subthemes.
Represented in these subthemes were a number of responses
to positive states previously described in the literature, par-
ticularly within the context of the Broaden and Build theory
(Fredrickson, 1998) and the literature on savoring (Bryant,
1989, 2003). According to the Broaden and Build theory,
positive states allow individuals to temporarily expand their
thought­action repertoire, for example, by engaging in
exploratory behaviors or by savoring and integrating current
experience: These tendencies are reflected in the channeling,
savoring, and reflection/reappraisal themes, respectively. In
addition to the savoring theme itself, the reflection/reap-
praisal and connectedness themes could be seen as reflecting
aspects of savoring that accord with a broad definition of the
construct, as could the pleasantness subtheme of mood man-
agement. In our analysis, we differentiated savoring from
responses that appeared to be better described as seeking
connection with others and with higher entities.
Despite overall congruence with previous influential
accounts of response to positive mood, the mood indepen-
dence and altering activation themes identified here do not
sit comfortably within these frameworks. In the latter case,
this may be because in addition to asking participants to
reflect upon high valence states (enthusiastic and happy) we
asked them to reflect on states of both very high ("active")
and very low ("calm") activation, thus increasing the likeli-
hood that participants would report strategies concerned with
the management of activation levels. In addition, the estab-
lished concepts of Broaden and Build and Savoring focus
upon specific types of responses to positive states. Therefore,
it would be expected that the current analysis, which seeks to
capture a range of commonly occurring RPA, should identify
additional themes.
Study 2
The aim of Study 2 was to construct a reliable measure of
response to positive mood, the items within which were
drawn from the thematic categories identified in Study 1.
Method
Item development. Items were generated on the basis of the
themes and subthemes identified. Where possible, para-
phrased quotations from individual transcripts were used to
construct items. Sufficient items were generated to allow a
minimum set of four for each theme or subtheme or minor
subtheme, to give a total of 105, of which 22 were reversed
items.
A 4-point fully anchored Likert-type scale was presented
with each item, where 1 = almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 =
often, 4 = almost always. Participants were given the follow-
ing instructions:
The questions that follow ask about how you tend to respond
when you are in a positive mood. Before you answer them,
please bring to mind particular times when you were in a positive

words best describe exactly how you felt during these times.
Please tick as many sets of words as describes how you felt. If

to think and act in each of the ways listed below at times like
these when you feel good. It's important that you tell us about
how you think and act once you are in a positive mood, rather
than what puts you in a good mood in the first place. Also, we
would like you to tell us how you actually think and act, rather
than how you believe you ought to.
Participants.
Participants were 540 individuals recruited
from the general population and the undergraduate student
population of the host institution. A total of 456 participants
(84%) were recruited via two Internet-based sites that pro-
vide opportunities for volunteers to complete research stud-
ies online. In addition, 84 participants (16%) were students
who were given the opportunity to participate in the study in
one of two face-to-face testing sessions in exchange for
course credit. The mean age of participants was 22.52 years
(SD = 10.95, range = 18-74), and 116 (22%) were male.
Details of nationality were provided by 256 participants: Of
these 202 (79%) were North American, 24 (9%) were Asian,
53 (21%) were European, 5 (2%) were African, 20 (8%)
were Central or South American, and 12 (5%) were Austra-
lian. English was the first language of 420 (92%) of the 456
who provided data on this.
Measures and procedure.The study was approved by the
appropriate departmental ethics review board. After giving
informed consent, participants completed the state version of
the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson,
Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), a commonly used self-report mea-
sure of current mood state that assesses current levels of posi-
tive and negative affect separately. Participants also completed
the Hypomanic Personality Questionnaire (Eckblad & Chap-
man, 1986): Findings pertaining to this measure are not
reported here. Finally, participants completed the IRPAS.
Results
For the sample as a whole, mean PANAS Positive Affect
subscale was 28.23 (SD = 8.18), whereas mean Negative
Affect subscale score was 16.96 (SD = 6.65). These scores
are within the range that would be expected from a non-
clinical population (Watson et al., 1988).
Data were subjected to exploratory factor analysis using
the principal axis factoring method. An oblique rotation
(direct oblim, Ð = 0) was used as it was predicted that some
of the constructs would be correlated. There were 24 factors
with eigenvalues greater than 1, accounting for 64.36% of
the variance. Application of Cattell's (1966) criterion to the
scree plot of eigenvalues indicated that extraction of 12 or 13
factors would be appropriate. Parallel analysis based on 500
factor analyses of automatically generated random datasets
revealed 12 factors with eigenvalues greater than the 95th
percentile of eigenvalues produced from the random datas-
ets. Therefore, a 12-factor solution was adopted.
To generate subscales for the IRPAS while reducing the
total number of items in the scale from 105, we retained only
items that had both high factor loadings (0.4 or above) and
resulted in a decrease of the subscale alpha value when
deleted. In addition, those items loading substantially on
more than one factor were eliminated, giving a maximum of
seven items per subscale and a minimum of 3 (one factor
contained only two items that loaded substantially upon it
and was therefore not included as a subscale). The resulting
scale comprised 11 subscales and 59 items. Table 2 displays
the retained items constituting each subscale, with details of
the subscale title, factor loadings, alpha value, mean (SD),
minimum and maximum for each subscale. While some sub-
scale titles were drawn directly from Study 1, in some cases,
it was necessary to generate new titles to best capture the
subscale content. In general, internal consistency values for
the subscales were found to be adequate, with lower values
potentially reflecting the small number of items in some sub-
scales.1 For all subscales, participant scores were distributed
along the full range of possible scores. Scores were left
skewed for two subscales (Dampening and Stimulating)
reflecting a tendency for participants to endorse lower rates
of these responses; however, standard deviations of scores on
these subscales were comparable with those obtained for
subscales with the same number of items.
Bivariate correlational analyses were used to explore
the relationships between the 11 subscales. Details of these
correlations are given in Table 3. In general, the subscales
showed low to moderate positive correlations with one
another, with the exception of the Dampening subscale
which showed some negative correlations with other sub-
scales, and the Stimulating subscale which showed low
correlations with the majority of subscales other than
Dampening, with which it was moderately positively
correlated.
Relationship between subscale scores and other variables.A
small positive correlation was found between age and Grati-
tude score, r = .11, p = .011. Small negative correlations
were found between age and Savoring, r = -.12, p = .006,
Activating, r = -.23, p < .001, and Avoiding, r = -.20, p <
.001, scores.
Current level of positive affect was found to have small
to moderate positive correlations with all subscales other
than Dampening and Stimulating, correlations with which
were negligible (see Table 3). Current level of negative
affect was found to have small positive correlations with

Note. Subscale scores are the mean of scores on each constituent item. For all subscales, min = 1, max = 4 other than Dampening where max = 3.43.
None of the final item sets are reverse-scored. Brief definitions of subscales are as follows: Gratitude: giving thanks for one's situation; Dampening:
behaviors likely to decrease positive affect; Stimulating: ingestion of substances likely to increase physiological arousal; Higher Connectedness: relating
oneself to greater abstract entities; Channeling: directing effort toward achieving goals; Helping: caring for or cooperating with others; Analyzing: thinking
about the causes, meanings, and consequences of current mood; Savoring: enjoying the present moment; Activating: engaging in physical activity; Avoiding:
avoiding potential triggers of negative mood; Calming: engaging in behaviors likely to decrease activation.

Relationship between subscale scores and referenced mood
state. Of the whole sample, 212 (39.3%) endorsed only one
of the four positive mood types, 135 (25%) endorsed two
mood types, 101 (18.7%) endorsed three mood types, and 62
(11.5%) endorsed four mood types, while 29 (5.4%) did not
endorse any mood states. Overall, 181 (33.5%) described
their mood as calm at the time(s) they were thinking of when
completing the IRPAS, 358 (66.3%) described their mood as
happy, 281 (52%) described their mood as enthusiastic, and
213 (39.4%) described their mood as active.
Data from the 212 participants endorsing only one mood
state were used to explore associations between referenced
mood state and IRPAS subscale scores. Four MANOVA
models were constructed, with the 11 subscales of the IRPAS
as dependent variables, and presence of calm, happy,
enthusiastic, or active mood state (yes/no) as the independent
variable. A conservative alpha value of .01 was applied to
reduce the likelihood of Type 1 errors due to multiple testing.
The overall model was significant for active mood only,
F(11, 183) = 2.87, Wilk's  = .98, p = .002. Within this,
those referencing active mood reported greater levels of
higher connectedness and channeling than those who refer-
enced other states, Higher Connectedness: active absent M =
2.33, SD = 0.57, active present M = 2.55, SD = 0.62;
Channeling: active absent M = 2.58, SD = 0.55, active pres-
ent M = 2.76, SD = 0.57.
Correspondence between factor structure and thematic frame-
work.All themes identified in Study 1 were represented
separately within the factor structure revealed in Study 2,
with the exception of "Mood Independence," items from
which were subsumed under "Channeling." We considered
the only underrepresented subthematic area to be two minor
subthemes within the "connectedness--social" subtheme,
namely "sharing emotion" and "communication,
8 SAGE Open
interaction, closeness." Correspondence between findings
from Studies 1 and 2 is given within supplementary
material.
Discussion
Factor analysis of items derived from the findings of Study
1 resulted in a 59-item scale containing 11 subscales, with
adequate internal consistency. Scores on the resulting sub-
scales spanned the full range of each subscale, and standard
deviations were broadly comparable across subscales of
equivalent item number, supporting the potential of the
subscales to capture variability between respondents in
their response styles. Scores on the Dampening and
Stimulating subscales were left skewed, indicating that for
many participants, these response styles do not reflect their
typical behavior, but that these scales may capture response
patterns that characterize a minority. Scores on the majority
of subscales were found to be associated with current mood
state; however, because of the cross-sectional nature of this
study, it would be premature to conclude that current mood
state biases responses on the IRPAS.
Consistent with existing measures of response to positive
mood, the IRPAS asked participants to report their typical
responses to episodes of (general) positive mood. To charac-
terize the states that participants were referencing when they
completed the item set, we asked them to endorse any of
four positive states. Each of the four states was endorsed by
at least some of the participants, supporting the IRPAS as a
measure developed from data applicable to a broad range of
positive states. When individuals endorsing only one state
were compared with one another in terms of their scores on
the IRPAS subscales, only active mood was found to be
associated with a distinct response profile, suggesting that
active positive mood in particular may lead to specific
behavioral responses less common in other positive mood
states, and potentially with different implications for subse-
quent affect. However, this comparison was limited by the
inclusion of only a subset of the whole sample and its non-
randomized design, whereby referenced mood state is likely
to be confounded with individual differences. To explore
definitively the relationship between referenced mood state
and response profile, future studies might randomize indi-
viduals to call to mind one of a number of positive states
while completing the measure.
Study 3
Test­retest reliability and convergent and divergent valid-
ity of the IRPAS were investigated among two further
samples. In terms of assessing the validity of the IRPAS,
we selected the three measures most closely related to the
IRPAS conceptually, namely the Response to Positive
Affect (RPA; Feldman et al., 2008) scale, the positive emo-
tion regulation subscales of the ERP-R (Nélis et al., 2011)
and the WOSC (Bryant & Veroff, 2007). Predictions
regarding convergent validity were made on the basis of
conceptual overlap between particular WOSC, RPA, ERP-
R, and IRPAS subscales, where conceptually equivalent
subscales existed across measures.
Because the three existing scales focus broadly upon
savoring and dampening strategies, we sought to explore
overlap between these existing subscales and the most
closely related subscales of the IRPAS. In addition, the
IRPAS includes a "gratitude" subscale which is also present
as a specific savoring subscale within the WOSC. Thus in
terms of convergent validity, significant positive correlations
were predicted between (1) IRPAS savoring and the closest
equivalent subscales assessing savoring in the other mea-
sures, namely WOSC absorption, RPA emotion focus, RPA
self-focus, ERP-R savoring total score; (2) IRPAS gratitude
and its equivalent, WOSC blessings; (3) IRPAS dampening
and the closest equivalent subscales in the other measures,
namely WOSC killjoy thinking, RPA dampening, ERP-R
dampening total score.
The following prediction was made regarding diver-
gent validity. It centers upon divergence between the
IRPAS Dampening subscale and the Savoring (or non-
Dampening) subscales of the WOSC, RPA, and ERP-R
because the former is the only IRPAS subscale to attempt
to measure responses likely to decrease mood valence,
therefore should not be positively correlated with sub-
scales measuring responses that up-regulate positive
mood. (4) IRPAS Dampening will have negligible or neg-
ative correlations with WOSC, RPA, and ERP-R subscales
other than WOSC killjoy thinking, RPA dampening, and
ERP-R dampening total. Finally, given that the IRPAS is
designed to encompass savoring and dampening strategies
but not to be limited to these, and should also encompass
strategies relevant to a range of positive states, it was pre-
dicted that (5) the IRPAS would appear to make a novel
contribution to the measurement of positive emotion, evi-
denced by at least some of its subscales (excluding those
already mentioned in predictions 1-4) having low to neg-
ligible correlations with all WOSC, RPA, and ERP-R
subscales.
Method
Participants. For both studies, samples of more than 84 were
required to detect a moderate effect size (R = .3) with  = .05
and power = .80. Participants in the first sample were 102
students who gave written informed consent to participate in
the study as part of a practical class and in exchange for
course credit. The mean age of participants was 20.23 (SD =
5.26) and 20 (20%) were male. Participants in the second
sample were 116 students who gave written informed con-
sent to participate in the study as part of a practical class. The
mean age of participants was 19.14 (SD = 3.04) and 19 (17%)
were male.

Measures
WOSC. The WOSC (Bryant & Veroff, 2007) is a 60-item
self-report questionnaire, whereby participants indicate
on a 7-point scale to what extent each item describes how
they typically respond to positive mood. The WOSC con-
tains 10 subscales: Sharing With Others, Memory Building,
Self-Congratulation, Comparing, Sensory-Perceptual Sharp-
ening, Absorption, Behavioral Expression, Temporal Aware-
ness, Counting Blessings, and Killjoy Thinking.
RPA scale.The RPA (Feldman et al., 2008) is a 17-item
self-report measure developed to assess levels of ruminative
and dampening RPA, with items rated on a 4-point scale of
typical response frequency. It contains three subscales: Self-
Focused Positive Rumination (rumination on self and person-
ally relevant goals), Emotion-Focused Positive Rumination
(rumination on mood and somatic experiences), and Damp-
ening (thoughts likely to dampen positive mood). It has been
found to show acceptable levels of internal consistency, and
it predicted patterns of associations with depressive rumina-
tion, self-esteem, and depressive and manic symptoms.
ERP-R. The ERP-R (Nélis et al., 2011) is a vignette-based
self-report measure in which respondents must select one of
eight reactions which would best reflect their response, for
each of 15 scenarios, each depicting a different emotional
experience (including both positive and negative emotions).
Scores can be computed for both up- and down-regulation of
both positive and negative emotions. In the current study, we
considered the positive emotion regulation subscales. Up-
regulation subscales include Behavioral Display (express-
ing positive feelings non-verbally), Savoring the Present
Moment (directing awareness to current experience), capi-
talizing (communicating and sharing positive events with
others), and Positive Mental Time Travel (remembering or
anticipating positive events). Down-regulation subscales
include Inhibition of Emotion Expression (suppressing posi-
tive emotions), Inattention (attending to activities other than
the positive event), Fault-Finding (attending to the negatives
of the event), and Negative Mental Time Travel (remember-
ing negative aspects of the event or anticipating negative
consequences connected with it). Evidence of divergent and
convergent validity has been found for the ERP-R in rela-
tion to verbal skills and non-verbal reasoning, and emotional
intelligence, respectively.
The IRPAS, described previously, was also included.
Procedure.The study was approved by the appropriate
departmental ethics review board. Sample 1 completed the
IRPAS at Time 1. At Time 2, which took place 1 month later,
they completed the IRPAS and the WOSC, with the order of
presentation being randomized across participants. Sample 2
completed the IRPAS, RPA, and ERP-R at one time point,
with the order of administration being randomized across
participants.
Results
Sample 1. To estimate test­retest reliability within Sample 1,
the intraclass correlation coefficient (single rating value)
scores for the 11 IRPAS subscales were calculated for Times
1 and 2, using a two-way random-effects model. This resulted
in estimates of reliability ranging from .59 to .87 (see Table 2).
Nine of the subscales showed "substantial" test­retest agree-
ment; one showed "almost perfect" agreement, with only one
(Analyzing) showing "moderate" agreement (Landis & Koch,
1977). Correlational analyses were conducted to explore rela-
tionships between subscales of the IRPAS and the WOSC
(Table 4; both as measured at Time 2). Correlation coefficients
ranged from R = -.31 to R = .64. A total of 17 correlation coef-
ficients (15%) were of at least moderate strength (R  .30). To
test predictions concerning convergent validity, a conservative
alpha level of p < .01 was applied. As predicted, IRPAS savor-
ing was significantly positively correlated with WOSC absorp-
tion, IRPAS gratitude was significantly positively correlated
with WOSC blessings, and IRPAS dampening was signifi-
cantly positively correlated with WOSC killjoy thinking. To
test the prediction concerning divergent validity, an alpha
level of p < .05 was applied (the conservative approach being
to maximize the likelihood of finding a significant associa-
tion). Consistent with Prediction 4, IRPAS dampening was not
significantly positively correlated with any WOSC subscale
other than those predicted.
Sample 2. Correlational analyses were conducted to explore
relationships between subscales of the IRPAS and the RPA
and ERP-R (Table 4). Correlation coefficients ranged from
R = -.31 to R = .54. A total of 10 correlation coefficients (7%)
were of at least moderate strength (R  .30). As predicted,
IRPAS savoring was significantly positively correlated with
RPA emotion focus, RPA self-focus, and ERP-R savoring
total. Also as predicted, IRPAS dampening was significantly
positively correlated with RPA dampening and ERP-R damp-
ening total. It was also significantly positively correlated with
one of the ERP-R subscales contributing to dampening total
score, Fault-Finding. Consistent with Prediction 4, IRPAS
dampening was not significantly positively correlated with
any RPA or ERP-R subscales other than those predicted.
To address the question of whether the IRPAS makes a
novel contribution to the measurement of response to posi-
tive emotion (Prediction 5), we identified IRPAS subscales
that did not correlate with other WOSC, RPA, or ERP-R sub-
scales at least moderately (R < .30) in all cases. Three IRPAS
subscales did not have such relationships with other sub-
scales: Stimulating, Avoiding, and Calming.
Discussion
Examination of test­retest reliability for the IRPAS revealed
this to be acceptable over a period of 1 month. Overall, the
IRPAS was not highly correlated with any of the existing
10 SAGE Open
measures, but a minority of relationships between scales
were of at least moderate strength: This is to be expected,
given that each measures a different but overlapping set of
constructs.
Supportive of the convergent validity of the IRPAS scale,
its subscales showed the expected pattern of associations
with subscales of the three other measures. Supportive of the
divergent validity of the IRPAS, the Dampening subscale
was positively associated only with subscales from the other
measures addressing dampening.
While these findings are encouraging, this study is limited
asacomprehensiveassessmentofIRPASvalidity.Conceptual
overlap between the IRPAS and the three existing measures
used is not complete; therefore, we did not have a standard
against which to assess some of the more novel subscales of
the IRPAS. Second, while the measures we assessed the
IRPAS against are used in contemporary research, none of
these have been exhaustively validated. Therefore, we were
not able to access a "gold standard" against which to validate
our novel measure. Third, given that RPA may not occur in
isolation from one another, convergence between pairs of
subscales may reflect behaviors that tend to occur together,
rather than behaviors that are same in form and function.
Fourth, although the ERP-R did differ methodologically
from the IRPAS, all measures utilized self-report: Further
research should seek to validate the IRPAS against behav-
ioral measures of response to positive mood. Finally, our
sample was composed of University students, of whom the
majority were young adults, despite items having been gen-
erated from a study conducted with an older sample. Validity
in older, non-student samples requires investigation.
Importantly, it appears that the IRPAS measures some con-
structs not addressed by the WOSC: Three IRPAS subscales
showed low to negligible correlations with all WOSC, RPA,
and ERP-R subscales. This may reflect two intentional dif-
ferences between the IRPAS and the other three scales. First,
the latter scales are intended as more in-depth measures of
responses that up- or down-regulate positive mood, whereas
the IRPAS is intended to include responses that may not have
a direct regulatory effect. Second, the content of the IRPAS
is informed by individuals'reports of response to a variety of
positive mood states and may therefore capture strategies,
such as "calming," that may not be relevant to the affective
states referred to by existing measures. Thus, the measures

General Discussion
Items in the IRPAS were constructed on the basis of findings
from interviews with members of the general public, com-
bined with concepts from the extant literature. The resulting
set of subscales were found to have adequate internal consis-
tency and test­retest reliability, and to show the expected
pattern of associations with subscales of existing measures
of similar constructs.
The IRPAS appears to measure some constructs not
addressed by the other measures investigated, suggesting
that it has the potential to make a novel contribution to the
investigation of the regulation of positive emotion. Study 3
demonstrates empirical divergence between the Calming,
Stimulating, and Avoiding subscales and those of the
WOSC, RPA, and ERP-R; they also diverge theoretically, in
that Stimulating and Calming appear to reflect responses
likely to follow increases in activation in particular, whereas
the measures investigated are largely concerned with man-
agement of the valence rather than the arousal dimension of
positive mood. This may rest in part upon the approach
taken in the development of the IRPAS, whereby items were
designed to capture responses to a range of different positive
states, including high and low activation positive states. On
this basis, we would predict that scores on these IRPAS sub-
scales would not correlate strongly with the scores on the
subscales of a recent instrument, the PEARS (Gentzler
et al., 2015), which measures aspects of savoring and damp-
ening. Theoretical divergence of the IRPAS from these
instruments is also present with regard to the concept of
"Channeling," whereby individuals do not engage in behav-
iors that function to up- or down-regulate positive mood but
instead use this mood as an opportunity to achieve goals,
and "analyzing" whereby the individual seeks to understand
the causes, meanings, and consequences of his or her mood.
It may be that these constructs are captured within the
"Betterment" subscale of the IPERS (Livingstone &
Srivastava, 2012). The IPERS also contains a subscale
(Indulgence) that makes reference to substance use and as
such may overlap empirically with the Stimulating subscale.
Future research should explore the relationship between the
IRPAS, IPERS, and PEARS.
Although the IRPAS was designed to capture a range of
responses to positive mood, it cannot be considered to be
comprehensive. Nevertheless, in Study 1, thematic satura-
tion was reached by Participant 7 of 21, suggesting that, in
this sample at least, response repertoire was relatively gener-
alizable across individuals, supporting the wider applicabil-
ity of this framework. In terms of its applicability to different
types of positive emotions, we assessed states located at four
locations on a dimensional model of affect. Future studies
could explore whether the IRPAS appears to reflect typical
responses to discrete emotions such as awe, amusement, and
compassion. While the IRPAS is intended as a trait measure,
albeit concerning state-based responding, the current study
revealed correlations between participants'current mood and
IRPAS responses. As such, further research is needed to
characterize the extent to which the IRPAS reflects trait ver-
sus state-related behavioral tendencies.
The IRPAS was developed based on data from primarily
female samples. Given that men and women may differ in
the use of some emotion regulation strategies (Gross &
John, 2003), we cannot exclude the possibility that, during
item development, we failed to discover constructs that are
of unique relevance to male individuals due to our sample
characteristics. Validation of the IRPAS was conducted in
samples of (primarily) young adults in University educa-
tion; therefore, further research is needed to estimate its
properties in older, non-student populations. This may also
allow investigation of developmental trajectories of both
positive affect experience and response profiles, something
that was not taken into account in the thematic analysis
within the current study. Furthermore, response to and dis-
plays of positive emotion are likely to be influenced signifi-
cantly by social and cultural background and context. While
the limited data we obtained indicate that the sample of indi-
viduals in our factor analytic study was fairly diverse in
terms of nationality, this information was neither complete
nor reliable enough to permit examination of differences in
response to positive emotion in relation to cultural or social
factors. Future work should aim both to characterize partici-
pants in terms of these factors and to investigate the validity
of the IRPAS cross-culturally.
Further exploration of the validity of the IRPAS should
include tests of predictive validity, for example, correlating
subscale scores with behavior post laboratory positive mood
induction or during real-life instances of positive mood via
experience sampling studies. Examples of dependent vari-
ables include tendency to invest energy in goals and chal-
lenges ("channeling") and tendency to opt to help others
("helping"). Tests of predictive validity could also include
investigating the extent to which IRPAS scores predict or are
predicted by presence of psychological disorders or difficul-
ties, based on theoretical understandings of positive affect
regulation in these conditions. For example, individuals with
bipolar disorder would be expected to show higher rates of
behaviors that increase activation levels once in a positive
mood, such as activating, and that involve the pursuit of
goals, such as channeling (see Mansell & Lam, 2006).
The IRPAS deliberately does not discriminate between
behaviors that arise as an intrinsic part of the emotional
response (such as approaching goals when enthusiastic) and
those that represent attempts to regulate affect: We consider
this necessary to look beyond behavioral responses that are
concerned only with modifying affect directly. Furthermore,
such an approach allows for between- and within-individual
variation in the function of these behaviors. Nevertheless,
12 SAGE Open
future development of the IRPAS might seek to test its prop-
erties as a measure of either intrinsic response or regulatory
attempts by, for example, asking the same individuals to
complete two versions of the measure, differing only in
whether they ask respondents to focus upon naturally arising
or deliberate responses.
In terms of its potential applications, the IRPAS may con-
tribute to research into theories of positive affect response. For
example, Fredrickson's (1998) Broaden and Build model sug-
gests that we may use positive states as a platform from which
to reach our goals, thus creating further positive mood. The
IRPAS provides a means of exploring the behaviors that facili-
tate this, within one measure (and potentially in combination
with others). In particular, the Channeling subscale could be
used to explore "building" via goal-focused behavior when in
positive mood, while the Helping subscale (and Social
Expressive subscales in other measures) might reflect strate-
gies for building social capital. In contrast, one might predict
that an avoidant response style to positive mood (as measured
by the novelAvoiding subscale) may allow less opportunity for
the individual to build external and relational resources, and
thus be associated with less positive outcomes over the medium
to long term. As previously mentioned, dysregulation of posi-
tive emotion regulation processes may contribute to some psy-
chological disorders. Studies in this area to date have tended to
use measures that focus on particular response styles to positive
states, such as savoring and rumination (e.g., Johnson,
McKenzie, & McMurrich, 2008), and in doing so have revealed
differences between clinical and non-clinical samples. The
IRPAS allows exploration of the specificity of these effects as
it can investigate which of a range of response styles are altered.
In doing so, it could contribute to a picture of the broader pro-
file of response to positive affect associated with a given disor-
der. In conclusion, we have described the development of a
novel measure of response to positive mood, which has poten-
tial to contribute to research into positive emotion regulation in
both clinical and non-clinical populations.

1. Factor structure and content remained unchanged follow-
ing factor analysis of the final item set with the exception of
"Stimulating," which split into two factors both containing
two items. Items in the first of these factors showed substantial
loadings on the second; therefore, the original Stimulating fac-
tor was retained. To investigate the extent to which the factor
structure is robust across subsamples, we repeated the analy-
ses, excluding the 84 participants who completed the study
face to face. The structure and content of factors was largely
replicated, with the exception of an additional factor originally
subsumed under "channeling."
