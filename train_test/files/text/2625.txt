Abstract
Prisoners have higher rates of chronic diseases such as substance dependence, mental
health conditions and infectious disease, as compared to the general population. We pro-
jected the number of male state prisoners with a chronic health condition who at release
would be eligible or ineligible for healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
We used ACA income guidelines in conjunction with reported pre-arrest social security ben-
efits and income from a nationally representative sample of prisoners to estimate the num-
ber eligible for healthcare coverage at release. There were 643,290 US male prisoners
aged 18­64 with a chronic health condition. At release, 73% in Medicaid-expansion states
would qualify for Medicaid or tax credits. In non-expansion states, 54% would qualify for tax
credits, but 22% (n = 69,827) had incomes of  100% the federal poverty limit and thus
would be ineligible for ACA-mediated healthcare coverage. These prisoners comprise 11%
of all male prisoners with a chronic condition. The ACA was projected to provide coverage
to most male state prisoners with a chronic health condition; however, roughly 70,000 fall in
the "coverage gap" and may require non-routine care at emergency departments. Mecha-
nisms are needed to secure coverage for this at risk group and address barriers to routine
utilization of health services.
Introduction
Prisoners have higher rates of chronic diseases such as substance dependence, mental health
conditions and infectious disease, as compared to the general population.[1­3] The most recent
national survey of prisoners (2011­2012) suggests that 50% of state and federal prisoners have
a chronic medical condition.[1] Though limited, existing research suggests that prior to 2014,
most released prisoners did not have health insurance in the 8­10 months after release. [4]
Reasons for this lack of insurance have not been well documented, but are likely related to lack
of employment (and employment-based insurance), limited perceived need among those who

ficulty enrolling in social safety net programs providing healthcare coverage. Lack of insurance
was particularly prevalent among released men,[4] who comprised 89% of all released prison-
ers in 2013.[5]
Healthcare coverage rates among released prisoners may be improving with the roll-out of
the Affordable Care Act (ACA).[6,7] The ACA provides several mechanisms to increase
healthcare coverage. Two primary mechanisms include tax credits to help middle-income per-
sons purchase private insurance through the state or federal "marketplaces" and the expansion
of Medicaid eligibility criteria. Whereas Medicaid traditionally served impoverished adults
who were aged, disabled, or had dependents, the ACA expanded criteria to provide coverage to
low-income adults regardless of disability or dependents.
In 2012 the US Supreme Court ruled that states were not bound to expand Medicaid under
the ACA.[8] In 2014, the first year of the ACA's prescribed Medicaid expansion, 27 states
expanded their eligibility criteria.[9] In these states, single adults (and families) with incomes
equal to 138% of federal poverty level (FPL) or less were eligible to enroll in Medicaid. ACA
subsidies for private insurance were available for those between 139% and 400% FPL. In non-
expansion states, subsidies were available to those 101%-400% FPL, but Medicaid was not
extended to those at 100% FPL ($11,290) or less, creating a "coverage gap."[10]
Prior to the Court's 2012 Medicaid ruling, Cuellar and Cheema projected that 57% of newly
released US state prisoners could gain coverage under the ACA,[11] but these estimates
assumed universal Medicaid expansion and did not account for enrollment in Medicare or
"traditional" Medicaid (for the aged, disabled or those with dependents) for which automatic
enrollment occurs in most states when qualifying for Social Security Administration (SSA)
benefits, e.g. "Disability."
We therefore undertook the current study, which accounts for the 2014 landscape of state
Medicaid expansion policies and SSA-mediated benefits, to project post-release healthcare cov-
erage rates--and the coverage gap--for male state prisoners with chronic health problems. We
specifically focused on this population because of its large size, and because these inmates
would likely require healthcare following release but have traditionally had low rates of health-
care coverage in the community.
Materials and Methods
Data source
Our analyses utilize data from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities,
which was conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on behalf of the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
[12] The survey was administered to a nationally representative sample of state prisoners using
face-to-face interviews and included items assessing prisoners' health conditions, pre-incarcer-
ation Social Security Administration (SSA) benefits, income, and other socio-demographic
characteristics. The data and codebook are available online (www.icpsr.umich.edu). We pro-
vide the main survey items utilized in our analyses in the S1 Appendix.
Study population
Our study population was composed of male state prisoners aged 18­64 years who reported a
history of at least one of the 18 chronic health conditions assessed in the survey: hypertension,
diabetes, heart disease, stroke, asthma, kidney disease, arthritis, hepatitis, cirrhosis, cancer,
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), paralysis, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, a psychotic disorder, or a personality disorder.

Primary Analysis
We described the socio-demographic characteristics and prevalence of reported chronic health
conditions among the study population. We then used the joint distributions of reported SSA
benefits, income, and health conditions to project the number of male prisoners with a chronic
condition who would be eligible for healthcare coverage at release. We estimated the number
with a history of SSA benefits in the month prior to incarceration and assumed that SSA-medi-
ated insurance could be resumed post-release. Among those without SSA benefits in the month
prior to incarceration, we determined eligibility for Medicaid and tax credits by comparing
prisoners' pre-incarceration annual income (i.e. projected from income the month prior to
incarceration, adjusted for inflation using the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost
Index[13]) to the 2014 Medicaid/tax credit FPL criteria described above. Sixteen percent were
missing income data. To impute missing income values, we jointly stratified prisoners by age
(group), race, and education level, and assigned those with missing incomes the median
income value of prisoners within their same stratum who had non-missing data. For all and
each chronic condition(s), we estimated the number of prisoners eligible for healthcare cover-
age in Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states. We applied the sampling weights
included in the dataset so that results would reflect the total population of adult, non-elderly
US male prisoners with a history of chronic medical condition. All analyses, including the sen-
sitivity analyses described below, were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (Cary, North Caro-
lina). Weighted population means and frequencies and corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were estimated using proc surveymeans and proc surveyfreq.
Sensitivity analyses
Reported income in the month prior to arrest was recorded using categorical responses (e.g.
No income, $1­199, $200­399. . . . $5000­7499, $7500 or more). In our main analysis, we
assume respondents' pre-incarceration monthly income was the mid-point value of the
selected range (e.g. inmates reporting an income of $1­199 were assigned an income of $100).
Projected income was estimated as the monthly income, multiplied by 12, and adjusted for
inflation to 2014 dollars. We conducted two sets of sensitivity analyses to determine the num-
ber of prisoners in the coverage gap by assuming that respondents' true income was at the low-
est and highest value of each selected category. Several studies suggest that prisoners may
encounter a loss of earning or "wage penalty" following an incarceration. In line with the earlier
analysis by Cuellar and Cheema, we examined the effect of a 15% "wage penalty," on our
results, which we applied to our "low,""mid-point" and "high" analyses resulting in six esti-
mates of the number of male state prisoners who would be within the coverage gap at release.
This study was deemed non-human subjects research by the Institutional Review Board of the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Results
There were 643,290 male prisoners aged 18­64 with a chronic health condition (Table 1).
Briefly, 60% were non-White, 11% were aged over 50 years, and 34% had neither completed
high school nor earned a high school equivalency certificate (GED). The median annual pre-
incarceration income, adjusted to 2014 dollars, was $18,531. Seven percent received SSA bene-
fits in the month prior to incarceration, and prisoners with any chronic condition were nearly
evenly distributed across expansion (51%) and non-expansion (49%) states (Table 1).
In Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states, 20% and 17% of prisoners, respectively,
were projected to earn 400% FPL and would thus not be eligible for Medicaid or tax credits,
and about 7% of prisoners in expansion and non-expansion states had a history of SSA

benefits, implying future Medicaid or Medicare coverage. In expansion states, 73% of prisoners
qualified for Medicaid or tax credits. In non-expansion states, 54% qualified for tax credits, but
22% (n = 69827) were projected to have incomes  100% FPL and would not qualify for any
support (Fig 1), placing them in the coverage gap.
Among the prisoners in the coverage gap, the ten most frequently reported conditions in
order of descending frequency were hypertension (n = 27245), depression, arthritis, asthma,
hepatitis, heart disease, bipolar, kidney disease, personality disorder, and anxiety disorder
(n = 7283) (Table 2).
In the primary analysis, prisoners in the coverage gap represented 11% of all prisoners in
our target population (and 22% of those in non-expansion states). Across sensitivity analyses,
which addressed uncertainty in prisoners' post-release income, the number of prisoners in the
coverage gap ranged from 51,254 (High income estimate, no wage penalty) to 103,128 (Low
income estimate, 15% wage penalty), suggesting that 16­32% of prisoners in non-expansion
states (Fig 2), and 8­16% of prisoners in our total population would be in the coverage gap.
Discussion
Although the ACA could have a substantial impact on access to healthcare for released prison-
ers, previously published estimates of the number of prisoners eligible for healthcare coverage
at release do not account for states that opted not to expand Medicaid. In this analysis, we
accounted for the 2014 landscape of Medicaid expansion policies and estimated healthcare cov-
erage eligibility under the ACA among male state prisoners with chronic health conditions. We
also refined the estimates by accounting for inmates eligible for coverage under SSA benefits.
Our primary analysis suggests that about sixty-nine thousand male prisoners with selected
chronic conditions would be ineligible for healthcare coverage under the ACA because of states
that chose not to expand their Medicaid coverage to impoverished adults without disability or
dependents. This population in the coverage gap represents 11% of all male prisoners aged 18­
64 with selected chronic conditions, and based on our sensitivity analysis, the gap would not be
expected to be lower than 8% or higher than 16%. In the national context, these results suggest
that through Medicaid expansion or tax credits, the ACA can provide insurance to the majority
of impoverished male prisoners with chronic health conditions in need of coverage.

Nevertheless, interventions are needed for the roughly 50,000 to 100,000 men in the cover-
age gap, most of whom are released from prison and returning to their home communities
after serving one or two years. Clearly universal Medicaid expansion could further improve
coverage rates, but Medicaid expansion remains politically contentious. In the absence of uni-
versal Medicaid expansion, an important point of access to healthcare coverage for those with
debilitating conditions is through SSA benefits (such as "disability"), which can result in Medi-
care or Medicaid enrollment. We found that among those with a chronic condition (in both
expansion and non-expansion states), only 7% had a history of SSA benefits in the month prior
to arrest. These percentages likely underestimate the true proportion of prisoners who could
qualify for SSA benefits if prisoners were evaluated thoroughly. The extent to which prison sys-
tems currently facilitate enrollment in SSA benefits (i.e., assist with applications) in preparation
for prisoners' release is unclear, but data from our 2011­2012 survey suggest that SSA enroll-
ment assistance was uncommon.[14]
Fig 2. Sensitivity analysis projecting the number and percentage of male US state prisoners with a history of chronic medical conditions
incarcerated in a Medicaid non-expansion state who will be in the "coverage gap"* at release. *In non-expansion states, subsidies are
available to those with incomes 101%-400% FPL, but Medicaid was not extended to those at or below 100% FPL, creating a "coverage gap" among
impoverished persons. **Respondents reported income by selecting one of several income categories (e.g. No income, $1­100, $200­400, etc.) for
the month prior to their incarceration. We estimated monthly income based on the lowest and highest value and their average (i.e. "Mid-point") in the
selected category. All monthly estimates were multiplied by 12 to estimate annual income and adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars. Estimates were
compared to 2014 ACA income guidelines to determine the percentage in the "coverage gap." ***Some evidence suggests that released prisoners
earn less than their pre-incarceration wages. As with an earlier study[11], we applied a 15% wage penalty to the Low, Middle, and High pre-
incarceration income estimates to account for this wage reduction in determining the percentage of prisoners in the "coverage gap."

Released prisoners in the coverage gap may be at increased risk for relying on emergency
departments (ED) for routine care. In a retrospective cohort study in Rhode Island of over
6,000 prisoners released over a two year period, at least 24% had one or more documented
emergency department visits within the first year post-release.[15] ED use may be more com-
mon among those with serious chronic conditions. In a Connecticut study of prisoners with
HIV, 56% (85/151) had an ED visit in the first year post-release.[16] While neither of these
studies reported cost, existing evidence suggests that for ambulatory care sensitive conditions,
charges and payments for ED care are about two times those for outpatient care (for similar
conditions and treatment),[17] suggesting that released prisoners in the coverage gap may have
little choice when seeking care but to utilize high-cost health services.
Even for released prisoners who establish healthcare coverage, challenges remain. Beyond
issues common to prisoner re-entry (e.g. establishing employment, securing housing, and
addressing substance use), those with Medicaid may face particular barriers to healthcare
access. Results from a 2013 survey conducted by the Department of Health and Human Ser-
vices Office of Inspector General (OIG) in 32 states with Managed Care Organization (MCO)-
facilitated Medicaid, found that greater than half of providers listed by the MCO as participat-
ing in Medicaid could not be found at their listed location or were not accepting new patients;
among providers who were accepting new patients, greater than 25% had wait times of one
month or longer. The OIG concluded there were "significant vulnerabilities in provider avail-
ability, which is a key indicator for access to care."[18]
In addition to issues of access, released prisoners who obtain healthcare coverage, regardless
of the mechanism, may face discrimination in accessing care. For example, in a small but
important study, Frank et al. found that 42% (73/172) of male parolees felt discriminated
against in a health care setting because of their criminal record.[19] Such discrimination likely
decreases service use, but more research in this area is needed.
To address these problems of access and discrimination, the Transitions Clinic Network has
been developed specifically for former prisoners. This network is based on the Transition
Clinic model, which includes healthcare delivered by providers experienced with criminal jus-
tice-involved populations and a case manager with a personal history of incarceration who
coordinates resources and provides guidance in chronic disease management. In a 2007 ran-
domized trial of 200 recently released prisoners, half received care at a Transitions Clinic (TC)
and half received an "expedited primary care appointment at another safety net clinic." Investi-
gators found that the rate of primary care use was similar across groups but there was less utili-
zation of ED visits among the TC group.[20] Funded under a Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services Innovation award, the TC network is providing care for Medicaid-eligible
released prisoners and is now being evaluated for its ability to lower costs, improve access to
healthcare, and improve health. Results will be forthcoming.
The current analysis has several limitations and our estimates should be interpreted in the
proper context--they provide a plausible set of estimates for healthcare coverage eligibility
among state prisoners with chronic conditions residing in Medicaid expansion and non-expan-
sion states. However, as with the Cuellar and Cheema study, these estimates are based on data
from a 2004 survey. Although existing data suggests that the size of the prison population and
level of morbidity has changed little over time,[1,21,22] joint data on prisoners' morbidity,
income/wealth, and health care eligibility were not available for 2014. Similarly, although the
proportion of inmates eligible for Medicare (i.e. aged  65 years) grew between 2004 and 2014,
the increase was sufficiently modest (~ 1% point) to not incorporate into our analysis. Addi-
tionally, our estimates are based on prisoners' disclosure of health status and income, both of
which may be biased by self-report. Nevertheless, our sensitivity analyses of reported income
provided plausible bounds for the effect of reported income on the number of prisoners in the

coverage gap. Another possible limitation is the probable under- and over-reporting of condi-
tions. Although thorough, the 2004 survey questionnaire did not include all possible health
outcomes, and we chose to focus our analysis on inmates with a history of health conditions
generally considered to be chronic, as these inmates are likely to require healthcare following
release. Further, we focused our analysis on men because men comprise the vast majority of
state prisoners and men and women have different patterns of health conditions, income, and
healthcare coverage. With these differences in mind, a similar set of analyses among women
prisoners are planned for the future.
We note that items informing Medicaid and subsidy eligibility such as family situation and
sentence length were addressed in the 2004 survey, but we found the survey items of insuffi-
cient specificity to inform our analysis. Accordingly, our estimates are based on eligibility crite-
ria for individuals and not for parents/families, and our analysis assumes that all prisoners will
eventually be released. In fact, greater than 95% are released, most within 2­3 years.[22] Also, a
few non-expansion states have extended Medicaid coverage to populations outside of the ACA
framework.[23] Typically these expansions cover relatively small populations with restricted
benefits as compared to full Medicaid expansion, and none are targeted at prisoners specifi-
cally; accordingly, this information was not integrated into our analysis. Similarly, our analysis
does not account for other sources of healthcare coverage such as hospital charity care.
The next Bureau of Justice Statistics nationally representative survey of prisoners to include
information on health conditions, income, entitlements and healthcare coverage is scheduled
for administration in 2015­16; based on past BJS surveys, we anticipate that these data will not
be released until 2019 or later. Until that time, our data may represent the best national esti-
mates for released prisoners' healthcare coverage eligibility.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we estimate that about approximately 70,000 male prisoners with a history of
chronic health problems fall within the healthcare coverage gap. Although existing research
suggests that those without coverage will have inadequate healthcare use and poor health,
more research is needed to delineate these effects. At the same time, future work should lever-
age mechanisms to improve healthcare access and health for this marginalized population.
Although healthcare reform remains a contentious issue, there is growing support across the
political spectrum that more resources--including access to healthcare--are needed if prison-
ers are to successfully re-integrate themselves in the communities to which they return.
Debates over healthcare reform should not impede this important work.
