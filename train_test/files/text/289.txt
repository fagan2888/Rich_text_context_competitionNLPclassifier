Abstract: Weighted survey data with missing data for some covariates
presents a substantial challenge for analysis. We addressed this problem
by using a reweighting technique in a logistic regression model to
estimate parameters. Each survey weight was adjusted by the inverse of
the probability that the possibly missing covariate was observed. The
reweighted estimating equations procedure was compared with a com-
plete case analysis (after discarding any subjects with missing data) in
a simulation study to assess bias reduction. The method was also
applied to data obtained from a national health survey (National Health
and Nutritional Examination Survey or NHANES). Adjusting the sam-
pling weights by the inverse probability of being completely observed
appears to be effective in accounting for missing data and reducing the bias
of the complete case estimate of the regression coefficients.
(Epidemiology 2009;20: 382­390)
Complex survey sampling is widely used for estimation of
population characteristics. Because of their complex sam-
pling frame, analyses should be design based and incorporate
weighting, stratification, and clustering variables. Here, we con-
sider missing data on a covariate in complex surveys, and describe
a reweighting technique for estimating logistic regression parame-
ters. We illustrate the technique on weight loss data from a complex
survey, and assess potential bias reduction via a simulation study.
Motivating Example
The motivating example is from the third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics1,2 to provide national
estimates of the health and nutritional status of the US popula-
tion. NHANES III used stratified, multistage sampling, in which
study participants have different probabilities of being sampled.
Specifically, the United States was stratified into 47 geographic
regions (mainly states) and within each strata, 2 counties were
sampled with probability proportional to the size of the county.
Within each county, households were randomly selected and an
average of 1.6 household members was chosen. Young children,
older persons (65 years and older), Blacks, and Hispanics (Mex-
ican origin) were all oversampled. For generalizability to the
population, both the design and the probability of being selected
into the sample must be incorporated into the analysis.
When analyzing data from NHANES III, each partici-
pant is given a weight proportional to the inverse of the
probability of being selected into the sample (the "weight"
equals the inverse probability of being selected multiplied by
a constant so that the sum of the weights equals the size of the
population). For example, the sample survey weights of the
16,686 participants in NHANES who were at least 21 years
old are up-weighted to represent the 173,673,142 persons in
the US population at the time.
Missing data occur often in sample surveys and arise in 2
forms: unit nonresponse, in which the whole survey is left
unanswered, and item nonresponse, in which an individual does
not answer a specific item on a questionnaire. In NHANES III,
14% of the households did not respond to the survey interview.
An adjustment to the weights for this household unit nonresponse
was provided in the NHANES III database. As described by
Mohadjer et al,3 households that respond are reweighted so that
their weights sum to the total weights of the respondents and
nonrespondents in that county.4 We focused on item nonresponse,
where the possibly missing "item" was a covariate of interest.
METHODS
To illustrate the bias resulting from item nonresponse
and evaluate a technique to reduce such bias, we analyzed

predictors of weight loss, using NHANES III data. The binary
outcome of interest is the study participant's response to:
Have you tried to lose weight in past 12 months? The
covariates of interest are age, sex, ethnicity, education, body
mass index, poverty income ratio, healthcare visit within the
last 2 years (yes or no), family history of heart disease, health-
care visit in the last 2 years (yes or no), and self-reported
cholesterol (high or normal). All 16,686 participants had the
outcome and all covariate information fully recorded, except
"self-reported cholesterol." The 8002 subjects (48%) with miss-
ing self-reported cholesterol data represent 42% of the total
population. With such a large fraction of missing data, a com-
plete case logistic regression analysis (using only the subjects
with no missing data) could give highly biased estimates.
We consider 2 possible missing data processes. The
first, referred to as missing completely at random (MCAR),
means that the probability the covariate (self-reported cho-
lesterol) is missing does not depend on any data values,
including the possibly missing value of the covariate, the
outcome value, or the values of the other covariates. The
second process, referred to as missing at random (MAR),
means that the probability that the covariate is missing can
depend on the observed value of the outcome or the values of
other covariates, but cannot depend on the possibly missing
value of the covariate itself. Under MAR, subjects who report
that they have not tried to lose weight during the last 12
months may be less health conscious, and thus less likely to
know their cholesterol level. Furthermore, under MAR, we
might expect subjects above the poverty threshold, with more
education, with a healthcare visit within the last 2 years, and
with a family history of heart disease, to be more likely to
have cholesterol recorded. Although not considered here, the
missing data process is sometimes "nonignorable," implying
that the probability that the covariate is missing depends on
the possibly missing value of the covariate, even after adjust-
ing for the observed values of the outcome and other covari-
ates. In general, a complete case regression analysis can give
biased estimates unless the missing data are MCAR.
In simple random sampling from an infinite population,
weighted estimating equations5 have been proposed to ana-
lyze data with missing covariate values. With weighted esti-
mating equations, the contribution to the estimating equation
from a complete case is weighted by the inverse probability
of being observed. In simple random sampling, weighted
estimating equations are applicable to regression analyses
when missing covariates are either MAR or MCAR.6 To use
weighted estimating equations, one must estimate a binary
(eg, logistic) regression model for the probability of a covari-
ate value being observed as a function of the outcome and
other covariates, and then weight each subject by the inverse
of this estimated probability. Note that when estimating
regression coefficients with sample survey data without any
missingness, one also uses weighted estimating equations,7
weighted by the sample survey weight. To reduce the poten-
tial bias of the complete case logistic regression estimator, we
apply the weighted estimating equations approach to complex
sample survey data.
We propose a reweighted estimating equation in which
the contribution to the estimating equation from the complete
cases is weighted by the inverse of the joint probability of
being selected into the sample survey and having no covariate
data missing. These weights are the product of the original
fixed sampling weights and the inverse of the predicted
probability of having the covariate value observed. Because
the NHANES III "weights" have already been reweighted for
unit (household) nonresponse, applying the Robins et al5
approach to handle item nonresponse is, in some sense, an
extension of methods already widely used in the sample
survey literature. Below, we apply the weighted estimating
equations approach to the 2 sampling scenarios.
Sample Surveys With No Missing Data
Suppose the finite population consists of i  1, . . ., N
subjects. We choose n subjects from this population with the
sampling design being multistage, and each subject having a
different probability (or weight) of being selected into the
sample.
We are interested in estimating the population regression
of the outcome variable Yi
versus the covariate vector xi
 (xi1
,
xi2
, . . . ., xiK
) and another covariate zi
(the possibly missing
covariate). We consider Yi
as a random observation from the
population, and let 
i
 EYi
xi
, zi
 denote the mean of Yi
given
(Xi
, Zi
). We want to estimate the regression coefficients  
(

To indicate which n subjects are sampled from the pop-
ulation of N subjects, we define the indicator random variable

for i  1, . . ., N, where

design, some of the 
i
s could be correlated (eg, for 2 subjects
within the same cluster). Further, we define pi
 pr(
i

,
xi
, zi
, si
) as the probability of being selected, where si
are
additional variables (in addition to the outcome and covari-
ates of interest) used in the sampling scheme. In general, the
selection probability (pi
) may depend on the outcome (yi
), the
predictor variables (xi
), or additional variables si
(eg, screen-
ing variables) that would not ordinarily be included in the
regression model. In NHANES III, subjects were selected
based on age and race, both covariates of interest (contained
in xi
); however, subjects were also over- or undersampled

based on characteristics of the county of residence (subjects
in counties in which census data showed a higher proportion
of Blacks, Hispanics, or older residents were oversampled).
These county characteristics are the variables in si
. However,
for many NCHS complex sample surveys (including the
National Health Interview Survey, Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey, Health Examination Survey), si
is not con-
tained in the downloadable dataset.
When estimating regression parameters with sample
survey data, one must consider the sampling design. In
particular, Shah7 proposed weighting each subject by the
inverse probability of being selected. With no missing data,
one can use the following weighted logistic regression equa-
tions8 to estimate

(the

tor). Subjects who are oversampled (eg, larger pi

weighted in (1), so that the resulting estimator of  is
reflective of the population from which the sample was
drawn. Using this line of reasoning, Binder9 showed that the
estimate of  from (1) has an approximate normal distribution
with mean  and covariance matrix.

where the expectation depends on the sampling scheme. One
can estimate (2) by replacing 
i
with 
^ i
to obtain the
so-called sandwich variance estimate for sample survey data,
such as that given in SUDAAN7 or SAS Proc SurveyLogistic.
If subjects are over- or undersampled based solely on
the values of the covariates xi
in the model, then the un-
weighted logistic regression equations (giving all individuals
the same weight wi
 1) produces unbiased estimates,10,11
although (2) is needed to estimate the variance if the design
is multistage. Further, if the sampling depended on additional
variables si
, these additional variables can be added to the
logistic regression model, say

Unfortunately, the estimate of * from this model will
be biased for the  of interest if si
is a confounder for the
association between Yi
and covariates (xi
, zi
). Further, the
additional variables si
are often not available, as with
the NHANES III dataset.
Sample Surveys With Missing Covariate Data
Next, we apply the weighted estimating equations ap-
proach to complex sample surveys with missing covariate
data. Recall that zi
is the covariate that can be missing. An
integral part of the Robins et al5 approach is formulating a
logistic regression model for the probability that zi
is ob-
served as a function of Yi
, the observed covariates xi
and the
possibly missing covariate zi
. In particular, we define a binary
random variable Ri
, where Ri
 1, if zi
is observed, and Ri

0, if zi
is not observed, i  1, . . ., N. Then, we formulate a
logistic regression model for 
i
 Pr(Ri
 1yi
, xi
, zi
). This
probability 
i
is often called the missing data mechanism. In
terms of logistic regression models, with parameters , we
can write the 2 missing data mechanisms as shown below
(assuming all effects are additive):
MCAR: logitpr(Ri

, xi
, zi
)  
0
MAR: logitpr(Ri
 1yi
, xi
, zi
)

We focus on MAR mechanisms for missing data, and
note that a more general MAR model can include interactions
among the elements of (yi
, xi
), as well as powers of the
elements of (yi
, xi
).
For the discussion in this paragraph, suppose the pa-
rameters (

are known. In our proposed reweighted estimating equation,
we replace

ugh the missing data mechanism to have zi

selected in the original sample  the inverse probability (

Here, subjects who are oversampled (eg, larger pi
) and
who are more likely to have zi
observed (eg, larger 
i
) are
down-weighted, so that the resulting estimator of  is reflec-
tive of both the population from which the sample was drawn
and the missing data mechanism. The results of Binder9 can
again be used to show that the estimate of  from setting (3)
to 0 has an approximate normal distribution with mean  and
covariance matrix similar to (2), except that

i
pi
is replaced
with
Ri

i

i
pi
. Note that the denominator of Ri

i
in (3) is the joint
probability that Ri

The latter line results from the fact that the probability
of being selected in the original sample (
i
 1) is only a
function of (xi
, yi
, zi
, si
) and not the missingness indicator Ri
.
Further, we assume that the missing data mechanism pr(Ri

1yi
, xi
, zi
, si
) does not depend on the possibly missing zi
(the
MAR assumption), nor si
(the additional variables used in the
sampling scheme). If the si
were available, one could also
include them as covariates in the model for 
i
.
The default estimate in any complex sample survey
package, the complete case analysis, is obtained by discard-
ing all information of any subjects with missing zi
. The
complete case estimate is obtained by using weighted esti-
mating equations similar to (3), except that 
i

Under MAR, the weights are no longer correct because
we are not down-weighting subjects who are more likely to
have zi
observed (eg, larger 
i
); the resulting estimator of 
could be biased.
In practice, the parameters  in the model for 
i
are
rarely known. However, if we replace  with a consistent
estimate, the resulting estimator of  will still be consistent
(Zhao and Lipsitz6). Suppose, we pose the following MAR
missing data model

We note here that 
i
is the population probability that
zi
is observed, given (xi
, yi
). We estimate the population
probability 
i
by using weighted logistic regression, estimat-
ing equations with outcome Ri
and covariates (xi
, yi
) and
weights

i
pi
. In particular, even though Ri
and the covariates
(xi
, yi
) contain no missing components, they were obtained
from the complex survey design, which must be accounted
for when estimating the population probability 
i
. The
weighted estimating equations for  are similar to (1), with
the estimate

estimate the variance of

. Note that, even though 
^ i
is an estimate, and not the true
value, Robins et al12 show that it is valid to use the estimate
in both the estimating equations for , as well as the sand-
wich estimate of its variance. However, 
^ i
must be obtained
from a correctly specified model for 
i
. In particular, a
correctly specified regression model for 
i
is crucial for the
resulting estimator of  from (3) to have minimal bias. As

than underspecify, because underspecification could bias the

From Table 2 we see striking differences between complete
case and reweighted estimating equations for 2 covariates.
For the effect in the age group of 50­64 years, complete case
is significant at   0.05 level, whereas reweighted estimat-
ing equations is not. Hispanic race effect is not significant
using complete case, but is significant at   0.05 level,
using reweighted estimating equations. To explore the differ-
ences between the 2 methods, in the following section, we
conducted a simulation study comparing the 2 approaches.
Simulation Study
We conducted a simulation study to investigate the
performance of RWEE procedures compared with complete
case analysis in the presence of complex survey sampling and
missing covariate data. Data were generated using stratified
random sampling as the type of complex survey sampling.
For each scenario, a finite population consisting of 3 strata is
generated. The population strata sizes were 600, 2400, and
500. One thousand data sets were sampled from the finite
population. Each sampled data set contained observations
drawn independently from the finite population strata with
sample sizes of 200, 300, and 200, respectively. We let the
outcome Yi
, the fully observed covariate Xi
, and the possibly
missing covariate Zi
, all be binary. We formulated the true
model by specifying each probability on the right side of
prri
, yi
, xi
,zi
)  pr(ri
yi
, xi
, zi
)pr(zi
xi
)pr(xi
).
First, we specified pr(xi
) by letting the prevalence of Xi
,
pr(Xi
 1), vary by strata, 70%, 50%, and 30%, respectively.
Because Yi
, Zi
, and Ri
are all binary, 3 logistic models were
used to generate the simulated data:
1) logitpr(Yi

Data were originally generated from 27 configurations,
corresponding to different values of s, s, and s. We report
results from 2 sets (further simulation results can be obtained
from the first author), which correspond to configurations that
resulted in the most bias for the complete case estimate; these
illustrate how well the reweighted estimating equations
method corrects the bias. The first configuration,   ­1.5,
1.0, 0.5 and   ­0.1, 0.5, indicates moderate associations
between Y and Z and between X and Z. The second,  
­1.7, 1.0, 1.0 and   ­0.5, 1.0, indicates a strong
association between Y and Z and between X and Z. For each,
2 missingness models were explored; the first with 
i
, de-
pending on X and Y and the second with 
i
depending
additionally on X and Y and their interaction. The correspond-
ing parameters for these 2 models are   0.1, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0
and   0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, respectively. The prevalence of
missing covariate information is about 30% in both scenarios.
These 2 missingness mechanisms allowed us to explore
overspecification, underspecification, and correct specifica-

tion of the missing data mechanism by fitting different logis-
tic regression missing data models. For the true model for 
i
containing only X and Y, we fit the models containing (1) X
and Y, (2) X, Y, and the interaction, (3) X only, and (4) Y only.
For the situations in which the true missing data mechanism
contains X and Y and their interaction, we fit 2 models (1) X
and Y, (2) X, Y, and X  Y. For comparison, we also fit the
model that would have been obtained if no data had been
missing (ie, before we deleted the missing observations),
which we denote by "ALL DATA."
We applied the reweighted estimating equations and
complete case approaches to each of the simulated data sets,
and compared the results in Tables 4 and 5 in terms of (1)
average point estimates of  over 1000 replications to assess
bias, and (2) coverage probabilities to assess reliability of
inference. Each coverage probability represents the propor-
tion of each set of 1000 replications in which the 95%
confidence interval contains the true finite population param-
eter value. With 1000 replications, these estimated coverage
probabilities should be contained in the interval (0.937­
0.964) 95% of the time if the true coverage probability
is 95%.
Tables 4 and 5 present the true and fitted models for R
given its predictors are denoted by (Rpredictors). In Tables 4
and 5, when correctly specifying or overspecifying the miss-
ingness mechanism, the reweighted estimating equations
method is unbiased and shows good coverage probabilities
for 
0
,
x
, and 
z
. For all missing data models, there was very
little bias in the complete case estimate of 
z
, but the
complete case estimates of 
0
and 
x
was generally biased.
When the true missing data model is RX, Y (with no inter-
action), the complete case estimates of 
x
are underestimating
the true parameter. When the true missing data model is RX,
Y, but we underspecify by fitting RX or RY, the results using
reweighted estimating equations are similar to complete case
for 
0
and 
x
. Using reweighted estimating equations, under-
specification of the missing data model when the true model
is RX, Y, X  Y can also lead to bias for estimation of 
0
and

x
, but not 
z
. In general, with respect to bias, it appears that
the reweighted estimating equations perform similar to com-
plete case when the missingness model is underspecified, but
outperforms complete case when the missingness model is
correctly specified or overspecified.
DISCUSSION
We compared a complete case analysis to an analysis
that used reweighted estimating equations with complex sur-
vey data. Our empirical example and simulation study both
used logistic regression. In the NHANES example, with 9
covariates, 1 of which is missing for 48% of the subjects, we
found striking differences between complete case and re-
weighted estimating equations for 2 covariates. In the simu-
lations, adjusting the sampling weights with the inverse
probability of zi
being observed appears to be effective for
obtaining unbiased estimates of the regression coefficients
when we correctly specified the missing-data model.

The simulation study also showed the importance of
correctly specifying the missing-data model when using re-
weighted estimating equations. In particular, a correctly spec-
ified logistic regression model for 
i
is crucial for the re-
weighted estimating equations of  to have minimal bias. As
such, we suggest being liberal when including variables to
predict the probability of observing zi
.
We note that Robins et al5 have proposed ways to modify
their weighted estimating equations to gain more efficiency.
However, the type of sample surveys we discuss here are
typically so large that efficiency is not of that great concern as it
might be in other settings. The main issue here is to obtain
estimates with missing data that have minimal bias. Robins and
Ritov14 have also proposed weighted estimating equations that
are more robust to misspecification of the missing data model,
the so-called doubly robust estimating equations, which could be
modified for use with sample survey data. We note that doubly
robust estimates require much additional programming, whereas
the method we have proposed can easily be implemented in any
sample survey package such as SAS Proc SurveyLogistic, as
shown in Table 3.
With a single covariate subject to missingness, the idea
of reweighted estimating equations is a simple one and
modifying the sampling weights does not complicate the
method considerably. However, even in simple random sam-
pling, the weights and standard errors can become complex if
more than 1 covariate is missing.15 The extension of the
weighted estimating equations to arbitrary missing covariate
data patterns entails creating missing data indicators for each
covariate, and becomes much more cumbersome. However,
in this case, one can combine our approach with that of
Rotnitzky et al16 for arbitrary missing covariate data patterns
in simple random sample. In particular, we would replace 
i
with 
i
multiplied by each missing data indicator and pi
with
pi
multiplied by each missing data probability.
