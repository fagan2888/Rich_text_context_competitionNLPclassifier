Background to Education in the Gulf
States
Education in the Gulf monarchies has long been influenced
by strong religious and societal views regarding the goals of
schooling. The first schools in the Gulf were kuttabs--that
is, places were reciting and memorizing the holy Qur'an was
taught (Bahgat, 1999). Schools were also meant to replace
family upbringing and graduate citizens who could quickly
learn to read and write to work in offices and to teach in
schools (Quaddummi, 1995). Due to these influences, and
the resultant approaches to teaching and learning based on
inculcation and rote pedagogy (Quaddummi, 1995), the Gulf
monarchies have struggled to find the balance between their
traditional values and the growing requirements of modern
education (Bahgat, 1999).
Findlow (2008) offers an analysis of this balance and
argues that modernizing education in theArab states is driven
by political and transnational agendas that underpin educa-
tion reform in the context where secularism and religious
fundamentalism meet. This is why we have seen modern cur-
ricula and teaching approaches being drawn into the local
context of the Gulf countries as a means of alternatives to
education that has been perceived by international powers to
be in need of modernization but not considered from the
local perspective (Hayes et al. 2015). On the other hand,
research in areas of teacher work in particular suggests that
this modernization does not necessarily take place within
practitioner attitudes toward education and that strong reli-
gious and regional influences still underlie pedagogical prac-
tices in schools (Ali & Al-Kazemi 2007; Mansour, 2013).
Particularly relevant to this article is what Jonathan, Ong,
and Hairon (2009) highlight, that, despite working within the
boundaries of fast moving internationalized education
reforms, teachers in Bahrain continue to demonstrate the
Islamic influence on their attitudes toward work. Jonathan et
al. (2009) compare how two culturally different groups of
teachers engaged with self-evaluations of their work, and
provide explanations to particular ratings of their teaching
and leadership skills in cultural traditions and religious
beliefs of teachers in Bahrain and Singapore. Their analysis
showed that Bahraini teachers' evaluations of their own
classroom behaviors were significantly higher than those of
teachers in Singapore. The authors linked this discrepancy to

The Role of Cultural Contexts in Research
Design Decisions: Reflections on the
Conflicting Study Results in the Bahraini
Context
Aneta L. Hayes1
Abstract
Self-reporting surveys in social science are commonly criticized for generating results that are often found not to reflect
the actual behavior of participants. This article discusses the limitations of such surveys specifically in exploring the Arabian
Gulf context and explains how the Islamic Work Ethic can create biases in survey research. The reflections in this article
are based on the author's experiences in conducting social research in Bahrain using self-reporting questionnaires and focus
groups. The discussion presented in this article highlights the salience of socio-cultural factors in designs of research studies
and suggests that the cultural context in which a study is conducted may significantly affect the adequacy of specific research
methods. This article also implies that, due to societal values, using self-reporting surveys to identify patterns in institutional
practice may result in overrated self-evaluations rather than a description of "what is."

Islamic influences on work in Bahrain and the value of
"effort" that holds an important place in the Islamic Work
Ethic (IWE).
Jonathan et al. (2009) argue that kinship, effort, and com-
petitiveness, which are all core values of the IWE, are still
strongly present in Islamic teaching communities like
Bahrain. They were described to have influenced the teach-
ers to self-enhance their behavior because Islam praises
those who work hard to achieve their goals (Jonathan et al.,
2009). Taking these conclusions into account, it seems also
that IWE could help in explaining the conflicting research
results that will be discussed in this article, especially that the
balance between secularism and religious fundamentalism in
education in the Gulf seems not to have been completely
settled (Pavan, 2014). Within the tensions of global versus
local, teachers need to find their way of "pleasing" the gov-
ernment who seem to deploy international curricula as a
means to educational improvement but which has been found
to violate their own beliefs about education (Hayes et al.,
2015). Thus, the IWE seems to be a legitimate lens through
which explanations of the ways in which those
"internally struggling" teachers engage in research could be
understood.
Theoretical Framework--The IWE
IWE is an orientation that originates from the teaching of the
Qur'an that describes people's attitudes toward work in the
Islamic context (Rokhman, 2010). It describes a set of prin-
ciples that guides people's approach to work and their par-
ticipation in the workplace (Rokhman, 2010). It also
describes work as a virtue and necessity for establishing
equilibrium in private and professional life (Rokhman,
2010).
Ali and Al-Owaihan (2008) state that the main principles
of the IWE include not only pursuing legitimate business,
earning wealth according to capacities, quality of work, pay-
ing appropriate wages, relying on self, and generosity but
also avoiding bribery, cheating, greed, and monopoly. These
principles are derived from the history of the Islamic state
where merchants were responsible for the development of its
power by trading honestly and building strong relationships
(Ali, 2001). IWE is therefore based on the belief that those
who work hard will be awarded, people should take advan-
tages of the opportunities that enable them to build their
wealth, and they should conduct their business in a fair,
transparent, and just way (Ali & Al-Owaihan, 2008).
What is particularly important in looking at IWE as a lens
for understanding research is the fact that it differs from the
Protestant Work Ethic (PWE), followed largely in Western
contexts, in that it emphasizes intentions rather than out-
comes (Ali & Al-Owaihan, 2008). Although this difference
has been viewed by some researchers to be unimportant in
understanding work outcomes (Awan & Akram, 2012), it
might be crucial for understanding research outcomes
reported in this article. Ali and Al-Owaihan (2008) highlight
that
. . . intentions constitute significant pillars in the IWE. They
clearly differentiate the IWE from the work ethics of other
faiths. One of the fundamental assumptions in Islam is that
intention rather than result is the criterion upon which work is
evaluated in terms of benefits to the community. (p. 12)
Jonathan et al.'s (2009) findings cited in the previous sec-
tion clearly link those intentions to the high self-ratings of
teachers in Bahrain. Those links were significant for under-
standing the outcomes of the research discussed in this arti-
cle as one set of findings presented in later sections of this
article was taken from a survey study whose aim was to
describe the current teaching practices in English language
education in Bahrain. Understanding the possible influence
of the IWE on teachers work helped in concluding that sur-
veying teachers in schools about their practices was likely to
be viewed by those teachers as evaluations of their profes-
sional practice. Following the IWE, we can conclude that
these evaluations were likely to be based on good intentions,
as opposed to the actual classroom behavior (Ali &
Al-Owaihan, 2008; Jonathan et al., 2009)
In addition, a deeper analysis of the current English teach-
ing context in Bahrain can also help to fully rationalize the
IWE as the theoretical framework for the conclusions drawn
here. It seems that the teachers who took part in the survey
research could have been under a lot of "performance pres-
sures" associated with the change in the approaches to teach-
ing in schools that were escalated after the quality assurance
review by the National Authority for Qualifications &
Quality Assurance of Education and Training (NQQAET;
Directorate of Government School Reviews, 2014).
The NQQAET review commanded many schools to con-
duct accurate self-evaluations to improve their overall per-
formance. High performance was going to be judged based
on greater academic achievement of students and higher
teaching standards (Directorate of Government School
Reviews, 2014). Teachers' professional practice was there-
fore thoroughly inspected and the results from the reviews
were used to design new professional development programs
(Directorate of Government School Reviews, 2014). The
effectiveness of teachers' work was therefore judged on how
well they have followed on from the training programs they
received (Directorate of Government School Reviews,
2014).
Considering these work pressures, the emphasis on inten-
tion in the IWE provides a useful lens for conceptualizing the
overrated teacher behavior in the survey study discussed in
this article. The IWE holds business motives in the highest
regard and teaches its followers to "persist in [their] action
with a noble end in mind" (Imam Ali, cited in Ali, 2001). For
teachers who follow the IWE, the important instruction is
that "failure to perfect your work while you are sure of the
reward is injustice to yourself" (Ali, 2001, p. 507). The IWE
Hayes 3
also holds that an important obligation for every man is
engagement in economic activities of their nation (Ali,
2001). This in Bahrain can be realized through improving
education.
Bahrain's transition to knowledge economy has spurred
views on education grounded in contributing toward the
nation's public good, underpinned by the country's vision to
become the regional economic power in the Gulf (Secretariat
General of the Higher Education Council, 2012). The IWE
advocates this approach to education by emphasizing that
struggle in working toward the realization of national ideals
is necessary, which makes the IWE a leading force advocat-
ing productivity at work (Ali, 2001). Within this context,
teachers need to perform very efficiently to meet the stan-
dards that are set for them, demonstrating loyalty to their
responsibilities for raising student standards and commit-
ment to public good.
Workers who follow the IWE have been found to have an
increased sense of commitment to public good through striv-
ing to meet the organizational requirements (Shakil, 2011).
In fact, the higher the standards set by an institution, the
higher the commitment of workers seems to be (Shakil,
2011). Within this commitment, however, the main emphasis
still seems to fall on intentions rather than the actual result of
work, and those intentions become the main criterion for
evaluation of work (Shakil, 2011).
The IWE therefore provides a useful framework for
understanding teachers' thinking about their work and the
motivations behind the high self-ratings of their own behav-
ior in the survey study that will be analyzed here. It seems to
suggest that teachers in Bahrain are highly committed to
their work and that, through this commitment, they develop
intentions to work hard to satisfy the needs of their institu-
tions. Jonathan et al. (2009) had already suggested that these
intentions may also affect the validity of evaluations of
teachers' professional practice in the Gulf states, as they are
likely to be biased due to the emphasis on those intentions.
This article will additionally argue that the influence of the
IWE also creates biases in Gulf research which uses self-
reporting surveys to describe "what is."
Review of Literature
Societal and religious beliefs have increasingly been cited in
literature as a factor affecting the work of teachers, the deci-
sions made by teachers, and the perceptions of teachers of
the research process (e.g., Abu-Saad, 2003; Bahgat, 1999;
Mansour, 2013).
Mansour (2013), for instance, argues that it is imperative
that we consider teachers' views and perspectives on educa-
tion and their own profession as they are crucial in under-
standing educational provision. This article will argue that it
is also important to consider how teachers view the research
process and its goals before making decisions regarding the
study methods. As teachers' personal experiences and reli-
gious beliefs seem to perpetuate their work, it is also plausible
that they play a role in teachers' attitudes toward research
about this work. Mansour (2013) finds that teachers' own
religious beliefs and societal values influence their perspec-
tives on teaching and learning before entering a teacher train-
ing course, which in turn affected how they engaged with
their training program. The same is said about the research
process as research literature on the Arabian Gulf, suggests
that cultural beliefs become salient when participants engage
with a particular research method (e.g., Thomas, 2008).
These conclusions are significant for the discussion in this
article because if, for instance, the religious beliefs of pre-
service teachers are considered to be crucial for their engage-
ment with training (Mansour, 2013), and if collective nature
of Arab societies is thought to be key to conducting focus
groups (Thomas, 2008), socio-cultural influences, such as
the IWE, are likely to also be crucial for developing an
understanding of how teachers respond to survey items about
their professional practices.
In fact, a report presented by the International Bureau of
Education and National Institute for Educational Research of
Japan (IBE & NIER; 1995) suggested that teachers in
Bahrain hold specific views on the purposes of research.
These views reject everything that could threaten their pre-
rogatives or interests. This has been reflected in the follow-
ing words in the Geneva meeting where the report was
presented:
We can certainly observe the paradoxical behaviour of a great
part of teachers who previously were described as supporters of
using research findings in the Ministry's decisions. In fact, this
group of teachers remain enthusiastic to support such findings as
long as these findings are presented as a controversial matter,
and therefore as long as their support could bring them in some
intellectual distinction or some credit . . . In reality most of the
field practitioners are not so enthusiastic to carry out any practice
which implies mastering new or additional skills. Therefore,
when reforms fail, the bureaucracy can claim that it was not
from their lack of effort. (IBE & NIER, 1995, p. 50)
After receiving significant criticism of their practice from
1980 onward (Al-Ahmed, 1994; Al-Hawatchi, 1990), as well
as the recommendations from the NQQAET to regularly par-
ticipate in professional development training (Directorate of
Government School Reviews, 2014), it seems that Bahraini
teachers might wish to engage in research with the view of
protecting their professional prerogatives. Influenced by the
IWE, and therefore wishing to protect their future reward,
the teachers are likely to engage in research in a way that will
demonstrate their intentions to improve their skills and com-
mitment to their work. Being seen as not trying could be
viewed by their supervisors as very damaging to their careers,
especially that the majority of managers and government
officials in the Gulf have been found to build their work rela-
tions on the IWE (Ali &Al-Kazemi, 2007;Ali &Al-Owaihan,
2008).
"Effort" in particular seems to characterize the work of
education leaders in Bahrain. The Ministry of Education in
4 SAGE Open
Bahrain have constantly tried [emphasis added] to reform
the national curriculum in English to shift the focus of lan-
guage education from traditional teaching to communicative
approaches and have continually strived [emphasis added]
for excellence and innovation (Al-Sulaiti, 2002). Other
Islamic leaders and workers, outside the Gulf, in industries
such as public sector in Pakistan (Ahmad, 2011) or financial
sector in Indonesia (Rokhman, 2010) have also been
described as being driven by effort and innovation capability
[emphasis added]. Jonathan et al.'s (2009) view is that it is
effort [emphasis added] that is behind the high ratings of
classroom behavior of teachers in Bahrain, which are
grounded in intentions to work hard [emphasis added] rather
than the actual actions. This suggests strong links to the IWE
and the possibility that the research participants in the study
in this article, not wishing to be disclosed as lacking commit-
ment and effort during the research process, engaged in
research in a self-appraising and protective manner.
Teachers in particular seem to be the group of profession-
als who are most likely to follow the IWE as the ethical
aspects of their professions are built on moral teaching, pub-
lic good, and promoting citizenship (Abu-Saad & Hendrix,
1995). These are also the core values of the IWE which is
whythe external dominations of foreign cultures connected
in the case of Bahrain with transnationalization of education
do not play a significant role in the change of teacher atti-
tudes towards work. Research in Arab teachers'values domi-
nated by the culture of Israel revealed that the "Western"
organization of the school where the teachers worked did not
seem to have any effect on their attitudes to work (Abu-Saad,
2003). The research found that individual effort in meeting
obligations toward their organizations, underpinned by con-
tribution to society and public good, was the strongest value
underlying those teachers' behavior (Abu-Saad, 2003). Abu-
Saad (2003) also found that personal effort and achievement
were equally valued.
Personal effort, achievement, and best self-interests were
strongly emerging inAbu-Saad's (2003) study due to societal
pressures. Both men and women indicated that these were
important work values; however, women scored higher on
these IWE factors. Although making a distinction between
genders is unnecessary for the objectives of this study, Abu-
Saad's conclusions explaining the difference in scores
between women and men effectively contextualize the expla-
nations of the findings in this article. Abu-Saad (2003) pro-
poses that the importance of self-interest, achievement,
determination, and personal effort for women was under-
pinned by the need to prove themselves in a profession where
they "are not welcomed by all" (p. 48). This has parallels to
the situation of teachers in Bahrain which was explained
above, concluding that within the context of the current
school improvement program, these teachers need to also
constantly prove themselves to receive professional recogni-
tion based on self-evaluations (Directorate of Government
School Reviews, 2014). It is possible, therefore, that the
surveys in this study about teacher practice were viewed by
the teachers as self-evaluation tools, and the IWE provides a
framework for explaining this conclusion.
The strong presence of IWE in Arab workers values (Ali
& Al-Kazemi, 2007; Ali & Al-Owaihan, 2008) highlights
that the separation of religion from the work context, despite
specifically strong secular influences on education in the
Gulf (Findlow, 2008), might not have fully taken place. For
this reason, the IWE becomes a useful lens for interpreting
the conflicting results of the study discussed in this article.
Taking into account that teachers'values shape how they per-
ceive specific circumstances (Schoenfeld, 1998), where tak-
ing part in the research is viewed as one of them, the IWE
will be used as a framework for understanding what goals
teachers establish for themselves in a research project. The
principles underlying IWE have been used in a number of
research studies discussing the impact of the IWE on various
job variables (Awan &Akram, 2012). Engaging with research
has been assumed in this study as one of the job variables
too, something that teachers in Bahrain perhaps felt they had
to do to receive recognition, as the recommendations from
the NQQAET encouraged them to continually review
research as part of professional development. This perhaps
explains why they decided to take part in the study that will
be explained below in the first place, but exploring how they
thought about their responses through the lens of IWE can
help us make better decisions regarding research methods,
particularly the use of surveys. This article aims to discuss
the limitations of such surveys, specifically in exploring the
Arabian Gulf context and explains how the IWE can create
biases in survey research.
Background to the Research in Bahrain
The research that is used for the discussion in this article had
been conducted in Bahrain for several years. The most sig-
nificant stages of this research in terms of the aim of this
article are centered around two particular sets of findings.
The first one is the findings from the self-reporting question-
naire-survey; the second, from the focus groups that were
conducted following the survey. To better understand how
these findings are used to discuss the limitations of self-
reporting surveys in the Arabian Gulf which is the aim of this
article, some contextual information is presented below.
The overall aim of the research in Bahrain was to explore
the success of Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) in
state schools through self-reporting surveys and focus groups
with English teachers. The CLT was a new English teaching
reform in schools at the time of research and describing how it
was received in the new socio-cultural context was important.
A survey was therefore designed to gather information about
how and whether the classroom practice changed after the
introduction of the new reform. Using the survey seemed to be
an obvious choice as descriptive surveys are commonly applied
in social studies to examine organizational situations at a
Hayes 5
specific time (Kelley, Clark, Brown, & Sitzia, 2003). Surveys
are methods that allow researchers to examine the situations in
institutions by describing actions, experiences, and knowledge
of the employees (Kelley et al., 2003). Therefore, the survey
contained items regarding various aspects of CLT and the
teachers were asked to indicate which aspects are implemented
in classrooms (details of these items can be viewed in
Tables 1-4). Overall, 85 teachers from 10 randomly selected
schools completed the survey and data were analyzed descrip-
tively to identify the patterns in teaching.
Follow-up focus groups were conducted to explore in
more depth the items indicated in the survey-questionnaire.
Apart from the purposes of triangulation to develop greater
confidence in the research data, the primary aim of the focus
groups was to discuss in more detail the teaching situation at
that time. The emerging patterns from the focus groups were,
however, completely contradictory to the findings indicated
by the survey data, which formed the rationale for this article
that highlights the limitations of self-reporting surveys in
exploring work contexts in the Arabian Gulf.
Although contradictory results may sometimes be noted
during a typical triangulation process, it was felt that the con-
flict of results between those two sets of data was also rooted
in the specific socio-cultural frameworks of the research par-
ticipants. The survey was piloted with a number of potential
participants who were asked to provide comments about the
clarity of the purpose of the study, the ambiguity of the items,
and redundancy of some questions (Bryman, 2008). No com-
ments from teachers in the pilot study were returned that
indicated any methodological issues with the survey. The
survey items were additionally reviewed by the panel of
experts, which added to internal validity of the research.
Lack of methodological issues with the survey had led to
conclusions presented in this article. The research on the
impact of the IWE on teacher behavior presented above sug-
gested that contextual factors and teacher socio-cultural
frameworks are important for understanding their attitudes
toward work (e.g., Abu-Saad, 2003). Combined with the lack
of methodological issues in the survey research in Bahrain, it
is argued in this article that they are also important in under-
standing teacher attitudes toward research. The review of
literature above suggested that the IWE is an equally legiti-
mate framework for understanding individuals' perspectives
on research (Jonathan et al., 2009), which has conceptualized
the aim of this article to argue that limitations of survey
research in the Arabian Gulf may additionally be caused by
the Islamic influences on research participants.
Below, the selected results that show the contradictions
between the survey and the focus groups data are presented.
Survey Data
Tables 1 to 4 present the percentages of teacher responses to
items related to teaching and assessing reading and writing
skills in English.
Within writing strategies (Table 1), the findings imply
that a large number of teachers place more emphasis on
grammatical and mechanical aspects of language teaching,
rather than areas related to text coherence. Trends that are
important for the focus of this article can be noted in relation
to the focus of writing, where great importance of the writing
product, the writing process, and the development of ideas
were shown.
Similarly, trends shown in Table 2 with regard to assess-
ing writing indicate important conclusions in terms of the
issues raised in this article. These are mainly related to results
which show that teachers strongly emphasize marking for
content, language, and style.

Table 3 demonstrates that teachers emphasize a variety of
reading skills. The results show that the most common read-
ing techniques practiced in Bahraini schools are based on
general understanding of texts and they include inferring
meaning and identifying main ideas. Table 3 also indicates
that teachers often use more focused methods and require the
students to read for specific information and guess the mean-
ing of unknown words.
In terms of assessing reading (Table 4), the teachers indi-
cated that most frequently, they ask the students to recall
information from texts. They also focus on questions that
require interpretation of meaning, evaluation of texts, and
critical analysis.
All the survey data presented above are quite contradic-
tory to what emerged during the qualitative focus groups.
The findings below illustrate these contradictions.
Focus Groups Data
Contrary to the results presented above, during the focus groups,
the teachers indicated that teaching English is based on memo-
rizing model answers for the exam. The teacher comments
reported here were coded using consecutive numbers--that is,
number 1 was given to the teacher who spoke first, number 2 to
the second teacher in each school. Letters A to J were randomly
assigned to the 10 schools visited during data collection.
The quotes below illustrate the contradictions with the
survey data.Although only selected comments are presented,
it needs to be highlighted that these were repeatedly made by
many teachers in all schools.
The first quote presents contradictions to the results in
Table 1 where it was indicated that great importance is placed
on the product and process of writing, as well as coherent
development of ideas. Teacher 3B explains that it is difficult
to apply these techniques in Bahraini classrooms because
students are only interested in memorizing model answers
for the exam.
They take the model writing from the teachers. They just need
the model for the exam. Yes, we provide them with the model
writing . . . They hate you when you try to help them and explain
what should be done first and then next, they don't like that, just
direct monotonous way of teaching. That's it. (Teacher 3B)
Teacher 1E additionally explained that it is also difficult
to teach in the way indicated in the survey because it is not
the accepted way of teaching in Bahrain.
They have model answers and they learn by heart. But, to be
frank, it's not only the teacher; it's not the teacher's choice to do
that. In the past, [name] used to give us the topic that will be on
the exam and we used to give them a piece of writing and they
learnt it by heart. And the teacher who doesn't do this will be
blamed by the students and the parents [all agree]. (Teacher 1E)
This way of teaching is driven by students' aspirations to
achieve high marks in the final exam, which contradicts the
methods of teaching and assessing writing and reading in
English indicated in the survey:
They only want to study because they will have the same
question in the final. They don't want extra information.
(Teacher 1A)
Very often they say "Give us the writing, and that's it, we don't
want reading, grammar" and so on because they focus only on
writing, they are learning only for tests. (Teacher 3J)
My students always say that we only need the writing in your
class because this is the thing that will be tested in the exam.
"We don't need to study anything else. Just give us the writing,
we will study and we will pass." (Teacher 6H)

Overall, the results from the survey indicated that various
higher order language skills are taught in Bahraini schools
and that students' knowledge is assessed in a way that
encourages critical thinking. However, the focus groups
comments from the same teachers who completed the survey
regarding foreign language pedagogy suggested that learning
of English is entirely based on memorization and that assess-
ment is based on reproduction of knowledge. This has had
significant implications for the aim of this article, supporting
the argument about the limitations of self-reporting surveys
in the Arabian Gulf context.
So, What Implications Arose From
These Conflicting Results?
As indicated at the beginning of this article, surveys are com-
monly used to examine "what is" and to describe the state of
affairs at a specific time (Kelley et al., 2003). It is also generally
known that self-reporting surveys are likely to generate evalu-
ations of behavior that may be higher than the actual actions
because respondents always try to create a positive image of
themselves (Bryman, 2008). Although this has been widely
acknowledged, the analysis in this article indicates that social
influences developed through religious affiliations may addi-
tionally affect the ratings from self-evaluation questionnaires.
The concept of the cultural context as a factor in making
research decisions has not been fully embraced by method-
ological researchers, which is where the discussion of the
conflicting results from research in Bahrain in this article,
through the lens of IWE, has a potential to make significant
contributions. This discussion indicates that the socio-
cultural context in which the research is to be conducted
might play an important role in research decision making. It
is also suggested that certain cultures might be more influen-
tial than the others, and the use of IWE in this article to
explain the conflict of results substantiates the differing roles
of "culture effect" on research outcomes.
While seeking explanations to the conflicting results that
were generated in Bahrain, the significance of the IWE as the
theoretical framework was quite strong. Viewing the conflict
in results through the IWE allowed for greater appreciation
of the role of culture in research designs. The IWE is built on
four pillars--effort, competition, transparency, and morally
responsible conduct--which guide conducting business in
Islamic societies (Ali & Al-Owaihan, 2008). Because effort
in Islam is held in highest regard (Ali & Al-Owaihan, 2008,
p.13), it provides a plausible explanation of why the contra-
dictions between survey and focus groups data occurred. It
suggests that the conflict in results could be related to the
self-rating nature of the survey which was based on teachers'

self-appraisals of how they teach the English language. If
Islam praises those who work hard to achieve the desired
goals (Ali & Al-Owaihan, 2008), it is possible that the teach-
ers overrated their classroom behavior. It is also possible that
if the survey was based on the ratings from, for instance,
their reporting bodies, the biases in the Bahraini research
could have been avoided.
Jonathan et al. (2009) state that, generally, it is quite common
that self-ratings of what teachers do in the classroom tend to be
much higher compared with the actual pedagogical behavior.
They also state that it is particularly common in teaching com-
munities such as Bahrain because of the IWE where "the value
of work in the IWE is derived from the accompanying inten-
tions rather than from the result of work" (p. 268). This is why
"Bahraini teachers seem to engage in more self-promoting to
ensure what they indicated in the rating scales were reflective of
what was expected" (Jonathan et al., 2009, p. 268). This does
not necessarily mean that they do not teach according to the
expected levels but that their self-evaluation is primarily based
on the long-term objectives of their work.
It was already explained in the background section of this
article that Bahraini teachers are under a lot of pressure con-
nectedwiththenewschoolimprovementprogram(Directorate
of Government School Reviews, 2014). It was also explained
that, for English teachers, this improvement brought about a
new teaching reform based on the CLT approach (Al-Baharna,
2005). The items of the survey discussed in this article there-
fore matched many of the CLT techniques because the inten-
tion of the study in Bahrain was to describe the status of this
reform in local schools. It is therefore possible that the teach-
ers who completed the survey recognized these items and
overrated their behavior in the classroom, acting in their self-
interest (Jonathan et al., 2009). It is also possible that the
teachers did it because they thought that the survey was eval-
uating whether they were doing what they were supposed to
do and, as explained earlier in the literature review, they per-
haps thought that the research was going to give them some
kind of distinction (IBE & NIER, 1995). However, during the
follow-up focus group sessions, when the teachers were asked
to elaborate more on the difficulties caused by the context in
which they were teaching, they were able to reveal the truth
because they perhaps thought that the research could result in,
for example, reducing some of the teaching pressures.
Kabasakal and Bodur (2002) argue that at times of diffi-
culty, Arab societies come together due to their socially
ingrained group loyalty and collective group support.
Thomas (2008) explains that this loyalty is also translated to
focus groups where participants "stand together" to discuss a
research problem, which is why focus groups participants are
more likely to reveal the truth. Therefore, while the reflec-
tions in this article indicate that the societal values of Arabs
in the Gulf affect survey designs in social research in a nega-
tive way, the same values seem to play a positive role in stud-
ies based on focus groups. Thomas (2008) argues that the use
of focus groups in social research is suitable for researchers
who engage in exploring Arab cultures because the social
collectivity that characterizes Arab people is extremely perti-
nent to this form of interviewing. According to Thomas
(2008), trust between in-group members in Arab cultures is
seen as central to conducting group investigations, which, in
turn, allows for cultural values and beliefs of the researched
to have some breathing space. The broader experiences of
conducting focus groups research in Bahrain, which are not
reported along the results in this article due to its focus on the
conflict between survey and its related focus group data, sup-
port this view in that they show real contributions to knowl-
edge as a result of the collective perspective on social practice
Hayes et al., 2015).
Finally, the fact that the school teachers were aware that
this research was approved by the Ministry of Education
might have led the teachers to believe that it was looking to
evaluate how the programs in Bahrain were taught. This, on
one hand, might be related to reflexivity, which is commonly
acknowledged in social research, but, on the other, it might
also stem from the strong influences of the IWE. Effort in the
IWE is held in the highest regard (Ali & Al-Owaihan, 2008),
which invariably involves constant evaluations of self. The
report on the perceptions of research in Bahrain cited in the
literature review (IBE & NIER, 1995) also explained that
teachers are likely to take part in studies that will show their
efforts and bring them rewards for their hard work. Therefore,
it is possible that they viewed the research discussed in this
article as an opportunity to earn some credit, which is why
they might have rated their performance very highly.
Conclusion
Overrated participant behavior is quite common in survey
research; however, the important conclusion that emerged
here was that these ratings may vary depending on the cul-
tural context of research participants. Jonathan et al.'s (2009)
research cited earlier supports this by demonstrating differ-
ences in self-evaluations of professional behavior between
Asian and Bahraini teachers, who were influenced by differ-
ent orientations on their work. It is therefore possible that if
the research discussed in this article was conducted in the
Asian context, fewer contradictions would have been found
between the survey and the focus groups data.
The important implications from the discussion of the
research results from Bahrain in this article are that we ought to
consider the deeper values of the culture we are researching in
our decision making regarding research methods. It has been
argued here, mainly through the analysis of the impact of the
IWE on teacher behavior and attitudes toward work, that socio-
cultural frameworks of research participants can create biases
in survey research. The discussion in this article indicated this
by examining how cultural beliefs can create an influence on
the type of data that is normally produced through the use of
standard surveys. Surveys are used in social science to describe
"what is" (Bryman, 2008), which is why a descriptive survey
was also designed to examine the situation of English language
education in Bahrain. The strong societal beliefs of teachers,
Hayes 9
however, influenced by the IWE, seemed to have had a signifi-
cant impact on generating specific data. The analysis also sug-
gested that these influences were perhaps even stronger than
the methodological assumptions underlying survey research.
This has significant implications for building designs of
research studies in Islamic context where religiously shaped
views on self-evaluations, work, and performance may affect
the adequacy of specific research methods.
Thus, the main recommendations from the analysis pre-
sented in this article are that researchers develop a deep
understanding of the culture in which the research is to be
conducted. The reflections presented here have indicated the
need to do this, specifically for the survey research. The dis-
cussion in this article provided evidence which implies that
societal beliefs should be considered equally with any philo-
sophical, theoretical, and methodological assumptions in
research design decision making.
