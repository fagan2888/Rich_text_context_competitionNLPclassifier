IMPORTANCE Since 1999, the United States has experienced increases in morbidity and
mortality associated with nonmedical use of prescription opioids.
OBJECTIVE To assess national trends in and characteristics of nonmedical prescription opioid
use and use disorders and the national trend in related mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prevalence of nonmedical use and use disorders and
related risk factors were based on data from 472 200 persons aged 18 through 64 years who
participated in the 2003-2013 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Mortality was based
on the 2003-2013 National Vital Statistics System's Multiple Cause of Death Files.
EXPOSURES Prevalence of nonmedical use of prescription opioids.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Nonmedical prescription opioid use and use disorders.
RESULTS Among adults aged 18 through 64 years, the prevalence of nonmedical use of
prescription opioids decreased from 5.4% (95% CI, 5.08%-5.70%) in 2003 to 4.9% (95% CI,
4.58%-5.22%) in 2013 (absolute difference, -0.5%; 95% CI, -0.11% to -0.89%), but the
prevalence of prescription opioid use disorders increased from 0.6% (95% CI, 0.54%-0.76%)
in 2003 to 0.9% (95% CI, 0.75%-1.01%) in 2013 (absolute difference, 0.3%; 95% CI,
0.03%-0.43%). The 12-month prevalence of high-frequency use (200 days) also increased
from 0.3% (95% CI, 0.19%-0.35%) in 2003 to 0.4% (95% CI, 0.31%-0.48%) in 2013
(absolute difference, 0.1%; 95% CI, 0.01%-0.29%). Mortality assessed by drug overdose
death rates involving prescription opioids increased from 4.5 per 100 000 (95% CI,
4.42-4.61) in 2003 to 7.8 per 100 000 (95% CI, 7.64-7.89) in 2013 (absolute difference, 3.3;
95% CI, 3.09-3.41) among adults aged 18 through 64 years. The mean number of days of
nonmedical use of prescription opioids increased from 2.1 (95% CI, 1.83-2.37) in 2003 to 2.6
(95% CI, 2.27-2.85) in 2013 (absolute difference, 0.5, 95% CI, 0.05-0.86). The
model-adjusted prevalence of having prescription opioid use disorders among nonmedical
users increased to 15.7% (95% CI, 13.87%-17.67%) in 2010, 16.1% (95% CI, 14.36%-17.99%) in
2011, 17.0% (95% CI, 15.07%-19.12%) in 2012, and 16.9% (95% CI, 14.95%-19.03%) in 2013
from 12.7% (95% CI, 11.04%-14.53%) in 2003.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE During the 2003-2013 years, among adults aged 18
through 64 years, the percentage of nonmedical use of prescription opioids decreased. In
contrast, the prevalence of prescription opioid use disorders, frequency of use, and related
mortality increased.

Since 1999, the United States has experienced increases
in morbidity and mortality associated with nonmedi-
cal use of prescription opioids.1,2 During this period,
emergency department (ED) visits and drug overdose deaths
involving these drugs have increased rapidly.2-5 The preva-
lence of people aged 12 years or older who met Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-
IV) criteria for prescription opioid dependence increased from
0.4% in 2003 to 0.6% in 2013.6 Moreover, the estimated rates
of ED visits involving prescription opioids more than doubled
from 82.5 per 100 000 in 2004 to 184.1 per 100 000 in 2011.7
Furthermore, age-adjusted rates for drug-poisoning deaths in-
volving prescription opioids more than tripled from 1.4 per
100 000 population in 1999 to 5.1 in 2013.8 Also in 2013, pre-
scription opioids were involved in more deaths (>16 200) than
all illicit drugs combined (14 775).8 Due to these increases in
morbidity and mortality, prescription opioid abuse has be-
come a US epidemic.2,9,10
To fully understand the current status of the epidemic and
to examine who is currently most affected, an examination of
nationally representative US surveillance data is needed. To
further develop a detailed picture of the public health impli-
cations, we used 2 national data sets to examine trends in the
prevalence of nonmedical use of prescription opioids, pre-
scriptionopioidusedisorders,frequencyofuse,anddrugover-
dose deaths involving prescription opioids. Because nonel-
derly adults are the main population at risk of chronic
nonmedical use of prescription opioids and related morbid-
ityandmortality,11 thisstudyfocusedonadultsaged18through
64 years.
Methods
Data Sources
First, we examined data of adults who participated in the
2003-2013 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health
(NSDUH), which are conducted by the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). They pro-
vided nationally representative data on nonmedical use of pre-
scription opioids and use disorders among the civilian, non-
institutionalized population aged 12 years or older in the
United States. Excluded from NSDUH were persons without a
household address (eg, homeless persons not living in shel-
ters), active-duty military personnel, and institutional resi-
dents. The data collection protocol of the NSDUH was ap-
proved by the institutional review board at the Research
Triangle Institute (RTI) International. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from each study participant. The annual
mean weighted response rate of the 2003-2013 NSDUH was
66.3% (range, 60.2%-70.2%),12 according to the definition of
response rate 2 for in-person household surveys by the Ameri-
can Association for Public Opinion Research.13 Details regard-
ing NSDUH data collection are provided elsewhere.12
Second, we examined data from the 2003-2013 Multiple
CauseofDeathFilesfromtheNationalVitalStatisticsSystem.14
Drugoverdosedeathswerethoseassignedanunderlyingcause
ofdeathusingtheInternationalClassificationofDiseases,Tenth
Revision (ICD-10) codes X40-X44 (unintentional), X60-X64
(suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10-Y14 (undetermined in-
tent). Prescription opioid overdose deaths were those as-
signed specific ICD-10 codes T40.2-T40.4. Similar to NSDUH
analyses. We limited analyses to drug overdose deaths among
adults aged 18 through 64 years in the United States.
Measures
The NSDUH defined 12-month nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion opioids as use in the prior 12 months without a prescrip-
tion or as use with a prescription simply for the experience or
feeling caused by opioids.12 If respondents reported using pre-
scription opioids nonmedically in the past year, they were
asked to state the number of days they used them nonmedi-
cally. Consistent with previous work,11,15,16 we defined fre-
quent users as those with 100 days or more of nonmedical opi-
oid use in the past year and highly frequent users as those with
200 days or more. For persons reporting nonmedical prescrip-
tion opioid use, NSDUH collected sources of the medications,
including given by a friend or a relative for free, prescribed by
1 or more physicians, stolen from a friend or a relative, bought
from a friend or a relative, and bought from a drug dealer or
stranger. Age at first nonmedical use of prescription opioids
was also assessed (<18, 18-29, or 30 years).
TheNSDUHestimatedpast12-monthmajordepressiveepi-
sodes (MDE) and each specific substance use disorder (depen-
dence on or abuse of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, hallucino-
gens, heroin, inhalants, or nonmedical use of prescription pain
relievers, sedatives, or stimulants) based on assessments of in-
dividual diagnostic criteria from the DSM-IV.17 Nicotine de-
pendence among cigarette smokers was assessed using the
nicotine dependence syndrome scale.18
Sociodemographic characteristics from NSDUH data in-
cluded age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, em-
ployment status, marital status, health insurance, metropoli-
tan statistical area, census region, and year. Race/ethnicity was
NSDUH respondent's self-classification of racial and ethnic ori-
gin and identification based on the classifications developed
by the US Census Bureau. This study assessed race/ethnicity
becausepriorresearchindicatesracial/ethnicdifferencesinpre-
scription opioid­related mortality.5
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were conducted for persons aged 18 through 64
years. Between 2003 and 2013 for each examined year,
descriptive analyses were conducted to estimate the
12-month prevalence of nonmedical use of prescription opi-
oids and prescription opioid use disorders, the proportion of
12-month nonmedical opioid use initiates, the prevalence of
frequent users and highly frequent users, and the mean num-
ber of days of nonmedical use among adults and among non-
medical users. Similarly, we estimated trends in the rates of
overdose deaths involving prescription opioids between
2003 and 2013. For percentage estimates, bivariable logistic
regression models were applied to assess the unadjusted
annual prevalence, to test for differences between the 2003
estimate and the estimate in each year in 2004-2013 (using
PREDMARG and PRED_EFF statements in SUDAAN,19,20

2-sided t test with a significance level of .05), and to test
P values of  coefficients of the year variable. For mean num-
bers of days of nonmedical use, linear regression models
were applied to examine differences between the 2003 esti-
mate and the estimate in each year spanning 2004 through
2013 (using the REFLEVEL statement in SUDAAN,19 2-sided
t test with a significance level of .05) and to test P values of
 coefficients of the year variable. For drug overdose death
rates, 2-tailed z tests (with a significance level of .05)21 were
used to test differences between the 2003 rate and the rate in
each year spanning 2004 through 2013. A Bonferroni correc-
tion was used to reduce chances of type I errors of testing
overall trends. For each outcome, if the overall trend did not
meet the statistical significance threshold after the Bonfer-
roni correction, differences between the 2003 estimate and
the estimates in other years were not reported.
Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression modeling
were applied to assess unadjusted and model-adjusted rela-
tive risk (using PREDMARG and PRED_EFF statements in
SUDAAN19,20) for prescription opioid use disorders among
nonmedical opioid users. Because major depressive episodes
were unavailable in the 2003 NSDUH and because the source
of opioids was unavailable in 2003 and 2004 NSDUHs, sepa-
rate multivariable models were calculated for 2005-2013
with these additional variables included and for 2003-2013
without them. This study used SUDAAN software to account
for the complex sample design and sampling weights of
NSDUH data. Moreover, bivariable and multivariable zero-
truncated negative binomial regression models were applied
to examine factors associated with the number of days of
nonmedical use of prescription opioids among nonmedical
users. Stata statistical software22,23 was used for a zero-
truncated negative binomial regression function that
accounts for the complex sample design and sample weights
of NSDUH. Multicollinearity (using variance inflation factors)
and potential interaction effects between examined factors
were assessed and were not identified in final multivariable
models. Furthermore, for the prevalence of prescription opi-
oid use disorders among nonmedical opioid users, we con-
ducted tests for interaction effects for specific subgroup com-
parisons (eg, between non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic
blacks, between non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics, etc). To
test whether 2010 might be a pivotal year for the trends, we
repeated these analyses by using the year 2010 as the refer-
ence group and examined whether each intensity outcome
differed in each year spanning 2011 through 2013.
Results
Based on 472 200 sampled persons, we found that among
adults aged 18 through 64 years, the 12-month prevalence of
nonmedical use of prescription opioids decreased from 5.4%
(95% CI, 5.08%-5.70%) in 2003 to 4.9% (95% CI, 4.58%-
5.22%) in 2013 (absolute difference, -0.5%; 95% CI, -0.11% to
-0.89%), and the 12-month initiation rate decreased from
1.0% (95% CI, 0.86%-1.11%) in 2003 to 0.6% (95% CI, 0.52%-
0.71%) in 2013 (absolute difference, -0.4%; 95% CI, -0.52%
to -0.22%; Table 1). In contrast, the 12-month prevalence of
prescription opioid use disorders increased from 0.6% (95%
CI, 0.54%-0.76%) in 2003 to 0.9% (95% CI, 0.75%-1.01%) in
2013 (absolute difference, 0.3%; 95% CI, 0.03%-0.43%)
(Table 1 and eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The 12-month
prevalence of high-frequency use (200 days) also increased
from 0.3% (95% CI, 0.19%-0.35%) in 2003 to 0.4% (95% CI,
0.31%-0.48%) in 2013 (absolute difference, 0.1%; 95% CI,
0.01%-0.29%). The drug overdose death rates involving pre-
scription opioids increased from 4.5 per 100 000 (95% CI,
4.42-4.61) in 2003 to 7.8 per 100 000 (95% CI, 7.64-7.89) in
2013 (absolute difference 3.3, 95% CI, 3.09-3.41) (Table 1 and
eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Among users, the prevalence of prescription opioid use
disorders increased from 11.9% (95% CI, 10.13%-13.94%) in
2003 to 17.8% (95% CI, 15.50%-20.40%) in 2013 (absolute dif-
ference, 5.9%; 95% CI, 2.76%-9.05%). The prevalence of fre-
quent use (100 days) increased from 14.2% (95% CI, 12.17%-
16.49%) in 2003 to 19.3% (95% CI, 16.69%-21.88%) in 2013
(absolute difference, 5.1%; 95% CI, 1.67%-8.33%; Table 1).
The prevalence of high-frequency use (200 days) among
users increased from 5.0% (95% CI, 3.72%-6.66%) in 2003 to
8.2% (95% CI, 6.65%-10.01%) in 2013 (absolute difference,
3.2%; 95% CI, 1.04%-5.36%).
The mean number of days of nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion opioids increased from 2.1 (95% CI, 1.83-2.37) in 2003 to
2.6 (95% CI, 2.27-2.85) in 2013 (absolute difference, 0.5; 95%
CI, 0.05-0.86; Table 1). Among users, it increased from 40.0
days (95% CI, 35.43-44.57) in 2003 to 54.2 days (95% CI,
48.97-59.43) in 2013 (absolute difference, 14.2 days; 95% CI,
7.29-21.21).
Among users, the model-adjusted prevalence of having
prescription opioid use disorders was higher in each year dur-
ingthe2010-2013years:15.7%(95%CI,13.87%-17.67%)in2010,
16.1% (95% CI, 14.36%-17.99%) in 2011, 17.0% (95% CI, 15.07%-
19.12%) in 2012, and 16.9% (95% CI, 14.95%-19.03%) in 2013
than in 2003 (12.7%, 95% CI, 11.04%-14.53%; Table 2). More-
over, the model-adjusted prevalence was similar in each year
spanning 2011 through 2013 compared with 2010.
Consistent with Table 2 and based on the results of test-
ing for interactions for subgroup comparisons, compared with
non-Hispanic white users, both non-Hispanic blacks (P = .001)
and Hispanics (P = .006) had lower prevalence of prescrip-
tion opioid use disorders. The prevalence was lower among us-
ers with a college degree or beyond than among users with-
outahighschooldiploma(P < .001).Comparedwithuserswith
full-time employment, users who were disabled for work had
higher prevalence of the disorders (P < .001). The prevalence
was higher among users without health insurance (P = .008)
and among users with Medicaid (P < .001) than among users
with private health insurance only. Nonmedical users with
nicotinedependencehadhigherprevalenceofprescriptionopi-
oid use disorders than users without (P < .001). The preva-
lences among those with alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, hallu-
cinogen, heroin, stimulant, and sedative use disorders were
higher than users without the corresponding disorders (with
each subgroup comparison tested separately for interaction,
P < .001). With data from 2005-2013 NSDUHs, users with ma-

jor depressive episode had a higher prevalence of prescrip-
tion opioid use disorders than users without (P < .001); and
compared with users who obtained prescription opioids from
friends or relatives for free, users who stole or bought them
from friends or relatives, who were prescribed by physicians,
or who bought them from drug dealers or strangers had higher
prevalence of prescription opioid use disorders (with each sub-
group comparison tested separately for interaction, P < .001).
Among users, the mean number of days of nonmedical
use of prescription opioids was higher in every year span-
ning 2008 through 2013 than in 2003 (Table 3). The results
of the zero-truncated negative binominal regression model
show consistent results even after controlling for potential
confounding factors (adjusted incidence rate ratios [IRRs],
1.19-1.29). Users in 2010 had similar number of days of non-
medical use of prescription opioids compared with users in

each year spanning 2011 through 2013. Non-Hispanic black
users took prescription opioids nonmedically more often
than non-Hispanic white users (IRR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08-
1.39). Users with high school education or higher used pre-
scription opioids nonmedically less often than users with-
out a high school diploma (IRRs, 0.46-0.80). Users who
were disabled for work used prescription opioids nonmedi-
cally more often than users with full-time employment
(IRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.14-1.55). Users without health insurance
or users with Medicaid used prescription opioids nonmedi-
cally more often than users with private insurance only
(IRRs, 1.26-1.36).
Users with nicotine dependence used prescription opi-
oids nonmedically more often than users without (IRR, 1.54,
95% CI, 1.43-1.65). Users with cocaine, heroin, stimulant, and
sedative use disorders used prescription opioids nonmedi-
cally more often than users without the corresponding disor-
ders(IRRs,1.46-1.96).Themultivariablemodelbasedon2005-
2013 NSDUH data show that users who stole opioids from
friends or relatives, who were prescribed by physicians, and
who bought them from friends or relatives or from drug deal-
ers or strangers used prescription opioids nonmedically more
often than users who obtained prescription opioids from
friends or relatives for free (IRRs, 1.28-2.81).
Discussion
Using nationally representative data, we found during years
2003 through 2013, among adults aged 18 through 64 years,
the percentage of nonmedical use of prescription opioids de-
creased.However,wefoundseveralmeasuresofhigh-risknon-
medical prescription opioid use that either increased or per-
sistedthrough2013.Specifically,wefoundsignificantincreases
in high-intensity prescription opioid use (measured by both
prevalence of prescription opioid use disorders and high fre-
quency of use) among nonmedical prescription opioid users
in each year from 2010 through 2013 compared with those in
2003, even after controlling for potential confounding fac-
tors. Furthermore, when compared with those in 2010, addi-
tional analyses at bivariable and multivariable levels consis-
tently showed that both intensity outcomes did not decrease
in any year from 2011 through 2013. These national increases
alsoparalleledtheincreasesinprescriptionopioid-relatedover-
dose death rates in the United States identified in our study
using a separate national data set. These results are consis-
tent with persistent high-risk nonmedical use among adults
through at least 2013. The significant increases in high-
intensity (and therefore especially high-risk) prescription opi-
oid use contrast a slight downward trend in the overall per-
centage of nonmedical use.
A recent study, using indicators from the Researched
Abuse, Diversion, and Addiction-Related Surveillance
(RADARS) System, found that the abuse and diversion of
prescription opioids increased between 2002 and 2010 and
plateaued or decreased between 2011 and 2013.24 RADARS
provides proprietary, nonnationally representative data but
does not aim to estimate prevalence.24,25 For example, not
all parts of the United States have prescription drug diver-
sion agencies, and operational details and emphases of
diversion agencies vary according to the needs of the com-
munity and local drug activity.24,25 Since the completeness

and accuracy of RADARS is difficult to ascertain, the nation-
ally representative results in our study may be especially
important in providing an accurate picture of the current
status of the epidemic.
The epidemic has evolved over time. The increases in the
prevalenceofadultswithprescriptionopioidusedisordersand
high-frequency use identified in our study are a major public
health concern. Furthermore, the increases in high-intensity
prescription opioid use occurred in the context of increased
prescribing of prescription opioids.15 Previous studies have
shown a strong relationship between inappropriate opioid pre-
scribing and negative health outcomes.26 The percentage of
prescription opioid users who used an opioid stronger than

years 1999 through 2002 to 80.0% in the years 2011 through
2012.27 Also, usage of higher amounts of prescription opioids
is a significant risk factor for overdose death.28
We identified characteristics associated with 2 intensity
outcomes that may help clinicians detect problematic pre-
scription opioid use and use disorders and eventually
reduce morbidity and mortality involving prescription opi-
oids alone or in combinations with other drugs. For
example, users with sedative use disorders were at the high-
est risk of both intensity outcomes, which may help explain
the increasing morbidity and mortality due to prescription
opioid and benzodiazepine use.29 Users who were disabled
for work and users with Medicaid health insurance coverage
were at higher risk of both intensity outcomes, which were
consistent with previous studies showing that these popula-
tions were more likely to be prescribed and to use prescrip-
tion opioids in higher-risk ways and were at increased risk
of opioid-related mortality.30 These results can be incorpo-
rated into clinician training programs to facilitate effective
identification and interventions for high-risk nonmedical
users of prescription opioids. Moreover, clinicians can use
prescription drug­monitoring programs31,32 to identify pat-
terns of inappropriate receipt of prescription opioids and
screen and treat patients with prescription opioid use disor-
ders as well as other associated specific substance use disor-
ders, nicotine dependence, and depression.
Receiving treatment for substance use disorders is par-
ticularly critical. Most adults with prescription opioid use dis-
orders or other substance use disorders neither receive treat-
ment nor perceive a need for treatment.33 In 2013, more than
three-fourths of adults aged 18 through 64 years who had pre-
scription opioid use disorders did not receive any substance
use treatment.6 Particularly, policy and societal barriers pre-
vent broad dissemination, access, and adoption of highly ef-
fective medication-assisted therapies for people with prescrip-
tion opioid use disorders.2,10,33
This study has several limitations. First, the cross-
sectional nature of NSDUH data precludes drawing causal

a The 2003-2004 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) did not
measure the source of prescription opioids. However, this variable is
significantly associated with the number of days of nonmedical use of
prescription opioids in the past 12 months. The presented results for Source of
Prescription Opioids are based on a model using just the 2005-2013 NSDUH
data after controlling for other covariates showing in Table 3. The rest of the
results are from the 2003-2013 sample (sample size = 38 000). The
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration requires that
any description of overall sample sizes based on the restricted-use data files
has to be rounded to the nearest 100, which intends to minimize potential
disclosure risk.
b Each day of use is considered a separate occurrence and was counted once in
calculating the adjusted incidence rate ratio.23
c Within each factor, a model-predicted number of days of nonmedical use of
prescription opioids that significantly differs from the model-predicted
number of days of the reference group. The variables in the Methods section
but not presented in Table 3 (eg, marital status and metropolitan statistical
area) were not significantly associated with the outcome at the multivariable
level. However, final models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
education regardless of statistical significance.

inferences from reported associations. Second, except for
the results on drug overdose deaths involving prescription
opioids, our results only applied to the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized population because NSDUH does not cover insti-
tutionalized populations, homeless people not living in shel-
ters, and active-duty military personnel. Third, although
methods to assess nonresponse bias vary and each has its
limitations,34,35 the SAMHSA compared NSDUH estimates
with other population surveys such as the Monitoring the
Future, the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System, the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey, and the National Health Interview
Survey. The SAMHSA found comparable trends even though
the estimates themselves differ in magnitude (mostly due to
differences in survey designs).36,37 For example, NSDUH and
Monitoring the Future trends in nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion opioids, cigarette use, and alcohol use between 2003
and 2013 showed consistent patterns.37 Fourth, NSDUH is a
self-report survey and is subject to recall bias. Fifth, approxi-
mately 25% of drug overdose death certificates did not
specify the type of drugs involved in the death on the death
certificate. The death rates reported in this study may be
underestimated.38
Despite these limitations, we found a significangt de-
crease in the precentage of nonmedical use of prescription opi-
oids, as well as significant increases in the prevalence of pre-
scriptionopioidusedisorders,high-frequencyuse,andrelated
mortality among adults aged 18 through 64 years in the United
States over the past decade. Furthermore, the increases iden-
tified in this study occurred in the context of increasing heroin
use and heroin-related overdose deaths in the United States,39
supporting a need to address nonmedical use of prescription
opioid and heroin abuse in a coordinated and comprehensive
manner.31,33,40
Conclusions
During the 2003-2013 years, among adults aged 18 through 64
years,thepercentageofnonmedicaluseofprescriptionopioids
decreased.Incontrast,theprevalenceofprescriptionopioiduse
disorders, frequency of use, and related mortality increased.
