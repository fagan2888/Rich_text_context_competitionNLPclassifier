posterior cruciate ligament:
A 7-year follow-up study
Rui Wang, Bin Xu, Lei Wu and Honggang Xu
Abstract
Objective: Arthroscopy is the most popular technique in posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)
reconstruction surgery. However, no consensus on long-term outcomes after arthroscopic PCL
reconstruction has been reached. This study was performed to evaluate the long-term outcomes
after arthroscopic autologous hamstring or allogeneic tendon single-bundle reconstruction of
the PCL.
Methods: Fifty-eight patients who underwent arthroscopic PCL reconstruction in Anhui, China
from 2007 to 2009 were included. The follow-up period ranged from 56 to 83 months. During
the follow-up, the Lysholm knee score and Tegner activity score were used to assess knee
function. The KT-2000 arthrometer (MEDmetric Corp., San Diego, CA, USA) was used to
assess the stability of the reconstructed PCL.
Results: The mean Lysholm score, mean Tegner score, and mean forward and backward dis-
placements were not significantly different between the final follow-up and 1 year after the
surgery. Additionally, no significant differences were observed in any of the above-mentioned
parameters between autologous and allogeneic reconstruction at the final follow-up.
Conclusion: Both autologous and allogeneic reconstruction had few complications and satis-
factory long-term outcomes.

Introduction
The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is
one of the most important structures in
the maintenance of stability and can pre-
vent excessive rotation of the knee.1 After
injury, PCL recovery takes an extremely
long time. Previous studies have demon-
strated that injury of the PCL increases
knee instability, leading to articular carti-
lage damage, meniscus injury, and osteoar-
thritis.2­4 In general, the incidence of PCL
injury is lower than that of anterior cruciate
ligament (ACL) injury because PCL injury
occurs only when the knee is bent at the
time the trauma occurs. However, in the
areas of uneven terrain in Eastern China
and rural regions of this part of the country,
simple PCL injuries are very common, with
most injuries caused by motorbike traffic
accidents. For decades, arthroscopy has
been the most popular technique in PCL
reconstruction because of its various advan-
tages, including a small incision and wide
field of vision. However, different studies
of long-term outcomes after arthroscopic
PCL reconstruction have reported disparate
results without uniform findings.5,6 For
example, some patients showed no distinct
improvement in knee stability after sur-
gery.4 To clarify this issue, the present
study investigated the long-term outcomes
in 58 patients who underwent arthroscopic
PCL reconstruction from 2007 to 2009 in
our hospital.
Methods
Patients
This case series is reported in line with the
PROCESS guidelines.7 The patients includ-
ed in this study were hospitalized in the
Department of Sport Injury and
Arthroscopy of the First Affiliated
Hospital of Anhui Medical University
from 2007 to 2009. This study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the
First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical
University, and all patients provided writ-
ten informed consent for publication of
their information. The same surgeon per-
formed all of the surgeries using the same
fixation material such as plates and screws.
Another doctor in the same department
who did not participate in the surgeries per-
formed the follow-up. The follow-up was
conducted by a doctor­patient double-
blind experiment.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
PCL injury was diagnosed by the following
criteria: (1) demonstration of PCL disconti-
nuity on magnetic resonance imaging, (2) a
positive posterior drawer test and tibia
sinking test, (3) a >10-mm backward shift
of the tibia as measured by a KT-2000
arthrometer (MEDmetric Corp., San
Diego, CA, USA), and (4) willingness to
undergo arthroscopic minimally invasive
surgery.
Patients were excluded from this study if
they had multiple ligament injuries caused
by knee dislocation; no trauma history;
combined osteoarthritis, rheumatism, or
rheumatoid arthritis; severe heart, brain,
or kidney disease; or severe surgical incision
site infection.
Among the study group, 41 patients
underwent 4-strand autogenous semitendi-
nosus reconstruction, and the remaining 17
patients underwent deep hypothermia allo-
geneic tendon reconstruction.
Surgical procedure
In all patients, a standard anteromedial or
anterolateral operative approach was used
to treat intra-articular hyperplasia, hyper-
trophy, and congestion of the synovial
membrane. During the surgery, the PCL
was confirmed to be fractured or nearly
fractured (i.e., >70% of the PCL was
866 Journal of International Medical Research 46(2)
ruptured, the remaining fibers lacked elas-
ticity, and the intraoperative posterior
drawer test was positive). In patients with
a torn meniscus, the meniscus was sutured
or partially dissected. In 23 patients who
underwent 4-strand autogenous semitendi-
nosus reconstruction, an oblique incision
about 3 to 4 cm long was made 2 cm from
the medial border of the tibial tuberosity.
The fascia was then slit, and the attachment
of the pes anserinus was separated. Using a
tendon lifter for assistance, the semitendi-
nosus tendon and gracilis tendon were
removed and neatly trimmed. The tendons
were sutured using nonabsorbable
sutures (W4843, ETHIBONDTM; Ethicon,
Somerville, NJ, USA) and woven into a 12-
cm-long tendon graft with a diameter of
8 to 9 mm. In the 11 patients who under-
went deep hypothermia allogeneic tendon
reconstruction, the tendons were soaked in
saline containing vancomycin (1000 mg/L)
at room temperature for 30 min and then
pretensioned at 80 N. The tendons were
then sutured and woven as described
above. When the diameter of the tendon
graft was <8 mm, the suture density was
increased to 8 mm in diameter. The remain-
ing attachment of the PCL, 5 mm away
from the margin of the articular cartilage,
was taken as the positioning point. The
patient's knee was bent to an angle of
100 to 110, and a guide pin was placed.
A hollow drill (diameter of 4.5 mm) was
used to measure the length of the femoral
tunnel. An appropriate hollow drill was
then selected to enlarge the tunnel accord-
ing to the length and diameter of the graft.
The devitalized tissue was removed, and
only the tibial attachment point of the
PCL was retained. After selecting a point
18 to 25 mm from the lower side of the
tibial plateau as the positioning point, the
tibial tunnel was prepared using a tibial
locator according to the length and diame-
ter of the graft. Finally, using a traverse
device for assistance, the graft was placed
into the femoral tunnel and tibial tunnel.
The tendon was then strengthened at a posi-
tion of 60 using the anterior drawer test,
and the tibia was fixed using an interface
screw (Smith & Nephew, London, UK).
The femoral tendon graft was fixed by a
flip-button plate. The tibial tunnel tendon
graft stump was sutured with wire anchors
(Smith & Nephew). After washing the joint
cavity, the incisions were closed with pres-
sure bandages.
After surgery, each patient's knee was
immobilized with a chuck brace, and each
patient was advised about the need for lim-
ited weight bearing during ambulation. A
cold compress was used to cover the surgi-
cal area, and the patients were encouraged
to perform quadriceps isometric contrac-
tion training. Two to 4 weeks after the sur-
gery (and for the following 2 months), the
patients were allowed to slowly bend their
knee to a 90 angle. They were permitted to
try to bend their knee 120 only when the
posterior drawer test was negative. Limited
weight bearing on the affected limb was
permitted, depending on the recovery of
the quadriceps. Competitive sports were
prohibited for the first 6 months after the
surgery and for as long as the first 9 months
in patients who had undergone allogeneic
tendon reconstruction.
Data collection
All patients' Lysholm knee score, Tegner
activity score, and KT-2000 measurements
were assessed before the surgery; 3, 6, and
12 months after the surgery; and at the final
follow-up. The Lysholm score consists of
eight questions assessing joint instability
after knee ligament reconstruction, and
scores of 70 to 100 points indicate that
knee function is significantly affected. The
reliability, effectiveness, and sensitivity of
this score have been internationally recog-
nized. The Tegner activity score is often
associated with the Lysholm score and
Wang et al. 867
corresponds to the patient's activity level,
especially the level of activity of a particular
exercise type; the total possible score is
10 points. The KT-2000 measurements indi-
cate the distance between the two tibias
before and after a movement. These meas-
urements represent a new auxiliary means
for the diagnosis of cruciate ligament
injury and efficacy evaluation.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative data are shown as mean
Æ standard deviation. Differences among
more than two groups were assessed by
two-way analysis of variance followed by
the post-hoc Student's t-test, and differen-
ces between two groups were assessed with
Student's t-test. A P value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Patient demographics
The clinical and functional outcomes are
summarized in Table 1. The follow-up
duration ranged from 56 to 83 months.
The final study group comprised 58 patients
(32 male, 26 female) aged 16 to 59 years
(mean age, 32.02 Æ 10.24 years). Among
these 58 patients, 39 had injured their
right knee and 19 had injured their left
knee. Traffic accidents (n ¼ 28) were the
most common cause of the injuries, fol-
lowed by sports-related injuries (n ¼ 18)
and falling-related injuries (n ¼ 12). Eleven
patients had a combined meniscus injury,
and four patients had a combined articular
cartilage injury. The average interval from
the time of injury to treatment was
6.72 Æ 2.95 months (range, 2­13 months).
One-year postoperative follow-up results
At the 1-year postoperative clinical obser-
vation, the Lysholm scores of 35 patients
were >90. Fifteen patients had Lysholm
scores of 80 to 90, and six patients had
Lysholm scores of 60 to 80. Two patients
had Lysholm scores of <60. The mean
Lysholm score was 87.68 (Table 2). The
Tegner scores of 40 patients were
>8 points, and 15 patients had scores of 6
to 8 points. The remaining three patients

Tegner score was 8.0 (Table 2). In 31
patients, the anterior-posterior shift as mea-
sured by the KT-2000 was <2 mm. In 17
patients, the displacement was 2 to 5 mm,
and in 7 patients, it was 5 to 10 mm. In
three patients, the displacement was >10
mm. The mean forward and backward dis-
placement was 3.18 mm (Table 2).
Final follow-up results
All patients underwent a comprehensive
assessment at the final follow-up. In 34
patients, the Lysholm score was >90; in
16 patients, it was 80 to 90; and in 5
patients, it was 60 to 80. Only three patients
had a Lysholm score of <60. The mean
Lysholm score was 85.38 (Table 2). In 39
patients, the Tegner score was >8; in 15
patients, it was 6 to 8; and in 4 patients, it
was <6. The mean Tegner score was 7.7
(Table 2). Forward and backward displace-
ment was <2 mm in 29 patients, 2 to 5 mm
in 20 patients, 5 to 10 mm in 6 patients, and
>10 mm in 3 patients. The mean forward
and backward displacement was 4.07 mm
(Table 2). None of the above-mentioned
parameters were significantly different
between autologous and allogeneic recon-
struction at the final follow-up (Table 3).
In addition, no significant differences were
observed in the mean Lysholm score, mean
Tegner score, or mean forward and back-
ward displacement at the final follow-up
compared with at 1 year after the surgery
(Table 2).
Discussion
Arthroscopic PCL reconstruction is one of
the most common surgical options for PCL
injury.8,9 Although this procedure has been
carried out extensively in recent years,
increasing evidence suggests that the long-
term prognosis may be unsatisfactory, with
recurrent laxity and knee instability being
much more common in PCL than ACL
reconstruction. This has been attributed to
the "killer turn" formed when preparing the
tibial tunnel,10 in which the tendon graft
forms an acute angle and scratches the
sub-tibial cortical bone.11 The friction can
lead to tendon graft injury and affect the
creeping substitution by bone marrow mes-
enchymal cells and fibroblasts. No effective
solution to this problem has been identified
to date. To reduce the friction, some
researchers have made a secondary incision
behind the articular cavity and anchored
the tendon graft to the intra-articular
tibial tunnel opening with an interface
screw.12 However, this resulted in no obvi-
ous improvement compared with tradition-
al PCL reconstruction. In the present study,
a PCL tibial locator was used to help create
the tibial tunnel opening 1.8 to 2.0 cm
below the surface of the tibial plateau, and
the angle between the tunnel and tibial pla-
teau was adjusted to 50 to 60 to reduce
wear of the tendon graft. The dual-fixation
method was employed to further reduce
postoperative displacement of the tendon
graft; i.e., an absorbable interference screw
was placed in the tunnel, and the tendon
graft stump was anchored to expose the
tunnel outside. The postoperative follow-
up examination confirmed that this
method achieved a more satisfactory clini-
cal outcome, including improved recovery
of the motor function of the knee.

In healthy adults, the anatomical diame-
ter of the PCL is 11 to 13 mm, which is
much larger than that of the ACL.
However, the diameter of the four strands
of the hamstring tendon is only 7 to 9 mm,
which is much smaller than that of the PCL.
Some researchers have advocated deep
hypothermia allograft reconstruction to
maintain the tension and strength of
tendon grafts in the period shortly after
PCL reconstruction.13 However, deep
hypothermia allograft reconstruction leads
to different degrees of graft rejection and
affects the creeping substitution by bone
marrow mesenchymal cells and fibro-
blasts.13 Other researchers have asserted
that tendon grafts with a diameter of
<8 mm are not suitable for PCL recon-
struction because they aggravate the fric-
tion caused by the "killer turn."13
To prevent reconstruction failure caused
by thin tendon grafts in the present study,
we wove the unabsorbed sutures with the
tendon grafts to ensure that the diameter
of the tendon grafts was >8 mm. Three of
the 17 patients who underwent deep hypo-
thermia allograft reconstruction developed
knee joint swelling, which was relieved by
treatment with a steroid; no other severe
complications occurred. All three patients
recovered well. Furthermore, the knee func-
tion scores of the patients who underwent
allograft reconstruction showed little differ-
ence from those of patients who underwent
autologous reconstruction. These findings
were likely due to the firm fixation of the
graft, increased angle of the "killer turn,"
and relatively conservative rehabilitation
exercises.
The recovery time after PCL reconstruc-
tion is much longer than that after ACL
reconstruction. The appropriateness of
encouraging patients to perform knee flex-
ion function training as soon as possible
after surgery is controversial.14 We believe
that the performance of training exercises
to strengthen quadriceps isometric
contraction in the early postoperative
period could improve the ligament balance
and muscle strength around the joint.
However, to reduce the negative effects of
early postoperative graft tendon creeping
substitution and the friction that occurs
when the tendon grafts grow into the
tibia, we were very conservative in limiting
the patients' early knee flexion: the patients
could bend their knee to 90 1 month after
surgery and continue to maintain this angle
during the next month. Two months after
surgery, after completing the outpatient
review and determining that no obvious
lower limb muscle atrophy was present
and that the muscle strength had been
restored well, the patients could try to
bend their knee to 120. In this study, the
mean forward and backward displacement
of the tibia was satisfactory after healing of
the tendon allografts 1 year postoperative-
ly. Additionally, no patients showed signif-
icant knee injury after surgery and were
able to independently complete all of their
daily work after performing strengthening
exercises for the patella and low-
frequency, low-intensity knee training.
In addition to knee flexion functional
training, the following factors can affect
patients' postoperative outcomes: graft
size, postoperative compliance with rehabil-
itation exercise, postoperative adherence to
medical advice, patient's occupation,
reduced bone mass, and reduced muscle
power around the knee joint, especially
the quadriceps femoris.
The single-bundle reconstruction of the
cruciate ligament using hamstring tendons
or allogeneic tendons performed in the pre-
sent study has been the main surgical
method for nearly 20 years. According to
the literature, this method is also commonly
applied worldwide.15 The patient's condi-
tion is evaluated prior to the use of alloge-
neic tendons, and all patients are required
to provide written informed consent.
Although serious complications such as
870 Journal of International Medical Research 46(2)
joint infection and graft rejection are possi-
ble, no such complications were observed in
the present study. However, as noted in
some studies, the healing of tendon allog-
rafts containing bone marrow is relatively
slow.16 Thus, the postoperative rehabilita-
tion program in such patients is somewhat
conservative. In the present study, as shown
by the long-term follow-up results, there
were no significant differences between
patients treated with allogeneic versus
autologous tendon allografts. A flip-
button plate with absorbable screws was
the most common method used to fix the
graft. Many reports on the use of this
method have been published in recent
years.17,18
However, there were still some sources of
selection bias in the present study because
of the patients' social, economic, and
cultural statuses. During the long-term
follow-up, patients with a poor or low
socioeconomic level showed poor adherence
to the rehabilitation program and failed to
give feedback to doctors during the tele-
phone and outpatient follow-ups. Patients
who did not complete the follow-up were
excluded from the final analysis. Some
patients' lack of appreciation of the value
of the postoperative rehabilitation affected
the positive feedback as well as frequency
and quality of communication with the doc-
tors, especially with respect to the patients'
knee scores. Such selection bias cannot be
circumvented.
As in other studies,16,19,20 anterior-
posterior shifting of >5 mm still occurred
in the present study. In some cases, the
anterior-posterior shifting was >10 mm.
In one of the five patients with anterior-
posterior shifting of 5 to 10 mm, the dis-
placement had expanded to 10 mm at the
final follow-up. Furthermore, three patients
with original displacements of >10 mm
showed no improvement in the degree of
displacement at the final follow-up. These
results illustrate that the measures we
adopted played a limited role in preventing
long-term recurrent relaxation of the recon-
structed PCL. We have since performed an
animal experiment to investigate this
problem.
In conclusion, the results of the present
study showed few complications and satis-
factory long-term outcomes for both autol-
ogous and allogeneic reconstruction. We
hope that these findings can help to pro-
mote postoperative recovery following
PCL reconstruction and reduce recurrent
relaxation.
