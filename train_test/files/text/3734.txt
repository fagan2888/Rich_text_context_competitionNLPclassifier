Introduction
The possible associations of physical activity and exercise
with cognitive functioning and academic performance in
children and adolescents has been increasingly investigated
in recent years (Donnelly et al., 2016; Haapala et al., 2016;
Hillman, Erickson, & Hatfield, 2017; Van der Niet, Hartman,
Smith, & Visscher, 2014). Although there has been research
performed on this topic for many years (see, for example,
Ayres, 1965), the renewed interest may be caused by concern
that today's children do not maintain appropriate levels of
physical activity and physical fitness (Tremblay et al., 2011),
and there have also been reports of declining motor compe-
tence (Bardid, Rudd, Lenoir, Polman, & Barnett, 2015;
Kambas et al., 2012). Despite the known benefits to health
outcomes (Janssen & LeBlanc, 2010; Timmons et al., 2012),
evidence suggests that many children do not meet the recom-
mended amount of daily physical activity (Kolle, Steene-
Johannessen, Andersen, & Anderssen, 2010; Verloigne et al.,
2012). In addition, evaluation of education systems world-
wide by testing children's skills and knowledge in important
key subjects may have increased the focus on academic
results and efforts to improve the educational systems (The
Programme for International Student Assessment [PISA]).
Several mechanisms related to changes in brain structure
and cognitive function have been discussed when explaining
the possible effects of physical activity on brain health in
children (for a complete overview, see reviews by Donnelly
et al., 2016; Hillman et al., 2017; Voelcker-Rehage &
Niemann, 2013). The constructs of physical activity, physi-
cal fitness, cardiovascular fitness, and motor competence are
interrelated, but the results indicate that these different
aspects of exercise and activity are differently associated
with the brain structure, cognition, and function (Haapala,
2013; Voelcker-Rehage & Niemann, 2013). Higher physical
fitness and higher cardiovascular fitness in children has been
related to a larger volume of the subcortical structures such

Associations of Physical Fitness and Motor
Competence With Reading Skills in 9-
and 12-Year-Old Children: A Longitudinal
Study

Abstract
This longitudinal study explores the association of motor competence and physical fitness with reading skills in children
aged 9 and 12 years. Sixty-seven children aged 9 years completed an assessment of motor competence (measured using
the Movement Assessment battery for Children), physical fitness (assessed using the Test of Physical Fitness), and reading
(measured using the Wordchain test). The testing procedures were repeated after 32 months. For the 9-year-old group,
there was a low, negative correlation between motor competence and reading overall, r = -.031 (girls: r = -.207; boys: r =
.180). Correlation between fitness and reading was also low (r = .064). Girls had a higher correlation between fitness and
reading than boys (r = .404; 17.7% shared variance, vs. r = -.138). When the children were 12 years old, there was still a low
association of motor competence and fitness with reading. These low associations can be used to support the task specificity
principles of learning.

as the basal ganglia and hippocampus (Chaddock et al.,
2010, 2012); additional evidence suggests that children who
are more fit have a higher integrity of white matter micro-
structure and cortical thickness (see Hillman et al., 2017).
These structures are related to the modulation of executive
control such as inhibition, memory, cognitive flexibility, and
attention, which are cognitive operations that often are
referred to as "gate keepers" to learning and academic
achievement (Voelcker-Rehage & Niemann, 2013).
More recently, studies on the association between motor
coordination and cognitive function in children have emerged
(Haapala et al., 2015; Van der Fels et al., 2014), but the link
between this kind of research and specific brain structures
and functions is unclear. According to Koutsandréou,
Wegner, Niemann, and Budde (2016), improvement of the
working memory is significantly better for children undergo-
ing motor exercise compared with a cardiovascular exercise
training group and a control group. It is suggested that coor-
dination and motor skill learning taps into the neurophysio-
logical motor system to a greater extent than the metabolic
processes involved in fitness and physical activity, and that
this has specific mechanistic effects on the brain structure
and function via influence of the neural synapses and net-
work (Koutsandréou et al., 2016; Voelcker-Rehage &
Niemann, 2013). The underlying mechanisms that are differ-
ent between types of physical activity and brain structure/
function are diverse and complex, and they are beyond the
scope of the present study.
Reading is a skill that, in many societies, will determine
success because decoding of written text to attain meaning is
a prerequisite to gain knowledge from books. The reading
process presupposes the graphemic encoding of visually pre-
sented words that in turn is recoded into speech and meaning
is activated in semantic memory corresponding to compre-
hension (Revlin, 2013).At some point in the reading process,
there is a need to recognize individual words. Word decoding
can be defined as "the accurate and fast retrieval of the pho-
nological code for written word forms" (Verhoeven, 2011, p.
38) and has a central role in children's reading development
(Stanovich, 2000). Age differences are intuitively present in
reading, but sex differences are also found; girls display bet-
ter general reading comprehension compared with boys
(Mullis, Martin, Kennedy, & Foy, 2007). Sex differences are
also observed in word processing because physiological evi-
dence reveals differences in event-related field patterns dur-
ing word recognition, that is, more strength of activation and
involvement of different neural structures in women (see, for
overview, Walla, Hufnagl, Lindinger, Deecke, & Lang,
2001). Walla et al. (2001) suggested that in females, both
hemispheres are equally involved in word processing com-
pared with males where the left hemisphere is more involved,
that is, hemispheric asymmetry. However, researchers have
also suggested that there is a strong influence of sex hor-
mones on cognitive functions (Kimura, 1996) and cerebral
lateralization (Geschwind & Galaburda, 1985). In this
respect, Geschwind and Galaburda (1985) argued that testos-
terone slows down the development of the left hemisphere
during prenatal period. This causes difference in abilities
between the genders, girls being superior in verbal abilities.
Caspersen, Powell, and Christenson (1985, p. 128)
defined physical fitness as a set of inherent or achieved per-
sonal attributes that relate to the ability to perform physical
activity. Physical fitness is a multifaceted concept, and some
fitness components included in this term seem to be espe-
cially important markers of various health outcomes in
young people, namely cardiorespiratory fitness, flexibility,
muscular fitness, and speed/agility (Ortega, Ruiz, Castillo, &
Sjøstøm, 2008). Muscular fitness is the capacity to perform
work against resistance, while speed and agility is the ability
to move quickly and change direction of the body rapidly
and in a controlled way (Gallahue & Ozmun, 2006).
Cardiorespiratory fitness is the overall capacity of the cardio-
vascular, respiratory, and skeletal muscle system to use oxy-
gen for energy production, and it has been positively
associated with cognition and brain health. Castelli, Hillman,
Buck, and Erwin (2007) found that a higher aerobic fitness
performance (measured by Pacer, 20-m shuttle run) was pos-
itively related to reading achievement (p < .001) among chil-
dren in the third and fifth grades. Children with a higher
cardiovascular fitness are also found to perform better com-
pared with their less-fit peers in executive function processes
(e.g., memory, attention, and inhibitory control; Chaddock
et al., 2010; Hillman, Erickson, & Kramer, 2008), supporting
the findings that executive functioning is a mediator of the
relationship between physical fitness and academic achieve-
ment (Van der Niet et al., 2014). Moreover, a higher fitness
level in children affects the speed of the neuroelectric
responses associated with specific language processing abili-
ties (Scudder et al., 2014). In contrast, Haapala et al. (2015)
found no association between cardiovascular performance
(assessed by a maximal exercise test with cycle ergometer)
and academic skills. Similarly, Kantomaa et al. (2013) did
not find any association between cardiovascular fitness and
grade-point average in adolescents. Moreover, van der Niet
et al. (2014) showed that the different measures included in
physical fitness (including 20-m shuttle run, 10 × 5-m shuttle
run, sit-ups, and standing broad jump) correlated differently
with the academic outcomes of interest (mathematics, read-
ing, and spelling). For example, standing broad jump had
highest correlations to academic performance, then 20-m
shuttle run, 10 × 5-m shuttle run, while sit-ups had the lowest
correlation. Other fitness components, such as muscle fitness
and flexibility, did not relate to academic achievement (gen-
eral academic achievement, reading, and mathematics;
Castelli et al., 2007). In addition, an intervention study by
Bassin and Breihan (1978) found no significant improve-
ments (p > .05) in reading achievement after a period of
exposure (3 times a week, in ½-hr sessions during a 20-week
period) to different motor activities (including coordination
and rhythm, agility, speed, strength, flexibility, balance, and
Sigmundsson et al. 3
endurance) among children in the second grade compared
with a control group and an experimental group.
Motor competence can be defined as an individual's level
of performance when executing different motor acts (Burton
& Rodgerson, 2001; Henderson & Sugden, 1992;
Sigmundsson & Haga, 2016), and the term encompasses
both fine and gross motor skills/activities. When measuring
motor competence, typical aspects in focus are balance/pos-
tural control, speed, sureness, and accuracy of movement
coordination. Compared with the health-related components
found in physical fitness, test items on motor competence
tests demand little muscular strength or endurance, and aero-
bic performance (Fjørtoft, Pedersen, Sigmundsson, &
Vereijken, 2003; Haga, 2009). Motor competence was shown
to influence several aspects in a child's development, includ-
ing psychosocial factors (e.g., self-esteem; Vedul-Kjesås,
Sigmundsson, Stensdotter, & Haga, 2012), probability of
participation in a physical activity (Holfelder & Schott,
2014), overall performance on different fitness components
(Haga, 2008; Rivilis et al., 2011), and the degree of excessive
weight and obesity (D'Hondt et al., 2013; Hendrix, Prins, &
Dekkers, 2014). More recently, motor competence has been
studied in relation to cognitive function and academic per-
formance in children. Haapala et al. (2015) highlighted how
different measures of motor performance are not equally
linked to cognition in children, because better cognition
(measured by Raven Colored Progressive Matrices) was sig-
nificantly associated with better overall motor performance
(calculated as the sum of shuttle run, balance, and manual
dexterity) and better performance in the shuttle run test and
balance test (modified flamingo balance test), but not with
standing long jump, 15-m sprint, and manual dexterity in the
entire sample. Similar findings were also reported by Haapala
et al. (2014), because children with a lower performance,
that is, results in the lowest third, in overall motor perfor-
mance, shuttle run, and manual dexterity in Grade 1 had sig-
nificantly worse reading fluency and arithmetic skills
compared with children with higher performance in motor
competence, while no such association was found between
balance and academic performance.
Intervention studies that investigated the effects of motor
skills and physical activity (measured by Motor Skills
Development as Ground for Learning (MUGI) that specially
focused on balance and coordination) on school performance
for a period of 9 years revealed better marks (Swedish,
English, and mathematics) in the intervention group than the
control group (p < .05), and a larger proportion from the
intervention group qualified for upper secondary school.
However, both these associations were found for boys but
not for girls (Ericsson & Karlsson, 2012). Results also indi-
cate that participating in an exercise program focusing on
bimanual coordination activities can contribute to improved
reading comprehension (p < .05), but not decoding (p > .05;
measured using the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test) in chil-
dren from 10 to 11 years of age (Uhrich & Swalm, 2007).
Although the evidence is still vague and insufficient, there
might be some indications of a reduction in the strength of
the association between motor skills and cognitive skills in
pubertal children (greater than 13 years of age) compared
with prepubertal children, and that this might be explained
by a more separate development in these two domains as
they get older (Van der Fels et al., 2014).
Thus, exploring the relative contribution of the different
components included in these two different constructs (e.g.,
aerobic and muscular fitness and manual dexterity, hand­eye
coordination, and balance) on cognitive skills could there-
fore contribute to a more comprehensive picture of the pos-
sible mechanisms (Castelli et al., 2007). A longitudinal
design could also provide a better understanding of these
possible processes during development (Hillman et al., 2017;
Hillman et al., 2008). The purpose of this study was therefore
to explore the possible associations of physical fitness and
motor competence with reading skills in children aged 9 and
12 years.
Method
Study Design and Participants
Sixty-seven school children aged 9 to 10 years (the total popu-
lation in that age group in the school selected) completed
assessments of motor competence (Movement Assessment
Battery for Children [MABC]; Henderson & Sugden, 1992),
physical fitness (Test of Physical Fitness [TPF]; Fjørtoft,
Pedersen, Sigmundsson, & Vereijken, 2011), and reading
(Word Recognition Test [WCT]; Høien & Tønnesen, 1997).
The entire sample (N = 67, 31 girls and 36 boys) was obtained
from a local mainstream primary school in an urban area. The
sample included children from a wide range of socioeconomic
backgrounds and reflected the population of children attending
schools in this area. The mean chronological age for the entire
group was 9.7 (SD = 0.3) years; the overall range was 9.3 to
10.2 years. No participant had any behavioral or medical con-
dition that would qualify as an exclusion criterion for this study.
The testing procedures were repeated for the entire sam-
ple after 32 months. From the initial sample, data from 9
children were missing. The mean age was 12.1 years (SD =
0.2) for the whole group (N = 58) at the second sampling, and
the group consisted of 28 girls and 30 boys.
Measurements
Reading.Reading was tested using the Wordchain Test
(WCT) in Norwegian, the ordkjeder (Wordchains; Høien &
Tønnesen, 1997). In the WCT, the participants were given a
booklet containing rows presented in the form of 90 chains
similar to the following:
Peghousefishone sandcoffeebluehome lambglassbootcat
mudswanbrightrocket
Subjects were given 4 min in which to divide as many
chains as possible into their component words by drawing a
4 SAGE Open
line where the gap should be. Both speed and accuracy of
word recognition is measured (Miller-Guron & Lundberg,
2000). Higher scores on WCT indicate better performance.
The WCT measures speed and accuracy of word recognition,
and has proved to be a reliable and valid test to assess iso-
lated word decoding proficiency (Jacobson, 1993; Miller-
Guron, 1999).
Physical fitness. The TPF is a measure that aims to provide
reliable and objective quantification of children's physical
fitness (Fjørtoft et al., 2003, 2011). The TPF consists of nine
different test items: three items based on jumping, two on
throwing, one on climbing, and three on running. The test
items are described in more detail elsewhere (see Fjørtoft
et al., 2011; Haga, 2009). Higher TPF scores indicate better
performance. Test­retest correlation of total TPF scores is
high (0.90, p < .0001; Fjørtoft et al., 2011). The construct
validity of the test was 0.93 for girls and 0.89 for boys (p <
.0001 for both, Spearman's correlation; Fjørtoft et al., 2011).
Motor competence.The MABC (Henderson & Sugden,
1992) was used to measure motor performance. The MABC
is an extended version of Test of Motor Impairment (TOMI;
Stott, Moyes, & Henderson, 1984). The MABC provides a
global test of motor competence and is designed for children
in the 4- to 12-year age group. The test is standardized and
requires the participant to perform a motor task in a specified
way. The test provides a quantitative evaluation of the child's
or adolescent's motor competence. Each age group is tested
on eight items in three subcategories: manual dexterity, ball
skills, and static and dynamic balance. The test contains dif-
ferent tasks for different ages. A child's performance is ref-
erenced to a standardized sample value from individuals of
same age. Lower MABC scores indicate better motor com-
petence. The MABC has a minimum test­retest reliability at
any age of 0.75 and an interrater reliability of 0.70 (Hender-
son & Sugden, 1992; Tan, Parker, & Larkin, 2001).
Procedure
All participants and parents provided informed consent before
participation in the study, and all procedures were performed
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The partici-
pants were tested using the MABC and WCT on the same day,
and then using the TPF 1 week later. The assessment of motor
performance took place in a quiet room during normal school
hours. The assessment of physical fitness took place in a sport
hall. All participants were tested individually by assistants
who had been trained in the test protocols. Each test item was
explained and demonstrated to the participant before testing.
During the testing, participants were given verbal encourage-
ment and support. If the participants made a procedural error,
instructions and demonstrations were repeated and the partici-
pant made a new attempt. The participant wore clothing and
trainers suitable for physical activity during both tests.
Data Reduction and Analysis
For the statistical analysis, SPSS Version 19 for Windows
was used (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A total TPF score
was calculated by transforming test item scores into stan-
dardized scores (z scores) using the overall sample mean.
Higher z scores indicate higher performance on the tasks.
The total test score for each child was calculated as the aver-
age z score. Pearson product­moment correlation was used
to investigate the possible associations between the MABC,
TPF, and WCT. To analyze the significance of the difference
between the correlation coefficient between genders, Fischer
r-to-z transformation was used. Statistical significance was
set at p < .05.
Results
Descriptive statistics of the overall MABC score and the sub-
category scores were calculated for the following: manual
dexterity, ball skills, and balance; the nine TPF test items;
and the WCT for the age groups 9- and 12-year-old girls and
boys. The results are shown in Table 1. Higher scores on the
TPF and WCT indicate better performance (better physical
fitness and reading skills), while lower scores on MABC
indicate better motor competence. Table 1 shows the perfor-
mance on all test items using the TPF test and the WCT, and
results improved from 9 years of age to 12 years of age. It is
difficult to determine the changes in the MABC because the
test items at age 9 years are different than those used at age
12 years (the test battery contains of different tasks in the age
span 9 to 10 years and 11 to 12 years).
The correlation (Pearson's, two-tailed) between total
MABC, TPF, and WCT scores for the 9- and 12-year-old chil-
dren are presented in Table 2. When the children were 9 years
old, there was a low correlation between motor competence
and reading for the entire group (r = -.031), and for both girls
(r = -.207) and boys (r = .180). For boys, there was a positive
correlation, indicating that higher motor competence is related
to lower reading performance (lower WCT score), or the
reverse. The correlation between physical fitness and reading
skills for the entire group was also low (r = .064). However,
there was a significant correlation between physical fitness
and reading in girls (r = .404, p < .05; 95% confidence interval
[CI]: [0.055, 0.662]). For boys, the correlation was negative
and low (r = -.138). In addition, there was no significant asso-
ciation between the cardiovascular fitness component (mea-
sured using the reduced Cooper test) and reading when they
were analyzed separately from the total TPF score.
When the children were 12 years old, a low correlation
was found between motor competence and reading skills for
the entire group (r = -.134), which is similar for both girls (r
= -.074) and boys (r = .028). There was a low correlation
between physical fitness and reading skills for the entire
group (r = -.022), which is similar for girls (r = -.041) and
boys (r = -.017).

Discussion
These results suggest that the relationship between motor
competence and reading skills in children who are 9 and 12
years of age are low both for girls and boys, but at 9 years of
age, there was a significant correlation between physical fit-
ness and reading for girls (r = .404, p < .05). The correlation
is negative for the entire group (9 and 12 years) and for girls,
but positive for the boys at 9 and 12 years (i.e., better perfor-
mance in MABC correlates with a lower performance on the
WCT or vice versa). These results are partly supported by
earlier findings that showed no strong association between
motor competence and academic achievement (Haapala
et al., 2014; Uhrich & Swalm, 2007), as well as between fit-
ness and academic performance (Haapala et al., 2015;
Kantomaa et al., 2013; Resaland, Aadland, Moe, Aadland, &
Skrede, 2016). It is challenging, however, to compare across
studies because of the diverse measurement used to assess
the different variables.
In the 1960s, there were attempts to explore and explain
how perceptual-motor functioning could increase educa-
tional effectiveness, and perceptual-motor training was a pri-
mary intervention method in special education (Kephart,
2004). Behind such a hypothesis, there was an assumption
about the existence of underlying general abilities in both the
motor and cognitive domains, and that they shared common
underlying processes. However, a meta-analysis concluded
that interventions based on perceptual-motor training were
not effective for the improvement of academic or cognitive
variables (Kavale & Mattson, 1983). More recently, similar
findings have emerged in intervention studies that showed no
effect of increased physical activity on academic perfor-
mance in numeracy, reading, and English (Resaland et al.,
2016). Empirical evidence to support the construct of such
general abilities is also lacking; for example, correlation
between the eight test items and also within each of the
MABC subgroups (manual dexterity, balance, and ball skills)
is low (Haga, Pedersen, & Sigmundsson, 2008). In addition,
very low correlations are reported between six test items of
static and dynamic balance (Drowatsky & Zuccato, 1967) as
well as between three fine motor tasks in adults (Lorås &
Sigmundsson, 2012). For cognitive skills, intercorrelations
between mathematics tasks are found to be relatively low-to-
moderate, indicating that the nine test items shared less than
25% of the variance (Sigmundsson, Polman, & Lorås, 2013).
Therefore, because of the low correlations within separate
domains (i.e., the motor and cognitive domains), the low cor-
relation between skills in different domains (motor compe-
tence and reading) is not surprising.
Except for a significant and moderate correlation between
physical fitness and reading in 9-year-old girls (r = .404;
17.7% shared variance), no significant associations between
fitness and reading skills where found in either age group.
These results are in accordance with the relatively low rela-
tionships between motor competence and reading, and may
confirm the lack of spillover from the physical modality to
the cognitive modality. There is no consensus about this
association in children, but the associations between physical
fitness and cognitive skills seems to be stronger when com-
paring children with high and low fitness levels, with the lat-
ter having worse academic or cognitive achievement
(Chaddock et al., 2010; Hillman, Castelli, & Buck, 2005;
Scudder et al., 2014). Thus, a possible association could be
exaggerated by comparing groups at the extremes of the
distribution.
The significant differences between girls and boys in the
9-year-old age group (see Table 2) and the significant corre-
lation between fitness and reading in girls may be explained
by earlier maturation of the neural network that is more
important for executive function in girls than in boys (Giedd,
Raznahan, Mills, & Lenroot, 2012). However, this associa-
tion is not found when the children are 12 years old. This
could be linked to the suggestion by Hillmann et al. (2017)
that variability is a hallmark of cognitive performance
because both maturation and experience influence structure
and function.
Physical activity and fitness are reported to have effects
on executive functions (Davis et al., 2011; Kamijo et al.,
2011) and they may provide some benefits for learning.
However, research indicates that to develop skills such as
reading, specific training is needed. Dehaene et al. (2010)
suggested that learning to read means reorganizing neural
circuits in the brain; the changes that reading makes to our
brain result mainly from the effect of our experience with
reading. These findings can be used as an argument for task
specificity principles of learning across cognitive and motor
skills, because the processes associated with learning may
seem relatively independent and specific (Hadders-Algra,
2000; Sigmundsson et al., 2013). As mentioned in the intro-
duction, coordination and motor skill learning taps into the
neurophysiological motor system, which is characterized by
its plasticity (Kleim & Jones, 2008). A perspective that has
been translated into the domain of human motor behavior is
the "neuronal group selection theory" (NGST; Blauw-
Hospers, Dirks, Hulshof, Bos, & Hadders-Algra, 2011;
Edelman, 1987, 1992; Hadders-Algra, 2000; Thelen &
Smith, 1994). Within this theory, experience and stimuli
serve as the basis for motor development and learning,
emphasizing that development is a process of selection
within the central nervous system. This means that behav-
ioral experience increases connections within specific areas
of the brain and strengthens the neural network involved in
the generation of successful movement. Under this perspec-
tive, the gradual learning and performance of an efficient
Sigmundsson et al. 7
movement solution for a given task is experience-dependent,
because it builds on self-produced instances of trial and error
(Gottlieb, 1998; Hadders-Algra, 2000; Thelen & Smith,
1994). Training/executing specific tasks will reinforce the
neural networks that are involved in a particular task, thus
making this behavior more plausible to be performed the
next time (Sporns & Edelman, 1993). NGST may support the
task-specificity hypothesis of learning (Edelman, 1987,
1992) and the low association of motor competence and
physical fitness with reading in this study can be generally
interpreted as support for specificity in learning skills.
A challenge in this field is also how the different con-
structs are conceptualized and measured (Donnelly et al.,
2016). It is difficult to obtain a pure measure of the basic
components of physical fitness in children. Even in test and
laboratory settings, only an indirect indication of the differ-
ent basic components is likely. Because physical fitness is
measured by performing movements, elements of motor
behavior will always be included (Fjørtoft et al., 2003, 2011).
Fjørtoft et al. (2011) suggested that the constituent compo-
nents of a skill are not known, nor is it known how they com-
bine to make up the complex skill, making it hard to find an
isolated measure of the basic components. Movement tests
do not always discriminate well between motor competence
and physical fitness (Vandendriessche et al., 2011), and
therefore, finding the independent contributions of each phe-
nomenon to the outcomes of interest is impeded. Thus, the
association between these variables and cognitive function
may depend on the specific content of the specific fitness test
and the tasks used to measure motor competence.
Stronger associations are found between cardiovascular
fitness and academic achievement when field-based running
test were used as a measure compared with ergometer cycle
tests (Haapala et al., 2015). Haapala also suggests that, in
children, motor competence may have a greater effect on
executions of such fitness tasks, as the running technique is
not as well developed; this suggests that motor performance
is more important for academic achievement compared with
cardiovascular fitness.
It is also unclear whether fitness is related to better perfor-
mance in cognitive outcomes because of indirect factors,
such as motivation and attention to tasks, or if fitness has a
more direct effect on specific subprocesses related to reading
(Scudder et al., 2014). It might be that physical fitness is
more related to executive functions (Tomporowski, Davis,
Miller, & Naglieri, 2008; Van der Niet et al., 2014), which
can be regarded as premises for the learning process and aca-
demic achievement (Diamond, 2013.)
This study has some limitations. First, the statistical power
of the relative small sample must be taken into account.
Second, possible sex differences are not sufficiently discussed
in this article. Furthermore, the data are not adjusted for socio-
economic status, which is an important confounder that could
both predict academic performance and moderate the associa-
tion between physical fitness and academic skills.
Conclusion
Different types of physical activity may have the potential to
enhance the metabolic mechanism and improve executive
function and academic performance. A challenge to target is
how to conceptualize and measure the different constructs
included in motor competence and physical fitness. However,
to learn and improve academic skills, it is possible that prac-
tice should be specific to the particular cognitive skill that is
being performed. The results from this study may support the
principle of specificity in learning, because the results for
boys (9 and 12 years old) and girls (12 years old) in this
study showed very low associations of physical fitness and
motor competence with reading skills. However, there was a
significant correlation between physical fitness and reading
in girls at the age of 9 years. Further research related to sex
differences and the life span perspective is required.
