"Emotion" has, since 1884, been a theoretical keyword at the
heart of modern psychology. In that year William James wrote an
influential article in Mind entitled "What Is an Emotion?" A cen-
tury and a quarter later, however, there seems to be little scientific
consensus on the answer to his question, and some are beginning
to wonder whether it is the very category of "emotion" that is the
problem.
Izard's (2010a) interviews with leading emotion scientists,
together with responses from other experts, powerfully demon-
strate that, despite the continuing proliferation of books, jour-
nals, conferences, and theories on the subject of "emotion,"
there is still no consensus on the meaning of this term. Some
even believe that it should be thrown out of psychology alto-
gether. Among the scientists surveyed by Izard, there was mod-
erate support for the view that the term "emotion" is "ambiguous
and has no status in science," and that it should therefore be
abandoned (2010a, pp. 367­368). "Emotion" is certainly a key-
word in modern psychology, but it is a keyword in crisis. Indeed,
as I shall suggest below, it has been in crisis, from a definitional
and conceptual point of view, ever since its adoption as a
psychological category in the 19th century.
Izard's recent article and several of the responses to it (White,
2010; Widen & Russell, 2010; Wierzbicka, 2010) ask questions
about the language of "emotion": whether it forms part of a uni-
versal human "folk psychology," whether it is part of "ordinary
language" in English, and whether, in light of the answers to
these questions, it can be expected to operate as part of a truly
scientific lexicon. An historical perspective can help to answer
these questions.
Historians have long recognised the importance of keywords
as both mirrors and motors of social and intellectual change
(Dixon, 2008; Williams, 1976). This is especially true in the
realms of culture and thought, where new words, or new mean-
ings attached to old ones, can create new concepts, and even
new worldviews, which in turn transform people's ability to
imagine, experience, and understand themselves. Psychological
categories and concepts in particular have this reflexive rela-
tionship with our mental lives, shaping and colouring as well as
explaining them (Khalidi, 2010; R. Smith, 2005, 2007). The his-
tory of the term "emotion" as a keyword of just this kind is both
shorter and more eventful than its modern users might imagine.
Although the word "emotion" (imported into English from the
French émotion) was in use in the 17th and 18th centuries, it did
not become established as the name for a category of mental
states that might be systematically studied until the mid-19th
century. The present article uses the intellectual history of this
term to offer an historical diagnosis of the contemporary defini-
tional malaise, and to offer a reminder of some of the ideas
about passions, affections, and emotions that have been forgot-
ten during the last two centuries.
"Emotion": The History of a Keyword in Crisis

Abstract
The word "emotion" has named a psychological category and a subject for systematic enquiry only since the 19th century.
Before then, relevant mental states were categorised variously as "appetites," "passions," "affections," or "sentiments." The word
"emotion" has existed in English since the 17th century, originating as a translation of the French émotion, meaning a physical
disturbance. It came into much wider use in 18th-century English, often to refer to mental experiences, becoming a fully fledged
theoretical term in the following century, especially through the influence of two Scottish philosopher-physicians, Thomas Brown
and Charles Bell. This article relates this intellectual and semantic history to contemporary debates about the usefulness and
meaning of "emotion" as a scientific term.

Dixon "Emotion": Keyword in Crisis 339
As Izard (2010b) rightly points out about the current debates,
the problem is not that the term "emotion" has no clear mean-
ing, but that it has many meanings (2010b, p. 385). This has
been the case historically too. I have divided this article into
three sections which correspond to three different dimensions of
those multiple meanings: categories, concepts, and connota-
tions. By thinking about categories, we can investigate which
mental states have been thought to fall into the category of
"emotion," and what alternative mental typologies have been
used, especially those which made a fundamental distinction
between "passions" and "affections." Secondly, by looking at
the multiple concepts that have been named by the single term
"emotion," we can ask what theorists have intended to claim
about a mental or bodily state by calling it an "emotion." From
the outset, there was ambiguity and confusion. Finally, in the
realm of connotations, we have access to those broader intel-
lectual, linguistic, and disciplinary frameworks within which
keywords function. We will see that the different cultural terri-
tories within which the words "passions" and "emotions" oper-
ated gave them different roles in the production of both mental
experiences and of psychological theories. These reflections on
connotation will pave the way for some brief concluding
thoughts on "emotion" as a term in both everyday and scientific
language in the 21st century, and the morals we can draw from
history.
Categories
The first books written on the subject of "the emotions" appeared
between the 1830s and 1850s (Bain, 1859; Cooke, 1838; Lyall,
1855; Ramsay, 1848). Until then, philosophers, physicians, mor-
alists, and theologians generally used more than one term with
which to theorise about mental states which would later be des-
ignated "emotions." Theorists distinguished especially between
"passions" on the one hand and "affections" on the other. In 1836
the English polymath William Whewell commented that the pro-
posal to refer to what he called "the desires and affections" of
human nature as "the Emotions" had not been generally accepted.
Even as late as 1862, Whewell was expressing his preference for
the compound phrase "the desires and affections," while
acknowledging that the term "emotional" had been adopted by
some recent writers (Whewell footnotes to Mackintosh, 1862,
pp. xlv, 79; see also Dixon, 2003, pp. 186­187).
In order to understand this all-important distinction between
troubling desires and passions on the one hand and milder affec-
tions and sentiments on the other, we need to look back briefly
to ancient debates between Stoicism and Christianity. An analy-
sis of works by two of the most influential medieval Christian
theologians, Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas, reveals
that it was their desire to provide an alternative to the moral
philosophy of the Greek and Roman Stoics that led to their crea-
tion of the distinction between passions and affections (Dixon,
2003). The Stoics had famously treated all the passions as dis-
eases of the soul, from which the wise man could be cured by
the application of calm reason. When the Stoic sage felt the
"first movements" of a passion stirring with him, he was advised
to withhold his assent from the judgement underlying that incip-
ient passion, thus retaining his composure and peace of mind,
his apatheia. The Stoics aimed thus to use a kind of cognitive
therapy to remain free of passions and perturbations of the
mind, while still being able to enjoy milder positive feelings
known as eupatheiai (Annas, 1992; Sorabji, 2000).
The response of Augustine and Aquinas to this Stoic view
was twofold. In one way, they agreed with the Stoics: The pas-
sions were indeed violent forces that could conflict with reason
and lead an individual into sin. But, on the other hand, they did
not agree that a state of complete Stoic apatheia was one to be
wished for. As Augustine put it, someone who no longer trem-
bled from fear or suffered from sorrow would not have won true
peace, but would rather have lost all humanity (Augustine,
1966, XIV.9). It was important for theologians to be able to dis-
tinguish between those troubling movements of the soul--appe-
tites, lusts, desires, passions--that the good Christian should
avoid, and those more virtuous and Godly affections of love and
compassion to which they might rightly aspire. For Aquinas, the
passions and affections were movements of two different parts
of the soul, namely the sense appetite and the intellectual
appetite respectively. The latter was another term for the will.
This distinction between passions of the sense appetite and
affections of the intellectual appetite, although interpreted vari-
ously by different theorists and only rarely elaborated in detail,
undergirded moral-philosophical thought for many centuries.
The distinction was explicitly discussed in several philosophical
works (e.g., Charleton, 1701; Hutcheson, 1728/1742). A treatise
about religious affections by the American preacher and phi-
losopher Jonathan Edwards emphasised that affections were
movements of the intellectual part of the soul:
Holy affections are not heat without light, but evermore arise from some
information of the understanding, some spiritual instruction that the mind
receives, some light or actual knowledge. (Edwards 1746/1959, p. 266)
The 18th century saw a proliferation of new ideas about senti-
ments and sensibility, as well as about passions and affections.
But in almost all theoretical works, the various feelings and
emotions of the human heart and intellect were understood to
fall into at least two categories: the more violent and self-
regarding "passions" and "appetites" on the one hand, and the
milder and more enlightened "interests," social "affections,"
and "moral sentiments" on the other (DeJean, 1997; Dixon,
2003; Hirschman, 1997). A multivolume work on the passions
and affections of the mind composed in the early 19th century
by the physician and philosopher Thomas Cogan restated the
semantic distinction between passions and affections, noting
that in common usage the word "passion" was often applied to
"the evil propensities," while "affection" was used for the "vir-
tuous propensities; as the social, friendly, parental, filial affec-
tions" (1802, p. 3). And, as we have already seen, as late as 1862
Whewell was expressing his preference for the compound
phrase "the desires and affections."
This more differentiated typology was lost with the rise of the
capacious new category of "emotion" during the 19th century.
340 Emotion Review Vol. 4 No. 4
The key figure in this transition was the Edinburgh professor of
moral philosophy Thomas Brown, whom I have previously des-
ignated the "inventor of the emotions" (Dixon, 2003, p. 109).
Brown subsumed the "appetites," "passions," and "affections"
under a single category: the "emotions." The word "emotion"
was already in wide usage, but in Brown's lectures, first pub-
lished in 1820, the term took on a newly systematic theoretical
role in the science of the mind. This innovation proved to be
popular. In arguably the first modern psychological book about
the emotions, the incredibly wide reach of the new category was
made explicit: "Emotion is the name here used to comprehend
all that is understood by feelings, states of feeling, pleasures,
pains, passions, sentiments, affections" (Bain, 1859, p. 3). Two
decades later, McCosh (1880) enumerated over 100 discrete
feeling states that fell into the category. How could anyone pos-
sibly devise a single theory, or a simple conceptual definition,
that could cover such a wide range of different mental states?
The answer is that no one could.
Concepts
The word "emotion" first arrived on British shores from France
in the early 17th century. John Florio, the translator of Michel de
Montaigne's celebrated essays, apologised to his readers for the
introduction of various "uncouth termes" from French into his
English version of the work, including among them the word
"emotion" (de Montaigne, 1603, p. v). In both its French and
English forms, "emotion" was a word denoting physical distur-
bance and bodily movement. It could mean a commotion among
a group of people (as in the phrase "public emotion"), or a phys-
ical agitation of anything at all, from the weather, or a tree, to
the human body (DeJean, 1997; Diller, 2010).
Increasingly, during the 18th century, "emotion" came to
refer to the bodily stirrings accompanying mental feelings. The
Stoic idea of "first movements," those physical stirrings that
marked the onset of a passion, was sometimes referred to with
the phrase "first emotions of passion," as it was in a sermon
preached before the queen of England in 1711 on the subject of
"The government of passion" and also in Fielding's 1749 novel
The History of Tom Jones (Clarke, 1738, p. 426; Fielding, 1749,
Vol. 2, p. 306). And for some medical and philosophical writers,
the term "emotion" was reserved for those bodily movements
which served as the external signs of inward passions and affec-
tions. Bentham (1789/1996) wrote that "The emotions of the
body are received, and with reason, as probable indications of
the temperature of the mind" (1789/1966, p. 63; cf. LeBrun,
1734, pp. 21, 34). This usage was continued into the early 19th
century by Cogan (1802), who insisted that the term "emotions"
was properly applicable only to those "sensible changes and vis-
ible effects which particular passions produce upon the frame"
(1802, pp. 7­8). This idea, that emotions were external and vis-
ible effects, also explains why the term "sensible" (meaning
outwardly observable) was so frequently applied to the term
"emotion" in 18th-century texts (Diller, 2010, p. 150).
Finally, from the mid-18th century onwards, "emotion"
moved from the bodily to the mental domain. As early as 1649,
Descartes had attempted to introduce the term émotion as an
alternative to passion in his theoretical treatise on the passions
of the soul (DeJean, 1997; S. James, 1997). His suggestion was
not generally followed, however, and the earliest works to make
frequent use of "emotion" as a term for feeling, passion, and
related states of mind did not appear until about 100 years later,
in the 1740s and 1750s. These included important philosophical
works by two central figures of the Scottish Enlightenment,
Hume (1739­1740) and A. Smith (1759). Their uses of the term
were far from systematic, however. For them, as for many other
writers in the second half of the 18th century, "emotion" func-
tioned either as an undefined and general term for any kind of
mental feeling or agitation, or sometimes as a stylistic variant
for central theoretical terms such as "passion" and "affection"
(Dixon, 2003).
As I have already indicated, it was in the early 19th-century
lectures of another Scottish philosopher, Thomas Brown, that
the term "emotion" definitively took on its new status as a the-
oretical category in mental science, replacing those "active
powers" of the mind, the "passions" and "affections." Brown, a
physician and poet as well as a philosopher, was the first to
treat "emotion" as a major theoretical category in the academic
study of the mind, and his use was the most systematic and
most influential of the period. Here, then, in the lecture halls of
Edinburgh University in the years between 1810 and 1820, we
arrive at the key moment in the history of our modern concepts
of "emotion."
What, then, was the definition that Professor Brown ascribed
to this important new theoretical term in mental science? "The
exact meaning of the term emotion," Brown told his students, "it
is difficult to state in any form of words." And it has remained
so ever since. Brown did go a little further than this in trying to
offer a definition of the "emotions":
Perhaps, if any definition of them be possible, they may be defined to be
vivid feelings, arising immediately from the consideration of objects,
perceived, or remembered, or imagined, or from other prior emotions.
(Brown, 1820/2010, pp. 145­146)
In other words, unlike sensations, which were caused directly
by external objects, emotions were caused by the mental "con-
sideration" of perceived objects; and, unlike intellectual states,
they were defined as noncognitive "vivid feelings" rather than
as forms of thought.
Brown's lectures exercised a very wide influence in the dec-
ades between 1820 and 1860, and it became standard to repeat
his statement that the term "emotion" was difficult to define
except in terms of vividness of feeling. Although everyone
apparently knew what an "emotion" was, theorists agreed with
Brown that this could not be embodied in any verbal definition
(Dixon, 2003, pp. 129­130). Two hundred years later, we are
still living with this legacy of Thomas Brown's concept of
"emotion." Psychologists have continued to complain, at regu-
lar intervals, right up to the present, that "emotion" is utterly
resistant to definitional efforts (Izard, 2010a, 2010b). This is
hardly surprising for a term that, from the outset, was defined as
being indefinable.
Dixon "Emotion": Keyword in Crisis 341
Brown's was also a strongly noncognitive concept of "emo-
tion." His stark separation between intellectual thoughts and
emotional feelings was endorsed by many of the leading psy-
chologists of the late 19th century. Bain (1855, 1859), McCosh
(1886, 1887), Baldwin (1891), and Sully (1892) all produced
two-volume textbooks of psychology in which Volume 1 was
devoted to the senses and the intellect, and Volume 2 to the
emotions, feelings, and will.
But Brown was not the only important early "emotion" theo-
rist, and so his is not the only relevant legacy. A second key
figure was another Edinburgh physician and philosopher,
Charles Bell. Bell was an important figure in the history of neu-
rology and also the most influential 19th-century theorist of
expression before 1872, when Darwin published his work on
the subject. Bell's theories of emotion and expression, worked
out in the successive editions of his essays on the anatomy and
philosophy of expression published between 1806 and 1844,
provided foundations later built upon by both Darwin and
James. It is well known that Darwin argued strongly against the
theological notion in Bell's work that the muscles of the human
face had been divinely designed to express the higher senti-
ments. What has only rarely been noticed, however, is that
Darwin took his main theoretical principle of expression,
namely the idea of "serviceable associated habits," directly
from Bell's work (Darwin, 1872; Dixon, 2003).
Such is Bell's importance, in fact, in this conceptual history
that it would be appropriate to think of him as the coinventor of
the modern "emotions" along with Brown. Where Brown was
the key theorist of "emotions" as vivid mental feelings with men-
tal causes, in Bell's work we find a concept of "emotion" which
for the first time gave a constitutive role to bodily movements.
For Bell an "emotion" was a movement of the mind. His brief
definition of the term was that "emotions" were "certain changes
or affections of the mind, as grief, joy, or astonishment," which
could become visible through "outward signs" on the face or
body (Bell, 1824, p. 19). The additional interest of Bell's work,
however, is the importance he gave to bodily movements, espe-
cially of the heart and lungs, as not only outward signs, but also
as constitutive causes of emotional experience. He recognised
that the idea that the emotions might "proceed from or in any
degree pertain to the body" might not "willingly be admitted" by
his readers (Bell, 1824, pp. 20­21). Nonetheless, he tried to per-
suade them that the "organs of breathing and speech" were nec-
essary not only to the "expression" of emotions, but also to their
"development." Bell pressed the point further, arguing that the
operation of the organs of expression preceded "the mental emo-
tions with which they are to be joined," and strengthened and
directed them. He even argued that the reason that all people
experienced the same "internal feelings and emotions or pas-
sions" was because of the uniform operation of the bodily organs
(Bell, 1824, pp. 20­21). The parallel here with W. James's
famous formulation, published six decades later, is very striking.
W. James was certainly familiar with Bell's work, although only
making a passing reference to him in his 1884 article (p. 191).
Darwin (1872) had also endorsed a similar view of the indis-
pensable role of bodily movements in a fully fledged emotion,
suggesting that: "Most of our emotions are so closely connected
with their expression, that they hardly exist if the body remains
passive" (1872, pp. 239­240).
In Bell's works, then, we find the final piece of the jigsaw.
Here was the source of the idea that the term "emotion" referred
to mental states that necessarily had an outward bodily expres-
sion, which additionally somehow constituted the emotion.
Taken in combination with Brown's influential treatment of the
"emotions" as a very broad category of noncognitive states of
feeling, we now have a clear picture of the origins of the late
19th-century theories of emotion which have given rise to so
many conceptual and definitional problems. While Brown and
Bell agreed that an "emotion" was itself something mental,
they differed over whether its constituents were primarily men-
tal or bodily. The tensions between these two models were
never fully resolved. Darwin and James were both influenced
by these works produced in Edinburgh in the opening 2 dec-
ades of the 19th century. Darwin even studied medicine in
Edinburgh briefly in the 1820s, and James stated that he spent
his youth immersed in philosophical works by Brown and by
Brown's predecessor in the moral philosophy chair, Dugald
Stewart (W. James, 1902/1985, p. 2). For centuries, theorists
have debated what should be considered the true seat of the
emotions: the soul or the body; the heart or the brain (Bound
Alberti, 2010). In view of the importance of Brown and Bell in
this conceptual history, I would suggest that the true seat of the
"emotions" was in fact the University of Edinburgh, circa 1820
(Dixon, 2006).
Connotations
It is appropriate that at this stage of the argument we should
have reached a conclusion about a particular institution and a
particular place. This reminds us that words do not operate in
vacuums, but rather within lexical and social networks. Words
derive their meanings from the company they keep, and that
applies both to the other words they rub shoulders with, and to
the speakers, writers, and readers through whose minds, mouths,
hands, and eyes they pass.
The semantic connotations that were lost by the transition
from "passions" and "affections" to "emotions" in theories of
the human mind can all be grouped together under the unifying
theme of pathology: cognitive, medical, or moral (Dixon, 2006,
2011). "Passion" and "affection" were both terms whose ety-
mology and core meanings emphasised passivity, suffering, and
disease. For the Stoics, the passions had been diseases of the
soul, to be cured by cognitive therapy, and right up to the 19th
century the terms "passion" and "affection" were used in medi-
cal contexts as terms for organic disease. Passions and affec-
tions of the mind, especially in their stronger forms, were also
considered by physicians to constitute a constant threat to health
and life. Since the key early "emotion" theorists, including
Brown and Bell, were almost all trained medics, it is significant
that they chose to use a word for the vivid mental feelings which
detached them from this medical thought-world and its patho-
logical associations, bestowing to subsequent generations of
342 Emotion Review Vol. 4 No. 4
mental philosophers and psychologists a newly de-medicalised
concept (Dixon, 2006).
Questions of professional and disciplinary identity are also
germane to thinking about the detachment of "emotion" from the
established languages of morality and religion. Many of the most
influential theorists of "passions" and "affections" had been
moral philosophers, clergymen, or both. Preachers and theologi-
ans, as well as secular moralists, most often found themselves
discoursing on these subjects in order to demonstrate the impor-
tance of governing the passions and cultivating the affections.
During the religious revivals of the 18th century, in which the
feelings and sympathies of the human heart were so important,
preachers such as Edwards (1746/1959) and Whitefield (1772)
spoke and wrote in the language of the Bible. The terms "pas-
sions," "lusts," "desires," and "affections" all had a biblical ped-
igree. The term "passion" had an additional biblical association
through its connection with the gospel accounts of the sufferings
and death of Jesus of Nazareth. The terms "emotion" and "emo-
tions," by contrast, were detached from the linguistic worlds of
theology and moralism. They never appeared in any English
translation of the Bible and, unlike the terms "passion" and "pas-
sions," were very unlikely to be paired with such moralising epi-
thets as "despicable," "detestable," "evil," "perverted," or
"vicious" (Diller, 2010, p. 150; Dixon, 2011).
When modern uses of "emotion" and "emotional" emerged
during the 19th century, they connoted knowledge of and sym-
pathy with a modern and scientific approach to human mental
life. They were words which belonged within a secular, morally
neutral, and scientific register. The linguistic shift from "pas-
sions" and "affections" to "emotions" thus both reflected and
enabled shifts in institutional and intellectual authority. By the
end of the 19th century the view was on the rise in European and
American universities that a properly scientific account of the
human mind would be produced only through a thoroughly
physiological investigation. Champions of this view explicitly
contrasted their work with the philosophical psychology of their
predecessors (and contemporaries), which they believed was
still in thrall to theological, spiritual, and dualistic views of the
human person.
One particularly able critic of the physiological tendency of
modern psychology in general, and of James's theory of emo-
tion in particular, was David Irons. Irons argued in several arti-
cles in the 1890s and in his book on moral psychology (1903)
that emotions were irreducible "attitudes" of the whole person
(Dixon, 2003; Gendron & Barrett, 2009, p. 325). It is notable
that Havelock Ellis's response to Irons attacked him not only for
his theoretical views, but for his ignorance of human physiology
and his reliance on the tools of philosophy. Ellis wrote that the
problems of modern psychology required "something more than
a merely logical equipment; they require a very considerable
physiological and even pathological equipment" and that any-
one who could suggest, for instance, that melancholia lacked a
physical basis was evidently "not competent to discuss the
nature of emotion" (Ellis, 1895, p. 160).
In summary, the term "emotion" suited the purposes of a self-
consciously secularising and scientific cadre of psychological
theorists in the late 19th century, detached as it was from the
centuries of moral and theological connotations that had accrued
to the terms "passion" and "affection." "Emotion," for progres-
sives such as Ellis, was the name of a domain of scientific study
from which mere philosophers were to be barred. Competence to
discuss emotion now required a training in physiology. As
W. James put it at the end of his 1884 Mind article, the truth or
falsity of his theory of emotion would be best determined not by
logical analysis, but by empirical investigations undertaken by
"asylum-physicians and nervous specialists" who "alone have
the data in their hands" (1884, p. 204).
Conclusions
So, when W. James famously asked in 1884, "What is an emo-
tion?" he was not engaging with an age-old conundrum, but was
seeking to define a psychological category that had been in
existence only a couple of generations. James's answer to his
own question, one which revealed his indebtedness to Brown,
Bell, and Darwin, was that emotions were vivid mental feelings
of visceral changes brought about directly by the perception of
some object in the world.
James's theory had a curious early career. On the one hand,
it became, along with the similar theory of the Danish psycholo-
gist Carl F. Lange, the flagship emotion theory of the fledgling
science of psychology. On the other hand, the theory entirely
failed to create consensus among the psychological community
except, perhaps, a consensus that it was wrong. Within 10 years
of the publication of James's original theory it had been system-
atically rebutted in almost all the leading philosophical and psy-
chological journals. Critics in the 1880s and 1890s argued that
James's theory failed to distinguish between emotions and non-
emotions; that it failed to differentiate between the different
emotions; that it gave excessive priority to feelings of bodily
change at the expense of other components of emotion; and that
it unnecessarily denied the role played by cognitive and intel-
lectual factors in generating emotion. James's article created
further confusion by seeming to support several different claims
about whether all emotions had bodily expressions, or only
some, and whether this was a matter of definition, or of empiri-
cal discovery (Dixon, 2003; Ellsworth, 1994; Feinstein, 1970).
After ten years of rebuttals of his original theory, W. James
duly published (1894) a restatement of his views on emotion,
which included so many concessions and qualifications as to
amount virtually to a retraction of his own theory. So, by the
1890s, although the idea that "emotion" was the name of a psycho-
logical category had become entrenched, the nascent psychologi-
cal community had neither an agreed definition of the extent of the
category, nor a shared idea of the fundamental characteristics of
the states that fell within it.
The founders of the discipline of psychology in the late 19th
century bequeathed to their successors a usage of "emotion" in
which the relationship between mind and body and between
thought and feeling were confused and unresolved, and which
named a category of feelings and behaviours so broad as to
cover almost all of human mental life including, as Bain (1859)
Dixon "Emotion": Keyword in Crisis 343
had put it, all that was previously understood by the terms "feel-
ings, states of feeling, pleasures, pains, passions, sentiments,
affections" (1859, p. 3).
The survey undertaken recently by Izard (2010a) reveals that
psychologists are still living with this legacy. On the basis of the
replies to his questionnaire, Izard put together a composite
description of what contemporary emotion scientists mean by
"emotion." The most commonly cited features were summa-
rised by Izard in one sentence:
Emotion consists of neural circuits (that are at least partially dedicated),
response systems, and a feeling state/process that motivates and
organizes cognition and action. (2010a, p. 367)
Izard emphasised that this was not meant to be a definition of
"emotion," but a description of the dominant uses. Nonetheless,
it indicates well enough the challenges that still face theorists of
"emotion," especially the need somehow to articulate the
assumed relationships between physiological processes and
mental experiences, and between states of feeling and states of
thought. Among those philosophical and psychological writers
of the 19th century (and before) whose works have been
excluded from the canon of the history of psychology, but who
resisted the conglomeration of "passions" and "affections" into
"emotions," who argued for the centrality of the intellect and
cognition to states of feeling, and who connected psychology
most closely to philosophy and ethics rather than to physiology,
some clues may still be found as to what went wrong in the
construction of modern concepts of "emotion" in psychology
(Dixon, 2003, 2011; Gendron & Barrett, 2009).
In the debate about whether "emotion" can today function as a
scientific term, its semantic and conceptual history is, it seems to
me, relevant if not decisive. On the question of whether "emotion"
is a "folk" or "everyday" term rather than a scientific one, there is
a clear historical story to tell. "Emotion" has existed as a normal
English-language term for physical agitation since the 17th cen-
tury. It gradually started to be applied, in an undefined and general
way, to states of mental feeling during the 18th century. So, when
Brown and others adopted it as a term of mental science, they were
adopting an everyday term and giving it a new theoretical role. As
Brown himself put it: "Every person understands what is meant by
an emotion" (1820/2010, p. 145). In the course of the 19th and
20th centuries, this previously "everyday" word became a scien-
tific term used in technical ways not only in psychology, but also
in medicine, sociology, and anthropology. The final stage of this
semantic history has been the popularisation of ideas about "emo-
tional intelligence," "emotional literacy," and "emotional well-
being," which have themselves virtually become "everyday"
phrases. This process has seen scientific ideas about "emotion" and
the "emotional" becoming widely spread through popular culture
and politics, in a way that has traded on the scientific, psychological,
and medical authority of that language.
This complex cultural history of "emotion," especially its
rather recent, haphazard, contested, and gradual emergence as
an English-language psychological category in the first half of
the 19th century, does not strongly suggest that "emotion" is
likely to name either a natural kind or any kind of innate or
"folk" psychological concept (cf. Barrett, 2006; Rorty, 2004;
Wierzbicka, 2010). On the other hand, it may be that psychol-
ogy is not the kind of science that deals in natural kinds or innate
concepts. If the science of emotion is supposed to provide an
explanation of a widely experienced kind of mental state, and in
terms that can be communicated to the general public, then it
might be better to stick with the complexity, fuzziness, and
overinclusivity of "emotion" than to retreat still further from the
world of everyday concerns into new scientific jargons.
Let me end, however, on a constructive note, by suggesting a
third way between the retention of the problematic metacate-
gory of "emotion" and its abandonment in favour of studies of
discrete feeling states such as love, anger, fear, and the rest. In
the conclusion of my 2003 book on this subject I was rather
timid and suggested that the "old-fashioned terminology of pas-
sions and affections" was unlikely to "find favour in future psy-
chological theories" (Dixon, 2003, p. 245). But perhaps now
that the definitional crisis in "emotion" theories has reached a
new peak, the time has come to reinstate in psychological sci-
ence some version of that distinction between "passions" and
"affections" which structured modern thought about mind and
morality for so many centuries. Among philosophers of emo-
tion, Griffiths (1997, 2003, 2004) in particular has lamented the
overinclusivity of the modern category of "emotion" and argued
that it should be divided into two subcategories: the more prim-
itive "affect programs" and the "higher cognitive emotions" (cf.
Elster, 1999; Rorty, 2004). If the lessons of history and philoso-
phy are taken on board, then, it is just possible that the ideas of
Augustine and Aquinas might yet turn out to be just what is
needed to inspire a new scientific paradigm of emotions research
for the 21st century.
