ABSTRACT
The heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-1, the chondroitin
sulfate proteoglycan phosphacan/RPTP (receptor protein-
tyrosine phosphatase)-f/b and the extracellular matrix
protein tenascin-C were all found to be expressed by neural
stem cells and by neural cells derived from them. Expression of
proteoglycans and tenascin-C increased after retinoic acid
induction of SSEA1-positive ES (embryonic stem) cells to
nestin-positive neural stem cells, and after neural differenti-
ation, proteoglycans and tenascin-C are expressed by both
neurons and astrocytes, where they surround cell bodies and
processes and in certain cases show distinctive expression
patterns. With the exception of tenascin-C (whose expression
may decrease somewhat), expression levels do not change
noticeably during the following 2 weeks in culture. The
significant expression, by neural stem cells and neurons and
astrocytes derived from them, of two major heparan sulfate
and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans of nervous tissue and
of tenascin-C, a high-affinity ligand of phosphacan/RPTP-f/b,
indicates that an understanding of their specific functional
roles in stem cell neurobiology will be important for the
therapeutic application of this new technology in facilitating
nervous tissue repair and regeneration.
Key words: astrocyte, glypican, heparan sulfate, neuron,

INTRODUCTION
The potential use of stem cells for restoration of function in
the CNS (central nervous system) after injury, or as a result of
age-related degenerative and disease processes, is currently
an area of intensive investigation in neurobiology (Cao et al.,
2002; Lindvall and Kokaia, 2006; Dimos et al., 2008). Stem
cell-derived neural cell lines that will be most useful for
purposes of implantation include various types of clonally
derived cells that are capable of indefinite replication in
tissue culture and differentiation into neural cells (Gottlieb,
2002). Approaches for deriving neural cells from mouse ES
(embryonic stem) cells are also applicable to human
progenitor cells, and it appears that current tissue culture
methods can be readily perfected to allow the isolation of
highly purified preparations of the major neural cell types.
Stem cells are also advantageous for implantation research
because they can be used for the preparation of genetically
engineered cell lines, for which transfection protocols have
recently been optimized (Braam et al., 2008).
Because morphogenic signals co-ordinate major stem cell
decisions to regulate the size, shape and cellular diversity in
nervous tissue development (Panchision and McKay, 2002;
Krencik and Zhang, 2006; Muotri and Gage, 2006), it is clear
that the cellular and biochemical environment into which
such cells are introduced will play a critical role in deter-
mining their survival, migration patterns and expression of

differentiated functions. Proteoglycans and their extracellular
matrix ligands (for reviews, see Sugahara and Mikami, 2007;
Zimmermann and Dours-Zimmermann, 2008) are likely to
exert a decisive influence on stem cell behaviour. These
macromolecules would be derived both from the implanted
cells themselves and from the recipient tissue, possibly
resulting in reciprocal effects.
Glypican-1 is largely present as a glycosylphosphatidyl-
inositol-anchored cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan.
However, we have previously demonstrated that it contains a
nuclear localization signal, is present in the nuclei of CNS
neurons and is transported to the nuclei of 293, COS-1, and C6
glioma cells, which show changes in the pattern of glypican
nuclear immunoreactivity both during cell division and
correlated with different phases of the cell cycle (Liang et al.,
1997). These findings suggest that glypican-1 may be involved
in the regulation of cell division and survival by directly
participating in nuclear processes, possibly by facilitating the
transport of growth factors into the nucleus. Recent studies
have also shown that glypican-1 regulates anaphase-promot-
ing complex/cyclosome substrates and cell-cycle progression in
brain endothelial cells (Qiao et al., 2008), and that glypicans
play an essential role in the regulation of morphogen signalling
(e.g. by promoting internalization of Hedgehog; Beckett et al.,
2008).
Phosphacan is an mRNA splice variant representing the
entire extracellular portion of a transmembrane chondroitin
sulfate proteoglycan, RPTP (receptor protein-tyrosine phos-
phatase)-f/b, which is a high-affinity ligand of a number of
neural cell-adhesion molecules and of the extracellular matrix
protein tenascin-C (reviewed in Margolis and Margolis, 1997).
Although hyaluronan, the hyaluronan-binding chondroitin
sulfate proteoglycans and phosphacan are present in some or
all perineuronal nets (Carulli et al., 2007; Galtrey et al., 2008),
the dense extracellular matrix structures that develop around
many neuronal cell bodies late in development and are thought
to be involved in restricting experience-dependent synaptic
plasticity in the adult, phosphacan has also been detected very
early in CNS development at extrasynaptic sites prior to
synapse formation (Dino et al., 2006).
Tenascin-C was the first identified member of a highly
conserved family of four large multimodular extracellular matrix
glycoproteins found only in vertebrate organisms (for reviews, see
Hsia and Schwarzbauer, 2005; Tucker and Chiquet-Ehrismann,
2009). They have distinctive expression patterns (only tenascin-C
and tenascin-R are present in nervous tissue) and all of the
tenascins share the characteristics of having tightly regulated
expression both during development and throughout the life of
an organism, and of modulating cell­matrix interactions and
mediating cell adhesion in a manner that promotes cell motility.
We have previously demonstrat-
ed that the fibrinogen-like globe of tenascin-C mediates its high-
affinity interactions with the core proteins of two chondroitin
sulfate proteoglycans that are characteristic of nervous tissue
(neurocan and phosphacan/RPTP-f/b) and have potent effects on
neural cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth (Milev et al., 1997).
Because proteoglycans and their cell surface or extracellular
matrix ligands can be expected to have major effects on stem cell
behaviour, we have examined the expression of glypican-1,
phosphacan/RPTP-f/b and tenascin-C by neural stem cells and
differentiated neurons and glia derived from them.
EXPERIMENTAL
Antibodies
Rabbit antisera to phosphacan (Milev et al., 1994) and
glypican-1 (Liang et al., 1997) have been described previously.
Anti-tenascin-C, prepared by immunizing rabbits with
tenascin-C purified from the U-251 MG human glioma cell
line (Bourdon et al., 1985), was generously provided by Dr
Mario Bourdon (La Jolla Institute for Molecular Medicine).
The antisera had been adsorbed against serum proteins,
fibronectin and laminin and found to be tenascin-C specific
on ELISA and in immunoblots of total proteins from 1-day
postnatal, 15-day and adult rat brain.
Antibodies to mouse GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein;
MAB360), b-III tubulin (MAB1637) and the O4 oligodendro-
cyte marker (MAB345) were all obtained from Chemicon
(Temecula, CA, U.S.A.). Secondary antibodies (FITC goat anti-
rabbit IgG and Texas Red goat anti-mouse IgG or IgM) were
obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA,
U.S.A.). The MC-480 antibody to SSEA-1 and the Rat-401
antibody to nestin were obtained from the Developmental
Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA, U.S.A.).
Cell culture media and other chemicals
DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) with high
glucose (11960-069), MEM (minimal essential medium) non-
essential amino acids (11140-050), MEM sodium pyruvate
(11360-070), L-glutamine (25030-081), penicillin/streptomycin
(15140-122) and trypsin/EDTA (25300-054) were all obtained
from Gibco/Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.). ES Qualified fetal
bovine serum (100-125) was from Gemini Bio-Products
(Woodland, CA, U.S.A.). LIF (leukaemia inhibitory factor;
ESG1107, ESGRO) was obtained from Chemicon.
Culture of mouse ES cells
Mouse ES and EMFI cells were obtained from the Alexandra
Joyner laboratory (NYU Medical Center) and cultured as
described by Matise et al. (2000). Mitomycin C-treated primary
mouse embryonic fibroblast (EMFI) feeder cells (Doetschman
et al., 1985) were plated on to dishes in EMFI medium [DMEM
containing 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium
pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 15% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum and 50 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin]. The
following day, W4/129S6 ES cells (Auerbach et al., 2000) were

suspended in ES cell medium (EMFI medium containing 2-
mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM, and LIF, 1000 units/ml) and plated
on the feeder layer. The ES cells (from a stock used to make
knockout mice and thus demonstrably normal) were propa-
gated for only a limited time (,1 month) before starting with
new frozen stocks to avoid working with karyotypic variants.
After 24 h in culture (65­70% confluent) the medium was
replaced, and after a further 24 h, the cells (90­95% confluent)
were plated on to 10 cm dishes (Nunc; 1-50679) coated with
0.1% bovine skin gelatin (Sigma; G9391) and maintained in
this manner with a further replating over the following 3 days.
Culture of feeder-independent mouse ES cells
The feeder-free E14Tg2a.4 mouse ES cell line was obtained
from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (Davis, CA,
U.S.A.) and cultured in a manner very similar to that described
above, with some minor differences in medium composition,
trypsinization and gelatin coating of plates (Brennan and
Skarnes, 1999; Skarnes, 2000). Differentiation and subsequent
steps were performed exactly as described below for the W4/
129S6 cell line.
Neural induction
Neural differentiation of ES cells was performed by the general
procedure of Bain et al. (1998), but using the slightly simplified
EMFI medium described above. ES cells were detached by
mild trypsinization in EMFI medium and placed in suspension
culture in dishes (Corning; 430591) coated with 0.1% agar
(Gibco/BRL; M00391B). After 48 h they were transferred to
fresh EMFI medium after gravity sedimentation (10 min in
15 ml conical tubes) and replated in the same dish. Two days
later they were transferred by sedimentation to EMFI medium
containing 0.6 mM all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma; R2625), and
the medium was changed after a further 2 days. (During the
4-day period when cells were cultured in suspension with
retinoic acid, the second day is referred to as day 2+ and the
fourth and final day of the retinoic acid treatment as day 4+.)
At days 2+ and 4+, and 9 days after beginning the retinoic acid
induction, cells were seeded on to glass coverslips coated with
0.1 mg/ml poly-D-lysine (molecular mass .300000 Da; Sigma;
P1024) in a 24-well plate (Corning; 3527; 0.5­16106 cells per
well). Differentiated cells were maintained for up to 2 weeks
for immunocytochemistry.
Immunocytochemistry
Semi-quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy was
employed to evaluate proteoglycan expression, due to its
greater resolution (at essentially the single cell level) compared
with biochemical procedures based on total cell protein, and in
view of substantial technical obstacles to accurate quantifica-
tion of large proteoglycan core proteins by techniques such
as immunoblotting. Cells on coverslips were washed with PBS
and fixed for 30 min at room temperature (25°C) with 3% (w/v)
paraformaldehyde. After washing for 365 min with PBS,
cells were treated for 1 h at room temperature with 5% BSA in
PBS, and for immunocytochemical detection of intracellular
markers (e.g. tubulin and GFAP) cells were permeabilized by
inclusion of 0.2% Triton X-100 in the BSA blocking solution.
Cells were treated overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber
with primary antibodies in BSA blocking solution, washed for
365 min with PBS and treated for 1 h at room temperature
(25°C) with FITC- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibod-
ies in blocking solution. After 365 min washes with PBS,
nuclei were stained by treatment for 30 min at room
temperature with TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen,
1 mg/ml in PBS), washed for 365 min with PBS and the
coverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.). Confocal imaging was
performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope with a Plan-
Neofluar 640 oil immersion objective.
RESULTS
Studies were performed using both the W4/129S6 cell line
and a mouse ES cell line (E14Tg2a.4) that does not require a
feeder layer. Examination of proteoglycan and tenascin-C
expressions gave identical results in both the cases (e.g. most
results were obtained with the W4 cells, but those shown in
Figures 1 and 3(D)­3(F) were obtained with the feeder-
independent E14T cell line).
Glypican-1, phosphacan/RPTP-f/b and tenascin-C were
weakly expressed in the SSEA-positive, nestin-negative ES
cells (Figures 1A, 1D and 1G), and on the second day of
retinoic acid treatment, SSEA-1 staining decreased and nestin
staining first appears (Figure 1L), but neither tubulin nor
GFAP is detectable. Proteoglycan and tenascin-C staining
(Figures 1B, 1E and 1H) has, however, increased in intensity as
compared with the ES cells. On day 4 of the retinoic acid
treatment, only a small proportion of cells still show SSEA-1
staining, whereas almost all are strongly nestin positive
(Figure 1M). There is also significant proteoglycan and
tenascin-C expression in these neural stem cells (Figures 1C,
1F and 1J), as well as the first appearance of b-tubulin,
although GFAP is still absent (Figure 1C). By 1 day after
replating (`differentiated day 1' after the retinoic acid neural
induction) most cells are strongly nestin-positive and there is
similarly strong staining of b-tubulin, whereas significant
staining of GFAP did not usually appear until day 4 of
differentiation (the next time point examined), at which time
nestin has greatly decreased. The neural induction protocol
used in the present study yielded only a very small proportion
of oligodendrocytes expressing the O4 marker. For the
Figures, we selected fields that illustrate the range of
neuronal and glial morphologies observed in our study.
Thus, not all neurons or glia (identified by appropriate
differentiation markers) will have the same appearance.

widespread groups of cells (Figures 4D­4F). It is also
associated with astrocytes (Figures 4G­4J).
Cells were examined at 1, 4, 7, 10 and 14 days post-
differentiation, and although most of the fields selected to
show expression of proteoglycans were from 4-day post-
differentiation cultures, there was no clear trend of increased
or decreased proteoglycan expression as a function of time
after differentiation. However, expression of tenascin-C
appeared to be greatest early after differentiation.
DISCUSSION
Most previous studies of glycoconjugates in neural stem/
progenitor cells have concerned glycolipids and glycopro-
teins, with relatively little information being available on
proteoglycans and associated extracellular matrix molecules
(reviewed by Yanagisawa and Yu, 2007). However, microarray
studies comparing acutely isolated human brain A2B5+ pro-
genitor cells with an unsorted white matter dissociate from
which they were obtained demonstrated a 5­10-fold greater
expression of the gene for phosphacan/RPTP-f/b in the pro-
genitor cells (Sim et al., 2006). In other studies based on SDS/
PAGE and immunoblotting, mouse neural precursor cells grown
as neurospheres have been reported to secrete phosphacan and
aggrecan into the medium, and genes for aggrecan, neurocan,
brevican, phosphacan and tenascin-C could be amplified from
mouse neurospheres by RT­PCR (reverse transcription­PCR;
Kabos et al., 2004). Immunocytochemical studies also indicated
that chondroitin sulfate surrounded nestin-positive cells or
neural stem/progenitor cells in the rat ventricular zone of the
telencephalon at embryonic day 14, and the chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycans neurocan, phosphacan/RPTP-f/b and neurogly-
can C, were detected in the ventricular zone (Ida et al., 2006).

Neurospheres formed by cells from the fetal telencephalon also
expressed these chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. However,
all of these studies have concerned neurosphere-forming stem
and progenitor cells isolated from fetal tissue, which are known
to differ in many significant respects from neural stem cells
derived from ES cells (Shin et al., 2007). These latter cells, which
are derived from the inner cell mass of preimplantation mam-
malian embryos, are a unique population of pluripotent cells
that can differentiate into the embryonic precursors of all adult
tissues. Moreover, most of these studies examined only gene
expression, which may not reflect the actual expression of the
corresponding protein(s).
The glycosaminoglycan chains of cell-surface heparan
sulfate proteoglycans are ubiquitous elements of the stem
cell `niche' (i.e. the histologically defined microenvironment
for stem cell regulation), and there is evidence that they play
an important role in regulating extrinsic signalling pathways
required for ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency (Nurcombe
and Cool, 2007; Sasaki et al., 2008). Insofar as large changes
in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and fine structure occur as
murine ES cells differentiate to embryoid bodies and
extraembryonic endoderm (Nairn et al., 2007) or to neural
progenitor cells (Johnson et al., 2007), early developmental
alterations in, for example, glypican-1 heparan sulfate fine
structure, may modulate growth-factor binding, and thereby
affect morphogenetic signalling processes critical for neural
stem cell proliferation and differentiation.
Major ligands of glypican-1 in the CNS are the Slit pro-
teins, which regulate axonal guidance, branching, dendritic
development and neural migration, and with which glypican-
1 co-localizes in brain (Liang et al., 1999; Ronca et al., 2001).
In addition to earlier evidence for the role of cell-surface
heparan sulfate in the repulsive guidance activities of Slit-2
protein, it is known that both Slit-2 and glypican-1 mRNAs are
strongly up-regulated and co-expressed in the reactive astro-
cytes of injured adult brain, suggesting a possible function of

Slit proteins and glypican-1 in the adult CNS (where few axon
guidance events occur) as significant components of the in-
hibitory environment after injury. It is therefore possible that
glypican-1 and Slit proteins, either acting alone or as a complex,
are a significant factor in inhibiting axonal regeneration after
spinal cord injury (Zhang et al., 2004; Lau and Margolis, 2010), a
condition for which there has been much interest in the possible
therapeutic use of ES cells.
Studies of neural stem cells in the subependymal zone of
adult mouse brain have shown that the neural stem cell niche
functions properly in the absence of tenascin-C, suggesting
that this major extracellular matrix protein does not play a
significant role in adult neurogenesis (Kazanis et al., 2007).
However, recent induction gene trap studies of tenascin-C
in neural stem cells indicate that its functions may be
instructive rather than permissive or redundant, and that its
absence leads to only marginal defects that the stem cell
niche can compensate for as a functional, integrative entity
(von Holst, 2008). Of the 64 theoretically possible tenascin-C
isoforms that could be generated by alternative splicing, 20
have been described in neural stem cells maintained as
neurospheres, where their expression is differentially regu-
lated by Pax6 (von Holst et al., 2007). Although the functional
significance of these various alternatively spliced tenascin-C
domains is not yet clear, they may contribute to the for-
mation of slightly different microenvironments within the
neural stem cell niche (von Holst, 2008). It is also of interest
that the transcript level of tenascin-C increased ,100-fold
after the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of ES cells to
extra-embryonic endoderm (Nairn et al., 2007).
In the work reported here, we have demonstrated that ES
cells differentiated to neural stem cells and then along
neuronal and astroglial pathways produce chondroitin sulfate
and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, as well as tenascin-C,
a high-affinity extracellular matrix ligand of phosphacan. In a
recent study demonstrating structural alterations in heparan

sulfate during the differentiation of ES cells to Sox1-
expressing neural progenitor cells, their transcription profiles
were also compared by screening total RNA isolated from the
cell populations for the presence of mRNA from a wide range
of glycosaminoglycan synthetic enzyme and proteoglycan
core protein genes (Johnson et al., 2007). Consistent with our
results, RT­PCR detected expression of proteoglycan core
proteins in both undifferentiated cells and in those expressing
Sox1 (the earliest known specific marker of neuroectodermal
precursors, before their differentiation into neurons and glia).
Therefore even proteoglycans such as phosphacan that are
considered as characteristic of nervous tissue are expressed at
very early developmental stages. It should also be noted in
this connection that the transcript abundance of phospha-
can/RPTP-f/b increased ,10-fold after the differentiation of
ES cells to embryoid bodies, but was essentially absent when
the stem cells were differentiated to extra-embryonic
endoderm (Nairn et al., 2007). Moreover, recent studies have
revealed a novel mechanism of axonal degeneration after
spinal cord injury, involving protein tyrosine phosphatases
that can be targeted with small molecule inhibitors that exert
a neuroprotective effect (Nakashima et al., 2008). These
results suggest that phosphacan/RPTP-f/b expressed by
neural stem cells and neural cells derived from them may
be significant in relation to the potential use of implanted
neural stem cells for the treatment of spinal cord injury. It
can be expected that future studies will clarify the specific
neurodevelopmental roles of these proteoglycans and their
associated ligands in stem cell populations, and how these
interactions can be used to advantage in the therapeutic
application of neural stem cells for the treatment of injury,
degeneration and aging in the CNS.
