Adolescents and young adults are exposed to portrayals of
human sexuality through a broad range of media outlets
(Wright, 2009). Although these media portrayals likely
reflect current cultural norms related to sexuality, they may
also help shape young people's sexual attitudes and sexual
scripts, especially given a lack of personal experience to
draw upon (cf. Huston et al., 1992). In fact, U.S. teens rank
mass media as one of the most important sources of sexual
information (Sutton, Brown, Wilson, & Klein, 2002). Popular
music contains more sexual content than other forms of
media directed toward young people (Pardun, L'Engle, &
Brown, 2005), and music is among the most popular forms
of media for this age group (Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts,
2010). A 2008/2009 U.S. poll found that 8- to 18-year olds
spent an average of 16 hr a week listening to music, a large
increase over previous years (Rideout et al., 2010).
Studies have documented relatively high rates of sexual
content in popular music. For instance, more than a third of
popular songs in 2005 contained references to sexual activity
(Primack, Gold, Schwarz, & Dalton, 2008). The sexual con-
tent of popular music tends to reflect stereotyped gender
roles, with women presented as sexual objects for the plea-
sure of men. For instance, in music videos, women (both art-
ists and secondary characters in the videos) are much more
likely than men to be scantily clad, to be held to strict stan-
dards of physical attractiveness, and to be shown dancing in
a sexually provocative manner (Aubrey & Frisby, 2011).
Moreover, sexual content varies by musical genre, with rap
music tending to feature the highest levels of sexual
objectification of women and country music featuring the
lowest levels (e.g., Aubrey & Frisby, 2011; Primack et al.,
2008). Moreover, hip-hop and rap lyrics are more likely to
display men as hyper-masculine and sex-focused than are
other genres (Ward, 2013). Of particular concern, there is
evidence that exposure to sexually explicit music and music
videos is associated with more permissive sexual attitudes,
behavior, and intentions among young adults (Pardun et al.,
2005; Zhang, Miller, & Harrison, 2008). Moreover, some
initial evidence suggests that exposure to objectifying and
degrading music in early adolescence may increase the like-
lihood of early sexual activity (Martino et al., 2006).
Not surprisingly, popular music has changed over time
within Western society. For example, since the 1960s, popu-
lar music has become sadder-sounding (Schellenberg & von
Scheve, 2012), as well as louder and less variable in pitch
and timbre (Serrà, Corral, Boguñá, Haro, & Arcos, 2012).
Content analyses of music lyrics have indicated increases
over the past 30 years in self-focused and antisocial words
(DeWall, Pond, Campbell, & Twenge, 2011) and in refer-
ences to alcohol and other recreational substances
(Christenson, Roberts, & Bjork, 2012). However, just one
study has examined long-term changes in the sexual content

Themes of Lust and Love in Popular Music
Lyrics From 1971 to 2011
Yasaman Madanikia1 and Kim Bartholomew1
Abstract
We explored themes related to sexual desire (lust) and romantic desire (love) in the lyrics of popular music over the past
40 years. We examined whether there have been changes in the prevalence of lust and love themes and changes in how
these themes inter-relate in music lyrics over time. The study sample consisted of the top 40 songs of Billboard Year End Hot
100 single songs for every 5 years from 1971 to 2011 (N = 360). There was a linear decrease over time in the proportion of
songs with a love theme and in the proportion of songs with a combination of lust and love themes. In contrast, there was
a significant increase in the proportion of songs with a theme focusing on lust in the absence of love. Themes of lust in the
absence of love were especially prevalent in hip-hop/rap music, although music genre did not account for the changing themes
over time. These shifts in themes found in popular music may both influence cultural norms and reflect a cultural shift toward
acceptance of sexuality outside of love relationships.

of popular music. Hall, West, and Hill (2012) examined sex-
ualization, primarily defined as the sexual objectification of
others, in the lyrics of popular songs from 1959 to 2009 (at
10-year intervals). The proportion of songs with sexualiza-
tion content did not increase from 1959 to 1989, staying in
the range of 6% to 11%; in contrast, there was a jump in the
proportion of songs including sexualization to 27% in 2009
(Hall et al., 2012). Although songs performed by men and by
non-White artists were more likely to contain sexualization
than those performed by women and White artists, the 2009
increase in sexualization was observed independently of art-
ist demographics.
Prior studies focusing on the sexual content of popular
music have taken varied approaches to coding sexual con-
tent. Often researchers have coded whether song lyrics or
videos contain references to specific sexual acts or specific
body parts (e.g., Aubrey & Frisby, 2011; Hall et al., 2012). In
some studies, researchers have combined any indications of
sexuality (including presentation of dating, kissing, nudity,
sexual intercourse, etc.), based on some findings that overall
proportion of sexual content is more important than the par-
ticular form of sexuality shown (e.g., Brown et al., 2006;
Pardun et al., 2005). In other studies, researchers have distin-
guished between objectifying or degrading sexual content
and less offensive sexual content based on the expectation
that it is objectifying content that is likely to have a more
detrimental effect on adolescents' attitudes, scripts, and
behaviors (e.g., Martino et al., 2006; Primack, Douglas, Fine,
& Dalton, 2009). However, sexualization, objectification,
and degradation are conceptualized differently across studies
and have often been defined quite broadly. For example, Hall
et al. (2012) included evidence of a large sexual appetite as
an indicator of sexualized lyrics (also referred to as degrad-
ing lyrics), and Aubrey and Frisby (2011) considered an art-
ist engaging in provocative dance to be objectifying
themselves. Moreover, there was a strong overlap between
rating lyrics as degrading and as being about casual sex in
Martino and colleagues' (2006) study of teen music con-
sumption, suggesting that casual and explicit sexual refer-
ences were, with few exceptions, categorized as degrading.
Current Study
There is widespread public concern that sexual content is
increasing in the media, and that this content may have harm-
ful effects on impressionable youth (Hetsroni, 2007).
Moreover, there is growing evidence that sexual content in
popular media, including popular music, can help to shape
viewers' conceptions of sexuality and sexual behavior (e.g.,
Bleakley, Hennessy, Fishbein, & Jordan, 2008; Martino et
al., 2006; Pardun et al., 2005). Therefore, a longitudinal
study of sexual content in music lyrics can help provide a
historical perspective on the current state of sexuality in pop-
ular music, as well as helping to anticipate future trends.
However, there is limited information on long-term trends in
the depiction of sexuality in popular music. Although a few
studies have considered trends based on qualitative analyses
and/or over just a few years (e.g., Bretthauer, Zimmerman, &
Banning, 2007), only Hall et al. (2012) have systematically
assessed sexualization in the lyrics of popular music over a
period of decades.
We sought to conceptually replicate Hall et al.'s (2012)
study of sexualization in the lyrics of popular music over 40
years, as well as to extend and build on this work. First, we
took a somewhat different approach to coding the sexual
content of music lyrics. Rather than coding specific sexual
acts or making difficult judgments about whether particular
lyrics are objectifying or degrading, we assessed the underly-
ing themes presented in music lyrics. We examined whether
songs included an expression of sexual desire for another
person or persons, what we refer to as a theme of lust.
Second, in addition to considering sexual themes in music
lyrics, we considered whether there have been any shifts in
the prevalence with which songs deal with themes of roman-
tic love. By considering both lust and love themes in popular
music, we were able to examine whether there have been
changes in how these two themes inter-relate in music lyrics
over time. Finally, we assessed music lyrics at 5-year inter-
vals, rather than 10-year intervals, as done by Hall et al.
(2012), in the hope that this would provide a clearer picture
of any changes over time.
We also considered two potential mediators of any
changes in the themes found in popular music over time: art-
ist gender and musical genre. Based on previous research
indicating that male artists are more likely than female artists
to sing songs with sexualized and degrading lyrics (e.g., Hall
et al., 2012), we examined whether artist gender was related
to lust and love themes in popular music and, in turn, whether
artist gender accounted for changes in lust and love themes
over time. Based on previous research suggesting that sexual
objectification is more common in some musical genres than
others (e.g., Aubrey & Frisby, 2011), we examined whether
genre was related to lust and love themes in popular music
and, in turn, whether genre accounted for changes in lust and
love themes over time.
To summarize our research questions,
Research Question 1: Have themes related to lust and
love, and how these themes inter-relate, changed in popu-
lar music lyrics from 1971 to 2011?
Research Question 2: Is artist gender related to lust and
love themes in popular music, and do changes in artist
gender account for changes in these themes from 1971 to
2011?
Research Question 3: Is music genre related to lust and
love themes in popular music, and do changes in music
genres account for changes in these themes from 1971 to
2011?

Method
Procedure
We identified the top 40 songs from the Billboard Year End
Hot Top 100 single Charts using Billboard Top 100 (n.d.).
Billboard Charts rank songs according to sales and down-
loads, frequency of radio airplay in the United States, and
frequency of digital streaming. The final sample consisted of
the lyrics of the top 40 songs of the following 9 years: 1971,
1976, 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2011 (the
most recent year available when data collection began).
There were three song lyrics with non-English content: one
in German and two a combination of English and Spanish.
The non-English lyrics were translated into English with
Google Translate, and a native speaker of each non-English
language then reviewed the translations and made any neces-
sary revisions.
Song lyrics were coded for references to the themes of
lust and love. Two coders first reviewed lyrics from 40 songs
not included in the sample to clarify the codes and establish
an acceptable level of reliability. One coder (the first author)
coded all lyrics in the target sample. A second coder coded
the lyrics for 3 years (1971, 1986, and 2011; n = 120 songs)
as a reliability check. Reliability for the categorical lust and
love themes was assessed via percent agreement and Cohen's
Kappa.
Measures
Lust. The theme of lust was defined as expressions of sexual
desire or longing for another person or persons. A lust theme
may or may not include explicit references to sexual acts or
to sexually attractive characteristics of the person of interest.
As well, a lust theme could take place in a variety of rela-
tional contexts, including no contact with the desired person
(e.g., observing the person dancing in a club), a casual sexual
encounter with the desired person, and an ongoing romantic
relationship with the desired person. Thus, the lust theme
may or may not take place within the context of a loving
relationship. Percent agreement was .88 for the lust theme
(Kappa = .76).
Love.The theme of love was defined as expressions of
romantic love or caring for a potential, current, or past
romantic partner, as well as any content that involved a
romantic relationship. The theme of love may or may not
also involve expressions of sexual desire. Percent agreement
was .94 for the love theme (Kappa = .88).
Secondary variables. To allow us to explore how lust and love
themes may relate to one another over time, we derived three
additional secondary codes based on the primary lust and
love coded variables. Lyrics that contained the love theme,
but not the lust theme, were classified as love only. For
example, a lyric expressing love to a desired, actual, or past
love interest without any expression of sexual desire would
be classified as love only (see Table 1 for an example lyric).
Conversely, lyrics that contained the lust theme, but not the
love theme, were classified as lust only. For example, a lyric
focusing on sexual desire toward a desired or actual sexual
partner, with no accompanying expression of caring or lov-
ing, would be classified as lust only (see Table 1 for an exam-
ple lyric). Finally, lyrics that contained both lust and love
themes were classified as combined lust and love. For exam-
ple, a lyric expressing a combination of both sexual desire
and love for a romantic partner would be classified as com-
bined lust and love (see Table 1 for an example lyric).
Gender of artist. Gender of the recording artist was coded as
either male (for male soloists or all-male duos/groups),
female (for female soloists or all-female duos/groups), or
combined gender (duos or groups).
Musical genre. Because there are no sources that categorize
all individual songs by genre, we used the genre of the per-
forming artist as an indicator of the song genre. Artist genre
was determined through iTunes 11.1.3. Each artist was cate-
gorized under one of the following genres: pop, rock, dance,
hip-hop/rap, R&B/soul, alternative, country, jazz, musique
francophone, reggae, electronic, foreign, Latino, singer/song
writer, inspirational, vocal, and blues. Thus, artists were
identified by their main genre only. Songs performed by mul-
tiple artists from different genres were given multiple genre
codes.
Results
To analyze potential changes in the proportion of lyrics with
various themes over the 9 years studied, we undertook a series
of ANOVAs with year as the independent variable and theme
codes as the dependent variables. We considered unweighted
linear, quadratic, and cubic trends over time. In reporting
results, we describe significant trends over time only.
Lust and Love Themes
Prevalence of themes.To clarify associations between the
two primary themes coded (lust and love), we have presented
the proportion of the music lyrics with each theme in
Table 2.1 Across the entire sample, 80% of lyrics contained
themes of lust and/or love, with 39% of lyrics containing a
theme of lust and 62% containing a theme of love (as indi-
cated by the marginal proportions). The secondary classifica-
tions (lust only, love only, and combined lust/love) indicate
how the two primary codes inter-relate. Specifically, 19% of
lyrics showed lust only (with no love theme), 42% showed
love only (with no lust theme), and 20% of music lyrics con-
tained themes of both lust and love. Thus, about half of lyrics
with lust themes also had love themes, whereas about one
third of lyrics with love themes also had lust themes.

that lyrics with love only themes increased through the 1970s
and then began to decrease in the most recent periods,
F(1, 350) = 8.82, p < .01.
Combined lust and love. As illustrated in Figure 2, the propor-
tion of lyrics with combined themes of lust and love showed
a linear decrease over time, F(1, 350) = 6.39, p < .05.
Gender of Artist
Across the entire sample, 57% of songs were performed by
men, 30% were performed by women, and 13% of songs
were performed by combined gender artists. There was a lin-
ear trend toward an increasing proportion of women artists,
F(1, 351) = 7.81, p < .01, and a decreasing proportion of
male artists, F(1, 351) = 4.11, p < .05, over the study period
(1971-2011). However, there were no significant associa-
tions between artist gender and any of the identified themes
(lust, love, lust only, love only, or combined lust/love). For
instance, lyrics coded as lust only made up 19% of songs
performed by male artists, 16% of songs performed by
female artists, and 28% of songs performed by combined
gender artists. We repeated all of the analyses examining
changes in themes over time controlling for gender of artist
and the findings remained unchanged. Thus, gender of artist
did not account for the systematic changes in lust and love
themes in popular music over time.
Music Genre
The breakdown by genre across the entire sample was as fol-
lows: 43% pop, 19% rock, 18% R&B/soul, 12% hip-hop/rap,
4% dance, 4% country, 2% alternative, and 6% other.2 There
were some systematic shifts in song genres appearing in the
top 40 songs of Billboard Year End Hot 100 over time.
Specifically, hip-hop/rap, F(1, 351) = 66.62, p < .001; pop,
F(1, 351) = 5.92, p < .05; and alternative, F(1, 351) = 6.36,
p < .05, became more common, whereas rock, F(1, 351) =
13.74, p < .001, became less common. Just two genres were
associated with the lust and love themes. Hip-hop/rap was
strongly associated with less love (24% vs. 67% in all other
genres) and love only (5% vs. 46% in other genres) themes,
and more lust (74% vs. 34% in other genres) and lust only
(55% vs. 14% in other genres) themes, ts(357) ranged from
5.08 to 6.67, all ps < .001. In contrast, rock was associated
with less lust (25% vs. 42% in all other genres) and lust only
(6% vs. 22% in other genres) themes, t(357) = 2.65, p < .05
and t(357) = 3.08, p < .01, respectively.
We repeated all of the analyses examining changes in
themes over time controlling for the hip-hop/rap and rock
genres. We did not control for the other genres because they
were not related to music themes and therefore could not
mediate changes in themes over time. Rock had minimal
impact on changes in themes over time, with all findings
remaining unchanged. Although the hip-hop/rap genre
accounted for significant variation in all themes other than
combined lust/love, controlling for this genre did not alter
the general pattern of previously reported changes in
themes over time. Notably, all linear trends remained the
same--with love and combined lust/love decreasing over
time and lust only increasing over time. Thus, music genre
did not account for the shifts in lust and love themes over
time.
Discussion
We examined themes related to lust, the expression of sexual
desire, and love, the expression of romantic desire, in the lyr-
ics of the 40 most popular songs over the past 40 years.
Themes of love were more common than those of lust, with
62% of lyrics containing a love theme and 39% containing a
lust theme across the entire sample of songs. Contrary to the
general trend in Western society toward an increased visibil-
ity and accessibility of sexual content across multiple soci-
etal domains (Attwood, 2009), we did not find that themes of
lust increased systematically over the study period. However,
the proportion of songs with a theme of love did decrease
over the study period. Interestingly, moving into this century,
the proportion of songs with themes of lust became compa-
rable with, and even surpassed, the proportion of songs with
themes of love.
The shift in lyric themes was clarified by examining how
the themes of lust and love inter-related over time. From the
1970s through the 1990s, themes of love without any sexual
overtures were most common, followed by combined themes
of lust and love. From 2001 onward, we observed a shift
toward themes of lust only becoming more common and out-
stripping themes of lust and love combined. Put another way,
there was a notable shift from lust themes being presented in
the context of romantic feelings toward lust themes being
presented in the absence of romance. We suspect that these
changes reflect a growing cultural acceptance of sexuality
outside of the constraints of committed romantic relation-
ships (Garcia, Reiber, Massey, & Merriwether, 2012).

Our findings are broadly consistent with Hall et al.'s
(2012) study of sexualization in the Billboard Top 100 music
lyrics from 1959 to 2009 (at 10-year intervals). Sexualization
was defined largely in terms of sexual objectification,
whereby a person's value comes from his or her physical
attractiveness and sexual appeal. We expect that sexualiza-
tion would overlap substantially with lust only themes within
our coding system because sexual desire in the absence of a
relational context or romantic interest is most likely objecti-
fying (that is, only physical attraction comes into play). Hall
et al. (2012) found that sexualization did not increase from
1959 to 1999, then jumped substantially in 2009; consistent
with this pattern, we observed a notable increase in lust only
themes from 2001 onward. Our findings build on those of
Hall et al.'s (2012) by suggesting that the increase in objecti-
fying sexual content is not a function of a general increase in
sexual content, but rather stems from a drop in romantic con-
tent and a disentangling of sexual content from romantic
content.
Shifts in themes of lust and love in music lyrics likely
reflect cultural changes in attitudes toward sexual and roman-
tic relationships. We also considered other factors, specifi-
cally gender of the performing artists and changes in the
popularity of musical genres, which might play a role. In the
current study, artist gender was not associated with themes of
lust and love. In contrast, Hall et al. (2012) found that male
artists were more likely to perform songs containing sexual-
ization, although this effect was modest (male artists 14%,
female artists 7%, and combined artists 13%). It is difficult to
directly compare the current findings with those of Hall et al.
(2012) because of different coding methods, samples, and
time points. As well, our smaller sample size (n = 360 vs. n =
600 lyrics) may have compromised the power of our study to
detect small effects. Most importantly, however, in neither
study did artist gender account for the observed changes in
the sexual content of popular song lyrics over time.
There have been systematic shifts in the genre makeup of
the top 40 songs of Billboard Year End Hot 100 over the past
40 years. Based on iTunes genre classifications, songs in the
hip-hop/rap, pop, and alternative genres have become
increasingly prevalent in the top 40, whereas rock has
become less prevalent. However, just two genres were asso-
ciated with lust and love themes. Most notably, compared
with all other music genres, hip-hop and rap songs contained
fewer love themes (both love and love only) and more lust
themes (both lust and lust only). In fact, lust only themes
were four times as likely to be found in hip-hop/rap music as
in other musical genres. Consistent with this finding, previ-
ous research has documented more references to objectifying
and degrading sex in rap music than in other popular genres
(Aubrey & Frisby, 2011; Martino et al., 2006; Primack et al.,
2008). In contrast, rock music tended to contain fewer themes
of lust and lust only than other musical genres. However, in
spite of the strikingly high incidence of lust-related themes in
the hip-hop/rap genre, song genre did not account for the
observed changes in themes of lust and love in popular music
over time.
The current findings may have implications for research
investigating the potential impacts of sexual references in
popular music. Martino et al. (2006) found that teen con-
sumption of music with degrading sexual references, a desig-
nation that largely overlaps with sex in a casual content as is
common in hip-hop and rap music, was prospectively related
to initiation of sexual activity. In contrast, consumption of
music with non-degrading sexual references, largely sex
within a relational context as is common in rock music, was
not associated with earlier sexual activity (Martino et al.,
2006). These effects can be understood in terms of observa-
tional learning (Bandura, 1977), whereby adolescents learn
and internalize sexual attitudes and behaviors depicted in
media. Moreover, according to cultivation theory (Gerber,
Gross, Morgan, & Signorielli, 1994), adolescents can come
to believe that media reflects actual normative experiences of
sexuality. Thus, lyrics with lust only themes may influence
the attitudes and behavior of some young listeners, perhaps
normalizing casual sex and earlier sex. Moreover, our find-
ings suggest that such non-relational sexual content has
become increasingly prevalent in the most popular music.
On the other hand, experimental studies of the impact of
degrading music on sexual attitudes have been inconsistent
at best (e.g., Alcorn & Lemieux, 2011; Sprankle & End,
2009; Sprankle, End, & Bretz, 2012; Wester, Crown,
Quatman, & Heesacker, 1997). As well, findings of other
correlational studies indicate that adolescents' exposure to
sexual media content in general, regardless of the particular
forms or themes of sexuality portrayed, is associated with
their sexual activity, intentions, and normative perceptions
(e.g., Brown et al., 2006; Pardun et al., 2005). If the preva-
lence of sexuality in any form is of most relevance, then con-
cerns about the increased sexualization of popular music
may be unfounded given that sexual themes have not
increased systematically in popular music in the past 40
years.
Limitations and Future Directions
We assessed song lyrics every 5 years over the past 40 years
to explore changes in the themes of popular songs. It is pos-
sible that some time-related changes between the chosen data
points have been overlooked. Although 5-year intervals do
provide a somewhat more detailed portrait than 10-year
intervals (for instance, as used by Hall et al. [2012)] and
Christenson et al. [2012]), it would be ideal to include popu-
lar songs for every year of the time period under study. In
particular, more fine-grained analyses might help to clarify
the major shift in sexual and romantic themes that appears to
have taken place around the beginning of the 21st century.
We examined only the top 40 songs of the top 100 songs
of each year. Inclusion of the top 100 songs would have
allowed for greater generalization to all popular music. As

well, this approach systematically underrepresented some
genres of music that are popular with subgroups of the popu-
lation, but that are not well represented in the Billboard
charts. For instance, sexual objectification is quite rare in
country music (Aubrey & Frisby, 2011; Primack et al., 2008),
which accounted for only 4% of songs in the current study.
Thus, we expect that a broader sampling of musical genres
may have revealed a lower level of lust themes than we
uncovered. On the other hand, the top 40 songs of Billboard
Year End Hot 100 represent those songs that are most popu-
lar, and therefore potentially most influential, among adoles-
cents and young adults.
More broadly, popular music is just one form of media,
and other media such as television and cinema may differ in
their depictions of sex and love over time (Wright, 2009).
Interestingly, studies assessing changes in sexual content in
teen-centered films and in prime-time television over the
past three decades have failed to confirm the common
assumption that sexual content is increasing across a range of
media (Callister, Stern, Coyne, Robinson, & Bennion, 2011;
Hetsroni, 2007), although these studies did not consider the
social context of sexual content. Research examining the
impact of media sexuality portrayals on youth sexuality out-
comes is shifting from a focus on individual media in isola-
tion to consideration of exposure to multiple media
(Annenberg Media Exposure Research Group, 2008).
Correspondingly, future research documenting shifts in
media content over time would benefit from considering
multiple media in combination.
We coded themes portrayed in popular music by analyz-
ing written transcripts of music lyrics. A more holistic study
of popular music themes would take into account contextual
factors such as artist portrayals, music video features, and
musical properties. As well, our coding of lust and love
themes failed to capture meaningful variation within these
themes. Although lyrics focusing on sex in a casual context
are sometimes coded or interpreted as degrading (e.g., Hall
et al., 2012; Martino et al., 2006), we noticed that most of the
lyrics coded as lust only contained positive and even ideal-
ized images of the person desired. Only a small minority of
these lyrics portrayed unwanted, disrespectful, or humiliat-
ing desire, often communicated through the use of deroga-
tory words such as "ho." Conversely, not all songs with lyrics
of love presented positive portrayals of romantic desire;
rather, a sizable portion of these lyrics portrayed unrequited
love, infidelity, and romantic rejection. Thus, it would be
helpful for future research to consider subthemes of lust and
love. Given that individuals of different ages and back-
grounds may interpret the same lyric in different ways, it
would also be informative to consider how consumers of
these popular songs interpret the lyrics.
Our goal was to examine changes in sexual and romantic
themes in popular music over the past 40 years. We cannot
address the reasons for the observed changes, although the
findings suggest that these changes cannot be explained by
shifts in artist gender or in the popularity of musical genres.
Moreover, we did not address the potential impacts of the
observed changes in the sexual and romantic themes found in
popular music. We expect, however, that popular media such
as music, both reflect changing cultural norms and influence
change in cultural norms. At the individual level, we expect
that there is a reciprocal influence between individuals' sex-
ual attitudes and their exposure to popular music with sexual
content (cf. Bleakley et al., 2008). In addition to further
research examining the potential impacts on individuals who
consume music with particular themes, it would be valuable
for future research to consider how popular music themes
related to sexuality change over time in relation to normative
changes in sexual attitudes and behaviors (cf. DeWall et al.,
2011).
In conclusion, contrary to popular assumptions that popu-
lar music is becoming increasingly sexualized, our findings
indicate that sexual themes in popular music have not
increased systematically over the past 40 years. However,
there has been a significant increase in the proportion of
songs with themes of lust in the absence of love.
Correspondingly, fewer songs portray sexual desire in the
context of romantic feelings. Thus, by considering themes
related to romantic desire as well as themes related to sexual
desire, we were able to provide further insight into the chang-
ing portrayal of sexuality in popular music.

Notes
1. One song was instrumental and could not be coded for themes.
As a result, the sample size was 359 for all findings involving
themes.
2. Percentages sum to greater than 100% because some songs
were characterized by multiple genres.
