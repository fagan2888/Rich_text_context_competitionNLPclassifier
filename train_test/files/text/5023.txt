Introduction
Models of economic growth based on long-term equilibrium,
which assumed the nature of technological progress as Hicks-
neutral cause the following contradiction: For the models of
economic growth based on long-term equilibrium, if Hicks-
neutral technological change is assumed, the economy can
never reach equilibrium; that is, long-term equilibrium can-
not be established. The above contradiction can only be
resolved if either the level of technology is assumed to be
constant over time or the Hicks-neutral assumption of techno-
logical progress is replaced with Harrod-neutral assumption.
Many research articles such as Uzawa (1961), Inada (1964),
Allen (1967), Inada (1969), and Burmeister and Dobell (1970)
have already showed that Harrod-neutral technological prog-
ress is compatible with stability. Acikgoz and Mert (2014) fur-
ther emphasized the importance of this assumption for
time-series econometric analysis. This present study aims to
emphasize that the nature of technological progress should be
assumed rather than Harrod-neutral for mathematical models
of economic growth, which are based on stability.
This study is organized as follows. The section "Main
Problem" discusses the main problem of the study. In the
section "Selected Studies in Literature," we provide some
studies that support our hypothesis. The section "Conclusion"
states the concluding remarks.
Main Problem
The main problem is the assumption of the nature of techno-
logical progress in models of economic growth based on
long-term equilibrium. The nature of the technological prog-
ress is usually assumed as Hicks-neutral or Harrod-neutral.
According to Hicks (1963), Hicks-neutral technological
progress occurs if the capital­labor ratio does not change,
while the ratio of factor prices is constant. According to
Harrod (1948), Harrod-neutral technological progress occurs
if the capital­output ratio does not change, while the mar-
ginal productivity per labor capital stock is constant.
We give an example with regard to Solow (1956).
Solow (1956) gives the following basic equation:

the constant growth rate of labor. At the steady-state conditions,

A Short Note on the Fallacy of
Identification of Technological Progress in
Models of Economic Growth
Senay Acikgoz1 and Merter Mert1
Abstract
This study emphasizes the necessity of the Harrod-neutral identification of technological progress for the models of economic
growth, which use Cobb­Douglas production function and which are based on stability. Some of the important studies, which
reviewed a balanced growth path or a steady state of the Solow model, assumed the nature of technological progress as
Hicks-neutral rather than Harrod-neutral. In this work, we have reminded that Harrod-neutral is a better assumption for the
nature of technological progress in such studies.

Note that the Cobb­Douglas production function with

where  is the elasticity of capital with respect to output.
If the level of technology A is imposed on the production

Equation 7 gives the capital­labor ratio at the steady state,

for the output­labor ratio, when the nature of the technologi-
cal progress is Hicks-neutral.

Proposition 1: If it is assumed that the nature of techno-
logical progress is Hicks-neutral, then the level of tech-
nology should be constant for stability; that is, the level of
technology cannot change over time.
Simple Proof of Proposition 1:Assume that, for all positive
values of A, which are greater than 1, ceteris paribus, the
level of technology rises from A
1
to A
2
. Then, according to

2 for all positive values of
A, which are greater than 1. If the level of technology
rises, for example, 5%, then at the steady state, the
output­labor ratio and the capital­labor ratio should
grow at the same rate. However, since Y t

2, the output­labor ratio grows faster than
the level of technology; that is, steady-state conditions are
not established. Better yet, note that Equation 5 is rewrit-
ten as g g g g g
Y L A K L
- = + -
( )
 , where g is the growth
rate of the relevant variables. It is obvious that if and only
if the growth rate of technology gA
( ) is equal to 0, then
the steady-state conditions are established; that is,
g g g g g
Y L K L A
- = - = = 0.
Indeed, Solow (1956) confirms the proposition stated
above, by extending his model with the neutral technological
change. He uses the following production function:
Y t A t F K L
( ) = ( ) ( )
, , (9)
where technology grows at a constant rate A t egt
( ) =



.
Importantly, Solow (1956) makes a solution for the long run
and shows that the "capital-labor ratio never reach an equi-
librium but grows forever" (p. 85). In other words, if the
level of technology changes over time, then the economy can
never reach the equilibrium.
Selected Studies in the Literature
Some of the selected studies in the literature will be summa-
rized as per our concerns. First, Uzawa (1961) emphasizes
that Solow (1956) and Swan (1956) had been discussed for a
case in which technical inventions are neutral in Hicks's
sense. However, Uzawa (1961) proves the stability of the
growth equilibrium in a neoclassical growth model with neu-
tral inventions in Harrod's sense. Inada (1964) incorporates
neutral technical progress in Harrod's sense into Solow's
model, which assumes no technical progress. Inada (1964)
shows the existence and relative stability of the balanced
growth when there is Harrod-neutral technical progress.
Inada (1969) similarly emphasizes Harrod-neutrality when
defining Arrow type models:
Technical progress is endogenous, embodied and neutral in
Harrod's sense, and is such that labour efficiency is a power
function of cumulative gross investment. We call this the Arrow
type of technical progress. He assumed a fixed coefficient
production function and has shown the existence of a steady
growth path. (p. 99)
Mirrlees (1967) demonstrates "a method of calculating opti-
mum policies for one-good models with Harrod-neutral techno-
logical change" and "prove the conditions for existence of an
optimum policy, and show the general shape of the optimum
development of such an economy" (p. 95). He emphasizes that
"once the assumption of Harrod-neutral technological change is
abandoned, steady growth, in terms of the obvious variables, is
impossible" (p. 118).Akerlof and Nordhaus (1967) assumed that
a model with "a single-good, neo-classical world with capital-
augmenting and Hicks-neutral technological change" (p. 343)
based on Solow (1959). Akerlof and Nordhaus showed that a
Acikgoz and Mert 3
balanced growth with a technological change may be a
razor's edge case. According to them, economists who are
interested in long-run growth models might begin to think in
terms of models showing unbalanced growth with produc-
tion functions that are not the Cobb­Douglass type.
Burmeister and Dobell (1970) clearly show that "unless
technological change is ultimately Harrod-neutral, one-sec-
tor models generally cannot approach an equilibrium bal-
anced growth path that is economically meaningful" (p. 79).
Steedman (1985) presents "a number of significant, alter-
native sufficient conditions under which Hicks neutral tech-
nical change is an impossibility (and is not merely empirically
implausible)" (p. 746). Moreover, Steedman concludes, "It
might not be unreasonable to suggest that those who do
assume it . . . are obliged to show explicitly that assumption
is compatible with their other assumptions" (p. 758).
According to Barro (1990), "The economy is always at a
position of steady-state growth" (p. 106). He uses a production
function specified with Hicks-neutral technological progress but
where technology is constant over time. Thus, Barro (1990) is a
study in which explanations on steady state are compatible with
the nature of technological progress. Finally, also Samuelson
(1965) and Drandakis and Phelps (1966) prove that under some
conditions, the economy will converge to a balanced growth path
in which technical progress is Harrod-neutral.
It is important to explain Romer (1990) and Lucas (1988)
more closely, to clear our argument.
Romer (1990) writes output (Y) using Equation 10:
Y H L x H A LA K
A Y
( , , ) ( ) ( ) ,
= - - + -
     

1 1
(10)
where HA is the marginal product of research sector, x is the
input used by a firm that produces the final output, HY is the
human capital devoted to the final output,  is the unit of
forgone consumption to create one unit of any type of
durable.
Thus, by differentiating,
g g g g
g g
Y H A L
K
Y

( ) + +

( ) + + -
( )
   
    
1 1 . (11)
Note that according to Romer (1990), K Ax
=  . Thus,
g g g g
K A x
= + +
 , so, g g g g
K A x
- - = . Therefore,
Equation 11 is written as
g g g g
g g g g
Y H A L
K K A x
Y
= + +
( ) + +
- -
( ) + + -
( ) - -
( )
   
   
1 1 . (12)
As population and human capital devoted to the final out-
put are constant at Romer (1990) gL = 0 and gHY
= 0, we
can write Equation 13 as
g g g
g g g
Y A K
K A x
= +
( ) + - -
( ) +
+ -
( ) - -
( )

(13)
As along the balanced growth path, x is constant (Romer,
1990), gx
= 0. Besides, along the balanced growth path, the
ratio of K to A should also be constant (Romer, 1990), then
g = 0.
Finally rearranging Equation 13, we can write Equation
14 as follows:
g g
Y A
= . (14)
Since g g g g
K A x
= + +
 , so,
g g
K A
= . (15)
Hence, it is shown that Romer (1990) explains steady
state using an approach based on endogenous technological
progress. Note that Romer (1990) does not assume technol-
ogy as the type of technical change augmenting all factors in
the same way, that is Hicks-neutral.
However, Lucas (1988) is based on a different approach
when explaining neoclassical growth theory. He gives the
following equation:
N t c t K t A t K t N t
( ) ( )+ ( ) = ( ) ( ) ( )
·
-
 
1
, (16)
where N t
( ) is labor, c t
( ) is the per capita consumption, 
is the elasticity of capital with respect to output. Then, it is
obvious that Lucas (1988) assumes Hicks-neutral techno-
logical progress, and moreover, technology grows over time
at a rate that equals µ.
The right side of Equation 16 shows output, Q. Then, per
capita output growth equals

According to Lucas (1988), at a balanced path, per capita
capital and per capita consumption grow at a common rate,
which is equal to Equation 18:
dK
dt K t

Thus, according to Lucas (1988), while per capita capi-
tal and per capita consumption grow at a common rate,
which is equal to µ

Note that Lucas (1988) says that for the off-steady states,
µ

need not to be equal or constant" (p. 15). Hence, according to
him, µ

there is not a steady state due to the fact that the level of tech-
nology is also assumed as a variable (it means that it is the
level of technology over time), and at the balanced path, all the
variables should grow at a common rate. As presented within
Proposition 1 in this present study, if the level of technology
does not change over time and if it is assumed constant, then

so
there will be a steady state or a balanced path.
Recognize that Lucas (1988) assumes the level of tech-
nology constant, while explaining the relation between
human capital and economic growth; that is, the level of
technology does not change over time.
Van Zon and Yetkiner (2003) have a similar approach to
Lucas (1988), although they extended Romer (1990). Van
Zon and Yetkiner extended the Romer (1990) by including
energy consumption of intermediates. They showed that the
resulting model can generate steady-state growth. They
explained how the intermediate sector, by assuming the total-
factor productivity of raw capital and energy, takes the form
of Hicks-neutral technical change. Besides, they assumed that
the level of technology changes over time. Furthermore,
according to Van Zon and Yetkiner (2003), a proportional
instantaneous rate of growth rate of technology can also be
interpreted as "energy augmenting/saving" technical change,
which at rate equals the "growth rate of technology/(1 - elas-
ticity of effective capital with respect to raw capital)" (p. 88).
Recognize that according to Lucas (1988), per capita capital
and per capita consumption grow at a common rate, which is
equal to the "growth rate of technology/(1 - elasticity of out-
put with respect to capital)." Similarly, but apart from Romer
(1990), Benhabib, Perla, and Tonetti (2014) analyze whether
or not emerging economies, which grow faster, can sustain
rapid growth rates. Benhabib et al. (2014) use Hicks-neutral
identification and analyze comparative dynamics for Hicks-
neutral technical change. They show that "Hicks-neutral
increase in the productivity of growth technologies can
change the equilibrium outcome" (p. 20). Whereas, recognize
that if there is Hicks-neutral technological progress, "capital-
labor ratio never reach an equilibrium but grows forever"
(Solow, 1956, p. 85); that is, there will be no equilibrium.
Conclusion
In conclusion, mathematical models of economic growth,
which analyzes balanced growth or steady state and which
uses the Cobb­Douglas production function, should assume
the nature of technological progress as Harrod-neutral.
With this short note, we would like to remind of this postu-
late. However, if Hicks-neutral is assumed rather than
Harrod-neutral, then the level of technology should be
assumed constant for the stability. Furthermore, we suggest
taking into account either Harrod-neutral technological
progress identification or the constant level of technology,
while assuming Hicks-neutral technological progress
identification in the models of economic growth based on
stability.
