Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are important causes of
death, premature death, morbidity, and years of potential
life lost in most developed countries.1 Research has
shown that CVDs are multifactorial disorders that result
from a complex interaction of numerous lifestyle-related
risk factors.2­4 Obesity, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and
high dietary fat intake are all major independent cardio-
vascular (CV) risk factors.2,4,5 Adopting healthy lifestyle

Abstract
Background: Cardiovascular diseases are important causes of death, morbidity, and years of potential life lost in most
developed countries.
Aims: The purpose of this study was to assess trends in knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors among patients five
years after coronary angiography and to investigate the impact of educational level on knowledge level.
Methods: The study included 1289 of 4391 patients admitted for cardiac events in 2008/2009 at the National Institute
for Cardiac Surgery and Interventional Cardiology, Luxembourg. A follow-up study was conducted by post five years
later (2013/2014). Data were obtained from 1837 of the contacted patients (with 548 reported deaths) (response
rate=42%). Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between educational level and knowledge
of cardiovascular risk factors. Educational level was used as a surrogate for socioeconomic status.
Results: In total, 39.9% of patients could list at least three risk factors in 2013/2014, a much higher percentage than
the 8.5% observed during the initial survey. In both sexes, knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors increased between
2008/2009 and 2013/2014. Patients with higher educational levels were more likely (odds ratio=2.33, 95% confidence
interval: 1.63­3.34) to cite at least three risk factors than patients with lower education levels.
Conclusion: Knowledge level was associated with educational level, and improved for all educational groups five
years after coronary angiography. Educational differences in knowledge persisted, but the gaps decreased. Improving
knowledge of cardiovascular risk factors among patients with cardiovascular disease will help increase awareness and
promote lifestyle changes.

behaviours has been shown to reduce CVD risk.2,6 Many
social, cultural, and economic factors contribute to the
development, maintenance, and change of health behav-
iour patterns.7 Knowledge of modifiable risk factors is a
prerequisite for behavioural modification.8 According to
health behaviour models, knowledge of the negative
health consequences of a behaviour is a necessary condi-
tion for behaviour change.2 However, knowledge alone is
not sufficient to promote behavioural change, and aware-
ness of CV risk factors, intention, and self-efficacy are
also essential.3,9,10
Knowledge of CV risk factors is often limited or rela-
tively poor, even in patients with CVD. For example,
less than one-third of patients reported knowledge of all
modifiable risk factors in some studies.8,11 In a recent
study of 260 women following myocardial infarction
(MI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), only a
few identified hypertension (5%), hypercholesterolae-
mia (14%), obesity (15%) and a high-fat diet (16%) as
CV risk factors.12 Wartak et al.13 found that patients'
overall knowledge was good, with 37% of patients able
to identify the effect of all seven factors. Patient knowl-
edge was greatest for harmful factors and lowest for pre-
dictive behaviours.
Knowledge of CV risk factors can vary with the
occurrence of CV events. Recent research has demon-
strated greater knowledge of coronary risk factors
among patients who have experienced MI than among
those who have received a coronary angiography.8
Patients' knowledge and beliefs about CVD are impor-
tant because studies have demonstrated that perceived
personal susceptibility can increase prevention-seeking
behaviours.13,14
According to most studies, the level of knowledge of CV
risk factors is influenced by sociodemographic factors.13,15,16
Multivariate analysis studies have identified education,15
age, marital status, and sex5 as significant sociodemographic
predictors of knowledge of CV risk factors. Using a multi-
variate model, Wartak et al.13 found that knowledge of all
seven components was positively associated with high
school education or greater (odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% con-
fidence interval (CI) 1.68­3.52). Additionally, knowledge
of CV risk factors has been associated with an increase in
health-promoting behaviour.5,8,17 It is known that CV risk
factors and the prevalence of CVD are linked to education
and socioeconomic status.6,8 More recently, it has become
apparent that the risk of heart failure and mortality after MI
is linked to educational level.11,12,15­17 While the underlying
mechanisms are not clear, low educational attainment is also
reported as an indirect cause of CVD through its influence
on lifestyle, unhealthy diets, and beliefs.18­20
The objective of this study was to assess trends in the
knowledge of CV risk factors in patients five years after
coronary angiography, and to evaluate the associations
between awareness of CV risk factors and educational level.
Methods
Design
Data were derived from a follow-up study of 4391 patients
who underwent coronary angiography at the National
Institute for Cardiac Surgery and Interventional Cardiology
(INCCI) in 2008/2009 and participated in the `Social
Determinants and Health Status - ESANDE' research pro-
ject.16 The patient selection procedure of the ESANDE
study involved systematic recruitments to undergo coro-
nary angiography, and the study was prospective in nature.
The patients were contacted again in the context of the
Monitoring and Dynamics of Health Status through the
Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease (MDYNRFC)
project, which aimed to assess the evolution of health sta-
tus and CV risk behaviour. This follow-up study was con-
ducted from July 2013­April 2014.
For the follow-up study, a self-completed questionnaire
was sent by post. In cases in which the patient had died, the
family were asked to mention the date of death on the
questionnaire. In total, 1837 questionnaires were returned
(with 548 notifications of patient death), resulting in a
response rate of 42% of patients who participated in 2008­
2009. Finally, excluding patients who died, information on
1289 patients was used in the longitudinal cohort study.
The questionnaire was composed of two parts: the first
consisted of all questions used at baseline, and the second
included new questions designed to measure health status
dynamics and risk factors for CVD, such as smoking sta-
tus, high blood pressure, hypercholesterolaemia, physical
activity and relative weight, in the context of a longitudi-
nal approach.
Ethical approval and administrative
arrangements
The investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the
Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the National
Research Ethics Committee and the National Commission
for Data Protection. Informed consent was obtained from
all participants. The National Commission for Data
Protection approved the survey design and the content of
the questionnaires. This study is part of the MDYNRFC-
project, and is funded by the National Research Fund.
Measures
Knowledge of CV risk factors was assessed based on
unprompted responses to the survey question: `Can you
cite what are the main cardiovascular risk factors?' This
question was similar to questions used in other studies,
such as: `Can you tell me what are the major causes of
heart disease or heart problems?'.3 In the study by Lynch
et al.,21 participants were asked, `What do you think are the
most important causes of heart attack and stroke?'. Our
138 European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing 17(2)
question focused on the ability to cite five modifiable risk
factors. This formulation of the question allowed us to
understand or appeal to the patient's knowledge with
respect to the probable causes of heart disease. We also
feel that this formulation is more representative because
questions with fixed answers, such as `yes', `no', `true', or
`false', allow people lacking knowledge to guess the cor-
rect answer. This may overestimate patient knowledge.22
The five most cited modifiable CV risk factors identified
by the participants were smoking, diabetes, hypertension,
hypercholesterolaemia and obesity. We supposed that the
ability to cite a CV risk factor was evidence of knowledge
of this CV risk factor.
The CV events considered were angina pectoris (AP),
acute MI and ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Events were
diagnosed by physicians or medical specialists in
2008/2009. The covariates used in the analysis were the
available demographic variables (sex and age group), soci-
oeconomic variables (level of education), and CV risk fac-
tors (smoking status, diabetes status, hypertension status,
cholesterol status and obesity). All variables are defined in
Table 1. Unfortunately, physical activity was rarely indi-
cated by patients, and thus was not included in the five
modifiable risk factors quoted by patients.
Statistical analysis
The descriptive statistical analyses were mainly stratified
according to sex and education level. In the first stage, the
patients' knowledge of several CV risk factors (at least
three), and of each individual CV risk factor was analysed
according to education level and sex. In the second stage,
the patients'knowledge of the same CV risk factor was pre-
sented according to education level and stratified by diagno-
sis. We calculated the rate ratios of knowledge of patients
with the highest educational level compared to patients with
the lowest educational level (rate ratiohighest-lowest
). This indi-
cator allowed us to monitor the gap in knowledge between
groups and over time. Due to the poor knowledge of CV
risk factors among patients in the survey, we considered
the ability to cite at least three CV risk factors as an indica-
tor of knowledge of several CV risk factors. The cut-off of
three CV risk factors as an indicator of knowledge level
was determined in a post-hoc manner.
Logistic regression models were used to assess the
association between educational level and knowledge of
CVD risk factors adjusted by age and sex. The first model
assessed the probability of citing at least three CV risk fac-
tors by educational level, adjusted by age and sex. The
other models, concerning the probability of citing one CV
risk factor, were adjusted by the patients' exposure to the
same CV risk factor to avoid its influence on the analysis.
For example, we assumed that a patient with hypertension
should be able to identify it as a CV risk factor more fre-
quently than a patient without hypertension.
We reduced potential bias by only using the data of
patients who were present in 2008/2009 and 2013/2014.
Comparing participants with non-participants indicated no
major differences.
All data management and statistical analyses were per-
formed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, North
Carolina, USA).
Results
The distribution of sociodemographic characteristics and
risk factors for CVD in the patient population in 2013/2014
is presented in Table 1. In the overall patient population,
70.7% of patients were men, 68.3% were aged 65 years
and older, 10.1% were regular smokers, 29.5% had diabe-
tes, 42.2% had hypertension, 47.2% had high cholesterol
and 31.9% were obese. Women were on average older
(74.0 years) than men (65.8 years). Women most fre-
quently cited CVD risk factors such as hypertension
(49.4%) and high cholesterol (51.1%), while men most
frequently cited regular smoking (11.0%), diabetes
(29.9%) and obesity (32.5%) (Table 1).
The distribution of risk factors for CVD according to
educational level revealed the existence of a social gradi-
ent in the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, high cho-
lesterol and obesity both in the total patient population and
in men and women separately. For example, the preva-
lence of diabetes was 39.9% in men with primary educa-
tion as the highest level of education, 26.9% in the category
`secondary education' and 22.6% in the most highly edu-
cated participants. In women, these figures were 34.1%,
25.9% and 12.5%, respectively (Table 1).
In Table 2, the level of knowledge of risk factors gener-
ally improved in patients five years after coronary angiog-
raphy, but the proportion of patients who cited various
risk factors remained low, except for tobacco smoking.
Among men in 2013/2014, for example, 28.9% of ter-
tiary-educated patients cited diabetes, 39.2% obesity,
40.4% hypertension and 43.4% high cholesterol. Similarly,
among women with tertiary education, 32.0% cited diabe-
tes, 36.0% obesity, 44.0% hypertension and 44.0% high
cholesterol.
The ability to quote at least three risk factors increased
more in women (from 5.6% in 2008/2009 to 38.9% in
2013/2014) than in men (from 9.8% in 2008/2009 to
40.3% in 2013/2014).
The knowledge of each of the major risk factors for
CVD was mainly characterised by the presence of a social
gradient and the reduction of differences in the knowledge
of different risk factors. Patients with tertiary education
cited the various risk factors for CVD more often than
those with only primary or secondary education.
Among men, decreases in these differences were
observed with respect to knowledge of hypertension (7.47
to 1.50), diabetes (3.29 to 1.15), and obesity (4.02 to 1.47).
Tchicaya et al. 139
Among women, the largest decreases in knowledge were
for diabetes (5.52 to 1.36) and obesity (5.00 to 1.36).
In Table 3, patient knowledge of CVD risk factors var-
ied with the diagnosis or occurrence of CV events. Patients
with acute MI were more able to cite at least three CV risk
factors in 2008/2009 (12.3%) and 2014 (45.9%) compared
to patients with angina pectoris (10.8% and 40.4%, respec-
tively) or IHD (7.0% and 37.3%, respectively). In
2013/2014, patients with angina pectoris had a greater ten-
dency to identify tobacco smoking (62.6%) and diabetes
(31.1%) as risk factors, while patients with acute MI iden-
tified hypertension (40.2%), high cholesterol (38.5%) and

obesity (38.5%). The gaps (rate ratio) in knowledge of
CVD risk factors between patients with tertiary vs primary
education decreased, but they were higher in patients with
IHD, diabetes (ratio rate: 1.84), hypertension (ratio rate:
1.79) or tobacco smoking (ratio rate: 1.58) compared to
patients with angina pectoris or acute MI.
In Tables 4 and 5, the models for predicting knowledge
of CV risk factors show that educational level was a strong
predictor of knowledge of CVD risk factors, even in
patients with such risks. The odds to name at least three
risk factors followed a positive gradient with respect to
educational level both in 2008/2009 and 2013/2014 (Table
4). Patients with tertiary or secondary education were 1.9-
times (OR=1.94, 95% CI: 1.49­2.52) or 2.3-times
(OR=2.33, 95% CI: 1.63­3.34) more likely to cite at least
three risk factors than patients who only completed pri-
mary education in 2013/2014. The same values were 1.9-
times (OR=1.87, 95% CI: 1.10­3.20) and 4.1-times
(OR=4.15, 95% CI: 2.29­7.51) in 2008/2009. The associa-
tion between knowledge of risk factors and educational
level, adjusted for age, sex, and risk factors involved, was
significant in 2008 in knowledge of risk factors between
education levels were smaller in 2008/2009 and 2013/2014,
with the exception of diabetes in 2013/2014. Compared to
2008/2009, the differences in knowledge of risk factors
between education levels were smaller in 2013/2014.
Discussion
The results of this study demonstrated persistent socioeco-
nomic difference in knowledge of CV risk factors and poor
knowledge of CV risk factors in patients even five years
after coronary angiography. However, compared to
2008/2009, patients' knowledge of CV risk factors
increased significantly by 2013/2014.
Poor knowledge of CV risk factors and
persistence of socioeconomic differences five
years after coronary angiography
Our findings demonstrated that knowledge of CV risk fac-
tors increased during the five-year follow-up period in the
entire cohort, while differences between the highest edu-
cated patients and the lowest educated patients in both men
and women decreased. The ability to quote at least three
risk factors increased more in women than in men in rela-
tive terms. Poor knowledge of CV risk factors was also
observed in patients undergoing elective CABG, as
reported by Karthik et al.23
Even in population-based studies, knowledge of estab-
lished modifiable CVD risk factors is low, particularly
among the lowest educated groups.21 In Canada, individ-
ual knowledge of risk factors for CVD is poor, and it has
been reported that older Canadians do not possess suffi-
cient knowledge about CVD to improve their health.1
Except for smoking tobacco, which was reliably iden-
tified as a CV risk factor, <40% of the patients reported
knowledge of diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol,
and obesity in 2013/2014. Similarly, <10% of patients
(both men and women) were able to cite at least five mod-
ifiable CV risk factors (figures not shown). However,
other studies have reported significant differences in the
knowledge of CV risk factors between men and
women.3,8,24 For example, some studies have shown that
knowledge of coronary risk factors remains relatively
poor in women.8,12,25 In a recent study of 260 women fol-
lowing MI or CABG, women mainly attributed their coro-
nary heart disease to smoking (44%) and family history
(40%),12 while only a few women identified hypertension
(5%), hypercholesterolaemia (14%), obesity (15%) and a
high-fat diet (16%) as risk factors.12 In contrast, our find-
ings showed that men tended to possess better knowledge
of the various CV risk factors than women, but this was
not statistically significant.
In the present study, socioeconomic differences in the
knowledge of risk factors among patients were still present
five years after the initial assessment, although they all
decreased significantly with the exception of hypertension
in women. These results are useful, and will help in the
development of specific and targeted intervention pro-
grammes within the context of secondary prevention.
Knowledge of CV risk factors was influenced by
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics
and experience with different CV risk factors
In this study, younger patients had better knowledge or
awareness of CV risk factors than elderly patients in both
2008/2009 and 2013/2014. An interesting result was the
lack of a significant difference between women and men
both at 2008/2009 and 2013/2014. Surprisingly, our find-
ings demonstrated a decrease in the knowledge gap
between patients who had or had not experienced CV risk
factors in 2013/2014 compared to 2008/2009. Importantly,
our results confirmed that educational level was a strong
predictor of the knowledge of risk factors for CVD, even
in patients with such risks factors. Moreover, educational
level was not associated with knowledge of diabetes as a
CV risk factor in 2013/2014. Several studies found that
socioeconomic status, and particularly education, was a
strong and consistent predictor of risk factor aware-
ness.13,16,24,26,27 Indeed, educational level reflects living
conditions during the early part of a person's life, and is
associated with knowledge of CVD risk factors.24 A study
reported by Kayaniyil et al.27 found that cardiac inpatients
with lower than high school education had significantly
worse knowledge of coronary heart disease risk factors.
Psychosocial parameters may also play a role; patients
with higher education levels are more motivated to seek
information regarding healthy lifestyle habits,26 and

generally have better perception of severity, benefits and
self-efficacy.28
The inverse relationship between the prevalence of
risk factors and educational level often implies a positive
relationship between the awareness of risk factors and
educational level.16 As a consequence, the knowledge
and awareness of modifiable CV risk factors may be
associated with healthier behaviours regarding those risk
factors.28 However, Alzaman et al.28 found that `the rela-
tion between awareness of the influence of a specific fac-
tor on CVD and healthy behaviour regarding that risk
factor effect were modest, with a <10% difference
between those who were aware vs. those who were una-
ware' (609). Knowledge of CV risk factors exists within
a system of beliefs (incorporating psychosocial and bio-
medical issues), not in isolation.21,29 Furthermore, few
reports have suggested that educational attainment is an
indirect cause of coronary heart disease.20 Conversely,
one study showed that education level is not predictive of
knowledge of CVD.2
Implications of results from a secondary
prevention perspective
In the context of secondary prevention, it should be
expected that differences in the knowledge and aware-
ness of CV risk factors would be reduced or disappear
completely over time. Indeed, any patient, regardless of
socioeconomic status, can become aware of the differ-
ent risks and ways to combat them because care after a
cardiac event aims to restore quality of life and main-
tain or improve functional capacity.30,31 Most CVD
patients benefit from a cardiac rehabilitation pro-
gramme in the secondary prevention framework after a
cardiac event.
The results of the present study demonstrated both
improved knowledge and a reduction in differences associ-
ated with knowledge among patients five years after coro-
nary angiography. These changes probably represent the
consequences of various interventions during the five-year
follow-up period. However, our findings also demon-
strated poor knowledge of CV risk factors that persisted
among patients despite the fact that the risk factors were
prevalent in the patient group. This information should
raise concerns, and needs to be addressed in order to
improve outcomes in patients with CVD.16
The results of this study highlighted the fact that
improvements in patient knowledge of CV risk factors
occur slowly. Knowledge and/or awareness of CV risk fac-
tors is often not sufficient to bring about change. For
example, the transtheoretical model is a heuristic model
that describes the sequence of steps in successful behav-
ioural change: (a) precontemplation (no recognition of
need for or interest in change); (b) contemplation (thinking
about changing); (c) preparation (planning for change); (d)
action (adopting new habits); and (e) maintenance (on-
going practice of new, healthier behaviour).7,32
The presence of a high global CV risk in patients with
lower levels of education might be attributed to poor com-
munication between doctor and patient and/or an insuffi-
cient understanding by the patient of the importance of the
proper management of CV risk factors.33,34 This is another
reason why the results of this study may prove important
in the development of effective educational and secondary
prevention strategies. In the future, it will be important to
collect long-term data on the knowledge and awareness of
risk factors within different social groups after coronary
angiography. This will allow prevention programmes to be
specifically targeted to help poorly educated or lower soci-
oeconomic patients.26
Limitations and strengths
The results of this study are not representative of all patients
with CVD in Luxembourg.16,35 However, the INCCI is a
reference national service for coronary angiography in
Luxembourg. As our study was based on a relatively long-
term follow-up (five years), a substantial number of patients
died or did not live at their reported address at the end of
this period. This could have affected the composition of our
cohort, leading to bias. To avoid such bias, we concentrated
our analysis on patients who were present in 2008/2009 and
2013/2014. The INCCI database is unique, combining
information regarding diagnosis, CV risk factors, quality of
life, lifestyle changes and health status. Much of the data
are self-reported or measured by physicians or medical spe-
cialists (specifically in 2008/2009). In a past study,16 we
observed that patient knowledge of CV risk factors was
very poor in all socioeconomic groups, and was particu-
larly modified by education level. Education level was used
as a proxy for socioeconomic status based on previous
reports.35,36 However, as mentioned previously, knowledge
alone is only a pre-requisite for behavioural changes.2,24
Consequently, future research should examine the relation-
ship between knowledge, risk perception, self-efficacy and
behaviour change.2 The use of a non-validated question-
naire to assess knowledge was also a limitation, and future
studies may benefit from the development of a validated
questionnaire.27
Implications for practice
·
· Many patients were unable to recall cardiovascu-
lar (CV) risk factors
·
· Knowledge improved in all social groups
·
· Knowledge was lower in patients with a lower
education
·
· Counselling and preventive interventions are
needed
