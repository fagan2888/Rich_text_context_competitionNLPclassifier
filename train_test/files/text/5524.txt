Introduction
In their influential article entitled "Testing Theories of
American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average
Citizens," Martin Gilens and Benjamin I. Page use statistical
analysis to adjudicate between four ideal-type theories of
American politics (Gilens and Page, 2014). Their main find-
ings are that "economic elites and organized groups repre-
senting business interests have substantial independent
impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens
and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent
influence." These findings provide support for theories
called economic-elite domination and biased pluralism.
According to several journalistic accounts but not
Gilens and Page themselves, the findings show that the
American system of government is best understood as
"oligarchy."1 Extensive press coverage of the article has
successfully drawn attention to one of the most important
questions in the study of contemporary American poli-
tics: to what extent do the wealthy dominate average citi-
zens in the formulation of government policy?2 In pursuit
of an answer, Gilens and his team of researchers gathered
data over a long period, tracking 1923 instances between
1981 and 2002 in which national surveys asked favor/
oppose questions about proposed policy changes. This is
a commendable attempt to bring evidence to the study of
a timely and politically-loaded topic. Yet, as Gilens notes
in his 2012 book based on a similar empirical foundation,
even the most meticulously assembled dataset may not
lend itself to straightforward inference.
Gilens and Page nevertheless draw several strong infer-
ences from their analysis. The authors do not argue that
policy outcomes correspond disproportionately to the pref-
erences of the wealthy; in fact, their dataset reveals that the
wealthy and the average have highly correlated prefer-
ences. Rather, the main inferences in the paper are about
causality: do we only have "democracy by coincidence" in
the United States? Gilens and Page claim that they can
"decisively reject" majoritarian views of American democ-
racy because they have found a way to determine which
groups have "independent influence" in policymaking.3
According to the authors, "[o]ur main point concerns causal
inference: if interpreted in terms of actual causal impact,

American Politics: A Review of
the "Oligarchy" Result

Abstract
In a well-publicized study, Gilens and Page argue that economic elites and business interest groups exert strong influence
on US government policy while average citizens have virtually no influence at all. Their conclusions are drawn from a
model which is said to reveal the causal impact of each group's preferences. It is shown here that the test on which the
original study is based is prone to underestimating the impact of citizens at the 50th income percentile by a wide margin.
In addition, descriptive analysis of the authors' dataset reveals that average Americans have received their preferred
policy outcome roughly as often as elites have when the two groups have disagreed with each other. Evidence that
average citizens are effectively ignored by the policy process may not be as strong as is suggested by the authors.

the prior findings [supporting majoritarian theories] appear
to be largely or wholly spurious."4 They point to a "nearly
total failure" of majoritarian frames and assert that "the
preferences of economic elites... have far more independ-
ent impact upon policy change than the preferences of aver-
age citizens do."5 They conclude that "America's claims to
being a democratic society are seriously threatened."6
After summarizing the steps taken by Gilens and Page, I
examine the statistical basis for their central claim that
average Americans have virtually no influence on policy
outcomes. I show that the result on which the original study
is based is too likely to have been produced by chance
because the income-based independent variables are highly
correlated. I then evaluate three of the study's descriptive
claims about American democracy before concluding.
Summary of original approach
This section outlines the steps taken to reproduce Table 3 in
the original paper. Reprinted here as Table 1, it features the
main result of the study. Several predicted probability plots
and odds comparisons in the original article are based on the
coefficients in Model 4 of the table. Gilens and Page show
in the first three columns that each of their independent vari-
ables, one at a time, seem to exert a positive and significant
effect on policy outcomes.7 These independent variables
include the preferences of average citizens (proxied by the
estimated preferences of respondents at the 50th income
percentile), the preferences of economic elites (90th income
percentile), and the preferences of interest groups.
"But the picture changes markedly," the authors state,
"when all three independent variables are included in the
multivariate Model 4... The estimated impact of average
citizens' preferences drops precipitously, to a non-signifi-
cant, near-zero level. Clearly the median citizen or `median
voter' at the heart of theories of Majoritarian Electoral
Democracy does not do well when put up against economic
elites and organized interest groups."8 Note that the authors'
basis for causal inference is the inclusion of multiple vari-
ables in the same model.
Model 4, the key result in the paper, does not reflect the
output of a typical logistic or linear regression test. The
authors pursue a rather non-standard approach because they
identify correlated survey error between the 50th and 90th
income percentile preference variables. As they explain in
their Appendix 2, a typical multiple regression9 including
both those variables produces implausible coefficient esti-
mates. These implausible estimates are attributed to the
correlated survey error just mentioned.10
Given their diagnosis, Gilens and Page perform a multi-
step correction procedure. First, they quantify correlated
survey error by exploiting groups of two, three, or more of
the 1779 survey questions which they code as addressing
the same basic concept in the same calendar year. The
authors claim that, based on their identification of 116 sets
of similar survey questions, measurement error is responsi-
ble for 17% of the observed covariance between the meas-
ured 90th and 50th percentile variables.11
Next, using that estimate of correlated measurement
error, the authors "estimated structural equation models in
AMOS that purged of error the structural coefficients rep-
resenting the associations of the predictors with [their] out-
come measure." The structural equations are not specified
in the paper. AMOS features a graphical interface in which
users draw model diagrams. Unfortunately, the input dia-
gram for the central statistical test is not included in the
paper's replication repository,12 but one of the authors
kindly shared it with me. The input diagram consists of two
linked components as in Arbuckle (2012).13 One is a meas-
urement submodel which accounts for the aforementioned
correlated error between the income-based variables and
also for measurement error in the interest-group variable
alone (the authors estimate a reliability of 0.87 for that
measure). Second, the core submodel linking the unob-
served but "corrected" versions of independent variables to
the dichotomous dependent variable is a linear regression
model for which AMOS provides coefficients. These coef-
ficients are those reported in Model 4.
For presentational purposes, the authors use the coeffi-
cients to compute predicted probabilities of policy change.
The plots in the study reveal a flat line of virtually zero
policy responsiveness to the preferences of average
Americans. Meanwhile, elites' preferences seem to swing
the predicted probabilities of policy change dramatically. I
was unsure about how to repeat the process of computing
those probabilities since Model 4 is a modified linear
Table 1. Reprinted from Table 3 in Gilens and Page. From the original caption: the dependent variable is the policy outcome,
coded 1 if the proposed policy change took place within 4 years of the survey date and 0 if it did not. Predictors are the logits of
the imputed percentage of respondents at the 50th ("average citizens") or 90th ("economic elites") income percentile that favor the
proposed policy change... All analyses reflect estimated measurement error in the predictors.

regression, not a logistic regression. But because the pre-
dicted probability plots are all based on the coefficients
reported in Model 4, any problems with the divergent coef-
ficients representing the median- and high-income groups
would implicate the plots as well. The next section thus
asks whether there is an alternative explanation for the dif-
ference in reported coefficients.
Deceptively divergent income
coefficients
Recall from Table 1, Model 4 above the striking differ-
ence reported between income-based coefficients. The
coefficient for 90th income percentile Americans is highly
significant (p < 0.001). At a value of 0.76, it is over 25
times larger than the coefficient of 0.03 corresponding to
the median-income group. Because the 50th percentile
coefficient takes on a "near zero" value, the authors claim
that the policy process is non-responsive to average
Americans.
But the original study relies on linear regression of a
dichotomous dependent variable on two highly correlated
independent variables. Standard practice when dealing with
dichotomous outcomes is to employ logistic regression to
avoid violation of the constant error variance assumption of
linear regression. In addition, high correlation between inde-
pendent variables violates an assumption of both linear and
logistic regression. The correlation coefficient between the
income-based variables is r = 0.78, even after the authors'
procedure to address correlated error reduces the coefficient
from its observed value of r = 0.94. Another reason to
investigate further is that the preference distributions of the
two income groups are difficult to distinguish from each
other when conditioned on policy outcome, as shown in
Figure 1. The high correlation between variables already
suggests that the unconditioned distributions are similar to
each other. Yet if one group is far more influential on policy,
one might expect distributions to diverge when conditioning
in this way. Group means are within 0.02 of each other in
both plots.
I employ a simulation to investigate whether the authors'
linear regression of a dichotomous dependent variable on
highly correlated independent variables can generate
extreme but incorrect results. Online Appendix A lists the
specific steps in the simulation, which is implemented in R
with replication code accompanying this review.14
While the steps are detailed elsewhere, here I provide an
overview of the procedure. For each simulation iteration, I
randomly generate three independent variables, ensuring
that they each have the properties and mutual relationships
that the Gilens and Page variables have after the authors'
error corrections are applied. This means, for instance,
ensuring that two of the randomly generated variables are
highly correlated (r = 0.78). Next, I construct an outcome
variable for the iteration by first choosing a "true" coeffi-
cient for each independent variable and then using a linear
model to compute the left-hand side in the familiar regres-
sion equation setup based on those coefficients. The out-
come variable is dichotomized to match the form of its
analogue in the study. Finally, I perform linear regression of
the outcome variable back on the randomly generated inde-
pendent variables, which should yield estimated coeffi-
cients close to the three true coefficients that defined the
data-generating process. If linear regression fails to pro-
duce accurate estimates of the true coefficients, this signals
a problem with the numerical conditions in the study.
Specifically, if I choose a true coefficient for the analogue
to the median-income independent variable that is reason-
ably large, but the approach tends to produce a much
smaller and thus erroneous estimate along with high levels

4 Research and Politics 
of apparent statistical significance, then the Gilens and
Page result may not be reliable.
Another way to describe the simulation is that it com-
putes regression coefficient estimates under a fixed set of
true (chosen) coefficients. It allows one to ask, "If the true
coefficients for the 50th and 90th percentile variables were
in fact 
1
t and 
2
t , what kinds of estimates of those coef-
ficients, 
1
and 
2
, would the study's approach tend to
produce?" The chosen coefficients 
1
t and 
2
t are true in
the sense that they are used in each simulation iteration to
construct an outcome variable from randomly-generated
versions of the independent variables, matching as closely
as possible the conditions in the original study. One would
expect the estimated coefficients produced by subsequent
regression to be close to the true coefficients chosen to seed
each iteration.
Note that I am not simply questioning the statistical sig-
nificance of the difference between the 50th and 90th percen-
tile coefficients, which would require only a test of the null
hypothesis of coefficient equality. In other words, Gilens and
Page do not merely argue that the income-based coefficients
are statistically different from each other; indeed, prior
research already holds that the wealthy have a moderately
greater impact on policy outcomes. The authors go further by
stressing a drastic substantive difference in coefficient mag-
nitude, with one coefficient being virtually zero.
Results
What if the 50th percentile coefficient were in reality not
minuscule? Would the study's approach report that it was
near zero nonetheless? I run multiple simulations to answer
the question. Across simulations, I vary the true coefficient

1
t corresponding to the median-income variable at values
much larger than its reported value of 0.03. This allows one
to examine the rate of erroneously small estimates as a
function of the values that 
1
might actually take. I hold
the true coefficient 
2
t corresponding to elites at its reported
value of 0.76 in every simulation.
The results are displayed in Figure 2. If 
1
t is about 0.4,
larger than half of the high-income coefficient, the statisti-
cal approach in the study mistakenly estimates it to be
essentially zero in more than 20 percent of trials.15 We also
see the study's extreme divergence between 
1
and 
2
at
a rate greater than 10 percent when the chosen coefficient is
set to that value.
Not shown in the figure is that when the enforced cor-
relation between independent variables is reduced from
0.78 (as in the study) to lower values, the simulation does
not produce extreme results by either criterion, 
1
near
zero or wide divergence between 
1
and 
2
, for any value
of 
1
t tested. That reliable results are produced when this
change is made confirms that the simulation is not stacked
against the original approach.
When we return to the study's correlation level (Figure 2)
and instead set 
1
t
to 0.56, equal to the coefficient reported
for interest groups, the estimated coefficient is still
found to be essentially zero in more than ten percent of simu-
lation trials even though it is known to be much larger. The
extreme divergence found in the study is also still produced
at a rate that exceeds the common 95% significance standard.
Even if the median-income and interest group coefficients
were in fact equal to each other, the authors' approach would
too often produce the numbers they report simply by chance.
The main point is not a single significance test, but
rather that Figure 2 illustrates how multivariate regression
under these conditions is indeed prone to overstatement of
the importance of income. Furthermore, it makes sense that

1

t (not shown) is more likely than any of the larger
chosen coefficients tested in the figure to yield the wide
coefficient divergence (0.03,0.76) reported in the study.
But it yields that divergence and corresponding statistical
significance at a rate of only 0.3. Thus, a 50th percentile
coefficient of 
1
= 0.41 is roughly 40% as likely as the
reported value of 
1
= 0.03 to have produced the main
result on which the study is based.

t, is very low for those simulations in which
the two independent variables of interest are as highly cor-
related as those in the study. When the enforced correlation
coefficient between the first two independent variables is
reduced from 0.78 to lower positive values, the performance
of multivariate analysis improves. Thus, even though stand-
ard errors are reported to be small, the high correlation
between the preferences of median-income and high-income
Americans seems to interfere with reliable estimation.
Online Appendix B gauges whether a simpler kind of
test can support the assertion that average Americans have
no impact on policy. Conditional on interest group opposi-
tion to change, the policy process seems more responsive to
median-income citizens than to economic elites. On the
other hand, the preferences of the wealthy seem to have
much more impact when interest groups support change,
though the number of cases involved in the analysis is
small.16 Future research might investigate this divergence
further. The possibility that differences in income-based
responsiveness are conditional is another potential caveat
to the study's findings.17
Distinguishing and evaluating other
claims
The previous section shows that there is not yet enough evi-
dence for the claim that average citizens have very little
impact on policy outcomes. Yet there are three descriptive
claims in the original paper which should be examined as
well. These assertions, some of which have been empha-
sized in popular discourse, are more distinct from the central
claim and from each other than they at first appear to be.
First, the authors state that "even when fairly large
majorities of Americans favor policy change, they gener-
ally do not get it."18 Gilens and Page reference in their con-
clusion their descriptive finding that, even if 80% of the
public favors change, that change occurs less than half of
the time.19 Readers of the concluding section may not real-
ize that "public" includes elites. In the original dataset,
change is enacted 47% of the time that median-income
Americans favor it at a rate of 80% or more. Yet change is
enacted 52% of the time that elites favor it at that rate. The
difference between groups is smaller when one examines
not only strong preferences for change but strong prefer-
ences for either policy outcome.20 The authors mention but
do not emphasize that elites, too, seem to be affected by a
status-quo bias. It is not clear how this finding is consistent
with a story of elite domination, especially because average
citizens tend to support the status quo more often when the
groups disagree.
Second, Gilens and Page claim that "reality is best cap-
tured by" theories in which both economic elites and organ-
ized interest groups "play a substantial part in affecting
public policy..."21 Shortly after claiming that their model
captures reality, the authors caution that the R2 value for
Model 4 is 0.074. Roughly speaking, that means that their
model, which accounts for the very groups that they say
play a substantial, even dominant22 role in determining
policy, explains less than 10 percent of the observed varia-
tion in policy outcomes. The drastically different coeffi-
cients (0.03 and 0.76) reported for the two income groups
can be exchanged with each other and the resulting model
still successfully predicts almost the same number of policy
changes in the sample.23
The authors acknowledge the low R2 value and list
potential reasons.24 The low value is not necessarily a prob-
lem for hypothesis testing. Still, it provides useful informa-
tion. For instance, when neither the rich nor the average
favor change, change still happens at a rate of 23% in the
dataset. The policy process seems only weakly responsive
to the preferences of the wealthy compared to variables
missing from the model.
Finally, Gilens and Page claim that ordinary citizens get
the policies they favor "only because those policies happen
also to be preferred by the economically-elite citizens who
wield the actual influence."25 The authors' main focus is on
causality, but they also make the descriptive claim that
when average citizens disagree with elites or organized
interests, "they generally lose."26 To commentators, this
interpretation seemed to capture the essence of the project.
One prominent voice summarized the entire study in the
following way: "when elite preferences and popular prefer-
ences are different, the elite almost always wins."27
Figure 3. When independent variables are as highly correlated
as they are in the study (solid curve), the 95% confidence
interval frequently misses the true coefficient value (low
coverage ratio). Performance of the study's approach improves
at lower levels of correlation.
6 Research and Politics 
Yet, this is contradicted by the authors' dataset. There are
185 cases in the data in which the average preferences of
the two income groups are on opposite sides of an issue.28
Median-income Americans receive their desired outcome
47% of the time that the policy process must pick a winner
between the average and the elite since the two groups disa-
gree. The results are similar when the analysis is restricted to
only those cases of disagreement which also exhibit a large
preference gap between groups.29 Nor do the results change
if interest groups are incorporated as follows. The rich get
their favored outcome despite the combined opposition of
the other two groups at a rate of 32%; meanwhile, average
Americans' favored outcome occurs 30% of the time that
they face combined opposition from interest groups and the
wealthy. It is true that median-income citizens are more
likely to prefer the status quo when they and the wealthy
disagree, but this suggests that any status-quo bias embedded
in the policy process favors average Americans.
Conclusion
Even if I have not erred in this review, it would be wrong for
readers to conclude that the wealthiest Americans and busi-
ness interests do not enjoy advantages in influencing the
policy process. The Gilens and Page (2014) article is only
one part of a growing body of scholarship on this topic,30 and
further work may uncover evidence that these advantages are
in fact overwhelming. In addition, even if inequality were
somehow shown to have no bearing on who influences pol-
icy, it would still be morally wrong to ignore it.
Yet, what this review aims to highlight is that the original
study exhibits weaknesses in its main causal claim and
in three of its descriptive claims. The statistical approach
employed in the study's central test seems too unreliable to
gauge how much influence median-income citizens enjoy
relative to elites and interest groups. The combination of a
linear model, dichotomous dependent variable, and high cor-
relation between independent variables yields misleading
estimates. The coefficient representing the influence of
median-income citizens could be as large as the coefficient
for interest group influence. The more important issue is that
the study's approach has poor resolution on the median-
income coefficient. The approach also often produces confi-
dence intervals which do not contain true coefficient values.
In short, the analysis is prone to underestimating dras-
tically the causal impact of median-income preferences,
assuming that regression coefficients even capture causality
in this context: the authors' claim to causal inference is
based only on the fact that they perform multiple regression.
The authors have not yet shown that prior findings more
amenable to majoritarian theories are "largely or wholly
spurious," nor do their results seem to enable adjudication
between competing conceptions of American democracy.
I also evaluated a set of secondary claims in the study.
The notion that the American system is mere "democracy
by coincidence" must contend with the finding that average
Americans have received their desired outcome roughly as
often as the richest have when the two groups have been on
opposite sides of an issue. Any status-quo bias in the policy
process affects both income groups to a similar extent, and
it may favor average citizens, who prefer the status quo
more often in the data. In addition, the authors' model
explains little of the variation in policy outcomes, so eco-
nomic elites and interest groups cannot be said to "domi-
nate" policymaking on the basis of this research even if
they do have a greater impact than average citizens.
Although the authors' potentially fruitful distinction
between different types of interest groups was not the focus
of this review, the original study's result regarding the
advantage of business groups over mass-based groups is
unclear. Gilens and Page emphasize a much larger regres-
sion coefficient for business groups than for mass-based
groups in their Table 4. Yet they then report that, after they
adjust for the number of actors of each kind, the two inter-
est group types have roughly equal influence. The predomi-
nance of business interest groups in the study thus rests on
the fact that there are more of them included in the analysis,
which is partly a result of the authors' choice to add busi-
ness groups they felt were missing from Fortune maga-
zine's"Power25"lists.31 Itisnotclear,then,thatmass-based
groups (labor organizations but also, by the authors' defini-
tion, the National Rifle Association, Christian Coalition,
American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and National
Right to Life Committee) have little influence. We also
know from Gilens's (2012) book that mass-based groups
have been largely responsible for the fact that social wel-
fare policy seems to reflect the preferences of low- and
median-income citizens more strongly than does govern-
ment policy in other areas.32
The tests in that book may provide a better way forward
on the question of influence. For instance, some analyses in
the book examine not "disagreement" between groups but
rather issues on which different income groups diverge in
their imputed preference level by more than 10%. I only
caution that divergence does not imply low correlation. In
addition, frequent overlap between survey questions in the
dataset may be a problem for large- N analysis. Some issues
each generate several similar observations because there are
multiple surveys about them. Repeated observations include
but are not limited to at least nine questions about NAFTA
which all appear as separate victories for the wealthy despite
being based on the same policy outcome.33 For further illus-
tration, I provide code that simplifies the presentation of
observations for which elites and median-income citizens
diverge by 10 points or more.34 It seems difficult to make
normative judgments about the policy process without
paying attention to which policies median-income citizens
supported or opposed more strongly than elites during the
time period in the study.
In closing, "Testing Theories of American Politics" is
best where it emphasizes the tentative and imperfect nature
of its analysis and where it motivates others to explore
Bashir 7
further the question of who really governs. I am grateful for
the clarifications that one of the authors was willing to pro-
vide. Yet, given existing evidence, average Americans
should not believe that it is hopeless to confront or redress
through political participation those unfair advantages that
elites and organized groups surely do enjoy.

23. This is assuming for simplicity that 0.03 and 0.76 represent
regression coefficients in a linear model which does not
account for measurement error; the primary analysis above
was careful to account for that error.

preference gap that Gilens considers to be large in his 2012 book.

33. Some overlap is less direct: median-income citizens often
oppose any form of foreign assistance much more than elites, but
aid happens to be a valuable tool of foreign policy (and a much
smaller proportion of the federal budget than most Americans
believe) so it is used often; many observations in the data involve
questions of foreign assistance. In each of the four main policy
areas in the study, there are themes which recur across observa-
tions.Anumber of entries in the religious/moral policy category,
for instance, involve similar questions about reproductive rights
for which outcomes are not independent.
