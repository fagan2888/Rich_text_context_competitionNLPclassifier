OBJECTIVE -- We examined the prevalences of diagnosed diabetes, and undiagnosed dia-
betes and pre-diabetes using fasting and 2-h oral glucose tolerance test values, in the U.S. during
2005­2006. We then compared the prevalences of these conditions with those in 1988­1994.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- In 2005­2006, the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey included a probability sample of 7,267 people aged 12 years.
Participants were classified according to glycemic status by interview for diagnosed diabetes and
by fasting and 2-h glucoses measured in subsamples.
RESULTS -- In 2005­2006, the crude prevalence of total diabetes in people aged 20 years
was 12.9%, of which 40% was undiagnosed. In people aged 20 years, the crude prevalence
of impaired fasting glucose was 25.7% and of impaired glucose tolerance was 13.8%, with almost
30% having either. Over 40% of individuals had diabetes or pre-diabetes. Almost one-third of
the elderly had diabetes, and three-quarters had diabetes or pre-diabetes. Compared with non-
Hispanic whites, age- and sex-standardized prevalence of diagnosed diabetes was approximately
twice as high in non-Hispanic blacks (P  0.0001) and Mexican Americans (P  0.0001),
whereas undiagnosed diabetes was not higher. Crude prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in people
aged 20 years rose from 5.1% in 1988­1994 to 7.7% in 2005­2006 (P  0.0001); this was
significant after accounting for differences in age and sex, particularly in non-Hispanic blacks.
Prevalences of undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes were generally stable, although the pro-
portion of total diabetes that was undiagnosed decreased in Mexican Americans.
CONCLUSIONS -- Over 40% of people aged 20 years have hyperglycemic conditions,
and prevalence is higher in minorities. Diagnosed diabetes has increased over time, but other
conditions have been relatively stable.
Diabetes Care 32:287­294, 2009
Diabetes and its complications re-
main major causes of morbidity and
mortality in the U.S. (1). Estimated
economic costs of diabetes in medical ex-
penditures and lost productivity total
$174 billion in the U.S. in 2007 (2). In
1999­2002, the crude prevalence of dia-
betes (diagnosed and undiagnosed) in the
U.S. was 9.3%, of which 30% was undi-
agnosed based on fasting plasma glucose
(FPG) (3). A further 26% had impaired
fasting glucose (IFG). IFG increases the
risk of diabetes (4), and both undiag-
nosed diabetes and IFG are associated
with diabetes complications and risk fac-
tors (4,5). These prevalence data came
from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES), the only
national survey that captures information
on diabetes and pre-diabetes from an in-
terview and FPG.
In 2005­2006, an oral glucose toler-
ance test (OGTT) was added to NHANES,
which had not been performed since
NHANES 1988­1994. Whereas elevated
FPG is determined more by impaired he-
patic insulin resistance, elevated 2-h
plasma glucose from an OGTT is deter-
mined predominantly by peripheral insu-
lin resistance (4,6). The OGTT aids in
detecting the total burden of diabetes and
also impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).
Two-hour plasma glucose values are
more sensitive in the elderly (7), an in-
creasing proportion of the U.S. popula-
tion. IGT also predicts diabetes and is
more commonly associated with cardio-
vascular disease risk factors and events
than IFG (4,8).
In this report, we analyze the preva-
lence of diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed
diabetes based on fasting and 2-h plasma
glucose from an OGTT, and pre-diabetes
(IFG or IGT) in people aged 12 years
using data from NHANES 2005­2006.
Results are presented by age, sex, and
race/ethnicity. We compare these esti-
mates with those from NHANES 1988­
1994.
The addition of the OGTT also al-
lowed assessment of the agreement
between diagnostic categories defined by
fasting and 2-h plasma glucose. Although
this was examined in NHANES 1988­
1994 in those aged 40­74 years (9), a
reexamination is appropriate given 1) the
measurements in a wider age range in
NHANES 2005­2006, 2) the change in
criteria for IFG (lowered from 110 to 100
mg/dl) since that report (8), and 3) the
rising prevalence of glucose abnormalities
(3) and obesity (10).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- NHANES 2005­2006
was conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics (11). NHANES is de-
signed to be representative of the U.S. ci-
vilian noninstitutionalized population
using a complex, multistage probability
sample. Participants are interviewed in
their homes and subsequently receive a
physical and laboratory examination in a
mobile examination center. Among eligi-
ble subjects in 2005­2006, 77.7% were
interviewed and 74.9% were examined
(11).
In 2005­2006, 7,267 individuals aged
12 years completed the household inter-
view (online appendix Figure A1 [available
at http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-1296]).
Questions covered demographic character-
istics and medical conditions. Individuals
were asked whether, other than during
pregnancy for women, a doctor or health
care professional had ever told them that
they have diabetes. There were 516 individ-
uals aged 12 years classified as having
diagnosed diabetes.
Households were randomized to ei-
ther a morning or afternoon/evening ex-
amination session. There were 3,107
individuals aged 12 years without diag-
nosed diabetes examined during a morn-
ing session, and plasma glucose values
were obtained from 2,662 (86%) of them
after they fasted for 8 to 24 h. This
group is subsequently referred to as the
FPG subsample. Pregnant women (n 
162) were included, none of whom had
undiagnosed diabetes based on FPG.
Individuals assigned to the morning
examination underwent an OGTT (11). A
75-g glucose-equivalent oral glucose
challenge (Trutol) was given, and a blood
sample was drawn 2 h (15 min) later.
Exclusion criteria included use of insulin
or oral medications for diabetes, known
pregnancy, hemophilia, chemotherapy,
refusal of phlebotomy, and inability/
refusal to drink all of the Trutol. The 2-h
glucose value was obtained for 2,290
(86%) of those in the FPG sample. This
group is subsequently referred to as the
OGTT subsample.
Procedures for blood collection and
processing are described elsewhere (11).
Plasma glucose was measured at a central
laboratory using a hexokinase enzymatic
method (11), with a coefficient of varia-
tion of 1.3­2.2% (11). A1C was measured
by a high-performance liquid chromato-
graphic assay (11). Because there were
changes to the equipment and laboratory
that measured glucose and A1C since the
earlier NHANES surveys, conversion fac-
tors were applied to values from 2005­
2006 to make them comparable with
values from NHANES III (1988­1994)
(11).
Standard diagnostic criteria were
used to classify people without diagnosed
diabetes as to whether they had undiag-
nosed diabetes (FPG 7.0 mmol/l and/or
2-h glucose 11.1 mmol/l) or pre-
diabetes (IFG [FPG 5.6 to 7.0 mmol/l]
and/or IGT [2-h glucose 7.8 to 11.1
mmol/l]) (12).
Estimates from NHANES 2005­2006
are compared with those from NHANES
1988­1994. NHANES 1988­1994 used
similar interview questions on previous
diagnosis of diabetes (13,14). Collection
methods for blood specimens were the
same across the surveys (13). In 1988­
1994, the OGTT was only performed in
individuals aged 40­74 years.
For NHANES 2005­2006, individu-
als with diagnosed diabetes from the in-
terviewed sample were combined with
individuals without diagnosed diabetes
from the FPG subsample for estimates in-
volving FPG, or the OGTT subsample for
estimates involving 2-h glucose (online
appendix Figure A1). Appropriate sam-
pling weights were used so that the sum of
the sample weights from the two groups
(interview and FPG or OGTT subsample)
added to the total U.S. population. For
NHANES 1988­1994, prevalences of
normal glucose and undiagnosed diabetes
(based on FPG or 2-h glucose), IFG, and
IGT in the subsamples of people without
diagnosed diabetes were each adjusted for
the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes from
the interviewed sample so that the sum of
all diagnostic categories added to the total
U.S. population (15). This difference in
approach for NHANES 1988­1994 was
required because sampling weights pro-
vided for the FPG and OGTT subsamples
for that survey did not account for some
individuals having invalid or unknown
fasting times or unknown plasma glucose
values.
We standardized estimates to the U.S.
2000 Census population by age and sex
using the direct method with age catego-
ries of 12­19, 20­39, 40­59, and 60
years for estimates in people aged 12
and 20 years and age categories of
40­59 and 60­74 years for estimates in
those aged 40­74 years. The ratio of un-
diagnosed to total diabetes was also stan-
dardized to the total U.S. 2000 Census
population. SUDAAN (16) was used to
calculate SEs in NHANES 2005­2006
based on the Taylor series linearization
method (17). For NHANES 1988­1994,
variance estimates were based on Fay's
modified balanced repeated replication
(18), reflecting the method used to com-
bine the interviewed and FPG/OGTT sub-
samples.
For NHANES 2005­2006, we used
one-sample Student's t tests for testing
whether differences between subgroups
in proportions were significantly different
from zero. Two-sample Student's t tests
were used to test differences in propor-
tions between the two surveys. A P value
0.05 was considered statistically signif-
icant. The degrees of freedom used reflect
the complex sample design.
RESULTS
Prevalences in 2005­2006
Diagnosed diabetes. The crude preva-
lence of diagnosed diabetes in individuals
aged 20 years was 7.7% (Table 1). Prev-
alence increased with age and peaked at
age 60­74 years (crude 17.6%), falling
slightly in older ages. Crude and stan-
dardized prevalences were similar in men
and women. Crude prevalence was signif-
icantly higher in non-Hispanic blacks
(12.8%) than in non-Hispanic whites
(6.6%; P  0.0001) and Mexican Ameri-
cans (8.4%; P  0.008); standardized
prevalences were significantly higher in
non-Hispanic blacks (P  0.0001) and
Mexican Americans (P  0.0001) than in
non-Hispanic whites.
Undiagnosed diabetes (FPG). The
crude prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes
based on FPG was 2.5% among individu-
als aged 20 years (Table 1). Prevalence
was much higher in those aged 60 years
than in people of younger ages. The
higher prevalences of undiagnosed diabe-
tes in men than in women were not sig-
nificantly different (crude P  0.12;
standardized P  0.08). There were no
statistically significant differences be-
tween race/ethnic groups.
Undiagnosed diabetes (2-h OGTT glu-
cose). The crude prevalence of undiag-
nosed diabetes based on 2-h glucose was
4.9% among people aged 20 years, ap-
proximately twofold higher than preva-
lences of undiagnosed diabetes based on
FPG (Table 1). Similar to the case of un-
diagnosed diabetes based on FPG, preva-
lence based on 2-h glucose was much
higher in those aged 60 years than in
those of younger ages. No differences in
prevalence were found by sex. Standard-
ized prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes

based on 2-h glucose was significantly
higher in Mexican Americans compared
with non-Hispanic blacks (7.0 vs. 4.1%;
P  0.04) but not compared with non-
Hispanic whites (7.0 vs. 4.9%; P  0.14).
Total undiagnosed diabetes. The com-
bined crude prevalence of undiagnosed
diabetes based on FPG or 2-h glucose was
5.1% in people aged 20 years (Table 1).
Prevalence was much higher in people
aged 60 years than in those of younger
ages. Prevalence did not differ signifi-
cantly by sex or race/ethnicity, even in
Mexican Americans compared with non-
Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks
(standardized, both P  0.07).
Total diabetes. The combined crude
prevalence of diabetes, based on diag-
nosed and undiagnosed diabetes detected
by FPG or 2-h glucose, was 12.9% in peo-
ple aged 20 years (Table 1). Total prev-
alence of diabetes increased steadily with
age and peaked at about 30% in all age
groups 60 years. Total diabetes preva-
lence was virtually the same in men and
women. Compared with non-Hispanic
whites aged 20 years, total diabetes
prevalence was about 70% higher in non-
Hispanic blacks (P  0.0001) and 80%
higher in Mexican Americans (P 
0.0008) after accounting for differences
in age and sex distributions.
Proportion of undiagnosed total diabe-
tes. The proportion of total diabetes that
was undiagnosed was almost 40% in
those aged 20 years and increased mod-
erately with age (Table 1). The proportion
of total diabetes that was undiagnosed
was similar in men and women aged 20
years. A significantly higher proportion
was undiagnosed in non-Hispanic whites
aged 20 years (crude 46.0%) and Mex-
ican Americans (crude 43.0%) than in
non-Hispanic blacks (24.2%; both P 
0.02); racial differences were not ex-
plained by different age and sex distribu-
tions, as shown in the standardized ratios.
IFG. In individuals aged 20 years,
25.7% had IFG (Table 2). IFG increased
with age, doubling between ages 20­39
and 40­59 years, and then remained con-
stant at 60 years. IFG prevalence was
significantly higher in men (crude 32.1%)
than in women (crude 19.8%; both crude
and standardized P  0.0001). No statis-
tically significant differences in preva-
lence were observed by race/ethnicity.
IGT. IGT was found in 13.8% of those
aged 20 years, about half the prevalence
of IFG (Table 2). Prevalence steadily in-
creased with age, peaking at 35.1% in
those aged 75 years. Prevalences did
not differ significantly by sex or race/
ethnicity.
Total pre-diabetes. The crude preva-
lence of either IFG or IGT was 29.5%
among people aged 20 years (Table 2).
Prevalence increased with age, peaking at
age 75 years (crude 46.7%). Prevalence
was much higher in men than in women
(aged 20 years crude 36 vs. 23.4% and
standardized 35.7 vs. 22.8%; both P 
0.0002). The somewhat higher preva-
lence in Mexican Americans than in non-
Hispanic whites or non-Hispanic blacks
was not significantly different.
Total diabetes (diagnosed and undiag-
nosed) and pre-diabetes (IFG and
IGT). The total combined crude preva-
lence of diabetes and pre-diabetes was
42.3% in people aged 20 years (Table 2
and online appendix Figures A2 and A3).
Prevalence rose steadily with age, with
crude prevalence reaching 75.7% in peo-
ple aged 75 years. Prevalence of any hy-

lence of pre-diabetes in men. Whereas
crude prevalence of any hyperglycemic
condition was not significantly different
by race/ethnicity, standardized preva-
lence was significantly higher in non-
Hispanic blacks (aged 20 years 44.1%)
compared with whites (38.7%; P  0.01)
and significantly higher in Mexican Amer-
icans (52.0%) compared with non-
Hispanic whites (P  0.004) but not
compared with non-Hispanic blacks (P 
0.06).
Comparison of FPG and 2-h glucose
values
Among those classified as diabetic or nor-
mal by FPG, 90% were classified like-
wise by 2-h glucose (Table 3). However,
whereas the prevalence of undiagnosed
diabetes by FPG was 2.5%, the prevalence
by either definition was 5.1%; when com-
bined with diagnosed diabetes, total dia-
betes was 10.2 and 12.9%, respectively.
For people with IFG, there was much less
agreement between the classifications.
Only 31.3% of those with IFG also had
IGT, comprising 8.1% of the population.
Among those defined as having IFG, 8.5%
were classified as having diabetes based
on 2-h glucose. This largely explains the
doubling of the prevalence of undiag-
nosed diabetes based on 2-h glucose com-
pared with undiagnosed diabetes based
on FPG, as described earlier; 2.2% of the
population comprised this category. In
contrast, 60% of those with IFG were clas-
sified by 2-h glucose as having normal
glucose tolerance. This explains the ap-
proximate halving of prevalence of pre-
diabetes based on the 2-h glucose,
compared with the prevalence of IFG, as
described earlier. Although 8.5% of those
with IFG were classified by 2-h glucose as
having diabetes, the mean A1C of this
group (5.80%) was within the normal
range.
Trends in prevalences from 1988­
1994 to 2005­2006
The crude prevalence of diagnosed diabe-
tes in individuals aged 20 years rose sig-
nificantly from 5.1% in 1988­1994 to
7.7% in 2005­2006 (P  0.0001) (online
appendix Tables A1 and A2); this was sig-
nificant after accounting for differences in
age/sex distributions between the two
surveys (P  0.0002). The rise in preva-
lence occurred for all groups but was par-
ticularly dramatic for non-Hispanic
blacks (crude 6.9 to 12.8%, P  0.0001;
standardized 8.4 to 13.9%, P  0.0001).
There were no significant changes be-
tween the surveys in prevalence of undi-
agnosed diabetes (FPG, 2-h glucose, or
total undiagnosed); however, the small
sample sizes in 2005­2006 may limit the
ability to detect changes for subgroups.
Total diabetes (diagnosed and undiag-
nosed) prevalence changed significantly
only for non-Hispanic blacks (aged
40­74 years crude 20.3 to 26.1%, P 
0.007; standardized 20.2 to 27.1%, P 
0.001). Whereas the proportion of total
diabetes that was undiagnosed appeared
to decrease between the surveys for all
groups, changes were only significant in
Mexican Americans (aged 40­74 years
crude 44.9 to 30.0%; P  0.02).
There was no substantial change in
prevalence of IFG or IGT between 1988­
1994 and 2005­2006. Likewise, total
pre-diabetes (IFG or IGT) did not change
significantly except in Mexican Ameri-
cans (aged 40­74 years standardized
41.7 to 33.1%; P  0.03). The combined
total prevalence of diabetes and pre-
diabetes increased significantly between
the surveys only in non-Hispanic blacks
(aged 40­74 years standardized 53.3 to
61.4%; P  0.01). The decrease in prev-
alence in Mexican Americans was not sig-
nificant (aged 40­74 years standardized
67.1 to 59.8%; P  0.06).
CONCLUSIONS -- These recent
data indicate that 12.9% of the adult U.S.
population aged 20 years have diabetes
(7.7% previously diagnosed and 5.1%
undiagnosed), of which 39.8% is undiag-
nosed. Another 29.5% of the population
is at risk of diabetes based on having pre-
diabetes (IFG or IGT). Overall, approxi-
mately 40% of the U.S. population has
some hyperglycemic condition. The el-

Prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes

derly population is particularly suscepti-
ble, with about one-third having
diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes and
three-quarters having diabetes or pre-
diabetes. Minority groups continue to suf-
fer disproportionately, as prevalence of
diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes
combined is 70­80% higher in non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans
than in non-Hispanic white subjects. But
whereas diagnosed diabetes has risen
significantly over the last 10­15 years,
particularly in non-Hispanic blacks,
undiagnosed diabetes as a proportion of
total diabetes has remained relatively
stable and may be decreasing, particu-
larly in Mexican Americans.
NHANES is unique because its results
represent people in the U.S. noninstitu-
tionalized population, and the survey, in
contrast with other national surveys, in-
cludes a laboratory component that mea-
sures FPG. NHANES was particularly
unique in 2005­2006 because of inclu-
sion of an OGTT not previously per-
formed since 1988­1994. The FPG is
recommended for screening for diabetes
and IFG because it is more reproducible
and convenient and less costly. FPG and
2-h OGTT glucose, however, measure
different physiological phenomena (4).
Two-hour glucose is more sensitive than
FPG to detecting glucose defects in the
elderly (7). Whereas 91% of people hav-
ing diabetes by FPG were likewise classi-
fied by 2-h glucose, the 2-h glucose added
another 2.6% of diabetes prevalence. The
corresponding figure among people aged
40­74 years in NHANES 1988­1994
was 2.0%, which is not significantly dif-
ferent (9). There was substantial disagree-
ment among those having IFG, in whom
8.5% were diabetic and 60.2% normogly-
cemic based on 2-h glucose. This explains
the doubling of the prevalence of undiag-
nosed diabetes based on 2-h glucose
(aged 20 years crude 2.5% by FPG,
4.9% by 2-h glucose, and 5.1% having
either) and halving of pre-diabetes (aged
20 years crude 25.7% by FPG,13.8% by
2-h glucose, and 29.5% having either).
We note that determination of undi-
agnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes by ei-
ther FPG or 2-h glucose was based on a
single plasma glucose reading from sub-
jects who self-reported that they fasted
appropriately, whereas retesting is sug-
gested for diagnosis in a clinical setting.
Consequently, some of the prevalence es-
timates may be overstated. In addition,
the available sample size in 2005­2006
limited the ability to detect differences.
Nevertheless, some important differences
were detected between groups and over
time.
As shown in previous reports (3), di-
agnosed diabetes remains more than
twice as high in non-Hispanic blacks and
Mexican Americans than in non-Hispanic
whites, after accounting for differences in
age and sex distributions. The racial/
ethnic disparity is reflected in prevalence
of total diabetes (diagnosed and undiag-
nosed) and total hyperglycemic condi-
tions. Undiagnosed diabetes was not
greater in these groups.
Diagnosed diabetes increased signifi-
cantly between 1988­1994 and 2005­
2006 in all age groups and in both men
and women. The rise in prevalence of di-
agnosed diabetes was particularly promi-
nent in non-Hispanic blacks and was
reflected in a rise in total diabetes and to-
tal hyperglycemic conditions over time
(most prominently in non-Hispanic
blacks).
Based on both FPG and 2-h glucoses,
almost 40% of total diabetes was undiag-
nosed. The proportion that was undiag-
nosed was significantly higher in non-
Hispanic whites than in Mexican
Americans. The proportion of total diabe-
tes that was undiagnosed tended to de-
crease between the surveys, but this was
statistically significant only among Mexi-
can Americans.
Thus, whereas diagnosed and total di-
abetes and total hyperglycemic condi-
tions remain disproportionately high in
minority groups, it may be that diabetes is
being diagnosed more frequently in these
groups, both over time and relative to
non-Hispanic whites. This was also found
when comparing data from 1999­2002
with those from 1988­1994 (3). More fo-
cused screening may be occurring in these
groups (19). Decreases over the past sev-
eral decades in the proportion of diabetes
that is undiagnosed have occurred only
among the most obese (20). We also
found that pre-diabetes decreased signif-
icantly over time in Mexican Americans.
Overall, almost 30% of the popula-
tion had pre-diabetes (IFG or IGT), a con-
dition that increases the risk for diabetes
and is associated with other cardiovascu-
lar risk factors (4,8). In 2005­2006, IFG
was 70% higher in men than in women,
consistent with findings in 1999­2002
(3). This was reflected in their higher
prevalences of total pre-diabetes and total
hyperglycemic conditions. No differences
by sex, however, were found in the prev-
alence of diagnosed or undiagnosed dia-
betes. These observations currently lack
explanation. It is encouraging that preva-
lence of pre-diabetes did not appear to
increase between the surveys; this is sur-
prising given the increase in diagnosed
diabetes and obesity (10) over time.
The sheer magnitude of prevalence of
hyperglycemic conditions found in
2005­2006 portends all the conse-
quences of diabetes including its myriad
of complications and costs both to indi-
viduals and to society. The prevalence of
diabetes continues to increase over time
but appears to be recognized more com-
monly. Despite some evidence that over-
weight and obesity may be plateauing in
adults (21) and adolescents (22), their
prevalences remain high; and, even in ad-
olescents, features of insulin resistance
are found in the presence of IFG (23).
Lifestyle modification including weight
management and increased physical ac-
tivity should be prescribed and practiced
in those with diabetes (24) and pre-
diabetes (25), particularly in minority
groups.
