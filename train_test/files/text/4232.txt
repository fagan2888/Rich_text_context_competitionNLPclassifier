Abstract: Positive sexual imprinting is a process by which individuals use the phenotype
of their opposite-sex parent as a template for acquiring mates. Recent studies in humans
have concluded that an imprinting-like mechanism influences human mate choice in facial
traits. However, some of the previous studies have had methodological problems or flaws
which might have invalidated or led to an overgeneralization of the original interpretation
of their results. In this study, 70 heterosexual adults were used to test if their partners
resembled facially their opposite-sex parent as the sexual imprinting hypothesis predicts.
Judges assessed the subjective facial similarity between each participant's partner and their
parent. We found that there was no perceived facial similarity between women's partners
and their fathers. However, men tended to pair more often with women that were perceived
as resembling the men's own mothers. In contrast to previous studies, the quality of the
relationship between participants and their parents did not predict the level of facial
resemblance between the participant's spouse and their parent.

Introduction
Positive sexual imprinting has been defined as a sexual preference for individuals
possessing the characteristics of one's parents (Pfaus, Kippin, and Centeno, 2001). It is said
to be a result of acquiring sexual preferences via exposure to the parental phenotype during
a sensitive period in early childhood. Since the first works of Konrad Lorenz, sexual
imprinting has been examined experimentally in fish (e.g., Schielzeth, Burger, Bolund, and
Forstmeier, 2008), birds (e.g., ten Cate, Verzijden, and Etman, 2006), and mammals (e.g.,
Kendrick, Hinton, and Atkins, 1999; Penn and Potts, 1998). It has been found that, during
pair formation, adults tend to prefer sexual partners of the species that gave them parental
care when young rather than other adults of their own species (Immelmann, Prove, Lassek,
and Bischof, 1991; ten Cate et al., 2006).

Likewise, studies using novel or artificially exaggerated ornaments in birds have
found positive sexual imprinting on these ornaments (ten Cate and Bateson, 1989). Early
research seemed to show that imprinted preferences are life-long, however more recent
studies suggest that sexual preferences in cross-fostered individuals might depend upon the
first courtship with a mate from the same or cross-fostered species, and that the process of
imprinting might have two stages that influence the magnitude of long-lasting effects: (1)
acquisition and (2) consolidation (Bischof and Clayton, 1991; Oetting, Prove, and Bischof.,
1995). Thus, sexual imprinting might not be fixed during adolescence, as previously
thought, and may change as a result of social experiences (as found by Oetting and Bischof,
1996).
Although positive sexual imprinting affects species recognition and preference
between color morphs or novel ornaments, these have been tested as categorical variables;
to our knowledge there is only one cross-fostering experiment on non-human animals that
tested the role of sexual imprinting on continuously variable traits. Schielzeth et al. (2008)
cross-fostered female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, and subsequently gave them a
choice between unfamiliar mates, one of which was a genetic son of their foster parents.
They found that cross-fostered females demonstrated neither significant avoidance nor
preference towards the genetic sons of their foster parents. Additionally, it has been shown
in birds that a conspecific sexual preference can occur in individuals that have not
socialized with any other individual. This result would suggest that animals have an innate
conspecific sexual preference and sexual imprinting merely refines this bias in natural
conditions (e.g., Gallagher, 1977).
Although previous research suggests that positive sexual imprinting plays an
important role in species recognition (Hansen, Johannessen, and Slagvold, 2007) and in
preferences for novel ornaments in zebra finches (Witte and Caspers, 2006), it remains
possible that it does not affect mating preferences for traits that display the whole span of
possible variations in natural circumstances (Schielzeth et al., 2008). Thus, more studies
testing the role of sexual imprinting on continuously variable traits within the same species
are needed before any generalization can be made.
In humans, there is some evidence for positive assortative mating according to
parental hair and eye color (Laeng, Mathisen, and Johnsen, 2007; Little, Penton-Voak,
Burt, and Perret, 2003; Wilson and Barrett, 1987), which simply means that the hair and
eye colors of sexual partners correlate positively with the hair and eye colors of parents.
Moreover, it has been reported that the effect of the opposite-sex parent is significantly
stronger than the same-sex parent in predicting both the hair and eye colors of actual
partners (Little et al., 2003). Little and colleagues suggested that their study supported an
"imprinting-like" (analogous to "social learning") effect on mate choice. Two groups of
researchers have found slight correlations between the ages of women's actual partners and
their parents (Wilson and Barrett, 1987; Zei, Astofli, and Jayaker, 1981) and this effect is
supported by a study using computer-graphic digitally modified faces (Perrett et al., 2002).
Although the methods used for these studies were robust, the association between parental
hair and eye color and human mate choice may have alternative explanations, such as
heritable preferences, that would affect results of the positive sexual imprinting (see
Rantala and Marcinkowska, 2011).

Bereczkei, Gyuris, Koves, and Bernath (2002) tested the positive sexual imprinting
hypothesis on facial traits in humans by measuring the resemblance of married women to
their mothers-in-law. Participants were reported to have correctly matched the wives to
their mothers-in-law at a significantly higher rate than expected by chance. Bereczkei
continued his research in the same field by studying the sexual preferences of married
women who were adopted as children. He asked judges to rank the similarity between
pictures of a woman's adoptive father, her husband and three randomly chosen controls.
The facial photos of husbands and adoptive fathers resembled each other significantly more
than expected by chance (Bereczkei, Gyuris, and Weisfeld, 2004). Another study correlated
facial measurements taken from people from the same family, and then compared that data
with measurements taken from randomly selected individuals from the same population
(Bereczkei, Hegedus, and Hajnal, 2009). It was concluded that the study supported the
positive sexual imprinting hypothesis. However, after the external expert appointed by the
journal identified errors in the data analysis (which could have altered the results of the
research), the authors decided to retract the article (see Bereczkei et al., 2009; retraction
and publishers note); hence its results should not be taken into further discussion.
To test the role of sexual imprinting on actual mate preferences, Wiszewska,
Pawlowski, and Boothroyd (2007) compared the facial traits of men to the preferences for
male facial traits of their daughters. They found that women who had a good relationship
with their fathers as children showed a stronger preference in other men for some of the
characteristics of their father's face, compared with women who had negative or neutral
relationships with their fathers. However, again, the results of this experiment may be
difficult to interpret because the authors excluded the majority of average stimuli faces
(Wiszewska et al., 2007, p. 249). The effects of sexual imprinting on facial preferences
that were found in this study were thus only present in a subset of the original data, which
was not randomly selected; as average faces were excluded, only more extreme
characteristics of faces were presented. A broader data set may have altered the results and
conclusions of the paper, especially if women preferred faces close to the population mean.
Based on this paper, then, it seems that there is evidence for positive sexual imprinting for
human facial traits in faces that deviate from the average, but it is unclear to what extent
this is generalizable. What is more, Zietsch and colleagues, in a recent study on twins,
found no effects of sexual imprinting in any of their examined traits and near zero genetic
influence on mate choice (Zietsch, Verweij, Heath, and Martin, 2011). It was suggested that
partner similarity was based rather on assortative mating.
The aim of this study was to test the sexual imprinting hypothesis by measuring the
facial resemblance between participants' spouse's faces and that of their opposite-sex
parents. We based our methods of the retracted study of Bereczkei et al. (2009), on a data
set of long-term white Caucasian couples currently living in southern Poland. We also used
this data set to investigate the impact of the quality of child-parent interactions on positive
sexual imprinting. Following other authors (e.g., Schmitt et al., 2012), we see value in
replication and re-evaluation of hypotheses with different methods and in different
populations.

Materials and Methods
Participants
The participants were from 70 families. From each family, we used three people: a
participant, the participant's partner, and the participant's opposite-sex parent. In total, we
used 210 volunteers, aged between 18 and 66 years (M = 24.78, SD = 3.73). The
participants had to have been in a relationship with their current partner for at least six
months (M = 3.78 years, SD = 3 years). The mean age of male participants was 25 years
(SD = 4.05); for female participants it was 24.6 years (SD = 3.35). There were 37 females
and 33 males. Individuals were unsystematically chosen, all white, Caucasian, heterosexual
couples. We recruited them using several methods: Internet forums, leaving invitations to
take part in the research on the information desks in the universities, asking people
opportunistically encountered on the university campus in Cracow, and, finally, by asking
participants to forward the information about the research to their acquaintances.
Two digital photographs were taken of the face of each participant, spouse and
parent: one from the front and one of the profile. Photos were taken with different cameras,
but with the same settings (i.e., same size of the picture, time of exposure, and brightness
control). It was not necessary to take all profile pictures from the same side, because
reference points were marked to the profile line. Each participant was asked to stand still
and to look straight ahead or directly into the camera, which was placed at eye level. In
total, 420 pictures were taken by five different photographers who were instructed how to
take the pictures and followed similar procedures. All pictures were standardized in size
and resolution. Pictures of partners and family members were usually taken on different
occasions and in different places, hence there was no consistency between them in terms of
their physical context (e.g., lighting, color, and shading).
Facial Similarity Ratings
For each participant, we presented a tableau of five color, frontal, facial
photographs in a similar manner as used in previous papers (e.g., Bereczkei et al., 2002,
2004). They displayed on the left-hand side the picture of the participant's opposite-sex
parent identified by a number. On the right-hand side there were four photographs of three
individuals of the partner's age taken from the control group and a photograph of the actual
partner of the participant. The control group was created by gathering individuals from
southern Poland, unsystematically asking students on the campus. They did not know the
individuals approached. The age of control group individuals, 18 to 30 years old, was in the
same range as the age of the participants. Each of the four pictures of potential partners was
marked with a single letter from A to D. We chose to present four pictures from the
participant's control age group. This is because a parent is a fixed stimulus presented
throughout the individual's sensitive phases as an individual grows, whilst a partner is
hypothesized to have been chosen based upon that stimulus. Opportunistically chosen
judges from southern Poland (i.e., other students from the campus and people encountered
in the street; n = 120), were asked to rate the faces coded A to D on their similarity to the
numbered, opposite-sex parent's face on a scale from 1 (not at all similar) to 10 (extremely
similar) (see Bereczkei et al., 2009). The tableaux of five pictures were shown to each
Sexual imprinting

judge in a randomized order. Judges neither knew, nor recognized, the presented
individuals.
Questionnaires
Each participant completed two questionnaires in the Polish language. The first
questionnaire was a shortened form of the EMBU questionnaire ­ Swedish acronym for
"My memories of upbringing." It measures relations between the parent and child during
the first ten years of his/her life (Arrindell et al., 1999), which is a standardized method for
the assessment of an adult's perception of their parents' rearing behavior. This
questionnaire was translated independently by two Polish native speakers with CAE
Cambridge certification, and their versions were consistent. The second questionnaire
consisted of general questions about demographics and personal information about the
participant and his/her parents and partner.
Data Analyses
Since Kolmogorov­Smirnov analysis revealed that the data on ratings of facial
resemblance were not normally distributed we transformed the data by taking the log (base
10), after which the data were normally distributed. Thus, we used parametric tests to
compare facial resemblance between opposite sex parent with mate and controls. Since
EMBU scores were not normally distributed and we were not able to transform it, we used
non-parametric correlations between EMBU scores and facial resemblances. All statistical
tests were performed with PASW Statistics 18 software and all tests were two-tailed.
Results
Mothers were subjectively rated to be more similar to their daughters-in-law than
controls on average, t(30) = 2.84, p = 0.008, whereas fathers were not more similar to their
sons-in-law than controls on average, t(37) = 0.94, p = 0.356 (see Figure 1). Thus, it seems
that men tend to pair with women who resemble their mother more likely than we would
expect by chance, but women do not tend to pair with men who resemble their father. We
also found that mothers were rated as more similar to their daughters-in-law than fathers
were to their sons-in-law, t(67) = 2.044, p = 0.045, which may be suggesting that people
are significantly better at seeing resemblance in mothers/daughters-in-law than in
fathers/sons-in-law.
To test if the quality of the relationship between a participant and his/her parent had
any effect on the facial resemblance between the spouse of participant and their parent, we
tested whether facial similarity rating correlated with EMBU scores. The EMBU
questionnaire provided us with three main factors influencing parent-child relations:
rejection, emotional warmth, and over-protection. However, none of the factors in either
sex correlated with facial similarity ratings (see Table 1).

Discussion
Our study was designed to test for facial resemblances between spouses and
opposite-sex parents as predicted by the sexual imprinting hypothesis. We found that men
tend to pair more often with women that facially resemble their mothers than expected by
chance. In contrast, judges were not able to see facial similarity between fathers and their
Sexual imprinting

sons-in-law. Interestingly, the quality of the relationship between a participant and their
parent was not associated with facial resemblance between the spouse of the participant and
their parent. Thus, our results support only partly those of Bereczkei et al. (2002, 2004)
who found that good parental relationships were associated with higher similarity ratings
between opposite-sex parents and spouses (for possible explanations of lack of correlation,
see Rantala and Marcinkowska, 2011).
Furthermore, our study is not consistent with the mathematical model of Tramm
and Servedio (2008), who found that imprinting may depend on the level of engagement of
the parent in rearing offspring (i.e., if the mother is the one providing care, maternal
imprinting should be stronger, and vice versa for the father). It is possible that the pattern
we found is the result of positive sexual imprinting on facial traits of the opposite-sex
parent, but since the relationship with the mother did not predict the facial resemblance
between mother and spouse, our study suggests that facial resemblance might also be the
result of heritable components for facial preferences. Unfortunately, in our study we were
not able to rule out genetic effects or preferences for self-similarity because we did not
include adoptive families. However, if the facial similarity between fathers and their sons-
in-law were so weak that raters were not able to see it, it is unlikely that in adopted families
the similarity would be any higher. In addition, our study does not support the finding of
Wiszewska et al. (2007) who claimed that women who had a good relationship with their
father as a child showed a stronger preference in other men for some characteristics of their
father's face. It does not support either the results of Watkins et al. (2011), who found a
positive correlation between women's preferences for self-resemblance in opposite-sex (but
not same-sex) individuals and reported emotional closeness to their fathers. Watkins et al.
(2011) examined reported emotional closeness based on only 1 item; however, this should
be sufficient to depict parental support (e.g., Hall, 2009) and hence should not be the cause
of our discrepant results. The cause of divergence might lay in the fact that Watkins et al.
(2011) correlated parental support with self-similarity, not with the actual partner ­
opposite sex parent similarity (which as variables are not unequivocal).
Another factor that might explain the differences in sexual imprinting between
males and females is the Westermarck effect. It is known that individuals do feel sexual
aversion and tend not to bond with other individuals that were raised in the same peer or
family group (e.g., Bixler, 1981; Blouin and Blouin, 1988). It has been also shown that this
aversion is stronger for women than men (Walter and Buyske, 2003). In females, weaker
sexual attraction towards co-socialized individuals would support Trivers' (1972) parental
investment theory, which states that females should show greater inbreeding avoidance
than males because of the greater costs they suffer as a consequence of inbreeding
depression. As inbreeding-avoidance would be a factor that suppresses possible sexual
imprinting for parental traits, then the weaker inbreeding avoidance is, the stronger the
sexual imprinting. In other words, in females showing strong inbreeding avoidance, sexual
imprinting should be less visible, as it is suppressed more. Our data support this hypothesis.
It is noteworthy that among all animals, including humans, the actual state of
pairing does not always reflect the exact preferences of an individual. Competition to form
partnerships and many other socio-cultural constraints may prevent individuals from
pairing with people that bear their preferred traits (Burley, 1983). In previous research, the
Sexual imprinting
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(3). 2012. -628-
traits of partners were interpreted as identical with individual preferences, although it might
be that partners are the most preferred individuals from those that are available. Thus, it
might be misleading to base a template of preferences on the actual mate of the individual,
whilst ignoring the constraints of human mate choice. Additionally, as individuals within a
culture often have, on average, a common perception of what is physically attractive in the
opposite-sex, attractiveness may signal good genes (see Roberts et al., 2005; Rantala et al.,
2012), and a perception of certain facial qualities as attractive may have evolved as an
adaptation to the problem of choosing a high-quality mate (Buss and Schmitt, 1993).
Consequently, as attaining a high quality mate should enhance our fitness, it may be
adaptive to mate with high quality mates for all females, despite their own self-perception,
actual social position, etc. Hence the preferences of the majority of females would be
similar, with little apparent variance, regardless of parental features. This also might
explain why we did not find facial similarity between fathers and their sons-in-law.
In this study we retested Bereczkei et al.'s (2009) hypothesis with a more robust
methodology. Although their study was criticized, our results suggest that there may indeed
be facial similarities between spouses and their opposite-sex parents in men, as Bereczkei
et al. (2009) suggested. However, the effects we observed were substantially weaker than
the ones reported in previous studies. Furthermore, we did not find any support for previous
findings that good parental relationships were associated with higher similarity ratings
between opposite-sex parents and spouses. Since we did not use adoptive families in our
experiment, we were not able to say whether the pattern was a result of heritable
preferences or sexual imprinting.
