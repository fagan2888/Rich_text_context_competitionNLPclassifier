Background: To investigate whether the frequency of
carriers of mutations in the HFE gene associated with he-
reditary hemochromatosis diminishes with age as an in-
dication that HFE mutations are associated with in-
creased mortality. It is of value in the debate concerning
screening for hereditary hemochromatosis to determine
the significance of heterozygosity.
Methods: Genotyping for mutations in exons 2 and 4
of the HFE gene using denaturing gradient gel electro-
phoresis in 1784 participants aged 45 to 100 years from
4 population-based studies: all 183 centenarians from the
Danish Centenarian Study, 601 people aged 92 to 93 years
from the Danish 1905 Cohort, 400 aged 70 to 94 years
from the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins, and
600 aged 45 to 67 years from a study of middle-aged Dan-
ish twins.
Results: All participants (N=1784) were screened for mu-
tations in exon 4, and a trend toward fewer heterozygotes
for the C282Y mutation--the mutation most often asso-
ciated with hereditary hemochromatosis--was found. This
was significant for the whole population (P=.005) and for
women (P=.004) but not for men (P=.26). A group of 599
participantswasscreenedformutationsinexon2,andthere
was no variation in the distribution of mutations in exon
2 in the different age groups.
Conclusions: In a high­carrier frequency population like
Denmark, mutations in HFE show an age-related reduc-
tion in the frequency of heterozygotes for C282Y, which
suggests that carrier status is associated with shorter life
expectancy.

HEREDITARY hemachroma-
tosis is the most com-
mon inherited disease in
Europeans. It occurs in as
many as 5 in every 1000
individuals of northern European heri-
tage,1 with 10% to 15% of the population
being carriers of mutations in the HFE gene
associated with hereditary hemochroma-
tosis.
Hereditary hemochromatosis is due to
an abnormal absorption of iron from the in-
testine. As iron loading progresses, it leads
to irreversible damage of many organs and
tissues, resulting in hepatic fibrosis and cir-
rhosis, endocrine dysfunction, cardiomy-
opathy, or arthropathy.2 The classic
"bronzeddiabetes"(skinpigmentation,dia-
betesmellitus,andcirrhosis)representsonly
a small fraction of affected individuals, usu-
ally those in whom the diagnosis has been
undetected for many years. Hereditary he-
mochromatosis more often presents with
nonspecific complaints, such as joint pain,
fatigue, and abdominal pain.3
In 1996, the candidate gene for he-
reditary hemochromatosis, HFE, was iden-
tified.4 This gene codes for a transmem-
brane protein that is presumed to be
involved in the regulation of the intracel-
lular iron level. Three common muta-
tions have been found: C282Y, H63D, and
S65C. Studies1-8 in different countries have
shown that approximately 80% to 100%
of patients with clinically diagnosed he-
mochromatosis are homozygotes for the
C282Y mutation, whereas the impact of
H63D and S65C is more uncertain. It
seems likely that the compound hetero-
zygotes C282Y/H63D and C282Y/S65C are
at increased risk of developing hemochro-
matosis.5-8 The distribution of these mu-
tations differs in different populations. The
frequency of heterozygosity for C282Y is
9.6% in white people in the United States,9
17.3% in northern Ireland,10 13.2% in New
Zealand,11 9.6% in northern Germany,12
and 13.3% in Denmark.13 This mutation
is absent in populations of African, Asian,
or Australian descent.14
The importance of hereditary hemo-
chromatosis is based on its prevalence, its
remarkably diverse clinical spectrum, and

the fact that early treatment (ie, venesection) is effective
in preventing its clinical manifestations. The clinical di-
agnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis is established
much more rarely than expected, and strong associa-
tion between C282Y homozygosity and hereditary he-
mochromatosis makes it tempting to suggest population-
based genetic screening for this mutation.1,15 However,
several issues need to be clarified before the conditions
for screening are fulfilled. What proportion of individu-
als with hereditary hemochromatosis on a molecular level
will develop serious clinical manifestations, and what is
the impact on heterozygotes? Examinations of the fre-
quency of C282Y homozygotes in healthy populations
and in other diseases have shown that the clinical pen-
etrance of this mutation is low. Some studies16,17 have iden-
tified individuals who are homozygous for C282Y but do
not fulfill the clinical and biochemical criteria for hemo-
chromatosis.
Heterozygotes for mutations in HFE have signifi-
cantly higher serum iron and transferrin saturation11 and
a lower frequency of iron deficiency anemia.9 Further-
more, new studies strongly suggest a relation between
the storage of iron and cardiovascular diseases. Two stud-
ies18,19 have shown that heterozygosity for mutations in
HFE confers a significant increase in risk for cardiovas-
cular events in men and women. However, the evidence
for adverse effects of being a carrier is still sparse.
Iron is a potent promotor of generation of free radi-
cals--strong reactive ions that react with cell mem-
branes and cell organelles. Free radicals are believed to
play a role in the development of cancer and cardiovas-
cular diseases and in aging, although there is no good
experimental evidence.20,21 HFE mutations thus repre-
sent a group of common mutations that may affect the
aging processes, morbidity, and mortality possibly through
the accumulation of iron. Except for apolipoprotein E,22
no longevity-associated genes have been firmly estab-
lished, and the HFE mutations are of particular interest
because of the potential for prevention of harmful ef-
fects through venesection.
In this study, we genotyped 1784 individuals aged
45 to 100 years from population-based studies for mu-
tations in HFE to investigate whether the frequency of
heterozygotes for mutations in HFE diminishes by age.
If so, this would indicate that heterozygotes for the mu-
tations in HFE have increased mortality rates starting at
midlife.
RESULTS
A total of 599 samples were screened for mutations in
exon 2. The H63D and S65C mutations were found with
the same frequency across the age groups (Table 1). Exon
4, the clinically most important, was screened in all
samples. The C282Y carrier frequencies and 95% confi-
dence intervals are given in Table 2. The overall distri-
bution was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P=.4). All
samples showing variant band patterns were sequenced
(2 samples), and the following mutations were found in
exon 4: C917T (this participant was also heterozygous
for the H63D mutation in exon 2) and T1105C. The re-
duction in heterozygotes for C282Y is significant in the
population as a whole (P=.005) and in women (P=.004)
but not in men (P=.26). The frequency of heterozy-
gotes for C282Y in the youngest age group was 12.4% in
men and 19.5% in women, but this difference was not
significant (P=.09).
SUBJECTS, MATERIALS,
AND METHODS
We conducted 4 major surveys and collected bio-
logical material from 1995-1999: the Danish 1905 Co-
hort, all Danes born in 1905 (1632 DNA samples)23;
the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins, all
Danish twins 70 years and older (2265 DNA
samples)24; a study of middle-aged Danish twins, a
random sample of twin pairs born between 1931 and
1952 (4171 DNA samples)25; and the Danish Cente-
narian Study, all persons living in Denmark who cel-
ebrated their 100th birthday between April 1, 1995,
and May 31, 1996, and centenarians from the island
of Funen, who participated in the pilot study in 1994
(183 DNA samples).22,26 These studies comprised a
home-based 2-hour multidimensional interview and
sampling of DNA by means of a finger prick or a cheek
swab, except in the Danish Centenarian Study, in
which full blood samples were collected. We ran-
domly selected DNA samples from 600 individuals
in the middle-aged twins study and from 400 in the
Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins, but only
1 participant from each twin pair was included. From
the Danish 1905 Cohort, we selected 300 men and
301 women. From the Danish Centenarian Study,
DNA samples from all participants were included. This
selection scheme aimed at getting precise estimates
at middle ages and among the oldest old.
DNA samples were isolated from cheek swabs
and blood spots using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Exons 2 and 4 were
screened using denaturing gradient gel electropho-
resis27 after previous amplification using an external
set of primers. Exons 2 and 4 were analyzed in 599
samples (200 each from the Longitudinal Study of
Aging Danish Twins and middle-aged twins cohort
and 199 from the Danish 1905 Cohort) and only exon
4 was analyzed in the remaining samples. In case of
abnormal patterns, the relevant exons were se-
quenced using a Thermo Sequenase Fluorescent­
labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham, Phar-
macia Biotech Inc, Piscataway, NJ) and Alf Express
(Amersham, Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala,
Sweden).
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using
the 2 test. The 95% confidence intervals for the
proportion of heterozygotes for C282Y in an age
group were calculated using the normal distribution.
The 2 test for trend was used for comparing the fre-
quencies among the different age groups, and the
uncorrected 2 test was used for comparing propor-
tions.28 EpiCalc 2000 (version 1.02; Gilmann and
Myatt, Brixton, England) was used for statistical
analysis.

COMMENT
In this study, we investigated the frequency of carriers
of 3 common HFE gene mutations--C282Y, H63D, and
S65C--in different age groups. No apparent difference
was found for H63D and S65C (Table 1). However, the
results indicate an age-related reduction in the carrier fre-
quency of the hemochromatosis-related C282Y muta-
tion (Table 2). These findings are consistent with the hy-
pothesis that there may be a survival difference from
middle age onward, especially for women, among carri-
ers and noncarriers of the C282Y allele. The age-related
reduction is only minor after age 65 years--a trend that
has also been shown for obesity.29 Our data thus imply
that there is selection against carriers of C282Y and that
this manifests before age 65 years.
The observed reduction in C282Y carrier frequency
persisted until age 95 years; however, the frequency in the
centenarian group is the same as that in the youngest group
for both men and women. There are several possible ex-
planations for this. Although 183 centenarians is a large
sample,includingmostofthecentenariansinDenmarkwho
reachedage100yearsinthestudyyear,itisnotlargeenough
to give a reliable carrier frequency. This can be seen in the
broad95%confidenceintervalsinTable2;therefore,itmay
be a chance finding. Another possible explanation is that
heterozygosity for C282Y has a higher mortality rate in the
younger groups but becomes beneficial in the oldest old
(antagonistic pleiotropy). Furthermore, the fact that some
become octogenarians or nonagenarians with a "bad" gene
could be balanced by a good composition of other rel-
evant genes or lifestyle, making it more likely that they be-
come centenarians.
There are several limitations to our study. The ma-
jor limitation is the inability to study directly the effect
of the C282Y allele on survival. The results suggest that
there is a survival difference, but more specific data on
the relationship of the C282Y allele to mortality rates are
needed before such a conclusion can be made because
the design used here is vulnerable to migration and as-
sociation to twin status. However, it seems unlikely that
migration or twin status should be associated with HFE
mutation status. Another limitation is that our study does
not give an idea of the mechanisms behind this survival
difference. It is tempting to suggest that the difference is
owing to accumulation of iron, but this should be fur-
ther investigated. It is well known that heterozygotes for
mutations in HFE have a higher iron content, but it has
until now been assumed that this was without signifi-
cant influence on morbidity and mortality rates. Our find-
ing that heterozygotes for C282Y may have reduced life
expectancy raises the question of whether the elevated
iron stores affect mortality and morbidity rates, al-
though some other effect of C282Y is possible.
It is well known that there is a low incidence of myo-
cardial infarction in menstruating women. The finding that
heterozygosity for mutations in HFE confers a significant
increase in risk for cardiovascular events in men and wom-

en18 is compatible with the hypothesis that iron plays an
important role in ischemic injury. In that case, iron deple-
tion could have a large protective effect.19 However, if the
accumulation of iron is in fact the mechanism behind this
apparently increased mortality rate among heterozygotes
for C282Y, then our study would probably underesti-
mate the increased mortality rate because several indi-
vidualswithoutthismutationmaynonethelesshavehigher-
than-normal stored iron levels owing to other known or
unidentified iron-loading mutations.
Several studies have demonstrated a familial aggre-
gation of premature myocardial infarction.30 Some of this
can be explained by hypertension or hyperlipidemia; how-
ever, in a large proportion of high-risk families, no ag-
gregation of the known risk factors is seen. It is possible
that this familial aggregation is due to a gene that favors
iron absorption.31 A relevant question then is whether
the increased mortality can be prevented by deliberate
iron depletion by regular blood donation, by recom-
mending a diet with a low iron content, or by warning
against taking vitamins that contain iron.
The finding of 3 homozygotes for C282Y (2 aged
93 years and 1 aged 70 years) is not surprising because
earlier studies have shown that the penetrance of heredi-
tary hemochromatosis in homozygotes for C282Y is low--
probably less than 50%. According to the Hardy-
Weinberg law, we should have found 6 participants
homozygous for C282Y, with an overall allele fre-
quency of 6%.
This study shows an age-related reduction in the car-
rier frequency of C282Y in the HFE gene, suggesting that
carriers have a shorter life expectancy. Our study does not
shed light on which mechanisms are behind this shorter
life expectancy or whether this increased mortality can be
prevented by, for instance, venesection. Future research
needs to elucidate this before a decision concerning popu-
lation-based screening for mutations in HFE is made.
