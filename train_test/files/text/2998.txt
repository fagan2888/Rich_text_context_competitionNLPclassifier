INITIALLY DESIGNED TO RESCUE PA-
tients experiencing a sudden car-
diac arrest due to arrhythmia,1 car-
diopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
has come to be seen as a procedure that
should be used for patients for whom
there is reasonable chance of restoring
cardiopulmonary function and pro-
longing life.2 Many guidelines, ar-
ticles, and legal actions recommend cir-
cumstances under which resuscitation
should be attempted.
The likelihood of survival after CPR
has been shown to vary with age and
disease.3 Decisions against attempting
CPR may be a component of care plans
that limit aggressiveness of care.4 Yet
decisions about CPR may reflect gen-
erally held expectations about particu-
lar diseases and perceptions of the ap-
propriateness of specific treatments,
rather than actual prognoses.5 Do-not-
resuscitate (DNR) orders are more com-
mon in patients with more functional
compromise and with increased age and
vary by diagnosis, sex, race, and loca-
tion.6 In the Study to Understand Prog-
noses and Preferences for Outcomes
and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT),
a study of seriously ill hospitalized pa-
tients, earlier DNR orders were associ-
ated with patient preferences to forego
resuscitation, worse overall progno-
sis, and age older than 75 years.7 In in-

Context The epidemiology of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders for hospitalized pa-
tients has been reported, but little is known about factors associated with the use of
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
Objective To identify factors associated with an attempt at CPR for patients who
experienced cardiopulmonary arrest.
Design Secondary analysis of data collected in 2 prospective cohort studies: the Study
toUnderstandPrognosesandPreferencesforOutcomesandRisksofTreatments(SUPPORT,
1989-1994) and the Hospitalized Elderly Longitudinal Project (HELP, 1994).
Setting Five teaching hospitals across the United States.
Participants A total of 2505 seriously ill hospitalized patients and nonelectively ad-
mitted persons aged 80 years or older who experienced cardiopulmonary arrest.
Main Outcome Measures Medical records data on CPR efforts, DNR orders, dis-
ease severity, age, race, sex, length of stay, and survival; functional status and pref-
erences concerning CPR obtained by interviews with patients or surrogates; and 2-month
survival estimates provided by physicians.
Results Five hundred fourteen study subjects (21%) received CPR during their index
hospitalization.Amongthem,327(63.6%)hadCPRwithin2daysofdeathand93(18.1%)
had resuscitation and survived their index hospitalization. Use of CPR was more likely
in men (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.73), younger pa-
tients(ORper10-yearincrease,0.90;95%CI,0.84-0.96),AfricanAmericans(OR,1.76;
95% CI, 1.33-2.34), patients whose reported preferences were for CPR (OR, 2.60; 95%
CI, 1.91-3.55), who reported better quality of life (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.10-2.03), or
who had higher physician estimates for 2-month survival (OR per 10% increase, 1.14;
95% CI, 1.09-1.19). Rates varied significantly with geographic location and diagnosis;
the adjusted OR for patients with congestive heart failure was 3.31 (95% CI, 2.12-5.15)
compared with patients with acute respiratory failure or multiple organ system failure.
Conclusions Our data suggest that a resuscitation attempt is more likely when pre-
ferred by patients and when death is least expected. Further study is required to under-
stand variation in use of CPR among sites and for patients with different diagnoses,
race, sex, or age.

tensive care units, DNR order rates have
increased and rates of initiation of CPR
have declined in the past decade.8-10 Sur-
prisingly, patient preferences about life-
extending treatment as reflected in liv-
ing wills have not been shown to alter
DNR decision making.11,12
SUPPORT and the Hospitalized El-
derly Longitudinal Project (HELP) were
designed to describe and improve de-
cision making and outcomes of care for
seriously ill or elderly hospitalized
adults.13 In SUPPORT, all patients were
hospitalized with 1 of 9 illnesses, se-
vere enough to have a high risk of dy-
ing in the ensuing 6 months. In HELP,
all patients were 80 years of age or older
and were enrolled at the time of emer-
gency hospital admissions. Many pa-
tients received life-prolonging inter-
ventions, and sometimes these
interventions conflicted with patients'
or surrogates' preferences for end-of-
life care.14
In both SUPPORT and HELP, among
patients who died or experienced suc-
cessful CPR during their enrollment
hospitalization, we examined the fea-
tures of the patient, the physician, and
the hospitalization to understand what
factors were associated with resuscita-
tion attempts among patients who ex-
perienced cardiopulmonary arrest. We
expected that the likelihood of having
CPR at the end of life would reflect pa-
tients' prognoses and preferences. We
aimed to measure the strength of those
associations and to assess the poten-
tial impact of other clinical and demo-
graphic factors.
METHODS
Study Population
The data collection methods used in
SUPPORT have been reported previ-
ously.13 From June 1989 to June 1991
(phase I) and from January 1992 to
January 1994 (phase II), SUPPORT en-
rolled patients 18 years of age or older
who met specific severity criteria for 1
of 9 serious illnesses (nontraumatic
coma, acute respiratory failure, mul-
tiple organ system failure with sepsis
and multiple organ system failure with
malignancy, chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease, congestive heart fail-
ure [CHF], cirrhosis, metastatic colon
cancer, or inoperable non­small cell
lung cancer) who were admitted to 1
of 5 medical centers: Beth Israel Hos-
pital, Boston, Mass; MetroHealth Medi-
cal Center, Cleveland, Ohio; Duke Uni-
versity Medical Center, Durham, NC;
St Joseph's Hospital, Marshfield, Wis;
and the University of California Medi-
cal Center at Los Angeles. Some pa-
tients were eligible for the study at the
time of admission; others became eli-
gible as their condition worsened while
in an intensive care unit. Patients were
excluded if they died or were dis-
charged within 48 hours of study en-
rollment; were admitted with a planned
discharge within 72 hours; did not
speak English; or had the acquired im-
munodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),
multiple trauma, or pregnancy. SUP-
PORT entry criteria and enrollment
have been reported in detail else-
where.15 In these analyses, we grouped
patients with acute respiratory failure
and patients with multiple organ sys-
tem failure and sepsis together be-
cause our previous work had found
them to be overlapping categories with
similar prognoses and treatments.16
HELP enrolled patients 80 years of
age and older, with any diagnosis ex-
cept elective surgery, AIDS, or mul-
tiple trauma, who had an unplanned
hospitalization for 48 hours or more at
1 of 4 teaching hospitals (Beth Israel
Hospital, MetroHealth Medical Cen-
ter, St Joseph's Hospital, and the Uni-
versity of California Medical Center at
Los Angeles)betweenFebruaryandNo-
vember 1994. Patients were assessed for
eligibility for HELP at the time of hos-
pital admission.
Institutional review committees at all
participating hospitals approved the
study. Informed consent was obtained
prior to interviews.
Data Collection
The data collection methods used in
HELP were identical to those in SUP-
PORT for the purposes of this analy-
sis. The following descriptive vari-
ables were recorded from medical
records: diagnoses including comor-
bid conditions,17 vital signs, common
laboratory values, and a clinical assess-
ment of neurological status using the
Glasgow Coma Scale. We obtained the
date of any attempt at CPR (documen-
tation in the medical record of a call for
the CPR team and their having initi-
ated CPR) and the date of death from
the record. Disease severity was as-
sessed using the Acute Physiology, Age,
Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)
III Acute Physiology Score (APS).13,18
Patients and their surrogate decision-
makers were interviewed in the first
week of entry into SUPPORT or HELP.
Interview data included demographic
factors, perceived quality of life (us-
ing a 5-point scale), and functional sta-
tus 2 weeks prior to admission using a
modified Katz activity of daily living
(ADL) scale ranging from 1 to 7
points.19 Patient interview data were
available for 233 subjects; for 1486 sub-
jects, the surrogate's response was cali-
brated to patients' responses and sub-
stituted as described previously.20 When
both patient and surrogate responses
were unavailable, we imputed ADL (for
814 patients) and quality of life values
(for 868 patients) using a logistic re-
gression model adjusting for patients'
interview status, diagnosis, age, coma
score, APS, comorbidities, dementia,
and sites.20 When we restricted our
analysis to patients without imputed
data, our results were unchanged; there-
fore, we present models including im-
puted data as our primary analysis.
Preferences about resuscitation were
assessed with the following question:
"As you probably know, there are a
number of things doctors can do to try
to revive someone whose heart has
stopped beating, which usually in-
cludes a machine to help breathing.
Thinking of your current condition,
what would you want your doctor to
do if your heart ever stops beating?: (1)
would want doctors to try to revive; (2)
would want doctors not to try to re-
vive; (3) would want CPR but no ven-
tilator; and (4) `don't know'"(the last 2
responses were recorded if the patient
or surrogate volunteered them). For our

analyses, responses 1 and 3 were in-
cluded as showing a preference for CPR.
Patients who responded "don't know"
were also considered as if they had
stated a preference for CPR, as would
be done in clinical practice. Surrogate
response for patients' preferences about
CPR were used for 1479 patients in this
analysis who could not be inter-
viewed; 601 patients died before their
interview and 1584 patients were in-
tubated, in coma, or otherwise unable
to communicate. All surrogate inter-
views reported here were conducted
prior to the patient's death. No data
about preferences were available for 820
subjects (32.7%), either because a sur-
rogate could not be identified or the pa-
tient or their surrogate declined to an-
swer the question.
In a separate interview within 5 days
of enrollment, but prior to patient
death, the most senior physician avail-
able on the treatment team was asked
to state the probability (0-100) that the
patient would live for 2 months or
more. Physician interview data were
available for 1972 patients.
Statistical Analysis
In this secondary analysis of SUP-
PORT and HELP data, we identified all
patients in the SUPPORT and HELP
studies who died during their index ad-
mission and/or received CPR during
their enrollment hospitalization. We
considered CPR to have been pro-
vided if we found chart documenta-
tion of CPR on or after the third day af-
ter study admission. Since patients were
excluded from SUPPORT if death oc-
curred during the first 48 hours of study
enrollment, we excluded all CPR at-
tempts tried on the first 2 calendar days
of study entry.
Patients were characterized with
descriptive statistics. To study the
bivariable association between CPR
attempts and patients' characteristics,
weused 2 teststoanalyzediscretevari-
ables and the Wilcoxon test for con-
tinuous variables. We used logistic
regression models to determine which
factors were associated with a CPR
attempt at the time of cardiopulmo-
nary arrest. Independent variables
included in the model were patient age,
race, sex, disease group, preferences for
CPR, APS on day 3, number of ADL
dependencies, patient reported qual-
ity of life, physician's estimate of
patients' 2-month survival, and study
site. We used the c statistic as a mea-
sure of the ability of the model to dis-
criminate between those who did and
thosewhodidnotreceiveaCPRattempt
(0.5 = no discrimination, 1 = perfect
discrimination).21 A2-sidedof.05was
used as the criterion for significance. In
a secondary analysis, we added to the
model whether the patient had a DNR
order prior to cardiopulmonary arrest
to explore whether variation in DNR
orders explained the variation in CPR
weobserved,butfoundthatDNRorders
were highly collinear with use of CPR,
resulting in substantial increases in SEs
and an unstable model. Separately, to
assess whether secular trends con-
founded our results, we also adjusted
for year of study entry and results were
similar to our primary analyses.
RESULTS
SUPPORT and HELP enrolled 10 281
subjects. Of these, 2505 subjects expe-
rienced cardiopulmonary arrest, and
514 (21%) received CPR on or after the
third study day during their index hos-
pitalization. Of the 514 patients who re-
ceived CPR, 93 (18.1%) survived the in-
dex hospitalization, and 327 (63.6%)
had CPR attempted within the last 2
days of life (293 on the calendar day of
death and 34 on the day before death).
TABLE 1 shows the age, sex, race, pri-
mary diagnosis, APS on the third study
day, ADL score, and quality of life 2
weeks prior to study entry, and the
number of comorbidities for patients
with and without an attempt at resus-
citation. Patient or surrogate prefer-
ence to attempt CPR was associated
with having CPR, yet 13% of patients
(or surrogates) who received CPR pre-
ferred to forego CPR, and 38% of pa-
tients who wanted CPR or were un-
sure did not receive CPR at the end of
life. Patients who had CPR were
younger, more often African Ameri-
can, and more often male. We found
substantial variation by site and diag-
nosis. Patients with fewer ADL depen-
dencies and better APS were more likely
to receive a CPR attempt.
Of the 514 patients who received
CPR on or after day 3 of the study en-
try, 15 (3%) had DNR orders written
on or before the day prior to the CPR
attempt, and 50 had DNR orders writ-
ten on the day of the attempt, while 449
had no DNR orders written. Of the 93
patients who survived CPR, 1 had a
DNR order written the day of the CPR
attempt, 8 had DNR orders written sub-
sequently, and 1 had a DNR order prior
to the CPR attempt. Of the 421 pa-
tients who had CPR but died during the
index hospitalization, 293 died on the
same day of the last CPR attempt, and
128 lived more than 1 day after the last
CPR attempt. Among the 293 patients
who died on the same day of the last
CPR attempt, 29 had DNR orders writ-
ten that day. Among the 128 who lived
more than 1 day after the last CPR at-
tempt, 93 had DNR orders written be-
fore death.
Of the 1991 patients who died with-
outCPRattempts,1802(91%)hadDNR
orders in place. Of the 189 patients who
died without DNR orders or a CPR at-
tempt, 75 had DNR decisions docu-
mented in the medical record without
aspecificDNRorder.Amongthe114re-
maining patients who died without a
CPR attempt prior to death or a DNR or-
der or note, 42 had preferred CPR, 24
had preferred to forego CPR, 9 were un-
sure, and 39 had no data available.
Of the 514 patients who had CPR, 74
(14%) had more than 1 CPR attempt
during the hospitalization. Of the 421
patients who had CPR but died during
the index hospitalization, 62 (15%) had
more than 1 CPR attempt. Of the 93 pa-
tients who had CPR and survived the
hospitalization, 12 (13%) had more
than 1 CPR attempt.
TABLE 2 shows the adjusted odds ra-
tios (ORs) for the factors that were sig-
nificant in the logistic regression model.
The multivariable model shows that the
adjusted likelihood of a resuscitative at-
tempt decreased with increasing age.

were less likely to undergo CPR than
those who had no preference or who

tion were more likely to receive CPR.
Neither APS nor functional status were
associated with the use of CPR.
Patients with CHF were most likely
to receive CPR. Patients in coma were
least likely to have a resuscitative ef-
fort. Use of CPR varied substantially
across sites. For patients at one site, the
OR for having CPR was 2.53 com-
pared with patients at another study in-
stitution. Physician prognostic esti-
mates were strongly associated with
receiving CPR; the OR for having CPR
increased by 0.14 for each 10% in-
crease in the likelihood of survival at
2 months. The c statistic for our mul-
tivariable model is 0.746.
COMMENT
Resuscitation was attempted for 514
(21%) of the 2505 patients who expe-
rienced cardiac arrest during their in-
dex hospitalization and 93 (18%) of 514
patients who had CPR survived their in-
dex hospitalization. Most patients who
died more than 1 day following a CPR
attempt had a DNR order written prior
to death. We found that the likelihood
of attempting resuscitation at the time
of cardiac or pulmonary arrest varies
substantially with prognosis and pref-
erences, quality of life, diagnosis, site
of hospitalization, and patient age, sex,
and race.
Mostmedicalethicistssuggestthatde-
cisions about resuscitation should be
guided by patient preferences and by the
likelihood of success of the resuscita-
tive effort or the patient's prognosis for
survival. In our study, the physician es-
timate of 2-month survival and patient
preference have an important effect on
use of CPR, but are similar in magni-
tude to other variables. Although less
than 60% of patients who had DNR or-
ders died during their initial hospital-
ization in SUPPORT,7 similar factors
were associated with the timing of DNR
orders among all patients in SUPPORT
and the use of CPR among patients ex-
periencing cardiopulmonary arrest. Pre-
vious work in SUPPORT identified a
strong association between patient pref-
erences and DNR orders,7 and in our
study, patients with a DNR order gen-
erally did not receive an attempt at re-
suscitation at the end of life. Although
there was a strong correlation between
preferences, DNR orders, and use of
CPR, 9% of patients who died without
CPR did not have a DNR order in place.
Of the 114 patients who died without a
CPR attempt, DNR order or note, 42 pa-
tients or their surrogates had ex-
pressed a preference for CPR.
Patients for whom we had no data
about preferences had a rate of CPR at-
tempt similar to those who preferred
CPR. Many of these subjects lacked a
ready surrogate who might have made

health care decisions to limit interven-
tions. Of patients or surrogates who
wanted CPR or were unsure, only 28%
received CPR, while 11% of patients
who did not want CPR received an at-
tempt at CPR. This lack of congru-
ency between preferences and treat-
ment may reflect changes in preferences
or prognoses in the time between in-
terviews and cardiopulmonary arrest or
misunderstood communication be-
tween patients and physicians. Physi-
cian decisions about CPR may be
heavily influenced by factors such as
their own values and preferences.22,23
Some clinical situations may appear to
offer so little hope of effectiveness of
CPR that physicians may not offer an
attempt at CPR to patients or surro-
gates. In other work, patient prefer-
ences were not associated with the use
of life-sustaining treatment.24
Our data show higher rates of CPR
attempts for patients for whom physi-
cians felt there was reasonable likeli-
hood of surviving 2 months. In a re-
cent study of intensive care unit
patients, severity of illness (APACHE
III score) was the most important vari-
able associated with a DNR order.25
Conversely, when death is not ex-
pected imminently, physicians may be
reluctant to forego resuscitation. How-
ever, even in end-stage disease, physi-
cians may have difficulty recognizing
that death is imminent.26,27
It may seem that decisions to forego
an attempt at CPR should not vary with
the type of disease after adjustment for
physician estimate of prognosis. How-
ever,characteristicsassociatedwithdis-
ease type may explain different pat-
terns of attempted resuscitation. For
example,reasonablywell-definedprog-
nosticmarkersareavailableforpatients
with incurable, metastatic cancer or
with coma, and when poor prognosis
is clear, many physicians and patients
avoid CPR. In fact, some question the
merits of making CPR available to ter-
minally ill cancer patients.28,29
However, for patients with other dis-
eases, the prognosis may be more un-
certain. Patients with end-stage CHF
follow a less predictable course,26,30 and
this diagnosis may be a more impor-
tant influence on the decision to at-
tempt CPR than the survival progno-
sis itself. Furthermore, despite a poor
long-term prognosis, patients with ad-
vanced CHF may be quickly resusci-
tated from an event caused by a car-
diac arrhythmia. Physicians may also
have different thresholds of perceived
chance of survival of patients for rec-
ommending CPR for patients with CHF
or chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease compared with those with can-
cer.31 The ambiguity in prognosis for
CHF and the ability of patients with
CHF to respond well to treatment even
late in the course may explain the in-
creased use of CPR for patients with
CHF compared with patients with other
diseases included in our study.
The patients who received resusci-
tation attempts did not significantly dif-
fer in severity of illness (as measured
by APS) on the third study day or in
functional status 2 weeks earlier, in the
adjusted analysis, when compared with

those who did not have a resuscitation
attempt. This contrasts with other re-
ports in which more functionally de-
pendent patients received less aggres-
sive care than others. However, our
measure for functional status may be
inaccurate, in part, because it was im-
puted (rather than reported directly by
patient or surrogate) for one third of our
subjects. Alternatively, for the seri-
ously ill patients included in SUP-
PORT, there may have been less varia-
tion in functional status compared with
those described in other studies. Ad-
ditionally, the strong correlation be-
tween prognostic estimate and mea-
sures of disease severity may have
dampened any possible effect of func-
tional status and APS on use of CPR in
our multivariable model. In contrast to
our findings on functional status, we
found that patients were more likely to
receive CPR if they reported better qual-
ity of life prior to hospitalization.
Several studies suggest that hospi-
talized older persons who are seri-
ously ill have similar rates of short- and
long-term success of resuscitation at-
tempts compared with younger pa-
tients.32,33 Long-term survival and func-
tional status were worse after successful
CPR for individuals older than 70 years
in another study.34 In our study, older
patients were less likely to receive CPR,
even after adjustment for patient pref-
erences and severity of illness. This ob-
servation is consistent with other ob-
servations that suggest that less
aggressive care is provided to older pa-
tients.35 Less aggressive care for older
persons may reflect patient and physi-
cian values.36,37 Other analyses of SUP-
PORT data found that older seriously
ill patients preferred CPR less often than
did younger patients.38 While differ-
ing preferences are not sufficient to ex-
plain the effect we document, older per-
sons or their families may be more
readily persuaded to avoid CPR as their
clinical situation worsens.
African American patients had higher
rates of attempts at CPR than non­
African Americans, even after adjust-
ments for their greater preference for
CPR. Differing priorities in end-of-life
care have previously been observed be-
tween various cultural and racial
groups,39,40 but it is unclear what ef-
fects these differences have on deci-
sions to attempt CPR at the end of life.
Variation in rates of attempted resus-
citation by site suggests that decisions
to attempt resuscitation are influ-
enced by the culture of local medical
practices. The influence of the institu-
tiononthelikelihoodofattemptingCPR
was more powerful than patients' pref-
erences,whichisdifficulttojustify.Pro-
found geographic variation in care for
the dying has been demonstrated in
other work.41,42 Understanding how
decisions about attempting resuscita-
tion are made in different settings and
what influences guide these decisions
may help to identify ways to improve
care for the seriously ill.
This study has several limitations.
First,ouranalysisfocusesonfactorsasso-
ciated with use of CPR but because we
restricted our analysis to the index hos-
pitalization, our data cannot be used to
estimate the longer-term survival of
patientsfollowingCPR.Additionally,in
ouranalysis,wedonotaccountforvaria-
tioninsuccessofCPRindifferentpatient
populations or in different institutions,
nor do we present data on factors asso-
ciatedwithsuccessfulCPR.However,the
likelihood of successful CPR is gener-
ally low in hospitalized patients, espe-
cially in those similar to patients in
SUPPORT.3,32,33 Both SUPPORT and
HELP were based in academic referral
hospitalsandmayhaveattractedpatients
more likely to desire aggressive care.
Limiting our description to those who
had successful CPR or died during their
initialhospitalizationexcludesinforma-
tion on outcomes experienced shortly
after hospital discharge or in other set-
tings. Since patients who died or were
discharged within the first 48 hours of
enrollment were excluded, our results
donotgeneralizetopatients'entirehos-
pital stay. Since we did not collect data
ontheexacttimeDNRorderswerewrit-
ten,weareunabletotellwhichoccurred
firstwhenaCPRattemptandDNRorder
occurred the same day. However, it is
likely that DNR orders were generally
written after CPR attempts when they
occurred on the same day.
Our reliance on surrogate re-
sponses and imputed interview data in
both SUPPORT and HELP may intro-
duce bias. Surrogates may not accu-
rately understand or predict patients'
preferences.43 Yet in many clinical set-
tings, surrogates function in a role of
decision maker. Functional status data
derived by imputing the number of
functional deficits from a logistic re-
gression model may reduce our ability
to find differences in functional status
among patient groups. Finally, our
analysis uses data from SUPPORT and
HELP collected from 1989 to 1994.
Practice patterns regarding CPR and
end-of-life care for seriously ill pa-
tients may have changed since these
data were collected.
We found that a CPR attempt was as-
sociated with patient or surrogate pref-
erences for CPR and the physician's es-
timate of better survival at 2 months.
However, the size of these effects is
modest and comparable to the effect of
other factors. The variation in use of
CPR across different diagnoses may be
explained by variability in the clinical
course of disease and prognostic un-
certainty. Patients' race, sex, age, and
site of hospitalization, however, had sig-
nificant effects that are more difficult
to explain. Future work to improve CPR
decision making should include per-
ceptions of CPR effectiveness and seek
to understand cultural forces in medi-
cal and lay communities that cause the
variations we observed. Additionally,
systems to ensure that patients' prefer-
ences are addressed and that DNR or-
ders are written and followed need fur-
ther attention and improvement.
