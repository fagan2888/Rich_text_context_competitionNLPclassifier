Reserve Requirements and Economic Stabilizationl
I. Introduction
In numerous journal articles2 and official statements by central banks3
, the allocative
advantages of minimum reserve requirements have been analyzec1. A classification into
the following four functions of minimum reserves has emerged in this literature as a rough
consensus:
1. Reserve requirements can ensure that there is a certain structural demand for central
bank reserves. In the case of an unstable or even vanishing demand for central bank
money, the central bank can thus guarantee the exist.ence and rough stability of this
demand.
2. Unremunerated reserve requirements are also a sort of tax on the crea,tion of deposit
money by commercial banks. This tax may be efficient from the point of view of the
theory of optimal taxation or it may be perceived as a 'fair' price for some central
bank services for the private banking sector.
:3. By raising the banks' costs of creating deposit money, unremunerated reserve requi
rements may stabilize the monetary sector of the economy and thereby reduce the
impact of monetary shocks on real economic activity. The increase of the interest
rate elasticity of the demand for money is often cited as the most important element
of this stabilization effect.
4. Areserve requirement that has to be fulfilled only as an average within a certain
reserve maintellance period enhances the flexibility of banks in their money mana
gement and contributes to the smoothing of short-term interest rates, as transitory
liquidity shocks are mapped into interest rate variations in a cushioned way.
As often as these functions have been affirmed, they have also been questioned many
times.4 Especia.lly private banks who are subject to reserve requirements and who have

to compete with foreign banks that are not have criticized reserve requirements for a
long time. For example, the Bundesverband deutscher Banken [1996, 20] concludes in a
study on the desirable instruments of the European Central Bank that minimum reserve
requirements are neither necessary for an effieient monetary poliey nor for money market
management anel thus should not be used in stage three of the European Monetary Union.
The crucial question in the current debate on minimum reserve requirements is probably
whether the functions 3 and 4 mentioned above are really relevant or not. Both pretend
that (constant) minimum reserve requirements can contribute to economic stabilization.
Tlwy can be analyzed to a large extent separately: function 3 is tied to the incompleteness
of remuneration and the size of the reserve requirement. It is independent of any averaging
provision. Fundion 4 is dependent on averaging yet independent of the remuneration of
required reserves, and it is even independent of the size of the reserve requirement as the
banks' capacity to build up temporary balances at their central bank accounts can be
chosen regardless of the size of the reserve requirement.
In this paper, I have attempted to base my analysis as much as possible on an 'incomplete
information' approach. Economic reality differs from textbook neoclassical models in so
far as in the real world coordination problems resulting from incomplete information have
far-reaching economic consequences. Money itself is an institution which would have no
relevance in the neoclassical world of perfect information and zero transaction costs. It.
is added to the real economy as a veil, or in other words, there is a perfect diehotomy
between the real and the monetary 'seetor'. This implies that any true mierofoundation
of the t.heory of money (which may be classified into the theory of monetary order and the
theory of monet.ary poliey) must be founded on thc economics of incomplete information
(or on the economics of 'transaetion costs').
Hayek [1945, 519] was the first author t.o stress the fundamental role played by incomplete
information in thc analysis of economic order:
"VVhat is the problem we try to solve when we try to construct. a rational ecollomic order? ..
Th/? peculiar cllaracter of the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely
by the fact. that knowledgl" of t1lP circumstances of which we mllst make use never exists in
cOllcent.rated or integrated form, but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently
coutradictory knowledge which all the separate individllals possess."
The monetary order of an ecollomy is one aspect of its general orgallizat.ion. Thus,
aceording t.o Hayek, a genuine analysis of the problem of designing a mOlletary order
must. a.s alrea.dy remarked, he founded on the analytics of ineomplete information. This
2 

natura.lly inclueles the question of whether or not rmmmum reserve requirements are
belleficial and whether or not an averaging option should be granted 1,0 banks concerning
t.heir reserve fulfillment.5
The objective of a central bank should be to provide a monetary system mlmmlzmg
transaction costs in the real economy (by provieling a medium of exchange, a store of
value, and a unit of account) and which, at the same time, is not itself a source of
destabilization anel macroeconomic coordination failure. The central bank's instruments
for achieving this purpose can be grouped into two categories, namely: (1) the design of
the monetary order and (2) the design of areaction function (a function which maps any
observation by the central bank of the state of the economy into a monetary policy). There
should exist Olle simultaneous specification of both groups of instruments which minimizes
the macroeconomic coordination failure generated by instabilities of the monetary sector
and which thereby maximizes economic welfare.
But why should it not suffice to choose an adequate reaction function in order to achieve
optimum stability? \Vhy shoulel the monetary order as weIl be relevant for stabilization?
It is again Hayek [1945. 524J (a committed opponent of the idea of a centrally pla,nned
emnomy) who gives the genera.l answer to this question by stressing the fundamental
relationship between the dispersion of information and the necessity of a decentralization
of fconomic decision taking:
"If we agrf'e that. thc economic problem of societ.y is mainly one of rapid adaptat.ion to
rhangf's in t,he part.icular circul11st.ances of time and place, it would seem to follow that the
ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who
kllOW dirf'ctly of the relevant. changes and of the resourees immediately available to meet
them... We must solve it by some form of deeent,ralization."
The claim of the idiosyncratic relevancy of the monetary order for macroeconomic stability
is related to this insight. If all information on the (monetary) state of the economy were
concentrated at the centra.l bank, stabilization policy could probably be reduced to the
choke of an optimal reaction function. But if information about monetary conditions
18 dispersed among many a.gents, one should expect that the stability behavior of the
SThe eritique of any microfoundat.ion of the theory of monetary poliey and of monetary order that
is not based Oll some ineomplete and asymmetrie information setting is in a sense similar to that of
Coase [1960] eoncerning welfare economics. Coase showed that traditional welfare eeonomies is built on
shaky ground as it analyzes phenomena such as externalities and monopolist.ic priee setting in a zero
transartion-cost, (or eomplete information) framework, despite the fact that those types of eoordination
failure ean be explained only with transaction costs (or incomplete information).

economy cannot be analyzed without looking at the monetary order and the way ill
which it shapes the disclosure of private information and its aggregation a,nd transmission
info financial prices and quantities.
The discussion of bot.h stabiliza,tion aspects of reserve requirements will in thi8 sense illu
strate that (1) the stahilization of the real sedor of the economy hy shaping the monetary
order has to be a.nalyzed in the framework of an incomplete information approach and
tbat. (2) a dispersion of information is a necessary condition for the idiosyncratic influ
ellce of the monetary order (beyond the central bank's reaction funetion) for economic
stabiliza.tion.
In tlw rest of the paper we proceed as follows: In seetion 11, two aspects of minimum
reserve requiremcnts that arf' not of an informational economic nature in thc narrow
semw will be briefly rf'viewed. First, thc quest.ion of whether or not minimum reserve
requirements are lleeded in order to create a structural demand for centra} bank mOlley
is analyzed; secondly, it, is examined what can be said about the efficiency of minimum
reserve requirements from the point of view of the theory of optimal taxation (function
2). In sections III and IV, both stabilizing functions of (consta.nt) minimum reserve
requirements are discussed using approaches founded as far as possible on an incomplete
information setting. Section 111 primarily reviews and classifies the literature about the
stabilizing impact of the non-remuneration of minimum reserve requirements (regardless
of averaging provisions). Section IV ana.lyzes in t,he framework of a signal extrartion
model t.he implications of the granting of an averaging provision, regardless of t.he size amI
remunerat.ion of the required reserves. In both sections III and IV, the crucial question
is whf'ther t,he reviewed instit.utional arrangements can enhance the information flOWR
het.ween tlw centra.l bank. private banks and the genera.! public and if they can t.h11S
cont.ribut.e to a reduct.ion of macroeconomic coordination failure in the form of fluct.ua.tiom;
of emnomic act.ivity originating in shocks in the monetary sedor. In Section V, a summary
of t.he results is given and some conclusions are drawn.

11. Short review of two functions of reserve requirements which are not related
directly to a problem of incomplete information
In this section, we briefly review two aspeets of minimum reserve requirements which
cannot be interpreted directly as being related to some 'built-in stabilizing' effeet due to
the dispersion of information between the central bank and the private banking seetor.
11.1 Creating an artificial structural demand for central bank money
In the oider literature justifying reserve requirements, it was sometimes claimed that only
such requirements would ensure that the creation of deposit money by private banks did
not lead to an infinite monetary expansion and thus an undetermined price leveL6 The
critical assumption far deriving this result is that currency and deposit money are perfeet
substitutes. This can be easily illustrated in the framework of the theory of the money
multiplier (between the monetary base and, for example, MI): if the ratio of currency
to transaetion deposits is not well-defined and thus possibly zero (because of the perfect
substitutability of both categories of MI), then the money multiplier will be undefined 01'
even infinite (if thc voluntary reserve holdings of the banking seetor are zero). Then, a
positive minimum reserve requirement limits the expansion of MI and thus is a necessary
condition for the existence of a finite price level.
In the present real world, deposits and currency are not perfeet substitutes. If riIoney
holders have weIl defined preferences for different components of MI, banks will not be
ahle to create an arbitrary quantity of deposit money, as their customers will transform
apart of the bank money into currency. Even if banks hold no reserves at all, MI will be
well-defined and finite for any quantity of central bank money.
But this present stability is no guarantee that innovations in the private money supply
will not introduce in the near future a greater instability of the money multiplier and, in
the medium term, a far-reaching decline in the demand for central bank money.7 These
6See for example Richt.er [1990. 327-331] for an overview of t.he oider literature. The question of
whether minimum reserve requirements are necessary is already discussed extensively for example by
Keynes [1930] and Lutz [1936/1962]. Keynes [1930, I, 23-33) eloes not agree that banks could create
any quantity of deposit. money. hut he nevertheless advocates the introduction of a minimum reserve
requirement in Great Britain: "These regulations would greatly strengthen the power of control in the
hands of lohe Bank of England placing, indeed. in its hands an almost complete cOlltrol over the volume of
bank-money without in any way hampering the legitimate operations of the joint stock banks." (Keynes
[1930, 11, 77)). He also suggests that the reserve ratio should be variable and adjusted as a function of
monet.ary conditions (Keynes [1930.11,261]).
'Fama [1980] allalyzes the relevance of minimum reserve requirements in a. futuristic, currency-free
Â·5

prospects are a strong argument in favor of generally keeping the minimum reserve instru
ment, even if, for other reasons, the reserve ratios would be reduced to zero for the time
being. A raising of the reserve ratio in response to a substantial shrinking of the demand
for central bank money would guarantee at least the rough stability of the monetary sy
stem. The private economic agents' knowledge of the fact that the centra.l bank has a
powerful instrument in its hand to guarantee a chosen scarcity of central bank money
stabilizes expectations and secures the confidence of the markets in the monetary order,
which is a crucial condition for the effident work of any modern exchange economy.
How can the function of minimum reserves reviewed in this section be exactly separated
from the one reviewed in section III? The potential shock assumed here (the shrinking of
the natural demand for central bank money) is permanent and not transitory as the shocks
in section III, where a eonstant reserve requirement is seen as a so-called built-in stabilizer.
Another difference is that here it is ultimatively irrelevant what kind of good is subjeet
to reserve requirements. In section III, it is decisive that certain kinds of bank deposits
are subject to the reserve reqnirement. A third differenee is that the function of reserve
requirements discussed in this section can become a necessary condition for maintaining
central bank money as the nurruiraire of the economy, whereby the function discussed in
seetion III never becomes really fundamental for the preservation of the monetary order.
II.2. Allocative implications of the taxation effect of reserve requirements
Unremunerated or only partia.lly remunerated reserve requirements are also a kind of
tax on the bank deposits that are subject to the reserve requirement and are a souree
of income to the central bank. In general, taxes are related to some form of allocative
distortions and related welfare losses.
A number of papers analyze in a rather abstract form the alloeative effects of the taxation
component of reserve requirements in the context of models of overlapping generations
(Romer (1985], Sargent and Wallace [1985], Freeman (1987], Mourmouras und Russel
[1992], Freeman und Haslag [1995]; Davis und Thoma [1995]8). A related aspect is re
economy. If in such a. context, the central bank defines some good as the mImeraire for which no natural
demand exists, then areserve requirement would be a necessary condition for having weil defined prices
expresssed in this numeraire. However, the best long-term solution in such a case would be to choose auy
real good as t.he numeraire for which scarcity is weIl defined without the creation of an artificial demand.
For example, Browne (1996] analyzes concretely the current and expected innovations in the demand for
currency and in payment. systems and their implications for monetary stabilit.y.
BAll t.hese models are deterministic, such t.hat potent.ial benefits from reserve requirements related to
their impact on information flows are not. analyzed in their framework. Romer (1985] points out t.hat
6 

viewed by Baltensperger [1982b]: he thinks that the taxation effect of reserve requirements
compensates for another distortion, namely the one implied by the non-remuneration of
currency which is a substitute for deposit money. The non-remuneration of compulsory
reserves would then neutralize the distortion by rendering currency relatively more attrac
tive compared to deposit money.
Ultimately, one has to ask whether the tax effect of a non-remunerated reserve represents
an optimal tax according to the theory of optimal taxation, whieh postulates the optima
lity condition that thc marginal welfare eost of a11 kinds of tax income should be equa1.
Thus, the releva.nt question in the ease of the central bank's (or the sta.te's) ineome from
reserve requirements Is whether the marginal welfare eost (considering a11 benefits and
distortions ) equals the marginal welfare costs of other forms of taxes. Let us assume that
thc relevance of function 3 of minimum reserve requirements (discussed in the next see
tion) can be neglected. Then the justification for the non-remuneration of reserves rests
exelnsively on taxation aspects, as function 1 and 4 are independent of remuneration.
In the case of open capital markets (and stable exchange rates), the international mo
bility of at least apart of deposits is relatively high, such that sman differenees in the
tax on deposits (implicit in the reserve requirement) imply large outfiows of certain types
of deposits. The sensitivity of the tax basis regarding the size of the tax is thus rather
high. In such a context, it is not efficient to tax the concerned deposits and it should
be expected that thc (national) marginal welfare eost of income generated by those unre
munerated reserves is higher than the one of other forms of public income. 1'0 avoid the
relat.ed inefficieneies. required reserves on the sensitive types of bank liabilities could be
remunerated or the coneerned reserve ra,tios could be reduced.9
reserve requirements are not exa.ctly eqllivalent to a tax on deposits. He derives an optimal combination of
public im'ome from monet.ary expansion, minimum reserve requirements and debt expansion. Sargent and
Wallace [198.'i] analyze the implications of paying interest. on required reserves and reach the conclusion
t.hat. sueh an arrangement. would imply a continuum of equilibria. This result seems to be related to the
assumpt.ion timt all forms of money are perfect substitut.es. Mourmouras and Russe! [1992] analyze under
whieh conditions an unremunerated minimum reserve and a deposit taxation ar~' 'broadly equivalent'.
Freeman and lIaslag [199.'5J claim that the distortionary effects of reserve requirements are always larger
than those of normal taxes.
"Remsperger and Angenendt [1995, 401-403] consider three kinds of distortions implied by minimum
reserves: internat.ional dist.ortions between different financial centers; dist.ortions bet.wcen financial inter
mediaries that are subject to reserve reqllirements and those whieh are not (or between deposits whieh are
sllbject. t.o reserve requirements and deposits whieh are not); disl,ort.ions between different kinds of banks
which differ for example in t.he amount of free reserves they would hold without any reserve requirement.
The second type of distortions implies t.hat there should be a permanent observation of whether substi
tutes for deposits su bject to reserve requirement.s a.re created by banks 1.0 eireumvent. reserve regulations.
7 

An alternative to the adjustment of a countries tax implicit in reserve requirements for
the reasons mentioned naturally consists in an adequate adaptation of the reserve requi
rements in the other countries of the region of high mobility of deposits. The crucial point
is that the implicit taxes on the more mobile types of deposits should be harmonized. In
the case of such a harmonization, the sensitivity of the tax base (the volume of deposits)
regarding the reserve ratio would be much lower and it would be difficult to prove that the
marginal welfare cost of public income induced by a low reserve requirement on deposits
is higher than the welfare costs of other types of tax income.
The emergence of such substit,utes raises the marginal welfare costs of the reserve l'equirement tax and
should eventually be prevented by some regulat.ory or legal action.
8 

III. U nremunerated constant reserve requirements as a tool of macroeconomic
stabilization (regardless of averaging provisions)
In this section, we review the problem of minimizing the impact of stochastic exogenous
shocks on endogenous goal variables in the framework of Poole's [1970] method. In the
basic specification, it is assumed that the reduced form of the macroeconomy can be
represented by the following system:10
(1)
where ;Tt E Rn is a vector of stationary economic variables (i.e. GDP growth, inflation,
money supply growth, interest rates, etc), ;1:0 E Rn is the vector of natural or goal values,
tt E Rm 1S a vector of exogenous shocks which do not affect the natural (or goal) values
of the endogenous variables and which are not anticipated by the central bank. The ex
pected values of the elements of tt are zero and the variance-covariance matrix of tt is
known. The matrix A E Rn*m describes the relationship between exogenous shocks and
the endogenous variables. The central bank can influence the matrix A with its parame
ters<p (<Pb <Pz, ...,<Pk)' Those parameters can be divided into the two subcategories of
instruments: (1) monetary order parameters (as the size and remuneration of minimum
reserves), (2) parameters of thc rcaction function of the ccntral bank (as the interest rate
elast.icity of money supply). Let the central bank have a quadratic utility function:
n
~Vt = -
L Oi(Xti XOi)Z (2)
i=l
The Oj represent. the weights of the endogenous variables in the central bank's utility
fUllction. The central bank determines the values of the parameters <P to maximize the
expeded value of this function (corresponding to a minimization of a weighted sum of the
variances of the endogenous variables).
Only one part of the literature presented in this section explicitly analyzes the stabilization
effect of reserve requirements. The other part looks at the choice of the reaction function
and the central bank's instrument. But in both cases, the ultimate questioll is the Olle of
shaping the matrix A in the reduced form (1). In fact, it does not make sense to have
two parallel stabilization theories (one for the monetary order parameters and one for the
readion function) as both are closely interrelated.
10 A variant of this model where the eoefficients themselves are stochastic has also been discussed in
the literature (Brainard [1967J, Turnovsky [1975], Turnovsky [1977], Canzoneri [1979]). We will not
eonsider this slightly more complex variant here. Another interesting extension of the model is the one
hy Kareken, Muench and Wallace [1973J and LeHoy and Waud [1977J. In these papers, the problem of
signal extrartion is int.roduced in a multiperiod specification of the stabilization model.
9 

In the following, we give a short survey of parts of the related stabilization literature. The
contributions are grouped into four categories. In a fifth section, we contribute another
variant of the stabilization model illustrating the relevance of the dispersion of information
for the significance of employing minimum reserves as an instrument of stabilization.
1. Kaminow [1977], Laufenberg [1979], Froyen and Kopecky [1983], Van Hoose [1986],
Weiner [1992] and Brunner and Lown [1993a], [1993b] analyze the stabilization impact
of minimum reserves on intermediate targets as monetary aggregates or inte
rest rates. 11 The general conclusion of those papers is that the size and remuneration
of reserve requirements is relevant for monetary stabilization which implies that reserve
requirements are in principle useful to stabilize the monetary sector. However, none of
t.he papers really shows that the destabilization induced by a lowering of reserve require
ments from a low level (as for example the one prevailing in the US or Germany for the
present) to zero would be substantial. On the contrary, Brunner and Lown [1993a, 204],
who estimate their model, come to the following conclusion: "[O]ur work... suggests that
lower reservf' requirements are unlikely to have much impact on volatility in the reserve
market. Although there may be other reasons for maintaining a certain level of reserve
requirements, a significant increase in volatility of reserves and the funds rate does not
appear to be one of them."
A general problem of this approach is that it is not well-motivated to focus on the stahili
zation of intermediate targets and not of final ones. It is assumed implicitly that both are
equivalent, which is not necessarily true. I2 To criticize this assumption does not imply
Cl. critique of looking at intermf'diate targets as monetary aggregates at all. This may
still be the best way to assure credibility and the ultimate goal of a low inflation rate.
The point is that the stabilization of monetary aggregates by reserve requirements may
theoretica.lly end up raising the volatility of the real sector.
The rest of the literature reviewed here analyzes the stabilization impa.ct of policy para.
meters on the final goal variables of price level and GDP.
11 In the framework of models which are more differentiated in the time dimension, Kopecky [1988] and
Lasser [1992] analyze the relative impacts on the stability of monetary aggregat.es of a lagged reserve
accounting, a contemporaneous reserve accounting and an 'ahnost contemporaneous' reserve accounting.
Polleit [1996] analyzes the relevance of a differentiation of reserve ratios with regard to different kinds of
bank deposits on the stabilization of different monetary aggregates with reserve requirements.
12Canzoneri [1977] stresses this point. Siegel [1981, 1073], Baltensperger [1982a, 206] and the Bun
desverband deutscher Banken [1996, 19] criticize the stabilization of intermediate targets in the case of
minimum reserves.
10 

2. Richter [1968J was the first author to analyze the role of minimum reserves as a
macroeconomic built-in stabilizer in a comparative-static setting.13 He coneludes that
the stahilization effect. of reserve requirements ultimately depends on the coefficients of
the model, but that the case in which minimum reserve requirements a,ct as a "built-in
destabilizer" is "by far the more plausible" (Richter [1968, 288]).
Siegel [1981J and Baltensperger [1982aJ show in their models that the variability of the
monetary aggregate is minimized by a 100% reserve ratio. But the reserve ratio mi
nimizing the variability of the pr'ice level depends on the coefficients of the model and
the correlation structure of the shocks. It can take any value between zero and one.
Ba1tensperger [1982a, 214] remains agnostic in his conelusions: "The fractional reserve
system has a fiexibility and elasticity that may be a disadvantage in some situations, but
that may equally be an advantage in other situations. I conelude that it is difficult and
probably not advisable to choose between a low and a high reserve requirement on the
basis of this kind of stability considerations."
Siegel [1981] is more courageous and estimates his model for the US with quarterly data
from between 1952 and 197:3. He coneludes that the optimal average reserve requirement
would have been 7% instead of the actual 11.5%. On the other side, the difference in the
standa.rd deviation of the quarterly price level would only have been minor. For reserve
ratios of 7%, 11..5% and 0%, the standard deviation would have been 0.452%, 0.485% and
about 0.5% respectively. Thus, the consequence of a reduction of the reserve ratio from
a high level (compared to the present one in Germany) to zero would have been rather
mmor.
3. The weIl known model of Poole [1970] focuses on the question of the optimal monetary
instrument (a monetary aggregate, an interest rate or an intermediate solution) in a
stochastic IS-LM model, without explicitly considering minimum reserves. He is one
of the first authors to stress the relevance of the incompleteness of information for such
problems: "The choice of instruments problem is elearly a consequence of uncertainty, and
analysis of the problem requires a stochastic model" (Pooie [1970, 214]). The stochastic
IS-LM model contains the following two equations:
(3)
(4)
where Y is the GDP, M is a monetary aggregate, r is the interest rate, ao, al, bOl b1, b2
13Reserve requirements influence the multipliers of Richter's model, which is not explicitly stochastic,
but which ('an be easily interpreted as such if the exogeneous variables are seen as random variables.
11 

are coefficients with al < 0, b1
> 0, b2
> 0. The random variables /1, v both have an
expected value of zero, variances (j~, (j~, and a covariance (j11M"
The realizations of these
random variables take place such that the central bank is not able to react by adjusting
its instruments.The model has two equations and three variables (y, M, r). The central
bank chooses between fixing M, r or the parameters Mo, h in the linear money supply
function
M = Mo + hr (5)
In a deterministic framework (a framework of complete information) where (j~ = (j~ = 0,
it is irrelevant which instrument the central bank chooses. Any intended (natural) value
of Y can be realized with any instrument.
This is no longer true in the case of uncertainty. With a combined policy (5) (which
includes the cases of a pure monetary and pure interest rate instrument as special cases),
we obtain thf' following reducf'd form for Y:
ao(b2 - h) + alMo b2 - h al
Y= - /1+ V
(6)
b2
+ al bl - h b2
+ al bl - h b2
+ al bl - h
The policy parameters hand Mo are now relevant for the level and the variance of Y and
thus for the expected value of the central bank's utility function. The central bank should
set h at a level where it minimizes the destabilizing influence of the exogenous shocks,
and in a second step it should choose 1\,/0 such that it obtains the preferred expected value
of Y.
How is Poole's observation related to the stabilization effect of minimum reserve requi
rements? In the papers by Richter [1968], Siegel [1981], and Baltensperger [1982a], the
central bank uses the minimum reserve ratio instead of Poole's interest elasticity of money
supply (h) to stabilize the economy. Both approaches can and indeed must be unified in
one model. A separate analysis of the stabilization impact of the centrals bank's money
supply function on the one hand and built-in stabilizers as minimum reserves on the other
is not useful as the impacts of both types of policy parameters are interdependent. In
addition, we are interested in the question of whether there are 'redundancies' in the sense
that the central bank does not need as many policy parameters as available to achieve
the highest possible stability. If some stabilization policies imply certain welfare losses
(independently of the stabilization problem), a redundancy should be noted as it implies
that the best stabilization result can be obtained without using the instrument(s) with
bad properties. This is the insight of Horrigan [1988].
4. Horrigan [1988] shows in the framework of a macroeconomic model with rational
expectations that the size and remuneration of required reserves are irrelevant from the
12 

point of view of stabilization of the price level and economic activity, as the impact of
reserve reqnirements can also be obtained by an adequate adjustment of the interest rate
elasticity of the money supply. He is the first author to explicitly merge the minimum
reserve literature ala Baltensperger [1982aJ with the general stabilization literature ala
Poole [1970J.
The redundancy hypothesis ean be easily il1ustrated in the framework of an augmented
model of Poole [1970J (Horrigan's model is slightly more eomplicated in its representation).
A fixed money multiplier is introduced into the model and the supply of eentral bank
money is modelled similarly to the money supply in the original model. Suppose that
the relevant monetary aggregate M 1S related to the quanitiy of eentral bank money
Z = Z~ +gr by:
lvI = k(Z~ +gr), (7)
where k is the money multiplier whieh ean be determined by the eentral bank via the
minimum reserve ratio. The eentral bank now has three poliey parameters, but the
redundancy of one of them i8 obvious. Any money supply function ~o/Is = .0/10
+hr ean
be implemented for any value of k by choosing adequately the values of Z~, g. Minimum
reserve requirements a.re thus not necessary in this framework and shollid not be used for
reasons of simplicity (evenif minimum reserves do not imply any special welfare losses).
The redundaney re:mlt of Horrigan [1988] thus includes this simple fixed money multiplier
variant of the Poole model.
But how robust is this result? Are minimum reserves redundant in any reasonable model
of the economy? It is easy to show that this is not the case. By small modifications of the
model of Horrigan (including the introduetion of additional noise terms), the redundaney
result breaks down. Again, this ean be easily illustrated in Poole's [1970] elementary
setting by augmenting equations (3) and (4) by the following one:
A1 = k(Z~ +gr +(), (8)
where ( is an additional random variable with E(C) = 0, a varianee (J'~, and eovarianees
(J'tf.L' (J'Zv' The redueed form for Y now becomes
Again, the central bank minimizes the varianee of }r by choosing k and 9 and then sets
Z~ such that E(Y) = Y"'. The eoeffieient of ( in (9) reveals that there is HO longer any
redundaney in the parameters of the central bank. All three are needed to obtain the
optimal stabilization around a prefered expected value of Y.
13
In general one should expect that if the modelling of the economy is suffieiently eomplex
and if suffieiently many exogenous shocks are included, then it beeomes very unlikely
that minimum reserves and the interest rate elasticity of the eentral bank's money supply
are eompletely redundant. This is espeeially plausible if one eonsiders that different
subjects in the eeonomy should have different information about the state of the eeonomy
(which is relevant for their optimization behavior). IL for example, the banks have private
information about the monetary state of the eeonomy, this should be a sufficient reason
to make reserve requirements non-redundant as they shape ineentives of a category of
economie agents whieh have relevant information the central bank does not have.
Horrigan's [1988] contribution consists more in having demonstrated that the impact of
minimum reserves on macroeconomie stability cannot be seen independently of other
policy parameters of the central bank and that the question of the neeessity of minimum
reserve requirement has to be analyzed in eonjunction with all other availahle monetary
policy instruments. The redundaney result itself is probably not correct in a complex
world. But that does not prove the necessity of minimum reserves as the insight on the
theoretical relevanee of reserve requirements for stability is only a first and relatively
minor step towards the claim that a certain minimum reserve requirement is optimal for
a certain conerete economy.
5. Now an additional version of Poole's [1970] model is presented illustrating how the
dispersion of information between the central bank and the private banking sector can be
seen a.., the crueial dimension of the redundaney question. This time equations (3) and
(4) are eompleted by:
(10)
(11)
The terms /iN and /ic represent the ex ante expectations of the realization of the monetary
shock 1/ by t.he eentral bank and the private banking sedor, respectively. It is assumed
for hoth that the money market shock is relevant for their optimizing behavior. This
implies that the degree of anticipation of shoeks must playa role for the stability of the
macroeconomic system. Equation (10) represents the supply of central bank money by
the central bank. It is assumed that the central bank observes ex ante
(12)
where (N is a noise variable with an expected value of zero and a variance (J'~,N' The
parameter Cl is another policy parameter of the central bank. By choosing Cl, the central
bank decides on the relevance of prior information about the shock for its monetary
14 

policy. Equation (11) represents the creation of money by the private banking sector. It
is assumed that the private banks observe a variable
VG = V
+(G (13)
where (G is another noise term with an expected value of zero and a variance O'Z,G' The
random variables (G and (N are assumed to be uncorrelated. If we assurne that C2 =f. 0,
then the money market shock is indeed relevant for the private banks' money supply.
The central bank now has Jour policy parameters to achieve its goals, namely g, k, Cl and
Z~. But how many parameters does the centra.l bank really need for the stabilization of
Y'? The reduced form of Y now takes the following form:
Y = ao(b2 - kg) +alkZ~ + al
+ kCI +kC2 1
b2
+blal - kg b2+blal - kg b2 +blal kg
kCI kC2
+ + (14)
b2
+blal - kg bz +blal kg
There are now four random variables influencing Y. In table 1, we distinguish mne
combinations of ex ante knowledge of the central bank and private banks. For both, three
cases ean be distinguished, namely perfect anticipation of v (O'Z,G 0; O'Z.N 0), partial
anticipation of v (O'Z,G > 0 and finite; O'Z,N > 0 and finite), and no prior information on
1/ (O'Z,G -7 00, O'Z,N -7
(0). Let us assume that Z8 is always used after the determination
of the other parameters to implement the optimal value of E(Y). Of the remaining three
parameters two or three are necessary, depending on the information dispersion:

Minimum reserves are non-redundant in the combina,tions with a star '*'. Thus, the
dispersion of information is a. crucial dimension for the question of whether minimum
reserves are redundant or not. Since the interactions between economic variables are very
complex in the real worId and knowledge about monetary conditions is widely dispersed,
we should expect that minimum reserves and the interest rate elasticity of the reserve
supply are ultimately not redundant.
Conclusion of Section III: In the real worId, non-remunerated required reserves have
a spe6fic influence on macroeconomic stability and especially on the variability of real
15 

economic activity around its natural level. The redundancy result of Horrigan [1988] is a
special case, which is especially unlikely in the case of differences between the knowledge
of banks and the knowledge of the central bank about the monetary state of the economy.
As such differences certainly exist in reality, the minimum reserve instrument is in principle
effective for stabilization purposes. The precise stabilization impact of reserve require
ments depends on the size of the requirement. A wrong positive reserve ratio can lead to
less stability than a reserve ratio of zero. The best reserve ratio from the point of view
of stabilization depends on the economic structure, the information dispersion among the
different economic agents and the variance-covariance structure of the exogenous shocks.
The empirical implementation of this insight in the form of an estimation of the optimum
mimimum reserve ratio has not been realized up to now in a convincing way. Moreover,
according to the few empirical contributions which have been made so far, the estimated
impact of low reserve requirements on economic stability is rather smalI.
16 

IV. A veraging provisions and the information content of money market rates
IV.1 Some preliminary welfare economic remarks on the decentralization of
monetary decision rights
The granting of averaging provisions m the fulfillment of reserve requirements to the
private banks has been advocated in the literature as a means of smoothing short term
interest rates (Pooie [1968], Laufenberg [1979], Baltensperger [1980], Spindt and Tarhan
[1984], Angeloni and Prati [1992], Feinman [1993], Vazquez [1995], Davies [1997]). The
smoothing effect of reserve requirements with averaging provisions results from the fact
that the banks can use the additional reserves for intertemporal arbitrage in refinancing.
Finally, the intertemporal arbitrage activity of the whole banking sector implies that the
interest rate effects of all anticipated temporary liquidity shocks are smoothed away.
Unfortunately, the literature does not explain the informational and real sector conse
quences of the smoothing of money market interest rates. This deficit has been detec
ted by opponents of minimum reserve requirements. For example, the Bundesverband
deutscher Banken [1996, 19] explicitly denies that more erratic money market rates in
Germany (due to an abolishment of reserve requirements) would do any damage to the
real economy.
Why should the smoothness of short term interest rates be an objective of the design of
the monetary order? In answering this question, it is important to note that the central
bank could always achieve a complete smoothing of interest rates by an infinite interest
rate elasticity of money supply at a certain interest rate (which would be modified from
time to time when the central bank would have received any news about the optimal
interest rate for achieving its final goals). Such a supply function could be implemented
by two standing facilities, a deposit facility and a lending facility offering and charging the
same interest rate, respectively. The fact that central banks generally do not implement
such a system shows that centra.l banks do not really want to smooth a. tout prix. They
prefer certain market developments to be reflected in interest rate movements. What
kind of developments does the central bank want to be smoothed out and what kind
of developments does it want reflected in interest rates? Does an averaging provision
smoothes out the 'bad' fluctuations and does it conserve the 'good' ones?
In this section the smoothing argument will be further developed to be able to answer such
questions. In the framework of a simple signal extraction model, this section will illustrate
that an averaging option may facilitate, for private market observers on the one hand and
17 

for the central bank on the other hand, improved extraction of the permanent component
in the money market intel'est rate and thus enhance the aggregation of a certain type of
dispersed information into prices according to Hayek [1945]. In this sense, an averaging
provision can be seen as a decentralization of monetary decision rights reflecting the
dispersion of knowledge about monetary conditions.
In traditional welfare economics, the regulation of a market (or a pigou tax or subsidy)
has to be motivated by some externality. Which externality at the money market could
motivate a regulation of banks' liquidity cushions (such as, for example, a minimum
requirement)? Why shouldn't the cushions banks hold voluntarily be optimal from the
point of view of society? In answering this question, one should be aware of the fact
that money is a natural monopoly good because its consumption has positive network
externalityeffects. The provision of natural monopoly goods is a public task or has to be
at least regulated by the state. In the design of the monetary order, one therefore does not
have anyway a classical market situation as the reference point of a regulatory analysis
(Hayek [1976] denies this point by claiming that a private provision of money should be
efficient). It thus does not make any sense to criticize minimum reserve requirements for
being a regulation not in conformity with the principles of a market economy as it has
sometimes been done by opponents of reserve requirements. On the other side, the lack
of a pure market reference does not rule out a comparative welfare analysis. The welfare
implications of two alternative regulations of the monetary order can always be compared.
This remark in mind, it is suggested hen" that the granting of an averaging provision can
be interpreted as fo11ows: the holding of liquidity cushions implies opportunity costs in
the form of interest rates for the banks. In deciding about the size of liquidity cushions,
ballks compare their private marginal benefit to their private marginal costs. But beside
the private returns of liquidity cushions, these ha.ve an important positive externality,
as they enhance the information content of money market rates concerning the longer
term prospects of monetary and real interest rate conditions which are a basic variable
for a11 intertemporal investment decisions of the economy.14 Because of this positive
externality, the cushions chosen by banks would be too small from the point of view of
society. A subsidization of cushions or a prescription of cushions in the form of reserve
requirements (with averaging) both influence the effective quantity of liquidity reserves.
The additional capacity of intertemporal arbitrage in refinancing i8 the crucial element of
averaging provisions. In general, it is not relevant whether the compulsory reserves are
14See Hirshleifer [1971] and Grossman and Stiglitz [1976] for a general analysis of t.he welfare a:,pects
of t.he production and aggregation of information.
18
remunerated or not and whether the averaging capacities are created by a positive reserve
requirement or by permitting the banks temporary overnight overdrafts as in the Bank of
Canada's system of 'averaging around zero'. (Still another possibility to internalize the
positive externalities of liquidity cushions would be to pay an interest rate on voluntary
reserves. )
The choice of those details has some distributional implications. It can also have allocative
implications if the banks ca,n consider the costs of the regulation in some prior decision
illfluencing the burden of the regulation, as for example in the case of an unremunerated
reserve requirement when the banks can transfer deposits subject to reserve requirements
abroad.
Another welfare eifect of the smoothing of interest rates should be briefly mentioned:
For money users, transitory scarcity shocks are relevant in so far as they imply that the
marginal costs of borrowing money fluctuate. It is plausible under various settings that a
constant interest rate corresponding to the average of fluctuating interest rates is better
in welfare terms for money users than fluctuating rates. If banks have any information
about the permanent/transitory decomposition of shocks the central bank does not have,
then the banks' liquidity cushions implied by minimum reserves with averaging help to
smooth the ma.rginal costs of borrowing money and thereby raises welfare. This benefit of
smoothing could be realized by standing facilities which would guarantee a fixed interest
rat.e (which i8 not true for the signal extraction argument).
IV.2 The idea of a small signal extraction model
In the framework of a two period model, the 'informational efficiency of t.he money market'
(which is defined here as the information content of the money market interest rate with
respect to its permanent component) will be analyzed for the case of no averaging and the
case of an averaging provision with an averaging length of two periods. Three independent
shocks occur on the money market: two transitory shocks relevant only in the first and
second period respectively and a permanent shock relevant in both periods and further on.
None of the shocks is correlated with any other. The transitory shocks are viewed as short
term liquidity shocks for which the interest rate is not relevant. Such liquidity shocks may
occur at special transaction dates (as for example tax payment dates), at special currency
withdrawal dates (as for example in Germany on Saturdays in December), in connection
with very large single transactions, etc. The permanent shock can be interpreted as a
variable refiecting the monetary policy stance of the central bank and/or as a variable
reflecting structural development.s on the side of money users, as changes in the domestic
19 

use of currency, changes m the currency demand of foreigners, innovations in payment
systems, etc.
Different interpretations of the model can be given concerning the information flows on
the money market. We distinguish three groups of agents: banks participating in the
money market, market observers (a11 other private agents for which the interest rate is
relevant) and the centra.l bank. None of the agents has to have prior ,information about
the permanent shock but it is assumed that the central bank and the private banking
sector both have specific ex ante knowledge about thc transitory shocks affecting thc
money market. It could be assumed, for example, that the transitory shocks are the sum
of one trallsitory shock anticipated exclusively by the central bank and one anticipated
exclusively by the private banking sector. For reasons of simplicity, we assume that the
component of transitory shocks that is anticipated by the central bank is automatica11y
neut.ralized by it, so that. we can concentrate on thc transitory shocks about which the
private banks ha.ve some private aclvance information and the central bank does not.
Only in the case where the private banking sector had no specific advance information
about transitory shocks at a11 would the argument of the model break down. In this
unrealistic case, it would be :mfficient to have the central bank smooth away a11 transitory
shocks, 01' speaking in Hayek's [1945] vocabulary, as the1'e would be no real dispersion of
knowledge, no decentralization of decision 1'ights would be necessary.15
In the choice of an order of t.he money market, one important goal should be to maximize
the informational efficiency of the market in the sense of the information content of the
interest rate concerning its permanent component. The extraction of the permanent
component of the money market interest rate is of interest for a11 three types of economic
agents: for the banks and market observers to be able to take better economic decisions
and for the central bank to be able to implement a better monetary policy with the goal
of price and output stabilization.16 Some authors (Kasman [1993], Ayuso, Haldane and
15Even t.he Bank of England [1988, 13-14], which follows an activist strategy on the money market,
writes about its possibilities of anticipating and neutralizing transit.ory money market shocks: "In order t,o
plan and to undert.ake its operations effident.ly. the Bank maintains running forecast.s of the cash position
of tlw banking syst.em - daily for several weeks ahead, and on a weekly or mont,hly basis over a longer
horizon... There is considerabJe ullavoidable uncertainty in such forecast.s. The faft.ors which contribut,e to
(,he market.'s position are known with varying degrees of certainty at. varying stages in advance." It. could
also be the case that the central bank is in principle capable of collecting all the information the private
banking sedor has about transitory money market shocks by itself and of intervening correspondingly,
hut, that. t.he resource costs of such a dat.a collection would be very high and t.hat it. is just. more efficient
t.o delegate t.he smoothing task to t.he private banks which are much doser to the necessary information.
16The estimation of the permanent component of the money market interest rate is import.ant because
20 

Restoy [1994], King [1994]) claim that a lIigher volatility of the short term interest rate
has 110 impact on signal extraction problems as there is no significant positive correlation
between the volatility of money market rates and the volatility of longer term (fÃ¼r example
one year) rates. But this reasoning does not necessarily seem convincing: If the volatility
of transitory liquidity shocks is less stable than the one of permanent shocks, then one
should not observe a positive correlation between the volatility of the short term rate and
the volatility of the long term rate. In periods of a large variance of thc transitory shocks,
economic subjects could learn only little about innovations in the permanent component.
Thus, the correlation between short- and long-term rate volatility could even be negative
and the low correlation between both volatilities does not prove the irrelevance of the
signal extraction problem.
In the model, central bank money is lent for exactly one period. At the beginning of each
period, central bank money (the only kind of money in the model) is alloted to banks for
one period via an auction to which the private banks have to submit demand functions.
After receiving the money, the banks lend money to their customers. If no averaging
provision exists, the money lent by banks to customers must correspond exactly to the
moneY received at the auction. At the end of the period, the customers return the money
to the banks and the banks return the money received at the auction to the central bank.
Olle could ask how interest is paid on the money lent as there is no money in the system
except that which is lento We can assurne that interest rates are paid in some real unit
as ounces of gold. As the relative price 'units of money per ounce of gold' is well-defined,
every interest rate payment can easily be expressed in ounces of gold.
In the following, three variants of the model will be presented. They differ with respect
to the ex ante knowledge of private banks concerning transitory money market shocks.
Thc two extreme cases of no averaging at all and unrestricted averaging will be analyzed
in all three variants. In the sections following section IV.3, different partial restrietions
to averaging will be discussed in the framework of the first variant.
it is correlat.'d (or even eorresponds) to t.he long-term interest rate via some arbitrage equation.
21 

IV.3 The information content of the money market interest rate with and
without averaging
The three variants (aL (b), a.nd (c) of the model each suppose a different anticipation
of the transitory shocks by the private banks. If averaging is allowed, the competing
banks (which are assumed to be identically informed) will participate to the first money
market auction in such a way that the expected money market interest rates in both
periods are equal (as long as this condition is not fulfilled, individual banks could lower
their refinancing costs by some intertemporal reallocation of refinancing). We thus have
to cakulate the money demand functions of the banks which guarantee this condition.
Assurne that. the money demand by bank customers is deterministic and constant in each
period. The difference between the quantity of money allotted to the banks in the money
market auction and the money passed on by the banks to their customers represents the
banks' reserve holdings in the respective period.
For reasons of simplicity, the demand functions submitted by banks to t.he money market
auction will be restricted to parallel shiftings of the money demand functions of the bank
customers. Let the aggregated money demand function of the customers be, in both
periods (t = 1,2):
m t
d = a - b"
z, (15)
where a, bare constants with a > 0, b > 0 and i is the rate of interest. to be paid. Let a
small 'm' stand in general for quantities of money lent to customers and a capital ']\;1' for
quantities of money at the level of the money markeL The quantity of money available at
the money market auction for the private banks is assumed to be, in the first and second
period respectively:
Mt = Al x - Yl + di1
(16)
]\1; M - x Y2 + di2 (17)
where d > 0 is a constant and x, Yl, Y2 are uncorrelated random variables with E(x) =
E(Yd = E(Y2) = 0 and Var(x) = a;, Var(Yl) =
a;, Var(Y2) = a;. This should be
interpreted as follows: the central bank offers a quantity of money Al + di, but this
supply is reduced (augmented) by demand shocks of x + Yl (period 1) and x + Y2 (period
2). Various causes of the money market shocks can be imagined. In the variants (a) and
(b) of the model, we can interpret the shocks as arising at the level of the banks just before
the auction. In this interpretation, the banks would face two kinds of money demand by
customers: one which is independent of interest rates, which cannot be infiuenced by the
banks, and which occurs as realizations of a random variable before the auction (x +Yl
in the first and x + Y2 in the second period); and one which depencls on the interest rate
22 

set by the banks and which is identical each period. Then, the banks would enter the
first money market auction with a demand function Mt = al - bi1
+:r +Yl and would be
confronted with the money supply MI = M +dito Keeping this possible interpretation
in mind, we further develop the model by formally localizing the shocks on the money
supply side. In the case of variant (c), it is more difficult to localize the shocks in the
banking sector.17
Without an averaging option, the market equilibrium of both periods has to be calculated
separately. With averaging, the model has to be solved in all variants in the following
three steps:
1. The private banks submit money demand functions Ml at - bit to the auctions
(t 1,2). The expected money market equations in both periods are thus:
(18) 

(19) 

Then, the expected equilibrium interest rates are:
(20) 

(21) 

In the intertemporal arbitrage equilibrium, those expected rates have to be identicaL
2. The (identical) expected interest rates ca,n be calculated from the condition that
over both periods, the money demanded by bank customers must correspond to the
money received by banks at the money market auctions) such that the bank reserves
are zero on average (a positive reserve requirement could be treated correspondin
gly):
E(Af{(i)) +E(Af;(i)) = m~(i) +m~(i) (22)
{:;> 2M - 2E(:r) E(yt} - E(Y2) +2di = 2a 2bi (23)
{:;> E(i*) _1_
(a _M +E(x) + E(Yd +E(Y2)) ' (24)
d+b 2
17Howevel', one could imagine a similar variant where the shock would occur at the level of the banks
after the auction. Then. the banks would have to decide after the shock on the allotment of money to
the regular customers' demand.
23 

3. With this equilibrium interest rate, al and a2 can now be calculated by substituting
into equations (20) and (21).
al = a _ E(Yl) + E(Y2) (25)
2 2
a2 = a
+ E(Yd _ --'-'---"- (26)
2
With the al cakulated, the banks enter the first auction in each of thc three variants (a),
(b), and (c).
Variant (a) of the model
In this variant, the private banks exact1y anticipate both transitory shocks YI, Y2 before
the first auction; interest rate differentials will be arbitraged away completely even ex
post. This property permits a representation of the two periods' money markets and the
aggregated market in a simple diagram. The equilibrium interest rate with averaging
can be found as the intersection of the aggregated demand and supply functions. By
drawing a line back to the individual periods' diagramms, one can determine the money
transferred to the bank customers and the refinancing balances.

The variables have thc following interpretation: if is the equilibrium interest rate in the
first period, if averaging is not allowed; i* is the equilibrium interest rate in both periods,
if a.veraging is allowed; M; (Mt') is t.he quantity of money allotted on the money market
to the banks in period 1, if averaging 1S (not) allowed; mi is the quantity of money lent by
the banks to their customers in period 1, if averaging is allowed; Mt is also the quantity
of money lent by the banks to their customers in period 1, if averaging is not allowed.
Corresponding variables are used for the second period. The reserve balance of t he banks
in t.he first period is M; mj'; in the second period t.he balance is exactly reversed and
equals mi  lvl2Â·
24
Before the first auction, when the banks plan al, a2, they anticipate perfectly the transitory
shocks; therefore: E(Yd = Yl and E(Y2) = Y2, implying: al = a + (-Yl + Y2)/2 and
a2 a +(Yl - Y2)/2, so that:
-* -* 1

The reserve balance of the banks in the first period is tlms: SI A1f(ir) - mt(ir)
al bir - (a - bij) = (-Yl +Y2)/2; in the second period it is S2 -SI-
We are now interested in measuring the information content of the interest rate concerning
its permanent component x, with and without averaging. The problem of estimating the
rea.Iization of unobservable random variables of which an observed variable is a linear
combination is treated in the theory of signal extraction (see for example Sargent [1979,
209J or Harvey [1993, 37-39]).
In the case of one observed variable, the linear least-square signal extraction model has the
following structure: Let i* be an observed variable and assurne that it is known that i* =
a'.Y, where a '
= (aO,al, ...a n ) is a vector of known coefficients, X = (XO,XI,X2,""Xn)'
is a vector of random variables, Xo 1 (deterministic) and for j l...n, E(xj) = 0,
Var(xj) a} and COV(Xj, Xl) 0, Vj =I- I. We are looking for a linear estimator of one
of the unobserved random variables, Xk, using the observation of i"'. One has thus to
calculate the two coefficients Ão, Ãl in the equation Xk = Ão +Ã1i*, in order to minimize
the squared error of the estimation:
It is shown in appendix 1.1 that the optimal coefficients Ão, Ãl are:
(28) 

By substituting those values of Ão, Ãl, one obtains the expected squared error in estimating
the unobserved variable Xk:
(29) 

Now, the quality of the extraction of the permanent component of the interest rate will be
analyzed. The cases with and without averaging will be compared, both for the situation
aft.er the first and the second period's auction. It will be shown that temporarily the
signal extraction is better with averaging than without.
25
Â· Information content of the interest rate in the first money market auction
With averaging. Here, the linear relationship between the interest rate and
the unobservable money market shocks is:
1 ~ Yl +Y2
d+b(a-M+x+ 2 )
By using the signal extraction formula (see appendix 1.1), we get the estimator
for the permanent component x:
E(xli~) = -(a
The expected squared error of the estimation is:
E((x - x?) =a;
Let us now introduce a numerical example which will be used several more
times in the course of the paper. Let d =0,5, b 0,5,
a; = 1,
a; 1, M = 5,
a = 10. Then, when observing for example ii = 8:
1 1
+8-=2
1,5 1,5
The interest rate expected for the second period is also 8. The interest rate
expectf'd in the long run (for the time after the maintenance period) is 7.
The squared errot' in estimating ;T (identical to the one of estimating the long
run interest rate) is 1/3. For each additional interest rate point observed, the
expectation concerning x, and in thf' specific example also the expectation
concerning the permanent interest rate rises by 2/3. This 'slope coefficient'
becomes smaller when the va.riance of Y rises and larger if the variance of x
rises. If a money market is exposed to a strong transitory shocks, the signal
concerning the long-term interest rate given by a rise in the interest rate by
one percentage point is weaker then on a money market with a low transi
tory volatility. Hence, if the transitory volatility rises, an adaptation of the
interpretation of changes in the money market rate prevents the expectatio
nal errors rising proportionally. But this adaptation cannot prevent. a certain
deterioration of the extraction of the permanent component of the interest rate.
It should be noted that the information content of the interest rate concerning
its permanent component (at the beginning of areserve maintenance period)
can be further increased by extending the maintenance period bf'yond two
periods. The expected squared error in estimating x (after observing the first
26 

auction'sinterest rate) will be, expressed as a function of the length n of the
maintenance period:
E((i: (30)
If the length of the maintenance periods goes to infinity, the expected squared
error approaches zero. Of course, the supply of central bank money would no
longer be well-defined with an infinite maintenance period.
No averaging. In this case, the interest rate in the first period will be:
Using again the signal extraction formula, we get the estimator for the perma
nent component:
The expected squared error is:
This error is al'llJaYs [arger than the one in the case of averaging. In the specific
example (d b = 0.5, 0"; = 0"; = 1, 1~1 = 5, a 10) with if = 8, the esÃmated
permanent component is:
1 1
E ( x 1Zl

and the squared error is 1/2. The expected interest rate for the second period
(which is identical to the interest rate expected in the long run) is E(iflif
8) = 6.5.

With averagillg. Both periods' interest rates are identical here, implying
that the second period cannot add any information to the first Ã¼ne, meaning:
The expected estimation error is also unchanged relative to the situation before
the second auction.
27 

Without averagmg. In this case, the interest rate of the second auction
contains additional information. As we observe now two independent interest
rates, we have to apply the signal extraction model generalized to TI observa
tions as presented in appendix 1.2. The linear relationship between the shocks
and the interest rate in the second period is:
- M+x +Y2)
Thus, the matrix A which describes the relationship between all observed va
riables and the unobserved shocks (Ur, if)' = ao +A.(x, YI, Y2)', see appendix
1.2) is:
A =
(d~b d~b ~)
d+b 0 d+b
By applying the signal extraction formula derived in appendix 1.2, we get the
two coefficients (ÃlJ Ã2)':
-:--(d_+_b
)_0';_0',,-;---,,- ( 11 )
[(0'; +0';)2 - O',i]
The identity of the weights of both interest rates follows from the symmetry
of both lines of the matrix A. The estimated values of (Ãll Ã2) have to be put
into the signal extraction formula
- .# 1
M)] +Ã2[Z2 - (d +b) (a M)]
This estimator has to be substituted into the squared estimation error which
yields a rather complicated expression. For the specific example (d = b 0.5,
0',; = 0'; :::; 1, M 5, a 10), we obtain the coefficients (ÃI,Ã2) = 0/3,1/3),
and thus, for example:
7 - 5 9 -.5
9) =--+--=2
3 3
The interest rate expected in the long run is 7. The squared estimation error
is 1/3. Thus, after both periods, the information content of interest rates is
independent 0/ whether averaging is allowed or not. This result is not only
valid for the specific example, but general.
In this variant (a) of our model, the information content of the money market rate can
thus be raised by granting an averaging option, but only temporarily. At the end of a
two-day maintenance period, observing the interest rates is equally informative with and
28 

without averaging. But since a temporary informational advantage is clearly useful for
economic decision taking during t.he maintenance period, we can conclude for this variant
of the model that averaging is useful.
Variant (b) of the model
In this variant, the banks only become informed about the second transitory shock after
the first money market auction. Before the first auction (when choosing ad, the banks
expectations are: E(Yd = Yl and E(Y2) Q. How does the uncertainty about the
seC"Ond transitory shock affect the relative quality of signal extraction with and without
averaging? To assure the identity of expected interest rates, the conditions al
= a Yd2
and E(a2) = a +Yd2 have to be respected and thus:
Just before the second period's auction, the banks learn about the second transitory
shock. From the first period, the banks have inherited a reserve balance 81
-yd2. The
balance in the second period must be 82
-5\. Beyond this necessary compensation of
the first period's balance, the banks should submit the 'natural' demand functions md(i)
to the auction, as no opportunity of intertemporal arbitrage remains after the first auction
has taken place. The market equilibrium condition in the second period is thus:
hÂ· Yl 1 ( - Yl )
a, - Z2
+ - - - a -M +x + - +Y2
2 d +b 2
Now we will again look at the information content of interest rates concerning the per
manent component in money scarcity, x .
Â· Information content of the interest rate in the first money market auction

NI +x + Yl)
2 

The estimator of the permanent shock is thus: 

E(xli~)
The squared error is:
E((x
29
In the specific exampIe (d = b = 0.5, <7; = <7; 1, M = 5, a = 10) the error
amounts to 0.2 which is less than in the corresponding case of the variant (a).
If for example the interest rate is 8, we have E(xlii = 8) = 2.4 and the rate
expected in the long run is 7.4.
- Without averaging: See variant (a)
Â· Information content of both period's interest rates taken together
- With averaging. The matrix A becomes:
A =
(d~b 2(d:b) 0)
2(d+b)
d~b
By substituting into the formula given in appendix 1.2, one gets the coefficients
fiI , ,82 , The coefficient Ã2 is always zero. This result can easily be understood
as the interest rate in the second period only contains additional noise relative
to the one in the first period (see the matrix A). In the specific example
(d b = 0.5; <7; 0-; 1; M = 5; a = 10), we obtain (Ãl,Ã2)=(0.8j 0). The
quadratic estimation error is unchanged relative to the first period, namely 0.2.
No averaging. See variant (a)
One can conlude for thc variant (b) of the model that the information content of the
interest. rate concerning its permanent component is strictly hetter with averaging, inde
pendent of whether only the first period's interest rate or both periods' interest rates are
considered.
Variant (c) of the model
In this variant, the banks only learn about the first and second pcriods' transitory money
market shocks after thc rcspective auction. Thus, when planning al before the first
auction, E(Yd E(Y2) = O. As the banks have no useful knowledge about thc transitory
shocks before the first period to engage in intertemporal arbitrage, al = a will be chosen
and the equilibrium interest rate is:
Coutrary to the two preccding variauts, the auction itself reveals new information to the
banks which is used to decide about thc reserve balance SI and the quantity of money leut
to customers ml. It is assumed that the banks know Yl exactly after the first auction.I8
18This would be the ca.'3e if the banks knew the value of x. An alternative assumption would be that
the banks have to engage in signal ext.raction themselves after the auction t.o estimate Yl (this would be
a variant (d) of the model).
30 

The quantity of money lent to customers, ml, has to be determined after the first auction
such that E(m'2) = ml and such that the marginal return of holding money (for the bank
customers) corresponds to the expected refinancing costs in period 2:
E(i;) = (mf(i~)rl(= (m~(i;)rl)
.... 1 d+b 
M+x)=b(a-m)<=:>a2 -m)+M-E(x)
In addition, the condition must be fulfilled that the reserve holding balances in both
periods balance out exa.ctly:
82(m,a2) = -81
(m,ad <=:> 82(m,a2) -81
(m,a)
* m - (0,2 b (d
~
b(a2 NI +X)) ) = ( m ( a - b (d

b(0, - 1\1 +x +Yd) ) )

By substituting and rearranging, we obtain:

b2

Knowing 0,2 we call caIculate the interest rate of the second period:

d +b 0, - M +x + 2b +dYl +Y2
Now, we compare again the information content of interest rates with and without ave
ragmg.
Â· Information cOlltent. after the first money market auction
With averaging This case corresponds to the one without averaging in the
variants (a) and (b).
No averaging See variants (a) and (b).
Â· Information content of both periods' interest rates taken together.
- With averaging. The matrix A now takes the following form:

By substituting illtO the signal extraction formula, one can calculate the co
efficients ,ÃJ,/32' In the specific example (d b 0.5, er; = er; = 1, NI 5,
a = 10) we have (131; /32) = (0.318; 0.273). The squared standard error amounts
to 0.409.
31
- No averaging. See variants (a) and (b).
Interestingly, the information content of both periods' interest rates is now lÃ¼gher
without averaging then with averaging. The first lines of the matrices A (the first
period's interest rate equations) are identical. But in the second lines (the second
period's interest rate equations) one can see an additional noise term in the case of
averaging relative to the case without averaging. This noise term is related to thc
fact that the surprise in the first money market auction implies an inverse balancing
nced in the second period.
In the following table 2, the resuIts of all three variants of the money market model are
displayed far the cases of averaging and no averaging and for thc situation after one and
after two periods. The twelve cases reviewed are ranked (rank 1 to rank 4) concerning

The information content of the interest rate after the first money market auction is always
at least as good with averaging as in the case without averaging. Hence, a dear advantage
of averaging provisions can be etablished at this level. Only in the variant (c) of thc
model i8 the information content of the interest rate identical under both institutional
arrangements.
19'A' = Averaging; 'nA' = no averaging
32
After the second money market auction no one arrangement clearly dominates. In variant
(a), both have identical informational properties. In variant (b), the quality of signal
extraction is better with an averaging option. In variant (c), observers of the interest
rates can learn more about their permanent component if there is no averaging provision.
All in all, one may conclude that an averaging provision is certainly favorable to signal
extraction at the beginning of a maintenance period and that its total benefits should be
ceteris paribus higher, the better the banks participating in the money market anticipate
transitory liquidity shocks.
After having analyzed the extreme cases of unlimited averaging and no averaging at all,
we will review intermediate arrangements in the next section. Intertemporal arbitrage
may be restricted by a limitation of the reserve balance, by a reserve balance fee (in the
form of a difference between the overdraft and the surplus interest rate) or by the setting
of an interest rate corridor implemented by a deposit and a lending facility. Only the
variant (a) of the model will be considered, but the results in variant (b) would be rather
similar.
IVA The effect of limiting the reserve balance
Existing minimum reserve arrangements with averaging provisions (as in the US or in
Germany) have a limitation to the overdraft relative to the required average reserve hol
ding: banks are not allowed to have a negative balance on their central bank account
overnight. Therefore, the maximum allowed reserve balance corresponds to the size of the
reserve requirement. This is not a general necessity. In principle, the limitation of the
reserve balance (the allowed overdraft relative to the required reserves) is independent of
the size of the reserve requirement. For example, the averaging around zero - arrangement
of the Bank of Canada allows for overdrafts without having a positive reserve requirement
at all.20 With a positive reserve requirement, one could imagine granting an averaging
capacity of one half, 01' double, or tripie of the reserve requirement, and so on.21 We
will now analyze briefly in the framework of variant (a) of the model presented above the
implications of a limitation of the averaging capacity for the information content of the
interest rate concerning its permanent component.
Suppose that the aggregated averaging capacity (the allowed reserve balance) of the banks
2
0See Bank of Canada [1991], Freedman [1991], and Clinton [1996] for an overview of the Canadian
syst.em.
21 If the averaging capac.ity is bigger than the reserve requirement, then banks should be required to
provide collaterals for the net. overdrafts.
33
is limited to Smax. Vve can then derive critical values of the difference between the
first period's and the second period's transitory shocks, at which the averaging capacity
is exactly exhausted. Pairs of shocks with bigger differences cannot lead to additional
arbitrage. The information content of the interest rate thus must be interpreted by
taking into account the fact that the interest rate can be the result of three different
linear equations mapping the shocks into the interest rates. It has been shown above that
the balance in period 1 in variant (a) of the model is: 51 = (-Yl + Y2) /2. Thus, the
maximum averaging capacity will be exhausted if I- Yl + Y21 ~ 25max. If the averaging
capacity is exhausted, the linear relationship between the money market shocks and the
iuterest rate is transformed into another linear relationship. \Ve thus have to distinguish
among three situations:
1. If IYl - Y21 < 2Smax, the linear relationship between the shocks and the observed
interest rate is:
'. 1 ( ~-.,. + + Yl + Y2 )
Z
= -- a - lVi X
1 d +b 2
- 5 max - M + x + Yl)
3. If (Yl - Y2) :S -2Sma.x, then al = a + Smax and thus:
'. 1 ( 5 M- \
Z1 = d + b a + max - - + x + Yl )
The bigger Smax is, the more often case 1 is the underlying one, and the more similar the
signal extraction problem becomes here to the one with unlimited averaging. The smaller
Smax, the more often cases 2 or 3 are relevant, and the more similar the signal extraction
problem becomes to the one without any averaging.
In appendix 2.1, the calculations to obtain the information content of interest rates in the
case of a limited averaging capacity are given. Here, we only look at the signal extraction
problem in the specific example (d = b = 0.5, u; u; = 1, M = .5, a = 10) with normally
distributed shocks and represent the information content of the interest rate as a function
of Sma.x graphically.

The expected estimation error falls as a convex function from 1/2 at Smax
o to 1/3
as Smax -7 00. The marginal costs of narrowing the averaging capacity (with respect to
informational efficiency) thus rise monotonously. If the central bank only has an aversion
to very large reserve balances of the banks, it can forestall such balances by a sufficiently
broad limitation without badly damaging the information content of interest rates.
IV.5 The effect of an averaging fee
It is costless for banks to undertake intertemporal arbitrage activity in the framework of
areserve averaging facility if reserve overdrafts and surpluses are rewarded and charged
respectively with the same interest rate. This has not necessarily to be the case. The
Bank of Canada's avemging around zero system charges interest rates on overdrafts but
does not remunerate the required compensating surpluses (Bank of Canada [1991, 26]).
Let ih be the credit interest rate for positive balances and let is be the debit interest rate
for negative balances with is
2: ih . In our two-period model, the averaging fee then is,
independently of whether the overdraft takes place in the first or second period, equal
to IS1\(is
ih ). The competing banks will smooth the interest rate until the expected
interest rate difference IE(iz) - E(idl exactly equals is
ih Â· Let us define A = is - ih
as the cost of averaging. Again, we will focus exclusively on variant (a) of the model.
Similarly to the case of a limitation to the averaging capa.city, three situations have to be
distinguished:
1. If IE(iz) EUl)1 ~ A ~ -A(d +b) ~ Yl - Yz ~ A(d +b) without any averaging
35 

activity, then no averaging will take place, so that:
1
d +b(a M +x
+Yl )
2. If E(i2) - E(id > A {:} Yl - Y2 > A(d +b) without any averaging activity, then
the banks will have an overdraft in the first period, 51 > 0, so that: i2 - i 1
= A,
implying:
1 ( - Yl +Y2) A
d+b a-M+x+ 2 +2
3. If (E(i2) - EUl)) > >. {:} Yl - Y2 < ->'(d +b) without any averaging activity,
then the banks will have a reserve surplus in the first period, 51 < 0, so that:
-(E(i2 ) - E(il )) A, implying:
'* 1 ( - Yl +Y2) >.
ZI = d +b a - M +x + 2 - '2
Thc higher the averagillg fee, the more often the first situation is relevant and the more
the signal extraction problem resembles to the one without any averaging at all. The lower
thc averaging fee, the more often situations 2 and 3 are relevant and the more the signal
extraction problem resembles the case of unlimited averaging. The formal treatment of
thc signal extraction from the first period's interest rate in the case of an averaging fee
can be found in appendix 2.2. Again, we will restrict ourselves here to looking at the
information content of the interest rate after the first auction graphically in the specific
example (d b 0..5,
a; = a; = 1, NI = .), a 10) with normally distributed shocks.
The expected squared error in estimatillg the permanent component x is plotted in the
following figure as a funet,ion of the averaging fee. The squared error starts with 1/3 (no
fee) and grows monotonously to 1/2 (infinite fee). The function is convex up to a certain
value of >. and then becomes concave. By imposing a small averaging cost, thc central
bank can prevent averaging taking place in thc case of small transitory shock differentials
without badly harming informational efficiency.

In the case of an averaging fee, the aspect of income generated for the central bank may be

she can choose a corresponding optimal ,\ which has to be smaller or equal to the ,\ which
maximizes income. Obviously, the central bank can come elose to the income maximizing

IV.6 The role of an interest rate corridor implemented by a deposit and a
lending facility
If x, the permanent shock to the scarcity of money, is interpreted exclusively as a variable
in the hand of the central bank, and if one thus interprets the problem of communicating
information via the money market interest rate as a problem of revealing the intended
central bank policy, then it would be best - in the framework of our model - to set a very
narrow interest rate corridor implemented by two standing facilities. This way, the central
bank could completely stabilize the interest rate and reveal ;1: as precisely as desired. The
fact that no central bank has chosen such a framework shows that the central bank wants
the money market interest rate to reveal information about (permanent) developments
coming from the central bank money demand side. The central bank may desire such an
information revelation for itself (to use the information in its monetary policy decisions)
and also for other market observers. In this section, we thus assurne that x is exclusively
a variable reflecting developments in the structural component of the scarcity of money
coming from the side of the market.
If the ioterest rate is adsorbed by one of the corridor rates, some information about x is
lost. The more narrow the corridor is, the more information is thus lost. If the interest
rates of the deposit and lending facilities are identical, the observation of the interest rate
is naturally worthless and E(x - X)2 =
a;. There are critical values of
x Yd2 +Y2/2
which lead to a corridor interest rate and beyond which the size of this sum is irrelevant
for the observed interest rate. In the corridor implemented by the deposit rate iez and the
lending rate i1Zl
the interest rates ii' and if are distributed as if there were no corridor.
Let j* and j# be the interest rate variables with and without averaging, as weIl as without

The density functions are drawn as thick points at izz ,iez
to express that they cannot
be represented correctly here as a positive probability lies on a base of size zero. The
figure illustrates that a narrowing of the corridor reduces the difference in the information
content of interest rates between the cases with and without averaging: the narrower
the corridor is, t.he more often the same interest rate occurs with and without averaging,
namely a lending rate or a deposit rate.
The- decision of the centraI bank about the width of the corridor may depend primarily
on the ide-a it has about the direction of the information flows via the money market
interest rate: from the central bank to the private banking sector or from the private
banking sector to the central bank. The more the centraI bank itself uses the interest
rate to assess the structural developments in the demand for central bank money, the
wider thc corridor should be. If the money market rate is primarily designed to reveal
information about the central bank's policy intentions, the corridor should be narrow and
the relf>vance of having an averaging option becomes small.
IV.7 Selection and combination of restrietions to averaging
FoUl' possibilities to reduce the quantity of averaging can be considered: (1) limiting the
allowed private banks' reserve balances, (2) charging an averaging fee, (3) implementing
an interest ra.te corridor by two standing fa.cilities, and, if one quits the framework of our
two-period model: (4) the shortening of the length of the maintenance period.
How and to what extent the averaging activity should be restricted naturally depends on
the motivations for this restriction. There is no extensive analysis of this question in the
minimum reserve literature. Let us briefly discuss two possible motivations.
39
The fi1'St follows from the fact that the granting of an unrestricted averaging option
implies the inability of the central bank to implement anticipated changes of money market
interest rates in the course of an averaging period. In the medium term, there is an optimal
nominal interest rate being a function of, among others, the inflation rate, the inflation
rate relative to the target rate, the degree of capacity utilization, exogenous shocks, etc.
The centra.l bank tries to implement an interest rate path that follows as closely as possible
the path of the optimal interest rate. Let us assurne now that the central bank and the
private banks know the path of the optimal interest rate. Then, the private banks will
smooth out the anticipated changes of the nominal interest rate, independently of whether
they are due to transitory shocks 01' to attempts of the central bank to have the interest
rate follow changes in the optimal interest rate. Then the interest rate will not follow
the optimal path but will move around this path in steps. In the following figure, this
is il1ustrated for the case of an optimal interest rate following a path i = 6 t/4 and
maint.enauc<' periods of onf' aud four mondls.

Figure 7
The deviations of the effective interest rate from the optimal one imply a suboptimal
monetary steering of the economy with related welfare losses. The longer the maintenance
period, the bigger the average deviation will be and the bigger th~ welfare losses due to
the subotimal monetary steering will be: In the case of falling optimal interest rates
lt 70 a.t (0 > 0) and an Tl - month maintenance period, the average deviation of the
Interest rate from its optimal value is na/2.
An obvious reduction in this deviation can therefore be attained by shortening the main
tenance period.22 Other possibilities to reduce or eliminate this problem completely are
22Meulendyke und Tnlpan [1993] (see also for example Spindt and Tarhan [1984]) discuss the pros and
cons of carry-oller-pr'ovisions, which allow to the banks to carry over reserve balances at the end of a
maintenance period into the following maintenance period. Such provisions currently do not eXlst in
Germany, but in the US, where hanks can carry over up to two percent of their reserve requirement as a
balance into the next maintenance period. The pros and wns of carry-over provisions should have some
40 

to impose a maximum reserve balance Smax or a fee A. If the averaging fee is bigger than
na/2, there will be no smoothing out of anticipateel optimal interest rate changes. If the
fee is lower, the interest rate will be fixed elose to the beginning and end of the averaging
period. In the middle of the period, the interest rate will still follow the optimal path. If
the central bank chooses a monetary quantity path consistent with the optimal interest
rate path if no averaging is allowed, then the introduction of an averaging option with a
maximum reserve balance implies a fixed rate in the middle of the averaging period and a
parallel path t.o the optimum path elose to the heginning and end of the period. It should
be noticed that the central bank can ultimately implement any interest rate path if there
is a limit to the reserve balance by varying the quantity of reserves supplied sufficiently
in the course of the averaging period.
The 8ccond motivation for limiting the amount of averaging activity can be derived from
the variant. (c) of the two-period model presented in section III.3. It has been shown there
that in the case of unanticipated transitory shocks, the anticipation errors that occured
in tbc time span since the beginning of an averaging period add noise to the interest
ratf' anel thus do harm to the quality of signal extraction. The longer the maintenance
pf'riod, the stronger this effect should become.23 The beginning of a maintenance period
is always a phase of a special purity of the interest rate signal: first, there is a relatively
long time horizon for averaging, and second there is no noise ballast resulting from former
unanticipateel transitory shocks. It is thus in a certain sense advantageous to have frequent
heginnings of maintenance periods. The optimallength of a maintenance period could be
calculated in the framework of a modellike the one presented in section III.2 generalized
to n periods anel to both anticipat.ed and unanticipated transitory shocks.
Another question is whether an averaging fee or a limitation of the banks' balances is
preferable if one wishes any restrictions to the averaging activity. With an averaging
fee, all pairs of transitory shocks (Yl,Y2) = (Yl'Yl +e) with e > A(d +b) are mapped
into the same interest rate. With a limitation to reserve balances, this is in a certain
way reversed: if the difference hetween both transitory shocks is relatively small, all
pairs of shocks are mapped into the same interest rate, namely all pairs (Yl, Yl + e) with
similarities with those of the lengthening of the maintenance period. The carry-over reduces the variance
on t.he last days of the maintenance periods, but this variance may at least partlally show up in the next
period. The existence of a carry-over provision in the PS has to be considered in relation t.o the length of
t.he mailltenance period of only two weeks. An argument for the German solution of a longer averaging
period (olle month) without the possibility of carrying over balances may be that it is somehow simpler.
We do not intend to review the arguments for and against carry-over provisions in more detail here.
23Meulendyke and Tulpan [1993. 174-177] refer to a similar reason for restricting the amount of
averaging.
41
-Smax/2 < e < Smax/2. We can conclude that, roughly speaking, with a fee, the large
transitory shocks are better smoothed away than the weak ones, and with a limit to the
reserve balance the weak transitory shocks are better smoothed away than the large ones
(but we should keep in mind that weak transitory shocks are more frequent than large
ones). Beyond those considerations, the following two arguments speak in favor of an
averaging fee:
Â· The fee A is a source of income for the central bank. If all other welfare effects of
the fee are similar to those of a corresponding balance maximum, then the fee is
preferable because in general, the marginal welfare cost of public income generated
by taxes is positive.
Â· If a fee is imposed, it is irrelevant how the information about transitory shocks
is spread among different banks. Even if only some few banks are informed, the
amelioration of informational efficiency will be as good as if the whole banking
sedor had this information. If the balances are limited, this is not the case: the
fewer banks are informed, the smaller the balancing capacity iso The assumptions
that the dispersion of information varies from transitory shock to transitory shock
and that in most cases only a minority of banks are informed seems realistic. Then
the signal extraction problem becomes relevant for the whole banking sector, too,
and the dispersed knowledge about a variety of transitory shocks not only has to
be transmitted to other sectors of the economy, hut also has to be aggregated (and
revealed) in the banking sedor itself. The theory of aggregation of various pieces
of dispersed information into one price is another topic in the theory of information
revelation as analyzed early by Grossman & Stiglitz [1976, 249-250].
The argument may be expanded to the case in which it is costly for banks t.o become
informed about transitory shocks. In the case of a fee, only a few banks have to invest.
in the production of the relevant information. In the case of a balance limitation,
thc quantity of resomces spent for information production would have to be larger
to attain the same degree of informational efficiency because more banks have to
become informed to provide a certain volume of balances.
An advantage of a balance limitation may be that with such an arrangement the centra]
bank can always implement any interest rate path if it sufficiently varies the reserve supply
in the course of the averaging period.
What can be said about the interactions of a corridor with an averaging fee amI with
a limitation of the reserve balance? In the case of a combination of a. corridor with
42 

a limitation of the reserve balance, from a certain narrowness of the corridor on, the
maximum balances will never be attained, so that they are irrelevant and redundant. In
the case of a combination of a corridor with an averaging fee, there will never be any
averaging activity if the fee has a certain size relative to the width of the corridor. As
in both cases, a money market with identical properties can be constructed with simpler
rules, both cases should be avoided.
The systems in use in the US and Germany work with a balance limitation (corresponding
to the volume of required reserves). In Germany, this limit is never used up by the banking
sector as an aggregate. This could be interpreted as showing that there is no effective
limitation to balancing in Germany. But that interpretation is not necessarily correct if
one agrees that the ex ante information on shocks is not always widely spread among
banks. The informed banks may have used up their balance while others do not use
their balances at all because they do not have the relevant knowledge for averaging. The
information content of the interest rate then could not reach the qua1ity it would have
with unlimited averaging.
43 

V. Conclusions
In this paper, the contributions of reserve requirements to the stabilization of financial
markets and economic activity were analyzed, stressing the role played by incomplete
information. If one agrees that in a world of perfect information, money is a neutral veil,
it becomes doubtful whether a theory of money which does not rely on the economics of
information can bc helpful. In thc theory of economic policy, this view has generally been
accepted since the introduction of the theory of rational expectations. In the theory of
monetary order, it is also not new, but in many approaches, the underlying informational
problems are still rather implicit. Especially section IV of the paper contributed to a more
basic incomplete information foundation of one aspect of reserve requirements, namely
averaging prOVISIons.
Altogether, four functions of minimum reserve requirements were analyzed m varymg
degrees of depth in this paper:
1. Areserve requirement contributes to the structural demand for central bank money.
This may be of interest to guarantee the existence of any demand for central bank money
01' to roughly neutralize a strong decline in the natural demand for it (section II.1). As
important technological innovations have to be expected in the near future in the use
of money as a means of pa,yment by non-banks and in the area of payment systems,
this function of reserve requirements could become relevant. Therefore, even if the re
serve requirements are reduced for other reasons to zero for some while, the instrument
should be preserved such that it could be reactivated any time. This would contribute
to the confidence of economic agents into the capacity of the central bank to determine
in all eventualities the scarcity of central bank money and thus to control indirectly its
purchasing power.
2. Areserve requirement. is in a cert.ain wa,y also a t.ax on bank deposit,s and thus has to
be analyzed from t.he point of view of t.he t.heory of opt.imal taxation (section 11.2). The
high degree of int.ernational mobilit.y of some of the banks' liabilities subject t.o reserve
requirements speaks in favor of a harmonization of the concerned reserve ratios in the
region of high mobility of capital. In the case of such a harmonizat.ion, it would be much
more difficult to argue t.hat the marginal welfare losses of areserve requirement 'tax' are
higher than those of other taxes generating public income. If harmonization were not
possible, one could also think about remunerating reserves to reduce or eliminate any
taxation aspect and t.hus any related distortion.
44
3. The incompleteness of the remuneration of required reserves should influence in the real
world (where information is dispersed) in an idiosyncratic way macroeconomic stability
and the variability of GDP around its natural (or goal) value (section III). On the other
hand, it should be very difficult to estimate the corresponding optimal reserve ratios.
Moreover, it is not dear at all apriori that a small reserve requirement should be better
that none. Finally, the stabilization impact of a small reserve requirement (due to that
function) like the one currently in effect in Germany is likely to be weak anyway.
4. If minimum reserves only have to be fulfilled on average over a certain maintenance
period) banks can smooth away anticipated transitory money market shocks and thereby
raise the information content of money market rates concerning their permanent compo
nent. For this function, it is not relevant (on an abstract) model-theoreticallevel) whether
required reserves are remunerated or not, and, as the capacity of banks to build up tem
porarily reserve balances is not necessarily tied to the size of areserve requirement, it is
also irreleva.nt how large the reserve requirement is (section IV). This positive informa
tional impact seemed to be relatively robust, such that one is tempted to conclude that
an averaging option granted for aperiod that is not too long should be advantageous for
informational flows and financial stability under the circumstances of the US or German
money market, despite the fact that it seems difficult to derive empirically an optimal ave
raging system (in the sense of estimating a money market model and using the estimated
parameters in some optimality conditions derived theoretically).
In Germany (and many other countries), the four functions have up to now been im
plemented together in the form of an unremunerated minimum reserve requirement with
averaging. However, it has been argued here that the functions may be at least split into
three groups that can be implemented independently. Only the functions 2 and 3 cannot
be analyzed and implemented independently.
Certainly, many issues remain to be solved. To mention only a few: (1) It should be
possible to integrate both stabilization arguments (the arguments of section 111 and IV)
in the framework of one model. (2) The model of section IV could be enriched by the
introduction of areaction function of the central bank (taking into consideration the
incomplete information the central bank has about the permanent component of the
interest rate). The interest rate would change its time series properties but the structure
of the signal extraction problem would in principle remain. A more general formulation
of the transitory and permanent shocks and of the time structure of the model would be
necessary. (3) Is it possible to analyze in a marginalistic framework the question of the
optimal length of the averaging period and of the restrietions to averaging in the form of
45 

limitations to reserve baJances and averaging fees and would it be possible to implement
this model empirically,?z4 (4) Is it possible to work out more precisely the nature of the
positive externality of liquidity cushions of banks operating on the money market which
was assumed to be the ultimate source of the benefits of averaging provisions'?
It should be a general task of future research to further develop the idea that the theories
of monetary order and of monetary policy are interrelated and should always be based on
an analysis of a situation of strategie interaetion of eeonomic subjects with some explieitly
defined informational ineompleteness and asymmetry.
24Hamilton [1996] shows that it is possible to analyze empirically even relatively complicated institu
tional details of the money market..

Appendix 1: The basic least square signal extraction formula
Appendix 1.1 One observation and n unobserved shocks
Let i* be the observed variable and assurne that it is known that
i* ciX (32)
where cl = (0'0, a}, ...an ) is a vector of known coefficients, X =(xo, Xl> X2, ... , Xn)' is a vec
tor of random variables, Xo 1 (deterministic) and for j l...n E(xj) 0, Var(xj) = a]
and C'ov(Xj, xd = 0, Vj =f l. We are looking for a linear estimator of one of the unobserved
random variables, ;Tk. using the observation of i*. We therefore have to ca1culate the two
coefficient.s Ão, ÃI in t.he equation Xk = /30+ÃIi*, in order to minimze the squared error
of t.he estimation:
The squared error is:
= E(Ã6 +2ÃOÃla'X - 2ÃOXk +Ã;(a'X)2 - 2(Ãda'Xxk +x%)
(36 +2/30 ÃlaO+,8; (0'6 +

Setting the first derivative with respect to Ão equal to zero and solving for Ão yields:

By substituting those values of Ão, Ãl, we obtain the expected squared error in estimating
the unobserved variable Xk:

Appendix 1.2 The case of m observations and n unobserved shocks
The linear relationship between the m observations (i~, i;, ...,i;;,J and the n unobserved
components (XI, X2, ..., Xn) is:

(35)
Written in matrix notation: i* = ao +Ax with i* E Rm, ao E Rm, A E Rm.n, x E Rn. The
problem can be simplified by defining: z i* - ao and thus: z Ax. We are looking for
a vector Ã ERn! satisfying: Ã = argmin(E(Xk - Xk)2) with Xk = Ã'z. By substitution we
obtain:
E(Xk - Xk)2 E(Ã'Ax Xk)2 = E((Ã'Ax)2 2Ã'AxXk +x%)
= E((Ã'Ax)(Ã'Ax)' 2Ã'AxXk +x%) = E(Ã'Ax(Ax)'Ã 2Ã'AxXk +x~)
Following LÃ¼tkepohl [1991, S. 4701 (proposition 2), thc derivative of the first term with
respect 1.0 Ã is:
ÃÃ'A~~Ax)'Ã = (Ax(Ax)' +(Ax(Ax)')')Ã = 2Axx'AÃ
The derivative of the second term is, again following LÃ¼tkepohl [1991, S. 4701 (proposition
1):
Ã¶2Ã'AXXk = 2(A )
Ã!~ XXk
The derivative of the third term ls zero. If the complete derivative is set equal to zero,
we obtain after rearranging:
2AE(xx')A'Ã = 2AE(xXk)
If this equation is multiplied from the left side by (2AE( xx')A,)-l, we obtain the vector
Ã which minimizes the expected squared error:
Ã = (AE(xx')A')-1 AE(xXk) (36)
By substituting this best estimator in the squared error function, we obtain the minimum
squared error:
= ((AE(:rx')A')-l AE(:rXk))'AE(xx')A'((AE( xx')A')-l AE( XXk))
-2(AE(xx')A')-IAE(xXk))'AxXk +a;

Appendix 2: The information content of the money market rate with restric
tion to averaging
Appendix 2.1: The information content of the money market rate with a
limitation to the reserve balance in variant (a) of the money market model
If the maximum reserve balance allowed is Smax, a certain observed interest rate can be
the result of three different mappings of unobserved random shocks, depending on the
difference between the two transitory shocks:
1. If IYl - Y21 < 28max , then the mapping is:
.* 1 (M- Yl + Y2
11 = d +b a - . +x + 2
We shall define jl as the random variable corresponding to this random variable ii.
2. If (Yl - Y2) ~ 2Smax, then al = a - Smax and thus:
Smax - M + x + Yl)
We shall define h as the random variable corresponding to this random variable
ir.
3. If (YI - Y2) :::; -2Sman then al a + Smax and thus:
+ Smax - M+ x + Yl)
We shall define h as the random variable corresponding to thiB random variable it.
The information content of the money market rate after the first auction can be calculated
as follows as a function of Smax. To calculate the density function J(ii), one can sum up
the three density function J(jl), J(h)' J(j3) while assuring by the choice of the limits
of the integrals in the calculation of the marginal densities that the (Yl - Y2) are in the
relevant range:25
25A remark cOllcerning the notation "fu(v)" ofthe density fUllctions: The variable in the index is the
one determining the density function. The variable in the bracket is the one which is mapped into a
probability. If both are identical, the variable in the index can be omited.
49 

(38)
The value of the realization of xis never relevant for the probability of being in one of the
three eases. Thus, the impact of the transitory shoeks on the interest rate ean be analyzed
in a first step independently of x. If x is set to be eonstant, then ij (respeetively jll j2, h)
is only a function of the two transitory shocks Yl, Y2. In the following, let x O. Then
the relationship between jl,Yt,Y2 is: jl = (a - NI +(Yl +Y2)/2)/(d +b). Whenever this
equation is fulfilled, then fUI ,Yl ,Y2} = fUI ,Y2b else f(jl ,Y11Y2) = O. Let us define q(j, Yt, Y2) as
a functioll equal to one if the equation is fulfilled and equal to zero if it is not. The first
term of f(ii) then ean be written as follows:
The inner integral in this expression can only have either the value one or the value zero.
It is one if 2( (d +b)jl a.
+AI Jh/2) E [Yl - 2Smax,Yl +2Smax]. But then, we ean omit
this integral if we make sure that we integrate only over the va1ues of Yl for whieh this
condition is fulfilled. Thus:
Yl - 2Smax < 2((d +b)jl - Cl +NI - Yd2) < Yl +28max
We shall designate the lower bound as Ql and the upper bound as Q2. Then, the first
term of f(
in ean be written as follows:
Concerning the seeond term of fUn: Y2 does not appear in the equation defining h.
Thus, Y2 is statistieally independent of the other random variables and the term ean also
be writtell as folIows:
But the density feh.lI,) contains a linear interdependenee, namelY:)1 (a Smax NI +
Yd/(d +b). Thus, the second term of f(ii) ean be transformed similarly to the first one:
The restriction on one unique value of Yl E [-00, +00] ean be expressed by omitting the
exteriorintegral amI by substituting Yl in the limits of the inner integral by the linear
.50

relationship in ir. Let R1
= (d +b)ir - a +Smax +M - 2Smax (d +b)ii a - Smax +M.
Then the second term of f(in finally becomes:
After similar transformations, one can express the third term of fU;) as:
with R2
= (d + b)ii a - Smax +Ãl +2Smax (d +b)ii - a + Smax +M. Finally, the
density f(ii ,x=O) can be summarized as follows:
(39)
In the two following figures, the specific example a
= 10; M 5; 0'; 1; 0'; = 1; d
0..5; b = 0.5 with normally distributed shocks is illustrated. In the figure on the left, density
functions of the interest rate are plotted for various values of Smax under the assumption
that.1: O. The values Smax considered are 0 (corresponding to the case without any
averaging); 0.2; 0.5; 1; 3; 20 (corresponds practically to the case of unlimited averaging).
The variance of the interest rate caused by the transitory shocks can be chosen precisely
in t.he range given by the two extreme arrangements of none and unlimited averaging.

Appendix 2.2: The information content of the money market rate with an
averaging fee in variant (a) of the money market model
Similarly to the case of a limitation to the reserve balance, in the case of an averaging fee
A, three situations have to be distinguished:
1. If without any intertemporal arbitrage of the banks, the condition IE(i2 ) - E(idl :::;
A {::} -A(d + b) :::; YI - Y2 :::; A(d + b) is fulfilled, then no arbitrage activity takes
place and the interest rate equation in the first auction is:
1 
d + b(a - M +x +Yd
We shall define)1 as the randorn variable corresponding to this randorn variable ii:.
2. If without any intertemporal arbitrage activity E(i2) - E(i1 )
> A {::} YI Y2 >
A(d + b), then the banks will build up a refinancing balance SI > 0 such that:
E(i2 ) - E(i1 ) = A. Then the interest rate equation in the first auction becornes:
.* 1 ( - Yl +Y2) A
Zl
= d +b a - M +x + 2 +2"
We shall define h as the random variable corresponding to this randorn variable ii:.
:3. Jf without any intertemporal arbitrage activity (E(i2 ) - E(id) > A {::} YI - Y2
<
-A(d +b), then the banks will build up a refinancing balance SI < 0 in the first
period, such that: -(E(i2 )
E(id) A. In this case the interest rate equation in
the first auction becornes:
1 ( - Yl +Y2) A
-- a-M+x+ -
d +b 2 2
We shall define j3 as the random variable corresponding to this randorn variable i;:.
To calculate the density function J(
in, we must once again surnmarize three different
density functions while assuring by properly chosen limits of the integrals that (Yl - Y2)
is always in the relevant range:
1

J(i7) = !(jl ,Yl ,Y2) (i7, YI, Y2 )dY2dYl

-00 Yl+'\(d+b)
If x is a constant, then ii becomes a linear function only in the two random variables Yl
and Y2. The realization of the permanent shock is again irrelevant for the probabilities of
the three different cases, so that again, the stochastic influence of x can be neglected in a
first step. Again, set x = O. Then the linear relationship between the variables j1, Yt, Y2
is: 11 = (a - M + Yd/(d + b). The random variable Y2 does not appear in the equation
determining j1. Thus Y2 is statistically independent of the other random variables and
the first term can also be written:
1

+00
lYl+'\(d+b)
1+00

f(jl'Yl'Y2)(i~, Y1, Y2)dY2dYl = f(jJ,yJ) f(Y2)(Y2)dY2 dYl 

-00 Yl-,\(d+b) -00 Yl-,\(d+b) 

The density fUl,Yl) now still contains the linear relationship mentioned above. Let q(jll Yl)
hf' a function which takes the value 1 if the relationship is fulfilled and zero if it is not.
Then the first term may be written as follows:
+'x' 1+00
jYl +,\(d+b) jYl +,\(d+b)
fjl,Yl u;, Yd f(Y2)(Y2)dY2 dYl = q(i~, YdfJl (i;) f(Y2) (Y2)dY2dYl
1
-= Yl -'\(d+b) -00 Yl-'\(d+b)
But this restriction by q on one unique value of Yl E] 00, oo[ can also be expressed by
omitting the exterior integral and by substituting Yl in the limits of the inner integral
by the linear relationship in ii. Define R1
= (d + b)jl - a + M - >.(d + b) and R 2
(d + b)jl a + M + >'(d + b). Then the first term of f(i';J can finally be written:
In the second term, the linear relationship between hand Yl, Y2 is (for x 0):
}f;f + Yl + Y2) + ~
2 2
Whenever this equation is fulfilled, f(h'Yl'YZ) = fUl,Yll' otherwise f(jl'Yl'YZ) = O. We shall
define q(ii, Yt, Y2) as a function which takes the value one if the linear relationship holds
and otherwise takes the va.lue zero. Then the second term of f(in can be written as
follows:
But the inner integral of this expression can only take the value one or the value zero. 

It takes the value one if and only if 2((d + b)j2 a + M - x Yl/2 - (d + b)>'/2) E 

.53

OO,Yl - >'(d + b)]. We can thus omit this integral if it is assured that the exterior
integral only integrates over values of YI for which the fo11owing relationship holds:
2((d + b)i~ - a +1ft - Yd2 (d + b)>'j2) < YI - >'(d + b) {:} Yl > (d + h)i~ a M
We shall define this bound as VI' Then the second term can fina11y be written as:
The third term of !i.

can be treated similarly to obtain:
Summing up, the density function !(ii,x=O) can thus be written:
In the following figure on the left side, the density functions of ii are plotted in the
specific example a = 10; lliVJ .5; (J'; 1; (J'; = 1; d = 0,5; b 0,5 (for .T

used are 0 (corresponding to the case of unrestricted averaging); 0.25; 0..5; 0.7.5; 1; 2; 8
(corresponding practically to the case of no averaging). As in the case of a limitation of
the reserve balance, the variance of ii generated by the transitory shocks can be precisely
chosen in the range given by the two extreme arrangements of no averaging at 0,11 and
unrestricted averaging. The figure on the right side plots the variance of ii with 0, constant
