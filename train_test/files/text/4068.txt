Introduction
Angiotensin II (Ang II) promotes atherosclerosis devel-
opment through type 1 (AT1
) receptor,1­3 which is pre-
sent in a variety of cells, including bone marrow (BM)
cells.4,5 Previous studies have shown that atherosclerosis
development was significantly attenuated in atheroscle-
rosis-prone mice whose BM cells were repopulated with
AT1
-deficient (Agtr1-/-) cells.6 We have also reported
that BM AT1
regulates macrophage-colony-stimulating
factor (M-CSF)-mediated differentiation/proliferation of
BM monocyte-lineage cells followed by the mobiliza-
tion of monocytes, which contribute to AT1
-mediated
pro-atherogenic actions.7 These findings indicate that
BM AT1
plays a crucial role in the development of
atherosclerosis; however, the effect of BM Ang II type 2
(AT2
) receptor on atherogenesis remains to be defined.

Abstract
Background: Bone marrow (BM) Angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 (AT1
) receptor plays a crucial role in atherosclerosis
development; however, the effect of BM Ang II type 2 (AT2
) receptor on atherogenesis remains undefined.
Methods and results: We generated BM chimera apoE-deficient (apoE-/-) mice whose BM cells were repopulated
with AT2
-deficient (Agtr2-/-) or wild-type (Agtr2+/+) cells. After 2 months of a high-cholesterol diet, the atherosclerotic
lesion area was significantly increased in the apoE-/-/BM-Agtr2-/- mice compared with the apoE-/-/BM-Agtr2+/+ mice (51%,
P < 0.05), accompanied by an augmented accumulation of lesion macrophages. Although phenotypic polarization in
BM-derived macrophages and lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines in thioglycollate-
induced peritoneal macrophages (TGPMs) were not affected by AT2
-deficiency, mRNA and protein expression levels of
macrophage liver X receptor  (LXR) were significantly decreased in Agtr2-/- TGPMs compared with Agtr2+/+ TGPMs.
Anti-inflammatory effects of LXR agonist (GW3965) were markedly inhibited in Agtr2-/- TGPMs. Furthermore, the
expression levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1 and CCR7 were much lower in Agtr2-/- TGPMs than
Agtr2+/+ TGPMs, accompanied by a significantly reduced cholesterol efflux.
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that BM-AT2
deficiency aggravates atherosclerosis, at least in part, by eliminating
the anti-atherogenic properties of macrophages elicited by LXR activation.

atherosclerosis lesions.8,9 Macrophage phenotypes are
conventionally divided into two broad types, known as
classically activated macrophages (M1), induced by
Th1 cytokines or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and alterna-
tively activated macrophages (M2), induced by Th2
cytokines.10­12 In atherosclerotic plaque, M1 and M2 mac-
rophages are located in a lesion-specific manner, in which
distribution and dominance of M1 and M2 macrophages
are closely implicated with lesion progression and instabil-
ity.11,12 Recently, the AT1
receptor has been reported to
modulate macrophage polarization into M1 macrophages
and to exaggerate renal injury and atherosclerosis.13,14
These findings led us to examine the effect of AT2
on mac-
rophage phenotypic polarization and its functional rele-
vance to the development of atherosclerosis.
In this study, we focused on the effect of the BM-AT2
receptor on macrophage phenotypic alteration and studied
whether (1) BM-AT2
deficiency exaggerates the develop-
ment of hypercholesterolemia-associated atherosclerosis
and (2) BM-AT2
deficiency affects macrophage polariza-
tion and inflammatory response. We also investigated the
underlying mechanism of AT2
-mediated atheroprotective
action. Our results demonstrated for the first time that
BM-AT2
deficiency accelerates the development of athero-
sclerosis, and liver X receptor  (LXR)-mediated anti-
atherogenic actions such as anti-inflammatory response,
cholesterol efflux, and emigration-related gene expression
were attenuated in AT2
-deficient macrophages. Our find-
ings support the notion that direct AT2
activation could be
a potential therapeutic option for preventing the develop-
ment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.
Materials and methods
Animals
ApoE-/- mice (C57BL/6) were obtained from Taconic Co.
Ltd (Germantown, NY, USA) and AT2
receptor-deficient
(Agtr2-/-) mice (C57BL/6) were kindly provided by Dr. M.
Horiuchi (Ehime University). Agtr2-/- mice were crossed
with apoE-/- mice. Heterozygous animals were crossed
until homozygous double knockout (Agtr2-/-/apoE-/-)
mice were obtained (backcrossed more than 10 times).
Two-month-old female apoE-/- recipient mice were
lethally irradiated at 9 Gy using an X-ray source. BM cells
were harvested from the femurs and tibias of donor male
mice (Agtr2-/-/apoE-/- or Agtr2+/+/apoE-/-) by flushing
with RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco BRL), and then recipi-
ents received 5 × 106 BM cells per mouse in 0.2 ml of
medium by tail-vein injection. Two months after BM trans-
plantation, all mice started to receive a high-cholesterol
diet (36% fat, 1.25% cholesterol; OrientalYeast Co., Tokyo,
Japan) for an additional 2 months. The animals were housed
in a room that was maintained at 22°C under a 12-h light/
dark cycle and were provided with drinking water ad libi-
tum. Before the tissues (aortas) were harvested, mice were
euthanized by trans-cardiac perfusion under terminal
anesthesia induced by intraperitoneal administration of
pentobarbital (200 mg/kg). All investigations conformed to
the Guidelines for Animal Experiments of the Kyoto
Prefectural University of Medicine, following approval by
a local university ethics review board.
Hemodynamic analysis
Mean blood pressure and heart rate were measured under
conscious and unrestrained conditions using a programma-
ble sphygmomanometer (BP-98A; Softron, Tokyo, Japan).
Plasma lipid analysis
Total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were
determined using an automated chemistry analyzer (Wako
Chemicals Co., Tokyo, Japan). Low density lipoprotein
(LDL)-cholesterol levels were quantified by an enzymatic
reaction using a commercially available kit (Daiichi Pure
Chemicals Co., Tokyo, Japan).
Quantitative measurement of atherosclerotic
lesions
The mice were euthanized at 24 weeks and the atheroscle-
rotic lesions were analyzed. Image analysis was performed
on Oil Red O-stained aortas using Scion Imaging software
(Informer Technologies, Inc. Shingle Springs, USA). The
aortic lesion area in each animal was measured as a per-
centage of the total aortic area.
Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemical analysis, the aortic root was rap-
idly removed after phosphate buffered saline (PBS) perfu-
sion, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound,
and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The atherosclerotic
lesions in the aortic root region were examined at five loca-
tions at 100-µm intervals, and stained immunohistochemi-
cally with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated
antibodies against monocyte/macrophage antibody-2
(MOMA-2; Serotec, Oxford, UK), and then observed using
a confocal microscope (FLUOVIEW FV300; Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan). As a negative control, non-immune immu-
noglobulin and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies
were used. Positive MOMA-2 staining was evaluated using
image-analysis software. Coverage of the MOMA-2-
stained area as a percentage of the total plaque area was
assessed in five sections from six animals in each group.
Isolation of bone marrow-derived macrophages
(BMDMs) and polarization assay
Primary cultures of bone marrow-derived macrophages
were obtained from femurs and tibias of 8­12-week-old
Agtr2+/+ or Agtr2-/- mice and cultured in complete
938 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
medium (Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supple-
mented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 800 pg/ml mac-
rophage-colonystimulatingfactor-1(20%L-929-conditioned
medium)). Non-adherent cells were collected after 24 h
and were differentiated for seven days, yielding 98%
F4/80+ cells (data not shown). Differentiated bone mar-
row-derived macrophages were polarized with either 100
ng/ml LPS+100 U/ml interferon gamma (IFN) (M1) or 5
ng/ml interleukin-4 (IL-4) (M2).12
Isolation of thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal
macrophages (TGPMs) and lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced inflammatory response
Peritoneal exudate cells were harvested from the perito-
neal cavities of wild-type (Agtr2+/+) and Agtr2-/- mice
four days after an intra-peritoneal injection of 2.0 ml of 3%
sterile thioglycollate medium. After 6 h of incubation,
non-adherent cells were removed. Flow cytometric analy-
sis showed that more than 90% of the adherent cells were
positive for F4/80. After 18 h of incubation, isolated
TGPMs were stimulated by 100 ng/ml of LPS for 6 h.
LXR agonist (GW3965, 2 M) was added 18 h prior to
LPS stimulation.
RNA isolation and real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR)
RNA isolation was performed using the RNeasy mini kit
or RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The
obtained RNAwas reversely transcribed with SuperScriptR
III First-Strand kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative
real time RT-PCR was carried out using a LightCycler
ST300 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) with
LightCycler FastStart DNA Masterplus SYBR Green I kit
(Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). The dis-
sociation curves were monitored to check for aberrant
primer dimer formation. PCR-amplified products were
electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels to confirm the pres-
ence of a single band. Data are expressed as levels relative
to the Agtr2+/+ mice.
Western blotting
TGPMs were harvested and homogenized in Eppendorf
tubes in 100 l of lysis buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8
containing 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (w/v), 10%
glycerol, 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.1% bromophe-
nol blue (w/v)). The cell lysates were sonicated for 2 s,
heated at 95°C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g
for 2 min at 4°C. Small aliquots (20 l) of the supernatants
were subjected to polyacrylamide gel (10%) electrophore-
sis containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) and
then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-P,
Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, USA).
The membrane was then blotted using the LXR antibodies
(LXR: sc-1001; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa
Cruz, USA). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with
an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system
(Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) followed by expo-
sure to Kodak X-ray film.
Flow cytometric analysis
TGPMs were detached from culture plates using cell dis-
sociation buffer (GIBCO BRL, San Francisco, USA) and
analyzed by FACSCalibur (Becton, Dickinson and
Company, Franklin Lakes, USA). The antibodies used for
analysis were PE-conjugated anti-F4/80 (eBioscience, Inc.
San Diego, USA) and PerCP-CyTM5.5-conjugated anti-
CCR7 (Becton, Dickinson and Company).
Cholesterol efflux assay
Peritoneal macrophages were obtained as described above
and cholesterol efflux was evaluated as described previ-
ously.15 After washing, 5 × 105 cells/well were plated on an
eight-well -slide in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium
(DMEM) containing 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 1 U/
ml penicillin/streptomycin and were grown overnight.
Cells were then incubated with NBD-cholesterol (0.35
M) in the above medium containing 2.5% FBS for 1 h at
37°C. Cells were washed twice with Puck's buffer (1 mM
Na2
HPO4
, 0.9 mM H2
PO4
, 5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2
, 0.6
mM MgSO4
, 6 mM glucose, 138 mM NaCl, and 10 mM
HEPES) and placed in serum-free medium. The fluores-
cence-labeled cholesterol released from the cells into the
medium was measured with a multi-label counter.
Cholesterol efflux was evaluated as a percentage of fluo-
rescence in the medium relative to the total amount of
fluorescence (cells and medium), and expressed as levels
relative to the Agtr2+/+ mice.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as means ± standard error (SE). Mean
values were compared using analysis of variance. If a statis-
tically significant effect was found, Scheffe's F test was per-
formed to detect the difference between groups. Values of P
< 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
BM-AT2
deficiency exaggerates atherosclerosis
development in apoE-/- mice
Eight weeks after BM transplantation, 16-week-old chi-
meric mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 2 months.
The atherosclerotic lesion area was significantly larger
in apoE-/-/BM-Agtr2-/- mice than that in apoE-/-/
BM-Agtr2+/+ mice (51%, P < 0.05) (Figure 1(a) and (b)),
Kato et al. 939
accompanied by an augmented accumulation of lesion
macrophages (Figure 1(c) and (d)). Hemodynamic data
(Supplemental Tables 1 and 2) did not differ between the
two groups before and after the high-cholesterol diet. Lipid
profile (Supplemental Table 3) and circulating blood cell
counts (Supplemental Table 4) after 8 weeks of a high-cho-
lesterol diet were also equivalent between the two groups,
suggesting that the BM-AT2
receptor plays a crucial role in
the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis development.
AT2
deficiency has no effect on phenotypic
polarization of BM-derived macrophages
Macrophage phenotype has been conventionally divided
into two classes: inflammatory M1 macrophages and
resident M2 macrophages, induced by IFN- or IL-4,
respectively.12 First, we examined the effect of BM-AT2
on BMDM polarization. The expression levels of M1
markers, such as TNF-, CXCL10, iNOS, and ICAM-1,
were equivalent between the two groups before polariza-
tion. Stimulation with IFN- significantly increased the
expression of M1 markers in both Agtr2+/+ and Agtr2-/-
BMDMs, with no discernible difference between the two
groups except for iNOS gene expression (Figure 2(a)).
Likewise, the expression of M2 markers, such as CD206
and Arg1, was comparable between Agtr2+/+ and Agtr2-/-
BMDMs before and after stimulation with IL-4 (Figure
2(b)), suggesting that BM-AT2
did not affect BMDM
polarization elicited by IFN- or IL-4. We further com-
pared LPS-induced M1 polarization between Agtr2+/+
and Agtr2-/- TGPMs. Flow cytometric analysis showed
no difference in F4/80 expression between Agtr2+/+ and
Agtr2-/- TGPMs (Supplemental Figures 1A and 1B). AT1
receptor mRNA expression levels, as well as F4/80 and
CD68, did not differ between the two groups
(Supplemental Figure 1C). LPS-induced expressions of
inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6,
were significantly elevated in both Agtr2+/+ and Agtr2-/-
TGPMs; however, no significant difference could be
observed between the two groups (Figure 2(c)), suggest-
ing that LPS-induced macrophage polarization was not
affected by AT2
deficiency.
AT2
deficiency remarkably attenuates LXR
expression in TGPMs
Next, we examined the mRNA expression levels of LXR
and LXR, which are a nuclear receptor superfamily of

deficiency exaggerates atherosclerotic lesion formation.

contrast, LXR mRNA expression was modestly, but sig-
nificantly, reduced in Agtr2-/- TGPMs compared with
Agtr2+/+ TGPMs before LPS stimulation (Figure 3(b)).
LXR expression was remarkably increased by LPS treat-
ment in Agtr2+/+ TGPMs; however, it was remarkably inhib-
ited in Agtr2-/- TGPMs. Consistently, the protein expression
levels of LXR also showed a modest, but significant,
decrease in Agtr2-/- TGPMs irrespective of LPS stimulation
(Figure 3(c) and (d)), suggesting that the LXR-associated
signaling pathway was impaired in Agtr2-/- TGPMs.

deficiency eliminates LXR-mediated anti-
inflammatory response
To examine the effect of AT2
deficiency on LXR-mediated
anti-inflammatory response, TGPMs were stimulated by LPS
in combination with or without the LXR agonist GW3965.
Treatment with GW3965 significantly reduced the
LPS-induced mRNA expression levels of TNF-, IL-1, and
IL-6 in Agtr2+/+ TGPMs (Figure 4(a)). In contrast, the anti-
inflammatory effect of GW3965 was attenuated in Agtr2-/-

Agtr2+/+ TGPMs after treatment with GW3965 (Figure 4(c)),
whereas GW3965 treatment had no effect on TNF- protein
levels in Agtr2-/- TGPMs (Figure 4(d)). These findings sug-
gest that the LXR-mediated anti-inflammatory response was
impaired in Agtr2-/- TGPMs.
AT2
deficiency reduces ABCA1 expression and
cholesterol efflux in TGPMs
Next, we examined the effect of AT2
deficiency on ATP-
binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) expression, which
is transcriptionally regulated by LXR.21 ABCA1 mRNA
expression was significantly reduced in Agtr2-/- TGPMs
by 31% compared with Agtr2+/+ TGPMs (Figure 5(a)).
Consistently with this finding, cholesterol efflux was sub-
stantially attenuated in Agtr2-/- TGPMs by 35% (P < 0.05)
(Figure 5(b)), suggesting that the LXR-mediated increase
in ABCA1 expression and its anti-atherogenic properties
were impaired in apoE-/-/BM-Agtr2-/- mice.
AT2
deficiency inhibits CCR7 expression in
TGPMs
We further examined the effect of AT2
deficiency on CCR7
expression, which is up-regulated by LXR activation and
contributes to macrophage emigration from the atheroscle-
rotic lesions.22 CCR7 mRNA expression was substantially
reduced by 58% in Agtr2-/- TGPMs compared with
Agtr2+/+ TGPMs (Figure 6(a)). Flow cytometric analysis
also showed that CCR7 expression levels were signifi-
cantly attenuated in Agtr2-/- TGPMs compared with
Agtr2+/+ TGPMs (Figure 6(b)). These findings suggest that
the AT2
receptor plays a crucial role in macrophage emi-
gration from atherosclerotic plaque lesions.

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that
BM-AT2
deficiency markedly exaggerated atherosclero-
sis development with an augmented accumulation of
lesion macrophages. Although phenotypic polarization of
BM-derived macrophages was not affected by AT2
defi-
ciency, mRNA and protein expression levels of LXR,
which belongs to a nuclear receptor family of ligand-
dependent transcriptional factors exerting anti-atherogenic
properties,16­20 were significantly decreased in AT2
-
deficient TGPMs. While LXR agonist treatment signifi-
cantly inhibited LPS-induced proinflammatory response
in wild-type TGPMs, it was markedly ameliorated in
AT2
-deficient TGPMs. Moreover, mRNA expression lev-
els of ABCA1 and CCR7, transcriptionally up-regulated
by LXR activation,21,22 showed significant decreases in
AT2
-deficient TGPMs, accompanied by markedly
reduced cholesterol efflux. These findings suggest that
LXR-mediated anti-atherogenic action was substan-
tially impaired in BM-AT2
-deficient chimeric mice and
support the notion that direct AT2
activation could be a
potential therapeutic strategy to prevent the development
of atherosclerotic diseases.
Liver X receptors (LXR/), members of the nuclear
receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription fac-
tors, were originally thought to control lipid metabo-
lism.23,24 The LXR isoform is highly expressed in the
liver and plays a dominant role in hepatic lipogenesis,
thereby promoting triglyceride synthesis.24 Considering
that AT2
deficiency has no effect on LXR expression
(Figure 3(a)), the AT2
-mediated antiatherogenic effect
could be exerted without stimulating hepatic lipogenesis.
On the other hand, LXR is ubiquitously expressed and
has been found to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-prolif-
erative effects.25 Levin et al. demonstrated that the ability
of the LXR agonist to inhibit atherosclerosis progression
was lost in mice transplanted with BM lacking macrophage
LXR expression,26 suggesting that macrophage LXR may
be a potential therapeutic target to prevent atherosclerosis
development. Moreover, LXR activation has been
reported to increase the expression of ABCA-1 and CCR7
in macrophages, which are closely implicated with choles-
terol efflux and macrophage emigration from atheroscle-
rotic plaque lesions.21,22 Systemic administration of the
LXR agonist has been reported not only to inhibit athero-
sclerosis progression but also to cause regression of estab-
lished atherosclerotic lesions.26,27 Since the mRNA and

protein expression levels of CCR7 decreased in AT2
-
deficient TGPMs, AT2
-mediated anti-atherogenic action is
likely to be involved in the regression of atherosclerotic
plaques by augmenting emigration of monocytes/mac-
rophages from atherosclerotic lesions.
The underlying mechanism of AT2
-mediated regulation
of LXR gene expression remains to be elucidated. The AT2
receptor has been shown to be associated with the activation
of a series of phosphatases, including protein tyrosine phos-
phatase SHP-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase phos-
phatase-1 (MKP-1), and serine/threonine phosphatase 2A
(PP2A).28­32 In silico analysis of promoter sequences identi-
fied the binding sites of NFATC2, a transcriptional factor of
the Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) superfamily,
in the LXR promoter region (data not shown). While phos-
phorylated NFATC2 is located in the cytoplasm, dephospho-
rylated NFATC2 moves into the nucleus and binds to the
promoter region to regulate gene expression.33 Interestingly,
AT2
activation has been demonstrated to induce diphospho-
rylation of NFATC2 and promote the binding of NFATC2 to
the eNOS promoter region, resulting in increased eNOS
expression in rat cardiomyocytes.34 These findings suggest
thatAT2
-mediated dephosphorylation of NFATC2 is likely to
enhance its binding to the LXR promoter region, leading to
increased expression of LXR.
LXR activation has been reported to lessenAT1
expression
via dephosphorylation of Sp1.35 Likewise, Takata et al.
reported that ABCA1 gene expression was inhibited via AT1
activation.36 To exclude the possibility that augmented
inflammatory response and reduced gene expression of
ABCA1inAT2
-deficientTGPMscanbeattributedtoincreased
AT1
activation, we examinedAT1
receptor mRNAexpression.
AT1
receptor mRNA expression levels did not differ between
AT2
-deficient and wild-type TGPMs (Supplemental Figure

-mediated anti-atherogenic actions
are not dependent on AT1
-mediated effects.

Recently, compound 21 (C21), a nonpeptide, orally
active, and selective AT2
agonist has been developed.37
Direct AT2
stimulation by C21 has been reported to exert
beneficial effects on cardiac and vascular function in
rodents through an increased production of NO and/or sup-
pression of the inflammatory response.38,39 Rompe et al.
reported that C21 treatment significantly reduced TNF--
induced IL-6 mRNA levels in primary human and murine
dermal fibroblasts.40 They also showed that injection of
bleomycin into murine skin resulted in significantly ele-
vated mRNA expression levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-
, which were markedly reduced by C21 treatment. Our
findings support the notion that AT2
stimulation exerts
anti-atherogenic actions and could be a potential therapeu-
tic strategy for producing a clinically beneficial effect on
the cardiovascular system.
In conclusion, AT2
deficiency in macrophages markedly
inhibited LXR-mediated anti-inflammatory response,
ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux, and migration-related
CCR7 expression. AT2
-mediated regulation of macrophage
LXR expression was mostly attributable to the atheropro-
tective effect of bone marrow AT2
receptor. These findings
provide novel evidence for the bone marrow AT2
-mediated
anti-atherogenic actions and new insight into the mecha-
nism for AT2
-mediated effect on atherosclerosis.
