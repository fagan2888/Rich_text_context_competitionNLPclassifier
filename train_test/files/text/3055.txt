Aspirin Use and Lung, Colon, and Breast Cancer Incidence in a Prospective Study
Dina M. Schreinemachers and Richard B. Everson



A large body of experimental data and several recent epide ­ miologic studies indicate that aspirin use may decrease cancer risk. The experimental studies found effects at many ana­ tomic sites, whereas the epidemiologic studies saw the great ­ est effect on mortality from digestive cancers. To provide further human data, we examined the association between aspirin use and cancer risk using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I (NHANES I) and the NHANES I  Epidemiologic  Follow-up  Studies (NH EFS). Characterization of aspirin use was based on ques­
tions in the baseline interview asking whether subjects used aspirin during the previous 30 days. Data were available from 12,668 subjects age 25-74, at time of initial examination for

NHANES I, who were followed for an average of 12.4 years. Among these subjects, 1,257 were diagnosed with cancer more than 2 years after their NHANES I examination. Incidence of several cancers was lower among persons who reported aspirin use: the incidence rate ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) for all sites combined were 0.83 (0.74- 0.93), lung cancer 0.68 (0.49-0.94), breast cancer in women
0.70 (0.50-0.96), and colorectal cancer in younger men 0.35 (0.17-0.73). These findings were not readily explained by potentially confounding factors. The data suggest an associ­ ation between aspirin consumption and decreased cancer incidence at several cancer sites. (Epidemiology 1994;5:138- 146)

Aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit carcinogenesis in many experimental systems. Animal studies showed inhibitory effects at numerous anatomic sites, including bladder, breast, colon, esophagus, lung, pancreas, prostate, and uterine

two other clinical trials provide conflicting data on the association between low doses of aspirin and colon cancer risk. One trial, which was designed to examine the effects of nutrient supplements, found that aspirin use was associated with reduced risk of recurrence of large bowel adenomas. 26 Data from the Physicians' Health Study, a randomized clinical trial of aspirin and beta-carotene use, revealed no association between aspirin use and the incidence of colorectal polyps or colorectal cancer. 27 Three epidemiologic studies found that aspirin use was associated with reduced risk of
colon cancer, 28 30 whereas a fourth study did not find th1. s asso. ci.ation. 31·3'· Th un  et a11' a1so recent1y reported
an association between aspirin use and reduced mor­ tality for cancer of the esophagus, stomach, and colon but found no association between aspirin use and  risk at other sites.
  These experimental and human observations, along with our interest in understanding the potential influ­ ence of the prostaglandin synthase pathway on risk from environmental carcinogens, 19 prompted us to examine data from a cohort study based on a stratified probability sample of the U.S. population for associa­ tions between aspirin use and cancer incidence.


Subjects and Methods
THE COHORT
The National Center for Health Statistics  conducted the National Health and Examination Survey I (NHANES I) between 1971 and 1975. NHANES I
collected data from a probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population between the ages of 1 and 74 years. 33 Groups suspected to be at risk for malnutrition were oversampled in this study. The NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Studies (NHEFS) obtained follow-up data on subjects who had undergone a medical examination and were  25-74 years of age at the time ofNHANES I. Data for NHEFS were gathered in several phases as described previ­ ously.34 Procedures included in person and telephone interviews of study subjects or surrogates, obtaining facility records for hospital or nursing home stays, and gathering death certificates. The 1982-1984 follow-up was conducted on 14,407 subjects, age 25-74 at the time of NHANES I. In 1986, the second follow-up included 3,980 subjects age 55 and over at the time of NHANES I. In 1987, the third follow-up included 11,750 subjects age 25-74 at the time of NHANES I. The percentages of proxy interviews for the  1982- 1984, 1986, and 1987 follow-ups were 15, 29, and 11, respectively.


CASE IDENTIFICATION
Subjects with cancer [defined as International Classi­ fication of Diseases (ICD), 9th revision, codes 140-208, excluding ICD 173 (nonmelanoma skin cancer)] were identified at follow-up from interview, hospital record, and death certificate data. For subjects with multiple cancers, only the earliest occurring cancer was in­ cluded. Where data were available from multiple sources, the dates of diagnosis and cancer site code provided by hospital records were used. If a death certificate was the only source of the cancer informa­ tion, the date of death was used for the cancer inci­ dence date in these analyses. Newly diagnosed cancers were reported for 1,488 individuals after the NHANES I examination. Hospital records supporting the diag­ nosis were available for 967; the other 521 subjects were identified from interviews (354), from death cer­ tificates (72), or from both interview and death certifi­ cate data (95).

ASPIRIN USE DATA
The NHANES I baseline interview obtained data on aspirin use by asking subjects whether they had taken aspirin during the 30-day period before the interview, and if yes, how many days before the interview they last took aspirin. By these criteria, 59% of the subjects used aspirin. Of the subjects taking aspirin, 39% took aspirin within the last day and 80% took aspirin within the week before the interview.

POPULATION FOR ANALYSIS
Of the 14,407 subjects age 25-74 who underwent a medical examination and were followed up after NHANES I, a total of 1,888 were reported to have cancer. Of these 1,888 individuals, 400 were excluded because their diagnosis occurred before NHANES I. Because we were concerned that premonitory cancer symptoms could have prompted aspirin use, we ex­ cluded an additional 222 subjects whose cancers were diagnosed 2 years or less after their participation in NHANES I. Of the 12,519 subjects not known to have cancer, we excluded 1,013 subjects because the only source of information on them was an incomplete interview, so that their cancer status could not be defined with certainty. (About 56% of these subjects were aspirin users at enrollment.) Among the remain­ ing subjects, we excluded 95 owing to missing infor­ mation on aspirin use. As a result, 12,668 subjects were available for the analyses, including 1,257 subjects with and 11,411 subjects without cancer. Aspirin use among the subjects with and without cancer was 51 % and




60%, respectively. Overall, subjects were followed for an average of 12.4 person-years.

COVARIATES
We obtained data concerning age, gender , race, edu ­ cation, socioeconomic status, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and arthritis from the  NHANES  I  base­ line interview.  The  poverty  index,  used  as  a  measure of socioeconomic status, was derived from the total income of a household divided by the  income necessary to maintain that household on a nutrition ally adequate food plan. The income used  for  the  divisor  was  based on Census Bureau reports. 35 We defined  body  mass index as weight divided  by  the  square  of  the  height (kg/ m2). Arthritis was considered in the analysis since many subjects with this condition take  aspirin  or  re­ lated medications. Only about half  of  the  question­ naires used for the baseline interview for NHANES I asked for data concerning smoking. Smoking infor­ mation was available from follow-up interviews  and proxy interviews for other subjects, however, and by combining  these  two  sources,  smoking   information was available for 98% of the sub jec ts. These  data sources were used to classify subjects as nonsmokers (ever) or smokers (including current and past smokers). The  percentage  of  smokers  among  aspirin  users  was 56 %, and among nonusers 54%.

ST ATISTICAL METHODS
We calculated person-years for subjects with and with­ out cancer by subtracting the year of the NHANES I examination from, respectively, the year of cancer incidence or the last year the subject was known to be alive and free of cancer. The Mantel-Haenszel method as described by Rothman 36 was used to calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the different cancer sites and all sites combined, stratifying by gender and age at time of NHANES I (<65, 65). For breast cancer, women were stratified by age <50 and 50, which divided the cases more evenly and approximated pre- and postmenopausal forms of the disease. We used the Cox proportional hazards model to analyze several risk factors simulta­ neous ly. For selected cancer sites (all sites, lung, colo­ rectal, and breast), age-adjusted incidence rate differ­ ences (IRD) were calculated using the pooling method described by Rothman .36 Age adjustments used to calculate IRRs and IRDs for these sites grouped data for subjects below age 40 (in whom numbers of cancers were low) and used 5-year strata above age 40. The pooling method was used for IRD calculations because most strata-specific rates appeared sufficiently uniform

to warrant this approach; exceptions are noted in the text. Because the day and month of cancer diagnosis were often missing, these time periods were approxi­ mated using calendar years . All analyses were per­ formed using the SAS statistical package.37

Results
Of the 12,668 subjects for whom follow-up data were available, 7,438 (59 % ) were classified as "exposed," that is, they reported aspirin use within 30 days  of  the baseline interview. During follow-up, 8.6% of aspirin users developed cancer, compared with 11.8% of in­ dividuals who did not report aspirin use.
  Table 1 presents the distribution of several demo­ graphic and potential cancer risk factors by aspirin use in the 30 days before the interview, separately for subjects with and without cancer. Women were more frequent aspirin users than men, aspirin use decreased with increasing age, and people with arthritis (past or current) tended to use  aspirin  more.  The  proportion of subjects who used aspirin was lower for subjects with cancer than subjects without cancer,  at all levels of each factor. Table 2 presents the relative risk for cancer in terms of the IRR and 95% CI for several cancer categories and individual sites, adjusted for gender and age. Aspirin use was associated with a reduced risk overall and at several cancer sites, includ­ ing lung, breast, colorectal, pancreatic, and kidney cancer, as well as leukemia.
Data presented  in Table  2 were based on  all identi­
fied cancers, including cases identified from hospital records, death certificates, and interviews. For 306 of the 1,257 cases, information on cancer  was  reported by the subjects during the interview and was not confirmed by the medical records or death certificates. We also analyzed the data excluding these 306 subjects. The risk estimates changed little in this analysis; for example, the IRR (and 95% C I) for all cancer sites combined  was 0.83 (0.73-0.94); for cancer of the lung,
0.70  (0.50-0.98);  and  for   breast  cancer   in  women,
0.66 (0 .46-0.95). Because of the consistency of the data, these 306 subjects were retained in subsequent analyses.
  To refine understanding of the age and gender  groups involved in the decrease in risk for cancer among aspirin users, we present in Table 3 incidence rates and effect estimates calculated using the Mantel­ Haenszel approach for all sites combined and for the three cancer sites with the largest number of cases, stratified by gender and age, and adjusted using 5-year age inte rvals. For all cancer sites combined , aspirin use was associated with reduction in risk among men

of all ages. The reduction was  greatest  among  men age less than 65 years old at the time of NHANES I (IRR= 0.67; 95% CI= 0.53-0.84). Younger men also showed a marked reduced risk for colorectal cancer (IRR= 0.35; 95% CI= 0.17-0.73), which was not the case for older men or for women. Aspirin use was associated with decreased lung cancer risk for men (IRR  =  0.55; 95% CI  =  0.38-0.82) but  showed no
evidence of a preventive effect among women (IRR = 1.40; 95% CI = 0.74-2.66). For women less than 50 years of age at the time of NHANES I, aspirin use was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (IRR =
0.54 
; 95% CI = 0.33-0.89). This reduction was less pronounced in women 50 years and older (IRR = 0.89; 95% CI= 0.58-1.37).
  Data for the four cancer site-gender-age groups showing the strongest association with aspirin were further investigated in proportional hazards models controlling for possible confounding factors (Table 4). The groups included: all cancer sites in men of all ages; lung cancer in men of all ages; colorectal cancer  in men under 65 years of age; breast cancer in women under 50 years of age. All models included age by single year and either one risk factor at a time (data not

shown) or combinations of these risk factors. Smoking and alcohol use increased risk for cancer at all sites combined and for lung cancer; being white increased risk for colorectal cancer; and having more education increased the risk of breast cancer. We excluded pov­ erty index, body mass index, and arthritis  from Table 4, because they did not seem to contribute to the models. Although controlling for risk factors did little to change the aspirin effect, the association of several of these factors with cancer risk at particular sites is of interest in itself, and it affirms the general consistency of these data with widely known risk factors. In addi­ tion, the other site and gender  breakdowns  presented in both Tables 2 and 3 were further analyzed using proportional hazards models, controlling for age by single year . Results differed little from stratified anal­ yses (data not presented).
Table 3 presents the IRD per 1,000 person-years for

the sites showing the stronger associations, and Figure 1 presents the IRD per 1,000 person-years between aspirin users and nonusers for three time periods after NHANES I, by cancer site and gender. In general, the incidence rate difference in men is larger than in women, and it is larger at 7-10 years after NHANES I than during the other two time periods. The age­ specific rates (not shown) varied substantially in the analysis of all cancer site data in which young males were included. This variability resulted in differences between the crude and age-adjusted IRD presented for this group in Table 3. For example, if men under  age 40 (who had very low rates) were excluded from the analysis for men under 65, the adjusted IRD would be
- 3.75 per 1,000 person-years instead of the - 1.00 reported in Table 3.
  We examined the data for evidence of dose-response effects among aspirin users. The initial questionnaire

Discussion
The reduced incidence of cancer associated with aspi­ rin in this cohort was remarkable in view of the relatively crude assessment of aspirin use, which was based on intake during the month before the initial interview for NHANES I. This question has the

asked individual s who reported aspirin use in the last 30 days how many days it was sin ce their last use of aspirin . Assuming that subjects who had taken aspirin recently were more frequent users than  those  who took aspirin several weeks ago, information from this question was used as a measure of dose. The data gave no indication of a dose-response effect : among 3,702 subjects who had used aspirin in the last 3- 30 days, 297 (8 %) developed cancer, whereas among 3,736 sub­ jects who took aspirin in the last 0-2 days, 345 (9%) developed cancer. Using days-since-aspirin-use as a continuous variable in models confirmed the lack of effect of this measure of dose.
  We determined the concordance  between  aspirin use at the 1971-1975 baseline and 1982-1984 follow­ up inte rviews. Different questions were used for each interview . The baseline interview asked whether aspi­ rin was used during the previous 30 days, whereas the 1984 follow-up asked whether aspirin was ever taken regularly at least onc e every week. Some 59% of subjects reported using aspirin in response to the question used for baseline interview, whereas 28 % would be classified as aspirin users according to the question used at follow -up. Among subjects inte r­ viewed personally in both studies, 30% of the subjects who reported aspirin use at the baseline interview also reported a history of regular use at follow -up, whereas 15% who denied use at baseline reported a history of regular use at follow-up. In principle, we could have used the 1982-1984 follow-up study as a baseline for aspirin use and obtained information on cancer diag­ nosed after 1984 from the 1986 and 1987 follow -up

strength of being objective and relying on recent mem­ ory, but reported aspirin use could have been influ­ enced by minor illness preceding the study and may have changed over time. Since misclassification is apt to change study results toward the  null, estimates  of the reduction in cancer incidence associated with as­ pirin use are likely to be underestimated as a co nse­ quence of these errors in exposure classification .
  Two further observations from the NHEFS data temper support for a potentially protective effect of aspirin use, however . One is the lack of consistency in effects among different gender and age groups . This apparent inconsistency , however , may reflect the large variability in risk estimates based on the small numbers of subjects. The other is the lack of a dose-response effect among aspirin users. Since exposure was meas­ ured for only 1 month before interview, and misclas­ sification was probabl y high, conditions for demon­ strating a dose-response association were not favorable. Our data and the apparent effectiveness of infrequent aspirin use found by others 12 29 (a decreased mortality risk for colon cancer from aspirin use less than  once per mont h) as well as the relatively long duration of several biologic effects of aspirin (in cluding its covalent binding to prostaglandin synthase) lend some biologic plausibility to the idea of an effect associated with infrequent use.11
  We are not aware of reports of cohort studies in­ cluding a wide age range of subjects that investigated the effec ts of aspirin use on the incidence of a broad range of human cancers. Rosenberg et a/3° reported that initial analyses of a case-control study which in­ cluded several cancer sites showed reduced risk only for colon cancer, with the strongest effects among men
under 60 years of age. Kune et al28  found  a decreased
risk of colon cancer among aspirin users of  both genders . Thun et al12 29 recently reported data from a large prospective study indicating that aspirin use was associated with decreased risk of mortality from cancer

of the esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum. Whereas relative risks for all cancers combined tended to be lower for aspirin users, aspirin use had little impact on mortality from lung or breast cancer in their study. Although their study was based on a  much larger sample than ours, it differed in that aspirin use data were missing from a large portion of their study population, only mortality data were obtained for fol­ low-up, and, as discussed below, the duration of follow­ up was much shorter. In contrast to these reports, Paganini-Hill et al, 32 in a cohort study of members of  a retirement community, did not observe an inverse association between aspirin use and colon cancer risk. Their report also failed to observe an association of aspirin use with colon or lung cancer but reported an increased risk for kidney cancer.
  Some of the discrepancy among studies could result from differences in age of the individuals studied  or the length of follow-up. The largest relative effects in our study generally occurred among younger subjects. The age of subjects in our study (mean 49 years) was
lower  than  those  in  the   studies  of  Paganini-Hill  et

and Thun et a l12 29 (mean 57 years), so that effects most evident among younger subjects might be seen only in our study. As demonstrated in Figure 1, at most sites, the greatest absolute effects were observed in our study at 7-10 years follow-up. The temporal pattern of ex­ posures is complex, however, as individuals may have used aspirin for varying periods before or after the initial interview. Nonetheless, the length of follow-up was less than 6 years for the  study  reported  by Thun et al12 29
ported by Gann et a l.27 Finally, given the complex biologic effects of NSAIDs, temporal or dose-response relations governing risk may differ for different tissues, leading to inconsistent effects.
Fortunately, several data sources should be available
to study further the association between cancer inci­ dence and use of aspirin. These data  sources  include an ongoing extension of the NHEFS itself, other co­ hort studies, and trials investigating the efficacy of aspirin therapy for vascular conditions or chemopre­ vention. In this regard, data presented in the  analysis  of a trial of aspirin among British male doctors reported by Peto et al38 is of interest: doctors randomized to
aspirin use had 18% lower mortality rates from all cancer and 36% lower mortality rates from lung cancer than controls. The findings from this clinical trial appear to parallel those in this analysis of the NHANES I cohort.
