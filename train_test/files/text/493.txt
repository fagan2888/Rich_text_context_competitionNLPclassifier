Background In 2008, motor vehicle occupant deaths in the
USA declined to their lowest level in the last three decades,
while motorcyclist deaths increased to an all time high, more
than doubling in the last 10 years.
Objectives To estimate the number of emergency depart-
ment (ED)-treated non-fatal motorcyclist injuries in the USA
between 2001 and 2008, describe important characteristics of
these injuries, compare rates of non-fatal to fatal injury, and
project the number of ED-treated motorcyclist injuries that
may be observed in 2010 and 2020.
Methods Data were obtained from the National Electronic
Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program for the years

2001 through 2008. Injuries were categorised by body part
primarily affected, primary diagnoses, and ED discharge dis-
position. Weighted estimates and rates were calculated, and
linear regression was used to estimate the number of future
motorcycle injuries.
Results Between 2001 and 2008, an estimated 1 221 690
persons were treated in a USA ED for a non-fatal motorcy-
cle injury. The highest injury and death rates occurred in the
20足24-year-old age group. Motorcycle death rates increased
50% from 1.29 per 100 000 persons in 2001 to 1.94 per 100 000
persons in 2008. ED-treated non-fatal motorcyclist injuries
also displayed an increasing trend, and preliminary projections
indicate these injuries may nearly double again from 170 000
to 320 000 annual injuries between 2008 and 2020 given cur-
rent trends.
Discussion Reversing the increasing trend of motorcyclist
injury, death and cost across the USA will take a concerted
effort among traffic safety and public health practitioners, the
medical community and policymakers.
