Abstract
Repetitive prestimulation, in the form of click trains, is known to alter a wide range of cognitive
and perceptual judgments. To date, no research has explored whether click trains also influence
subjective preferences. This is plausible because preference is related to perceptual fluency and
clicks may increase fluency, or, because preference is related to arousal and clicks may increase
arousal. In Experiment 1, participants heard a click train, white noise, or silence through
headphones and then saw an abstract symmetrical pattern on the screen for 0.5, 1, or 1.5 s.
They rated the pattern on a 7-point scale. Click trains had no effect on preference ratings,
although patterns that lasted longer were preferred. In Experiment 2, we again presented a
click train, silence, or white noise but included both symmetrical and random patterns.
Participants made both a duration and a preference judgment on every trial. Auditory click
trains increased perceived duration, and symmetrical patterns were perceived as lasting longer
than random patterns. Again there was no effect of auditory click trains on preference, and again
patterns that were presented for longer were preferred. We conclude that click trains alter
perceptual and cognitive processes, but not preferences. This helps clarify the nature of the
click train effect and shows which predictions implicit in the existing literature are supported.

Introduction
Past investigations have shown that auditory click trains (repetitive auditory signals at about
5 Hz) alter subsequent processing (Jones, 2014). Tones or visual presentations are judged as
longer in duration when preceded by click trains than silence (Droit-Volet, 2010; Droit-Volet
& Wearden, 2002; Penton-Voak, Edwards, Percival, & Wearden, 1996; Treisman, Faulkner,
Naish, & Brogan, 1990; Wearden, Philpott, & Win, 1999). More recently, it has been shown
that magnitude estimations for various dynamic displays are also increased by the prior
presentation of click trains (Droit-Volet, 2010), and that click trains increase the subjective
velocity of moving stimuli (Makin et al., 2012; Makin, Lawson, Bertamini, & Pickering,
2014). Click trains have also been shown to enhance wider cognitive processing: Jones,
Allely, and Wearden (2011) demonstrated that click trains can increase the amount of
mental arithmetic that can be completed within a given duration, and the number of items
recalled from a rapid digit presentation.
Cognitive timing mechanisms have been modeled and tested extensively, and the effect of click
trains on subjective duration has been considered within these frameworks. According to Scalar
Expectancy Theory, specific clock, memory, and decision modules produce timed behavior. The
clock has subcomponents: a pacemaker that emits ``ticks'' at regular intervals and an accumulator,
which stores the number of ticks. When time becomes task relevant, a switch closes and ticks begin
accumulating (Buhusi & Meck, 2005; Gibbon, Church, & Meck, 1984; Wearden, 1991). Let's
briefly consider an example from a typical cognitive timing task. On each trial, the participant is
presented with a test duration, and then they estimate whether it was longer or shorter than a well-
learned standard duration that they have memorized. The pacemaker emits ticks, say at 10Hz.
When the onset of the test stimulus is detected, the switch closes, and ticks start passing from the
pacemaker into the accumulator. When the offset of the test stimulus is detected, the switch opens,
and the accumulation process is terminated. The final number of ticks in the accumulator is
proportional to an elapsed duration. This can then be compared with the number of ticks
associated with the standard duration in memory, and the decision is made.
The rate at which the pacemaker emits ticks is thought to be arousal sensitive, with greater
arousal producing faster output and longer perceptions of duration (Meck, 1983). Indeed,
arousing stimuli, such as fear-inducing images (Droit-Volet & Meck, 2007), pain (Ogden,
Moore, Redfern, & McGlone, 2015), drugs (Meck, 1983), and increases in body temperature
(Wearden & Penton-Voak, 1995), elongate subjective duration. One possibility, therefore, is
that click trains produce arousal, leading to an increase in pacemaker speed, and a longer
perceived duration for the stimulus that follows them (Treisman et al., 1990).
An alternative suggestion is that click trains speed up the rate at which information is
processed (Jones et al., 2011). It is possible that duration estimates are based on the amount
of information processed within an interval (Kanai, Paffen, Hogendoorn, & Verstraten,
2006). Therefore, the effect of clicks on subjective duration could be mediated by effect of
clicks on information processing rate. Click trains may produce a driven alpha rhythm across
many brain areas, and this could be responsible for subsequent alterations in information
processing rate (see Jones et al., 2011 for discussion).
While the effect of click trains on subjective duration and other perceptual judgments is
well documented, no research to date has explored whether clicks also influence subjective
preferences. The idea that click trains could have an effect on preference is plausible. One
possibility is that clicks influence preference directly (in the same sense that they putatively
increase pacemaker speed directly).
However, the effect of clicks on preference could also be mediated indirectly. The
influential fluency hypothesis states that people are sensitive to the efficiency and speed of
2 i-Perception 0(0)
their own perceptual and cognitive processes. The feeling of high-processing fluency has
positive hedonic tone, and this can be attributed to the goodness of the stimuli under
some circumstances (Reber, 2012). Clicks increase the amount of information processed
within a duration (Jones et al., 2011), and this enhanced information processing could be
akin to higher fluency. The greater fluency could then increase liking, as has been repeatedly
observed. Another pathway is through arousal. It has long been proposed that arousal is
related to preference (Berlyne, 1971). If clicks increase arousal (as proposed by Treisman
et al., 1990), then they could also alter preferences. In sum, there are at least three
nonexclusive mechanisms by which clicks could alter preferences (directly, through fluency,
or arousal), but the basic effect has never been demonstrated.
Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we presented different auditory stimuli (click trains, silence, or white noise)
followed by checkerboards with a symmetrical configuration. We chose symmetrical stimuli
because they are appealing (e.g., Makin, Pecchinenda, & Bertamini, 2012), and this could
make participants engage with the preference task. We asked participants to rate preference
on a 1- to 7-point scale (1 ¼ unattractive to 7 ¼ attractive).
We manipulated the complexity of the patterns by varying the size and number of
elements, and the duration of the patterns by varying exposure (0.5, 1, or 1.5 s; Figure 1).
This had the advantage of adding variability to the stimuli, but also it allowed us to explore
possible interactions between sound type and other features that could alter preference. The
effects of complexity, order, and arousal on aesthetics preference have been well studied
(although many questions remain, for a recent review see van Tonder & Spehar, 2013), so
it is possible that the effect of clicks on preference could be moderated by complexity or
duration of the patterns in a systematic way. Experiment 1 allowed us to explore these
possibilities.
Method
Participants. Forty-two participants took part in the experiment (age range 17­55; 39 right
handed; 30 females), and all had normal or corrected to normal vision. They provided a
written consent for taking part and received a reimbursement for their time or course credits.
The experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Liverpool and
was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2008).
Stimuli and apparatus. Participants sat in a quiet room at approximately 57 cm of distance from
the screen. The sounds were played through Labtec LCS-1021 loud speakers. The visual
stimuli were presented on a 1280 Â 1024 DELL M993s 1900 cathode ray tube monitor at
60 Hz. The auditory stimuli consisted of three different sounds played for 4 s prior to the
visual pattern: click trains (5 Hz, 16 bits), white noise (16 bits), and silence, the latter was
delimitated by two separate clicks (start and end). We included the white noise condition as a
control because click trains may have a specific effect or simply act like a strong warning cue
that the trial is about to start (Penton-Voak et al., 1996). Previous work has repeatedly
demonstrated that prestimulus click trains of this type alter subjective duration and other
perceptual judgments, even when the clicks are not attended (e.g., Droit-Volet, 2010; Jones
et al., 2011; Penton-Voak et al, 1996; Wearden et al., 1999).
The stimuli were created in Psychopy software (Peirce, 2007). The visual stimuli consisted
of a matrix (320 Â 320 px; $10 Â 10degrees of visual angle) with a number of black or white
Palumbo et al. 3
squares ranging from 25 (5 Â 5) to 900 (30 Â 30). Position of checks was assigned as to form
reflectional symmetry around a vertical axis. The symmetric configuration of the items
changed from pattern to pattern, whereas the black and white ratio was the same as to
keep luminance and surface area constant (Figure 1). This means that the size of the items
was inversely related to numerosity. There were six types of matrices, the difference in
numerosity served as a measure of complexity (see Figure 1(a)).
Experimental design and procedure. We employed a 3 Â 3 Â 6 within-subjects design with as
factors sound (clicks, white noise, silence), duration (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 s), and visual complexity
(5 Â 5, 10 Â 10, 15 Â 15, 20 Â 20, 25 Â 25, 30 Â 30 items). The dependent variable was the
attractiveness judgment.
The experiment started with the instructions followed by the practice (six trials presented
in random order across participants). As in previous studies, participants were instructed to
attend to all experimental events but were not instructed to specifically process the clicks
themselves (e.g., see Droit-Volet & Wearden, 2002; Jones et al., 2011; Makin, et al., 2012;
Makin et al., 2014). Each trial started with a black fixation cross at the center of a gray
background, while one of the three sounds was played for 4 s. After the sound, there was a
randomized 0.5 to 1 s delay before the pattern appeared. The symmetric pattern was
displayed for one of the three possible durations (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 s). After this, the 7-point

scale, ranging from unattractive (1) to attractive (7), appeared on the bottom of the screen.
Participants provided response by a mouse click on the scale (see Figure 1(b)).
The practice was followed by 6 blocks of 18 experimental trials, each one of which were
identical to the practice with the exception that novel patterns were presented. Participants
were encouraged to take a break at the end of each block. The experiment lasted
approximately 30 min.
Analysis. Mean preference estimates were obtained in each condition for each participant.
These data points were then analyzed with a three factor repeated measures analysis of
variance (ANOVA). The Greenhouse-Geisser correction factor was applied, when the
assumption of sphericity was violated. We report partial Z2 values following significant
effects.
Results
The results are illustrated in Figure 2. Sound type had no effect on preference judgments,
F(2, 82) ¼ .645, p ¼ .527, Figure 2(a). There was a significant main effect of duration,
F(1.65, 67.76) ¼ 4.33, p ¼ .023, 2
p
¼ .096, Figure 1(b), because patterns were liked more
when they stayed on screen for a longer time (0.5 vs. 1.0 s: t(41) ¼ 3.300, p ¼ .002; 0.5 vs.
1.5 s: t(41) ¼ 2.063, p ¼ .045, Figure 2(b)). There was no main effect of complexity, F(1.23,
5.43) ¼ 1.325, p ¼ .255, Figure 2(c).
There was no Sound Â Complexity interaction, no Sound Â Duration interaction no
Complexity Â Duration interaction: (p > .059 in all cases). However, the three-way
interaction between Sound Â Visual Complexity Â Duration was significant, F(11.33,
464.56) ¼ 2.865, p ¼ .001, 2
p
¼ .065. As shown in Figure 2(h), there were a range of
different two-factor interactions, some of which were significant. Rather than list all these,
we consider the broader research question. Is there a particular subset of conditions where
clicks have a systematic effect on preference? The answer is no. There is no clear case where
preference ratings in the clicks condition diverge from the other two sound conditions.
Discussion
Auditory click trains alter several subsequent perceptual magnitude judgments (Droit-Volet,
2010; Jones, 2014). We tested whether click trains would also alter preference for abstract
symmetrical patterns. This potential effect on preference could be mediated directly, through
increases in perceptual fluency, or through increased arousal. However, contrary to our
predictions, we found that auditory click trains had no influence on preference for
symmetrical patterns. There was a three-way interaction between sound type, duration,
and complexity. However, there was clearly no subset of conditions in which clicks had a
unique effect on preference. This suggests that the effect of click trains is specific to perceptual
and cognitive processes, and that clicks do not alter evaluations, either directly or indirectly.
In Experiment 1, we only obtained preference judgments and just assumed that click
trains were having their usual effect on perceptual and cognitive processing. In Experiment
2, we verified that click trains were indeed having the expected effect on duration by
obtaining both duration and preference judgments on every trial. This rules out a
potential explanation for our null results in Experiment 1; it could be that click trains
atypically failed to alter perceptual processes; hence, changes in preference which would
have been mediated by the altered perceptual processing failed to occur. Another possible
explanation for the null effect of clicks on preference in Experiment 1 was that we only

presented symmetrical stimuli, which are generally evaluated favorably. This could have
masked the effect of click trains.
The only significant main effect in Experiment 1 was that of duration. Participants liked
less the symmetrical stimuli presented for 0.5 s compared with those presented for 1 or 1.5 s
(Figure 2(b)). In Experiment 2, we reexamined this in more detail. Experiment 2 compared
symmetrical and random patterns. It is well known that symmetry is preferred to random,
and this has been shown with explicit ratings measures like those used in Experiment 1
(Eisenman, 1967; Eysenk, 1941; Jacobsen, 2002) and with implicit measures of preference
(Bertamini, Makin, & Pecchinenda, 2013; Makin et al., 2012). There are many, nonexclusive
reasons why people like symmetry, including sexual selection (Grammer, Fink, Møller, &
Thornhill, 2003), visual relevance (Machilsen, Pauwels, & Wagemans, 2009), or high-
perceptual fluency (Makin et al., 2012). Why, then, did longer presentation durations
increased preference for symmetry in Experiment 1? One explanation is that there was
more time for positive evaluations and associations to form. Experiment 2 tested whether
this effect is specific to symmetry. It could be that longer durations would enhance the
difference between symmetry and random, so the preferred symmetry looks better, and the
disliked random patterns look worse. Alternatively, longer presentation durations could lead
to more positive evaluations in general, both for symmetry and random.
Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, the auditory stimulation (click trains, silence, or white noise) was followed
by the presentation of symmetric or random patterns, which stayed on screen for one of five
different durations (0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 s). We asked participants to perform two tasks on
every trial. They both judged the appeal of the pattern and its duration. We expected that
overall, symmetrical patterns would be preferred over the random ones. On the basis of the
results of Experiment 1, we also predicted that preference for symmetrical patterns would
increase with longer presentation durations. However, we did not know whether this would
generalize to random patterns.
On the basis of the results of Experiment 1, we did not expect clicks to have any effect on
preference in the symmetrical condition. There may, however, be an effect of click trains in
the random condition. On the basis of extensive previous literature, we did expect click trains
to increase perceived duration. This would suggest that the null effect in Experiment 1 could
not be attributed to the unusual absence of an influence of click trains on perceptual
processes. Complexity was not manipulated in Experiment 2. Every pattern was a 10 Â 10
black and white matrix (Figure 3). Our previous work shows that this kind of image
complexity has no effect on subjective duration (Palumbo, Ogden, Makin, & Bertamini,
2014).
Method
Participants. Twenty-four participants took part in the experiment (age range 19­25; 2 left
handed; 19 females), and all had normal or corrected to normal vision. They provided a
written consent for taking part and received a reimbursement for their time or course credits.
The experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Liverpool and
was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2008).
Stimuli and apparatus. The auditory stimuli were the same as in Experiment 1 (5 Hz clicks,
white noise and silence presented for 4 s). Stimuli consisted of a matrix with 10 Â 10 squares
Palumbo et al. 7
(320 Â 320 px, each square 32 Â 32 px). Position of the squares formed a vertical reflection or
a random configuration (Figure 3(a)).
Experimental design and procedure. We employed a 3 Â 2 Â 5 within-subjects design with as
factors sound (clicks vs. white noise vs. silence), regularity (symmetry vs. random) and
duration (0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5 s).
The experiment started with the instructions followed by the practice (six trials). As in
Experiment 1, each trial started with a black fixation cross, showed at the center of a gray
background, while one of the three sounds was played for 4 s. After the sound, there was a
randomized 0.5 to 1 s delay before the pattern appeared. Following this, the pattern was
displayed for one of the five possible durations. Participants estimated pattern duration by
selecting with a mouse click one on a 7-point scale (1 ¼ short to 7 ¼ long). As in Experiment 1,
they performed the preference task selecting one option on the 7-point scale (1 ¼ unattractive
to 7 ¼ attractive, Figure 3(b)). The order of the duration and preference ratings was
counterbalanced across participants. Four blocks of 30 experimental trials, presented in a
randomized order, followed the practice. The experimental trials were identical to the practice
ones with the exception that novel patterns were shown. The experiment lasted
approximately 45 min.
Results
Duration estimates. The effects for subjective duration are illustrated in Figure 4. We found
that regularity altered subjective duration. Symmetry was judged to have lasted longer than

random patterns, F(1, 23) ¼ 5.332, p ¼ .028, 2
p
¼ .194, Figure 4(a). Unsurprisingly, there was
significant main effect of duration, F(1.24, 28.52) ¼ 79.28, p ¼ .000, 2
p
¼ .775, because our
participants could estimate duration reasonably accurately (Figure 4(b)). There was also a
main effect of sound, F(2, 46) ¼ 3.81, p ¼ .029, 2
p
¼ .142, Figure 4(c). As expected, patterns
that followed the train of clicks were judged as lasting longer, then the patterns that followed
the silence, t(23) ¼ 3.31, p ¼ .003. Although there was no difference between silence and white
noise, t(23) ¼ 1.699, p ¼ .103, there was also no difference between clicks and white noise,
t(23) ¼ 0.732, p ¼ .472. Therefore, clicks did not have a unique effect on subjective duration,
as predicted by previous work. There were no interaction effects (p > .167 in all cases). This is
important because it indicates that there were no differences in the slope relating duration to
estimated duration in any conditions.
Preferences. Preference results are shown in Figure 5. There was a main effect of regularity,
F(1, 23) ¼ 80.79, p ¼ .000, 2
p
¼ .778, Figure 5(a), because symmetric patterns were liked more
than random patterns. The main effect of duration was also significant, F(4, 92) ¼ 6.613,
p ¼ .000, 2
p
¼ .223 because preference increased with duration Figure 5(b). As in
Experiment 1, there was no main effect of sound on preference, F(1.31, 30.18) ¼ 0.068,
p ¼ .860, Figure 5(c). The preference for longer presentation durations was found in both
symmetry and random conditions: There was no Regularity Â Duration interaction,
F(4, 92) ¼ 0.955, p ¼ .420. This suggests that longer presentation durations do not amplify
preexisting valence but make both positive and negative stimuli seem slightly more positive.
Finally, the three-way interaction between sound, regularity, and duration was also
significant, F(8, 184) ¼ 3.138, p ¼ .002, 2
p
¼ .120. The overall effect of preference for
symmetry over random was the dominant effect in all three sound conditions, and at all
levels of duration, with some relatively minor fluctuations (Figure 5(d) to (f)). However, there
were disparate interactions between sound and duration in the symmetry and random
conditions, which is shown in Figure 5(g) and (h). As with Experiment 1, there was no
clear subset of conditions where clicks altered preference systematically. Instead,
preference ratings from the clicks condition generally lay among those of the silence and
white noise conditions. Figure 5(g) and (h) shows that the increase in preference with
duration was present in most conditions but was not found in the silence-symmetry
condition or in the white noise-random condition.
Discussion
Experiment 2 showed that prior presentation of click trains increased subjective duration, at
least compared with silence. This replicates all previous work in this area (Droit-Volet, 2010;
Jones et al., 2011; Penton-Voak et al., 1996; Treisman et al., 1990). As with Experiment 1,
there was no effect of auditory stimulation on preference. Experiment 2 thus shows
dissociation between the effect of clicks on time perception and the effect of clicks on
preference, even though there are theoretical reasons to expect a similar pattern of results
in both cases.
In Experiment 1, we found that longer presentations led to higher preference ratings:
Experiment 2 replicated this effect and showed that it was common to both the preferred
symmetrical patterns and the disliked random patterns. Therefore, long durations did not
exaggerate existing preferences, but rather increased liking in both. Preference for symmetry
over random far outweighed the much smaller effect of duration. This is unsurprising:
Symmetry is routinely found to be a very strong predictor of explicit and implicit
preference for abstract patterns (Makin et al., 2012).

There were two unexpected findings involving subjective duration. In most experiments,
the absolute size of the click train influence grows with stimulus duration. In other words, the
slope of the relationship between actual duration and estimated duration is usually steeper in
the click train condition than the silence condition. This is often explained by the idea that
clicks increase the pacemaker speed in a pacemaker-accumulator clock (Penton-Voak et al.,
1996). However, we did not find these slope effects on duration estimates in Experiment 2.
Although slope effects are typically observed following click trains, and a recent study by
Jones and Ogden (2015) also only observed an additive effect of clicks, indicating that slope
effects may not be ubiquitous. Second, there was no significant difference between click trains
and white noise. In previous work, the effect of clicks has been shown to be significantly
greater than white noise, while white noise is similar to silence (Makin et al., 2012; Penton-
Voak et al., 1996). This casts some doubt on the reliability of previous work on click trains
and temporal judgments. It could be that the dual task of considering duration and
preference altered the usual pattern of duration estimates (while leaving some effects of
clicks intact).
Another novel result in Experiment 2 was that symmetrical patterns were judged to have
lasted longer than random ones, as well as being liked more. These two effects may be linked,
as the time perception literature has reported many variations of subjective time with
emotional stimuli (Angrilli, Cherubini, Pavese, & Manfredini, 1997; Droit-Volet & Gil,
2009; Ogden, 2013; Ogden et al., 2015). It is possible that the positive valence of symmetry
increases subjective duration of symmetry or that the negative valence of random decreases
the subjective duration of random, further investigation is warranted.
Confirming the null hypothesis? Perhaps the predicted effect of clicks on preference would have
been significant if the experiment had greater power? It is notoriously problematic to base
conclusions on nonsignificant effects. To overcome these traditional limitations, we
reexamined the effect of clicks using a new Bayesian alternatives to null hypothesis
testing (Masson, 2011). These procedures give two probability values, one for the null
hypothesis and one for the alternative hypothesis (rather than simply a single probability
for the observed data given the null hypothesis). In Experiment 1, the null hypothesis that
there would not be effect of sound on preference has a probability estimate of 96%.
Conventions are less well established than with convention statistics, but probabilities
more than 90% are considered strong, >99% ¼ very strong. For Experiment 2, the
same procedure gives the null hypothesis of probability of 86% and the alternative
hypothesis a probability of 14%. This approach to statistics supports our claim that
clicks have no effect on preference. For comparison, we can analyze the known effect
where clicks elevate subjective duration compared with silence. Given the observed data,
the null hypothesis is given a probability of only 4.2%, which the alternative hypothesis is
assigned 95.8%.
General discussion
There are various intriguing relationships between auditory click trains, temporal judgments,
subjective preference, and regularity. Some of these relations are implicit in existing literature,
while others have already been tested. This work fills some gaps in the current empirical
work.
First, evaluations of abstract stimuli are often shaped by the perceptual fluency. People
like patterns that are more fluently processed. Specifically, perceptual fluency has positive
hedonic tone, and this positive affect can be attributed to the stimuli under some conditions
12 i-Perception 0(0)
(Reber, 2012). Perceptual fluency has been operationalized as faster detection speed, and
abstract patterns that are detected quicker are usually those that are preferred (Makin
et al., 2012).
Prior presentation of auditory click trains may increase perceptual fluency. Clicks (5 Hz
for 3­5 s) have been shown to increase the amount of information processing that can occur
within a given duration and increase subjective duration. We hypothesized that such click
trains should increase liking of abstract patterns. However, this was not found in
Experiments 1 or 2. This is despite the fact that the clicks did increase the subjective
duration of the same stimuli in Experiment 2. Therefore, although the hypothesis that
clicks should increase preferences had prior plausibility, it was not confirmed. Perhaps the
magnitude of the increase in perceptual fluency caused by click trains was not strong enough
to alter preference, or perhaps, for some reason, perceptual fluency was not attributed to the
merits of the stimuli in this case. We also reasoned that clicks might produce arousal, which
could also have knock on effects on preference judgments (Treisman et al., 1990, Berlyne,
1971). Clearly this did not occur either.
We cannot exclude the possibility that some other type of repetitive stimuli could have
altered preferences, even though our auditory click trains did not. Our clicks were 5 Hz and
lasted 4 s, while participants did not explicitly have to process the clicks. These parameters
were very similar to those used in numerous interval-timing tasks, where positive effects of
clicks on subjective duration have been reported (e.g., Droit-Volet, 2010; Jones et al., 2011;
Treisman et al., 1990, Penton-Voak et al., 1996). However, it is possible that clicks of
different frequency, duration, or task relevance could alter preference. Third, it is known
that cross-modal attentional division can influence elements of visual processing (e.g.,
binocular rivalry, Alais, van Boxtel, Parker, & van Ee, 2010). Therefore, we cannot
exclude that the use of a repetitive visual (rather than auditory) prestimulus would have
altered preferences in our experiment. Some of these possibilities will have to be tested in
future work.
The most influential work on interval timing literature has concluded that white noise has
no effect on subjective duration, and that the effects of clicks on subjective duration are
multiplicative, growing with stimulus duration (e.g., Penton-Voak et al., 1996). Duration
estimates in our Experiment 2 were not consistent with either claim. We found no slope
effect and no significant difference between clicks and white noise. Do these apparent
anomalies mean that the data set cannot be the basis for solid conclusions? We think not.
First, the slope effect for clicks on duration has not always been replicated (Jones & Ogden,
2015). Second, the absence of a click effect on preference was replicated in Experiments 1
and 2, so this cannot be dismissed as an anomaly. Third, the ambiguities about white noise
and subjective duration do alter any of our conclusions about clicks and preference. At worst,
white noise might alter subjective duration, and there might be nothing special about clicks.
That would indeed challenge some earlier conclusions about the unique effect of repetitive
prestimulation on perceptual judgments. However, it would not challenge our conclusion
that repetitive prestimulation has no effect on preference for abstract patterns.
Despite the null effect of clicks on preference, this work produced other novel results. Both
experiments found that stimuli that were presented longer were preferred. This was true for
symmetrical patterns in Experiment 1 and for both symmetrical and random patterns in
Experiment 2. The effect of duration on preference was not an amplification effect, where
existing valence is exaggerated (Albrecht & Carbon, 2014). Instead, it seems that longer
presentations are preferred uniformly. We hypothesize that having longer to process the
stimuli is in itself rewarding, independently of stimulus valence.

Symmetrical patterns were judged to have lasted longer than random patterns. We can ask
which module of this internal clock is responsible for this? As stated above, anything that
alters pacemaker speed should produce different duration versus estimated duration slopes
(Penton-Voak et al., 1996). However, this was not found, the slopes were similar in the
symmetry and random conditions. This suggests symmetry and random presentations do
not result in differential pacemaker speeds. Instead, it could be that the switch connected
the pacemaker to the accumulator opened later in the random condition because attention
was briefly focused away from time in this condition. Either would reduce the number of
accumulated ticks in the random condition, resulting in the observed effect. Dual tasks have
been shown to alter temporal judgments (Zakay, 1998): When attention is shifted to other
tasks, subjective duration reduces, while when people attend to duration alone subjective
duration increases (Macar, Grondin, & Casini, 1994). It could be that presentation of the
random patterns shifted attention away from the timing task, so subjective duration was
reduced, or equally, we could say, presentation of symmetrical patterns, which were
processed with relative ease, allowed attention to remain on the timing task, so subjective
duration was increased.
In summary, we have investigated several hypotheses implicit in the current literature on
timing and symmetry perception. Despite prior plausibility, the presentation of auditory click
trains does not increase preference for subsequently presented abstract patterns, even though
the clicks do increase the perceived duration of the same patterns. We have, however, shown
that preferred (symmetrical) patterns appear to have been presented for slightly longer than
less preferred (random) patterns, and then longer presentation duration slightly increases
preference. Subjective time and preference are intimately connected in the human brain,
but not all plausible links are empirically demonstrable.
