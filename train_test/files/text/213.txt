Using the National Health Interview Surveys conducted from 1982 through 1993, this
article examines cohort patterns in disability and disease presence for adults born be-
tween 1915 and 1959, at ages ranging from 30 to 69 years. In general, disability decreases
for cohorts born between 1916 and the early 1940s (for men) or the early 1950s (for
women), but begins to increase for cohorts born after those dates. Later-born cohorts have
significantly lower levels of some diseases, most importantly cardiovascular diseases,
arthritis, and emphysema. However, some diseases and conditions are more prevalent in
later-born cohorts: asthma, musculoskeletal disorders, and orthopedic impairments. The
results presented here indicate that adults born in the late 1940s and 1950s will be in
better cardiovascular health but may be in worse musculoskeletal condition when they
enter old age compared with current cohorts of older persons.

Cohort Differences in Disability
and Disease Presence

Most studies of health trends emphasize a period
approach toward examining trends in age-specific pre-
valence of health states overtime (Crimmins & Ingegneri,
1993; Manton, Corder, & Stallard, 1993,1997; Verbrugge,
1989). A cohort approach provides a different picture
of health change in a society, one in which the relative
health of successive cohorts, rather than of successive
years, is the focus. Period trends in health are poten-
tially confounded by historical events and conditions
that birth cohorts experience at different points in their
respective life courses (Manton & Myers, 1987; Manton,
Stailard, & Corder, 1997). Such events include the Great
Depression and World Wars I and II, as well as the tim-
ing of specific medical advances and technological
innovations, changes in health affecting behaviors such
as diet and smoking, and environmental conditions.
Those for whom childhood was a period of depri-
vation because of depression or war may experience
lasting effects from these events (Barker, 1994). Alter-
natively, cohort differences in early-life exposure to
disease and pathogens may act to produce differences
in later-life health. For instance, cohorts born in this
century could experience differential disease later in
life because of differential exposure to the influenza
epidemic in 1918-1919, to rheumatic heart disease,
or to other viral or bacterially caused conditions. Co-
horts whose members understand the health risks as-
sociated with smoking and the consumption of fat at
a relatively young age may take actions that prevent
the onset of certain chronic diseases until later age.
The changing social circumstances of successive gen-

erations should have widespread effects on health
through differences in education, income, and occu-
pation. Better-educated cohorts should have better
health than less-educated cohorts through their greater
exposure to knowledge about health, better diets,
greater use of medical care, and less physically de-
manding occupations (Preston, 1992).
This article examines change in health across per-
sons born between 1915 ana 1959 using data from
the National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) for the
years 1982 through 1993. The analysis presented here
looks at cohort differences in disability and disease
presence across the adult ages. The article also exam-
ines whether cohort change is the same for men and
women and for those of lower compared with higher
socioeconomic status.
Background
Studies attempting to document changes in cohort
mortality and health have not all found clear pat-
terns of improving health in later cohorts. Wilmoth,
Vallin, and Caselli (1990), who studied the mortality
of French men and women born between 1894 and
1959, found cohorts that experienced "peculiarly"
high mortality. These high-risk cohorts included those
who were young adults during the two World Wars,
those who were very young during the influenza
epidemic of 1918-1919, and the youngest group
they studied--those who were born in the 1950s. The
adverse mortality of the last cohort was attributed
to changes in obstetrical practices that the authors
suggest allowed the survival of the "nonfit." Patrick,
Palesch, Feinleib, and Brody (1982) found lower death
rates from heart disease among more recent cohorts,
but the pattern of decline suggested a period rather
than cohort explanation of causation. Manton and Myers
578 The Gerontologist
(1987) found cohort differences in death rates from
cancer, heart disease, and stroke and attributed the
different cohort patterns of change across diseases to
a complex interaction of early-life exposure to disease
processes and response to medical advances. More
recently, Manton, Stallard, and Corder (1997) found
significant mortality reduction in old age across those
cohorts born in the 1887-1917 period. They attribute
this improvement to improved medical care, reduc-
tion in exposure to pathogens through a variety of
mechanisms, and improved nutritional conditions.
Studies of cohort changes in disease presence have
found some support for diminished disease prevalence
in more recent cohorts. Svanborg (1988) found lower
levels of peptic ulcer and gall bladder surgery in more
recent cohorts, which he attributes to improvements
in lifestyle. In a study of disease change over a cen-
tury, Fogel (1994) found that the level of heart dis-
ease was almost three times higher in older Civil
War veterans than in older World War II veterans; he
attributes decreasing disease prevalence to improve-
ments in nutrition. Cancer incidence has been shown
to vary widely by cohort, and later-born cohorts, in
general, have higher levels of many cancers (Davis,
Dinse, & Hoel, 1994).
Manton, Corder, and Stallard (1993, 1995; Manton,
Stallard, & Corder, 1997) found that during the 1980s
the prevalence of disability decreased in the older
population in the United States. Simultaneously, the
prevalence of some specific diseases decreased among
older persons, most notably arthritis and circulatory
and cerebrovascular conditions. At the same time, the
prevalence of other conditions increased, including
pneumonia, bronchitis, broken hips, and diabetes.
Manitoba, Roos, Havens, and Black (1993), who com-
pared health status in older adults born in 1971 and
1983, found more disability and disease among the
more recent cohort. In Britain, Jagger, Clarke, and
Clarke (1991), comparing two cohorts of older per-
sons, found disability levels improved but cognitive
functioning deteriorated for the more recent cohort.
Researchers who have investigated trends in health
at younger ages have reported findings that are less
positive. For instance, Cruenberg (1977) has empha-
sized the "failure of success" in talking about the
potential effect of the trend in increased survival of
nigh risk infants and others in weakened health states
on population health. Empirical evidence that is con-
sistent with this hypothesis is provided by Newacheck,
Budetti, and Halfon (1986), who found an increase
after 1970 in mild disability among children.
Trends in health change across multiple cohorts and
ages and considering a variety of diseases and disabil-
ity prevalence are, thus, somewhat mixed. The aim of
this article is to provide more evidence on the levels
of disability and the prevalence of major diseases
among a set of cohorts that span a wide range of birth
years and adult ages in the United States.
Data and Methods
Data from the annual National Health Interview Sur-
veys (NHIS) from 1982 to 1993 are the basis for this
analysis. The NHIS is an ongoing household survey of
the noninstitutionalized population of all ages in the
United States. The purpose of the NHIS, which began
in 1957, is to monitor population health and health
care usage; however, the analysis of time trends with
existing data is hampered by periodic revision in the
interview protocols. A major revision of the survey took
place between 1981 and 1982; thus, our analysis be-
gins with 1982 data and ends with 1993 data.
Using these data, we examine health and function-
ing indicators for adults 30-69 years of age. We end
the analysis before age 70 because the basic disability
questions in the NHIS differ for those aged 70 and
older (69 in 1982). To analyze cohort differences, we
constructed 15 3-year birth cohorts centered around
the years of 1916 to 1958 (i.e., the 1916 centered
cohort consists of those born in 1915, 1916, and 19.17).
These cohorts' data are then examined for each of
the 12 years from 1982 through 1993. Table 1 indi-
cates the central age of each cohort in each year. For
graphing purposes, we grouped the survey data into 3
years of data centered about the years 1983, 1986,
1989, and 1992 (i.e., the 1983 time period includes
data from the 1982, 1983, and 1984 NHIS). Three-
year cohorts and 3-year periods are used to produce
more stable rates, which better display cohort patterns
than those based on a single year or a single age. This
configuration of data produces up to four points of
observation for some cohorts, and as few as one for
other cohorts but the span of ages and years allows
for comparisons of successive cohorts at ages that span
the adult age range. In the statistical analysis, the data
are not grouped in the same way; 3-year cohorts are
identified as well as the age at interview for each in-
dividual. The number of respondents in the entire data
set was 599,141 for the 12-year period. The number
of respondents in each cohort ranges from 9,168 for
the 1916 cohort to 60,477 for the 1952 cohort.
Measures of Health
In the NHIS, long-term disability due to chronic dis-
ease or impairment is indicated by limitation in major
activity or in ability to work because of a health prob-
lem. Respondents are asked what they were "doing
most of trie past 12 months" and to indicate whether
their major activity consisted of "working at a job or
business, keeping nouse, going to school, or something
else." If respondents indicate that they were keep-
ing house most of the year, they are asked if "any
impairment or health problem now keeps them from
doing any housework at all" or "limits the kind or
amount of housework they can do." If they answer
any of the other three major activities, they are asked
whether "any impairment or health problem now
keeps them from working at a job or business" or "limits
the kind or amount of work" they can do. Housekeep-
ers are also asked about any adverse effects of their
health on their ability to work. Respondents report
whether they are unable to perform their major activity
or are limited in the kind or amount of major activity.
Even in these 12 years, women in these cohorts
have experienced changes in the likelihood of report-

"Example: 1916 cohort in 1982 consists of respondents born in 1915, 1916, and 1917, and thus aged 65, 66, and 67 in 1982. In all
figures, observation points are mapped, centered around years 1983, 1986, 1989, and 1992. In the case of the 1916 cohort, the data
contains ages 65-67 in 1982, 66-68 in 1983, and 67-69 in 1984. The datapoint in the figures is described by the midpoint of the age
range, e.g., 67 for the 1916 cohort in 1983.
ing housekeeping and working as their usual activities
(Figure 1). Later-born cohorts nave more workers and
fewer housekeepers at a given age than earlier-born
cohorts do. In Figure 1, earlier-born cohorts are to
the right; later-born cohorts are to the left. At the top
of the figure, moving leftward each successively born
cohort has an increasing proportion of its members
working at a given age until the 1946 cohort. At the
bottom of the figure, the pattern is reversed; moving
leftward there is a decreasing proportion of respon-
dents reporting housekeeping as a major activity at a
given age among younger cohorts. Because there is so
much change in major activity among women, we used
reported ability to work as our indicator of disability
for both working and nonworking women. This makes
the reference for disability assessment similar across
cohorts of women. In addition, it makes the measure
of disability similar for men and women, as men pre-
dominantly report "working at a job" as their major
activity, and both working and retired persons respond
to questions on their ability to work.
In order to monitor disease prevalence, each re-
spondent in the NHIS is asked about the presence of
a set of diseases or conditions selected from one of
six lists of medical conditions divided according to
body systems. Each list is presented to one sixth of
the sample to reduce respondent burden. The result
of this is that researchers cannot determine the preva-
lence of all diseases for all individuals. Depending on
the condition, respondents report whether they have
"ever had," "currently have," or "had in the past twelve
months" selected conditions. This information is used
to produce cohort prevalence of major diseases. In
this analysis, we examined cohort patterns in the pre-
valence of arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, cardiovascular
diseases, diabetes, emphysema, mental disorders, mus-
culoskeletal conditions, and orthopedic impairments.
These diseases and conditions include the major causes
of both death and disability for which information is
available to determine trends in prevalence.
In addition, we examined age and cohort patterns
in the presence of infectious diseases that result in
limitation of major activity for men and women. The
NHIS does not ask questions about the prevalence of
chronic infectious diseases in the six lists described
above, but because of the rise of AIDS in the past
two decades, examination of the trend in infections
as a cause of disability seems appropriate. Questions
about specific conditions limiting activity, including in-
fectious diseases, are asked of all respondents, so we
include these responses accordingly.
Methods of Analysis
Some of the analysis is presented graphically be-
cause strong cohort patterns are readily apparent in
the graphs. The statistical significance of cohort differ-
ences in health indicators is determined using logistic
regressions relating the likelihood of having a disabil-
ity (p) or a disease to age and cohort:
In (p/1 - p) = a + p/ge + p2
Age2 + Z. Cohort.,
/ = (-7 to 7),
where p1
and p are the coefficients representing the
linear and quadratic effects of age, respectively, and
Z. is a vector of coefficients representing the effect of
being in a specific cohort (/). The coefficients reflect
differences from the 1937 cohort, which is the middle
birth cohort (/ = 0); seven cohorts were born earlier
than this cohort, and seven cohorts were born later.
This study uses this method to note significant co-
hort differences but we are aware that, as in most
studies of this type, the differences could be inter-
preted as either cohort or period differences. Although
analysts have attempted to separate age, period, and

cohort effects, the required assumptions tend to influ-
ence the results heavily (Mason & Fienberg, 1985).
This study does not attempt to separate cohort effects
from period effects but rather to determine whether
there are significant differences among cohorts. We
regard this analysis as descriptive of cohort differences
rather than indicative of cohort causation.
Results
Cohort differences in disability, as indicated by limita-
tions in ability to perform major activity or work, are
shown for men in Figure 2 and for women in Figure
3. The odds ratios from the logistic regression analysis
are shown in Table 2. Examination of Figure 2 indi-
cates that the men of the earliest-born cohorts, ob-
served at ages older than 55, appear to be on age
trajectories with a higher level of disability than the
middle-aged and middle birth-year cohorts. Indeed,
the statistical analysis indicates that the percent of
men limited in major activity at a given age is gener-
ally higher in early-born cohorts. The cohorts of 1919
and 1916 are about 34% more likely to be limited
than those born in 1937; for the cohorts of 1922
and 1925, the excessive limitation is about 20% higher
than for the 1937 cohort. The cohorts born in the
1930s appear to be similar to each other, but the
1940 cohort has lower disability than the 1937 co-
hort. Later-born cohorts (i.e., those born after 1946)
appear to be more--not less--limited, by approximately
8%. This change in cohort trajectory among the young
is also visible in Figure 2. The cohort pattern for being
unable to perform major activity is similar to that for
limitation described above: there are higher levels of
limitation in cohorts born from 1916 through 1925,
improvements in disability for cohorts born from 1928
through 1943, and then some increase in disability
for subsequent cohorts.
For women, the cohort pattern in limitation in abil-
ity to work differs somewhat (Figure 3). There is less
limitation in earlier-born cohorts at the older ages,
and the lowest disability levels are for the 1946 and
1949 cohorts. The later-born cohorts at the younger
ages have higher disability levels, but they are not
significantly different from those of the 1937 cohort.
For women, the cohort pattern of inability to work
is generally one of improving cohort ability to work
among later-born cohorts. Women born from 1916 to
1922 were 11-27% more likely than those born in
1937 to report inability to work, out women born from
1940 through 1952 are more able to work than those
in the 1937 cohort. The last cohort, those born in
1958, is significantly more likely to report work in-
ability compared with those born in 1937.
The Prevalence of Selected Diseases
Cohort differences in the prevalence of selected
diseases are indicated in Table 3 (men) and Table 4
(women) by the coefficients and odds ratios. Men in

earlier-born cohorts have higher levels of arthritis, cardio-
vascular diseases, and emphysema. The relative risk
of arthritis is 16-40% higher in the 1931-1916 co-
horts than in the 1937 cohort. For those born in the
1955 cohort, the relative risk of arthritis is 23% below
that of the 1937 cohort. Cohort differences in cardio-
vascular diseases are fairly similar to arthritis in mag-
nitude: 13-36% higher in the 1928-1919 cohorts, and
17-31% lower in trie cohorts born in the 1950s. Em-
physema is the disease in which cohort differences
are the greatest. The 1916 cohort has a level of em-
physema two times that of the 1937 cohort, whereas
the 1958 cohort's level is 86% less than that of the
1937 cohort. On the other hand, earlier-born cohorts
have lower levels of diabetes and orthopedic im-
pairments. Men from later-born cohorts have higher
levels of asthma, although these differences are not
significant, and some cohorts born in the 1950s have
more musculoskeletal conditions. There are no clear
cohort patterns in mental disorders.
Women bom before 1937 do not have significantly
higher levels of any of these diseases or conditions
than the 1937 cohort, with the exception of arthritis.
Women born in the 1916-1925 cohorts have levels
of arthritis that are 13-30% higher than that of the
1937 cohort. Some women born before 1937 do, how-
ever, have lower levels of asthma, musculoskeletal con-
ditions, and orthopedic impairments, compared with
the cohort born in 1937. In cohorts born in 1946 or
after, there is less arthritis and cardiovascular disease
than in the 1937 cohort. Women from these later-
born cohorts, however, have higher levels of asthma
and orthopedic impairments.
Because of the tendency toward higher disability
among the youngest cohorts and the substantial rise
of AIDS over recent years, this study also examined
trends in the probability that an infectious disease
was the cause of a reported limitation in major activ-
ity. There is no cohort pattern of change in infectious
diseases for men. Among women, there is no cohort
pattern of differences, although the cohort born in 1922
has less limitation due to infectious diseases than the
1937 cohort.
Cohort Differences by Education
Increasing differentials in mortality over time have
been observed within the U.S. adult population (Feld-
man, Makuc, Kleinman, & Cornoni-Huntley, 1989; Pres-
ton & Elo, 1995). Cohort differences in disability and
disease prevalence by education level were examined
to see whether the pattern of change differs for socio-
economic groups within the population. The most
comparable indicator of cohort socioeconomic status
is education, but the average education level is chang-
ing markedly across these cohorts. For instance, the
proportion of respondents with fewer than 12 years
of schooling ranges from 46% for the 1916 cohort to
13% for the 1952 cohort. The two latest cohorts (1955,
1958) actually have slightly higher proportions who did
not finish high school (14%). Because the meaning
of an absolute amount of education changes across

these cohorts, we separated each cohort into low
and high education groups by designating those who
have less education than the bottom quartile as the
low education group. The line cannot be drawn at
the quartile break because in some cohorts education
level is so concentrated that the quartile and median
are the same. In this analysis, the low education group
for the 1916 cohort has 8 or fewer years of educa-
tion, whereas the low education group for the 1958
cohort has 11 or fewer years. The percentage of the
cohort in the low education group ranges from 27%
for the 1916 cohort to 12% for the 1952 cohort. Be-
cause of the variations in percentage, we tried sepa-
rating each cohort into low education and high edu-
cation groups using a variety of breakpoints between
the two categories and did not find the results sensi-
tive to these choices. Results from regressions indicat-
ing cohort differences in inability to perform major
activity or work for those of high and low education
are shown in Table 5.
Among men, the reduction in disability among the
cohorts born in the 1920s and earlier, from .22 to
.17, was experienced only by those with high educa-
tion levels. The highly educated men of the 1916 and
1919 cohorts have levels of disability 25% and 18%
higher, respectively, than the 1937 high education
group. More deterioration in health among later-born
cohorts of men is observed among those with low edu-
cation. For these men in the 1949 and later cohorts,
the level of disability is at least twice as high as in the
earlier-born cohorts. For high education men, the level
of disability for cohorts born from 1940 through 1949
is significantly lower than the 1937 cohort.
Among women with high education levels there
has been a trend toward less disability in later-born
cohorts. Although the 1916 and 1919 cohorts are sig-
nificantly more disabled than the 1937 cohort, other
cohorts are generally less disabled. There appears to
be a slight turnaround in the trend toward improve-
ment beginning with the first baby boom cohort (1946).
The 1955 and 1958 cohorts do not have disability
levels significantly different from the 1937 cohort. Among
women with low education levels, the improvement
between early-born cohorts and the 1937 cohort was
even greater than that among women with higher ed-
ucation. For these women with low education, there
is significant deterioration of health among cohorts born
in the 1950s, with the three latest-born cohorts' rela-
tive risk of disability increasing by 24-33%.
Cohort differences in the prevalence of selected dis-
eases for the high and low education groups are shown
in Table 6 (Men) and Table 7 (Women). Many of the
cohort changes in disease prevalence by education are
similar to those described earlier for the whole popu-
lation or are not very informative and are omitted from
the tables in the interest of brevity. These diseases in-
clude asthma, bronchitis, diabetes, mental disorders,
musculoskeletal conditions, and infectious diseases for
men, and bronchitis, diabetes, emphysema, mental dis-
orders, and infectious diseases for women.

588 The Gerontologist
Among men with higher levels of education, arthri-
tis is more prevalent in the cohorts born through 1931.
Compared with the 1937 cohort, cohorts born after
1940 have lower emphysema. There is a cohort pat-
tern of decrease in cardiovascular conditions among
men with high education levels, but most differences
are not significant.
Men with low education levels have strong cohort
patterns of decline in arthritis and emphysema. Again,
there is a suggestion of a pattern of decline in cardio-
vascular conditions. Later-born men with less educa-
tion have a strong pattern of cohort increase in ortho-
pedic impairments.
Women with more education in earlier-born co-
horts have lower levels of asthma, cardiovascular con-
ditions, and musculoskeletal impairments, relative to
the 1937 cohort. The later-born cohorts do not differ
from the 1937 cohort in cardiovascular diseases, mus-
culoskeletal disorders, or orthopedic impairments. Ar-
thritis is the only condition showing a pattern of
cohort improvement, with significant decreases in the
relative risk for later-born cohorts that range from 24%
to 43%. Asthma levels increase among later-born, more
highly educated women. This better-educated sub-
group is the only one that shows lower levels of car-
diovascular disease among cohorts born prior to 1937.
Women who have less education show a strong co-
hort pattern of improvement in arthritis, with a de-
creasing relative risk from 1.5 times (1919 cohort) to
60% (1958 cohort) compared with the 1937 cohort.
Cardiovascular diseases are higher among cohorts
born before 1937. Women with less education in the
latest-born cohorts have higher levels of orthopedic
impairments, musculoskeletal conditions, and asthma
than the 1937 cohort.
Summary and Conclusions
In order to extend the knowledge of cohort changes
in health, this study has examined age-specific levels
of disability and disease prevalence for cohorts born
from 1915 to 1959. As in previous research, this study
finds that patterns of change in cohort health are
mixed: the patterns of disability and disease change
among a large number of cohorts are complex and
cannot be summed up as "improving" or "deteriorat-
ing." Disability levels appear to have decreased among
conorts born in the early decades of this century. Our
analysis indicates, however, that later-born cohorts do
not continue to experience improvements in disability
and that there is some increasing disability for cohorts
born in the 1950s. Interestingly, the conorts among
whom we find increased disability are the same co-
horts that have relatively high mortality in France (Wil-
moth, Vallin, & Caselli, 1990).
Patterns of change differ somewhat by status as the
recent deterioration is concentrated among those
with low socioeconomic status. There has been much
discussion lately of the widening differentials be-
tween the "haves" and the "have nots." Health status
is another area in which the fortunes of different
groups in society may be moving in different di-
rections. This relative deterioration in health among
those who are least able to cope with disability is a
worrisome trend.
Cohort patterns of change in disease prevalence are
also mixed. Some diseases have declined, but others
have increased in prevalence. Where Fogel (1994) found
steadily decreasing rates of cardiovascular disease since
the Civil War and Manton, Stallard, and Corder (1995)
found reductions in cardiovascular diseases for the co-
horts born from the late 1880s through the 1930s,
this study found a pattern of steady cohort improve-
ment among men born from the 1900s to the 1950s,
but not for women. Among women, only cohorts born
since World War II have lower levels of cardiovascu-
lar disease overall, but the cohort pattern of change
in cardiovascular diseases among women diverges dra-
matically by social class. Women with lower educa-
tion levels have a pattern of improvement in early co-
horts while women with more education had lower
relative rates for cardiovascular disease before 1937
than after. The lack of improvement among better-
educated women presents an anomalous pattern that
deserves further investigation.
Arthritis, the major disabler of women, is a disease
with large decreases in prevalence among later-born
cohorts. This is certainly an encouraging trend because
it should imply decreased disability as later-born and
generally better-educated cohorts age.
There are other trends that are not as positive. For
example, respondents in more recent cohorts, espe-
cially women, are more likely to suffer from asthma.
This finding is not surprising given the recent findings
of increases in the prevalence of asthma among chil-
dren and young adults in the United States (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, 1995) and in other
countries (Anderson, Butland, & Strachan, 1994). Our
findings indicate, however, that this increase in asthma
may have started earlier than previously thought.
An increase in orthopedic and musculoskeletal im-
pairments, particularly among people of low education
levels, is another discouraging trend among later-born
cohorts. Potentially, the reduction in both milk con-
sumption and physical activity among more recent
co-horts could lead them to have lower bone density,
less muscle mass, and more musculoskeletal problems.
Further investigation of this trend is warranted.
Thus, the potentially good news of improving physi-
cal disability among cohorts who are now older is
offset somewhat by increasing levels of disability and
chronic conditions among younger cohorts. These co-
horts appear to be in better cardiovascular shape but
have the potential to be more disabled from muscu-
loskeletal conditions, particularly those cohort mem-
bers with low levels of education. These results imply
that the improvements in older adults' health found
by previous studies may show a positive trend that
may be difficult to sustain in the future.
These conclusions are suggestive rather than proof of
the cohort patterns described above. As noted in the
introduction, it is impossible to separate age, period,
and cohort effects without making some assumptions.
We, too, have made assumptions. Our specification of
age and cohort effects uses one of many possible op-
erational models. In order to test the sensitivity of our
Vol. 38, No. 5, 1998 589
results to this specification, we have performed the
analyses using other approaches: a linear age term only,
a linear cohort term and the quadratic age specifica-
tion used in the article, and a linear cohort term with
a categorical age variable. Although the results pre-
sented here are generally robust to the specification of
age and cohort, some conclusions about patterns of
cohort differences in specific diseases are sensitive to
specification.
Finally, we have discussed age and cohort effects
and have neglected period changes. Disability policy
change is one period factor that can affect time trends
in health status. Policies toward disability have gone
through cycles over recent decades: an apparent loosen-
ing of regulations in the 1970s, a subsequent tighten-
ing of the rules during the early 1980s (Bawden &
Palmer, 1984), with a reduction in the stringency of
regulations as a reaction in the later 1980s (Schulz,
1995). Although these policy changes may have
affected cohort levels of disability differentially, we
do not observe consistent cohort patterns that could
be attributed to such policy changes.
