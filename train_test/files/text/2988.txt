Published epidemiologic data regarding dermatologic prac­ tice may no longer be current. The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey conducted in 1990 provides a compre­ hensive assessment of ambulatory medical practice including patient demographics, chief and secondary complaints, diag­ noses, and drug treatments prescribed. Many specialties in­ cluding dermatology were represented in the sampling tech­ nique. The database was reviewed for descriptive aspects of visits to dermatologists surveyed. Using standardized weighting techniques, we estimated the total number of physician visits . Dermatologists had an estimated 24.0 mil­ lion patient encounters in 1990. Dermatologists treated a disproportionately large number of female and younger pa­ tients . After adjusting for their proportion of the population, Asians and Whites had greater numbers of dermatologic en­ counters than Blacks and Native Americans. Patients had two

or more complaints 27.2% of the time, and received two or more diagnoses 28.9% of the time. The most common com­ plaints accounting for 49.7% of visits included "pimples," "rash," "discoloration," "skin lesion," "wart," and "skin growth." The most common diagnoses, accounting for 52.7% of all encounters, were acne, keratosis, wart, dermati­ tis or eczema, benign neoplasm, and malignant neoplasm. This paper pres_ents demog_raphic information, chief and sec­ ondary complamts, and chief and secondary diagnoses of pa­ tients visiting dermatologists in the United States in 1990. Whites and Asian or Pacific Islanders have increased utiliza­ tion of services compared with Blacks and Native Americans or Eskimos; this disparity correlates with median family in­ come.

he National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) periodically provides information on ser­ vices rendered in physicians' offices. Stem and col­ leagues have reported results from the NAMCS 1974 and 1980-1981 surveys (1 ,2). Weinstock recently
presented brief preliminary results from the 1990 NAMCS (3). Since the last in-depth report of this database, changes have oc­ curred in the financing, organization, and delivery of medical care services. We have seen the continued development of health main­ tenance organizations, prospective payment schemes (4), resource­ based relative value systems [5], new therapeutic agents, and in­ creased educational efforts (6] regarding skin diseases . Thus, review of current epidemiologic practice information provides fundamen­ tal insight into our dynamic profession. The purpose of this paper is to describe aspects of dermatologic practice in 1990.
METHODS
The 1990 NAMCS was conducted by the National Center for Health Statis­ tics (NCHS) as an ongo in g descriptive data-collection effort regarding of­ fice-based physician practice (7). The sampling was limited to physicians principally engaged in patient-care activities who were not federally em­ ployed. The multistage probability sampling design is stratified by primary sampling unit (county, or contiguous counties, or a standard metropolitan statistic al area}, then by physician practices within the sampling unit , and

finally by patient visit within the 52 (weekly) ran omized periods of 1990. Within sma ll practices, a 100% sample of one week' s visits was possible. For very large practices, a systematic random sample from among all visits for a selected week achieved a 20% sampling rate. The resulting national esti­ mates describe the utilization of ambulatory services in the United States. In 1990, 43,469 records provided by 1,684 participating doctors can be used co estimate the experience of 704,603,932 annua l office-based visits. For der­ matology as a specialty, 2,530 records randomly collected from 135 special­ ists statistically represent the experience of 24,009,272 individual visits to approximately 5,953 dermatologists. All estimates are subject to sampling error. The relative standard error for each estima te in this study is based upon the number of patient visits. The estimated relative standard error for derma­ tology varies from 13. 7% for the estimates of 10,000,000 visits to 32.3% for those of 100,000 visits [7].
  For chis study, the entire dermatologist subsample was extracted from the national database. After sampling weights were app lied to achieve the na­ tionally representative estimates, a geographically balanced estimate of the dermatology experience could be described by collected parameters includ­ ing patient demographics, reason for visit, diagnoses , services provided, and medications ordered. Census data were obtained from the US Bureau of the Census (8]. For all races, the 1990 median family income was $36,062. The proportional income listed in Table Vis the ratio of the income of the group compared with the populat ion as a whole. The analysis was performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

were identical. Physician encounters by women for each of the six most frequent diagnoses were greater than for visits by men. T he greatest disparity between genders was for the diagnosis acne, in which there were an estimated 3.9 million female visitors compared with 1.8 million male visitors. The tenth most frequent diagnosis in men, malignant neop lasm (173.9, 170,000 visits), was the eleventh most frequent in women {148,000 visits).
Racial Differences The racial distribution of the 1990 patient visits is described in Table V. Taking into account their proportion of the population, Whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders had similar numbers of visits to dermatologists. By contrast Blacks and Native Americans had far fewer per capita visits. The leading diagnoses by racial groups are listed in Table VI. Dyschromia was among the top five primary diagnoses for both Blacks and Asians/Pacific Islanders. For whites it was the fifteenth most common diagnosis.
Age Differences Dermatitis or eczema is a leading diagnosis for all age groups (T able VII). Within the pediatric (0 - 15) and young adult (16 - 35) groups, acne, warts, and dermatitis or eczema pre­

two or more reasons identified, and 4.0% had threeor more reasons. The five leading primary diagnoses, which account for 48.1% of all encounters were acne, keratosis, warts, dermatitis or eczema, benign neoplasm, and malignant skin neoplasm . These primary and other diagnoses are listed in Tables III and IV. In the surveyed population, 28.1% received two or more diagnoses, and 4.8% received three or more diagnoses.
Referral of Patients The majority of patients {90.4%) were not referred by other physicians for their office evaluation. In the 9.6% of referred patie nt_s, the five leading reasons accounting for 68.6% of referrals were "skin rash," " discoloration" or "pigment alter­ ation," "acne vulgaris," skin " lesion," and "warts." The five lead­ ing diagnoses accounting for 37.7% assigned to referred patients were keratoses, acne vulgaris, dermatitis or eczema, wart, and ma­ lignant neoplasm.
Gender Differences in Diagnoses The nine most common diagnoses for both men and women and their order of frequency

dominate. With advancing age, acne visits decline whereas kera­ toses and malignant tumors become more common diagnoses.
DISCUSSION
The 1990 NAMCS data provide a comprehensive  assessment  of U .S. outpatient dermat ologic services. In his survey of 421 derma­ tologists, Mendenhall found that 97% of all dermato logic services are performed outside the hospital setting [9]. According ly, the NAMCS data shou ld be representative of the bu lk of U.S. derma­ tology practice. The exclusion federally employed physicians from the NAMCS database decreases the number of patient encounters reported. However, based upon an estimate of230,000 annual Vet­ erans Affairs clinic visits [10], if the proportion of dermatology visits is comparable, the exclusion of this source misses only 0.03% of the total visits. Similarly, an unknown and likely small number of mili­ tary physician visits are excluded from this analysis. The excl usion of dermatologic researchers by NAMCS also has the potential to skew the data away from more complex referral diagnoses managed in the University setting such as autoimmune bullous disorders and connective tissue dermatoses.
  Using previously reported 1980-1981 NAMCS [2] results for comparison, these new data suggest that the total yearly number of outpatient encounters by dermato logists in 1990 has increased 14 %

from 21.0 to 24.0 million. In the same time period, the number of fellow and life members of the American Academy of Dermatology increased by approximately 27%.* In 1986, Stern estimated that the number of practicing dermatologists would increase from 1980 to 1990 by approximately 35% [11). These data suggest that the in­ creasing numbers of practicing dermatologists are competing for fewer num bers of availab le patients. This trend may be further exacerbated as managed care systems limit access to quality specialty care.
  
Utilization of dermatologic physician services are more common for female than male  patients.  Nevertheless,  according  to  the Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (HANES), skin pa­ thology is consistently more preva le nt among male than female patients [12]. Moreover, female  patients  only  constitute  51.2%  of the total population [7], yet 57.2% of the outpatient  dermatology visits were for female patients.

groups. Inde ed, because of the relatively small numbers of observa­	 	

tions, we can draw no conclusions regarding utilization of services by Native Americans or Eskimos.
  Patients seen by dermatologists often have more than one reason for their visit and they also often receive more than one diagnosis. Nearly three of ten patients had more than one reason for their visit and received multiple diagnoses. The comp le xity of dermatologic practice is increased by the need to obtain separate histories, perform more than one directed physical examination, and manage each additiona l diagnosis.
For many patients, dermatologists provide primary care for their
cutaneous hea lth. Primary care may be defined as "the point of entry into the health services system and the locus of responsibility for organizing care for patients and populations over time [13]. Derma­ tologis ts frequently provide mucocutaneous health care for patients and their families over years or decades and dermatologists promote disease prevention. Although he used different survey populations and methods, Mendenhall in 1978 found that seven of ten outpa­ tients were self-referred to dermatologists [9]. The 1980-1981 and 1990 NAMCS data respectively show that over 94% and 90% of outpatients were not referred to dermatologists by other physicians. Therefore up to 3.1% of all the US ambu lat ory primary care (the fraction of nonreferred dermatology patients of the total national visits) may be provided by dermatologists. The increased use of dermatologists as primary physicians for mucocutaneous health may reflect educationa l efforts by our specialty. The trend towards more dermatologic primary care is surprising given the increase in managed care systems.
  This study has resulted in a characterization of ambu lato ry der­ matologic care in the U.S. in 1990. Utilization of dermatologic services differed between genders, ages, and races. This study does not provide data for the calculation of cutaneo us disease incidence or
