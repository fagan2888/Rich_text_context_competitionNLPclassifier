Introduction
Political outcomes depend on the institutions that regulate
who gets to become political leaders and within which they
make decisions. Scholarship suggests that economic growth
is enhanced by `good' institutions (Acemoglu et al., 2001;
Knutsen, 2011), interstate peace better preserved when
political leaders are `constrained' in their foreign policy
(Choi, 2010), and armed conflict is more likely to erupt
when institutions are `inconsistently democratic' (Hegre
et al., 2001). All of these concepts, however, are hard to
define: what they mean is often contested, they are multidi-
mensional, it is unclear what their necessary conditions are,
and it is not obvious how to capture them empirically from
written sources. For example, to some democracy is a func-
tion of representation and power sharing (e.g. Lijphart,
1999), to others it is about institutions that facilitate compe-
tition (Schumpeter, 1950; Przeworski et al., 2000). In many
cases, assessing whether the institutions in a particular
country at a given time are `democratic' or if they embody
Lijphartian `power sharing'involves a considerable amount
of judgment. In this judgment, it is often impossible to dis-
tinguish between the institutions that regulate behaviour
and the behaviour itself. An example is the most widely
used indicator of democracy, from the Polity dataset
(Jaggers and Gurr, 1995; Marshall et al., 2013). The coding
of the degree of institutional constraints on the executive in
Polity, for instance, is largely a subjective assessment with-
out reference to specific provisions in a country's constitu-
tion or other laws.
This article presents an update and expansion of the IAEP
dataset (the Institutions and Elections Project, by Regan
et al., 2009), which seeks to address these definitional and
measurement issues by coding an extensive set of de jure
institutional provisions in countries' constitutions that
together form a picture of the formal setup of a country's
institutions. De jure aspects of institutions have the distinct
advantage that they can be coded quite unambiguously from
written sources. One may debate whether the executive of

Abstract
This article presents an updated version of the Institutions and Elections Project (IAEP) dataset. The dataset comprises
information on 107 de jure institutional provisions, and 16 variables related to electoral procedures and electoral events,
for 170 countries in the period 1960­2012. The dataset is one of the most encompassing datasets on global institutional
variation that explicitly codes de jure formal institutions. This article presents the dataset and compares it with existing
datasets on political institutions, highlighting how the IAEP's focus on disaggregated de jure institutions complements
existing datasets that combine de facto and de jure elements. We illustrate the potential uses of the data by constructing
indices that capture institutional dimensions beyond the standard democracy­autocracy dimension, and that represent
different ways of using the data for index construction. Finally, we illustrate potential applications by conducting a short
replication and expansion of a recent study of democracy and civil war onset.

Russia is less `constrained'than that of Ukraine (Polity codes
them as 4 and 5, respectively), but not to the same extent
whether the constitution confers the constitutional court
authority to rule on executive action. This allows for more
fine-grained analyses of how and when formal rules affect
institutional behaviour and, in turn, outcomes such as con-
flict or economic development. Disadvantages with relying
on de jure institutions, obviously, is that they may be system-
atically disregarded in practice, and that they reflect little
more than individual aspects of a bundle of institutions that
must be considered together. Still, they are an important
complement to most datasets on institutions, which rely
heavily on subjectively coded indices of de facto aspects.
Focusing on de jure institutions allows us to answer crucial
questions about when formal institutions constrain behav-
iour. The IAEP is currently one of the most comprehensive
datasets on political institutions and elections in existence,
and it should provide scholars with the opportunity to
develop more refined testable implications about how politi-
cal institutions affect outcomes.
In the next section of the article we present an overview
of the dataset, accompanied by a discussion of how the
IAEP compares to existing datasets on political institutions.
This is followed by some illustrations of how the data can
be used. First, we present trends in a selected number of
institutional indicators over time. Second, we present two
aggregate indices that we create out of the individual indi-
cators, each constructed using a distinct approach to index
construction. This is done to illustrate how the data can be
used to create indices in several ways. Finally, we illustrate
another potential use of the dataset by replicating and
expanding on a study on democracy and civil war by
Cederman et al. (2010).
The dataset
Overview
The updated IAEP dataset describes the relationships
between the ruled and their rulers across 170 countries
coded annually for the years 1960­2012.1
There are two groups of IAEP indicators. The first group
contains 107 variables that record information about the de
jure institutional arrangements of a country. The codebook
(available as an online appendix) groups the indicators into
aspects of a country's constitution, its legislature, execu-
tive­legislature relationship, the judiciary, government
centralization, the central bank, elections and electoral out-
comes, and rules governing elections.
In addition to this, there are 16 variables that record
information about the practice of elections, if any, in a
country. The `election in practice' component to these
data are recorded as events and characterize elections if
they are held, in democracies, partial democracies, or
non-democracies.
The information in the dataset is gathered from a num-
ber of publicly available sources and legal texts that are
described in the appendix. To assess the reliability of cod-
ings, we have conducted inter-coder reliability tests, all
suggesting that the reliability of the codings is high (see the
appendix).
Contrasts with other datasets
The IAEP compares favourably with several other datasets
on political institutions, and serves as an important comple-
ment to many of them. Most existing datasets mix de jure
and de facto elements together, and are highly aggregated,
in stark contrast to IAEP which is disaggregated and mostly
de jure. The largest category of institutional datasets is con-
cerned with measuring democracy. The perhaps most popu-
lar dataset is Polity (Marshall, 2010), which sets out to
measure aspects of democracy based on Dahl's (1971) con-
ceptualization. Although Polity has a number of attractive
features (it disaggregates into sub-components, and has a
long time series), it has some important flaws. Most nota-
bly, many of the sub-dimensions in Polity measure out-
comes rather than institutions, such as the participation
component which includes internal political violence as
part of its coding (Vreeland, 2008). A similar critique of
coding bias has often been levelled at the Freedom House
dataset, which bases most of its codings on subjective
assessments of political outcomes that are entangled with
many potential dependent variables (Cheibub et al., 2010).
Another dataset that is affected by this criticism is the
Vanhanen dataset (Vanhanen, 2000), which measures con-
testation and participation based on electoral outcomes. A
dataset that is considered to be more reliable and less sensi-
tive to endogeneity biases is the ACLP/DD dataset
(Przeworski et al., 2000; Cheibub et al., 2010). Although it
mostly relies on objective coding criteria, e.g. the presence
of elections with more than one party, it also captures polit-
ical contestation in the form of actual government turnover,
which is partly also an institutional outcome, and thus sub-
ject to similar criticisms (see e.g. Knutsen and Wig, 2015).
The most ambitious democracy dataset to date is the V-Dem
(Coppedge et al., 2011) project, which is currently develop-
ing a large collection of disaggregated democracy indica-
tors. It fundamentally differs from IAEP since V-dem's
focus is mostly on subjectively coded de facto and not de
jure institutional characteristics, making it an important
complement to IAEP when it becomes available. In short,
IAEP is distinguished from existing democracy datasets in
their focus on disaggregated de-jure institutions.
A handful of other datasets have some points of similar-
ity with IAEP but lack its main focus on formal rules. For
example, the POLCON database (Henisz, 2002), and the
Database of Political Institutions (Beck et al., 2001). The
only existing dataset that shares both IAEP's scope and
focusondejureinstitutions,istheComparativeConstitutions
Wig et al. 3
Project (CCP) (Elkins et al., 2010), which codes a wide
range of constitutional provisions for all countries in the
world going back to 1789. Given the similar focus on de jure
institutions, there is some overlap between the variables
contained in the CCP and IAEP. This can obviously be a
benefit, since a greater variety of sources for the same data
is an undisputable good when investigating the robustness
of empirical results to different sources. Furthermore, a
number of institutional domains are covered in the IAEP
that are not covered in the CCP, and vice versa. For exam-
ple, many of the formal rules that are not constitutional, but
still de jure, like many provisions concerning the central
bank, rules governing party participation in elections, candi-
date nomination and participation, and variables relating to
the outcomes and holding of elections themselves (which
are not de jure).
Focusing on formal institutions allows researchers to
separate the formal rules that may or may not constrain
behaviour from the behavioural outcomes that are produced
by institutions, which most current datasets mix together.
This enables `unbundling' of institutions into formal and
non-formal components in a much more refined way than
previous attempts to disaggregate institutions (e.g.
Acemoglu and Johnson, 2005). As many have pointed out
(e.g. Voigt, 2013), lumping the behavioural and formal ele-
ments of institutions together in one measure is questiona-
ble. Conceptually, because there is a clear distinction
between the normative content of a rule and its de facto
implementation. Empirically, because there are often clear
discrepancies between de jure and de facto rules, as for
example Hayo and Voigt has shown in the case of judicial
independence (Hayo and Voigt, 2007).
Another clear strength of focusing on formal rules is
that they are easier to code reliably. As mentioned, many
of the most common institutional indices are subjectively
coded and very often endogenous to outcomes of interest,
such as economic growth (Glaeser et al., 2004) or inter-
nal armed conflict (Vreeland, 2008). Coding de jure insti-
tutions avoids this problem, and allows researchers to
study the links between formal rules, institutional out-
comes (i.e. institutional behaviour), and variables of
interest.
To summarize, the IAEP is one of the few publicly avail-
able dataset that describes the nuts and bolts of countries'
de jure political institutions globally. It allows researchers
to investigate how de jure political institutions constrain
and shape behaviour and political outcomes. In the follow-
ing, we illustrate some of its potential uses.
Trends in individual institutional indicators
The primary source from which most of the information in
our dataset is derived is the constitution of a country or
other legal documents. IAEP comprises information on a
range of individual constitutional provisions that are essen-
tial in classifying regimes along dimensions such
as democracy­autocracy, degree of constitutionalism or
power sharing. Figure 1 shows trends in the global propor-
tion of countries that possess institutional provisions typi-
cal of democracies; formal operational constitutions,2 a
supreme court,3 judicial review,4 elections to the executive
and legislature,5 and a national legislature.6
The left box shows global trends in the presence of a
supreme court, a constitution, and judicial review; all ele-
ments of constitutional rule. The figure shows an increase
in the presence of courts and judicial review, while most
countries have had operational formal constitutions
throughout the period. The right box in Figure 1 shows that
the number of countries holding elections has increased
steadily over time, reaching a peak in the mid-2000s. The
same goes for the proportion of countries with a supreme
court. These developments align with the increase in the
number of democracies in the `third wave of democracy'
that followed the end of the cold war (Huntington, 1991).
The figure also shows that the number of countries with
legislatures, and formal and operational constitutions has
remained relatively stable throughout the period.
Figure 2 shows global trends in the proportion of coun-
tries having two constitutional provisions typical of autoc-
racies: bans on specific parties and the presence of an
official state party. This figure shows that these two auto-
cratic institutions have, logically enough, declined with the
spread of elections and judiciaries. After a spike in the early
1970s, and a hiatus until the late 1980s, there is a strong
downward trend after the end of the Cold War, coinciding
with the third wave of democracy. These two figures show
how the third wave of democratization can be tracked by
looking at individual de jure institutions.
Constructing institutional
dimensions
Individual indicators might often not yield significant
information about a political system when considered in
isolation, but may do so only when they are considered as
part of an institutional dimension. In the following, we will
illustrate some potential uses of the dataset by constructing
two different indices. In doing so, we will both illustrate
what kind of substantive indices are possible to construct
with the data, but also two different methodological
approaches to index construction that are often found in the
literature: factor analysis and construction using the logic
of necessary and sufficient conditions. This exercise is
intended to illustrate two plausible indices and encourage
users of the dataset to develop their own.
Executive constraints
The first index we construct is intended to capture execu-
tive constraints and will utilize a factor-analytic approach

to index construction. This index builds on the IAEP-based
executive constraints index presented in Regan et al.
(2009). It includes items that either constitute an executive
power ­ like an executive power to dissolve parliament ­,
or some sort of check on the executive ­ like a legislative
veto. The following items are included as executive pow-
ers: The power to remove the legislature, propose legisla-
tion, remove judges, amend constitution, ratify constitution,
use force abroad without legislative approval, change taxes
without legislative approval, and whether the executive is
chosen independently of legislature. The following are
included as executive liabilities or checks: The existence of
a legislature, a legislative veto, legislature can remove the
executive, legislature can propose legislation, legislature
can amend constitution, legislature can ratify amendments,
there are elections for the executive, legislative approval
for the budget is required, the court can rule on executive
action, executive is a member of the legislature. The first
set of items are conceived as powers given to the executive,
while the last set of items includes constraints on the execu-
tive. We proceed to fit a unidimensional Item Response
Model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, a factor-
analytic approach that has become standard in the develop-
ment of latent institutional indices (see e.g. Rosenthal and
Voeten, 2007; Ríos-Figueroa and Staton, 2014). Essentially,
this model estimates the ideal points (factor scores) for
each country-year on the dimension that best describes the
patterns of the individual institutional provisions men-
tioned above.7
Figure 3 shows the estimated ideal points for our execu-
tive constraints index for a random sample of 60 countries
in 2010. The latent index seems to do an acceptable job of
separating the cases with a very high score from the cases
in the bottom of the ranking. However, because of the large
confidence intervals, there is a fair amount of uncertainty in
the cases in the middle of the scale.
Does this index track the executive constraints concept?
The country given the highest score on the latent dimen-
sion, i.e. the most constrained, is Nicaragua in 1995, which
has a total of 9 of 10 of the executive liabilities mentioned
above, and 4 out of 9 of the executive powers listed above.
Crucially, it has a number of important executive liabilities
such as a legislative veto and the right of the legislature to
remove the executive. The lowest-scoring country,
Cambodia in 1994, has 5 out of 10 liabilities, and 5 out of 9
powers. Crucially, it has a number of important executive
powers; the executive can disband parliament and appoint
judges. These cases indicate that the dimension is repre-
senting the degree of executive constraints. Figure 4 shows
the discrimination parameters of each institutional provi-
sion, and the number of such provisions that the item
response model correctly predicts. Executive liabilities are

highlighted as triangles and powers are highlighted as
crosses. If the index is adequately separating constraints
from executive powers it should group the powers and lia-
bilities in opposite ends of the spectrum. The figure shows
that the latent dimension estimated by the Iterm Response
Theory (IRT) model is not perfect at grouping liabilities
and powers in two different clusters, although most liabili-
ties have positive discrimination parameters and most
powers have negative coefficients. What this exercise
shows is that our de jure institutional indicators can be used
to construct latent variable indices. The figures presented
above show that the executive constraints index constructed
here does an imperfect, although not hopeless, job of sepa-
rating countries on the theoretically relevant dimension.
Combining de jure measures with information about de
facto institutions would be one way to construct a more
accurate dimension.
Institutionalized participation
Second, we will construct an index of institutionalized par-
ticipation (IP) that illustrates how we can use theoretical
prior information about the logical structure of the concept
to calculate an index that more closely aligns with the theo-
retical concept than simple aggregation or inductive factor
analysis. (For more on conceptual logic, see e.g. Goertz,
2006.) We build this index with the intentions to measure
the degree to which electoral participation is institutionally
protected. A necessary condition for electoral participation
is the presence of elections, therefore we start with a logical
condition stating that the measure should be scored as zero
when there is no election to either the executive or the leg-
islature. If and only if there are elections to at least the
executive or the legislature, we consider whether there are
restrictions on (a) suffrage, and (b) political parties. If there
is universal suffrage and no party restrictions, we want this
measure to get a top score, while we want it to get the low-
est score if it has fully restricted elections where many
groups are excluded and parties banned. Such a measure
would capture the fact that elections are necessary but not
sufficient conditions for institutionalizing electoral partici-
pation; Only elections with universal suffrage and free
party competition are sufficient for saying that participation
is fully institutionalized. Therefore, we construct IP as
follows:
IP PB SR
E
i i i i
= - +
.( ( ))
2 (1)
where E represents elections, PB is the number of party
bans, normalized by dividing on the maximum value, SR is
the similarly normalized number of suffrage restrictions,
and i signifies the given country. For simplicity, we scale IP
to range between zero and one, where one signifies univer-
sal suffrage and no party restrictions, while a score of zero
means that you either have no elections, or elections with
the full amount of party and suffrage restrictions.
Intermediate scores such as 0.45 mean elections with some
restrictions; this is, for example, the case for Cuba in the
1980s which had elections with universal suffrage, but a
ban on all parties. This measure reflects the logical rela-
tions between the items that make up the index; elections
are necessary conditions for participation, but party bans
and suffrage restrictions are alternative and substitutable
ways to block participation.
Application
To further illustrate how the IAEP data may be used, we
present a brief replication and extension of a recent study
investigating the links between democracy and internal
armed conflict where we use the institutionalized participa-
tion index created above. Cederman et al. (2010) show that
democratization leads to internal armed conflict. As one of
several supporting arguments, they draw on the argument
of Huntington (1968) that democratization can lead to con-
flict because it entails sudden mass mobilization in institu-
tional contexts that have not accommodated such pressures

before. In short, democratization is destabilizing when it
leads to a sudden increase in political participation. One
implication of this argument is that we should observe less
conflict in democratization processes where mass partici-
pation is already institutionalized. Where the institutions
already have accommodated mass participation, and the
democratization process concerns some other institutional
feature such as an increase in constraints on the executive
or an expansion of non-electoral political liberties, the risk
of conflict should be lower. This can be formulated in the
following hypothesis.
Hypothesis 1. Institutional changes toward democracy
increases the risk of conflict where pre-existing levels of
IP is low, but less so where participation is well
established
This hypothesis is not tested in Cederman et al. (2010),
but is a logical implication of the mobilization argument.
We investigate H1 by interacting Cederman et al.'s democ-
ratization variable with the lagged level of IP as we have
coded it. We also interact democratization with lagged lev-
els of the more subjective POLCOMP variable from Polity
which captures the `democraticness' of participation and
competition (Marshall et al., 2013, 25­29, 67). Since the
IAEP institutions are measured on the 1 January, while the
Polity dataset used by Cederman et al. is coded on the 31
December (Marshall et al., 2013, 12), our participation var-
iable should be considered as lagged by 1 year. POLCOMP
is lagged by 1 year. Cederman et al. code democratization
by using the POLITY index as a basis; they code a move-
ment in Polity as a democratization if it constitutes a move
larger than two points on the POLITY index, and if it is
followed by a period of stability where the new level of
POLITY on average is more than two points higher than in
the previous stable period (see Cederman et al., 2010,
370­382).
In their core model, Cederman et al. include their varia-
ble capturing democratization (dem), autocratization (aut),
and controls for population, GDP per capita, and time trends
using calendar year, peace years and splines. The first col-
umn in Table 1 replicates their model 1.1. The second col-
umn runs the same model on the more restricted sample
that is covered by the IAEP. The third column tests our
proposition, and indeed finds support for it. The main
term is significant and positive, and the interaction term
significant, negative, and of equal size as the main
term. Democratization is particularly conflict-inducing in

contexts where the IP index is zero, while the effect of democ-
ratization on conflict drops with increases in IP at t - 1.
The upper box in Figure 5 shows the probability of con-
flict given democratization (dem = 1), as IP increases, all
other variables held at their means. This shows that the
association between democratization and conflict weakens
with the level of pre-existing IP, suggesting that the effects
of democratization might arise from sudden increases in
political mobilization, as suggested by Huntington (1968)
among others. During periods of no democratization, IP
has no effect on conflict risk, as indicated by the lower box
in Figure 5. When we compare this result to the result found
when using POLCOMP from Polity (the fourth column),
we do not find the same pattern. When the `democraticness'
of participation is measured by POLCOMP, the level of IP
already in place when the transition happens seems to not
matter at all, contrary to the postulated mobilization mech-
anism. There are several reasons to have more faith in the
IAEP index than in POLCOMP. The latter mixes both de
jure and de facto restrictions on participation. The coding
of its subcomponents includes behavioural aspects, includ-
ing categories such as `transitional' and `factional' compe-
tition, which can be endogenous to political instability
(Hegre et al., 2001; Vreeland, 2008). The IAEP IP index is
more transparent and less tainted by endogeneity: it simply
denotes whether there are institutionalized elections and
how restricted participation is.
Conclusion
This update of the IAEP dataset makes a number of contribu-
tions to the ongoing empirical study of the effects and causes

of political institutions. The dataset is one of the few large-
scale global time-series datasets to code explicitly de jure
institutions. The high resolution of the dataset will enable
scholars to study the effects of specific institutional provi-
sions, and to investigate how these interact with other provi-
sionsordimensions.Wehaveillustratedhowthedatasetallows
for disaggregated analyses; for example, the spread of spe-
cific autocratic or democratic constitutional provisions over
time, and for aggregation; by combining institutions to form
specific institutional dimensions that can be compared and
contrasted to existing institutional dimensions such as autoc-
racy-democracy. The dataset will serve as a powerful comple-
ment to existing datasets on de facto aspects of political
institutions, allowing scholars to study the interplay between
formal constitutions and institutional behaviour.

Notes
1. The original dataset covered the years 1972­2006.
2. Formal operational constitutions are coded as 1 if: The indi-
cators writconstit = = 1, formalconstit = = 1, and ineffect = = 1,
and 0 otherwise.
3. Supreme court: court = = 1.
4. courtleg = = 1 or courtexec = = 1.
5. Elections to the executive: elecexec = = 1. Elections to the
legislature: elecleg = =1.
6. National legislature: leg = = 1.
7. The model estimates a latent dimension that yields the high-
est likelihood of generating the patterns of ones and zeros in
the data. More specifically, we estimate the one-dimensional
model using the ideal function in the pcsl (Jackman, 2011).
In this model, we drop all countries with more than 10 miss-
ing items, use a burn-in setting of 10,000, and a thinning of
100. We do not impute missing data in the model.
