Introduction
Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation ther-
apy often experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of
appetite, leading to a lower dietary intake and weight loss.
It is estimated that more than 80% of patients suffering
from cancer use vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other sup-
plements, including probiotics during the course of their
disease.1 However, the use of dietary supplements during
anticancer treatment remains controversial. The number of
available commercial products for alternative and comple-
mentary medicine has been increasing. Limited evidence
confirming their safety and benefits from human clinical
studies has led to a recommendation for cancer patients to
take only moderate doses of dietary supplements.2
Most supplements are safe and provide nutritional sup-
port not obtained in the patient's current diet to ameliorate
specific pathophysiological conditions and to address the
patient's needs. On the other hand, supplemental intake
might change the metabolism of anticancer drugs and

Abstract
Purpose. Availability without prescription restriction, low cost, and simple oral administration allow cancer patients to use
probiotics without knowledge of potential risks. We present a survey of probiotic use and the association with patient
tumor characteristics in cancer patients treated at the outpatient department of the National Cancer Institute in Slovakia.
Patients and Methods. Between March and December 2014, 499 patients were asked to evaluate their overall experience
with probiotics by questionnaire form, including the length and method of use relative to anticancer therapy, expectations,
side-effect experiences, understanding of the possible risks, dietary supplement use, and others. The relevant data were
statistically evaluated. Results. The cohort consisted of 323 women (64.7%) and 176 men (35.3%); 91.6% were undergoing
chemotherapy (2.6% together with radiotherapy) and 8.4% had no anticancer therapy. The prevalence of probiotic use was
28.5% and only 12 patients using probiotics (8.5%) described negative side effects. Most patients declared consideration
of probiotic use based on recommendation from a physician (37.3%) or a pharmacist (14.8%). Nevertheless, up to 86.6%
of patients declared no knowledge of possible risks. Statistically significant correlation was found between probiotic use
and age of patients (P < .008), gender (P < .023), and taking other dietary supplements (P < .000002). Conclusions. In
this prospective study, we present for the first time the prevalence, side-effect experience, and aspects that most likely
influence probiotic use in cancer patients. Minimal knowledge of risks underlines the importance of an active approach by
oncologists to inform patients about probiotic safety.

consequently affect the outcome of therapy. Moreover,
besides the beneficial effects associated with probiotic
administration, there could be several adverse events,
including potentially life-threatening conditions such as
sepsis, because of immunosuppression in cancer patients
undergoing chemotherapy. As many as 50% or more of
patients with cancer take vitamins, herbal preparations, and
other supplements, including probiotics, without medical
guidance.3,4 Availability without prescription restriction,
low cost, and simple oral administration allow cancer
patients to use probiotics without knowledge of the poten-
tial risk. Because of this fact, the safety of probiotic use in
immunocompromised cancer patients has become a very
important issue these days.
Probiotics are live microorganisms, which as drugs or
food supplements help maintain a healthful beneficial micro-
bial balance in the digestive tract of a human or other host.5,6
The human gastrointestinal tract harbors a complex commu-
nity containing more than 100 trillion microbial cells, which
influence human physiology, nutrition, and metabolism.
Intestinal bacteria play a role in vitamin B and vitamin K
synthesis, as well as metabolizing bile acids, sterols, and
xenobiotics. Moreover, commensal bacteria have the poten-
tial to activate the immune system. Stimulatory signals pro-
vided by microflora together with the epithelial barrier
system provides the first line of defense against pathogens.7
Recently, extensive research on the influence of gut micro-
biota on human health and disease points in the direction of
intestinal flora modification in the prevention and treatment
of gastrointestinal disorders.8 Huge progress in high-
throughput sequencing technologies leading to phylogenetic
assignment of 16S rRNA sequences from gut or stool sam-
ples as well as parallel recent developments in nongenomic
techniques is rapidly increasing our knowledge of the resi-
dent species.9,10
Multiple indications for probiotics include gastrointes-
tinal disorders, prevention and treatment of infectious
and antibiotic-induced diarrhea,11 and treatment of liver
insufficiency,12 lactose intolerance,13 inflammatory
bowel disease,14 and irritable bowel syndrome.15 The main
use of probiotics in cancer care is in the treatment of intes-
tinal toxicity during both chemotherapy and radiation.
Clinical studies showed fewer episodes of high-grade
diarrhea and less abdominal discomfort in cancer patients
receiving probiotic strains when undergoing chemother-
apy16,17 or abdominal and pelvic radiation.18,19 No adverse
effects of a serious nature have been reported after probi-
otic consumption in generally healthy people.20 However,
some case reports have identified probiotic strains used in
therapy to be involved with sepsis. At least 8 cases of
Lactobacillus bacteremia21-26 and 9 cases of overt sepsis
associated with Saccharomyces boulardii (cerevisiae),
Lactobacillus GG, Bacillus subtilis, Bifidobacterium
breve, or combination probiotics have been reported.27-33
Moreover, S cerevisiae fungemia has been described in
immunosuppressed (19 patients [31%]) and critically ill
patients (28 [46%]), indicating that probiotics should be
carefully used, particularly in patients with weakened
immune systems.34
Currently, there is lack of data regarding the exact prev-
alence of probiotic use in cancer patients in the literature.
Before starting probiotic use, each cancer patient should
discuss the potential risks/benefits of use, according to
evidence-based medicine, with the oncologist or pharma-
cist, taking into account current immune status. However,
it is estimated that 38% to 60% of patients with cancer do
not inform their doctor, pharmacist, or nurse about taking
nutritional supplements.1 An open market for probiotics is
expanding worldwide despite little research on consumer
characteristics. Here, we present a survey of probiotic use
and the association with patient tumor characteristics in
cancer patients treated at the outpatient department of the
National Cancer Institute in Slovakia.
Patients and Methods
In this survey, cancer patients undergoing treatment in the
outpatient department hospitalized at the National Cancer
Institute between March and December 2014 were included.
All patients were required to provide written informed con-
sent before enrollment and were asked to evaluate their
overall experience with probiotic use during the course of
their disease. The relevant data were collected by special
questionnaire filled out by a pharmacist based on individual
interview with patients. Questionnaire forms included ques-
tions about probiotic brand name, the initial source of infor-
mation about the possibility of probiotic use, the length and
method of use relative to anticancer therapy, expectations,
side-effect experiences, and any changes detected after pro-
biotic use. The study protocol was reviewed and approved
by the Ethical Committee of the National Cancer Institute
of Bratislava, Slovakia.
Statistics
Patient characteristics were summarized and tabulated
using the mean or median (range) for continuous variables
and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables.
Analyses of association between probiotic use and patients/
tumor characteristics were performed using a t-test for con-
tinuous variables, whereas Fisher's exact test or the 2 test
when appropriate was used for categorical variables. All
reported P values were 2 sided. For all statistical analyses,
a P value <.05 was considered as significant. Statistical
analyses were performed using NCSS 2007 software (J
Hintze, 2007, Kaysville, UT).

Results
Patient Characteristics
In total, 499 patients were included in the presented survey.
The cohort of patients consisted of 323 women (64.7%) and
176 men (35.3%); 91.6% were undergoing chemotherapy
(2.6% together with radiotherapy), and 8.4% had no antican-
cer therapy. The 3 most frequent diagnoses were gastrointes-
tinal tumors (26.1%), breast cancer (19.1%), and lymphomas
(14.4%). Two patients had more than 1 cancer diagnosis.
Mean age of patients was 58.5 ± 0.56 years, and 50.7% of all
patients belonged to the early old age category (60-74 years).
Patient characteristics and distribution of the entire cohort
according to cancer type are presented in Table 1.
Association Between Probiotic Use and Patient/
Tumor Characteristics
The prevalence of probiotic use recorded in our cohort of
patients was 28.5%, and all of them used probiotics in sup-
plemental pill form. The duration of use has been divided
into the following ranges: 1 month, 43.7%; >1 month to
6 months, 32.4%; >6 months to 12 months, 12.7%; >12
months, 9.9%. More female than male patients had used
probiotics during the course of their disease (72.5% vs
27.5%; P < .023). Our data showed that the highest
percentage of cancer patients using probiotics (42.3%) were
in a group referred to as the early old age category (60-74
years). The mean ages of probiotic-positive compared with
probiotic-negative patients were 56.2 ± 1.1 years to 59.4 ±
0.6 years, respectively.
Considering the entire cancer spectrum, the highest pro-
portion of probiotic-positive patients was detected in the
group with gastrointestinal tumors (22.5%), and breast and
gynecological cancer (21.1% and 15.5%, respectively).
Interestingly, data about the use within individual cancer
diagnoses showed that 50% of multiple myeloma patients
were taking probiotics. On the other hand, the percentage of
probiotic-positive brain cancer patients was only 11%.
However, the brain cancer group consisted of only 9
patients.
A statistically significant correlation was found (Table 2)
between probiotic use and age of patients (P < .008), gender
(P < .023), and taking other dietary supplements (P <
.000002). A correlation between cancer type and probiotic
use was not observed. However, we noticed a trend close to
statistical significance in the case of gynecological malig-
nancies (P < .061).
Based on the brand names of used probiotics stated by
patients, our results showed that there was preference for pro-
biotic preparations consisting predominantly of Lactobacillus
andBifidobacteriumstrains(Table3).Overall,Lactobacillus
and Bifidobacterium species are the most commonly used
probiotic bacteria characterized as live active cultures and
"good bacteria" for improving digestive balance. The
majority of patients considered taking probiotics on recom-
mendation from their doctor (37.3%), relatives (23.2%),
media information (17.6%), the pharmacist (14.8%), and
other patients (5.6%).
Relative to anticancer therapy, 28.9% of patients used
probiotics together with chemotherapy, whereas 69.7%
decided to take them on other days. A beneficial effect was
described by 61.3% of patients, whereas 35.2% observed no
effect (3.5% did not answer). However, 12 of 142 patients
(8.5%) using probiotics described negative side effects such
as diarrhea (41.7%), obstipation (16.7%), allergy (8.3%),
weight gain (8.3%), flatulence (8.3%), candidiasis (8.3%),
and rashes (8.3%). The patients' most frequent favorable
expectations of probiotic consumption were digestion and
appetite improvement (16.9%), relief of pain and problems
with constipation or diarrhea (25.4%), immune system sup-
port and intestinal flora restoration (17.6%), cancer treat-
ment (4.2%), elimination of vomiting after chemotherapy
(3.5%), flatulence elimination (7%), and neutralization of
stomach acid (6.3%). Concerning potential risks, 13.4% of
Slovak cancer patients declared knowledge of risk informa-
tion. However, 86.6% of patients had no knowledge about
the potential risks associated with probiotics (Table 3).
According to available data, 202 of all 499 patients
(40.5%) enrolled in the survey took dietary supplements

other than probiotics. Results showed that 51% of the
patients who took supplements other than probiotics used
vitamin C; other frequently used items were vitamin B,
Mg2+, aloe vera, green barley, and oyster mushroom. In the
group of patients using probiotics, other supplements were
taken by 57%, whereas among non­probiotic users, 33.9%
used other supplements.
Discussion
In this survey, we aimed to point out the importance of the
issue of probiotic use in cancer patients. Compared with the
average population, cancer patients more often use vita-
mins, minerals, herbs, and other supplements, including
probiotics.35 Patients' decision to use complementary or
alternative medicine and dietary supplements, including
probiotics, depends on the severity of their disease and
experiences of side effects associated with the anticancer
treatment they received. Supplementation may also provide
a sense of control or of being actively involved in treatment.
Some patients viewed probiotics as alternatives to pharma-
ceutical drugs and understood probiotics as a more natural,
low-risk therapeutic option.36 Recent experimental studies
have suggested possible antitumor effects of probiotics
mediated by their anti-inflammatory effects, especially in
breast and colon cancer.37-39
As presented here, the prevalence of probiotic use in a
cohort of 499 Slovak cancer patients undergoing chemo-
therapy was recorded as 28.5%. From the clinical point of
view, an important finding was that 86.6% of patients
declared no knowledge about the potential risks associated
with probiotics. More than half of the patients reported con-
sidering probiotic intake based on recommendation either
from a physician (37.3%) or from a pharmacist (14.8%).
The safety of probiotic use in cancer patients has recently
become a very important issue these days, and the lack of
discussion between the physician and the patient raises seri-
ous questions. To ensure optimal patient care, oncologists
should take into account research findings and adequately
discuss all complementary approaches with their patients.
An active approach accompanied by knowledgeable expla-
nations of potential risk might help in the prevention of
adverse effects, such as the development of septic condi-
tions resulting from the reduced capability for microbial
clearance in immunocompromised or critically ill patients.
Several cases of Lactobacillus bacteremia and fungemia
have so far been reported in cancer patients.40,41 On the
other hand, our previous study did not show any safety
issues regarding septicemia caused by a probiotic strain in
neutropenic patients42; but outside of a clinical study, there
is no room for using probiotics.
More female than male patients had used probiotics dur-
ing the course of their disease in this survey (72.5% vs
27.5%; P < .023). This is in accord with other studies show-
ing that women, younger patients, and patients with higher
socioeconomic status more often use complementary and
alternative medicine.1 Patients with gastrointestinal tumors

used probiotics in the highest percentage, confirming the
observation that probiotics are mainly used alongside gas-
trointestinal treatment.43
To address the issue of side-effect experience, only
8.5% of patients using probiotics described negative
effects. More than 40% of them experienced diarrhea, but
we cannot exclude the fact that its primary cause might
have been anticancer treatment and not probiotic intake.
Other negative effects such as allergy, weight gain, flatu-
lence, candidiasis, obstipation, and rashes were only occa-
sionally observed.
As we have shown, there is a high percentage of patients
reaching for probiotics and other dietary supplements when
undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Damage to natural
protective barriers resulting from the frequent use of che-
motherapy, radiation therapy, and especially antibiotics fre-
quently leads to disruption of gut microbial balance
followed by mucositis and diarrhea. Reduction of side
effects associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy
represents the main interest in the use of probiotics as an
adjunctive therapy to anticancer treatment. Experimental
studies and some clinical studies suggest that lactic acid
bacteria might also have beneficial effects on the toxicity
associated with anticancer therapy.42,44-46
The prevalence of intake of other dietary supplements in
our cohort was 40.5%, showing that more cancer patients
preferred to use vitamins or herbs than probiotics (28.5%).
Our data showed that probiotic-using patients are more
likely to take other dietary supplements than non­probiotic-
using patients (57% vs 33.9%, respectively). The preva-
lence of supplement use in healthy individuals and cancer
patients has grown rapidly.47 Because supplements often
contain a mixture of biologically active chemical com-
pounds, many health risks might be associated with their
use. In addition, most dietary supplements have been tested
only in nonclinical studies, and there are insufficient data on
the safety and efficacy from clinical trials in humans.
Therefore, reliable communication between the treating
physician, and patients and their families about the use of
nutritional supplements and herbal products is necessary to
evaluate the possible interactions prior to the surgical treat-
ment as well as during chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The
patient should be informed about the inappropriateness of
using complementary products and probiotics, the use of
which could lead to interaction with the conventionally
used treatment or cause potentially life-threatening condi-
tions such as sepsis because of immunosuppression.
The survey presented here aimed to map the prevalence
of probiotic use in cancer patients and find any correlation
with patient characteristics. However, its major limitation is
the fact that data apply mostly to outpatients undergoing
chemotherapy, and we cannot state the situation in patients
treated only with radiation therapy. Moreover, only a lim-
ited number of cancer patients not currently undergoing
treatment were included in this survey. Probiotics are clas-
sified as dietary supplements, and their quality should be
evaluated based on viability of the bacteria, bacterial types,
and enteric protection of the product if it includes bacteria
incapable of passage through stomach acid. The lack of
information about quality and dosage of probiotic bacteria
and subjective lifestyle and diet that might interact with
probiotics might cause a bias in estimation of the positive/
negative effects of probiotics in outpatients. However, this
survey did not aim to assess the impact of probiotics taken
while undergoing cancer treatment on the improvement of
patients' health status. For this purpose, further studies and
clinical trials need to be performed.
In conclusion, in this prospective study, we present for
the first time data about the prevalence, side-effect experi-
ences, and characteristics that most likely influence probi-
otic use in cancer patients. Our results have shown
differences in probiotic use related to age, gender, cancer
type, and decision to take other dietary supplements.
According to our data, minimal knowledge of potential
risk in this patient group underlined the importance of
adequate communication between oncologists and patients
as the key to forming a safe alliance between conventional
and complementary medicine. However, the currently
available literature is not well equipped to answer ques-
tions on the safety and efficacy of probiotics in cancer
patients treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
More research and especially well-designed clinical trials
would give the physicians relevant data for evidence-
based medicine.
