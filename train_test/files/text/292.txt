Purpose: Many older adults have inadequate health-
related literacy, which is associated with poor health
outcomes. Thus, it is important to identify determinants
of health literacy. We investigated relationships be-
tweenhealthliteracyandgeneralcognitiveandsensory
abilities, as well as education, health, and dem-
ographic variables, in a community sample of middle-
aged and older adults. Design and Methods: Partici-
pants were 314 community-dwelling adults (67%
female, 48% African American) diagnosed with
chronic heart failure recruited for a pharmacist-based
intervention study to improve adherence to chronic
heart failure medications. We adminstered demo-
graphic, health, education, cognitive (e.g., processing
speed, working memory), and sensory measures, and
the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults
(STOFHLA), as part of the baseline condition of this
study. Results: STOFHLA scores were lower for
participants who were older, less educated, male,
African American, had more comorbidities, or scored
lower on all cognitive ability measures. Hierarchical
linear regression analyses showed that education and
cognitive ability were independently associated with
the STOFHLA measure and explained age differences
in health literacy. Implications: The association of
cognitive abilities and literacy has important implica-
tions for health literacy models and for interventions to
reduce the impact of low health literacy on health
outcomes. For example, medication instructions should
be designed to reduce comprehension demands on
general cognitive abilities as well as literacy skills.
Key Words: Health literacy, Cognitive ability,
Health communication, Heart failure
Approximately half of the adults in the United
States have inadequate or marginal functional
health-related literacy, which challenges their ability
to navigate the health care system. Lower health
literacy is associated with poorer health status, less
health care knowledge, poorer self-care abilities
(e.g., medication adherence), reduced use of pre-
ventive services, and increased hospitalization and
health care costs (Ad Hoc Committee, 1999; DeWalt,
Berkman, Sheridan, Lohr, & Pignone, 2004; Nielsen-
Bohlman, Panzer, & Kindig, 2004). Thus, it is
important to identify people with less than adequate
health literacy and determine the reasons why this is
so. We investigated health literacy among middle-
aged and older adults with chronic heart failure
(CHF), a common chronic illness that requires a
high level of self-care (American Heart Association,
1999). Effective self-management of CHF may
impose heavy demands on health-related literacy.
More specifically, we focused on relationships
between health literacy and cognitive abilities to
better understand which skills and abilities are im-
paired in low-literacy patients. This knowledge, in
turn, could lead to a more comprehensive model of
the antecedents of health literacy and consequences
for health care. Such a model would help explain
associations between health literacy and demograph-
ic variables such as age and race, which researchers
have investigated because of their interest in health
literacy as a mediator of differences in health care

outcomes related to socioeconomic status (Ad Hoc
Committee, 1999; DeWalt et al., 2004). The model
would also guide development of strategies for
mitigating effects of low literacy on health behaviors
and outcomes.
We adapted an initial model, presented in Figure
1, from Nielson-Bohlman and colleagues (2004, p.
33) and elaborated on it in terms of theories of
comprehension (Kintsch, 1998) and cognitive deter-
minants of self-care (Park & Jones, 1997). It
organizes what is already known about correlates
of health literacy and frames the issues motivating
our study. Ratzan and Parker (2000, pp. ix) has
defined health literacy as the `` . . . capacity to obtain,
process, and understand basic health information
and services needed to make appropriate health
decisions.'' This definition links health literacy, like
the broader concept of literacy, to a wide range of
skills such as comprehension of linguistic, graphic,
and numeric information (Nielsen-Bohlman et al.).
Although comprehension is central to the concept of
health literacy, investigators rarely use theories of
comprehension to analyze this critical concept.
Health literacy is related to more general forms of
literacy, which is composed of an array of processes
such as recognizing words, accessing word meaning
representations from long-term memory, analyzing
sentence structure to combine word meanings into
propositions (representing the ``idea units'' conveyed
by clauses), and identifying relationships between
current and previously read propositions to con-
struct a text-level representation (Kintsch, 1998).
Readers interpret this latter representation in terms
of knowledge about the world in order to create
a situation model, which represents the situations
described in the text (Kintsch). The situation model
links language to behavior and determines whether
comprehension meets the demands of health care
contexts. For example, understanding instructions
for taking a diuretic requires relating the instructions
to knowledge about the medication and illness in
order to create a plan for taking the medication. It is
important to note that these processes depend on
speed of mental processing, working memory, and
other general cognitive abilities. If processes such as
accessing word meanings and combining them into
propositions take more time (e.g., due to age-related
slowing), then these processes will likely increase
demands on working memory and thereby reduce
comprehension. We next consider how health
literacy relates to demographic, education, and
cognitive and sensory variables (Figure 1).
Demographic and Education Variables
Researchers have found age-related decreases for
health literacy as well as general literacy measures that
are not fully explained by differences in health status
(Gazmararian et al., 1999; Schillinger et al., 2002;
Williams, Davis, Parker, & Weiss, 2002). African

American and Hispanic middle-aged and older adults
tend to score lower than non-Hispanic White or Asian
adults on standard health literacy measures (Arnold
et al., 2001; Bennett et al., 1998; Gazmararian et al.;
Schillinger et al.). These differences partly reflect
health differences, because African American adults
are more likely than non-Hispanic White adults to
have chronic conditions (Lafata, Pladevall, Divine,
Heinen, & Philbin, 2004) that compromise cognition
(Izquiero-Porrea & Waldstein, 2002).
Number of years of education often explains large
amounts of variance in health literacy as well as
general literacy measures (Baker, Gazmararian,
Sudano, & Patterson, 2000; Gazmararian et al., 1999;
Schillinger et al., 2002). Education may enhance
literacy by systematically imparting comprehension
strategies (e.g., drawing inferences) and accelerating
reading experience by promoting successful engage-
ment with text, which automatizes word recognition
processes and increases the knowledge that supports
situation models (Stanovich, West, & Harrison, 1995).
However, number of years of education does not
fully explain differences in general literacy (e.g.,
Barnes, Tager, Satariano, & Yaffe, 2004; Manly,
Jacobs, Touradji, Small, & Stern, 2002) or health
literacy (Andrus & Roth, 2002). This may reflect the
fact that the number of school years a person has is
a poor measure of educational attainment (Baker,
Parker, Williams, Clark, & Nurss, 1997; Manly et al.)
or that the many years of post-education reading
experience is more important than formal education
for determining literacy (Stanovich, West, & Harri-
son, 1995). Similarly, controlling for age differences
in education often attenuates but does not eliminate
age differences in literacy (Baker et al., 2000).
Cognitive Abilities and Health Literacy
Education, cognitive ability, and literacy are
intertwined, although it is difficult to unravel the
direction of causality. Education often improves
cognitive function as well as literacy, but the more
cognitively adept are also likely to advance further
in education and create opportunities for cognitive
growth (Gottfredson & Dreary, 2004; Perfetti, 1994).
Still, there is evidence that cognition (e.g., working
memory capacity) relates more to literacy than to
years of education among older adults (Barnes et al.,
2004; Manly et al., 2002). Therefore, it is likely that
cognitive differences help explain the effects of
education and demographic variables such as age on
literacy. Differences in sensory abilities may also
mediate the effects of age on literacy because sensory
and cognitive abilities are increasingly coupled in
advanced age (Lindenberger & Baltes, 1994). This
conclusion is consistent with evidence that age-related
differences in cognitive abilities partly mediates
relationships between age and self-care (Park &
Jones, 1997). Although Baker and colleagues (2000)
found that a global measure of cognitive impairment
(the Mini-Mental State Examination) was not asso-
ciated with age-related differences in health literacy,
they did not measure cognitive abilities more directly
related to comprehension. For example, successful
comprehension requires integrating current with
previously read information, and integration is more
successful to the extent previous information is easy
to access from working memory (Kintsch, 1998).
Thus,individual differencesin workingmemorycapa-
city, processing speed, or other cognitive abilities may
explain differences in health literacy.
Figure 1 also suggests that education influences
literacy via paths other than cognition by serving as
a marker for broader cultural factors. Highly
educated adults more likely than less educated adults
to share cultural norms and beliefs with health care
professionals, which enables them to more easily
access and understand health-related information or
predisposes them to accept the information as
relevant (Nielsen-Bohlman et al., 2004). We did not
investigate these factors in the present study.
Study Objectives
Previous studies have found that the association of
health literacy with demographic variables is partly
mediated by education. However, the association
between literacy and cognitive abilities is less well
established. In the current study, we examined
whether health literacy in a diverse sample of adults
with CHF was related to sensory and cognitive
abilities (independent of education) and whether these
relationships mediated effects of demographic varia-
bles on literacy.
Methods
We recruited a volunteer sample of 314 community-
dwelling middle-aged and older adults who had been
diagnosed with CHF and were taking at least one CHF
medication for participation in a pharmacy-based
patient education intervention study for improving
adherence to CHF medications. Recruitment was
through a Midwestern, county-managed urban hos-
pital (for details, see Murray, Young, et al., 2004).
Participants completed all measures reported in this
article during baseline data collection and before
random assignment to intervention or usual care
control groups in the adherence study.
A self-report questionnaire administered at
study recruitment measured demographic variables
(age, gender, race) and education. Participants self-
identified their racial group by choosing from a set of
options. For the regression analyses, we coded racial
group as African American or Other. We measured
health status with the New York Health Association
classification of CHF functional status (Critical
Committee, 1964) and by the Charlson Comorbidity
Index (Charlson, Pompei, Alex, & MacKensie, 1987).
Vol. 46, No. 5, 2006 671
We measured health-related literacy with the
reading component of the Short Test of Functional
Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA; Baker,
Williams, Parker, Gazmararian, & Nurss, 1999).
This test requires about 7 min to administer and mea-
sures the ability to read and understand actual
health-related passages with readability levels of 4.3
and 10.4 grade level (Gunning­Fog Index). Scores on
this version of the test range from 0 to 36 (0­16 =
inadequate health literacy, 17­22 = marginal liter-
acy, and 23­36 = adequate literacy) and tend to
decline with age (Baker et al., 2000).
We measured visual function with the Snellen
Chart, a standardized test of visual acuity consisting
of a chart with a series of letters in gradually decreas-
ing sizes placed at a standard distance from the sub-
ject. We assessed auditory function with the Speech
Discrimination Screening Task, part of the Arizona
Battery for Communication Disorders of Dementia
(Bayles & Tomoeda, 1993), which tests the ability to
discriminate word pairs that differ only in the first
phoneme (e.g., ``bare'' and ``dare''). We assessed
speech comprehension with the Revised Token Test
(McNeil & Prescott, 1978), which requires listeners to
manipulate objects of varying size, shape, and color
in response to spoken instructions. This test has
discriminated children with various neurological or
linguistic deficits from normally developing children,
in part because of the working memory demands
of comprehension (Aram & Ekelman, 1987). We
measured verbal working memory, or the ability to
simultaneously store and manipulate verbal informa-
tion, directly with the Listening Span task. In this task,
participants answer questions about progressively
larger sets of simple spoken sentences (1­6 sentences)
and then recall the final word of each sentence in the
set (for details on materials and scoring, see Salthouse
& Babcock, 1990). The workingmemory measure was
the size of the sentence set for which the participant
could reliably recall the sentences' final words. Age-
related differences on this task account for part of the
age-related variance in reasoning and memory tasks
(Salthouse & Babcock). We measured processing
speed with the Letter Comparison and Pattern Com-
parison tasks (Salthouse, 1991). In these timed paper-
and-pencil tasks, participants decide as rapidly as
possible whether pairs of letter sets or line patterns are
the same or different. Age differences on these tasks
account for age-related variance in verbal reasoning
(Salthouse) and memory (Park et al., 1996) tasks.
Results
Plan of Analysis
To test whether health-related literacy in a diverse
sample of adults with CHF was associated with
sensory and cognitive abilities and whether these
associations mediated effects of demographic vari-
ables on literacy, we conducted the following re-
gression analyses organized in terms of Figure 1. First,
in a set of simple linear regressions, we regressed raw
STOFHLA scores on each predictor to examine the
strength of the relationships between the predictors
and the health literacy measure. These analyses helped
develop models for the multiple regression analyses.
Second, we assessed which of the variables that
had been significant in the simple linear analyses
predicted health literacy when the influence of the
other variables was controlled. Following Figure 1,
we first examined the association of the demographic
and health variables (age, race, gender, and health as
indexed by the comorbid measure entered together)
with the STOFHLA measure (Step 1). We then
examined whether the effects of these variables
remained significant when we entered education into
the equation (Step 2). Rather than present all higher-
order regression models (e.g., effects of demograph-
ics and education with cognitive but not sensory
variables controlled), we present here a parsimonious
model that accounts for the most variability in health
literacy with the fewest predictor variables (Step 3).
For comparison, we also present the model with all
variables entered (Step 4).
Participants
The majority (67%) of participants (age range,
47­89 years old) were female. With respect to race,
48% of participants were African American, 49%
were non-Hispanic White, 2% were Asian, and 1%
were Native American. Forty percent of participants
scored at the two most severe levels of the New York
Heart Association measure for CHF function (Level
1 [least severe] = 19%, Level 2 = 41%, Level 3 =
35%, and Level 4 [most severe] = 5%). In addition,
participants reported on average 3.2 co-morbid
conditions and took a mean of 9.5 medications
(SD= 3.6) at the time of the study. Almost one third
(28%) of participants had marginal or inadequate
health-related literacy (STOFHLA score , 16). This
was consistent with previous studies with older adult
samples (e.g., Gazmararian et al., 1999) and in-
dicated an adequate range of scores to investigate
correlates of health literacy.
Simple Linear Regression Analyses of
Health Literacy
We examined associations between the STOFHLA
measure and the demographic, health, and cognitive/
sensory measures. Table 1 presents mean and
standard deviation values for the continuous de-
mographic and individual difference variables. This
table also presents the demographic and individual
difference scores separately for the African American
and Other groups. Typical of health literacy and
cognitive aging studies, age was negatively associated
with the health literacy measure (r =À.11, p , .05)
and with the cognitive and sensory ability measures
(rsÀ.14 toÀ.34, ps , .05). Table 2 presents results of
672 The Gerontologist
these regression analyses with STOFHLA scores
separately regressed on each predictor. The scores
were lower for participants who were male, African
American, older, less educated, had more comorbid-
ities, or scored lower on all cognitive ability measures
as well as on the speech discrimination test. Literacy
was not significantly associated with the Snellen test
or the New York Health Association measure. A
comparison of the R2 values directly obtained from
the regression model fitting procedure (which is
interpreted as the percentage of the variation in the
criterion variable explained by the regression model)
showed that education (R2 =21.83) and the cognitive
measures (Comparison Test R2 = 29.4; Revised
Token Test R2 = 26.64) accounted for the largest
amount of variability in health literacy.
Hierarchical Multivariate Regression
Analyses of Health Literacy
We next examined which patient variables pre-
dicted health literacy while controlling for relation-
ships among these predictors (for example, Table 1
shows that African American participants were
slightly older--and scored lower on the cognitive
measures--compared to other participants). Table 3
shows that, for the multivariate regressions with only
demographic variables entered (Step 1), these vari-
ables had similar relationships with literacy com-
pared to the simple linear regressions. Adding years
of formal education to the model (Step 2) accounted
for 18% more variance in health literacy and reduced
by approximately one half the relationship of health
literacy with age, gender, and comorbidities. Adding
the processing speed measure (Step 3) explained an
additional 13% of the variance beyond that ac-
counted for by the demographic variables and
education, and accounted for some of the effects of
race, gender, and the comorbidity variable on
literacy. Finally, entering all of the cognitive and
sensory variables into the same model (Step 4)
accounted for only an additional 3% of the variance
and did not change the pattern of findings. Other

models showed that controlling for the cognitive
measures but not education eliminated a significant
independent relationship between age and health
literacy, whereas this was not the case for the two
sensory variables (also see Baker et al., 2000).
Discussion
Summary
Education and cognitive ability measures were
independently associated with the STOFHLA mea-
sure in a diverse sample of adults with CHF, and
either variable explained age differences in health
literacy. Race and gender remained significant
predictors with education and cognitive variables
controlled but explained little variance in literacy.
In other studies, education was associated with the
STOFHLA measure but did not eliminate significant
associations of age and health literacy when con-
trolled (e.g., Baker et al., 2000). This may reflect
differences in samples across studies. For example,
because mean participant age was higher in Baker
and colleagues' (2000) study than in our study (73 vs
63 years, respectively), the association of age and
literacy may have been greater in the former study.
Health Literacy and Cognitive Function
Perhaps the most interesting finding from our
study was that cognitive ability explained so much
variance in health literacy with education controlled.
The finding that processing speed was more pre-
dictive than the working memory measure of health
literacy (Step 3) may reflect limitations on the
working memory measure because performance on
the listening span task was generally low, with limited
variability. Indeed, in an earlier study we found that
differences in patients' memory for CHF medication
instructions were related to health literacy, which
could be partly explained by differences on a working
memory measure (Morrow et al., 2005).
The relationship between processing speed and
health literacy is unlikely due (only) to the fact that
the STOFHLA is a timed test. Processing speed
measures have also been found to predict perfor-
mance on untimed cognitive tasks (involving com-
prehension, memory, and reasoning; e.g., Salthouse,
1991). Adults with reduced speed of processing are
likely to more slowly access word meanings and
integrate them into a coherent text representation,
which may impair comprehension. Thus, individual
differences in health literacy among middle-aged and
older adults partly reflect differences in mental
processing speed and other fundamental cognitive
mechanisms, as predicted by theories that identify
such mechanisms as constraints on comprehension
efficiency (Kintsch, 1998; Wingfield & Stine-Morrow,
2000). Baker and colleagues (2000) found that age-
related declines in literacy were reduced but not
eliminated by a global measure of cognitive function
(the Mini-Mental State Examination). As suggested
by these authors, this may reflect the lack of direct
measures of specific cognitive abilities in that study.
Sensory measures did not predict health literacy in
the present study (also see Baker et al., 2000). Studies
with more complex visual function measures (which
likely share variance with cognitive measures) have
found associations of health literacy and sensory
functioning (Echt & Schuchard, 2004).
Relationships of health literacy to race were not
explained by differences in education and cognition.
Other studies have found that the impact of race on
cognitive performance is attenuated when control-
ling for education or other socioeconomic variables
(Aiken, Marsiske, & Whitfield, 2004). Perhaps

differences in the quality rather than amount of
education accounted for differences in health literacy
between racial groups in our study (Gazmararian
et al., 1999). Indeed, Manly and colleagues (2002)
found that differences between African American
and White older adults on standard cognitive ability
measures were reduced when controlling for differ-
ences on a general literacy measure, although this
latter measure may more directly reflect educational
attainment than quality of education. It is also
possible that the impact of race on health literacy
could have been mediated by unmeasured variables
in our study. For example, differences in community
resources such as level of civic engagement (social
capital) may have played a role.
Finally, men had lower STOFHLA scores than did
women in our study, whereas other studies have
tended to find no gender differences in STOFHLA
scores (Gazmararian et al., 1999) or have found
lower scores for women (e.g., Schillinger et al.,
2002). These different patterns likely reflect differ-
ences across samples related to socioeconomic status,
health, or other variables.
Study Limitations
In the present study, we measured health literacy
with the STOFHLA, but health literacy is a multi-
faceted concept that encompasses abilities in addi-
tion to comprehension skill--abilities such as
decision making and others needed to navigate the
health care system (e.g., Nielsen-Bohlman et al.,
2004). Therefore, any single measure may underes-
timate poor health literacy. For example, we likely
underestimated effects of cultural differences. This
may help explain why education was associated with
health literacy even after we controlled for other
factors, because cultural factors were likely corre-
lated with education (also see Beers et al., 2003). A
related limitation is that we did not measure
constructs related to social and cultural context in
our general model (Figure 1) in the present study.
Nonetheless, the association of the STOHFLA
measure with general cognitive abilities has several
implications for the importance of cognitive function
in daily health care. First, the comprehension abilities
tapped by the STOFHLA are a core set of skills related
to the broader concept of health literacy, as shown by
evidencethat performanceontheSTOFHLA isrelated
to health outcomes (for a review, see Nielsen-Bohlman
et al., 2004). Second, cognitive abilities are likely to
influence more abilities and behaviors than just
comprehension. For example, working memory meas-
ures explain age-related variance in medication
adherence (Park et al., 1999) and medical decision
making (Zwahr, Park, & Shifren, 1999).
A second limitation of this study relates to our
sample of chronically ill adults. Because chronic
illness such as CHF compromises cognitive function
(e.g., Elias, D'Agostino, Elias, & Wolf, 1995;
Izquiero-Porrea & Waldstein, 2002), it is difficult to
generalize our findings about the relationships
between cognitive ability and health literacy. An
important next step will be to investigate cognitive
ability and health literacy in samples of healthy elders.
A final caution relates to the correlational design of
our study. We identified associations between health
literacy and cognitive measures but did not establish
causal relationships. Although the model in Figure 1
suggests that cognitive deficits contribute to poor
health literacy, it is also possible that poor literacy
skills contribute to cognitive declines, perhaps by
reducing health. Prospective longitudinal studies that
also include measures of the sociocultural context may
disentanglerelationshipsbetweentheseimportantskill
domains and determine how they change over time.
Implications for Improving Health Literacy
The importance of cognitive abilities such as
mental processing speed for health literacy suggests
the value of training in basic cognitive skills for
improving literacy. Such training improves older
adults' performance on a variety of tasks (for a review,
see Kramer & Willis, 2002). The relationship between
cognitive abilities and literacy (Barnes et al., 2004;
Manly et al., 2002) suggests this would also be the
case for literacy. However, it is unclear to what extent
training in basic cognitive abilities ``scales up'' to
performance of complex everyday tasks (Kramer &
Willis, 2002). Therefore, basic cognitive training may
not be the most effective strategy for improving the
ability of older adults with inadequate literacy skills
to navigate the health care system.
The relationship between cognitive abilities and
health literacy suggests another approach to miti-
gating the impact of low health literacy on health
care. Simplifying tasks that tax health literacy skills
would reduce constraints on performance imposed
by declining cognitive abilities and limited compre-
hension skills. Researchers frequently suggest that
low-literacy participants will benefit from commu-
nication with simple language, pictorials, and other
characteristics that simplify comprehension (Ad Hoc
Committee, 1999; Doak, Doak, & Root, 1996). How-
ever, the relationship between general cognitive
abilities and health literacy identified in the present
study suggests that such strategies will only help low-
literacy patients if they reduce demands on general
as well as health-specific cognitive abilities. For ex-
ample, a sequence of pictorials may not help low-
literacy patients if these pictures must be mentally
integrated in order to be understood. Effective health
communication should reduce demands on cognitive
abilities (e.g., working memory) as well as on
language-specific abilities (e.g., word knowledge).
We are developing multimedia (text with pictures)
instructions for CHF medications that may improve
older adults' comprehension by addressing both
types of abilities (e.g., Morrow et al., 2005).
Vol. 46, No. 5, 2006 675
We plan to elaborate the model in Figure 1 to
encompass relationships between health literacy,
adherence, and health outcomes. A preliminary
analysis suggests that lower health literacy is as-
sociated with lower adherence to CHF medications
in our intervention study (Murray, Wu, et al., 2004).
We plan to investigate whether relationships be-
tween health literacy and adherence are mediated by
differences in cognitive abilities and whether these
relationships also mediate the impact of demo-
graphic variables on adherence and health outcomes.
Such findings would be consistent with functional
definitions that view health literacy in terms of how
individuals' skills match the demands of specific
health care tasks or contexts (DeWalt et al., 2004;
Nielsen-Bohlman et al., 2004).
