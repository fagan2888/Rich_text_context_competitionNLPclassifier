Introduction
The 10-nation, regional community, commonly known as
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN; 2005), is
an incredibly diverse and dynamic region whose population
in 2017 exceeded 639 million people, which at the end of
2016 had an economy valued at US$2.555 trillion (ASEAN
Economic Community [AEC], 2017).
Thailand is a key member of this community, and pro-
motes itself as the "hub" of many industrial and technol-
ogy sectors, such as automotive manufacturing, computer
disk drive manufacturing, smartphone mobile technology,
and renewable energies. And, whether a desired outcome
or not, Thailand has become a "hub" for an estimated 6.5
million, migrating intra-ASEAN foreign workers (mostly
unskilled; International Labour Organization and the Asian
Development Bank [ILOADB], 2014).
In this market, an International Labour Organization
(ILO; 2014) survey of ASEAN companies indicated that less
than one in three surveyed agreed that secondary school
graduates were equipped with the relevant skills needed by
their firms. Some good news, however, can be found in
another ASEAN ILO study, which indicated that 80% of
these same organizations felt it important to invest in human
resource development (HRD).Also, 90% of these same firms
reported that training investment is an important way to
address performance gaps, promote continuous development
of the workforce, and improve productivity
It seems, however, that ASEAN managers feel that educa-
tion beyond high school (tertiary education), especially
vocational education and training systems, is better aligned
with industry requirements. What was interesting to also
note from the survey was where the greatest skill gaps were,
with training needed greatest in management and leadership
skills (29.0%), then vocational training (17.0%), and cus-
tomer service training (15.0%; ILOADB, 2014).
Depending on which ASEAN country you choose to
establish your business in can also determine what skill
shortage a foreign manager might expect. In Cambodia,
communication and foreign language skills are in great
shortage (Bruni, Luch, & Kuoch, 2013). In Vietnam, the
World Bank (2014) company survey identified job-related
technical skills gaps, including problem solving, critical
thinking, teamwork, and communications. The study also
indicated that until these shortages are relieved, firms will be
faced with high staff turnovers, or having to fill skilled posi-
tions with marginally capable domestic workers, or having to
recruit skilled workers from other ASEAN member nations
(Aring, 2015).

Thai AEC Engineer Readiness: A
Confirmatory Factor Analysis
Duangporn Kraisuth1 and Vinai Panjakajornsak1
Abstract
At the start of 2016, the 10 nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) entered a new era. With it, came
the decade-old start of the implementation of the 2005 mutual recognition arrangement (MRA) on engineering services, and
the free flow of skilled labor (FFSL). Although created with noble intentions, actual specifications and qualifications for an
individual's foreign employment heavily restricts its actual implementation. This study, therefore, conducted a confirmatory
factor analysis using LISREL 9.1 software of 278 engineers selected from a population of 1,211 Thai Federation of Industries
companies to investigate how need, gap, and competency affect readiness. From the analysis, need was shown to have the
highest effect on readiness, whereas competency also had a direct effect on readiness. Finally, the research determined
that less than 1% of the surveyed engineers were certified as ASEAN engineers, which is a precondition for registration for
work as an engineer in another ASEAN country, and that cultural awareness of other member nations was perceived as the
weakest link in an individual's engineer readiness perception.

2 SAGE Open
The World Bank's (2014) Vietnam analysis of skill short-
ages and the need for foreign recruitment are already being
confirmed in Thailand; as in late 2016, the Thai government
announced a US$1 billion program to recruit/produce 12,290
postdoctoral researchers to meet the needs of 10 targeted
industries under the banner "Thailand 4.0" (Jones & Pimdee,
2017). This program is focused on technological develop-
ment and innovation, and in the first recruitment cycle of the
300 scholarships being awarded to produce doctoral research-
ers, 60 scholarships (20%) are targeted for researchers from
other ASEAN nations ("Govt Designs 20-Year Plan," 2016).
With tighter integration of the AEC at the start of 2016,
the ability for the free flow of skilled labor (FFSL) also
began (Sugiyarto & Agunias, 2014). The FFSL, combined
with the mutual recognition agreements (MRA), is designed
to allow AEC member countries to share their expertise
across borders, "without any legal limitations" (Chia, 2011;
Fukunaga, 2015). This, however, seems to be at odds with
the reality of the "fine print" within the documents concern-
ing "certification" and "qualifications."
A year has now gone by since the beginning of a new era
of AEC integration, and from all appearances, not much has
changed. This has, therefore, lead to the following state-
ments concerning the issues regarding Thai engineer readi-
ness to participate in AEC engineering projects, under the
existing MRA and FFSL regulations.
Problem Statement
The Thai government has announced "Thailand 4.0," which
focuses on technological development and innovation within
10 key industrial sectors. From subsequent announcements
concerning the funding and recruitment of 12,290 postdoc-
toral researchers (domestic and foreign), indications are a
critical shortage of "skilled knowledge workers" and engi-
neering expertise is looming. Furthermore, as Thailand looks
to other ASEAN markets to expand its own business pres-
ence, issues concerning engineer readiness are being raised.
Therefore, this study aimed to determine what level of readi-
ness (either perceived or real) Thai engineers have and what
are their "needs" and "gaps" in accomplishing work outside
Thailand, within anASEAN structure. Investigation included
engineer certification requirements, MRA agreements, lan-
guage skills, and cultural skills.
Literature Review
Readiness
The Korn Ferry Institute (2015) has indicated that individual
readiness is the crucial link between high potential and suc-
cess in a new job (which is not the same as potential), as
readiness is the ability to act "now." As a knock-on effect
from American's space program in 1974, and in a search for
a contractor support criterion, the technology readiness level
(TRL) metric was developed, which assessed the maturity of
evolving technologies prior to incorporating them into a sys-
tem or subsystem (Fedkin, 2015). This later became a stan-
dardmetricforcommunicationofatechnology'sdevelopment
status (Mankins, 2002).
Although the TRL is not a scale to directly measure an
engineer's readiness, it does, however, require a high level of
professional capability to search out the most recent informa-
tion, from a multitude of sources, concerning the characteris-
tics of new systems, prototypes, and competition, and being
able to justify the resultant cost and economic viability
(Fedkin, 2015). This is consistent with Davis, Beyerlein, and
Davis (2006), who investigated the roles that professional
engineers utilize in their careers, and indicated that informa-
tion retrieval and evaluation skills are important for five of the
10 readiness roles the study described, which included analyst,
problem solver, designer, researcher, and communicator.
Denham, Zinsser, and Bailey (2011) referred to emotional
intelligence (EQ) as emotional competence. Later, research
by Buzdar, Ali, and Tariq (2016) examined EQ's effect on
readiness, and determined that positive effects on students'
readiness for online learning.
The Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence
in Organizations (CREIO, 2016) identified 19 areas concern-
ing EQ importance, and its contribution to organizational
profitability. A similar meta-analysis study by Miao,
Humphrey, and Qian (2016) concluded that a manager's EQ
positively relates to a subordinate's job satisfaction. This is
consistent with Parke, Seo, and Sherf (2015), who also con-
cluded that a worker or manager's EQ is a key factor for
higher income and advancement, with Elegbe (2015) indicat-
ing that EQ was a missing priority in an engineering pro-
gram's education curriculum.
From a review of the literature and theory, four observed
variables were identified and added to the research frame-
work for readiness. These included the variables environ-
ment and emotion, motivation, and personality (EMP).
Competency
Astudy on the theory of competency can begin with Flanagan's
(1954) "Critical Incidents Technique," which is thought of as
a key methodology in competency studies. McClelland later
adopted Flanagan's work, which led to the adoption of the
term "competency," and the separation of "competency" and
"intelligence" (McClelland, 1973). This agrees with Gipps
and Stobart (2003), who defined "competent" as one's indi-
vidual experience and his or her related educational training,
rather than a natural feature such as intelligence.
The next milestone in competency modeling occurred when
Boyatzis (1982) introduced his book on competency modeling,
which emphasized the importance of systematic analysis.
Boyatzis also introduced the behavioral event interview (BEI),
which today is part of many interview processes for the Fortune
500, universities, and organizations such as the World Bank.
Kraisuth and Panjakajornsak 3
Myatt (2013) voiced concerns that when organizations
value technical competency more than personal competency
and an individual's "soft skills," the organization will miss
the real value of the individual. Knowledge, therefore, should
be used to inspire and create brilliance in others, and "Alead-
er's job is to close gaps--not create them" (Myatt, 2013).
More recently, from the development of Matveev's (2016)
collaborative intercultural competence model (CICM), it
was determined that the most crucial issue facing today's
global business leaders and their multicultural workforce is
how to relate effectively and work in an intercultural context.
As a component of this, Deardorff (2009) was surprised to
discover the lack of second-language learning and overseas
experience in the competencies identified as most important.
Implications from this suggested that language learning is
secondary to the basic motivational and cognitive orienta-
tions that permit movement in and among cultures, with or
without language competence.
Asamoah, Okuada, and Hayfor (2014) discussed compe-
tency as a tool and indicated there were three components
including knowledge (informational expertise such as in
automotive engineering); skills, which is the ability to dem-
onstrate one's expertise (such as in contract negotiations);
and finally, attitude, which involves how one perceives him-
self or herself.
Both Reeve (2016) also indicated the importance of com-
petency by stating it is the key to vocational and educational
training (VET). This is consistent with directives from the
European Union (2015), which state that lifelong learning
needs to be relevant, with high-quality knowledge, skills,
and competences developed throughout a person's career.
The focus of learning should also be employability, innova-
tion, active citizenship, and well-being.
From the above theories and scholars'concepts of compe-
tency, competency was frequently discussed in terms of three
elements. These were knowledge, skill, and attitude, and
were, therefore, placed into the research framework. From
this, the following hypotheses concerning competency were
developed:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Competency has a direct positive
effect on readiness.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): Competency has an indirect and posi-
tive effect on readiness through gap.
Need
From Accreditation Board for Engineering and Techno-
logy's (ABET) international engineering accreditation guide
"Accrediting Engineering Programs, 2016-2017," which is
currently being used in 30 countries, 752 colleges, and 3,709
engineering programs, the curriculum necessary for prepara-
tion of students in an engineering profession should include, in
part, (a) leadership, (b) professional ethics, (c) and recognition
and the ability to engage in lifelong learning (ABET; 2015).
As previously discussed, both the ILO and the ADB,
agree with this assessment (ILOADB, 2014). In addition,
ABET also indicated that responsibility must be instilled in
students in both a professional and ethical way. General
knowledge or basic knowledge is imperative as well, which
includes the necessary basics in the math and sciences to do
a job in a related engineering field.
After graduation, the concept of "need" is normally asso-
ciated with the discrepancy or gap between what the company
expects to happen, and what happens (Rouda & Kusy, 1995).
For example, if the company wants to promote an engineer to
a higher position that involves working and interacting with
foreigners from other ASEAN countries, that engineer will
need to improve his or her English proficiency (Joungtrakul,
2013). This discrepancy may become a reason for a training
or HRD need (Lim, Werner, & Desimone, 2013).
Many motivational theories are rooted in the concept of
needs, with needs being stated as deficiencies or imbalances,
either physiological or psychological, that drive or direct
employee behavior. Although needs are internal states of
individuals, they are influenced by forces in the companies
(Lim et al., 2013). Needs drive behavior through a combina-
tion of need activation and need satisfaction. Only activated
needs can be motivational, because only an activated need
generates the tension the person is motivated to get rid of
(Noe, Hollenbeck, Gerhart, & Wright, 2014)
Two well-known need-based theories of motivation are
Maslow's (1943) need hierarchy theory, and later, Alderfer's
(1969) existence, relatedness, and growth (ERG) theory.
Alderfer (1969) emphasized the importance of emotional
and material well-being, the desire to satisfy interpersonal
relationships, and the need for continual psychological
growth and development.
Further review of human motivation theories literature
identifies other popular scholars including McClelland's
"Need theory of motivation" (Royle & Hall, 2012), and the
basic needs theory (BNT; Deci & Ryan, 2000). McClelland's
(1965, 1973) need theory is particularly interesting as it
focuses on needs for motivation/achievement (nACH), affili-
ation (nAFF), and power (nPOW), which were indicated as
traits that can be learned.
Need theories tend to suggest that to motivate employee
learning, companies should identify employees' needs, fol-
lowed by informing the employee how each training pro-
gram relates to fulfilling his or her needs (Redmond &
Subedi, 2016).
From the above list of need theorists, Maslow's need hier-
archy theory is probably most recognized, which visualized
the theory in a hierarchy, ascending from the lowest to the
highest (Maslow, 1943). Lower ordered needs are experi-
enced first, which must be satisfied before higher ordered
needs are perceived. Therefore, before employees can be
trained and developed, it is important to determine what type
of training is necessary, and whether employees are willing
and ready to learn.
4 SAGE Open
In a discussion about "need" and the evaluation of it, there
is an operational definition problem of what exactly they are
and what it entails. It seems, at times, that "assessment" and
"analysis" are used interchangeably, but in fact, they are two
different ideas (Kaufman & Guerra-López, 2013), with
"assessment" designed to identify gaps in results, whereas
"analysis" seeks to understand the root causes.
In the United Sates, the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) has indicated that the purpose of a training needs
assessment is to identify performance requirements, and the
knowledge, skills, and abilities needed by personnel to
accomplish the requirements. This helps organizations direct
their resources to help with the organizational mission, its
productivity, and help with providing quality products and
services.
From the above theories, need has a multitude of elements
depending on a wide array of conditions and circumstances.
However, the researchers made their best effort to narrow the
discussion to professionals and management in engineering-
related disciplines. From this, the following observed vari-
ables were determined, which included ethics, collaborative
management, response management, leadership, lifelong
learning, and basic knowledge. From the above and other
scholars' research, the following hypotheses concerning
need were developed:
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Need has a direct positive influence
on gap.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): Need has a direct positive influence
on readiness.
Gap
Professional knowledge and skills have been thought of "soft
skills," and are frequently thought to include teamwork skills,
communication skills, and leadership skills (ABET, 2014;
Brunhaver, Korte, Barley, & Sheppard, 2016; Knight, 2012;
Shuman, Besterfield-Sacre, & McGourty, 2005). This is con-
sistent with survey data from the National Association of
Colleges and Employers (NACE; 2015), which indicated
that 75% of all hiring managers seek new graduates who can
work as a team, whereas 80% of the same managers were
looking for evidence of leadership skills, which had the
greatest influence over hiring one candidate over another.
Other priority skills can be seen in Figure 1.
From the Australian researchers Male, Bush, and
Chapman (2010), competency deficiencies in new graduates
were also referred to as "skill gaps," with the World Chemical
Engineering Council (WCEC) indicating that new engineer-
ing undergraduates' management and administration skills
having the highest gap levels (WCEC; 2004). Research from
Passow (2007) also concluded that there were 11 skills
required for industrial competency, and of these, the four
most important were (a) problem solving and communica-
tions skills, (b) ethics, (c) learning, and (d) teamwork.
Patil, Nair, and Codner (2008) studied competency gaps
and found that there were 23 related competency variables,
of which 10 variables were crucial. These included (a) oral
communication, (b) interpersonal skills, (c) written com-
munication, (d) solving problem, (e) new concept develop-
ment, (f) time management, (g) teamwork, (h) knowledge
application in working, (i) stress management, and (j)
learning new things.
Zaharin (2009) researched the perception gap between
employers and engineering undergraduates in Malaysia, and
found that there were six important competencies including
(a) communication, (b) problem solving, (c) teamwork, (d)
learning, (e) knowledge application in working, and (f) eth-
ics. In Thailand, Cheerakarn (2012) also discussed required
competencies in human resource staffing and identified the
following key attributes including innovation, leadership,
flexibility, motivation, and building relationships.
As aforementioned, there are a variety of competency gap
elements with management and teamwork being two strong
concepts, which were identified and included in the hypoth-
esized model depicted in Figure 2 and stated in the final
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 5 (H5): Gap has a direct and positive influ-
ence on readiness.
Hypothesized Framework
Based on the above hypotheses and review of the literature,
the researchers have developed Figure 2's conceptual frame-
work, which includes the causal relationships between com-
petency, gap, needs, and readiness of Thai professional
engineers to work within the AEC.

Method
Sample and Data Collection
The survey's population was engineers who worked in Thai
industrial companies registered by the Federation of Thai
Industries (FTI). For the study, the 1,211 companies were
divided into 12 industrial sectors (Table 1).
Of the questionnaires sent and returned, 412 question-
naires were deemed complete and usable, of which 278
respondents who affirmatively answered the survey question
"Are you prepared to work in another ASEAN country?"
were selected for further analysis.
Furthermore, the questionnaire was divided into two
parts, with Part 1 consisting of the respondent's general and
personal information, whereas Part 2 consisted of the actual
questionnaire concerning the engineer's perception of his or
her readiness for work within an AEC member country. Part
2 also consisted of 60 questions divided into four parts, with
competency consisting of 12 questions, needs with 24 ques-
tions, competency gap with 11 questions, and readiness with
11 questions (Tables 2 and 3). Respondents' perceptions of
their readiness were noted by use of a Likert-type agreement
scale (Likert, 1932) ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7
(strongly disagree).
Therefore, from the seven levels of frequency (Table 3),
the interpretation of these responses was calculated by using
the following formula:

Research Instrument Quality Verification
Questionnaire validation enhancement was accomplished in
a two-step process, which included the following:
1. Content validity was evaluated by using item-objec-
tive congruence (IOC) value, with the IOC value of
0.6 or more being considered satisfactory. The index
of IOC developed by Rovinelli and Hambleton
(1977) is a procedure used in test development for
evaluating content validity at the item development
stage. Using this criterion, the content validity was
reviewed by five researchers to determine the rele-
vancy and validity of the questions, including the
latent variables.
2. The reliability was estimated using Cronbach's alpha,
resulting in values ranging from .7 or greater (Tavakol
& Dennick, 2011).
Reliability
Thirty questionnaires were used in the initial reliability test
to ensure the responses collected through the instrument
were consistent and reliable, which was calculated with use
of Cronbach's alpha and was determined to be highly reliable
with a score of .958. George and Mallery (2010) illustrated
the value of Cronbach's alpha (Table 4), although some
authors suggest higher values of .90 to .95 should be used
(Tavakol & Dennick, 2011).
Quantitative Data Analysis
The study identified two exogenous latent variables,
which consisted of two observed variables (Hancock &
Nevitt, 1999), including competency (knowledge, skill,
and attitude) and need (ethics, collaborative management,
response management, leadership, lifelong learning, and
basic knowledge).
The study also identified a mediator latent variable, which
was gap. Gap consisted of two observed or manifest vari-
ables, including management and teamwork. Mediating vari-
ables are important in psychological theory and research, and
transmit the effect of an independent variable on a dependent
variable (MacKinnon, Fairchild, & Fritz, 2007).
In addition, the endogenous latent variables relating to
readiness consisted of environment and EMP. Readiness was
identified as the moderator variable of the research. From the
literature review and theory, Table 5 shows the exogenous,
mediator, and the endogenous latent variables, along with
their related observed variables and supporting theory.
Qualitative Data Analysis
The UCLA Statistical Consulting Group (2016) has sug-
gested sample sizes typically range between five and 15
items per estimated parameter, with sample sizes greater than
200 cases, but vary depending on the complexity of the spec-
ified model. Nunnally and Bernstein (1994) suggested a
middle number of 10 cases per variable as being sufficient.
Therefore, from the above and other reviewed theory, a ratio
of 20:1 was deemed to be highly reliable. Thus, the study's
278 individuals for 13 observed variables (13 × 20 = 260)
were deemed to be highly reliable.
Qualitative research was conducted by use of in-depth,
semistructured, guided interviews with five experts (three
university engineering lecturers and two engineers certified
from the Council of Engineers of Thailand [COE]) to deter-
mine the questionnaire's content validity, which covered the
following five topics. Revision was based on the comments
and feedback from each expert.
1. the measurement of readiness,
2. the measurement of competency,
3. the measurement of gap, and
4. the measurement of need.
Results
Respondent's Demographic Characteristics
Table 6 shows the results from the 278 Thai engineering pro-
fessionals surveyed, the majority were male (85.0%) and
were 40 years old or younger (80.80%). Engineers with
undergraduate degrees represented 74%, while 19.90% had a
master's degree. Civil engineers (38.80%) led the profes-
sional list, followed by electrical engineers (18.90%) and
mechanical engineers (14.80%). Engineers involved in oper-
ations represented 64.80%, while engineering managers rep-
resented 35.20%. The operations/management ratio was
nearly a mirror of the experience ratio, which indicated that
63.11% had 10 years of experience or less, while the remain-
ing (36.85%) had 11 years or more experience.
When the survey focused on professional membership in
the "Council of Engineers of Thailand (COE)," 36.20% indi-
cated that they were not a member, whereas 51.20% indi-
cated they were registered as "associate engineers," with
another 11% registered at higher levels. Although 67.50%
indicated in the first part of the survey that they were "ready"
to work outside Thailand as a professional engineer in the
Kraisuth and Panjakajornsak 7
AEC, only 0.72% (two individuals) had achieved "ASEAN
Chartered Professional Engineer (ACPE)" status. It is ACPE
certification that allows a Thai engineer to work outside
Thailand in another AEC country (Council of Engineers of
Thailand, 2010).
For clarification, Thailand's COE is a statutory body under
the Engineers Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which provided for the
registration of professional engineers, and the associated
qualifications and conduct regulations for both them and the
Thai companies they work for (Council of Engineers, 2016).
Respondent's Information
Table 7 shows that the factors that affect Thai engineering
professional readiness to work within the ASEAN commu-
nity (AEC) includes readiness, competency, gap, and need,
whereas Table 8 shows the specific questions in Part 4 (read-
iness) and each question's M and standard deviation aver-
ages, as well as the interpreted results from the 7-point
survey, which ranged from 4.87 to 5.84 (Best & Kahn, 2003;
Likert, 1932).
Pearson Product­Moment Correlation (PPMC)
Coefficient
The PPMC coefficient (r) was used to calculate the direction
and strength between the constructs, with Table 9 showing
the results of the 13 variables tested. Cohen (1988) has stated
that the sign of the correlation coefficient indicates the direc-
tion of the relationship, whereas the magnitude of the corre-
lation (how close it is to -1 or +1) indicates the strength of
the relationship. Table 9 shows the results from the study,
which indicate the positive relationships. In addition, the
variables are most correlated at the statistically significant
level of p < .05. The study also considered the pairs of
observed variables' correlation coefficients (Table 9) where
values were above .85. The empirical data showed that the
correlation coefficient was between .111 and .814, and
because this was below .85, the researchers, therefore, con-
cluded that multicollinearity was not a problem (Pumim,
Srinuan, & Panjakajornsak, 2017; Studenmund, 2006).
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
Magistris and Gracia (2008) stated that to access the mea-
surement models, a CFA is used followed by structural equa-
tion modeling (SEM) to examine the general fit of the
proposed model with data, and to identify the overall rela-
tionships among these constructs. Wong (2013) indicated
also that, for marketing research, a significance level of 5%,
a statistical power of 80%, and R2 values of at least .25 are
considered typical.
Standard modeling accepts the proposed model if the p
value is higher than .05 and if the 2/df ratio is less than two

(Byrne, Shavelson, & Muthén, 1989). This is consistent with
Kline (1998) and Ullman (2001), who also indicated that the
relative chi-square should be less than two.
In addition, another common reported statistic, and a
potential mechanism for accommodating large sample sizes,
is to use the root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA), as a measure of goodness-of-fit in SEMs (Chen,
Curran, Bollen, Kirby, & Paxton, 2008; Steiger, 2007) and to
measure the discrepancy per degree of freedom (Hu &
Bentler, 1999).
Competency
Using SEM, the researchers specified the CFA model (Hox
& Bechger, 1998), where competency (Figure 3) is influ-
enced by knowledge, skills, and attitude. From the modeling,
the 2 was indicated to be 0.54, with a p value of .764, and
RMSEA = 0.000, which indicates an acceptable fit with the
model. This ensures that the observed variables are sensitive
to competency and are suitable for further analysis.
Need
Using SEM, the researchers specified the CFA model (Hox
& Bechger, 1998), where need (Figure 4) is influenced by
ethics, collaborative management, response management,
leadership, lifelong learning, and basic knowledge. From the
modeling, the 2 was indicated to be 0.54, with a p value of
.764 and RMSEA = 0.000, which indicates an acceptable fit
with the model. This ensures that the observed variables are
sensitive to need and are suitable for further analysis.
Gap
Using SEM, the researchers specified the CFA model (Hox
& Bechger, 1998) where gap (Figure 5) is influenced by
management and teamwork. From the modeling, the 2 was
indicated to be 0.54, with a p value of .764 and RMSEA =
0.000, which indicates an acceptable fit with the model. This
ensures that the observed variables are sensitive to gap and
are suitable for further analysis.
Readiness
Using SEM, the researchers specified the CFA model (Hox

by environment and EMP. From the modeling, the 2 was
indicated to be 0.54, with a p value of .764 and RMSEA =
0.000, which indicates an acceptable fit with the model. This
ensures that the observed variables are sensitive to readiness
and are suitable for further analysis.
Scholars such as Hooper, Coughlan, and Mullen (2008)
and Hair, Hult, Ringle, and Sarstedt (2016) have stated items
with low multiple R2 (less than .20 and .25, respectively)
should be removed from an analysis as this is an indication
of very high levels of error. Goodness-of-fit statistic (GFI)
was indicated to be 0.971 (Table 10), which Hooper et al.
(2008) recommended to be higher than 0.90. The adjusted
goodness-of-fit index (AGFI) should also have a value
greater than 0.90, which indicates a well-fitting model
(Hooper et al., 2008).
Convergent Model Analysis
From the LISREL 9.1 analysis of the four latent variables
and their related hypotheses, it was determined that the
model had a good fit with the empirical data. Confirmation
of this was obtained by the consistency of the following mea-
surements and data:
Result details were as follows:
1. Due to the 2 value being equal to 38.64, and the use
of 47 degrees of freedom (df), the ratio between chi-
square and the df was equal to 0.82 when tested,
which showed statistical significance as it was >.05
(p = .802), which confirms the model's hypotheses
are not different from the empirical data.
2. Further confirmation was established as the results of
the GFI equaled 0.979 and the AGFI equaled 0.959.
3. The comparative fit index (CFI) was equal to 1.000.
4. The RMSEA was equal to 0.000.
5. The standardized root mean square residual (SRMR)
was equal to 0.023. As SRMR is an absolute measure
of fit, a value of zero indicates a perfect fit with a
value of <0.08 indicating a reasonable fit (Hu &
Bentler, 1999).
6. Hoelter's "critical N" (CN) was equal to 499.086
(Hoelter, 1983), which is considered to the largest
sample size in which acceptance of the hypothesis for
the model is correct.
All the above further confirm that the model was consis-
tent with the data and had a good fit. Campbell and Fiske
(1959) proposed two constructs to assess the validity of a
test, which were convergent validity and discriminant
validity. In SEM, CFA is usually used to access construct
validity (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 1993). Hair et al. (2016) and
Byrne (2010) indicated that factor loadings or regression
weight estimates of latent to observed variables should
have values greater than 0.50, which indicates that all the

shown to have an indirect, but positive effect on readiness
through gap (H2). Casner-Lotto and Barrington (2006) have
indicated that competency is the ability to use knowledge,
facts, and data to solve workplace problems, as well as being
able to apply math and science concepts to problem solving.
In the research from Rugarcia, Felder, Woods, and Stice
(2000), concerning their vision for engineering education, it
was strongly suggested that the traditional classroom envi-
ronment will probably not be adequate to equip engineering
graduates with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes they will
need in the coming decades, although alternative methods
(e.g., team based and discovery learning) have good pros-
pects to do so.
Need also had a direct and positive influence (0.30) on
gap (H3). This result is supported by a survey of 606 U.S.
organizations (Barrington, Casner-Lotto, & Wright, 2006),
from which seven career readiness competencies were iden-
tified as essential (Table 14). At the top of the list was "pro-
fessionalism/work ethic" with an overwhelming 97.5%,
indicating this was a key element to readiness. In addition,
results were supported by NACE (2015), which indicated
that 80% considered leadership skills as greatest factor in
hiring one candidate over another. NACE's (2015) study
indicating "teamwork" was the most important factor (with a
score of 75%) also supports the research's findings and fur-
ther supports H3.
Need also has a direct and positive influence on readiness
(H4; p < .001) with a positive DE of 0.30. And, once again,
NACE's study supports the hypotheses as career manage-
ment was identified as one of the seven essential prerequi-
sites for career readiness by the 606 survey participants with
a score of 45% (NACE, 2015).
In Thailand, Reeve (2016) indicated in the process for
lifelong learning; technical and vocational education and
training (TVET) must properly prepare their students to live
and work in the 21st century. This was consistent with the
human resource study by Anh (2015) in Vietnam, in which it
was stated that to restructure the economy, a high-quality
workforce is necessary that is trained with high technologies
and/or sciences. Furthermore, as Thailand sets off on its path
toward Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (Iot; Thailand
4.0 in Thailand), a digitally enabled, knowledge worker is
stated to be a pillar to Thailand's economic future and 10 key
economic sectors (Jones & Pimdee, 2017).

Concerning ethics, the study identified numerous times
the stated need for ethics training in engineering education
(ABET; 2015, 2017; Council of Engineers of Thailand,
2010). However, Bairaktarova and Woodcock (2014) have
suggested doing so is not straightforward, and motivating
students to take professional ethics seriously is difficult.
Also, ethics undergraduate curriculum has been found to be
inadequate and ineffective in preparing students to face ethi-
cal issues in their workplace (Colby & Sullivan, 2008;
Lattuca, Terenzini, & Volkwein, 2006; McGinn, 2003;
Shuman et al., 2004). This is especially true in Asia, and was
ranked at the bottom as an engineering need by the engineers
themselves for this study.
Gap has a direct and positive influence on readiness (H5),
which is primarily due to gap's two observed variables,
which included management and teamwork that were found
to be key factors on gap's positive and direct influence on
readiness. This was once again supported by the NACE
(2015) study, in which "teamwork/collaboration" was identi-
fied by 90% of the survey participants as being a key compo-
nent of career readiness (Table 14). Malaysian managers also
ranked as highest (55.7%) the ability to function effectively
as an individual and in a group with the capacity to be a
leader or manager as well as an effective team member as the
most important aspect to graduate readiness (Zaharin, 2009).
This is consistent with research from the World Bank (2014),
in which Vietnamese employers indicated that next to job-
specific technical skills, working well in teams, and being
able to solve problems are considered important behavioral
and cognitive skills for blue-collar workers.
Readiness and its observed variables were verified by
Cheerakarn (2012), who added innovation, leadership, flex-
ibility, motivation, and building relationships as important
components. Torrente's (2014) discussion, concerning
Philippine transnational entrepreneurs, indicated that suc-
cessful personality traits included the need for achievement,
an internal locus of control, and the willingness to take risks.
Conclusion
This study identified some glaring inadequacies related to
Thai engineer readiness in working within other AEC mem-
ber countries on engineering projects. From the results, fol-
low-on study is recommended, which explores the specific
experience of Thai engineers, as well as their ability to meet
the very specific criteria established by the 2005 mutual rec-
ognition arrangement (MRA) on engineering services.
A key item in the MRA is the section in which it states
individual engineers must be in charge of significant engi-
neering work for 2 years (Fukunaga, 2015). Furthermore,
research is needed to establish how much culture (and lan-
guage) plays a role in ASEAN engineering projects, and to
what level Thai engineers have the necessary language skills
to "manage" foreign workers, as it is "managers" that the
ASEAN MRA appears to be actually written for. In addition,
industrial companies in Thailand need to reduce the engi-
neers' competency gap by use of collaborative management
and teamwork so that their competency and needs can be
improved.
