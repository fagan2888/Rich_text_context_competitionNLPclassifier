The concept of "metaemotion" was first introduced by Gottman
et al. (1996) within family therapy research. They claimed that
parents differ with respect to the way they feel and think about
their own and their children's emotions, which in turn affects
the way they approach emotions in everyday life. This organ-
ized set of feelings and thoughts about emotions was referred to
as "metaemotional philosophy." Gottman et al. demonstrated
that various outcome variables in middle childhood (e.g., aca-
demic achievement) were related to the metaemotional philoso-
phy of parents.
Since then, the concept has been adopted and explored fur-
ther by researchers within both philosophy and psychology.
An overview of a philosophical perspective on metaemotion is
provided by Mendonça (2013). Within psychology, metaemo-
tion has been the focus of interest in a variety of different sub-
disciplines, including personality psychology (Mitmansgruber,
Beck, Höfer, & Schüßler, 2009), media psychology (Bartsch,
Appel, & Storch, 2010; Bartsch, Vorderer, Mangold, &
Viehoff, 2008), decision making (Koven, 2011), and clinical
psychology (Shaver, Veilleux, & Ham, 2013), which will be
exemplified next. As will be illustrated in what follows, there
is to date no consensus across psychological disciplines with
regard to how metaemotion is defined, beyond the general
agreement that metaemotions involve "emotions about emo-
tions."
Gottman et al. (1996) pointed to the parallel between metae-
motion, "emotion about emotion," and metacognition, "cogni-
tion about cognition," in that they are involved in the executive
control of emotion and cognition, respectively. However, few
attempts have been made to explicitly draw parallels between
the two research areas. Our aim is to show how distinctions
made within metacognition research may be usefully applied to
metaemotion research, in order to clarify the concept of metae-
motion further. A larger consensus on how metaemotion could
be defined and what components it may consist of would make
it easier to compare and combine findings across different stud-
ies, and may provide a starting point for developing a broader
theoretical model of metaemotion. In addition, a clarification of
the concept of metaemotion may broaden the potential range of
measures by which it can be assessed.
It should be noted that metaemotion is closely related to
"meta-mood" (Mayer & Gaschke, 1988). While metaemotion
refers to "emotions about emotions," "meta-mood" has been
defined as a reflective process that accompanies mood states,
more specifically, an "ongoing process associated with moods
whereby individuals continually reflect upon their feelings,

to Learn From Research on Metacognition?

Abstract
We first present a selection of vignette examples from empirical psychological research to illustrate how the phenomenon of
metaemotion (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1996; Mendonça, 2013) is studied within different domains of psychology. We then
present a theoretical distinction which has been made between three facets of metacognition, namely metacognitive experiences,
metacognitive knowledge, and metacognitive strategies (e.g., Efklides, 2008; Flavell, 1979). Referring back to the vignette examples
from metaemotion research, we argue that a similar distinction can be drawn between three facets of metaemotion, namely
metaemotional experiences, metaemotional knowledge, and metaemotional strategies. We argue that this distinction clarifies some
of the unresolved issues in metaemotion research, and therefore has important implications for the study of metaemotion, both
methodologically and theoretically.

monitoring, evaluating, and regulating them" (Salovey, Mayer,
Goldman, Turvey, & Palfai, 1995, p. 127). At face value, the
main difference between meta-mood and metaemotion is
whether the primary event is a mood or an emotion, that is, the
state's duration, strength, antecedent event, and behavioural/
physiological correlates. However, the difference between
meta-mood and metaemotion as it is treated in the literature is
not always clear. For example some self-report items used to
assess meta-mood are in fact concerned with emotions (e.g.,
the Trait Meta-Mood Scale item "I never give in to my emo-
tions"; Salovey et al., 1995). Thus many of the points raised in
this article would therefore also apply to research on meta-
mood. Nevertheless, the differences between meta-mood and
metaemotion should be discussed and studied further in the
future.
Some Central Properties of Metaemotion
In a review of some central psychological and philosophical
articles on metaemotion, Mendonça (2013) points to a central
property of metaemotion that qualifies it as a separate and dis-
tinguishable concept within emotion theory. This property is
reflexivitiy, that is, that the experience of a metaemotion may
have an impact on the first-order emotion, which may in turn
change the meaning of the emotional experience itself. One
example is when a "blush of embarrassment may be intensified
by embarrassment over the blush" (Feagin, 1983, p. 97).
Importantly, Mendonça points out that when parents and teach-
ers educate children about emotions this will necessarily have to
occur through reflections about metaemotion. Mendonça also
addresses some unresolved questions in metaemotion research,
for instance whether there are limits to the number of layers of
metaemotion (e.g., is it meaningful to talk about an emotion
about an emotion about an emotion?), the extent to which the
phenomenology of emotion and metaemotion can be under-
stood separately, whether certain types of emotion can only
occur at a certain level, and whether metaemotions are generally
veridical.
Mendonça (2013), who represents a philosophical tradition,
points to the need for more research on metaemotion, including
a more precise clarification of the concept and how it relates to
neighbouring phenomena. In the following, we first present a
small selection of empirical research on metaemotion taken
from different psychological subdisciplines. The aim is to
exemplify how metaemotion has been defined and measured
within different studies, and to show how metaemotion has been
found to predict various outcome variables. Moreover, this sec-
tion is intended to show that the clarifications requested by
Mendonça are also clearly needed within empirical psychologi-
cal research on metaemotion. We then turn to a different psy-
chological research area, namely metacognition research. Our
intention is to show how theoretical distinctions drawn within
this area can be transferred to metaemotion research in order to
more precisely clarify the concept. In our opinion, this would be
useful both from a theoretical and from an applied empirical
standpoint.
Studies and Definitions of Metaemotion:
Some Examples
Mitmansgruber et al. (2009) broadly define metaemotion as
emotional reactions about one's "emotional self." They claim
that metaemotion has a regulatory function, and that its phe-
nomenological quality (e.g., anxiety, anger, compassion)
reflects qualities of self-regulation, for example, its associated
motivation and action tendency. In a nonclinical sample they
found that individual differences in metaemotion predicted sub-
jective well-being over and above the related variables trait
mindfulness and experiential avoidance. In this study, metae-
motion was measured with the Meta-Emotion Scale, a self-
report questionnaire assessing six components of metaemotion
(anger, compassionate care, interest, contempt/shame, thought
control, and suppression).
According to Bartsch et al. (2010), metaemotions are emo-
tions that have other emotions as their appraisal object. They are
related to "concerns beyond the scope of the primary emotion"
and involve "affective reactions toward the primary emotion,
and motivation to change the expected course of the primary
emotion" (Bartsch et al., 2008, p. 16). In a field study among
moviegoers who watched drama or horror films (Bartsch et al.,
2010), stable individual differences in metaemotion, which
could be referred to as "trait" metaemotion, were measured by
the Need For Affect Scale (Maio & Esses, 2001). This scale
consists of two dimensions, namely the tendency to approach
versus avoid emotions. Primary emotions elicited by the mov-
ies, and emotions about current primary emotions, which could
be referred to as "state" metaemotions, were both assessed with
self-report questionnaires. Two factors in state metaemotion
were identified--metaemotion enjoyment (e.g., "I like this feel-
ing") and metaemotion normative appreciation (e.g., "I find
these feelings embarrassing"). Need for affect scores predicted
the intensity, valence, and ambivalence of primary emotions,
and differences in state metaemotions: high need for affect
avoidance predicted lower metaemotion enjoyment and norma-
tive appreciation, whereas higher need for affect approach pre-
dicted a higher tendency to view one's emotions as normatively
adequate. The only effect of movie type (drama vs. horror) was
that drama movies were associated with more negative emotion.
Koven's (2011) study is concerned with utilitarian reason-
ing, that is, "in which action for the good of many is tantamount
even at the expense of the good of one." The hypothesis is that
the tendency to make utilitarian decisions, assumed to require
cognitive control of emotion, is related to individual differences
in metaemotion. Metaemotion is here regarded as a set of strate-
gies relevant for using emotional information adaptively,
including "the ability to pay attention to emotions, discriminate
among emotions, verbally label emotions, and regulate emo-
tions" (Koven, 2011, p. 1256). Utilitarian decision making was
assessed by presentation of "high-conflict" personal moral
dilemmas concerning "whether it is appropriate to harm one
individual in order to save the lives of several individuals" (p.
1256). Individual differences in metaemotion were measured by
the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (Taylor, Bagby, & Parker, 1997),
Norman & Furnes Metaemotion 189
the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (Salovey et al., 1995), and the Mood
Awareness Scale (Swinkles & Giuliano, 1995).Afactor analysis
identified that questionnaire items could be grouped into two
factors--clarity of emotion and attention to emotion. Utilitarian
decision making was negatively related to clarity of emotion,
indicating that high clarity of emotion may imply longer lasting
emotional reactions to negative stimuli (e.g., "high-conflict"
moral dilemmas), which may impair cognitive control.
Shaver et al. (2013) hypothesize that differences in metae-
motion may partly explain individual differences in the ten-
dency to "drink to cope." Metaemotion is seen as a form of
emotion where the appraisal object is "any of the several com-
ponents that comprise a given primary emotional reaction"
(Shaver et al., 2013, p. 1020), that is, may potentially occur in
response to an emotion's physiological changes, expressive
actions, behavioural urges, or subjective feelings. They stud-
ied two forms of metaemotion, (a) anxiety sensitivity, that is,
being anxious about physiological and expressive components
of anxiety, measured by the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (Taylor
et al., 2007), and (b) nonacceptance, that is, difficulty in
accepting one's negative emotions, measured by the Non-
Acceptance subscale of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation
Scale (Gratz & Roemer, 2004). Drinking to cope was predicted
by trait negative affect and trait anxiety, but not by the two
forms of metaemotion. However, they were both associated
with trait anxiety, and nonacceptance was associated with
increased negative affect.
These examples illustrate that metaemotion is considered a
predictor of various indices of well-being and mental health.
They also show that different subdisciplines of psychology
share the same basic understanding of the phenomenon. The
general view that metaemotion is an emotion that has other
emotional phenomena as an appraisal object is explicitly stated
by Mitmansgruber et al. (2009), Bartsch et al., (2010), and
Shaver et al. (2013), and is also implied in Koven (2011).
However they also illustrate inconsistencies in the way metae-
motion is specifically operationalized across studies: For
instance, one question is whether metaemotion should be seen
as an emotion in its proper sense--that is, a multifaceted phe-
nomenon with cognitive, phenomenological, motivational,
physiological, and behavioural correlates, or as a self-regulation
mechanism. Furthermore, if metaemotions differ from emotions
in terms of their appraisal object, is the appraisal object an emo-
tion per se (as Bartsch et al. [2010] seem to indicate), or could
any individual component of an emotion constitute such an
appraisal object (as Shaver et al. [2013] suggests)? It is also
unclear whether and to what extent various suggested subcom-
ponents of metaemotion overlap, for example, attention to emo-
tion (Koven, 2011) versus interest (Mitmansgruber et al., 2009),
and contempt/shame (Mitmansgruber et al., 2009) versus non-
acceptance (Shaver et al., 2013).
Metacognition and Its Facets
Even though Gottman et al. (1996) explicitly compared metae-
motion to metacognition, a systematic comparison of the two
concepts seems still to be lacking. Metacognition broadly refers
to "cognition about one's own cognition," and is assumed to be
involved in monitoring and control of ongoing cognition
(Nelson & Narens, 1990). Metacognition can be operationalized
and measured in a number of different ways (see Tarricone,
2011, for a comprehensive overview). The following discussion
will be based on a broad and widely acknowledged distinction
between three facets of metacognition.
The distinction between metacognitive experience, metacog-
nitive knowledge, and metacognitive strategies originates from
Flavell (1979). He defined metacognitive experiences as "any
conscious cognitive or affective experiences that accompany and
pertain to any intellectual enterprise" (Flavell, 1979, p. 906).
Importantly, they are experienced (and often reported) during a
cognitive activity, for example, "feelings-of-knowing" in mem-
ory situations. Metacognitive experiences can be subdivided into
information-based metacognitive judgements and experience-
based metacognitive feelings (Koriat, 2007; Norman, Price, &
Duff, 2010), depending on whether the experience occurs in rela-
tion to explicit/conscious or implicit/unconscious cognitive
activity. Metacognitive knowledge is "that segment of your ...
stored world knowledge that has to do with people as cognitive
creatures and with their diverse cognitive tasks, goals, actions,
and experiences" (Flavell, 1979, p. 906). It includes declarative
beliefs about one's own cognitive processes and the factors that
influence specific cognitive processes and their outcome, for
example, knowledge about the effect of rehearsal on memory.
Metacognitive knowledge can be further subdivided according
to whether the knowledge concerns oneself, others, task-specific
knowledge, or one's possession of cognitive strategies (Dunlosky
& Metcalfe, 2009; Efklides, 2008; Flavell, 1979). It should be
noted that Flavell (1979) pointed to the potential overlap between
metacognitive knowledge and experience, in that "Some experi-
ences have such knowledge as their content and some do not;
some knowledge may become conscious and comprise such
experiences and some may never do so" (Flavell, 1979, p. 908).
Metacognitive strategies are strategies that the individual
engages in with the aim of controlling cognitive processes--the
"deliberate use of strategies (i.e., procedural knowledge) in order
to control cognition" (Efklides, 2008, p. 280). Flavell (1979)
used the term actions/strategies to refer to this form of metacog-
nition. Even though he classified it as a separate metacognitive
entity, he emphasized that it differed from knowledge/experience
only in content and function, not in form or quality, and therefore
could also be seen as a variety of metacognitive knowledge. It
should be noted that Flavell (1979) also included "metacognitive
goals/tasks" as a fourth form of metacognition. However, since
this is not commonly acknowledged as a separate metacognitive
facet (see, e.g., Efklides, 2008), and because it is less applicable
to the area of metaemotion, we have not included this possible
facet in our discussion.
Three Facets of Metaemotion?
As an attempt to clarify and attune a more precise definition of
metaemotion, we propose that the metaemotion phenomenon as
190 Emotion Review Vol. 8 No. 2
a general construct can be understood in terms of the interplay
between three different classes of phenomena that correspond to
three facets of metacognition presented before. It should be
noted that although an in-depth understanding of metaemotion
requires that all three proposed facets are taken into account,
individual facets can in principle be targeted separately.
Metaemotional Experiences
Metaemotion is often described as a "meta-level" experience in
ongoing emotional experience, with its phenomenological
qualities being as differentiated as those of primary emotional
experience. As pointed out by Shaver et al. (2013), the phenom-
enology of metaemotions may include feelings of anger, sad-
ness, embarrassment, shame, anxiety, etc. The "raw feel", or
subjective component of metaemotions, not necessarily acces-
sible to conscious introspection or control, may be seen as cor-
responding to metacognitive experiences and be labelled
metaemotional experiences. The concepts of metaemotion
enjoyment (e.g., "I like this feeling") and metaemotion norma-
tive appreciation (e.g., "I find these feelings embarrassing";
Bartsch et al., 2010) seem to reflect this aspect of metaemotion.
The Anxiety Sensitivity Index used by Shaver et al. (2013) also
seems to address the subjective reaction associated with the
experience of anxiety, for example, whether one feels scared,
embarrassed, or worried. Moreover, the Non-Acceptance sub-
scale of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (Shaver
et al., 2013) contains items that primarily seem to reflect metae-
motional experiences (e.g., "I experience my emotions as over-
whelming and out of control").
Even though we describe metaemotional experiences as
emotional by nature, they may sometimes be accompanied by
cognitive experiences. For example, a father who gets angry
with his child may metaemotionally feel sad that he reacted in
this way. In addition, he may also reflect upon why he reacted
with anger in this particular situation. This situation cannot
purely be understood as a case of "emotion about emotion"
but also as "cognition about emotion," thus the distinction
between metaemotional and cognitive experience is not
always clear-cut.1
Metaemotional Knowledge
Gottman et al. (1996) distinguished between parents'"metaemo-
tion philosophy" and their actual way of approaching their own
and their children's emotions.An organized set of thoughts about
emotions seems parallel to metacognitive knowledge, which
refers to people's declarative knowledge about cognitive pro-
cesses. One suggestion would therefore be to categorize this
form of metaemotion as metaemotional knowledge. Declarative
metacognitive knowledge can further be subdivided into differ-
ent knowledge areas, for example, between knowledge of self
and others, and knowledge of task and context (Tarricone, 2011).
The latter could for instance refer to knowledge of human mem-
ory and the situational and behavioural factors that may influ-
ence a person's memory. A similar subdivision of declarative
metaemotional knowledge could be made between knowledge of
one's own and others' emotions, general knowledge about emo-
tions, knowledge about specific emotions, and knowledge about
situational and behavioural factors that may influence a person's
emotions.
Some of the items in the self-report scales referred to earlier
concern the individual's degree of insight/knowledge into their
own patterns of emotional reactions, their tendency to regard
emotions as useful information source, and to label and make
use of this information. In other words, they all reflect various
forms of metaemotional knowledge. Such items include those
of Mitmansgruber et al.'s (2009) subscales that concern peo-
ple's tendency to react with anger to their emotions (e.g., "I
repeatedly get angry about my emotional reactions"), The Non-
Acceptance subscale of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation
Scale (e.g., "When I'm upset, I acknowledge my emotions")
used by Shaver et al. (2013), and items that load on Koven's
(2011) factors attention to emotion and clarity of emotion (e.g.,
the Toronto Alexithymia Scale item "I find examinations of my
feelings useful in solving personal problems"). When Mendonça
(2013) claims that metaemotions are influenced by the person's
values and beliefs, this can also be understood as a case of
metaemotional knowledge. Furthermore, Mendonça (2013)
provides a series of examples of situations where teachers and
parents communicate knowledge about patterns of emotional
experiences to children. For example, they may teach and give
children feedback about the duration and progression of emo-
tions, and which emotions are appropriate or normal in a given
situation. Mendonça's examples concerning the education of
emotion all seem to reflect different subtypes of metaemotional
knowledge.
Metaemotional Strategies
Several authors address the control/regulatory function of
metaemotions. According to Bartsch et al. (2008), metaemotion
may play a role in those forms of emotional self-regulation that
attempt to change the emotion itself. In discussing metaemotion
and reflexivity, Mendonça (2013) also addresses the regulatory
aspect of metaemotions. This aspect of metaemotions can be
seen as parallel to the concept of metacognitive strategies, and
could be labelled metaemotional strategies. The Meta-Emotion
Scale's (Mitmansgruber et al., 2009) subscales thought control
(e.g., "I repeatedly force myself to pull myself together") and
suppression (e.g., "I cannot come to grips with strong emo-
tions"), and the Trait Meta-Mood Scale Mood Repair subscale
all concern the ability to regulate one's emotions. Similarly,
some Toronto Alexithymia Scale items, like "I am able to
describe my feelings easily" also seem to reflect this form of
metaemotion. It could also be argued that some of the scales and
items reflecting the ability to make use of emotional informa-
tion, categorized before under metaemotional knowledge, are
concerned with the person's metacognitive insight into a metae-
motional strategy. This illustrates that metaemotional knowl-
edge and strategies are closely related, as is also the case for
metacognitive knowledge and strategies (Flavell, 1979).
Norman & Furnes Metaemotion 191
In some cases, metaemotional self-regulation involves the
regulation of ongoing emotions. For example, if a sudden strike
of anxiety triggers negative metaemotional experiences (e.g.,
being anxious of one's ongoing anxiety), one may attempt to
alleviate the primary emotion by distracting oneself from the
object or situation that triggered it, or by mechanisms like reap-
praisal or suppression. Here, metaemotional strategies involve
the application of strategies for the control of current emotion.
However metaemotional self-regulation may sometimes occur
at a more superordinate level. First, they may relate to the pre-
diction and control of future emotions (e.g., being anxious about
one's future anxiety). Second, they may involve identification
of current emotions, monitoring of changes in one's emotional
state, planning of strategies to be applied later, regulating one's
emotions in case they deviate from predicted emotions, and
evaluating the outcome of emotional regulation attempts.2
The Relationship Between the Three Proposed
Facets of Metaemotion
Although we propose that the three facets of metaemotion can
be theoretically distinguished and operationalized indepen-
dently of one another, it is also important to keep in mind that
they are, to some extent, mutually dependent. For instance,
Mitmansgruber et al. (2009) argue that the quality of metaemo-
tion provides information about regulatory processes operating
on the target emotion--for example, being angry about one's
anxiety may influence the experience of the primary anxiety and
lead to attempts to alleviate it. This is different from experienc-
ing compassion about anxiety. Here metaemotional experiences
(of, e.g., anxiety or compassion) seem to influence the applica-
tion of metaemotional strategies (e.g., attempting to alleviate
anxiety). In addition, both the phenomenal quality of the metae-
motion and which regulatory metaemotional strategies are initi-
ated, may be influenced by metacognitive knowledge of, for
example, whether it would be appropriate/normal to experience
and express anxiety in the given situation. Mendonça (2013)
also presents an interesting example where awareness of metae-
motion can reduce interpersonal conflict by helping people to
shift perspective and take on a more collaborative attitude. This
could be seen as a case where introspection on metaemotional
experience may generalize or transform to metaemotional
knowledge, which in turn influences the person's metaemo-
tional strategies.
The relationship between these three facets can also be illus-
trated by an example from research on affective forecasting, that
is, prediction of future emotional states (Wilson & Gilbert,
2003). Affective forecasting per se could be regarded as the
application of metaemotional knowledge, that is, assumptions
or knowledge about one's own and others' emotional reactions.
However, it has also been shown that the impact bias in affec-
tive forecasting is influenced by individual differences in a trait
mindfulness facet concerned with the ability to observe one's
emotion (Emanuel, Updegraff, Kalmbach, & Ciesla, 2010).
This could be seen as a metaemotional strategy that concerns
the ability to accurately identify metaemotional experiences.
Metaemotion: Trait or State?
In the previous presentation of metaemotional experience,
knowledge, and strategies we have not directly specified
whether we regard each of these as state or trait variables. For
example, the metaemotional experience of being angry at one's
anxiety may be seen as a state variable in the sense that it refers
to a short-lived psychological state that has a specific precur-
sor. However, the tendency to react to one's anxiety with anger
may be influenced by more stable individual differences. Thus,
metaemotional experiences cannot straightforwardly be classi-
fied as either a state or trait variable, and may best be seen as a
combination of both. The same applies to metaemotional strat-
egies and metaemotional knowledge, where "trait" refers to the
potential availability of certain metaemotional strategies or
knowledge, and "state" refers to whether or not a potentially
available strategy or potentially available metaemotional
knowledge, respectively, is applied in a given situation. For
example, the metaemotional self-control strategy reflected on
items like "I repeatedly force myself to pull myself together"
may be seen as a trait variable because it refers to a relatively
stable self-regulatory mechanism. However, although in pos-
session of such strategies, one can imagine cases where people
are not able to activate/use them due to the context surrounding
a given situation, see the work of Baumeister and colleagues on
self-control depletion (Baumeister, Vohs, & Tice, 2007;
Muraven & Baumeister, 2000).
Metaemotion Versus Emotional Intelligence
This view of metaemotion as involving both state and trait prop-
erties makes it different from the related concept of emotional
intelligence, which has been measured using some of the same
self-report scales, and which has also been divided into subcom-
ponents that have some resemblance with the suggested facets
of metaemotion. For instance, the Trait Meta-Mood Scale
(Salovey et al., 1995) and the TorontoAlexithymia Scale (Taylor
et al., 1997), have been used to measure both metaemotion and
emotional intelligence, and the emotional intelligence branch
"Managing emotions so as to attain specific goals" (Mayer,
Salovey, & Caruso, 2008) has some similarity to the concept of
metaemotional strategies as defined in the previous lines. Thus,
in spite of the apparent overlap the most important difference
between the two concepts is that whereas emotional intelligence
refers to a person's relatively stable characteristics, whether
defined in terms of "trait" or "ability" (see Mayer et al., 2008),
each component of metaemotion may be seen as involving an
interplay between trait and state (cf. previous discussion).
Implications for the Study and Measurement
of Metaemotion
The most obvious implication of our multifaceted view is that
researchers should explicitly specify which facet of metaemo-
tion is being studied. This makes it possible to more directly
compare findings across different studies, and to build broader
192 Emotion Review Vol. 8 No. 2
models for how to understand the phenomenon of metaemotion.
In addition, there are a number of methodological and theoreti-
cal implications. We now address a few of these.
In the aforementioned studies, all three potential facets of
metaemotion, including metaemotional experiences, were
measured by self-report questionnaires. This also typically
applies to the three facets of metacognition. However, a differ-
ence between the two research areas concerns the measurement
of the primary emotional/cognitive event. In metaemotion
research, measures of the primary emotion are not always
included (but see Bartsch et al., 2010). In contrast, metacogni-
tive experiences are normally measured in direct conjunction
with the cognitive event to which they relate, and performance
on the cognitive task is also measured. Examples include "feel-
ings-of-knowing" (Koriat, 2007), "judgements of learning"
(Koriat, 2007), and "confidence ratings" (Norman & Price, in
press). Very few methods have been developed for studying
metaemotional experience in direct conjunction with the pri-
mary emotional experience. Future research should aim to
develop such methods. However it should be noted that the con-
cept of metaemotional experiences may be broader than that of
metacognitive experiences since emotion involves physiologi-
cal and behavioural response patterns in addition to subjective
feelings. The potential range of measures to assess metaemo-
tional experiences may therefore include any technique used to
assess emotion, including various psychophysiological tech-
niques to measure the behavioural correlates of emotions, for
example, measurement of skin conductance responses, heart
rate, blood pressure, cortisol level, electromyography, and res-
piration rate (Fox, 2008). In addition, Mendonça (2013) points
to some properties of metaemotional experience that may have
implications for its measurement. First, it is an open question
whether emotions are always accompanied by metaemotion,
that is, it may not be meaningful to measure metaemotion in
conjunction with all forms of emotional experiences because
the emotion does not always elicit a metaemotional response.
For example, the extent to which anger is accompanied by
metaemotion (e.g., anxiety) would depend on a variety of indi-
vidual and situational factors. One may even hypothesize that
asking people to report their metaemotional experiences may
even trigger metaemotions in cases where these would other-
wise be absent. Second, it is likely that metaemotions are some-
times experienced separately from the primary emotion,
whereas in other cases the two are intertwined. An example pro-
vided by Mendonça (2013) is a person who experiences sadness
about feeling jealous, either immediately upon the experience of
jealousy, or "after the strike of jealousy has phenomenologically
disappeared" (p. 390). This has consequences for the extent to
which metaemotion can be measured independently from the
primary emotion. Third, there may be variation in the degree of
similarity between the primary emotion and the metaemotion,
which may also influence the distinguishability of the two. For
instance, a case of "sadness about sadness" is more difficult to
measure than a case of "anxiety about sadness," especially if the
two co-occur. The development of techniques to measure metae-
motional experiences separately from the primary emotion to
which they relate should focus on cases in which the metaemo-
tion is both phenomenologically different and temporarily
removed from the primary emotion in question.
Throughout the article we have highlighted the close rela-
tionship between metaemotional knowledge and metaemo-
tional strategies. The relatedness of the two phenomena has to
do with the fact that the application of a strategy will always
require and be influenced by relevant knowledge. However
there is also a methodological reason why it can sometimes be
challenging to differentiate between the two: Self-report meas-
ures of strategies will by definition reflect no more than the
person's knowledge of their strategies. To the extent that
metaemotional strategies involve implicit, procedural knowl-
edge, this will not necessarily correspond to the person's ver-
balizable strategies. Mendonça's (2013) claims that people
may be even less conscious of their metaemotions than their
emotions, which adds to the importance of this argument.
Future research should aim to develop methods for measuring
metaemotional strategies more directly, for instance by apply-
ing methodological principles from research on implicit cogni-
tion, where dissociation between behavioural performance
measures and verbal report is taken to indicate, for instance,
that an attitude is implicit (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz,
1998) or that learning is acquired independently of conscious
awareness (Cleeremans & French, 2002).
A related implication concerns the debated question of
whether or not definitions of metaemotion should include
thoughts about emotions. As pointed out by Eisenberg (1996),
metaemotion may influence behaviour in ways other than those
captured by the person's explicit beliefs, and the inclusion of a
cognitive component of metaemotion may therefore seem con-
tradictory. The broader, multifaceted view of metaemotion sug-
gested here opens for the possibility that explicit metaemotional
knowledge may sometimes dissociate from the more implicit,
automatic properties of metaemotion which are more likely to
be reflected in metaemotional experiences and strategies.
Concluding Remarks
In this article we have proposed a framework for understanding
the phenomenon of metaemotion that builds on a frequently used
distinction in metacognition research, namely the distinction
between metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive strategies,
and metacognitive experiences. We suggest that metaemotion
can be subcategorized into metaemotional knowledge, metae-
motional strategies, and metaemotional experiences. This
attempt to integrate knowledge from metacognition research into
research on metaemotion is inspired by Gottman et al. (1996),
who pointed to the two fields as being analogous. It constitutes
an attempt to move towards a more precise clarification of the
concept of metaemotion, which has been identified by Mendonça
(2013) as an area of priority for future research. In our view, the
subdivision into three categories of metaemotion can be a useful
tool for understanding and interpreting existing research findings.
Importantly, it can also be seen as a framework that can
guide future research. More specifically, it may allow for the

formulation of more targeted research questions, as well as the
development of more precise measurement methods, for instance
methods that assess metaemotional experience in direct conjunc-
tion with the primary emotional experience.
