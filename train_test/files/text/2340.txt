Despite substantial attention toward environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure, previous studies have not provided adequate information to apply
broadly within community-scale risk assessments. We aim to estimate residential concentrations of particulate matter (PM) from ETS in
sociodemographic and geographic subpopulations in the United States for the purpose of screening-level risk assessment. We developed regression
models to characterize smoking using the 2006­7 Current Population SurveyFTobacco Use Supplement, and linked these with air exchange models
using the 2007 American Housing Survey. Using repeated logistic and log-linear models (n ¼ 1000), we investigated whether household variables from the
2000 United States census can predict exposure likelihood and ETS-PM concentration in exposed households. We estimated a mean ETS-PM
concentration of 16 mg/m3 among the 17% of homes with non-zero exposure (3 mg/m3 overall), with substantial variability among homes. The highest
exposure likelihood was in the South and Midwest regions, rural populations, and low-income households. Concentrations in exposed households were
highest in the South and demonstrated a non-monotonic association with income, related to air exchange rate patterns. We provide estimates of ETS-PM
concentration distributions for different subpopulations in the United States, providing a starting point for communities interested in characterizing
aggregate and cumulative risks from indoor pollutants.

Introduction
Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) is an indoor air
pollutant of great interest and concern for agencies including
the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), among
others (USEPA, 1992). The CDC in its 2006 Surgeon
General's report estimated 24,300­69,600 excess cardiovas-
cular deaths annually and 3,423­8,866 excess lung cancer
deaths attributable to ETS nationwide (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2006). In its risk assessment and
subsequent analyses, the California EPA estimated that health
effects in children nationwide include over 200,000 episodes
of childhood asthma per year (new cases and exacerbations);
and 150,000­300,000 cases of lower respiratory illness, among
other adverse effects (California EPA, 1997).
Although these studies clearly indicate that the public
health burden of ETS exposure is substantial, the health risk
assessments have multiple limitations. These national risk
estimates use a crude surrogate of ETS exposure, based on
survey data indicating whether or not individuals live with
smokers. This exposure metric was chosen to correspond
with the epidemiological studies applied in these national risk
assessments, as quantitative measurements of ETS concen-
trations and exposure have not been available for all
participants in these studies (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2006). Such an approach does provide
reasonable estimates of national-scale health risks, albeit with
some uncertainties, but the reliability of this surrogate
measure may vary across demographic subpopulations, and
the approach lacks sufficient resolution to identify potentially
meaningful community differences in exposure. The smoking
literature shows significant sociodemographic and geographic
variation of smoking prevalence and intensity (Shavers et al.,
2005; Shavers et al., 2006; Datta et al., 2006; Osypuk et al.,
2006); furthermore, housing characteristics such as home
volume and air exchange rate significantly influence exposure
implications of smoking (Klepeis and Nazaroff, 2006).
Demographic factors correlated with smoking may also be

correlated with housing characteristics, influencing ETS
concentration patterns and potentially increasing variability
within and between communities.
There is a growing interest in quantifying ETS exposure at
the community level because of its ubiquity in indoor
environments and its association with multiple health outcomes
as described above. ETS is cited as an environmental issue of
concern within the context of community-based cumulative
assessment of indoor pollutants such as particulate matter (PM)
associated with asthma (Zartarian and Schultz, 2010). How-
ever, national-scale analyses lack sufficient resolution for the
above-mentioned reasons and rarely are local data available on
ETS exposure (USEPA, 1992).
Previous studies provide insight about ETS concentrations
in indoor microenvironments and biomarkers of ETS
exposures, but none have generated the data needed to
characterize exposure systematically at a community level
across the United States. Studies conducted before the
introduction of smoking restrictions in public venues directly
measured concentrations of ETS-PM using personal moni-
tors, but the evidence from these studies cannot be used
directly to construct exposure models in residential settings
(Repace, 2004; Repace et al., 2006; Jenkins et al., 1996;
Jenkins et al., 2001). Given increasing smoking restrictions in
public places, the majority of the exposure and risk burden
may shift to the residential environment, but no study to date
has developed broad-based and generalizable models of ETS
exposure inside homes. Previous residential studies have
either characterized ETS contributions to residential expo-
sures within hypothetical simulation models or using
measurements but without a nationally generalizable model
framework (Dockery and Spengler, 1981; Leaderer, 1990;
Ozkaynak et al., 1996; Klepeis and Nazaroff, 2006; Myatt
et al., 2008). It is therefore unknown how variability in
smoking patterns correlates with housing characteristics that
influence indoor concentrations of ETS, necessary in
determining variability in residential concentrations and risk.
Studies using cotinine as a biomarker of exposure among
children have demonstrated significant associations with
parental education, race/ethnicity, income, and home size,
but did not yield models directly applicable to all locations at
fine geographic resolution and had challenges in separating
predictors of exposure from factors that could influence
metabolism (Mannino et al., 2001; Max et al., 2009; Marano
et al., 2009).
We aim to develop a model that can be used to
systematically estimate residential ETS concentrations in
demographic and geographic subpopulations using publicly
available data across the United States for the purpose of
screening-level cumulative or comparative risk assessment.
We develop and apply regression models based on national
data sets to estimate residential cigarette smoking and air
exchange rate patterns in order to characterize the distribu-
tion of PM concentrations from ETS in United States
homes. We investigate whether household demographic and
geographic variables that are widely available at fine
geographic resolution can be used to predict (1) the
likelihood of residential exposure to ETS-PM and (2)
concentration levels of ETS-PM in exposed households.
Methods
Study Population
The study population for the ETS model consisted of 98,329
individuals residing in 39,107 homes for which occupant
interviews were conducted in the 2007 National American
Housing Survey (AHS) (US Department of Housing and
Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and
Research, 2009). The AHS is a nationally representative
survey of the housing stock in the United States. Information
collected during the survey included occupants' demographic
characteristics, which we used to model the likelihood of
smoking; and housing characteristics, which we used to

4. Estimate ETS-PM emissions per person by combining binary home-smoking status with predicted daily cigarettes, emission rates per cigarette, and time
spent at home.
5. Apply previously developed air exchange model to estimate air changes per hour for each AHS home using floor area, year built, and unit type.
6. Sum ETS-PM emissions across each household and apply one-compartment mass balance model to obtain screening-level estimates of equilibrium
ETS-PM concentrations in each AHS home, assuming perfect mixing.
7. Apply statistical analysis to describe association of ETS-PM concentrations in the home with demographic and geographic household covariates,
constraining covariates to publicly available census-tract cross-tabulations (United States Census 2000) to allow for broad-based extrapolation.

the steps conducted to estimate and model variability in ETS
concentrations. Table 1b provides a summary of parameters
and assumptions used to calculate the estimated ETS-PM
emissions and equilibrium concentrations. Both the model
steps and parametric assumptions are described in more
detail below. Unless otherwise stated, all steps were
conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute).
CPS-TUS Smoking Models
Two smoking models were developed for this study, using
data from the 2006­7 Current Population SurveyFTobacco
Use Supplement (CPS-TUS) (US Department of Commerce,
Census Bureau, 2008), n ¼ 227, 428. These data have previ-
ously been used within multilevel logistic regressions to
predict the probability of smoking based on individual
characteristics (age, sex, poverty, race/ethnicity, nativity,
education, occupation, employment, marital status, and
number of people in the household) and area characteristics
(state smoking laws, state taxes, percent poverty of core-
based statistical area); more details about the underlying
statistical approach are described elsewhere (Chahine, 2010).
For the purpose of our analyses, we needed to make
multiple modifications to the previous modeling framework
(Chahine, 2010), given the focus in this analysis on
residential exposures as well as constraints in available data
within other steps of the modeling (Table 1a). In our first
model (model 1a), we used as our outcome variable smoking
at home rather than smoking overall. The TUS asked
respondents whether smoking is prohibited inside the home,
permitted in some places or at some time inside the home,
or permitted everywhere inside the home. Subjects who
replied that smoking is prohibited inside the home were
assigned a value of 0 for the outcome; all other subjects were
assigned a value of 1. As no further detail was provided in the
survey, for the purpose of this analysis we did not
differentiate between subjects who were permitted to smoke
in some places or at some time inside the home vs everywhere
inside the home.
In our second model, we used TUS data on number of
cigarettes smoked daily for home smokers, which was
predicted using linear regression (model 1b). Occupation
and employment, which were statistically significant pre-
dictors previously (Chahine, 2010), were not included
because insufficient information was provided on these
covariates in the AHS data set. Random effects at the state
and core-based statistical area level were also not included,
due to insufficient geographic identifiers in the AHS data set.
We used a household random parameter to account for the
nested structure of the AHS data. Dummy variables were
added to represent census region and metropolitan status
(central city vs suburb). Models 1a and 1b were created using
MLwiN 2.16 (Rasbash et al., 2002).
A total of 24% of the TUS study population did not
complete the portion of the survey dedicated to rules of
smoking at home and work. These subjects were either
unemployed, self-employed, or retired. Summary statistics
were performed to determine whether this sub-population
differed from the general population in demographics and
smoking prevalence. A further 1% of the TUS study
population did not know or refused to answer this portion
of the questionnaire. Therefore the total sample size for
model 1a was 169,061. Only home smokers were included in
the analysis for model 1b (n ¼ 18,529), and an additional 164
people were excluded due to missing values for number of
cigarettes, resulting in a sample size of 18,265 for model 1b.
AHS Smoking Predictions
As described above, we used model 1a to calculate the
predicted probability of home smoking for each individual in
the AHS, according to their sociodemographic characteristics
(age, sex, poverty, race/ethnicity, nativity, education, marital
status, and number of people in the household) and
geographic covariates (census region and urban status). The
predicted probability was then used to assign a binary home-
smoking status for each individual, to appropriately capture
the fact that each household either does or does not have a
smoker. This was done by generating a random number

between 0 and 1 and determining whether this number was
less than the individual's predicted probability of home
smoking (resulting in an assignment of a home-smoking
status of 1) or greater than the predicted probability of home
smoking (resulting in an assignment of a home-smoking
status of 0). The resulting simulated data set of home
smokers vs non-home smokers was then carried forward in
the subsequent analyses described below. This process was
repeated 1000 times to construct 1000 simulated data sets.
All individuals under the age of 18 were assigned a home-
smoking status of zero because the underlying TUS data on
which the smoking models were built included adults only.
For those with a home-smoking status of 1, we then
calculated the predicted number of cigarettes smoked daily
according to their sociodemographic characteristics and
geographic location using model 1b. Based on previous
literature, on average people spend approximately one third
of their time outside of the home, one third of their time
inside the home during waking hours, and one third of their
time inside the home during non-waking hours (Klepeis,
1999; Nazaroff and Singer, 2004). Therefore, we assumed
that our study population spends one half of its waking time
inside home, and multiplied the predicted daily number of
cigarettes by a factor of 0.5 to obtain the predicted daily
number of cigarettes smoked at home (Table 1b). We
assumed a constant rate of smoking; although it is possible
that more cigarettes are smoked outside of working hours
given the increasing smoking restrictions in public places, no
information was available on this and we chose to use a linear
rate based on previous literature (Klepeis and Nazaroff,
2006).
Air Exchange Model
To estimate air exchange rates for the houses in the AHS data
set, we used a previously published regression model
developed using a residential leakage database for single-
family detached homes (Chan et al., 2005). Homes were
separated into conventional and low income, and model
parameters were applied to calculate normalized leakage
based on year built and floor area. Floor area was reported as
an ordinal variable in the AHS, whereas year built was
reported in interval categories. For our calculations, each
home was assigned the midpoint of its year-built category.
Year built was top-coded at 2000 and floor area at 600 m2
(which fell at the 96th percentile of the AHS data), to
maintain consistency with the residential leakage database
used to develop the air exchange model. Floor area was
missing for 7914 houses and was estimated by multiplying
the number of rooms in these houses by the median room size
in the data set (25 m2). Normalized leakage was translated
into air changes per hour (ACH) using an equation described
by Chan et al., 2005. An additional factor of two was applied
for multi-unit housing structures, based on a previous study,
which analyzed all currently available data on multi-unit
housing structures and reported that multi-unit housing
structures are on average twice as leaky per unit area as
single-unit homes, with little systematic variation in building
leakage by construction type, building activity type, height,
size, or location within the United States (Price et al., 2006).
Although our approach is quite uncertain, direct application
of the Chan et al. model to multi-family housing was not
appropriate and no additional data sources were available;
we consider the implications of this assumption within our
analysis.
ETS Concentration Estimation
Screening-level estimates of residential ETS concentrations
were calculated using a single-zone mass-balance equation,
assuming perfect mixing: C ¼ (Q/V)/(a þk), where:
1. C ¼ equilibrium concentration (mg/m3)
2. Q ¼ emission rate (mg/h)
3. V ¼volume of housing unit (m3)
4. a ¼air exchange rate (1/h)
5. k ¼deposition rate (1/h)
Emission and deposition parameters were selected based
on previously reported central estimates: we used 10 mg per
cigarette for PM emissions and 0.1/h for particle deposition
loss-rate coefficient (Klepeis and Nazaroff, 2006). These
previously reported central estimates were based on an
assimilation of multiple previous studies (Klepeis et al., 2003;
Martin et al., 1997; Xu et al., 1994).
Statistical Analysis of Estimated ETS-PM Concentrations
Multiple analyses were conducted on the resulting ETS-PM
concentrations to develop broadly applicable models describ-
ing the association of ETS-PM with sociodemographic and
geographic variables available across the United States. The
analyses were performed at the household level rather than
the individual level, because our study population is clustered
within households. Given available information, we assumed
that all individuals within a household are exposed to the
same equilibrium concentrations of residential ETS, though
time-activity pattern differences could clearly lead to
differential personal exposures.
We restricted the household predictors to variables
available both in the AHS data set and cross-tabulated in
the United States census by census tract. A census tract is a
small statistical subdivision of a county, containing 2500­
8000 persons (US Census Bureau, 2000). We chose census
tracts as our geographic resolution because they were
designed to be homogeneous with respect to population
characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The
United States census provides summary tables for singular
household variables, and cross-tabulations of selected vari-
ables. The largest cross-tabulation of multiple householder
demographic variables available is as follows: householder
race by householder age by household income. We also

included dummy variables for census region and urban/rural
status.
A logistic regression model was fit to estimate the predic-
ted probability of non-zero ETS-PM in the indoor home
environment with respect to the above variables (model 2a).
For the subset of people with non-zero residential ETS
concentrations, a log-linear regression model was fit to
describe the distribution of ETS-PM concentrations in the
indoor home environment (model 2b). These regression
models were fit for each of the 1000 simulated data sets, and
we report results representing the mean across regression
model fits.
Results
Models 1a and 1b: Home-Smoking Prevalence and Daily
Cigarettes Smoked in CPS-TUS
The average prevalence of home smokers in the TUS data set
was 10.9%, compared with an overall smoking prevalence of
17.7%. The difference is attributable to the fact that 39.7%
of smokers reported having smoke-free homes. The mean
number of total daily cigarettes smoked by home smokers
was 16.2. Examining the characteristics of the subset with
missing data on home-smoking rules showed similar overall
smoking prevalence to the overall population and no
significant differences in sociodemographic covariates, except
that it contains more people in the 18­24 age group and
fewer people in the never-married group than the general
study population.
Models 1a and 1b shared many common patterns
(Tables 2 and 3). The reference population was White non-
Hispanic women aged 45­54 with a high school degree who
are native United States citizens, currently married, have an
annual household income between $30­60,000 and live with
two or more people; the reference geographic categories
were census region 3 (i.e., South) and Metropolitan balance
(i.e., not a central city). Compared with the reference
population, higher odds of smoking at home and higher
number of daily cigarettes among home smokers were found
in White Non-Hispanic males, native United States citizens,
and those with lower education levels. A U-shaped pattern
was observed for age, peaking at age 45­54 in both models.
Living in a metropolitan suburb was associated with lower
odds of home smoking, as was living in the Western United
States (census region 4). The effect of gender differed by race
in both models, as indicated by statistically significant
interaction terms.
Significant effect modification was found between census
region and race in model 1a (Table 2). This is consistent with
previous findings, which showed the effect of race to differ by
state (Osypuk et al., 2006; Chahine, 2010). However, this
interaction was not statistically significant in model 1b, and
was not retained in the final model (Table 3). Other key
differences were that people living alone were more likely to
be home smokers but smoked fewer cigarettes relative to
home smokers living with two or more people; those living in
metropolitan central cities were also more likely to smoke but
smoked significantly fewer cigarettes. As indicated by the
95% confidence intervals in Table 3, although annual
household income was one of the most significant predictors
of home smoking, it did not predict the number of cigarettes

smoked by home smokers. In general, as can be seen from
the confidence intervals in Tables 2 and 3, most predictors
had weaker associations with the outcome in model 1b
compared with model 1a. This could be due to smaller
sample size and a lesser effect of demographic and geographic
factors on smoking intensity of home smokers.
Air Exchange and ETS-PM Simulations in AHS
Estimated ACH ranged from 0.07­2.7. The mean estimated
ACH was 0.5/h, with a median of 0.4/h and standard
deviation of 0.4/h. Slight regional variations were observed,
with the highest air exchange rates in the Northeast (mean
0.6/h, median ¼ 0.5/h) and lowest in the South (mean 0.4/h,
median ¼ 0.3/h).
Across all 1000 simulated datasets, the mean prevalence of
smoking at home in our AHS study population was 10.9%,
similar to the TUS study population, with a mean number of
cigarettes predicted for home smokers of 14.9, slightly lower
than the mean of 16.2 observed in the TUS. Approximately
17% of homes had non-zero ETS concentrations. The mean
household concentration of ETS-PM in the total population
across individual homes and simulations was 2.8 mg/m3, with
a median of zero and a SD of 8.9. In the exposed subset, the
mean household concentration was 16.3 mg/m3 (median
13.0 mg/m3, SD 15.9); the 99th percentile was 67 mg/m3 and
the maximum concentration reached over 499 mg/m3, in-
dicating that a small percentage of the population is predicted
to be exposed to extremely high concentrations of ETS-PM.
Figure 1 presents box-plots of ETS-PM concentrations for
key covariates.
Models 2a and 2b: Statistical Analysis of Estimated
ETS-PM Concentrations
Odds of ETS exposure (model 2a) showed similar patterns of
association with many householder covariates as was
observed in the underlying smoking prevalence model with
individual covariates (model 1a), with the exception of race
(Table 4). Concentrations of ETS-PM in the exposed
population (model 2b) showed similar patterns of association
with householder covariates as was observed in the under-
lying number of cigarettes model with individual covariates
(model 1b), with the exception of census region (Table 5).
Although households in the Midwest had the highest odds of
exposure, exposed households in the South had the highest
mean concentrations after controlling for all covariates. This
reflects the role of housing characteristics in determining
ETS-PM concentrations, as the lowest air exchange rates
were estimated in the South.
A non-monotonic relationship was observed between
household income and ETS-PM concentration in exposed
homes, where households in the second lowest income
quartile had the highest concentration (Table 5). This is a
result of the low-income air exchange model provided by
Chan et al. (2005) and the factor of two that we further
applied to attached units (which are most prevalent in the
lowest income category). R-square values for the log-linear
regression models were on the order of 0.2, indicating that a
substantial proportion of variability in ETS-PM concentra-
tions remains unexplained by the covariates we controlled
for. Standard errors of the individual models (n ¼ 1000) were
on the same order as the SD of the mean parameter estimates
(intercept and coefficients, denoted by b) for both models
shown in Tables 4 and 5, indicating that the model is
appropriately characterizing uncertainty (results not shown).
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that the substantial variability in
residential ETS concentrations, driven by variability in both

interpretable and help identify sociodemographic and geo-
graphic sub-populations in the United States, which are at
higher risk of elevated ETS exposures.
The mean estimated ETS-PM concentration of 16 mg/m3
for exposed households in our study falls on the lower side of
the range of concentrations measured in previous large-scale
residential ETS studies (Dockery and Spengler, 1981;
Leaderer, 1990; Ozkaynak et al., 1996). Our results are also
in agreement with recent modeling studies: Klepeis et al
reported means ranging from 6.6­49 mg/m3 from multiple
simulations using a simple box model approach; and Myatt
et al reported a mean of 15mg/m3 and a median of 17.8mg/m3
using the CONTAM model (Klepeis and Nazaroff, 2006;
Myatt et al., 2008). These studies incorporated time-activity
patterns and ventilation patterns but relied on a hypothetical
smoking population, whereas our study is a snapshot
characterization of equilibrium concentrations based on para-
meters estimated from a national survey. Thus, although these
studies showed that exposure concentrations may vary within a
household depending on ventilation behavior and time-activity
patterns of occupants, our study suggests that time-averaged
concentrations can vary between households depending
on smoking patterns and house type, volume, and age (all of
which vary between sociodemographic and geographic
subpopulations).
In our multiple logistic and linear regression models we
attempted to capture variability in log odds of ETS exposure
(model 2a) and concentrations of ETS-PM in exposed
populations (model 2b) using covariates available across the
United States from the census. Although the majority of
estimated parameters were consistent with those of models 1a
and 1b (e.g., U-shaped curve for age, higher exposure in
rural locations and the Midwest), some parameters had
differing relationships for ETS than for smoking. In
particular, race was not a significant predictor of residential
ETS exposure in model 2a. One possible explanation is that
the grouping of the variables was modified in order to be
consistent with the 2000 census. Race/ethnicity were grouped
together in model 1a, to maintain integrity with the original
smoking model from which it was developed, which was
determined based on the previous literature. However, the
2000 census presents race without the ethnicity component.
In model 1a, the log odds for the black ­non-Hispanic
indicator variable was borderline significant at P ¼ 0.046,
whereas the log odds for the Hispanic indicator variable was
highly significant at Po0.001. The association captured in
model 1a may have been largely due to the ethnicity
component rather than the race component, which was not
captured by the race variable in model 2a.
Our findings can be additionally evaluated by contrasting
them with studies examining cotinine levels among children,
taken from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES). Among children with reported smoke
exposure at home (paralleling our model 2b), cotinine levels
were significantly higher with low parental education, white
ethnicity (relative to Mexican-American ethnicity), and
households with fewer rooms, with a borderline significant
effect of poverty and no significant difference by region or
white/black race (Mannino et al., 2001). Although our
findings are not directly comparable given different covari-
ates, and the NHANES study includes factors influencing
metabolism and dosimetry, both studies reinforce the
importance of housing factors and more complex associa-
tions with household income than seen in studies of smoking
patterns.
One of the major uncertainties in our analysis relates to
our modeling of air exchange rates. We applied a model
developed for single-family detached units and adapted the
model to accommodate attached units. The literature on air
exchange rates in attached housing units is scarce, and
theoretical understanding of factors influencing air exchange
could lead us to argue for either higher or lower air exchange
relative to detached units. On one hand, the lack of a ceiling/
roof providing a direct pathway to the outdoors and the
smaller ratio of exterior wall area per unit of interior volume
in attached homes may point to smaller air exchange rates.
On the other hand, larger buildings may contain more
opportunity for leakage such as cracks and leaks; the natural
physical forces that move air (e.g., wind and stack effect) are
more pronounced in taller buildings and there may be weaker
financial incentives for energy-efficient construction or retro-
fits (Diamond et al., 1996). Our choice of multiplying by a
factor of two for attached units is based on a study, which
analyzed all available data on multi-family homes and
reported greater leakage and a larger air exchange rate than
single-family homes (Price et al., 2006). To assess the
sensitivity of our results on this assumption, we removed
the factor of two and repeated our analysis. This did not
change the general patterns observed in model 2a and 2b
(results not shown). In the absence of a larger body of
knowledge on air exchange in multi-family housing, we relied
on this analysis, but additional data collection would clearly
be warranted.
Our study has a number of additional limitations. First,
lack of state and metropolitan area identifiers for over half
the study population in the AHS prevented us from using
more detailed geographic inputs in the smoking model.
Although this reduced our predictive power, these inputs
were previously shown to have a smaller contribution to
predicting smoking variability than individual sociodemo-
graphic variables (Chahine, 2010). Given our inclusion of
geographic information in the form of census region and
urban status indicator variables, we believe that our model
still captures much of the variability in smoking that can be
predicted with available covariates. Second, the use of a
simple box model to estimate ETS concentrations may not
adequately capture indoor conditions, given the multi-com-
partment nature of most houses. For a more sophisticated

exposure assessment, the use of a more detailed model
accounting for differences in smoking rules within a house,
number of rooms, movement of people, and ventilation
information is required. However, because our aim is to
provide screening-level estimates, we chose a simple box
model. Third, although the previously published air exchange
model used in our study established that higher leakage rates
are found in low-income homes, the data used for such
homes came from a state database and the model likely does
not capture variability in leakage in different regions of the
United States (Chan et al., 2005).
Beyond the concerns mentioned above, our study does not
take into account exchange between units in the same
building, which may be a substantial contributor of ETS, nor
the variability in air exchange rates for different units in the
same building (Bohac et al., 2007). Another limitation is that
the simulated home smoking includes adults aged 18 and
above only, which may result in an underestimation of
residential ETS exposure. Finally, our simulation method
does not formally take into account, which individuals in our
data set live in the same homes. Although model 1a
incorporates within-house correlations in smoking into the
b-parameters used to estimate predicted probability of home
smoking, the random number generation method does not
further incorporate information on individuals living in the
same home in the AHS data set (i.e., the likelihood that a
smoker will live with another smoker, beyond the demo-
graphic factors that predict individual behaviors).
More generally, the results of our ETS-PM regression
models shed light on the average differences between sub-
population groups as represented by household income,
householder race, and householder's age, using variables that
are universally available at the census tract level. However,
other factors remain which influence residential ETS
exposure and which have not been controlled for. Therefore,
although our estimates are an improvement on national
averages, use of our model should be restricted to screening
purposes, to identify likely exposure hot spots where more
detailed local data could be gathered and to inform screening-
level community cumulative exposure assessments.
Despite these limitations, this study leverages data from
three national data sets to provide screening estimates of
residential ETS exposure in demographic and geographic
sub-populations across the United States. Although previous
studies used average smoking and air exchange statistics in
ETS exposure simulations, our study captures variability in
residential smoking patterns and housing characteristics,
including factors that correlate with both smoking and air
exchange. Our approach, although constrained in the
predictors included, would theoretically allow for ETS
exposure to be systematically estimated for a census tract
given its location and demographic cross-tabulations.
Future studies should investigate correlations between ETS
and other residential pollutants to determine whether
sub-populations with highest ETS exposure are also more
exposed to other indoor sources.
Although no relative risks are established for health
outcomes from ETS-PM, evidence based on ambient PM
with appropriate adjustments for personal exposures vs
outdoor concentrations could allow for a screening-level
characterization of risk from residential ETS-PM exposure.
To contextualize this risk, the annual average residential
ETS-PM concentration of 16 mg/m3 that we have estimated
for exposed households in the United States is higher than
the annual average outdoor PM2.5
concentration of 12 mg/m3
reported for 2007 (US EPA, 2008). Further, others have
stated that exposure to indoor PM is as hazardous, if not
more hazardous, than exposure to outdoor PM (Nazaroff
and Singer, 2004; Repace, 2007). Although only a subset
of the population is exposed to residential ETS-PM, and
relative risks may differ between the mixture of particles in
ambient PM and those in ETS-PM, the health risks may be
of a similar order of magnitude as those from ambient PM
for this exposed sub-population.
More generally, by providing estimates of ETS-PM
concentration distributions for different sub-populations,
we allow for future risk assessments that move beyond
``living with a smoker (yes/no)'' exposure classification.
These estimates are a useful starting point for communities
interested in characterizing cumulative health risks from
indoor air pollutants, which are likely substantial contribu-
tors to population disease burdens.
