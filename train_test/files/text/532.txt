Abstract
Background: Debate has surrounded the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes for decades. Some have argued
medical marijuana legalization (MML) poses a threat to public health and safety, perhaps also affecting crime rates. In recent
years, some U.S. states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes, reigniting political and public interest in the impact
of marijuana legalization on a range of outcomes.
Methods: Relying on U.S. state panel data, we analyzed the association between state MML and state crime rates for all Part
I offenses collected by the FBI.
Findings: Results did not indicate a crime exacerbating effect of MML on any of the Part I offenses. Alternatively, state MML
may be correlated with a reduction in homicide and assault rates, net of other covariates.
Conclusions: These findings run counter to arguments suggesting the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes poses
a danger to public health in terms of exposure to violent crime and property crimes.

Introduction
The social ramifications of marijuana legalization have been
hotly debated for at least four decades [1]. Despite a long history of
marijuana use for medical purposes, policymakers and in some
instances, the scientific community, have been quick to note the
potential problematic social outcomes of marijuana legalization
[2]. In spite of these political discussions, medical marijuana
legalization (MML) has occurred in 20 states and the District of
Columbia (between 1996 and the writing of this paper) and its
recreational use has now been legalized in Colorado and
Washington [3]. An interest in the ramifications of these laws
has led to an increase in scholarly activity on the topic [4], [5]. The
issue addressed in this article is whether MML has the effect of
increasing crime. While there are many mechanisms by which
MML might affect crime rates, the most obvious is by increasing
the number of marijuana users, which may lead to a broader social
acceptance of drug using behaviors and drug users [6]. To the
extent that marijuana use serves as a ``gateway'' to harder drugs
such as cocaine and heroin, MML could lead to long-term
increases in crime as an ever-growing number of illicit drug users
engage in serious predatory crimes to support their habits (but see
[7]). But even if MML does not lead to a rise in marijuana use
(especially among youth), the laws could still stimulate crime as
newly opened medical marijuana dispensaries provide criminals
with a highly attractive target with their repository of high quality
marijuana and customers carrying large amounts of cash (but see
[8]). As a member of the California Chiefs of Police Association
stated, ``A disturbing and continuing trend is the increasing
number of home invasion robberies and associated violence
resulting in the victimization of those cultivating and possessing
marijuana ... [D]ispensaries also continue to be targeted based
upon the availability of larger quantities of drugs and cash'' (see
http://californiapolicechiefs.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/
July_September_2010_Final.pdf). Though anecdotal evidence
abounds to support both theses, and a few single-jurisdiction and
cross-sectional studies have examined the MML-crime link (e.g.,
[9]), no single analysis has assessed the overall consequences of
medical marijuana laws on crime rates across the United States.
This study seeks to inform the debate by providing a comprehen-
sive evaluation of the effects of state MML on state crime rates.
The Positive Correlation between Marijuana Use and
Criminal Behavior
Though the gateway hypothesis applies to the progression of
drug-using behaviors, there remains the possibility that marijuana
use leads to delinquent or criminal behavior via a similar
mechanism. A number of studies have specifically examined the
relationship between marijuana use and crime [10], [11], [12],
[13], [14]. Early studies compared the amount of crimes
committed by juveniles whose urine tested positive for marijuana
upon entering a detention center and those committed by
individuals who tested negative for marijuana. Dembo and
associates [15], [16], for instance, found that youths who tested
positive for marijuana had a significantly higher number of

referrals to juvenile court for nondrug felonies than those testing
negative for marijuana use.
Arseneault and colleagues [17] examined the relationship
between marijuana dependence and the risk for violence in a
sample of New Zealand adolescents. The authors controlled for
gender, socioeconomic status, and many other concurrent
disorders and concluded that marijuana dependence was related
to a 280 percent increase in the odds of violence. This association
was stronger than the individual effects of manic disorder, alcohol
dependence, and schizophrenia. In a study using data collected
from school-age adolescents in the Netherlands, those who
reported marijuana use tended to report more delinquent and
aggressive behaviors [18]. This relationship was significant after
controlling for variables such as alcohol and tobacco use and the
strength of the relationship increased with higher frequency of
marijuana use. This study is noteworthy because marijuana use is
decriminalized in the Netherlands, thus the relationship is unlikely
to be based on the fact that marijuana users have to participate in
the illegal market and are therefore at an increased risk for
violence. While these studies were cross-sectional and show a
correlation between current marijuana use and criminality or
violent behaviors, other scholars have examined the link with
longitudinal data.
Using multi-wave data, research has shown adolescents who
reported marijuana use at age 15 were more likely to report violent
involvement at age 19, indicating that marijuana use, particularly
during adolescence may impact violent behavior in young
adulthood [19]. Similarly, research has shown that frequent
marijuana use during adolescence was a strong predictor of being
involved in intimate partner violence [5]. Results revealed that
consistent marijuana use during adolescence was related to a 108
percent increase in the likelihood of being involved in intimate
partner violence in young adulthood and consistent marijuana use
was associated with an 85 percent increase in the odds of being the
perpetrator of intimate partner violence, independent of alcohol
use.
These studies provide evidence to the notion that marijuana use
is at a minimum correlated with an increase in violent or
aggressive behaviors. What remains unclear is whether these
findings imply a causal link between marijuana use and violence or
whether the relationship is driven by an uncontrolled variable(s)
(i.e., a spurious correlation). Along these lines, it could be argued
that the relationship between violence and marijuana use is
primarily due to its illegality and thus would not exist in an
environment in which marijuana use, at least medicinally, is
legalized.
The Negative or Null Correlation between Marijuana Use
and Criminal Behavior
Most researchers who have examined the relationship between
marijuana use and crime report that these laws do not have an
effect on violent crime [20], [21]. Green and associates [20], for
instance, concluded that while marijuana use was related to an
increase in drug and property crime, it was not related to an
increase in violent crime. Pedersen and Skardhamar [21] also
found a relationship between marijuana use and subsequent arrest,
although once the authors removed all types of drug charges from
the models, the relationship was no longer significant. Results
revealed no evidence that marijuana use was related to an increase
in later non-drug arrest, such as arrests for violent crimes. The
authors argued that the association between marijuana use and
crime appears to exist because of its illegality. Thus, if the
possession and sale of marijuana was legal the relationship
between marijuana and crime might disappear.
It has been argued that medicinal marijuana laws may increase
crime because the dispensaries and grow houses provide an
opportunity for property crime and violent crime to occur, such as
burglary and robbery. Kepple and Freisthler [9] examined the
relationship between medical marijuana dispensaries and crime
and their results suggested that after controlling for a host of
ecological variables, no relationship existed between medicinal
marijuana dispensaries and property or violent crime. Additional
research has shown that medical marijuana dispensaries may
actually reduce crime within the immediate vicinity of the
dispensaries [8]. This may be due to the security measures
implemented by dispensary owners (i.e., having security cameras,
having a doorman, and having signs requiring identification).
Importantly, medical marijuana dispensaries do not appear to
increase crime in their surrounding areas.
In sum, research on the relationship between medicinal
marijuana and crime is mixed. Studies have shown that states
allowing the use of medical marijuana have higher prevalence
rates of marijuana use [13], [14], yet other studies have found that
legalized medicinal marijuana does not lead to an increase in its
overall use [21], [22]. Research has also suggested that marijuana
use is associated with an increase in illicit drug use [23], [19] and
an increase in crime [17], [19], [16]. Others, however, have
revealed that marijuana is not related to additional illicit drug use
[22], [7], [17] or crime [8], [20], [9], [21]. Thus, the available
evidence is equivocal and in need of a rigorous evaluation of the
MML-crime relationship.
Methods
Data & Measures
Dependent Variables. Data on all seven Part I offenses--
homicide, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and auto
theft--for each state between 1990 and 2006 were obtained from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting
(UCR) Program, published as Crime in the United States. The data
were obtained using the ``data for analysis'' tool on the Bureau of
Justice Statistics Web site (http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/dtd.
htm). All data were gathered for each of the 50 U.S. states across
the 17 year time span for a total N = 850. Values reflect the rate of
each crime per 100,000 residents.
Medical Marijuana Legalization (MML). To determine if
and when MML occurred within a state, we searched the official
legislative website of each US state. Between 1990 and 2006, the
following 11 states legalized marijuana for medical use, with the
year the law was passed in parentheses: Alaska (1998), California
(1996), Colorado (2000), Hawaii (2000), Maine (1999), Montana
(2004), Nevada (2000), Oregon (1998), Rhode Island (2006),
Vermont (2004), and Washington (1998). We also ran models
based on MML ``legislation-effective year'' rather than ``legisla-
tion-passed year'' and found no substantive differences in the
results. The MML effective dates were also gathered from each
State's official legislative website. Only 2 states (Connecticut and
Colorado) had an MML effective year different than ``passed''
year, both being only a 1-year difference. While there are many
options in modeling the effects of MML adoption on crime, we
opted to use a post-law trend variable. The trend variable
represents the number of years the law has been in effect with a
value of zero for all years before the law was passed, a value of 1
for the year the law was passed, and a value of 1+k, where k =
number of years after the initial passage of the law, for all
subsequent years. Unlike the traditional ``dummy variable''
approach (i.e., 0 = no MML law, 1 = MML law), which posits
a once-and-for-all impact on crime, the post-law trend variable
The Effect of Medical Marijuana Laws on Crime

captures any changes in the linear trend of crime that may be
observed over time. If opponents of MML are correct that the laws
lead to increased marijuana use by teenagers, many of whom are
likely to continue illicit hard drug use throughout their adulthood,
one might expect a gradual increase in crime over time. Such an
effect would be best captured by the post-law trend variable.
Sociodemographic Control Variables. Sociodemographic
variables were included in the analysis to aid in controlling for a
vast array of other time-varying influences that might be potential
confounding factors over the study period. These variables, and
their sources, have been described previously [24]. Specifically,
they include each state's percent of the civilian labor force
unemployed; the total employment rate; percent of the population
living below the poverty line; real per-capita income (divided by
the Consumer Price Index); the proportion of residents aged 15Â­
24; the proportion of residents aged 25Â­34, the proportion of
residents aged 35Â­44 years; the per-capita rate of beer consump-
tion [25]; the proportion of residents with at least a bachelor's
degree; and the percent of the state's population that lived in a
metropolitan area. State-level unemployment data were obtained
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (www.bls.gov/sae/
home). Data on poverty were acquired via the Bureau of the
Census website (www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty). Personal
income and real welfare payments data were taken from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis website (www.bea.doc.gov/bea/
regional/reis). The age variables were obtained directly from the
U.S. Bureau of the Census. Data on beer consumption were taken
from the Beer Institute website (www.beerinstitute.org). The
percent of the population with college degrees or higher and the
percent of the population living in a metropolitan area are linear
interpolations of decennial census data, as reported in various
editions of the Statistical Abstracts of the United States.
Additional measures included the number of prison inmates per
100,000 residents and the number of police officers per 100,000
residents. The number of prisoners was measured as the number
of prisoners sentenced to more than a year in custody as of
December 31 per 100,000 residents and was obtained from the
Bureau of Justice Statistic's website (www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs). Data
on the total number of police, including civilians, were taken from
the Public Employment series prepared by the Bureau of the
Census. Louisiana and Mississippi were missing information on
this variable for the year 2006, therefore reducing the usable case
count by two units. Substantive results were identical when values
for this year were imputed with values from the previous year.
Summary statistics for these explanatory variables are presented in
Table 1.
Analysis Plan
To identify the effect of MML on crime, we use a fixed-effects
panel design, exploiting the within state variation introduced by
the passage of MML in 11 states over the 17 year observation
period. The design allows for the assessment of whether states
adopting MML experienced changes in the trend of crime by
analyzing within state changes in crime rates over time and
comparing those changes to the crime rate trends among states
that did not pass an MML law. To carry out this analysis, we
estimate fixed-effects ordinary least squares regression models,
where the natural log of each crime rate variable (i.e., homicide,
rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and auto theft) is the
dependent variable. This model directly accounts for dynamic
factors that cause crime to vary from state to state, as well as those
stable unmeasured factors that differ between states [26], [27]. In
addition, we also include ``year fixed-effects,'' which capture any
national influences on crime that are not captured in any of the
time-varying explanatory variables. Robust standard errors are
clustered at the state level to avoid biased standard errors due to
the non-independence of data points over time [28]. Thus, the
fixed effects models can be expressed algebraically following the
convention set forth by Wooldridge [27] as:
log (
y

where:

It is important to note that fixed-effects models are not without
limitations. While they are well suited to address the issue at hand
and account for unobserved time-invariant factors, they are always

vulnerable to time-varying factors that are not accounted for that
differ between states with MML and those without. However, we
have accounted for the bulk of factors that have been shown
associated with state crime rates and our models explain a
considerable amount of variation in each outcome. It is also
important to acknowledge that fixed-effects models do not account
for temporal ordering for time-varying predictors within a given
observation period. For example, it is unknown whether states
adopted MML after experiencing lower crime rates in a given
year(s), however, this is unlikely to be an issue here since policy
response to crime rates tend to take time and we account for this
via operationalization of MML as an additive effect.
Results
Primary Findings
Before consulting the results from the fixed effects regression
models, a series of unconditioned crime rates for each offense type
were generated and are presented in Figure 1. Note that two crime
rate trends are presented in each panel. One trend--the solid
line--shows the crime rate, by year, for states that had not passed
an MML law. Thus, states that eventually did pass an MML law
contribute to the solid line up until the year that they passed the
MML law. As expected from the overall crime trend during this
time period, the solid line reveals that all states experienced a
reduction in each of the seven crimes from 1990 to 2006.
Important to note is the trend revealed by the dashed line, which
shows the crime rate trends for states after passing an MML law.
With one exception--forcible rape--states passing MML laws
experienced reductions in crime and the rate of reduction appears
to be steeper for states passing MML laws as compared to others
for several crimes such as homicide, robbery, and aggravated
assault. The raw number of homicides, robberies, and aggravated
assaults also appear to be lower for states passing MML as
compared to other states, especially from 1998Â­2006. These
preliminary results suggest MML may have a crime-reducing
effect, but recall that these are unconditional averages, meaning
that the impact of the covariates and other factors related to time
series trends have not been accounted for in these figures.
The results of the fixed effects analyses are presented in Table 2.
It is important to note that a Hausman test was carried out to
determine whether the fixed effects model was preferable over the
random effects model; the latter model is more parsimonious and,
thus, should be preferred when results do not systematically differ
across the two approaches. The results of the Hausman tests (with
year fixed effects omitted for both equations because they are
inestimable in the random effects model) suggested that the fixed
effects model was preferred in each of the seven analyses. For
reference, the Hausman x2 values were 302.61, 23.64, 102.50,
414.94, 58.87, 34.18, and 31.28 for homicide, rape, robbery,
assault, burglary, larceny, and auto theft, respectively.
The key results gleaned from the fixed effects analyses are
presented in row 1 of Table 2, which reveals the impact of the
MML trend variable on crime rates, while controlling for the other
time-varying explanatory variables. Two findings worth noting
emerged from the different fixed effects regression analyses. First,
the impact of MML on crime was negative or not statistically
significant in all but one of the models, suggesting the passage of
MML may have a dampening effect on certain crimes. The second
key finding was that the coefficients capturing the impact of MML
on homicide and assault were the only two that emerged as
statistically significant. Specifically, the results indicate approxi-
mately a 2.4 percent reduction in homicide and assault,
respectively, for each additional year the law is in effect. Because
log-linear models were estimated, the coefficient must be
transformed according to the following formula to generate
percentage changes in crime for a one-unit increase in MML:
e(b-1)*100 [27]. However, it is important to note that the finding for
homicide was less variable (i.e., a lower standard error) as
compared to assault. One might argue a Bonferroni correction is
necessary given the exploratory nature of the study and the
multiple models that were analyzed. Once a Bonferroni correction
was carried out (i.e., a/7), only the effect of MML on homicide
remained statistically significant (.05/7 = .007). Perhaps the most
important finding in Table 2 is the lack of evidence of any increase
in robbery or burglary, which are the type of crimes one might
expect to gradually increase over time if the MML-crime thesis
was correct. Thus, in the end, MML was not found to have a
crime enhancing effect for any of the crime types analyzed.
Sensitivity Analyses
The fixed effects models presented above were subjected to a
range of sensitivity tests to determine whether the findings were
robust to alternative model specifications. First, and as previously
noted, data for the two missing cases were imputed using matched
case replacement for Louisiana and Mississippi. Importantly,
substantive results were identical when this strategy was carried
out. A second sensitivity analysis explored the possibility that the
effect of MML on crime rates was non-linear. No evidence
emerged to support the hypothesis that MML has a non-linear
effect on crime rate trends. Third, a related issue concerns whether
the MML effect has both a trend effect (shown above) and a one-
time shock effect. We considered this issue by including the MML
trend variable (discussed above) along with a dummy variable
coded 0 for years when no MML law was present (by state) and
coded 1 in years when an MML law had been passed. The
findings were practically identical to those shown above: the MML
trend variable was negatively related to homicide (b = 2.02,
p,.10) and assault (b = 2.02, p,.10). A fourth sensitivity analysis
re-estimated the original models (shown above), by weighting each
state proportional to its population size. When these weighted
fixed effects models were estimated, the substantive findings were
somewhat different than those presented above. Specifically, the
effect of MML on homicide rates was no longer statistically
significant (b = 2.01, p = .30), MML negatively predicted robbery
rates (b = 2.02, p,.10), MML negatively predicted assault rates
(b = 2.03, p,.01), and MML positively predicted auto theft rates
(b = .03, p,.05). While it is common in the crime policy literature
to weight observations by resident population to correct for
possible heteroskedasticity, this will be the efficient feasible GLS
(generalized least squares) procedure only if the heteroskedasticity
takes a particular form, i.e. variance proportional to the square of
the population. In the present study, the unweighted results
produce findings that are substantively consistent with the
weighted results, although they differ slightly quantitatively. The
most likely explanation for this discrepancy is that the weighted
results are driven by a few large population states. For this reason,
we present the unweighted results as the main results and the
weighted results as part of our numerous robustness checks.
Discussion and Conclusion
The effects of legalized medical marijuana have been passion-
ately debated in recent years. Empirical research on the direct
relationship between medical marijuana laws and crime, however,
is scant and the consequences of marijuana use on crime remain
unknown. Studies have shown that marijuana use was associated
with higher prevalence of subsequent illicit drug use [19] and an

increased risk of violence [17]. Yet, other studies have found that
once additional factors were controlled for, there was no
relationship between marijuana use and later serious drug use
[7]. Research has also shown that marijuana use is not related to
violent crime when measured at the individual-level [20]. Once
drug charges are controlled for, Pedersen and Skardhamar [21]
reported that the relationship between marijuana and crime was
not significantly different from zero. Unfortunately, no study has
examined the effect of legalized medical marijuana on state crime
rates across the United States. The current study sought to fill this
gap by assessing the effect of legalized medicinal marijuana on the
seven Part I UCR offenses. The analysis was the first to look at
multiple offenses across multiple states and time periods to explore
whether MML impacts state crime rates.
The central finding gleaned from the present study was that
MML is not predictive of higher crime rates and may be related to
reductions in rates of homicide and assault. Interestingly, robbery
and burglary rates were unaffected by medicinal marijuana
legislation, which runs counter to the claim that dispensaries and
grow houses lead to an increase in victimization due to the
opportunity structures linked to the amount of drugs and cash that
are present. Although, this is in line with prior research suggesting
that medical marijuana dispensaries may actually reduce crime in
the immediate vicinity [8].
In sum, these findings run counter to arguments suggesting the
legalization of marijuana for medical purposes poses a danger to
public health in terms of exposure to violent crime and property
crimes. To be sure, medical marijuana laws were not found to have
a crime exacerbating effect on any of the seven crime types. On
the contrary, our findings indicated that MML precedes a
reduction in homicide and assault. While it is important to remain
cautious when interpreting these findings as evidence that MML
reduces crime, these results do fall in line with recent evidence [29]
and they conform to the longstanding notion that marijuana

The Effect of Medical Marijuana Laws on Crime
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92816
legalization may lead to a reduction in alcohol use due to
individuals substituting marijuana for alcohol [see generally 29,
30]. Given the relationship between alcohol and violent crime
[31], it may turn out that substituting marijuana for alcohol leads
to minor reductions in violent crimes that can be detected at the
state level. That said, it also remains possible that these
associations are statistical artifacts (recall that only the homicide
effect holds up when a Bonferroni correction is made).
Given that the current results failed to uncover a crime
exacerbating effect attributable to MML, it is important to
examine the findings with a critical eye. While we report no
positive association between MML and any crime type, this does
not prove MML has no effect on crime (or even that it reduces
crime). It may be the case that an omitted variable, or set of
variables, has confounded the associations and masked the true
positive effect of MML on crime. If this were the case, such a
variable would need to be something that was restricted to the
states that have passed MML, it would need to have emerged in
close temporal proximity to the passage of MML in all of those
states (all of which had different dates of passage for the marijuana
law), and it would need to be something that decreased crime to
such an extent that it ``masked'' the true positive effect of MML
(i.e., it must be something that has an opposite sign effect between
MML [e.g., a positive correlation] and crime [e.g., a negative
correlation]). Perhaps the more likely explanation of the current
findings is that MML laws reflect behaviors and attitudes that have
been established in the local communities. If these attitudes and
behaviors reflect a more tolerant approach to one another's
personal rights, we are unlikely to expect an increase in crime and
might even anticipate a slight reduction in personal crimes.
Moreover, the present findings should also be taken in context
with the nature of the data at hand. They are based on official
arrest records (UCR), which do not account for crimes not
reported to the police and do not account for all charges that may
underlie an arrest. In any case, this longitudinal assessment of
medical marijuana laws on state crime rates suggests that these
laws do not appear to have any negative (i.e., crime exacerbating)
impact on officially reported criminality during the years in which
the laws are in effect, at least when it comes to the types of
offending explored here. It is also important to keep in mind that
the UCR data used here did not account for juvenile offending,
which may or may not be empirically tethered to MML in some
form or another; an assessment of which is beyond the scope of
this study.
