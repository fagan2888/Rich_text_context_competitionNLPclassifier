There is no place like a restaurant for showcasing the feats
and follies of human memory. Flustered servers buzz around
tables prioritizing simultaneous requests in a desperate
effort to "save footsteps" and remember who ordered what.
It is no wonder that classic studies on memory mnemonics
have investigated the on-the-job performance of bartenders
(Beach, 1988) and waiters (Bekinschteina, Cardozoa, &
Manes, 2008; Bennett, 1983; Ericsson & Polson, 1988;
Zeigarnik, 1927, 1967) to discover the "tricks of the trade."
With three or four hot plates in hand, keeping track of where
the food is to be delivered can be difficult, especially when
inundated with details on individual food specification, and
table location, of the hungry guest who ordered it! Could
cognitive concepts, or known effects from cognitive psy-
chology, help in developing a system for plate delivery that
could minimize errors? As Bekinschteina et al. (2008)
showed in their study of waiters in Buenos Aires, who mem-
orize all the orders without written support, waiters can use
a feature/location strategy to link clients with position at the
table and food order. They suggest that memory-schemas
link working memory to long-term memory networks
through rapid encoding, making such information resistant
to interference and enabling its fast retrieval if necessary
cues are present. While this study suggests there are indeed
methods being used by experts to improve memory in real-
world situations, the authors suggest there is a need for more
lab-based studies that can directly manipulate factors
thought to influence memory performance. In this study, we
do just that by examining how a cognitive theory could be
used to aid memory in a real-life scenario in which memory
demands are high.
A series of cognitive studies by von Restorff (1933) dem-
onstrated that people make fewer errors when recalling atyp-
ical items (e.g., an isolated letter) presented within
homogeneous sets of numbers than when recalling items
(e.g., a particular number) presented within a homogeneous
set of numbers. This memory effect is analogous to the find-
ing in studies of perception, whereby a black square is more
distinct when portrayed within a white than gray background
(Craik, 1983). The von Restorff effect, also known as the
isolation effect, is robust (for reviews, see Schmidt, 1991;
Wallace, 1965). Essentially, the effect shows that when a dis-
tinctive item is embedded in a stimulus display of otherwise
related items, that item is retained significantly better than a
comparably located, but related item, in a similar set. It has
been observed with a variety of stimuli such as words, using
related paired associates compared with unrelated associates
(Kimble & Dufort, 1955); with digits mixed with syllables
compared with other digits (Fabiani & Donchin, 1995); and

Alpha Meals: Using Cognitive Psychology
to Boost Restaurant Server Performance
Myra A. Fernandes1, Ethan Miller1 and John L. Michela1
Abstract
Past research suggests that our ability to recall information increases when atypical items are presented within otherwise
homogeneous sets. We investigated whether this effect applied to performance on practical, everyday tasks. In a computer-
simulated restaurant scenario, participants acted as virtual servers, delivering "plates of food orders" to tables set up in
different "rooms." Plate destination was communicated using either a distinctive alphanumeric code or a homogeneous
numeric code, both of which indicated the room and table number for delivery of food orders. We examined accuracy
of plate delivery when two (low load) or three (high load) coded assignments were given per delivery trial. As expected,
performance declined from the low- to high-load condition. Importantly, performance declined less with alphanumeric
compared with all-numeric communication of assignments. Results suggest that increasing the distinctiveness of assignments,
by using alphanumeric codes, can boost performance in real-life situations to significantly improve memory-related task
performance, particularly when cognitive load is taxed.

with three-letter trigrams of consonants mixed with vowels,
compared with other consonants (Jenkins & Postman, 1948),
to name a few. The effect can also be used to confer an over-
all memorial advantage to lists containing an isolate; the
explanation being that under conditions in which an organi-
zational process on memory can occur, material is encoded
in a more structured manner, in turn producing greater mem-
ory performance (Cimbalo, Capria, Neider, & Wilkins, 1977;
Webster, Leland, & Bartlett, 1997). Recent work also sug-
gests this effect extends to spatial information. For example,
Guérard, Hughes, and Tremblay (2008) showed that short-
term serial recall was enhanced for both the location and the
serial position of a red dot when presented among a sequence
of otherwise black dots, highlighting the role of distinctive-
ness in enhancing memory. Based on these studies, we can
make predictions about how to maximize accuracy when
busy servers deliver plates of food to specific rooms and
table locations in a restaurant.
The current work extends this traditional research in the
cognitive domain to a real-life scenario. We examined the
role of distinctiveness of delivery instructions on memory
for location of plate deliveries to tables in a simulated res-
taurant setting. In contrast to studies of the isolation effect
that have examined retention of syllables, digits, or word
lists using conventional laboratory procedures, we created
a simulation of a work setting in which memory was central
to performance, and the form of encoding could draw upon
the von Restorff effect (or not). Specifically we manipu-
lated whether locations for plate deliveries were communi-
cated to servers using a number-only (homogeneous) or an
alphanumeric (atypical, or nonhomogeneous) coding sys-
tem for room and table location for plate delivery assign-
ments. Indeed, numerous large restaurants currently use a
numeric-only code to represent the destination for plates of
food. For example, orders are picked up from the kitchen,
with table location coded as a series of numbers, such as
421, signifying delivery to Table 21, in Room 4. As sug-
gested by the recent popularity of television cooking shows,
in high-pressure restaurant environments (e.g., Fox broad-
casting's popular show Hell's Kitchen), and video games
that simulate high-pressure restaurant scenarios (e.g.,
Restaurant Empire, Enlight Software, USA), there is a need
for optimizing plate delivery in large restaurant settings,
with multiple rooms. What sets apart good versus poor
waiters is not their ability to remember a couple of orders,
but instead it is their ability to recall multiple orders and
locations (Bennett, 1983; Ericsson & Polson, 1988).
Cognitive research suggests that errors in delivery could be
reduced by taking advantage of the isolation effect. For
example, memory for destinations would be improved if
location were coded using an alphanumeric code, such as
A21, in which room location is denoted with a letter rather
than a number.
We know that working memory has a limited capacity
(Baddeley, 2000; Miller, 1956), and that the amount and
complexity of information given to a learner also contrib-
utes to cognitive performance (Baddeley, 2000; Sweller,
1988). To determine the extent to which these factors
would likely impact performance on our restaurant task,
we manipulated "load" of to-be-remembered information.
In our "low load" condition, two codes, or delivery assign-
ments, were given to participants, and in the high-load
condition, three codes were given. In all conditions, to
mimic real-world conditions in restaurants, each assign-
ment was compound, involving various specific plates
(e.g., "steak, medium rare") assigned to particular seats. It
was expected that in the high-load relative to low-load
condition, accuracy would decrease. As suggested by
Baddeley and Hitch (1974), because working memory has
a limited capacity, the amount of information given to a
learner likely contributes to cognitive overload. If the von
Restorff effect, and limited working memory capacity,
applies to performance in more realistic situations, the
effect of load should interact with code type in our study,
such that accuracy will be higher in the alphanumeric than
numeric condition but only in the high-load condition.
Knowing whether memory can be enhanced in scenarios
such as these could delineate how cognitive theories and
strategies might be applied to attain expertise in everyday
activities.
Method
Participants
Sixty-six undergraduate students from the University of
Waterloo (UW), with a mean age of 19.98 years (SD = 2.0;
range = 17-35 years), took part in the study. Participants
were recruited from the University's introductory psychol-
ogy course. They received academic credit toward their psy-
chology course for participating.
Design
The study design consisted of one within-participant factor,
load (low vs. high), and two between-participant factors,
order of load (low-load first vs. high-load first), and the form
of code used at encoding of assignment (numeric vs. alpha-
numeric). Performance in relation to these factors was
assessed using each participant's score of correct deliveries
of plates to the specified room, table, and seat (proportion
correct).
Stimulus Material
The computer task was created for this study using
Microsoft's Visual Studio 2008. Participants completed the
task using a laptop computer, headphones, and a mouse. An
overhead view of simulated rooms containing tables was
shown on the computer screen (see Figure 1).
Fernandes et al. 3
Procedure
Briefing.Each participant was instructed that the computer
task involved acting as a "server in a busy restaurant." They
were told to deliver plates to assigned destinations as quickly
and accurately as possible.
Simulated RestaurantTask. On a computer screen, participants
were familiarized with an overhead view of the restaurant
floor plan (Figure 1). The experimenter pointed out the dif-
ferent rooms where plates would be delivered. Each room
had a configuration of tables numbered in sequence. Only
when participants were able to demonstrate their understand-
ing of the layout by describing it back to the experimenter
were they provided with headphones. In this way, we were
able to control for bias on the part of participants who might
simply choose to deliver plates to the closest table possible in
an effort to move quickly through the task.
Depending on the participant's randomly assigned encod-
ing condition, information on the room and table number
was contained either in a numeric code (a three-digit number
such as 324) or an alphanumeric code (a letter and a two-
digit number, for example, A24) that was spoken through the
headphones. The first character in a numeric code was the
number 1, 2, 3, or 4, representing the Patio, Lounge, Atrium,
and Studio, respectively. The first character in the alphanu-
meric code was the letter P, L, A, or S, representing the Patio,
Lounge, Atrium, or Studio, respectively. In both encoding
conditions, the final two characters in the code were digits
representing a table number. Following presentation of the
code, entrée names (plates) with respective seat numbers
were given. An example of a complete serving assignment
given by numeric code is
Table 124; spaghetti, seat 1, hamburger, seat 2, rolled ribs,
seat 3.
An example of an alphanumeric coded assignment is

Table A24; spaghetti, seat 1, hamburger, seat 2, rolled
ribs, seat 3.
As detailed below, participants heard either two (low
load) or three (high load) such assignments on each trial,
with codes either all numeric or all alphanumeric depending
on encoding condition. Presentation of assignments took
approximately 5 to 8 s, depending on the load condition.
After all of the assignments were given, a list of entrée names
for that trial would appear in a textbox in the same order as
presented (simulating the fact that in real life, a server would
be able to see all of the plates arrayed in front of him or her).
Participants were instructed to deliver the plates in the order
they had been assigned, by finding on the computer screen
the correct room and table for each plate, and then clicking
on the appropriate seat. As participants thus delivered plates
to seats, entrée names disappeared from the textbox.
In the low-load condition, two different assignments were
given on each of 20 trials. In the high-load condition, three
such assignments were given on each of 30 trials. In both
load conditions, approximately half of the assignments
involved three entrées (like the examples stated above) and
others involved four entrées (in a mixed ordering).
Specifically, for the low-load condition, there were 9 three-
entrée and 11 four-entrée assignments, and for the high-load
condition, there were 13 three-entrée and 17 four-entrée
assignments. Participants were randomly assigned to receiv-
ing either the low-load or high-load condition first.
Participants were required to achieve an 80% accuracy
level on a set of 10 practice trials before commencing the
experimental trials. Our intent was to minimize "learning
effects" on initial experimental trials.
Results
A 2 × 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA was conducted, with
one within-participant factor, load (low vs. high), and two
between-participant factors, order of load condition and
encoding (numeric vs. alphanumeric). The dependent vari-
able was the percentage of instances in which participants
correctly executed their assignments for placing plates at
particular tables. This score may be considered to be a pro-
portion-correct score, as it was calculated as the total number
of correct seat placements divided by the total number of
assignments given (e.g., 50/71 = 73.2%).
Estimation of the main effect of load yielded the expected
high level of statistical significance, F(1, 62) = 149.00, mean
square error (MSE) = 73.11, p < .001, partial 2 = .71, with
low- and high-load means overall at 77.60 (SD = 13.90) and
59.60 (SD = 18.22), respectively. This reduction in perfor-
mance with high load, relative to low, was evident both with
the alphanumeric encoding, t(32) = 4.87, p < .001, and the
numeric encoding, t(32) = 10.36, p < .001.
Although the main effect of encoding was not statistically
significant overall, F(1, 62) = 1.97, MSE = 418.69, p = .17,
partial 2 = .03, importantly, there was a significant Load ×
Encoding interaction, F(1, 62) = 13.83, MSE = 73.11, p <
.001, partial 2 = .18. Figure 2 shows the study's primary
finding: From the low-load to the high-load condition, per-
formance declined less with the alphanumeric encoding
compared with the numeric encoding.
Secondarily, although the main effect of order did not
yield statistical significance, F(1, 62) = 0.44, MSE = 418.69,
p = .509, partial 2 = .00, this factor did interact with load,
F(1, 62) = 20.94, MSE = 73.11, p < .001, partial 2 = .25.
This interaction appears to reflect a practice effect, inasmuch
as high-load performance was particularly poor when it was
the first condition encountered and low-load performance
was slightly lower when first. Finally, the test of the three-
way interaction of load, order, and encoding was not signifi-
cant, F(1, 62) = 1.14, p = .29, partial 2 = .018, nor did the
test of the remaining interaction, involving the between-sub-
jects variables order and encoding, F(1, 62) = 0.10, p = .92,
partial 2 = .00.
Discussion
Our broad goal in this study was to produce actionable
research by examining whether a well-established effect,
from cognitive psychology, would influence performance on
the practical, everyday task of delivering food orders to
tables as assigned. Knowing whether memory can be
enhanced in scenarios such as these, by taking advantage of
the well-established von Restorff (1933) effect, would extend
current cognitive theories and importantly, suggest strategies
that can be applied to enhance memory in everyday activi-
ties. Given the limited capacity of working memory, we pre-
dicted that if the von Restorff effect applies to performance
in our simulated restaurant environment, the effect of assign-
ment load should interact with code such that accuracy would
be higher in the alphanumeric than numeric condition--
though only in the high-load condition. This is precisely
what was found.

It is possible to argue that the benefit of the alphanumeric
code arose because the letters we selected, P, L, A, and S, are
the first letters of the "room" locations, Patio, Lounge,Atrium,
and Studio, respectively. This correspondence may have con-
ferred a semantic advantage, rather than providing more dis-
tinctiveness, to the alphanumeric code. We favor a
distinctiveness explanation, however, because the restaurant
"servers" were otherwise unfamiliar with the simulated restau-
rant. This unfamiliarity implies that the semantic meaning of
P, L, A, and S was slight, thus minimizing any semantic facili-
tation of memory and performance. What is more, in a pilot
experiment, arbitrary letters (W, X, Y, and Z) were used in the
alphanumeric code instead of letters corresponding to words
(e.g., P signifying the Patio room). Results took the same form
as in the present study, with higher proportion correct in the
alphanumeric than numeric condition--though only in the
high-load condition. The letters used in the procedure were
changed in the current study, in part, because of difficulties
that some participants had in understanding the computer-gen-
erated pronunciations of the pilot study's letters, which limited
our ability to find a statistically significant interaction.
The change to the primary experiment's particular letters
also enhanced the procedure's external validity. In actual res-
taurants, it is difficult to imagine that when management of
that restaurant takes our advice to switch to an alphanumeric
code, that arbitrary letters such as W, X, Y, and Z will be
preferred over P, L, A, and S. Thus, by allowing some poten-
tial "contamination" of the isolation effect, which inspired
this research, from semantic effects, we demonstrated
enhancement of performance by a change in procedure that
restaurants may actually use (and should use, from what we
have observed).
Indeed, a paradox challenges the designer of any applied
experiment: to incorporate the blend of ecological factors
that make up reality, while conducting a tightly controlled
experiment where distinct variables can be manipulated to
draw causal inferences. Given the scope of our research
question, it was impossible to fully satisfy both of these ide-
als in one study. In any event, our study has shown that well-
known effects within the lab can be applied to enhance
everyday performance on memory-related tasks.
The von Restorff effect has been shown in other work to
enhance memory, even in populations known to have mem-
ory difficulties. Bireta, Surprenant, and Neath (2008) showed
that memory performance in a lab setting can be increased in
a population of senior citizens when one item is made dis-
tinct from the other items in a list during encoding (akin to
our alphanumeric vs. numeric code in the current study);
they showed memory for the distinctive item is improved, in
line with the isolation or von Restorff effect. Smith (2011)
recently showed the same pattern of memory benefit in older
adults, when the contrast between an isolated and back-
ground items was increased. There is no reason to suspect
that the benefits to performance documented in the current
study, from employing an encoding strategy that takes
advantage of the isolation effect, would not extend to such
populations. Research in patient populations suggests the
isolation effect is reliant on the integrity of the medial tempo-
ral lobes, and it is only in populations in which this brain
region is compromised, or lesioned, that we fail to see a ben-
efit (Kishiyama, Yonelinas, & Lazzara, 2004). It seems that
encoding strategies that highlight distinctiveness by increas-
ing the contrast between items at encoding, such as using an
alphanumeric compared with numeric code, are a general
means to best organize input to promote enhanced output;
even studies in chimpanzees show a similar isolation effect
on memory (Beran, 2011). In conclusion, our results extend
this line of research by showing that increasing the distinc-
tiveness of delivery assignments in a restaurant-like setting,
by using alphanumeric codes that promote an isolation effect,
can significantly improve memory-related task performance,
particularly when cognitive load is taxed as is often the case
in real-life scenarios.
