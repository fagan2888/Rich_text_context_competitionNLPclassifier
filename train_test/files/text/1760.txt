Herpes simplex virus type 2 seropositivity and
relationship status among U.S. adults age 20
to 49: a population-based analysis
Greta R Bauer*, Nooshin Khobzi, Todd A Coleman
Abstract
Background: U.S. population studies show herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) seroprevalence levelling by
approximately age 30, suggesting few new infections after that age. It is unclear whether this pattern is driven by
greater percentages in stable relationships, and to what extent adults who initiate new relationships may be at risk
of incident HSV-2 infection.
Methods: Survey and laboratory data from the 1999-2008 waves of the U.S. National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) were combined for 12,862 adults age 20-49. Weighted population estimates of self-
reported genital herpes, HSV-2 seroprevalence, and past-year sexual history were calculated, stratified by age, sex,
race, and relationship status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess whether relationship status
provided additional information in predicting HSV-2 over age, race and sex, and whether any such associations
could be accounted for through differences in lifetime number of sex partners.
Results: Those who were unpartnered had higher HSV-2 prevalence than those who were married/cohabitating.
Among unpartnered 45-49 year olds, seroprevalence was 55.3% in women and 25.7% in men. Those who were
married/cohabitating were more likely to have had a past-year sex partner, and less likely to have had two or more
partners. The effect of age in increasing the odds of HSV-2 was modified by race, with higher HSV-2 prevalence
among Black Americans established by age 20-24 years, and the effect of race decreasing from age 30 to 49.
Relationship status remained an independent predictor of HSV-2 when controlling for age, race, and sex among
those age 30 to 49; married/cohabitating status was protective for HSV-2 in this group (OR = 0.69)
Conclusions: Whereas sexually transmitted infections are often perceived as issues for young adults and specific
high-risk groups, the chronic nature of HSV-2 results in accumulation of prevalence with age, especially among
those not in married/cohabitating relationships. Increased odds of HSV-2 with age did not correspond with
increases in self-reported genital herpes, which remained low. Adults who initiate new relationships should be
aware of HSV-2 in order to better recognize its symptoms and prevent transmission.
Background
While most research on sexually transmitted infections
(STIs) has focused on adolescents, young adults, and
established high risk groups, adults outside of these
groups are not free of risk for STIs. The association
between age and STI prevalence varies not only by
population, but by type of infection. As prevalence is a
function of both incidence rate and duration of
infection, prevalence of chronic viral infections such as
genital herpes is cumulative and increases with age,[1-6]
thus possessing special relevance for those beyond the
"young adult" years.
Genital herpes results from infection with herpes sim-
plex virus type 2 (HSV-2), or less commonly type 1
(HSV-1). Since HSV-1 is responsible for most oral out-
breaks or "cold sores" and represents a minority of geni-
tal infections, HSV-2 is used in seroprevalence studies
as a marker of burden of infection with genital herpes.
In the U.S., HSV-2 seroprevalence increased 30% from
1976-80 to 1988-94,[1] and decreased by 19% from

1988-94 to 1999-2004 in those aged 14 to 49 years, with
the strongest decreases among those aged 14 to 19[7].
A number of population-based prevalence studies of
age-related trends in HSV-2 have been conducted, with
age-related patterns varying across populations[8]. In
the U.S., HSV-2 prevalence increased until approxi-
mately age 30, and then stabilized[1]. In Australia, pre-
valence similarly peaked at midlife and then plateaued
[5]. In Ontario, Canada, HSV-2 prevalence did not stabi-
lize but rather continued to increase through the oldest
group studied - 40 to 44 years - a pattern suggesting
additional new infections among middle-aged adults, [2]
and in Puerto Rico prevalence stabilized after age 40[6].
Countries such as Costa Rica and Switzerland have
observed the highest prevalences among the most
elderly,[3,4] though findings of highest prevalence in
elderly men in Switzerland were believed to represent a
World War II cohort effect[4]. Age trends observed in
cross-sectional studies may be due to cohort effects, dif-
ferent rates of infection in different generations. How-
ever, it is likely that an increase in prevalence with age
also represents new infections occurring at older ages.
Slower rates of acquisition of new infections in older
adults vs. young adults as a whole are at least in part
due to the increase in stable long-term relationships
with age. By age 30, approximately 60% of U.S. adults
are married, and this proportion remains relatively
stable in groups up to age 65 (Stevenson, 2007). How-
ever, stable population proportions for marriage do not
necessarily correspond to stable marriages among indivi-
duals. Changes in relationship and family structure have
resulted in increasing proportions of adults finding
themselves outside of long-term monogamous relation-
ships, at least for periods of time. The divorce rate in
the United States rose sharply until 1981 and has
recently levelled off[9]. The marriage rate also decreased
over the past 25 years, and is now at its lowest point in
recorded history, representing new ways to envision
relationships[9]. Cohabitation between unmarried part-
ners has increased ten-fold between 1960 and 2000,
with an 88% increase between 1990 and 2007[10]. Over
the life course, relationship changes due to divorce,
separation or death lead to new patterns of casual dat-
ing, short-term serial monogamy, new long-term rela-
tionships, or remarriage.
While overall HSV-2 prevalence in adults is high, we
hypothesize it may be even higher in the pool of people
from which new partners are typically drawn: those who
are not married or currently cohabitating with a partner.
Thus, for middle-aged and older adults, the probability
of a new partner being infected with a chronic infection
such as HSV-2 may be higher than for other groups,
despite a lower risk of curable STIs, which are of shorter
duration and thus at lower prevalence. Models for
transmission of STIs frequently incorporate individual
behavioural factors, such as rate of partner change and
concurrent partnerships. However, prevalence of infec-
tion in the prospective partner pool alone can result in
widely different outcomes for STI incidence. For exam-
ple, it has been demonstrated that men who have sex
with other men (MSM) would have to be much safer
than heterosexuals in order to stem the HIV epidemic
and that heterosexuals would conversely have to behave
in much riskier ways than MSM to produce a sustained
epidemic[11]. Likewise, African-American youth have
been demonstrated to be at high risk for STIs, even
when engaging in "low-risk" sexual and drug behaviours
[12]. In both of these cases, similar behaviours are
believed to result in very different risks of infection pri-
marily due to the different probabilities of coming into
contact with an infected partner. In general, HSV-2 ser-
opositivity varies by age, race and sex in the U.S. popu-
lation[1,7,8,13,14]. Currently, the prevalence of HSV-2
among unpartnered adults, the group from which new
sex partners would most likely be chosen, is unknown;
exploring this is one aim of the current analysis. The
present study seeks to further explore whether relation-
ship status provides any valuable additional information
beyond these three factors in predicting HSV-2.
Methods
Data
Data were obtained from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES is
a continuous sample survey that uses a complex, multi-
stage, stratified geographic area probability sampling
design for collecting nationally representative data from
the non-institutionalized U.S. population[15]. Cross-sec-
tional data were collected in two-year waves, and data
from five waves between 1999 and 2008 were combined
for this analysis in order to produce large sample sizes
for analysis.
Demographic information, including age, sex, race/
ethnicity, and relationship status, was obtained through
in-home interviews in English or Spanish. More sensi-
tive survey items such as self-reported genital herpes
and sexual history were assessed at a local Mobile
Examination Center (MEC) using audio computer-
assisted self-interview, wherein participants listened to
questions on headphones and input their responses
directly into a computer in a private room, without
interviewer observation. This method has been shown to
result in higher reporting of sensitive behaviours[16,17].
Laboratory specimens for HSV-2 testing were obtained
at the MEC. Sera from respondents aged 14-49 years
were tested for antibody to HSV-2 infection and test
results for those over age 18 were released. Sexual beha-
viour and infection questionnaire data were obtained for

participants 18-59 years; however, only data from those
20 to 59 years of age were released. Our analyses were
thus limited to MEC participants aged 20-49 years. Of
51,623 NHANES participants in the ten-year period
from 1999 to 2008, 13,465 were between the age of 20
and 49, and of these, 12,862 (95.5%) participated in the
MEC exam.
Measures
Relationship status was assessed using the following
categories: never married, married, living with a partner,
divorced, and widowed. For this analysis, those who
were never married, divorced or widowed were grouped
together as "unmarried" to represent the population
most likely to be available for or initiating new sexual
relationships. Those who were married or cohabitating
with a partner were classified as "married/cohabitating"
to represent those unlikely to be initiating new sexual
relationships. Race/ethnicity was measured as Mexican
American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic Black, and other (including multiracial). For
our analyses, Mexican Americans and other Hispanics
were jointly categorized as Hispanic. In the course of
our analysis, and consistent with published literature, we
found differences in HSV-2 seropositivity and in the
unadjusted rate of increase of prevalence with age
between Black respondents and either Hispanic or
White respondents. As no differences were found
between White, Hispanic and "Other" groups, these
were grouped together in analysis for simplicity of pre-
sentation and to increase power to examine interactions
in regression models.
Measures of sexual activity included having any sex in
the past year, and having two or more sex partners in
the past year. Sex was defined as vaginal, anal or oral
sex with a male or female partner. Lifetime number of
sex partners was calculated by summing the total num-
ber of male partners and female partners.
Two measures of genital herpes were used for our
analyses. First, self-reported genital herpes was assessed
with the following questionnaire item: "Has a doctor or
other health care professional ever told you that you
had genital herpes?" Second, laboratory assessment of
HSV-2 was conducted in serum samples using a solid-
phase enzymatic immunodot assay to detect antibodies
reactive to gG-2, a purified glycoprotein specific to
HSV-2; positive immunodot assays were confirmed
using a gG-2 monoclonal antibody inhibition assay[18].
The same assays were used over the 1999-2008 survey
cycles, and in the previous NHANES III[18].
Analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS version
9.2 [19] using SURVEYFREQ and SURVEYLOGISTIC
procedures designed to deal with complex survey data.
Prevalence estimates were derived using 10-year weights
specific to the MEC sample, to represent the U.S. civi-
lian, non-institutionalized population of adults aged
20-49 years, and to account for oversampling and
nonresponse to the interview and medical examinations.
Primary sampling unit, stratum and individual weights
were used to produce weighted point estimates, and var-
iances were calculated using Taylor series linearization.
Frequencies for being unmarried were calculated by
age in five-year intervals. All analyses were stratified
according to age, sex and race. Age-, sex-, race- and
relationship status-specific prevalences for HSV-2 sero-
positivity and self-reported genital herpes were calcu-
lated, along with corresponding 95% confidence
intervals. A similar domain analysis was conducted for
sexual activity variables.
Multivariable unconditional logistic regression was
used to elucidate the strength and combination of
effects on HSV-2 seropositivity as follows. A model was
fit incorporating age, sex, race, and any interactions
between these variables that were statistically significant
(p < 0.05 for Wald chi-square test). Where any interac-
tion was significant, lower-order terms were retained in
the model regardless of level of statistical significance.
Relationship status was then added to the model, to test
whether it contributed anything to predicting HSV-2
seropositivity beyond age, race and sex. Interactions
between relationship status and age, race and sex were
tested, and interaction terms retained where statistically
significant or where marginally significant if effect size
was large. Finally, to test whether any association
between relationship status and HSV-2 seropositivity
may be explained by differences in lifetime number of
sex partners, this variable was entered into the model.
Lifetime sex partner number was coded into five
ordered categories, to allow for a non-linear association
between sex partner number and log odds of HSV-2.
Given that previous analysis of U.S. data had shown
HSV-2 seroprevalence to level off at approximately age
30,[1] and since our primary variable of interest, rela-
tionship status, exhibited an interaction with age, we
conducted a sensitivity analysis to see whether regres-
sion results were heavily influenced by the youngest
adults in our analysis, those aged 20-29 years. A second
logistic regression model was built according to the pro-
cess above, but limited to participants aged 30-49 years.
As this model differed from that containing the full
sample, separate regression models were presented for
those age 20-29 and those age 30-49.
Results
Our analyses included 5,943 males and 6,919 females.
The percentage of Americans who were unpartnered

decreased markedly with increasing age. At age 20-24,
63.3% of women and 73.9% of men remained unmarried
and were not cohabitating with a partner. This propor-
tion decreased sharply through age 29, and by age
45-49, only 29.8% of women and 24.8% of men were
unpartnered. Among unpartnered women, the overall
prevalence of self-reported genital herpes was low (5.8%;
95% CI: 4.5, 7.2) and did not differ significantly from
married/cohabitating women (5.7%; 95% CI: 4.8, 6.6).
However, overall seropositivity for HSV-2 was 32.3%
(95% CI: 29.8, 34.8) for unpartnered women, signifi-
cantly higher than the 22.3% (95% CI: 20.7, 23.9) esti-
mated for married/cohabitating women. Among men,
HSV-2 seroprevalence overall did not differ by relation-
ship status. Overall HSV-2 seroprevalence was 13.6%
(95% CI: 11.8, 15.4) among unpartnered men, and 13.0%
(95% CI: 11.3, 14.7) among married/cohabitating men.
Similarly to women, the prevalence of self-reported gen-
ital herpes was much lower than HSV-2 seroprevalence,
with 2.3% (95% CI: 1.6, 3.0) of unpartnered and 2.3%
(95% CI: 1.6, 3.0) of married/cohabitating men reporting
genital herpes.
Age-, race-, sex-, and relationship status-specific preva-
lences for HSV-2 and self-reported genital herpes are illu-
strated in Figure 1. Specific prevalences and corresponding
95% confidence intervals are reported in Table 1 for HSV-
2 and Table 2 for self-reported genital herpes. Self-
reported prevalences of genital herpes remained low
across all ages, regardless of race, sex, or relationship sta-
tus. At age 45-49, estimates of self-reported genital herpes
ranged from 2.2% among married/cohabitating white/His-
panic/other men to 8.2% among married Black women.
However, the seroprevalence of HSV-2 increased with age,
particularly among unpartnered women, resulting in
increasing discrepancies between self-reported genital
herpes and HSV-2 seropositivity with age. At age 45-49
years, estimated HSV-2 seroprevalences for women were:
61.1% among married Blacks, 70.5% among unpartnered
Blacks, 25.5% among married white/Hispanic/others,
49.9% among unmarried white/Hispanic/others. The cor-
responding prevalences for men were: 48.0%, 42.9%,
14.6%, and 22.0%. While age- and relationship-related pat-
terns for HSV-2 appeared similar across race groups,
Black American men and women had substantially higher
HSV-2 prevalence than those of white, Hispanic or other
racial groups at age 20-24, resulting in higher prevalences
across ages. Disparities in early HSV-2 seroprevalence
were especially marked for Black women, with a preva-
lence of 35.1% (95% CI: 27.5, 42.6) at age 20-24, versus
7.1% (95% CI: 4.8, 9.4) for white, Hispanic or other
women.
Weighted frequencies and corresponding 95% confi-
dence intervals for sexual history variables are presented
in Table 3. Across all groups, married/cohabitating indi-
viduals were more likely to have had sex in the past
year than those who were unpartnered, and unpartnered

sex partners.
Results from multiple logistic regression models pre-
dicting HSV-2 seropositivity among that age 20-29 and
30-49 are presented in Table 4. For 20-29 year olds,
being married or cohabitating was not associated with
HSV-2 seropositivity, controlling for age, race, sex, and
lifetime sex partner number. In contrast, among 30-49
year olds, those who were married or cohabitating had a
statistically significant decreased odds of HSV-2 (OR =
0.69) Within the 30 to 49 year old age stratum, the
association between relationship status and HSV-2 was

ners. In both models, increasing age, Black race, and
female sex were associated with increased odds of HSV-
2 seroprevalence, controlling for lifetime sex partner
number and relationship status, where statistically signif-
icant. However, among those age 30 to 49, age was asso-
ciated with increased seroprevalence of HSV-2 in White,
Hispanic and other-raced people, but not in Blacks, as
the relative impact of Black race decreased with increas-
ing age, corresponding to odds ratios of 6.05 at age 30,
4.20 at age 40, and 3.02 at age 49.
Discussion
Using interview and laboratory data from a large strati-
fied probability sample of the U.S. population, this study
demonstrates high HSV-2 seroprevalence among adults
in general, and disparities in infection prevalences
according to race and relationship status. Relationship
status was found to be an independent predictor of
HSV-2 seroprevalence among adults age 30 to 49, even
when lifetime number of partners was taken into
account, though relationship status no longer had a sig-
nificant effect at ages 20 to 29 once partner number was
included in the model. Our findings indicate that rela-
tionship status provides a moderate amount of addi-
tional information about the risk of having contracted
HSV-2 among U.S. adults. Past the age of 30, the group
from which sex partners are most often drawn - those
not married or living with a partner - has higher odds
of HSV-2 seropositivity than their married/cohabitating
peers, controlling for demographic factors and partner
number. As such, the impact of partnering status should
be considered in future studies of HSV-2 seroprevalence.
Despite strengths related to the size and probability-
based nature of our data set, these analyses have several
data-related limitations. To achieve a large sample size,
we pooled data collected over a ten-year period. Thus,
our analysis assumes that results would be consistent

over this time period. As our estimates combined mar-
ried and cohabitating individuals, proportions with two
or more sex partners in the past year are higher in our
analysis than in U.S. estimates that included only mar-
ried individuals, which estimate that 4.5% of married
men and 3.8% of married women have had multiple
past-year sex partners[20]. While those who were married
or cohabitating were on average less likely to be infected
with HSV-2, we were unable to separate out those who
were monogamous from those who were overtly or cov-
ertly non-monogamous. The measure for multiple part-
nerships covers a one-year period; thus it represents a
combination of concurrent partnerships within marriage
or cohabitation, either due to open relationships or infi-
delity; concurrency before marriage or cohabitation; and
serial partnerships with a partner change during the past
year. We caution against the assumption of lower risk for
a partner who is married or cohabitating, as it is likely
that the non-monogamous subgroup does not share the
same risk profile and HSV-2 prevalence of the monoga-
mous subgroup. Estimated frequencies for having multi-
ple past-year partners were higher for those who were
unpartnered than for those who were married or
cohabitating. The proportion of unpartnered women indi-
cating multiple past-year partners decreased with age,
similar to findings from the 2002 National Survey of
Family Growth[21]. Among men, that decrease was lim-
ited to the white/Hispanic/other group.
HSV-2 seroprevalence and sexual behaviour data were
collected only for those up to age 49 and 59, respec-
tively. Fleming et al. showed consistent and stabilized
HSV-2 seroprevalence among U.S. adults over age 30
using earlier NHANES III data that did not have this
age restriction[1]. Given the heterogeneity within this
group, inclusion of laboratory tests for HSV-2 among
adults over age 49 would have allowed for expansion of
the current analysis into older age ranges. While mis-
conceptions and stereotypes persist, most single indivi-
duals desire to date and continue to be sexually active
as they age[22]. In a U.S. survey of 3501 single indivi-
duals age 40 to 69, 31% were exclusively dating one per-
son and 32% dating more than one person during the
same time period[23]. With an aging baby boomer
population, and the cultural shift brought on by the sex-
ual revolution of the 1960s and -70s, conversations
about middle-aged and older adult sexuality are

becoming more common. Additionally, new treatments
for erectile dysfunction - estimated to affect 20% of
older males [24] - have prolonged sexual functioning.
With this, the U.S. has seen a roughly 87% increase in
prescriptions for erectile dysfunction medications from
1998 to 2001[25]. The cultural reform resulting from
the popularity of the internet has also allowed older
adults to express, experiment and challenge popular
notions of asexuality and sexual disinterest[26]. Thus,
given trends observed up to age 49, and the knowledge
that adults over 50 remain sexually active, it is likely
that genital herpes is a concern for this group as well.
Our analysis found overall HSV-2 rates to stabilize
with age, consistent with results from recent analyses of
1999-2004 NHANES data,[7] and earlier examinations
of NHANES II and NHANES III data[1]. Prevalences
were higher among women than men in our analysis,
and among Black Americans than other races, similar to
findings from other studies[1,7,8,13,14]. However, the
increase in HSV-2 with age was not significantly differ-
ent for Blacks than for other racial groups across the
20-29 year age range, and in fact increased at a slower
rate over ages 30-49. This indicates that disparities in
HSV-2 infection between Black Americans and other
racial groups in the U.S. are driven primarily by high
rates of HSV-2 acquisition at younger ages. By age
20-24, seropositivity had reached 35.1% (95% CI: 27.5,
42.6) and 18.2% (95% CI: 13.1, 23.4) for Black women
and men in our analysis, respectively.
Explanations for disparities in HSV-2 between Black
and other Americans have been varied. While inequal-
ities in access to STI treatment may account for dispari-
ties in bacterial STIs, they are less likely to account for
differences in viral STIs such as HSV-2[27]. Individual
behavioural and socioeconomic factors likely account
for some of the disparity, though these have limited
explanatory power, especially among low-risk Black
Americans. The relative effect of non-Hispanic Black
race/ethnicity has been shown to be strongest among a
low-risk group,[12,13] an effect that was not reduced or
eliminated by adjustment for socio-economic factors
[13]. Even among those having only one lifetime sex
partner, age-adjusted HSV-2 prevalence among Black
men and women has been shown to be 4.4 times that of
whites[1]. Differences in sexual network composition
can produce different STI risks at the same behavioural
risk levels, and such network composition differences
for Black Americans include greater network density,
higher rates of concurrent partnerships, and higher rates
of mixing between core (i.e. high risk) groups and
others[28]. These network patterns may be driven by
social context, including racial segregation, low sex
ratios of men to women, the effects of the crack cocaine
epidemic of the 1980s, and high incarceration rates
among Black U.S. men[28,29]. In our analysis, approxi-
mately twice as many Black men as women reported
having two or more past-year sex partners, even among
those who were married or cohabitating. It has been
suggested that for Black Americans, characteristics of
the partner pool (i.e. mixing) may be more important
than the characteristics of the individual partnership[30].
There is a dearth of information regarding specific
sexual behaviours and protective behaviours in middle-
aged adults. Much of the literature focuses on young
adults and adolescents, though a small but growing
body of literature is developing on older adults. Data
from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
revealed that, among U.S. men and women aged
35 years or older who had sex in the last year, 12.1%
used a condom at last sex[31]. Research on virginity
using National Survey of Family Growth data indicated
that almost 16% of men and almost 13% of women age
40-45 had never engaged in penile-vaginal intercourse,
[32] though many of these would have engaged in other
forms of sexual activity. Of single U.S. adults age 40-69,
22% reported having sexual intercourse consistently
once a week or more and another 37% reported having
had sexual intercourse within the past six months[23]. It
is unknown how many engaged in non-intercourse sex-
ual behaviours that could result in herpes transmission.
Herpes may be transmitted through a wide variety of
behaviours, as viral shedding may occur not only geni-
tally but also orally and on the thighs and buttocks, and
transmission commonly occurs during asymptomatic as
well as symptomatic periods[33].
A substantial difference between HSV-2 seropositivity
and self-reported prevalence was apparent in our analy-
sis, with self-reported genital herpes prevalences remain-
ing low for all groups. Since it is unlikely that this
discrepancy is driven by a greater proportion of asymp-
tomatic cases among older, Black and/or unpartnered U.
S. residents, it may represent either a greater proportion
of undiagnosed cases, a higher reluctance to self-report
among members of these groups, or a lack of access to
health care for certain groups. It may also represent a
lack of recognition of any symptoms as herpetic, as seen
in earlier studies[34]. For all groups, only a minority of
those with HSV-2 acknowledged genital herpes infec-
tion, and most infected individuals were unaware of
their status.
Unfortunately, because middle-age and older adults
fall outside of an already-identified "high risk group" for
STIs - most of which were developed around modes of
transmission for HIV - individuals who are actually "at
risk" fall through the cracks of targeting strategies for
education, diagnosis, and prevention. Once past adoles-
cence and young adulthood, adults are not often consid-
ered as being at significant risk for STIs, and physicians

do not do as thorough a work up in older patients as
they would younger ones[35]. Patients themselves do
not often bring up such issues as they are also unlikely
to perceive themselves at risk of STIs, even where their
behaviour indicates otherwise[36,37]. Moreover, an
HIV-centric focus on penile-vaginal intercourse and
anal intercourse as risky behaviours due to fluid
exchange can obscure assessment of risk for other STIs
where risks associated with sexual practices differ from
HIV. A broad repertoire of sexual or sensual acts that
do not include penile-vaginal or anal intercourse may
still produce risk of transmitting HSV-2.
While HSV-2 does not have the broad effects on mor-
tality and morbidity that HIV does, genital herpes can
lead to adverse psychological and social effects as well
as physical symptoms, and should be taken seriously.
Physically, herpes can be mild or can cause repeated
painful sores that negatively affect daily life activities. It
can also increase the risk of subsequent HIV infection.
For childbearing women herpes infection can impact
delivery, requiring interventions such as caesarean sec-
tion to avoid neonatal infection. A diagnosis with genital
herpes may also cause psychosocial and psychological
distress,[38] including feelings of betrayal, contami-
nation, loss of self-esteem and shame,[39] though the
distress experienced may be short-term[40,41]. Interper-
sonal relationships may be damaged, with the stigma of
herpes diagnosis causing difficulty in disclosing status to
potential sex partners or in seeking care[41]. A lack of
understanding of asymptomatic disease can damage
existing relationships as blame for a newly diagnosed
infection is based on errant assumptions[39]. Moreover,
in a recent meta-analysis of general population cohort
studies, it was found that in areas where HSV-2 is highly
prevalent, infection was associated with a tripling in the
odds of acquiring HIV[42]. Despite these potentially
negative consequences, concerns about psychosocial
burden should not prevent testing for HSV-2 in clinical
practice[43].
This analysis forces us to recognize that a high pro-
portion of adults are seropositive for HSV-2, even a
majority in some groups. Given the commonality of this
STI, and concern that prevalence may be even higher
among some groups of older adults not included in this
study, it may be time to increase our ability to discuss
infection and decrease stigma around genital herpes.
The identification of non-young adults as a group that
is at legitimate risk of HSV-2 could enhance under-
standing that different STIs have differing epidemiologic
profiles. Increased diagnostic suspicion regarding lesions
could also lead to increased diagnosis of HSV-2, and
greater avoidance of sexual contact during symptomatic
periods.
Conclusion
Whereas sexually transmitted infections are often perceived
as issues for young adults and specific high-risk groups, the
chronic, viral nature of HSV-2 results in accumulation of
prevalence with age, especially among those not in married/
cohabitating relationships. The disproportionate burden of
HSV-2 among Black Americans appear to be due to early
incidence by age 20-24, rather than to a more rapid increase
across the 20-49 age range of this study. Increased odds of
HSV-2 with age did not correspond with increases in self-
reported genital herpes, which remained low. Adults who
initiate new relationships thus have a substantial probability
of either coming into contact with a new partner who is
HSV-2 infected, or of having unrecognized HSV-2 infec-
tions themselves. Adults and their physicians should be
aware of HSV-2 in order to better recognize its symptoms,
appropriately treat, and prevent transmission.
