There are many paths to enlightenment.
--Lao Tzu, Chinese Taoist philosopher (600-531 BC)
Long-studied in social psychology, the dangers of prejudice
(Allport, 1954) and the importance of developing tolerance
and respect for others have received attention with an
increased sense of urgency over the past decade. Globally,
although distances are ever-shrinking and differing cultures
must cooperate for survival, terrorist threats and genocidal
wars are part of the daily news. Within the United States,
although population projections suggest that racial and eth-
nic minorities will comprise one third of all Americans by
2015 (Wang et al., 2003) and almost half the population by
the year 2030 (Cortes, 1991), conflicts among racial and eth-
nic groups are responsible for many hate crimes (Wang et al.,
2003). Numerous institutions, from governmental agencies
to educational systems, have noted the need for increasing
tolerance. Institutions of higher learning have, in particular,
declared the importance of facilitating openness to diversity
among students in preparing young adults to become respon-
sible and successful citizens in today's multicultural and
global society (Association of American Colleges and
Universities, 1995; Chickering & Reisser, 1993; Pike & Kuh,
2006; Zúñiga, Williams, & Berger, 2005), able to work with
others from diverse cultures, religions, and ethnicities, both
at home and abroad (Monroe & Martinez-Marti, 2008;
Nelson Laird, Engberg, & Hurtado, 2005).
Tolerance can be conceptualized in many ways, from
merely "putting up with" others who are different, to valuing
and celebrating others' differences (Robinson, Witenberg, &
Sanson, 2001) and research ranges from a focus on reducing
prejudice, to increasing comfort, kinship, and other positive
feelings toward diverse others (Pittinsky, 2009). Many uni-
versity-wide diversity initiatives currently attempt to increase
tolerance, variously defined, through exposure. Contact the-
ory (Allport, 1954) and research findings (Brown &
Hewstone, 2005; Dovidio, Gaertner, & Kawakami, 2003)
support the desirable impact of positive intergroup encoun-
ters on intergroup harmony. Accordingly, many universities
have increased the presence of minority students on campus

The Importance of Identity Development,
Principled Moral Reasoning, and Empathy
as Predictors of Openness to Diversity in
Emerging Adults
Marylie W. Gerson1 and Leanne Neilson1
Abstract
Programs that attempt to increase tolerance and openness to diverse cultures, religions, and ethnicities through education
and exposure are popular and often successful in higher education, but at times backfire, leading instead to an increase in
prejudice. The present study considered several intrapersonal and developmental factors that may be important to consider.
Identity development (Measures of Psychosocial Development, based on Erikson's theory of psychosocial development),
moral reasoning (Defining Issues Test, based on Kohlberg's theory of moral development), and empathy (a subscale of the
California Personality Inventory) were tested as predictors of openness to diversity (Miville-Guzman Universality-Diversity
Scale) with entering first-year university students (n = 282) at a small, private comprehensive university. As hypothesized,
identity development, principled moral reasoning, and empathy each significantly and positively predicted openness to
diversity, and the combination of predictors accounted for a moderately large portion of the criterion's variance. Implications
are discussed for developing effective programs to facilitate openness to diversity in emerging adulthood.

(Chang, Denson, Sáenz, & Misa, 2003) and planned oppor-
tunities for intergroup contact (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2000) and
courses or workshops on multiculturalism and minority
issues (Adams & Zhou-McGovern, 1994; McCauley, Wright,
& Harris, 2000), and numerous studies support the positive
impact of such programs on attitudes toward minorities
(Boisjoly, Duncan, Kremer, Levy, & Eccles, 2006; Hogan &
Mallott, 2005; Janmat, 2012; Luo & Jamieson-Drake, 2009;
Tadmor, Hong, Chao, Wiruchnipawan, & Wang, 2012;
Umbach & Kuh, 2006).
The effects of increasing exposure to diversity can be
complex (Costandius & Rosochacki, 2012) and mixed
(Jones, 1994; Killen & Smetana, 2010; Thijs & Verkuyten,
2013), however, and exposure "may sow the seeds of conflict
or compassion" (Jones, 1994, p. 39), depending on the condi-
tions in which it occurs. Positive consequences can include
increasing empathy, perspective-taking, tolerance, and the
celebration of various cultural traditions; but at times, preju-
dice and discrimination increase instead. A report prepared
by the State Higher Education Executive Officers (1987)
cautioned that, while lack of cross-cultural contacts can be
detrimental, contacts can also be damaging if participants
begin the interactions with prejudice or ignorance. As noted
by Taylor (1994), "engendering tolerance is not simply a
question of demographics--gathering a diverse group of
people together--but is dependent on the quality of that
experience" (p. 32). Multicultural campus programs may
increase ethnic identity (Simmons, Wittig, & Grant, 2010)
and, although feeling a strong connection to one's own group
does not necessarily lead to a hatred of nonmembers (Brewer,
1999), negative intergroup attitudes have been found at times
to increase as a result (Verkuyten, 2008). Although there is
considerable evidence that diversity initiatives can foster
cultural knowledge and interracial understanding among col-
lege students, some attempts at increasing openness to diver-
sity solely through education and discourse can have
unfavorable results (McCauley et al., 2000; Wood &
Sherman, 2001).
A number of conditions have been posited by contact the-
ory (Allport, 1954) to be important for favorable conse-
quences, including adequate opportunity for the members to
get to know each other, similarity in status, a cooperative
situation, support by the institution and those in authority,
and friendship (Cook, 1978; Pettigrew, 1998). Meaningful,
positive relationships with peers from other groups may be
relevant in that they both build positive feelings and reduce
uncertainty and anxiety about interacting with diverse others.
They may also promote perspective-taking and empathy.
Even when the conditions noted are met, however, a meta-
analysis of studies on children and adolescents in school set-
tings indicated that intergroup contact accounts for only a
medium-sized effect on negative ethnic attitudes (Tropp &
Prenevost, 2008). In a review of the evidence for positive
and negative consequences of interethnic contact in schools,
Thijs and Verkuyten (2013) called for a consideration of
individual characteristics and social and psychological pro-
cesses as important predictors of tolerance.
In fact, research on a number of intrapersonal variables is
pertinent to understanding the development of tolerance. As
argued by Witenberg (2007), tolerance may be best concep-
tualized, not as the absence or control of prejudice, but as
something related to morality, with concerns for justice,
equality, and fairness. Examining the reasoning used by chil-
dren and adolescents for their tolerant or intolerant attitudes
in response to dilemmas portraying prejudicial behaviors,
Witenberg found moral considerations of fairness as well as
empathy for the plight of the target of prejudice to underlie
most participants' tolerant attitudes. She also found that an
individual's degree of tolerance and underlying reasoning
tended to be cross-situational, wherein some individuals
were tolerant irrespective of the circumstances described,
reflecting an enduring intrapersonal attribute. Furthermore,
tolerance, morality, prosociality, and aspects of identity
development may be linked in their shared quest for under-
standing what factors allow people to move away from pro-
tecting only their self-interests and toward a perspective that
may include or benefit others or society. The extensive litera-
ture on prosocial behavior and morality also points to the
roles of both cognitive (Davis et al., 2004; Kohlberg, 1976;
Rest, Narvaez, Thoma, & Bebeau, 2000) and affective
domains (Batson, Chang, Orr, & Rowland, 2002; de
Vignemont & Singer, 2006; Eisenberg, Shea, Carlo, &
Knight, 1991; Hoffman, 2001). Issues related to identity
have received attention as well (Blasi, 2005; Perugini &
Leone, 2009), and many researchers have argued that a com-
bination of factors must be considered (Frimer & Walker,
2008; Smetana & Killen, 2008).
The process of teaching intercultural sensitivity to college
students is a complex challenge, which some have also noted
should include a consideration of developmental issues
(Mahoney & Schamber, 2004). For example, some social
justice and diversity courses in college curricula require a
certain level of developmental maturity, including critical
thinking and self-reflective abilities, openness to conflicting
perspectives, and perspective-taking (Adams, 2002). King
and Baxter Magolda (2005) have argued that intercultural
maturity in the college years should be understood as a
developmental process and research supports the importance
of maturity in promoting openness among college students to
exposure to diversity (Kubal, Stone, Meyler, & Mauney,
2003). With emerging adulthood, comes the potential for a
number of developmental strides, including new cognitive
abilities (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958), corresponding advances
in moral reasoning (Gibbs, Moshman, Berkowitz, Basinger,
& Grime, 2009; Kohlberg, 1976; Rest et al., 2000), and an
integrated sense of identity (Erikson, 1959, 1968). The pro-
cess of facilitating positive growth in emerging adults is
complex (Pike & Kuh, 2006); emerging adulthood, with its
new-found potentials for maturity, may be, in fact, a particu-
larly fruitful time to facilitate the acceptance of others.
Gerson and Neilson 3
In considering the potential roles of both cognitive and
affective variables relevant to openness to others in emerging
adulthood, two developmental theories are particularly perti-
nent: Erikson's psychosocial theory of identity development
and Kohlberg's theory of moral reasoning. Accordingly, the
present study focused on both identity development and the
development of moral reasoning as understood by these the-
ories. The role of empathy, as possibly "the most prototypi-
cal moral emotion and . . . certainly the most widely
discussed" (Pizarro, 2000, p. 355), was also addressed. These
three factors were also selected to represent both cognitive
and affective domains, so that we could test the relevance of
a variety of intrapersonal areas.
Identity Development
Identity has been considered from a number of perspectives
(Craig-Bray, Adams, & Dobson, 1988; Hill, Allemand, &
Burrow, 2010; Loevinger, 1998), but Erikson's (1959, 1968)
psychosocial theory of identity development may be espe-
cially applicable to understanding a new potential for open-
ness to diversity during emerging adulthood. According to
Erikson's theory, identity development is an epigenetic pro-
cess wherein specific issues tend to be addressed and resolved
in a predictable order across the life span. A progression
through childhood stages, of trust versus mistrust, autonomy
versus shame and doubt, initiative versus guilt, and industry
versus inferiority, culminate, in adolescence, in a crisis
involving identity versus ego confusion. Each of Erikson's
stages of identity development can be seen as relevant to the
evolution of tolerance and openness to diversity, but the suc-
cessful resolution of identity in adolescence would seem to
be especially pertinent. Erikson (1959) noted that, before a
sense of identity is adequately established, adolescents
become remarkably clannish, intolerant, and cruel in their
exclusion of others who are "different," in skin color or cultural
background, in tastes and gifts, and often in entirely petty
aspects of dress and gesture arbitrarily selected as the signs of an
in-grouper or out-grouper. (p. 97)
According to Erikson,
It is important to understand . . . such intolerance as the necessary
defense against a sense of identity confusion . . . It is difficult to
be tolerant if deep down you are not quite sure . . . that you really
know who you are. (pp. 97-98)
and without a positive resolution of this stage, one is left with
" . . . distantiation: the readiness to repudiate, to isolate, and,
if necessary, to destroy those forces and people whose
essence seems dangerous to one's own . . . " (p. 101). Erikson
continued, "This . . . repudiation is an outgrowth of the
blinder prejudices which during the struggle for an identity
differentiate sharply and cruelly between the familiar and the
foreign" (pp. 101-102).
Not all who tolerate or even embrace diversity in others
do so because of a mature identity. For example, some ado-
lescents may gravitate toward "all that is different" as they
explore various aspects of themselves or as a means of rebel-
ling against the status quo. It can also be argued that being
indiscriminantly accepting of others' values may not be
desirable (Shady & Larson, 2010). Being open to a respectful
dialogue and serious consideration of diverse perspectives
may be facilitated by feeling secure in oneself, however. We
reasoned that successful resolution of the adolescent identity
crisis may facilitate the young adult's ability to tolerate oth-
ers' differences and foster the security helpful for under-
standing and appreciating others' perspectives, feelings, or
needs.
Principled Moral Reasoning
Much research has been rooted in Kohlberg's developmen-
tal theory of moral reasoning (Haggbloom et al., 2002).
Extending Piaget's work on morality, Kohlberg's theory
(Kohlberg & Kramer, 1969) posits that increasingly sophis-
ticated moral structures may emerge as developing cogni-
tive capabilities interact with one's social and cultural
environment. Although some have questioned the continued
validity of this theory (Lapsley & Hill, 2008) and conceptu-
alizations of prosociality and morality involve heated debate
(Frimer & Walker, 2008), recognition of the utility of the
Kohlbergian approach (Boom, Wouters, & Keller, 2007) and
the importance of considering developmental issues in
research on moral functioning (Gibbs et al., 2009)
continues.
The neo-Kohlbergian approach of Rest and colleagues
(2000) is well suited to studying a level of moral reasoning
that, developmentally, first becomes possible shortly before
emerging adulthood. This approach describes moral sche-
mas, with development seen as involving shifting distribu-
tions of less and more mature types of moral reasoning. The
three main schemas--Personal Interest, Maintaining Norms,
and Postconventional--are seen as increasingly mature
ways of answering "the "macro" question (of) . . . how to get
along with people who are not friends, kin or personal
acquaintances, i.e. how to organize society-wide co-
operation" (Rest et al., 2000, p. 386). Adolescence brings a
major social-cognitive advance that allows for reasoning
beyond a Personal Interest approach and toward a sociocen-
tric perspective. The Maintaining Norms schema involves
appeals to a moral consensus that are based on established
practice and existing authority, whereas the Postconventional
schema is principled, viewing moral obligations as based on
shared ideals, as reciprocal, and as open to scrutiny, debate,
and tests of logical consistency. Principled moral reasoning
may best reflect a perspective that involves moving away
from one's own self-interest and toward one that reflects
concerns with fairness, social justice, equality, and openness
to diversity.

Empathy
Eisenberg and her colleagues have extensively studied the
relationship between empathy and prosocial behaviors and
intentions, noting that "other-oriented cognitions and emo-
tions may foster prosocial moral judgment and vice versa"
(Eisenberg et al., 2002, p. 1004). As asserted by Eisenberg
and Eggum (2008), "altruists see strangers as fellow human
beings" and "the cultivation of sympathy--especially for
individuals who . . . may differ in ethnicity, race, nationality,
or other ways--is critical for enhancing cooperation and
altruistic behavior" (p. 69). Batson, Early, and Salvarani
(1997) also noted that once empathic feelings are aroused,
they have some "inertia," allowing for positive feelings to
generalize to a stigmatized group as a whole and numerous
other studies have found various aspects of empathy to pre-
dict prosocial behavior (Batson et al., 2003; Eisenberg,
Fabes, & Spinrad, 2006; Malti, Gummerum, Keller, &
Buchmann, 2009; Van Lange, 2008).
The Present Study
College students are exposed to experiences with ethnicities,
religions, political views, values, and lifestyles that differ
from their own. Consistent with Erikson's psychosocial the-
ory of identity development, we predicted that resolution of
the adolescent crisis involving identity and ego confusion
would significantly predict openness to diversity (Hypothesis
1). In accordance with research on prosociality and moral
reasoning, we predicted that principled moral reasoning
(Hypothesis 2), and empathy (Hypothesis 3) and would also
be significant predictors.
Method
Instruments
Sample demographics.
The Background Questionnaire
assessed participants' age, gender, and ethnicity.
Openness to diversity. We chose to assess tolerance as defined
positively, to reflect an interest in diverse others. As college
students are typically exposed to others who differ in many
ways, including ethnicity, abilities, and sexual orientation,
we also selected an instrument that tapped diversity as
broadly defined.
Openness to diversity was assessed by the total score on
the Miville-Guzman Universality-Diversity Scale
(M-GUDS). The M-GUDS was developed by Miville et al.
(1999) to measure a universal-diverse orientation (UDO).
Questions address attitudes regarding a variety of potential
human differences, including age, gender, race, abilities, and
sexual orientation, and assess the degree to which there is a
recognition and acceptance of similarities and differences,
both past and intended interpersonal contact with diverse
others, and an emotional bond felt toward others.
The instrument consists of 45 items, rated on 6-point
scales (from 1 = strongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree).
Positive and negative phrasings are present to avoid a
response bias; negative items are reverse-scored, and a
higher score indicates higher levels of UDO.
Five judges were involved in item development and
assessment and a number of studies have assessed the instru-
ment's validity and reliability. In a series of four studies,
Miville et al. (1999) found internal consistency to range from
.89 to .94 and test­retest reliability for the measure at 1 to 2
weeks to be high (r = .94). Means ranged from 169.89 to
203.03 and standard deviations ranged from 23.62 to 31.27.
Means and standard deviations for the present study fell
within these ranges (M = 187.70, SD = 25.08).
When tested with predominantly Caucasian samples
(comparable with the present sample), construct validity for
the M-GUDS was supported by significant and positive cor-
relations with other measures of openness to others, includ-
ing the Perspective Taking and Empathic Concern subscales
of Davis's (1980) Interpersonal Reactivity Index, the
Autonomy scale of Helms's (1990) White Racial Identity
Attitude Scale, Fassinger's (1994) Attitudes Toward
Feminism and the Women's Movement Scale, as well as with
Androgyny and Femininity scores on the Bem Sex-Role
Inventory (Bem, 1974). Also as predicted by its developers,
the M-GUDS correlated significantly and positively with
several measures of psychological health developed by
Luhtanen and Crocker (1992) and Slyter (1989) and nega-
tively with both Troldahl and Powell's (1965) Dogmatism
Scale and Hansen's (1982) Homophobia Scale. Discriminant
validity was supported by low, non-significant correlations
with SAT Verbal scores, the Fantasy and Personal Distress
scales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, and Crowne and
Marlowe's (1964) Social Desirability Scale.
Identity development. Identity development was assessed by
the Measures of Psychosocial Development (MPD). Hawley
(1988) developed this self-report instrument to assess the
degree to which each of Erikson's eight stages of psychoso-
cial development has been resolved. It consists of 112 Likert-
type 5-point scales (from 1 = not at all like you to 5 = very
much like you) about feelings, experiences, and self-
concepts. Each stage is represented by seven positive (e.g.,
willing to give and take in my relationships) and seven nega-
tive (e.g., avoid commitment to others) statements, allowing
for the computation of positive, negative, and resolution
(positive minus negative) scores for each stage.
Hawley (1988) found test­retest reliability coefficients to
range from .67 to .91 for intervals from 2 to 13 weeks and
Cronbach's alpha coefficients to range from .65 to .84. The
MPD correlated positively with corresponding traits on two
other measures of Erikson's theory: Constantinople's (1969)
Inventory of Psychosocial Development (correlations = .46-
.78) and Boyd's (1966) Self-Description Questionnaire (cor-
relations = .28-.65), supporting its construct validity.
Gerson and Neilson 5
Identity was assessed in the present study by subtracting
the subscore for adolescent ego confusion (i.e., experiencing
difficulty in integrating a central identity) from the subscore
for identity (i.e., knowing who one is, where one is going,
and what one's goals and values are). Hawley (1988) reported
a mean of 7.11 (SD = 8.41) for a normative sample of 18- to
24-year-old men and a mean of 8.44 (SD = 8.60) for a norma-
tive sample of women. Means and standard deviations were
comparable in the present study (M = 7.48, SD = 8.53).
Moral reasoning. The Defining Issues Test (DIT) was devel-
oped by Rest and colleagues (Rest, 1993; Rest & Narvaez,
1998) to assess moral reasoning. Based on Kohlberg's theory
of moral development, the DIT is conceptualized as a device
for activating moral schemas (Rest et al., 2000). Participants
read six moral dilemmas and respond to a series of issue
statements which provide fragments of lines of reasoning.
Items that both make sense to the participant and activate a
preferred schema receive a high rating and rank. Scores rep-
resent percentages of the relative importance that a partici-
pant gives to each of three modes of reasoning: Personal
Interest, Maintaining Norms, and Postconventional (princi-
pled) schemas (Rest et al., 2000). Data that do not pass five
reliability checks are purged.
Over 400 published articles support the test's construct
validity and reliability (Rest, Narvaez, Thoma, & Bebeau,
1999). According to Rest et al. (2000), scores significantly
correlate with moral education interventions, many prosocial
behaviors, desired aspects of professional decision making,
controversial public policy and political attitudes, education
post junior high school, age, and numerous cognitive mea-
sures. Rest et al. reported that the DIT is equally valid for
males and females, and that DIT scores predict seven validity
criteria, above and beyond variance accounted for by scores
of verbal ability/general intelligence or political attitude.
Cronbach's alpha and test­retest reliability scores range
from the upper .70s to the lower .80s.
The P score is most often used to reflect a principled orien-
tation, generally averaging in the 30s for senior high students
and 40s for college students (Rest, 1993). The mean score fell
within this range in the present study (M = 33.34, SD = 16.53)
and was used for assessing principled reasoning.
Empathy.The California Personality Inventory (CPI) is a
462-item, self-report inventory, which consists of 20 "folk
scales." These scales were developed "to assess the kind of
everyday variables that ordinary people use in their daily
lives to understand, classify, and predict their own behavior
and that of others" (Gough, 1987, p. 1).
In the present study, empathy was assessed by the inven-
tory's Empathy Scale. The scale is composed of 38 true/false
statements, measuring the extent to which an individual
understands the feelings of others. According to its devel-
oper, Gough (1987), a high-scorer would be "comfortable
with self and well-accepted by others" (p. 6) and would
understand others' feelings, whereas a low-scorer would be
"ill at ease in many situations; unempathic" (p. 6). A study
with college students indicated internal consistency for the
scale to be .58, and test­retest measures on high school stu-
dents ranged from .56 to .58 (Gough, 1987). Raw scores may
be converted to standard scores.Ascore of 21 on the Empathy
Scale is at approximately the 50th percentile for both men
and women. The mean for the present study was very close
to 21 (M = 21.79, SD = 4.58).
Participants
Participants initially consisted of 282 entering first-year stu-
dents (84% of the class) at a small, private university in
southern California. No potential participants were purpose-
fully excluded from the sample. All participants were at least
18 years of age and ranged from 18.02 to 24.17 (M = 18.57,
SD = .53). Males (48.6% of the sample) and females (51.4%)
were approximately equally represented. The sample was
predominantly Caucasian (74.5%), followed by Mixed Race
(12.8%), Hispanic/Latino (6.4%), Asian (2.8%), Native
American (0.7%), African American (0.4%), or Other (2.5%)
ethnicities. Two outliers (scoring over 3 SDs from the M)
were omitted from the data: One male scored very low on
openness to diversity and one male scored very low on iden-
tity. Data were analyzed for the resulting 280 cases.
Procedure
The study was approved by the university's Institutional
Review Board (IRB), and the American Psychological
Association's (2002) ethical guidelines for research with
human participants were followed throughout the process.
Before beginning the study, all participants signed an
informed consent form detailing the procedure and notifying
them of their rights as participants. The consent form
explained that their participation would assist in a research
project on the thinking processes and attitudes of the fresh-
man class. They were informed that questionnaire packets
were coded by identification numbers linked to their names
for a voluntary follow-up study to be offered in the future.
Participants were assured that all personal information would
be kept confidential and that participation was entirely vol-
untary. All identifiers, as well as informed consent forms,
were separated from the questionnaires and secured in locked
files accessible only to the researchers. Participants were
given contact phone numbers and email addresses of the
researchers to obtain a summary of the findings and to
address any questions or concerns.
University students completed the packet of question-
naires during their first-year orientation, 2 days prior to the
start of the fall semester. Packets were completed simultane-
ously in quiet classrooms, in groups of approximately 20.
The order of questionnaires in packets was counterbalanced
and administration took approximately 1½ hr.

Results
An alpha level of .05 was adopted for all statistical tests.
Primary statistical analyses were conducted using the
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 20.0 (SPSS 20.0,
professional package). One-tailed Pearson correlations were
used only for hypothesis tests; otherwise, two-tailed tests
were used. Size of effect was assessed by R2 for multiple
regressions and cutoffs recommended by Cohen (1992) were
applied for interpreting squared values of r (.01 for small, .09
for medium, and .25 for large). All scores were approxi-
mately normally distributed.
Hypothesis Tests
As predicted, openness to diversity correlated positively and
significantly with identity, r(280) = .20, p < .001, principled
reasoning, r(261) = .16, p = .005, and empathy, r(280) = .33,
p < .001. In addition, it did not correlate positively with
stages of non-principled moral reasoning and a two-tailed
test revealed that it correlated negatively and significantly
with stages of moral reasoning that reflect a personal interest
orientation, r(261) = -.17, p = .007.
The three predictors were tested in a stepwise multiple
linear regression analysis, with PIN (minimum probability of
F that a variable can have to enter the analysis) set at 0.050
and POUT (maximum probability of F that a variable can
have and not be removed from the model) at 0.051. In all
cases, Tolerance was at least .91 and variance inflation factor
(VIF) was no greater than 1.10, satisfying possible collinear-
ity concerns. Empathy significantly predicted openness to
diversity, R2 = .11, F(1, 259) = 32.31, p < .001, B = 1.81,  =
.33, 95% CI
B
= [1.18, 2.44], and identity significantly added
to this prediction, R2 = .02, F(1, 258) = 5.50, p = .02, B =
0.41,  = .14, 95% CI
B
= [0.07, 0.75], as did principled rea-
soning, R2 = .02, F(1, 257) = 5.54, p = .02, B = 0.21,  =
.14, 95% CI

= [0.03, 0.38]. Together, the three variables
accounted for a moderately large proportion of the variance
of the criterion, R2 = .15. Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3 were
supported.
Other predictors of openness to diversity.We examined the
relationship between resolution of each of Erikson's first six
stages of psychosocial development and openness to diver-
sity. Theoretically, Stages 7 and 8 would not yet apply to
emerging adults and so were not included in the analyses.
Openness to diversity correlated positively and significantly
with resolution of every stage: trust versus mistrust, r(280) =
.25, p < .001; autonomy versus shame and doubt, r(280) =
.19, p = .002; initiative versus guilt, r(280) = .14, p = .016;
industry versus inferiority, r(280) = .24, p < .001; and inti-
macy versus isolation, r(280) = .28, p < .001. When resolu-
tion scores for the first six stages were entered into a stepwise
multiple linear regression analysis, openness to diversity was
best predicted by resolution of intimacy versus isolation,
R2 = .08, F(1, 278) = 23.99, p < .001, B = 0.81,  = .28, 95%
CI
B
= [0.48, 1.13], and resolution of industry versus inferior-
ity significantly added to this prediction, R2 = .01, F(1,
277) = 4.41, p = .04, B = 0.48,  = .14, 95% CI
B
= [0.03,
0.93]. Together, they accounted for a moderate proportion of
the variance, R2 = .09. Values for Tolerance (at least .78) and
VIF (no greater than 1.28) were again well within acceptable
ranges.
Discussion, Limitations, and Conclusion
Our Findings and Implications for Future
Research
As hypothesized, identity development, principled moral
reasoning, and empathy each predicted openness to diversity.
Consistent with previous research, empathy was a particu-
larly strong predictor. These findings confirm that intraper-
sonal variables predict openness to diversity. They also
confirm the importance of considering cognitive, affective,
and developmental variables in predicting openness to diver-
sity for emerging adults.
We had predicted that resolution of the adolescent identity
crisis would be particularly important for facilitating open-
ness to diversity. Exploratory analyses found that resolution
of the next stage, intimacy versus isolation, was an even
stronger predictor, especially in combination with the earlier
stage of industry versus inferiority. Both stages of intimacy
versus isolation and industry versus inferiority are interest-
ing, as the first involves issues related to connecting with
another person and the second, confidence in one's own
competence relative to peers. Erikson (1959) posited resolv-
ing identity versus ego confusion to be important for the
strength not to engage in "distantiation" and intolerance of
diverse others. Interestingly, a recent study (Tadmor et al.,
2012) demonstrated that a cognitive need for closure predicts
stereotype endorsement, racism, and discrimination.
Although their study was based on a very different theoreti-
cal framework from that of the present study, individuals in
the throes of ego confusion might be expected to have a need
to protect themselves from the "threat" of diverse others. Our
finding for the relative importance of the next stage of devel-
opment may in fact reflect how we operationalized tolerance.
Rather than assessing the absence of prejudice or intoler-
ance, our instrument (M-GUDS) measured a positive attitude
of interest in exploring diversity--a characteristic which
may involve issues related more to intimacy and in being
open to linking with others. Promoting a positive interest in
others may support an appreciation for diversity. Future
research should explore whether the mere absence of intoler-
ance involves different intrapersonal mechanisms than does
embracing diversity.
Regarding the stage of industry versus inferiority, Erikson
(1959) wrote, "this is socially a most decisive stage: since
industry involves doing things beside and with others, a first
Gerson and Neilson 7
sense of division of labor and of equality of opportunity
develops at this time" (p. 93). It is also the first stage in which
the child's significant relations move beyond the basic fam-
ily, to include neighborhood and school (Erikson, 1959), pre-
sumably with new-found opportunities for exposure to
diversity. It makes sense that successfully resolving issues
related to working side-by-side with others outside the fam-
ily would be conducive to openness to diversity. Further
research could explore the role of childhood experiences, as
well as ways to promote a sense of competence and develop-
mental readiness to connect intimately with others.
Principled moral reasoning was found to be a significant
predictor of openness to diversity and non-principled moral
reasoning was not. This is also an interesting finding given
how we operationalized tolerance. Other studies (Witenberg,
2007) have found moral reasoning to be important in reac-
tions to descriptions of another's prejudicial behaviors--sit-
uations which may more clearly be tied to issues of justice,
equality, and fairness. We found moral reasoning to be a sig-
nificant factor in embracing differences as well, although the
effect size for the variable was small. It may be worthwhile
to study whether its strength as a predictor depends on how
tolerance is operationalized. As noted by Witenberg (2007),
understanding its role, as well as how moral reasoning pro-
gresses developmentally, may have important implications
for curriculum design and social policy.
Finally, empathy was found in our study to be the stron-
gest predictor of openness to diversity. This finding is consis-
tent with previous research linking empathy with both the
reduction of prejudice and the presence of prosocial behavior
(Batson et al., 2003; Eisenberg et al., 2006; Malti et al., 2009;
Van Lange, 2008), and suggests that empathy may be related
to an overall interest in being with and understanding other
people. Empathy may foster an identification with another
person in an emotionally significant way. Further research
could explore how far-reaching the effects of empathy may
be.
Not only may multiple factors be involved in openness to
diversity, there may be individual differences regarding
which factors predominate as well. In a person-level analysis
of moral exemplars, for example, Walker, Frimer, and
Dunlop (2010) found that exemplary moral functioning can
arise from different sources across individuals. Specifically,
they found three "clusters" of moral exemplars: some heroes
were strong in relational and generative motives, some were
strong in sophisticated moral reasoning and self-develop-
ment, and others were quite "ordinary," differing little from
non-heroes. Accordingly, it may be productive to explore
whether behaviors are motivated by heterogeneous factors,
as opposed to universally resulting from a particular charac-
teristic or combination of variables. Consistent with findings
of Walker et al. (2010) for multiple possible motives for her-
oism, predictors may vary for individuals, subgroups, and
situations. The sample size of the present study prohibited
reliable cluster analyses to identify possible distinct
pathways, but an informal review of the data revealed that a
relatively high score on no single predictor was a necessary
prerequisite for a relatively high score on openness to diver-
sity. Future research may consider exploring large samples
using a cluster analytic approach. Better questions than
which variable is most important may be for whom are par-
ticular variables important and/or most efficiently strength-
ened, as well as what additional variables should be
considered. Finding a single "key" to increasing openness to
diversity may not be as effective as designing programs that
address multiple factors and/or are tailored to individual
needs.
Finally, it may be worthwhile to consider how these intra-
personal factors can be developed. As noted by Butrus and
Witenberg (2013), "There is a consensus that pro-social atti-
tudes and behaviours of empathy, sympathy, compassion,
and caring, which form the basis of tolerance, can be taught
and learned" (p. 297). There is also some evidence for bi-
directionality among some of these variables and exposure to
multicultural experiences. Tadmor et al. (2012) found that
exposure to multicultural experiences may be helpful in that
they may lead to a reduction in cognitive rigidity, thereby
reducing intolerance. They conceptualized this growth in
terms of responses to the cognitive disequilibrium and
repeated experiences with dissonance which led individuals
to become "epistemically unfrozen" (p. 753). Experience
may be helpful by what it teaches a person about others, by
resulting cognitive changes, and/or by changes in feelings
toward others. The interplay among multicultural experi-
ences, identity development, moral development, empathy,
and other factors may be bi-directional. Developmental read-
iness may be important to consider, however, to minimize
the chances of destructive outcomes.
Limitations of the Study
Anumber of limitations are important to address. We selected
only three factors to explore as potential predictors of open-
ness to diversity. Our intent was not to address all relevant
factors, but rather to demonstrate that developmental factors
may be important to address, as well as both cognitive and
affective domains. Other factors are also undoubtedly influ-
ential, including such intrapersonal or interpersonal variables
as past and current experiences with diverse others, family
attitudes (Castelli, Zogmaister, & Tomelleri, 2009; Stringer
et al., 2010; White & Gleitzman, 2006), or even issues related
to temperament (Davis, Luce, & Kraus, 1994). Eisenberg
and colleagues (Eisenberg & Eggum, 2008), for example,
have found that level of personal distress may impair one's
ability to be empathic toward others.
Each of our factors could also be assessed by other mea-
sures. Our instruments relied on self-report, which can give
valuable information about feelings, attitudes, and experi-
ences, but are limited to information about which a partici-
pant is both aware and willing to share. We believe that our
8 SAGE Open
measure of openness to diversity is particularly rich in that it
taps attitudes regarding multiple aspects of diversity, feelings
toward diverse others, and both past and intended behavioral
contact. Sound alternatives exist for measuring our con-
structs, however, and findings should eventually be tested
with direct behavioral measures. Distinctions between lack
of intolerance and positive intergroup attitudes should also
be explored (Pittinsky, 2009).
It should also be noted that our sample was limited to
undergraduates entering a small, private university in south-
ern California. We were able to include most of our entering
first-year students; however, our students may have differed
from other emerging adults in the general population or even
at other universities. Further research is needed to confirm
our findings with other samples. Furthermore, a larger sam-
ple would allow for cluster analyses to explore the possibility
of multiple pathways to openness to diversity.
Conclusion
We found evidence for the relevance of a developmental
approach, as well as for a number of specific intrapersonal
variables which included both cognitive and affective fac-
tors. Identity development, principled moral reasoning, and
empathy each significantly predicted openness to diversity in
our sample of emerging adults. Continuing to define specific
situational features that support and elicit desired behaviors
remains important future work--both exposure and educa-
tion have been found to be effective in building acceptance
of diverse cultures, religions, and ethnicities. Including a
consideration of developmental and intrapersonal variables
may be important as well, however, both for increasing the
effectiveness of such programs and for reducing the likeli-
hood of adverse effects. In fact, it may be fruitful to explore
ways in which intrapersonal variables and situational factors
may benefit each other in a bi-directional way or even inter-
act, to maximize the effectiveness of future programs.
Definitions of tolerance vary, from "putting up with" oth-
ers, to being genuinely interested in understanding and
knowing about them, and the strongest predictors may
depend somewhat on the definition used. Our measure of
openness to diversity assessed the degree to which partici-
pants accepted similarities and differences, had both past and
intended interpersonal contact, and felt an emotional bond
with others who differed from them in a variety of ways,
including age, gender, race, abilities, and sexual orientation.
Although resolution of identity versus ego confusion signifi-
cantly predicted our measure of openness to diversity, reso-
lution of the next stage of intimacy versus isolation was an
even stronger predictor, and principled moral reasoning was
a significant but relatively weak predictor. A mere absence of
intolerance, however, may be more closely linked to resolu-
tion of the adolescent identity struggle as well as to concerns
about morality. Research should explore further which pre-
dictors are strongest, based on an intervention's goals.
We also found suggestive evidence for multiple possible
pathways. Might some individuals be open to diversity
because of feelings of empathy, others because of what they
have reasoned to be fair, and others because they have
enough security in their own identity that they are not threat-
ened by differences? Considering how to assess an individu-
al's developmental readiness and intrapersonal strengths or
needs may be helpful for creating successful programs.
Tolerance and mutual respect are crucial for peaceful
coexistence and success in today's multicultural and global
society. Institutions of higher learning are attempting to
address the challenge with programs to build tolerance.
Emerging adulthood, with its new-found potentials for matu-
rity, is a particularly fruitful time, developmentally, to
address the acceptance of others, and understanding the com-
plex array of factors involved in promoting openness to
diversity may be helpful for developing the most effective
programs possible.
