The Need for a New
MacroeconomicTheory
The financial crisis of 2008 cannot be considered as a tradi-
tional business cycle that the capitalist economy produces
from time to time. The crisis provoked a dramatic fall in
world international trade, world output, world employment,
and a serious deterioration of public indebtedness for many
governments, forced to rescue their banking system from
bankruptcy. Charles Kindleberger (1973) considers the great
depression, following the crash of 1929, as caused by the
difficult transition from an international economic order led
by Great Britain to a new international economic order led
by the United States. The present crisis is of the same order
of magnitude, but its evolution and outcome will be different
because although the world leadership of the United States
is declining, no other super-superpowers can replace it. The
international institutions (United Nations [UN], International
Monetary Fund [IMF], General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade­World Trade Organization [GATT-WTO], etc.),
created on the initiative of the United States after the Second
World War, worked sufficiently well during the cold war and
the two decades following the breakdown of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics, but the international political
system has now changed profoundly. Not only are new big
powers, like China, India, and Brazil, willing to share with
the old industrialized countries--the United States, Russia,
Europe, and Japan--the power to lead the world economy
but also new dramatic challenges, such as the risk of an eco-
logical collapse of the biosphere, need to be faced. A new
multipolar world is taking shape.Anew political and economic
thinking is required.

Money and Finance as Global
Public Goods: Contribution to a
Supranational MacroeconomicTheory
Guido Montani1
Abstract
The 2007-2008 financial crisis caused not only a dramatic fall in global output and employment but also a serious deterioration
of public indebtedness for many governments, forced to rescue the banking system from failure. The crisis showed that
national governments are not able to regulate the global market by means of the traditional instruments of political economy.
The aim of this article is to identify new supranational instruments of economic policy.As a first step, to avoid a new financial
crisis, it is necessary to understand the intimate connection between the international monetary system, founded on the
dollar as key currency, and the international financial system. Only some economists were able to see the causes of the
recent crisis as a by-product of an asymmetric monetary system. In this article, after having discussed the monetary roots of
the financial crisis, the discussion is focused on monetary sovereignty, financial sovereignty, and fiscal sovereignty as the main
economic responsibilities of a national government, to show that, today, a supranational economic government should have
similar powers.An appendix (disposable on the website of the author) on "Global imbalances:A false objective of economic
policy" shows how the balance of payments imposes wrong goals to national economic policies.The discussion is focused on
(a) the neo-Ricardian theory of economic integration, (b) financial capital flows, and (c) the Keynesian equations of an open
economy.

Because the epicenter of the financial crisis has been
located in the United States, many studies and essays deal
with the U.S. economy and suggest reforms, which should
be adopted by the U.S. government to avoid a new crisis and
guarantee sustainable development. The implicit assumption
is that the recovery of the U.S. economy will give a substan-
tial contribution to the recovery and stability of the world
economy; in other words, the United States is regarded as the
stabilizer of global economy. Indeed, in the old hegemonic
system, this was more or less the role of the United States--
but that is the past. The financial crisis of 2008 marks a turn-
ing point: In the new multipolar world, no single country, not
even the United States, will have the hegemonic power to
lead the world. National reforms are not enough. We need
a new world political and economic order. Only within
the framework of a cooperative multipolar order, national
reforms can be conceived and can be successful.
It is encouraging that some leading American economists
understand the new role that the United States should play in
international politics. For instance, Joseph Stiglitz, after
having reconstructed the events causing the financial crisis
with great accuracy, criticizes market fundamentalism--the
notion that unfettered markets by themselves can ensure
economic prosperity and growth--as the main cause of the
United States's wrong policy and supports the idea that a bet-
ter balance between the market and government should be
found. Stiglitz (2010) says,
Enhancing economic performance requires improving
both markets and government. There is no basis to the
argument that because governments sometimes fail,
they should not intervene in markets when the markets
fail--just as there is no basis to the converse argument
that because markets sometimes fail they should be
abandoned. (p. 245)
Moreover, Stiglitz (2010) recognizes that the United
States cannot promote the recovery alone but should cooper-
ate with other countries to build a new international order,
founded on a new reserve currency, as the Special Drawing
Rights (SDRs) issued by the IMF, because the dollar can no
longer play the role of key currency for the international
monetary system. Even Fred Bergsten (2009) is very clear
about the link between internal and external reforms, which
should be conceived as a new "global rebalancing strategy."
Bergsten says,
By reducing the systemic role of the dollar and build-
ing up the international position of other currencies and
SDRs, the United States would increase its own incen-
tives to limit its deficits and enable other countries to
add to their reserves without running surpluses. The
cumulative effect would be greater prospects for inter-
national monetary stability and a reduced likelihood of
future crises. (p. 36)
Nevertheless, the most explicit acknowledgment of the
need for a new macroeconomic theory is put forward by
Jeffrey Sachs (2009), who says, "Sustained and widespread
future prosperity will require basic reforms in global macro-
economic governance and in macroeconomic science"
(p. 1).The United States and all other industrialized countries
should approve economic policies to increase their saving--
by imposing new taxes, like the carbon tax--and invest in
critical public goods, to face the challenges of climate change,
higher education, public health, and world poverty. "A new
strategy of economic governance, one that is structural and
global is now needed, and a new science of macroeconomics
must supersede the stale debate of Keynesian and rational
expectations theories." The new macroeconomic science,
Sachs correctly affirms, is necessary because "bridging the
divide of macroeconomics and global governance is exactly
the challenge we face, both in policy and scientific terms"
(Sachs, 2009, p. 8).
In dealing with these problems, I share two points of view.
As a world citizen born in Europe, I consider European inte-
gration as a workshop for world integration too because the
European Union (EU) is the first experiment of suprana-
tional integration. The second point of view is that of an econ-
omist trained in studying classical political economy during
the years subsequent to the publication of Sraffa's Production
of Commodities by Means of Commodities: It was the dis-
covery and exploration of a new paradigm, alternative to
the dominant neoclassical economic theory. But very soon
I realized how difficult it was to understand the problems of
European integration in the theoretical framework of classi-
cal political economy. It is true that in Adam Smith and
Ricardo, we can find some very useful principles, such as the
principle of comparative costs, to analyze the international
economy. But these principles are insufficient to understand
the European experience, which consisted mainly of building
supranational institutions and supranational public goods,
like the Common Market and the European Monetary Union
(EMU). Afterward, it became clear to me that not only clas-
sical political economy but also the modern theory of interna-
tionaleconomicsdidnotconsidertheproblemofsupranational
institutions prominent. For instance, international monetary
problems are analyzed as the choice between fixed and flex-
ible rates of exchanges. The third way of a monetary union
was not taken seriously into consideration until the creation
of the EMU.
To find the appropriate means for the government of the
global economy, the most promising starting point is Keynes's
macroeconomic theory. It is true that the General Theory
was conceived for a closed economy, but Keynes himself
was obliged to work out an international institutional frame-
work of his system, an International Monetary Union, on the
occasion of the Bretton Woods conference. The challenge, for
today's economists, is to renovate the General Theory for the
government of the global economy. The challenge is twofold.
We need to shape not only new theoretical instruments for a
Montani 3
global economic policy but also new institutions. In Keynes's
General Theory, the institutions of the nation state--a national
money and a national budget--were not even discussed; they
were a common accepted heritage of the 19th century.
The Monetary Roots
of the Financial Crisis
Because the financial crisis of 2008 was not followed by a
dollar crisis, many economists focus their attention on the
dysfunction of the American financial system. Of course,
these dysfunctions exist, are serious, and should be elimi-
nated by better regulation. But the roots of the crisis remain
in the international monetary system, built at Bretton Woods
as a gold-exchange standard and, after the declaration of the
inconvertibility of the dollar, transformed in a dollar stan-
dard. One of the features of the international utilization of
the dollar as the key currency for international transactions
is that the United States can pay their imports with their
national money. Therefore, the United States is not obliged
to maintain the balance of payment in equilibrium and to
keep a reserve currency. These privileges of the dollar caused
an enormous increase in the international reserves, which
rose 20 times from 1969 to 2000. They rose only 1.5 times
from 1949 to 1969 (Duncan, 2005). If international reserves
can be considered an index of international liquidity, it is
reasonable to say that the dollar standard caused an excess
of liquidity in the world because total exports increased
only 5 times in volume, but 25 times in value, during the
same period--from 1969 to 2000 world gross domestic
product (GDP) increased 2.7 times (WTO­International
Trade Statistics, 1950-2008, Appendix 1a).
Some economists were able to foresee the negative effects
of the dollar standard well in advance. Robert Triffin, who in
1960 showed the inconsistencies of the gold-exchange stan-
dard and its inevitable breakdown, in 1992 labeled the dollar
standard "International Monetary Scandal," because it could
"easily degenerate into a self-feeding spiral of inflationary
reserve increases, since these are reinvested in the reserve
centres and increase the ability of their leaders--official and
private--to pursue inflationary policies" (Triffin 1992, p. 14).
Triffin's (1992) analysis embodied the main causes of the
present financial crisis. Indeed, we can read the recent analy-
sis of Richard Duncan, The Dollar Crisis (2003, 2005), as a
restatement of Triffin's point of view. According to Duncan,
the Japanese crisis of 1990 and the Asian crisis of 1997
should be considered a by-product of the dollar standard.
During the 1960s, Japan was able to base its industrial pro-
duction and growth on its capacity to export. But during
the 1980s, Japan's trade surplus increased so much that the
country was obliged to accumulate international reserves
(they increased by 260% between 1985 and 1988). In the
same period, the internal money supply increased sharply
and so did the credit supply, causing a boom in the house
market and stock exchange.
All credit bubbles ultimately end in deflation because
the purchasing power of the public does not increase
quickly enough to absorb the surge in production
that results from extended periods of easy credit. In
other words, the ability of the public to buy does not
increase in line with the capacity of industry to pro-
duce. When product prices begin to fall, debtors find
they are no longer able to pay interest on their debt.
Bankruptcies follow, credit contracts, and the economy
enters recession. The Japanese bubble ended the same
way. (Duncan, 2005, p. 31)
The Asian crisis of 1997 was different from the Japanese
one only in some details, but the general trend was the same.
In Thailand, the crisis was not caused by a trade surplus but
by the surplus in financial account. Foreign capitals entered
as direct foreign investments, portfolio investments in the
stock market, and deposits placed in the Thai financial sys-
tem. But even in Thailand, we can detect an increase in for-
eign reserves, in money supply and credit, and a bubble in
the house market and the stock exchange. The explosion of
the bubble economy was followed by a flight of capitals, a
foreign exchange crisis, and a dramatic fall in GDP (about
35%, from 1997 to 2003). A similar pattern was followed in
South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia (whose GDP fell by
55%, from 1997 to 2003).
For the United States, the increase of world reserves
cannot be a direct cause of the crisis. But the excess of
international liquidity worked as a boomerang for the U.S.
economy, which was considered, before the crisis, the
borrower and spender of last resort of the world economy
(Wolf, 2009). During the last decade, the U.S. economy
exploited the chance of importing very cheap goods from
developing countries, mainly from China, which contributed
to the mitigation of prices and wage demand. The gross
domestic purchases, in the 1993-2004 period, rose by 53%,
whereas GDP grew only by 46%, so that a huge current
account deficit (6% of GDP, in 2006) was inevitable. The
external deficit was covered by an inflow of foreign capitals
coming mainly from surplus countries, especially China.
The inflow of capitals helped the Federal Reserve System
(FED) to maintain the low interest rate, which stimulated
the boom in residential property market. Indeed, the United
States
successfully absorbed much of the excess savings of
the rest of the world. It has done so by promoting
rapid growth of demand and, in particular, of con-
sumption. The household sector has been principally
responsible for the excess of spending over incomes.
(Wolf, 2009, p. 106)
Therefore, without entering in a precise description of the
financial crisis, we can understand well the remark of the UN
report, according to which
4 SAGE Open
The sub-prime crisis, which led to a wider crisis in
credit markets, was partly engendered by an "excess"
supply of liquidity and the failure of the Central Bank
in the United States and some other advanced indus-
trial countries to act to restrain liquidity and dampen
the speculative increases in housing prices. (Report of
UN, 2009, p. 17)
If we consider the monetary policy of the FED in the
wider context of the international economy, it is easy to
understand why, as Triffin said, for the U.S. policy makers it
was reasonable to favor a world liquidity spree.
After the financial crisis of 2008, how can a world recov-
ery be stimulated? It is unlikely that the United States can
work again as the "borrower and spender of last resort," and
the European economy is certainly not able to replace the
United States as the world engine of growth. Moreover, to
avoid the collapse of the banking system, the governments of
the United States and the EU were obliged to bail out some
financial institutions and launch "Keynesian" plans to sup-
port internal demand and employment. The debt of the United
States increased from 64.6% of GDP in 2005 to 98.1% in
2010; in EU-27, the total debt increased from 61.6% of GDP
in 2008 to 73.6% in 2009 (in Eurozone from 69.4% in 2008
to 78.7% in 2009). In both economies, the rate of unemploy-
ment is well above the average of the years preceding the
crisis. In 2009, world production fell by nearly 2%; the world
productive capacity is underutilized. But to affirm that the
world economy is depressed is dubious because China, India,
Brazil, and other emerging economies are experiencing a
rapid rate of growth. The index of world exports, which was
120 in July 2008, fell to 70 in January 2009 and is recover-
ing toward the level of 100 (WTO data). The concept of
effective world demand can be questioned because there are
as many effective demands as there are national moneys and
their sum is meaningless (to sum a depressed economy and
a booming economy does not result in a full employment
economy). In any case, because the problem of governing the
global economy exists, it is necessary to clarify what we
mean by an effective global demand policy.
We can split the problem of effective global demand into
two parts. For industrialized countries (United States, Europe,
and Japan) the main problem is a noninflationary recovery.
Until now, the emergency plans adopted by governments
were based mainly on supporting consumption demand. We
agree with Sachs that, today, there is the need to support
investment plans to promote social and ecological sustainable
development. The age of consumerism is over. For emerging
economies, one of the main obstacles to their development is
the abnormal need for external reserves. As the UN Report
says,
While it is rational for individual countries to "insure"
against another crisis through the build-up of exter-
nal surpluses and foreign reserves, doing so weakens
aggregate demand. . . . It is possible that when many
countries simultaneously attempt to build up reserves
the global economy will suffer from generalised insuf-
ficiency of aggregate demand--a global version of the
well-known paradox of thrift. (Report of the UN, 2009,
p. 21)
In the following pages, we try to single out the main
economic institutions required to regulate effective global
demand. Our point of view is that some of the economic insti-
tutions built within the nation state are becoming today inef-
fective in a global economy. Therefore, we examine the
problems of monetary sovereignty, financial sovereignty, and
fiscal sovereignty because some important public goods--
like monetary and financial stability, international justice, and
sustainable development--can be supplied only by appropri-
ate supranational institutions. For this research, the European
experience of integration can represent a useful model, even
if the EMU is a very imperfect construction as far as financial
and fiscal sovereignties are concerned (Defraigne, 2010).
Monetary Sovereignty
The three sovereignties are interconnected. In a closed econ-
omy, the central government is usually responsible for these
three policies. In open economies, the question is more com-
plicated. The EU is the only case in which monetary sover-
eignty belongs to European authorities, while financial
and fiscal sovereignties belong to national authorities. The
Maastricht treaty stated that the European Central Bank
(ECB) has the primary duty to guarantee price stability.
Monetary stability and low interest rates were considered
the basis for sound national financial policies and growth.
Moreover, to pursue these objectives in an interdependent
economy, the EU chose a flexible rate of exchange for the
euro. The financial crisis showed how fragile this construc-
tion is. The flexible rate of exchange was not a strong-enough
bulwark to isolate the EU economy from the 2008 turmoil
because the European banks were strictly involved in the
global financial system. Now, the EMU is entering a phase
of radical reforms.
These interrelationships also exist in the global economy.
The international monetary system, as we saw in the previ-
ous paragraph, is the vector of international finance. Whoever
holds the reins of international money and international liquid-
ity has some objective advantage, without having the correla-
tive duties (world monetary stability). Indeed, it is exactly this
asymmetry which was brought into light by the governor of
the People's Bank of China before the G20 of April 2009.
Zhou Xiaochuan (2009) affirms that the country issuing a
reserve currency is "constantly confronted with the dilemma
between achieving their domestic monetary goals and meet-
ing the other countries' demand for reserve currency . . . the
Triffin dilemma . . . still exists." For this reason, Zhou pro-
posed to substitute the dollar as a reserve currency with
Montani 5
SDRs issued by the IMF. Because the reform of the interna-
tional monetary system is on the agenda of the G20, the
debate is open and many scholars have already put forward
proposals for reforms (Cooper, 2009; Kenen, 2010;
Kregel, 2009; Mateos y Lago, Duttagupta, & Goyal, 2009;
Williamson, 2009). Here, let us consider the straightforward
proposal of a world monetary union. Usually, the reforms
of the international monetary system are discussed without
clarifying this implicit point of arrival. On the contrary, at
Bretton Woods, both Keynes and White, in their original
plan, envisaged a world money for the future. Let us now
consider the cost and benefits of a world monetary union. In
the final paragraph, a transitory step is suggested.
The world has experimented long phases of stability and
growth by means of a system of fixed exchange rates during
the gold standard of the 19th century and the gold-exchange
standard of the last century. But, as the economic theory
explains, with capital mobility, a system of fixed exchange
rates cannot survive.Acountry cannot simultaneously choose
an independent monetary policy, fixed exchange rates, and
free capital movements. The alternative is a system of float-
ing exchange rates. But the experience of the last decades
shows that only big economies, with important internal mar-
kets, like the United States and the EU, can afford the vaga-
ries of a system in which, daily, capital movements are
hundred of times bigger than trade transactions. For under-
developed economies, this system is devastating. They need
monetary and financial stability, to spur industrial develop-
ment. A certain "fear of floating" is understandable; in some
cases, "dollarization" was preferred to monetary instability.
Therefore, the creation of a world monetary union is crucial
for the stability of the world economy and the development
of poor countries.
Of course, this decision has also some transitory costs,
which should be dealt with. A monetary union involves, in
the last resort, the free movement of commodities and capi-
tals. Concerning this point, Friedrich List's critique to free
trade is well known: The German agricultural economy was
supposed to protect its "infant industry" until fair competi-
tion with industrialized Great Britain became feasible.
Competition is fair only among countries with the same
degree of development, but in the 21st century, it is not
difficult to provide sensible replies to these understandable
fears (Frankman, 2002). The United States and the EU have
found many policies to face internal regional problems; in
the world monetary union, trade and capital mobility among
countries should be considered regional problems. They can
be solved if a minimum degree of solidarity exists among
industrialized and emerging peoples. For instance, as far as
trade is concerned, some stabilization funds, like Stabex and
Sysmin created by the EU in the framework of the Lomé
Convention to stabilize the incomes of African, Caribbean,
and Pacific countries, can also be created within the UN. Of
course, these funds should be financed by a UN budget,
which at present does not exist. As far as capital mobility is
concerned, the real problem is not to avoid geographical
mobility, but to regulate the behavior of foreign direct invest-
ment and multinational firms in hosting countries, to abide
by local law, including minimum wages and taxation. A
world monetary union can represent the starting point for a
more equal distribution of income among poor and rich peo-
ples and for the curtailing of the exorbitant power of finan-
cial capitals, today free to go into the most convenient "fiscal
paradise."
Now, let us examine the problem of global imbalances.
In the world's balance of payments, the total of surplus and
deficits should be zero. If we take the 2006 accounts into
consideration, just before the crisis, we can see that the EU,
including the United Kingdom, was more or less in balance,
the Asian countries (Japan and China included) and the oil-
exporting countries showed a big surplus, while the U.S. defi-
cit counterbalanced the total surplus. China's surplus was
9.5% of GDP, and non-Asian emerging countries had a sur-
plus of 5.2% of GDP. This picture confirms the role of the
United States as the borrower and consumer of last resort
and of emerging economies as savers and lenders of last
resort--exactly the opposite of what should happen among
rich and poor countries. It is the real side of Triffin's inter-
national monetary scandal.
There is a lively debate on the causes and impacts of global
imbalances (for a survey, ECB, 2010). Here, our aim is sim-
ply to show how a world monetary union could help to "rebal-
ance" the world economy. In a single monetary area, nobody
cares about the balance of payments of a city, a province, or
a region. Everyday economic life shows that some regions
are more developed than others, some regions offer more
opportunities for investments and jobs than others, and so
on. An integrated economy involves an endless improve-
ment in the division of labor within the firms and the market;
geographical imbalances are the rule, not the exception. A
world monetary union, by itself, can contribute to rebalanc-
ing the world economy by eliminating the need for interna-
tional reserves. If every country utilizes the same currency,
as in the EMU, there is no need for foreign reserves because
liquidity is supplied to the banking system, in the last resort,
by the common central bank. This means that the balance of
payments can no longer be exploited for political reasons.
Let us consider the present imbalance between China and the
United States. In 2009, China had almost half of the total
reserves of the emerging economies. The United States feared
a sudden stop of the reinvestment of Chinese reserves in U.S.
Treasury bonds. China feared a sudden devaluation of the
dollar. It is difficult to say who will win this game, which is
also connected to military and power politics. In any case, the
adoption of a common currency will eliminate any possibility
to exploit the balance of payment for political reasons. In a
world monetary union, a surplus country, like China, has
no particular advantage in having a surplus in its current
account; the only problem is to sell Chinese commodities
in the world market. Of course, if Chinese commodities are
6 SAGE Open
sold in foreign markets, "foreign money" will flow into the
Chinese banking system. In the past, foreign reserves (in dol-
lars) were an instrument of power in the hand of the central
government. But if this instrument evaporates, the best way
to utilize the incoming money is to use it to increase the peo-
ple's standard of living. Today, China saves 50% to 60% of
its GDP. Private savings are high, even if the main share
comes from corporate saving and government. Households
receive a little share of total production. The share of con-
sumption in GDP declined from 46% in 2000 to 36% in
2009. Today, the main problem of the Chinese economy is
to increase the share of consumption at a rate greater than
the rate of growth. That will cause a reduction in investments
and the surplus of the current account (Pettis, 2010). This
radical change in economic policy is certainly difficult, but
it is time, for the Chinese government, to let the wage rate
increase quickly and to provide better social services, even if
the competitive advantages of Chinese commodities in the
global market are eroded.
For the United States, a deficit country, the creation of a
world monetary union is a major change. After the financial
crisis, the U.S. monetary policy has to face Triffin's dilemma
anew. The recovery requires very low rates of interest, to
favor home investments and consumptions, and, thanks to a
devaluation of the dollar, an increase in exports. But a too
strong devaluation of the dollar will lower the value of the
dollar reserves held by emerging economies, which could
decide to substitute the dollar with the euro or some other cur-
rency. A flight from the dollar could cause a new global crisis
with dramatic consequences for the world economy. A world
monetary union would eliminate Triffin's dilemma from the
roots. Not only can the dollar no longer be devalued against
other currencies but also the rate of interest would be fixed,
in the world market, by world monetary authorities (as
explained in the last paragraph). These changes would help
the federal government to spur the reforms that theAmerican
economy needs. The household rate of saving was only 2%
of GDP before the crisis; during the crisis, consumption
decreased, but "the rapid rise in household saving was offset
by an even more rapid rise in public borrowing" (Stiglitz,
2010, p. 189). The money borrowed by the government--
required to support internal demand--came mainly from
abroad. The U.S. economy cannot live forever consuming
more than its income. In a world monetary union nobody
needs dollars as international reserve and the U.S. government
cannot rely forever on surplus countries to finance itsTreasury
bonds. Of course, the American financial market will remain
for years to come the strongest market of the world, and many
capitals will look for investments in the American market.
But the U.S. Treasury bonds should compete with other
public bonds in the world financial market, where the risk of
sudden devaluation is removed. Therefore, the U.S. budget
should be rebalanced and should respect, more or less, the
same rules of the European Growth and Stability Pact.
Contrary to what is commonly believed, the loss of national
monetary policy is not a tragedy. The European governments
are learning that they should spend the money collected by
taxing their citizens more carefully. It is a problem not only
of public morality but also of utilizing the public budget to
promote the investments and the infrastructures the society
and market need. The American economy must face the chal-
lenge of a new model of development. The American econ-
omy consumes too much energy and pollutes the atmosphere
too much. In the past, the negative American stance on the
occasion of the UN conferences on climate change was one of
the main causes of their failure. Because citizens' consump-
tion models change slowly, the government should favor more
social investments with appropriate reforms.
Of course, a full discussion on global imbalances requires
much more space. A monetary union can sometimes increase
imbalances, as in the case of regional congestion. An appro-
priate fiscal policy can become necessary. Nevertheless, in
the appendix we try to show that instead of looking for inge-
nious policies to rebalance international economy, without
discussing the crucial problem of world money, it is best to
cut the Gordian knot.
Financial Sovereignty
According to Hyman Minsky, the capitalist system is struc-
turally unstable, mainly because "over periods of prolonged
prosperity, the economy transits from financial relations that
make for a stable system to financial relations that make for
an unstable system" (Minsky, 1992). The global financial
crisis showed that Minsky's view of financial markets is more
correct than that of market fundamentalists. The problem to
face, now, is how to avoid a new crisis. If Minsky's financial
instability hypothesis is correct, a permanent solution to capi-
talism instability is impossible, but we can find some reforms
to diminish the risks of instability. Appropriate institutions
increase security and stability.
Financial crises are usually followed by sovereign debt
crises (Reinhard & Rogoff, 2009), as the case of Greece in
the EMU showed. In this paragraph, we deal with the first
problem only. The 2008 crisis showed that, in the United
States and Europe, the governments were caught between
bailing out some ailing banks and letting them fail, with cata-
strophic consequences for the banking and financial system.
The governments decided to avoid a systemic crisis, but the
cost was a huge increase in public debt. The banking sector is
a special industry; to function properly, it needs strict public
supervision and regulation, such as deposit insurance and
reserve requirements. The governments' decision to bail out
some banks has successfully restored confidence but has also
increased the risk of moral hazard. There is now a category of
banks "too-big-to-fail," which can behave outside the pru-
dential rules established for the banking system; because they
do not fear bankruptcy, they can assume disproportionate
Montani 7
risks. Without new rules, the banking system privatizes its
gains and socializes its losses.
The debate on the dilemma--either bail-it-out or let-it-
fail--shows that there is a third way: the creation of a resolu-
tion authority. On one hand, there is the need to change
banking and financial rules concerning credit for mortgages,
trade finance, and corporate investments. On these issues, the
Basel committee proposes new rules on bank governance. On
the other hand, one of the causes of the crisis was the official
supervisor authorities' incapacity, central banks included, to
diagnose the malfunctioning of the financial market and to
intervene. The official authority should intervene ex-ante
and not ex-post, to declare bankruptcy, as happened with
Lehman brothers. A new institution is required. The
resolution authority may decide to seize the bank when
it is still functioning, take control and separate or sell
certain parts or assets of the bank, remove its manage-
ment, freeze the rights of shareholders and creditors
and reorganize or wind down the bank. It may agree on
deals with the bank's counterparties, etcetera. All this
will reduce the disorder and damage in the financial
markets and result in orderly liquidation or merger.
(Ruding, 2010, p. 3)
The United States and the EU are reforming their banking
and financial system. Of course, the reforms take the differ-
ent features of the two economies into consideration. For
instance, the banking sector is more important in Europe,
compared with the financial system, than in the United States;
in 2007, bank loans were 145% of the euro-area GDP and
only 63% in the United States. But the real difference is the
institutional system: fully federal in the United States and
semifederal in the EU. Indeed, in 2010, the United States
approved a law embedding the so-called Volker rule, which
prohibits a bank from engaging in proprietary trading and
from owning or investing in hedge funds as well as limiting
the liabilities that the largest banks could hold. The purpose
is to reduce banking activities and their size, in view of
resolving the too-big-to-fail dilemma. Moreover, the law
includes new government powers to break up any company
that becomes so big that its failure could threaten the econ-
omy. All in all, the U.S. law includes the principle of a reso-
lution authority.
The EU is following another path. The EU has a federal
monetary system but no federal fiscal system and no fed-
eral government. The proposals of the EU Commission are
very cautious. It proposes a European Systemic Risk Board
(ESRB) that would be responsible for macroprudential over-
sight of the financial system but without binding powers
to impose measures on member states. The ESRB, mainly
entrusted to the ECB, can address warnings and recommen-
dations. Moreover, the commission proposes to establish a
European System of Financial Supervisors, consisting of a
network of national financial supervisors working in tandem
with the reformed European supervisory committees.
The two new authorities should cooperate closely to
assure a smoother supervising interaction at macroprudential
and microprudential levels (Commission of the European
Communities, 2009).
Here, our task is not to discuss the details of the European
and American reforms. Our aim is to highlight the connec-
tions among monetary, financial, and fiscal sovereignties. As
far as monetary and financial sovereignties are concerned,
economic theory clarifies the link very well. In the case of
a financial crisis,
everyone will demand liquidity . . . and everyone in the
system understands that the only liquidity that really
exists is central bank money . . . So when there is finan-
cial instability, there is likely to be monetary instability.
This establishes a link between the natural role of the
central bank as a provider of payments finality and its
role in financial stability. (Schinasi, 2003, p. 9)
Concerning the link with fiscal sovereignty, the European
case is interesting because it clearly shows that without a
European financial system, national governments strive to
maintain the core of oversight powers in their hands, thus
breeding uncertainty. The decision on the bailing out or fail-
ure of a bank involves a parallel decision on public finances.
Therefore, because the EU has a tiny budget, not big enough
for this kind of policy, the powers of last resort rest with the
member states, not with the EU. But in such a case, a real
European supervision is practically impossible; indeed, the
ESRB can address only warnings and recommendations. If a
financial crisis hits several European banks simultaneously,
some national governments can decide not necessarily in
agreement with other governments; for instance, one govern-
ment is in favor of the bailout and another for the failure of
a certain bank. For this reason, so far, a European resolution
authority has not been seriously taken into consideration.
The European case is useful to understand the difficulties
in creating an efficient financial supervisory board in the inter-
national framework. Even if the G20 has set up a Financial
Stability Board, it is doubtful that a world resolution author-
ity would be created. Without solving the parallel world
financial problem, the global financial system is doomed to
remain unstable for many years.
Fiscal Sovereignty
The original debate on the theory of the optimum currency
areas has only incidentally considered the link with fiscal
sovereignty (the exception is Kenen, 1969). The European
experience, with the Maastricht treaty, did not help to enlighten
the problem. Indeed, the EU budget was about 1% of the
EU-GDPbefore Maastricht and is till today of the same amount,
even though a debate on its reform is open. Therefore, we
are obliged to refer to the theory of fiscal federalism to
8 SAGE Open
discuss the fiscal problems of a supranational union of national
peoples. The theory of fiscal federalism was shaped on
the experience of the existing federations, mainly the United
States (for a survey, Oates, 2008). The main limit of this
approach is that fiscal federalism is considered a theory of
fiscal decentralization. On the contrary, the main international
problems are exactly the opposite: to fix the tasks and the
fiscal powers of a supranational government. The central tasks
and powers of the existing federations are not necessarily the
same as those of a future supranational government.
This awkward problem was almost ignored in interna-
tional political economy until recently because the perspec-
tiveofasupranationalgovernmentwasconsideredunrealistic.
But the recent and lively debate on global public goods
raised the problem not only of their implementation but also
of their financing. From the economic point of view, a public
good is a good not produced by the market--because no
firms can get a profit from its production--and it has the
qualities of nonexcludability and nonrivalry. A global public
good benefits all peoples and all national governments. Here,
we profit from this new perspective, recalling that the main
principle of fiscal federalism--sometimes also defined multi-
level finance--is that every level of government should be
independent but coordinate with other governments. The
best way to coordinate different governments is to draw a con-
stitution, but the EU grew on the basis of intergovernmental
treaties. For a government, to be independent and coordinated
means that its tasks and its financial means should be defined
with the maximum accuracy to avoid overlapping with the
tasks and powers of other governments. From that point of
view, it is important to refer to the so-called subsidiarity prin-
ciple: A certain task (policy) should be assigned to the lowest
level of government if possible but to the higher level when
the lower government is not able to provide a certain public
good or can provide it only inefficiently (with higher costs).
Fromthebroaddebateonglobalpublicgoods(International
Task Force on Global Public Goods, 2006; Kaul, Grunberg,
& Stern, 1999; Stiglitz, 2006), we pick out some uncontrover-
sial issues: international security, economic stability, and sus-
tainable development. Of course, international security falls
outside the horizon of macroeconomic theory. We only recall
that, according to us, an important and reasonable step for-
ward is the reform, proposed in 1992 by the UN secretary
general, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to create a military peace-
enforcement unit at the disposal of the UN Security Council.
From a comprehensive point of view, international security is
a precondition for international cooperation and a new eco-
nomic order. As far as international economic stability is con-
cerned, we have already tried to show that a world monetary
union and a supranational authority for supervising the finan-
cial market should be considered the crucial institutions to
provide this public good--but this is not enough. The world
community must face other challenges, which can be epito-
mized in the general perspective of sustainable development.
With this general label, usually people talk about two different
problems. The first is the impact of economic growth on natu-
ral resources. The spread of industrialization in all countries
produces serious external effects: Life on the planet will be
increasingly in danger if industrial growth does not become
sustainable. The second problem is social sustainable devel-
opment. The enormous gap between the standard of living of
rich and poor people is considered not only a scandal but also
the cause of many other problems, like emigration and terror-
ism. The UN is the main forum for the organization of aid to
development, to fight poverty and protect health, to over-
come discrimination against women, and to spread literacy.
These two aspects of sustainable development were, in the
past, faced with specific policies and agencies. But now, it is
increasingly clear that they should be considered as different
aspects of the same problem: a sustainable development plan
to save the planet and to realize international justice (Stern,
2009). The difficult debate within the UN for an effective
global policy against climate change shows that one of the
hurdles to overcome is the unequal responsibility of the
emerging economies for planet pollution compared with
industrialized countries. Rich countries started to pollute the
planet 250 years ago, at the beginning of the industrial era.
Therefore, the total costs of the fight against climate change
should be allocated not on a per capita formula but according
to the pollution accumulated by all people. Rich and poor
people are not at the same level in the playing field.
A UN budget, of the same relative size as the EU budget,
financed mainly by ecotaxes and taxes on financial capitals,
is a crucial means for global governance. It can be used
to finance a world police force, as suggested by Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, and to plan for sustainable development,
including scientific research to face epidemic diseases
and ecological threats. Moreover, a UN endowed with fis-
cal competences can help national governments to face the
increasing power of private global finance, which over-
whelms national powers and their capability to issue public
debt. The two problems are connected because the real guar-
antee for buyers of public bonds is the capacity of the gov-
ernment to collect taxes. The development of a global
financial market has greatly reduced tax revenues coming
from capital and increased the pressure on unqualified labor
and other immovable factors. In the global financial market,
countries do not cooperate but compete to exploit the com-
mon tax base. For a single country, it becomes impossible to
impose higher tax rates than other countries on financial capi-
tal and highly skilled labor. Because every country tries to
exploit the same tax base, the strategy of exporting national
fiscal pressure, attracting consumers and capitals from other
countries with low tax rates, is becoming more and more
popular (Tanzi, 2000, 2002). The way out from the increas-
ing erosion of national fiscal sovereignty is the creation of a
Supranational FiscalAuthority within the UN with the power
to tax multinational firms and global financial capitals. A
Montani 9
share of the revenue collected by the authority can finance
the UN budget.
A Macroeconomic Policy for
a Supranational Government
The great depression of the 1930s was the main spur for
Keynes's General Theory. Keynes conceived a macroeco-
nomic theory to solve the problems of a closed economy.
Today's international macroeconomic theory overcomes this
original sin only marginally, because it studies the behavior
of open national economies cooperating spontaneously with-
out the need of supranational institutions. For instance, the
international monetary problem is basically considered as
the choice between fixed and flexible rates of exchange: The
third way, a monetary union--a supranational public good--
is not usually taken into consideration. After the global finan-
cial crisis, the time is ripe for a radical renewal of the
macroeconomic theory. In this article, our aim was to show
that some crucial economic problems could be better solved
with the creation of supranational institutions, when interna-
tional cooperation fails.
In a nation state, the central government holds the reins of
monetary, financial, and fiscal policies. In the international
market, the problem is to centralize some of these functions,
when competition among national institutions can cause major
market failures. Usually, in economic theory, this problem
coincides with the detection of the free-ride behavior of a pub-
lic goods consumer. In international economics, the ideological
screen of national sovereignty prevents a clear understanding
of the problem, which is faced firstly by means of intergovern-
mental cooperation and not by supranational institutions.
The reform of the international monetary system is a case
in point. The governor of the Chinese Central Bank under-
stood that the financial crisis was a by-product of the dollar
standard, but his advice is shaped in the traditional intergov-
ernmental framework. The dollar, the present international
reserve currency, should be replaced by SDRs issued by the
IMF. This proposal goes in the right direction, but it does not
dispute the monetary sovereignty of nation states, which can
continue to issue their currency according to the liquidity
requirement of their national economy. The problem of man-
aging global liquidity remains unresolved. Rightly, Richard
Cooper observes that the SDRs can play only a "modest
role" in solving international monetary problems. Of course,
they can "reduce the pressure many countries evidently feel
to earn additional reserves" and "this in turn would lead to
some reduction in current account deficits around the world,
notably in the United States" (Cooper, 2010, p. 11). But the
dollar will remain the main reserve currency because gov-
ernments will find it convenient to invest their reserves in
the U.S. financial market.
If the proposal of a world monetary union is taken into
consideration, the same practical step could be suggested and
realized in a short time. Of course, a world bank cannot be
built in just a few years, but a world monetary policy can be
simulated if the political will exists among the governments
of the G20. Let us suppose that the G20 countries (or an
important group of countries) agree to adopt a "global infla-
tion target" (Taylor, 2009, p. 63) of 3%. This reform (as sug-
gested in Mundell, 2005, and Fiorentini & Montani, 2010)
does not require the immediate creation of a supranational
institution; in practice, it is similar to the informal rules of the
game followed by central banks during the gold standard.
Neither does it require the substitution of national currencies,
as happened in the EMU. But it represents a first step toward
a world monetary union because it can allow the overcoming
of the so-called inconsistent triad, limiting the powers of
national central banks, especially if the agreement is sanctioned
by an international treaty and aWorld Council of Central Banks
is set up. Because every national bank is bound to maintain a
common inflation rate, the interest rates will converge and the
exchange rate should remain fairly stable. Of course, a serious
financial crisis cannot be fully avoided, as in the case of exces-
sive national public debts (like the Greek crisis). But the cre-
ation of an effective unified monetary market can greatly
reduce the risk of international investments, mainly in emerg-
ing economies, and the need for international reserves.
Other parallel steps in the fields of finance and fiscal poli-
cies should follow the creation of a world monetary union,
as said before. Here, we limit ourselves to stressing how the
supranational perspective can also change the cultural frame-
work on the debate concerning the relationships between mar-
ket and state. In his survey on fiscal federalism, Oates observed,
The essence of such systems is a combination of fiscal
and market institutions that provides a set of incen-
tives to individual agents for efficient behaviour. A
relatively decentralized public sector, characterized by
competition among jurisdictions in a setting of a com-
mon market without barriers to trade, can provide a
powerful inducement for public decision makers to
behave in ways that promote the welfare of their con-
stituencies and sustain the efficient performance of
private markets. (Oates, 2008, p. 183)
In a centralized state, the market is usually conceived in
opposition to state power. But the welfare of the citizens
depends neither on the market alone nor on the public sector
alone. For this reason, the theory of market fundamentalism
is wrong, and so is the theory of state fundamentalism, as the
Chinese have well understood. A global market can provide
greater welfare to all citizens and peoples of the world only
if it is conceived not as an end in itself but as a means to
provide more international justice, more economic stability,
and a clean environment. A new macroeconomic theory, if
supported by efficient supranational institutions, can greatly
contribute to providing these global public goods.
