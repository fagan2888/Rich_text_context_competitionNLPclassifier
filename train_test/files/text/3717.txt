Introduction
According to the World Internet Project (WIP), going online
greatly increases contact with people sharing common inter-
ests. Blogging is part of the Internet culture of young Swedish
women. Among females between the ages of 16 and 25, two
of three actively write or have written a blog, and three of
four read other people's blogs (Cole et al., 2013). Blogging is
a way of reaching out and entering into contact with readers
who can gain insights into the blogger's life-world (Heilferty,
2011). Many blogs deal with the experiences of living with
some form of ill health. An illness blog is an online expres-
sion of the narrative of illness, as well as a means for provid-
ing and receiving information, ideas, and emotions between
persons, united in the story of illness. Blogging can help sick
persons manage and cope with the uncertainty and identity
changes accompanying their illness (Heilferty, 2011).
Writing blogs provides a means for expressing one's views
and thoughts, and for providing a picture of one's everyday
life: "as the voice of the author, blogs have the potential to
clarify previously misunderstood perceptions of treatments,
the impact of patient-provider interactions, and of living with
potentially stigmatizing illnesses" (Heilferty, 2011, p. 354).
According to Bruns (2008), bloggers can be defined as pro-
dusagers, as they both produce and use blog texts. A number
of studies of websites focusing on eating disorders have been
conducted (Davis, 2008; Dias, 2003; Heilferty, 2011;
Lipczynska, 2007; Mulveen & Hepworth, 2006; Norris,
Boydell, Pinhas, & Katzman, 2006).
Anorexia reduces a woman's self-esteem due to her unre-
alistic perception or denial of her weight, body shape, and
amenorrhea (American Psychiatric Association, 2006).
Common causes of anorexia are dysfunctional family rela-
tionships, slimming, stress, and frustration (Tozzi, Sullivan,
Fear, McKenzie, & Bulik, 2003). Anorexia patients describe
their experiences in terms of the illness taking over their life.
The illness affects the family, and relationships, including
friends, disappear (Colton & Pistrang, 2004). Patients with
anorexia often avoid closeness, which in turn can lead to iso-
lation (Jackman, 2009).
Being cared for together with other persons with anorexia
in an in-patient ward is experienced as both positive and nega-
tive. Support from other patients can be of an emotional and

Writing Oneself Back Into Life

Abstract
The aim of this study was to describe how young women living with self-identified anorexia narrate about their lives by
blogging. Thirteen Swedish blogs were chosen and analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis. The results described
falling ill, the illness itself, and the path to recovery. Low self-esteem, depressed state of mind, and self-destructive behavior
were typical signs at the start of the illness. The women's lives were characterized by a need for controlling their body by
tormenting it and by the illness demanding all their concentration and energy. The women suffered from the feeling of being
a disappointment to their family members. The illness was like an enemy that had to be defeated with the help of family
members, health care professionals, and by means of therapy. A turning point occurred when the women felt at their worst
or had tired of the illness and could concentrate on something other than their body and the eating disorder. Suffering from
self-identified anorexia was described as experiencing low self-esteem. The illness took all of the women's time and energy.
For a turning point to be reached, the women needed support from family, friends, and health care professionals, including
the use of distractions.

practical nature, as they can share their experiences, and fel-
low patients can serve as role models . van Ommen,
Meerwijk, Kars, van Elburg, and van Meijel (2009) believe
that the alliance between psychiatric nurse and patient
depends on the nurse being involved, clear, persistent,
dependable, and accessible.
Agood patient­psychiatric nurse alliance can be crucial for
successful therapy (Button & Warren, 2001), where empathy,
sympathetic understanding, listening, and recognizing the
patient's needs can be of vital importance for recovery.
However, it has been found that some nurses feel that the
patients have caused the illness and should therefore be able to
deal with it themselves (Ramjan, 2004). King and Turner
(2000) reported that nurses are suspicious of and find it diffi-
cult to understand patients exhibiting anorectic behavior. They
found that when nurses are given the opportunity to reflect
over their care actions, the nurses tend to change their attitude
and become more understanding of the patient's illness.
Recovery is achieved when patients receive help bolster-
ing their motivation and working through their emotions
generally (Federici & Kaplan, 2008). Other important factors
are social support, for example, having a supportive partner,
receiving therapy and counseling, and being recognized as
individuals with specific needs (Federici & Kaplan, 2008;
Tozzi et al., 2003). Colton and Pistrang (2004) found that
normalization, structure, and responsibility are aspects con-
tributing to recovery. Aspects shown to have a negative
influence on recovery are competing and comparing oneself
with others in terms of slimness and learning new destructive
behaviors from others (Ramjan, 2004).
A delay from recovery can be due to a relapse caused by
ambivalence in terms of the will to recover, dissatisfaction
with the therapy, or not being adequately prepared for life
after therapy. Lack of social support, inability to manage
emotions, poor self-esteem, and difficulties relating to fam-
ily and friends expecting the patient to become free of the
illness can also lead to relapse (Federici & Kaplan, 2008;
Tozzi et al., 2003; van Ommen et al., 2009).
Theoretical Framework
The life-world perspective makes it possible to gain under-
standing of a human being's everyday life by describing and
analyzing the world on the basis of human experiences
(Dahlberg, 2011). Philosopher Husserl highlighted "life-
world" as a scientific concept. It was developed by Heidegger
as a "human being-in-world." Merleau-Ponty considered it a
"being-to-world" and incorporated the theory of the lived
body, meaning that people have access to the world through
the body as a unified whole (Dahlberg, 2011; Toadvine &
Embree, 2002; Young, 2003). According to Merleau-Ponty, a
prerequisite for knowledge development is awareness and
understanding of the life-world as the lived world, where we
seek the meaning and content of life (Dahlberg, 2011). In the
present study, a life-world perspective implies a turn toward
the lived existence of women with an eating disorder to
understand how they perceive their illness and suffering and
how it influences their lives. The life-world is both unique to
each individual and shared with others. One's own body can
never be relinquished and encompasses the person's lived
experiences, memories, and impressions. The body is the
medium through which we comprehend the world around us
and which conveys knowledge about the individual person to
that world. Illness changes the life-world, as nothing can be
taken for granted any more (Dahlberg, 2011). Similar to per-
son-centered care (PCC), the life-world perspective empha-
sizes that an ill human being is a subject and not merely a
disease (Dahlberg & Segesten, 2010), and that his or her con-
text and cultural needs should be taken into account (Ekman
et al., 2011).
According to Eastham (2011), "blogs are unsolicited nar-
ratives that offer a naturalistic entrée into the illness experi-
ence unconstrained by time" (p. 353). A blog is a web page
consisting of posts that appear in reverse chronological order
and is ideally updated on a frequent basis (Kozinets,
Hemetsberger, & Schau, 2008).
Blogs generally offer readers an opportunity to respond,
provide author information, and offer links to other sites
(Eastham, 2011; Hookway, 2013). Today, social lives on the
Internet and in the real world have merged. Technology is
used to communicate, socialize, express, and understand
(Kozinets et al., 2008). The shift from verbal narrative to writ-
ten language can be regarded as a shift from "orality to liter-
acy" and may be compared with the postmodern "shift within
language" (Ong, 1982).According to Heilferty (2011), written
narratives on blogs can provide important knowledge about
what health and suffering mean. Internet is the platform where
blogs with narratives can be found, and a defining characteris-
tic of illness blogs is the blogger's unique "from-me-to-the-
world" perspective (Heilferty, 2011). Winer (2003) considers a
blog to be the "unedited voice of a single person" (http://blogs.
law.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog).
Posting narrative blogs is a more symmetric type of shar-
ing, as the traditional power relationship between patient and
professional carer does not exist. Meyrowitz (in Marwick,
2013) claims that the boundaries between the "back and front
regions" of a narrative are beginning to become blurred in
line with the development of media use. The back regions
represent that which is private and where you can expose
your emotions and problems, whereas the front regions
embody the presentation of a more controlled behavior.
Blogs represent a kind of diary where the reader can post
comments and the Internet eliminates many of the prerequi-
sites necessary for the creation of relationships, such as
knowing who the others are and how to contact them, which
are key aspects when encountering a person face to face
(Eastham, 2011; Marwick, 2013). However, the absence of
these prerequisites on the Internet can also make certain
Dahlborg Lyckhage et al. 3
interactions more difficult as it allows people to alter their
identity and be the persons they wish to be (Marwick, 2013).
Links to other blogs and comments from readers provide
communication within the cyberspace social community,
thus turning bloggers into produsagers (Bruns, 2008). How
people with self-identified anorexia write about their life on
blogs has not been studied sufficiently. Only a few studies
have been conducted in Sweden despite the fact that many
people use the Internet for blogging. Narratives of illness can
provide a deeper understanding about thoughts and emotions
between persons, brought together in the story of illness.
Sharing of the blog content provides an opportunity to gain
knowledge about how persons with eating disorders can
relate their illness to their life-world. Therefore, the aim of
the present study was to describe how young women living
with self-identified anorexia narrate about their lives by
means of blogging.
Method
Blogs, Facebook, and chat rooms are similar in that they
offer researchers the ability to observe and/or participate in
textual conversations. However, they differ in terms of access
and communication: Some blogs require readers to sign in or
register, whereas others may be read simply by clicking the
provided link; chat rooms require users to sign in with a user
name. Blogs are primarily the writings of the blogger,
although a dialogue may develop between the blogger and
readers who choose to comment.
Blogs were selected by searching Google.se for "anorexia
blog" in Swedish (December 6, 2010). Fifty-five blogs per-
taining to anorexia nervosa and eating disorders were identi-
fied. All the 55 blogs were read to gain a general impression
of the material. After that the blogs who did not meet the
inclusion criterias were put aside. The criteria for being
included in the study were that the blog had to be written by
a young female aged 12 to 25 years and that the blog must
deal exclusively with self-identified anorexia. Thirteen blogs
met these criteria. Blogs meeting the inclusion criteria
between September 1 and December 6 2010 were included in
the study, although their entire content, that is, entries before
and/or after said dates, was included for analysis. In this
study, the analysis object was the individual blogger's con-
tent. Consequently, the interaction between the blogger and
her followers, that is, comments and replies between the par-
ties, were excluded from the analysis. All blogs were treated
confidentially. In the "Results" section, the participants will
be termed bloggers.
Analysis
The narratives were analyzed by means of qualitative content
analysis (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004). The analysis process
comprised the following four steps: (a) Meaning units in the
texts were identified, (b) the meaning units were condensed
and coded, (c) the codes were brought together and sorted
into categories, and (d) themes were developed by interpret-
ing the underlying meanings of the codes and categories. To
offset the possible bias effects of the researchers'prior under-
standing, in the form of theoretical knowledge and personal
experience, on the result of the analysis, the researchers were
acutely aware of the importance of clearly describing the
sampling procedure, participants, data collection, analysis
process, and their own prior understanding to ensure a high
level of rigor (Graneheim & Lundman, 2004).
In practice, three of the researchers (A.G., H.K., and
J.T.M.) first read all the 13 selected blog texts to obtain an
overall understanding of them and highlighted the meaning
units corresponding with the study's aim. Subsequently, the
researchers condensed the meaning units to a higher level of
abstraction, coded them, and brought the codes together into
categories based on differences and similarities. Finally, they
developed sub-themes and themes by interpreting the under-
lying meaning of the categories. The two remaining research-
ers (I.B. and E.D.L.) then validated the results by reviewing
the themes and categories to ensure that they corresponded
with the contents of the empirical data.
Ethical Reflections
The bloggers described self-identified anorexia and shared
their thoughts and reflections on their illness on blogs openly
available to anyone wishing to read them. The individual
posting the blog is responsible for the material published
(Shih-Ming, Hsiu-Li, Su-Houn, & Hsieh, 2010). Merely
reading a blog post offers no form of interaction between
blogger and reader, and the blogger has no ability to deter-
mine who is reading the blog, although there is always a
theoretical possibility to obtain Internet protocol (IP)
addresses and attempt to back-track to the reader. Interaction
only takes place if the blogger and the reader actively engage
in written or verbal conversation. The lack of interaction of a
blog per se meets one criterion for defining the blog's public
nature as laid down by the Swedish Freedom of the Press Act
(SFS 1949:105). Consequently, the bloggers in the present
study were not asked whether they wanted to participate and
thus had no opportunity to decline. However, the blogs were
treated confidentially, and no reference was made to specific
names, although it was sometimes possible to identify quota-
tions. This study was approved by University West's Ethics
Committee.
Results
The blogs dealt with being afflicted and living with anorexia,
overcoming it, and reaching a turning point. Many bloggers
described the blog as a room allowing them to share their life-
world and let others accompany them on "a journey." At
times, the blog was used to alleviate anxiety and communicate
with family and others, as it was an easier communication

channel and dispensed with the need to meet in person. It
constituted a platform for receiving support and inspiration
from others. The bloggers emphasized that they did not want
others to be distressed by what they wrote. Although we did
not analyze the readers' comments and the bloggers' replies
on the blogs, we noted that the bloggers received both posi-
tive and negative comments. The former provided support
and strength, whereas the latter made the bloggers doubt
their strength to continue the struggle.
Being Afflicted With Anorexia
The causes of anorexia were described as self-defeating
behavior, poor self-esteem, and depressed state of mind. A
common characteristic was the feeling of being of less value
than others. Compliments and praise were negatively inter-
preted, and a lack of willingness to become involved in life
was a prominent feature. All the bloggers reported placing
high demands on themselves and suffering from constant
performance anxiety, expressions of which were never feel-
ing satisfied, constantly setting new goals, and striving for
perfection. "If you succeed once, the goals are raised. It
becomes a vicious circle. I think that is where some of it
started, unfortunately."
Living With Anorexia
Living with anorexia was described as being one's body,
being in control over and tormenting one's body, exemplified
by perceptions that the body contained fat that was spilling
over, or that the body was growing. In some blogs, the
women wrote about their anxiety about gaining weight when
body lotion was absorbed by the skin, that biting one's nails
as well as chewing gum could add unwanted calories. They
could experience anxiety and shame over their thin body in
changing rooms with mirrors. "First you want to be thin in
order to be satisfied with and exhibit yourself. But when you
get frightfully thin you hide everything under large tunics
and sweaters. Because then you feel ashamed."
Being in control provided a sense of security, which was
difficult to relinquish due to uncertainty about what would
happen. Control was related to the content and amount of
food, as well as weight, body, and emotions. Loss of control
led to anxiety and feelings of chaos. "I believed that I had
control over food and the eating disorder but the question is
whether that's really the case. It's rather the eating disorder
that's in control."
Living with anorexia implied rapid swings in mood and
thoughts. They could feel both happy and empty, as well as
hate and love the illness, all at the same time. Feelings of
being trapped and wanting to escape were described.
Showing emotions openly was difficult, which made it easier
to shut out feelings than to try to maintain a facade of
normality.
Tormenting oneself was a way of counteracting the pain
caused by anorexia, such as forcing oneself to lie in different
positions to cause pain and create a feeling of worthlessness.
"Every person in the whole world deserves to be happy and
enjoy good health . . . except me. It's an awful feeling."
Cutting oneself; concentrating on other things, such as com-
puter games, blogging, or needlework; vomiting; or perform-
ing extreme physical training relieved the anxiety. "Nothing
cures pain as effectively as pain."
Although conflicts regarding food intake and treatment
existed in the family, being disagreeable led to anxiety, feel-
ings of guilt, and fear of losing one's relatives. It could be
difficult to regain trust after many years of lying and broken
promises. "I don't even have to make an effort anymore; the
lies emerge in a steady stream."
A consequence of the illness was lagging behind with
one's school work and not meeting school friends. It also
affected the blogger's leisure time; when their friends were
out having a good time, the bloggers were struggling to sur-
vive, which resulted in difficulty knowing what constitutes
normal behavior.
Overcoming the Anorexia: Treatment and
Recovery
In all blogs, anorexia was described as an enemy, a devil, a
monster, or an uninvited guest that one constantly had to
combat. The illness could detect weight gain and "scream"
that you had eaten too much, thereby rendering any sense of
well-being impossible. Being rewarded by the anorexia
made the struggle more difficult. "If you go along with the
anorexia it will give you a hug." Fighting the illness was a
constant burden requiring all the blogger's strength. It was
described as an exhausting struggle against the self. Fear of
what would happen after weight gain and doubt that they
would accept their new weight made the struggle even more
difficult. However, fighting the negative thoughts could
make the person feel stronger.
Feeling supported by family, friends, partners, therapists,
fellow patients, God, and those who read the blog was impor-
tant. Mothers were perceived as supportive, but in some
cases, support from fathers was non-existent. "I hated Dad
too. He said things that I hated hearing. I was never good
enough in his eyes and he wasn't satisfied with me. Kept
complaining."
Undergoing treatment involved many demanding discus-
sions and different therapists provided contradictory advice.
The young women found the focus on their weight unpleas-
ant and unnatural, especially as nobody asked them how they
felt. They described that as in-patients, they competed to be
the best at cheating staff and learnt from other patients how
to starve themselves. However, descriptions of support
among patients in various phases of the illness also emerged.
The bloggers stated that positive factors for recovery were
encouragement, peace and quiet during meals, rest and relax-
ation, assistance to achieve structure, normalization of activ-
ities, and learning table manners. One way of regaining a
normal body image and getting to know the body again was
Dahlborg Lyckhage et al. 5
moving by means of dance. The bloggers wrote that support-
ive dialogues with one and the same therapist were important
and that evoking the therapist's voice could help them
remember the different strategies that they had been
instructed to utilize to manage a difficult situation. The fact
that the therapist did not stop believing in them and never
gave up hope inspired a sense of security.
All the bloggers expressed anxiety about the weighing
procedure; both weight gain and weight loss were reasons for
concern. Being able to influence how, when, and where the
weighing would take place was mentioned as being impor-
tant. Undressing in front of another person could be experi-
enced as a vulnerable and violating situation. "I'm aware
that my anorexia has deteriorated since I first learnt how
much I weigh . . . Weight is one's worst enemy when suffering
from an eating disorder."
Many of the bloggers lacked knowledge of how to regain
health although they believed that it was possible.
Reaching a Turning Point
The turning point could occur at a particular point in time or
be a drawn-out process. The change could happen when they
felt at their worst or when they were tired of the illness and
all its negative consequences. One young woman wrote that
she was curious about leading a healthy life. "I'm tired of
living a life without life."
The anorexia turned into something that was no longer
desirable. Finding motivation was difficult but important. It
could take the form of determination to study, work, have
children, or quite simply to be free, happy, and experience a
feeling of fellowship, although trusting oneself and others
and letting go of the illness were challenging. "You can't
trust yourself but the problem is that's the only thing you do,
as you refuse to trust others, but if you want to become
healthy you have to trust others."
Recovery involved a fear of being abandoned, difficulty
assuming responsibility, and a wish to continue to be taken
care of. Reassuming the responsibility that had been taken
away during the illness was not easy. Furthermore, they had
to learn to think about other things to divert their thoughts
from the illness, such as dancing, going for walks, and shop-
ping. Other methods for distraction were using their sense of
humor or intoxicating themselves with alcohol. However, the
anorectic thoughts returned when they were not otherwise
occupied.
Discussion
The aim of the present study was to describe how young
women living with self-identified anorexia narrate about
their lives by blogging. Reading the blogs made it possible to
follow the young women's emotional ups and downs. Writing
a blog enabled the bloggers to reveal aspects of themselves
that they feel unable to disclose in face-to-face encounters
with nurses or therapists, where they feel they have to keep
up appearances and their mask intact. They wrote about
being unable to show their emotions and that their sense of
loneliness increases despite being surrounded by many sup-
portive persons. As blogs primarily are writings of the blog-
ger, dialogue is not the primary motivation of the blogger,
although dialogue may develop between the blogger and
readers. We believe this may be relevant to take into account
when considering to what extent an eating disorder may be
exacerbated by various comments. According to Rains
(2014), anonymity as a blogger may help mitigate the effects
of a potential exacerbation and facilitate ongoing illness-
related self-disclosure.
The bloggers' emotions give rise to confusion, and they
are uncertain as to what constitutes normal behavior. The
blogs revealed that they want to be seen as the person they
are and not for their illness. A study of in-patients with
anorexia demonstrated that treatment improves their self-
esteem (Karpowicz, Skarsater, & Nevonen, 2009).
Consequently, enhanced self-esteem in women with anorexia
is crucial for recovery. Telling stories is a human activity, but
illness can be seen as a disruption of the story for both the
one who is ill and for the caregiver (Frank, 1995). PCC
means a shift away from a model in which the patient is the
passive target of a medical intervention to a more contractual
arrangement involving the patient as an active participant in
his care and the decision-making process (Ekman et al.,
2011; Federici & Kaplan, 2008).
Their struggle with their bodies and emotions during the
various phases became clear. The emotions drained so much
energy that it is difficult for them to be present in the here
and now. The anorexia constitutes a changed and in many
ways bizarre life-world, where they are trapped in a body
fighting against the own self, a struggle demanding all the
women's time and energy. Their life-world is closely related
to their bodies; they encounter life through their bodies
(Young, 2003), and at the hospital, they must confront the
sick body. An important part of the treatment is weighing.
Undressing in front of a nurse can give rise to anxiety and
feelings of being violated, both when they have gained and
lost weight.
The narratives made it clear that the young women feel an
existential break in relation to self. The anorexia breaks the
trajectory of life and creates a fracture in their lived bodies.
In the blogs, destructive behaviors were described as a way
of alleviating the mental pain, which is in line with previous
findings (Federici & Kaplan, 2008; Skarderud, 2007). In the
initial phase, the treatment increases the patient's stress and
can trigger strong emotions, which represent a challenge to
the psychiatric nurse who can sometimes be perceived as
heartless and frustrated (Federici & Kaplan, 2008). Seeing
the self-harm, the scars caused by knife wounds, and the thin
bodies created by the young women and their friend and foe,
anorexia can be distressing for the nurse (Snell, Crowe, &
Jordan, 2010). A process of bodily breakdown can also cause
6 SAGE Open
anxiety, fear, and disgust in health care professionals. Both
Rudge and Holmes (2010) and Lindahl (2011) used the
Kristevian concept of abjection to describe the body when it
is in a state of disruption and decay that threatens its physical
boundaries.
The lives of the women encompass both endurance and
uncertainty. Sometimes, they feel abandoned, both by the ill-
ness and by their partners, friends, and families. It was evi-
dent from the blogs that the illness puts a strain on these
different relationships. Similar to our findings, studies have
indicated that individuals, including relatives, can distance
themselves from the anorectic person (Button & Warren,
2001; Jackman, 2009). However, we also found that family,
friends, partners, care staff, psychiatric nurses, fellow
patients, and others constitute a significant source of support,
which corresponds with other studies (Federici & Kaplan,
2008; Nilsson & Hägglöf, 2006). One prerequisite for recov-
ery is development of the therapeutic relationship, which
among other things can be achieved by the psychiatric nurse
sharing knowledge, for example, by providing the patient
with information about anorexia and its consequences (van
Ommen et al., 2009). Knowledge about what happens to the
body during the illness can reduce the patient's inner resis-
tance to treatment (Snell et al., 2010).
Systematic use of blogs in therapeutic encounters with
these young women can be a means of strengthening them in
their recovery and overcoming their guarded attitude about
their illness. Listening to the patient's narrative is one of the
cornerstones of PCC (Ekman et al., 2011). Blogging can
serve as an alternative to personal talks, as many of these
young women have difficulty talking about their emotions. A
study by Pettersen, Thune-Larsen, Wynn, and Rosenvinge
(2013) revealed important challenges in terms of exploring
identity, relearning eating, and developing social skills as
well as coping with grief, which we believe can be achieved
by means of systematic work with blogs. The blog enables
the nurse to understand that the women need to be able to cry
and make their vulnerability visible, as well as understand
the women's important need to be strong and brave despite
feeling powerless in relation to the illness destroying their
body.
Having the opportunity to state their wishes regarding
how the weighing should be performed contributes to the
young women feeling involved and makes it easier for them
to endure. Other aspects of the treatment described as posi-
tive in the blogs were relaxation, rest, and tranquility.
The young women feel that they are left with too much
responsibility due to their choice to start eating. This can be
understood in the light of the theories of being and nothing-
ness by existential philosophers such as Sartre and Merleau-
Ponty (Meyers, 2008). The concept of liminality has been
used to designate a process (Little, Jordens, Paul,
Montgomery, & Philipson, 1998) as well as a way of being
after becoming ill with a serious disease (Navon & Morag,
2004). It can also be understood as an ambiguous space
between being healthy and being sick (Syme, 2011). The
bloggers narrated how their liminality manifests itself in
everyday life and how they try to organize a self that con-
nects with the liminal space. For these women, being in a
liminal space is about balancing demands, both from the ill-
ness itself and from those around them. In different daily life
situations, they adjust their self-image and stretch their limits
by means of forbidden thoughts, lies, and self-harm. Previous
research has demonstrated that a person with anorexia makes
a pact with the illness, which can be called a friend and a foe,
thus allowing it to gain full control over the person's life and
body (Skarderud, 2007; Treasure & Schmidt, 2001), which
was also described in the blogs in the present study.
The young women in our study repeatedly doubted that
recovery was possible. Federici and Kaplan (2008) described
that the recovery process demands vigilance and persistence.
Nilsson and Hägglöf (2006) found that all persons suffering
from anorexia in their study were able to remember or
describe the turning point that constituted the start of their
recovery process. The blogs revealed that motivation is
important for recovery and can involve educating oneself
and/or becoming pregnant. Talking to parents, friends, and
partners about one's emotions can also be beneficial. Thus,
individuals with anorexia need support to be able to endure
their emotions and learn to cope with and verbalize them.
Pettersen et al. (2013) outlined important challenges in terms
of exploring one's identity, relearning eating, and developing
social skills as well as coping with grief. The bloggers
described fear of the future as hindering recovery and that
the sense of security provided by the anorexia is alluring.
According to Federici and Kaplan (2008), those who have
recovered from anorexia exhibit a realistic view of obstacles,
whereas those who have suffered a relapse consider that the
hard work was behind them and have difficulty envisaging
obstacles. In our study, a barrier to recovery was the fear of
being abandoned. Pettersen et al. (2013) suggested that the
concept of recovery as a linear development of increasing
well-being and reduction of symptoms should be questioned.
The closer one gets to recovery from an eating disorder, the
more challenges emerge at psychological and existential lev-
els. Consequently, patients in the later stages of recovery
may need professional treatment or counseling when the
impact of their eating disorder symptoms is reduced. Even if
the Internet and blogging do not provide a solution, they
introduce new possibilities for leveraging visibility to learn
from and reach out to those who live with an eating disorder
(Boyd, Ryan, & Leavitt, 2010).
Practical Implications of This Study
Systematic use of blogs in therapeutic encounters with these
young women can be a means of strengthening them in their
recovery and overcoming their guarded attitude about their
illness. Blogging can provide an alternative to personal talks,
as many of these women have difficulties in talking about
Dahlborg Lyckhage et al. 7
their emotions. Reading the blog narrative of a young woman
with anorexia nervosa can make it easier for the nurse to pro-
vide more PCC. However, considering bloggers' frequent
desire for anonymity, nurses may be limited to reading ano-
rectic patients' blogs in general.
Limitations of the Study
When analyzing blog texts, you can always question the
truthfulness of the blogger. A blogger may blur the frontiers
between truth, reality, and fantasy. According to Gavin,
Rodham, and Poyer (2008), blogs are forums that provide
important support for the bloggers. Blogs permit an exchange
of information, ideas, and emotions, united in the story of an
illness experience (Heilferty, 2011).
Some believe that the blog format, as against, for instance,
that of Facebook, reduces the risk of comments that can
worsen the disease (Eastham, 2011). Others believe that an
illness blog can have the power to trigger the disease (Norris
et al., 2006). In our study, we excluded the interaction
between the blog posts, the comments from readers, and the
blogger's replies, so our results cannot contribute to either
confirm or refute these claims.
Conclusion
The blogs reflect a process from falling ill to the turning
point where the will to recover is strong. This process can be
understood as being between illness and health, and the blogs
described how the young women's lives were transformed
and how they fought to control the illness. However, they
were still unable to change their anorectic behavior and
remained in liminality. Blogging can be seen as "resistance"
to norms about the female body, and being able to offer such
resistance requires a certain degree of freedom and self-effi-
cacy. The ability to write blogs indicates a kind of freedom
that can generate a sense of being good enough, thereby lead-
ing to enhanced self-esteem. Blogging can be a way of allow-
ing oneself to be ill, thus eliminating the guilt experienced by
the young women in relation to the illness and finding moti-
vation to recover.
