Abstract
The aim was to develop a new instrument for measuring length of sleep as well as television and computer habits in school-age
children. A questionnaire was constructed for use when children visit the school health care unit. Three aspects of the validity
of the questionnaire were examined: its face validity, content validity, and construct validity. Test­retest reliability was
assessed by giving the questionnaire twice, 2 weeks apart, to the respondents. The questionnaire was assessed as being rea-
sonably valid, the test­retest results (n ¼ 138) showing 90.4% of the estimates regarding bedtime on weeknights on the two
survey occasions to lie within + 30 min of each other, the test­retest agreement also being rather close (k > .600) regarding
both sleep and media habits. The instrument can be a valuable tool in a clinical setting, both for measuring sleep habits in a class
and for discussing sleep with individual school children and their families.

Background
School health programs aim at promoting healthy lifestyles,
including healthy sleep habits. All school children in Swe-
den are provided the possibility of an individual visit to the
school health care unit every 3 years, a school nurse discuss-
ing matters of health with them at the time, their height and
weight also being measured then (Clausson, 2008). Sleep
problems in children have been found to have increased
in recent years, lack of sleep being one of the most common
complaints of children and adolescents today (Bremberg,
2006). Sleep problems in childhood appear to be a possible
indicator of later risk of neuropsychological difficulties
(Gregory, Caspi, Moffitt, & Poulton, 2009), such as those
involving depression (Gregory, Rijsdijk, Lau, Dahl, &
Eley, 2009), anxiety, and aggression (Gregory, Van der
Ende, Willis, & Verhulst, 2008). Nevertheless, the avail-
ability of clinical sleep-diagnostic and treatment services
for children is generally inadequate in most countries,
including Sweden (Owens, 2005). In order to have an ade-
quate basis for providing children advice regarding their
sleeping problems, reliable information on their sleeping
habits and on factors that influence their length of sleep are
called for. There was the need of a questionnaire suitable
for use in a school health care setting for children with
and without sleep problems that could provide a basis for
discussions during health care visit.
One problem connected with many existing question-
naires is of their being designed primarily for use in diagnos-
ing serious sleeping difficulties that are clinical in character,
rather than for studying differences in children's sleep habits
generally. Another problem is the length of questionnaires.
In the present study, the suitability of a new, short question-
naire was investigated. The questionnaire is designed so that
school nurses can distribute it to school children at the time
of their ordinary school health care visits. Development of
the questionnaire was inspired by various other sleep-
evaluation scales and questionnaires (Lomeli et al., 2008).
Several of the existing questionnaires, specifically the
School Sleep Habits Survey (Wolfson & Carskadon,
1998), the Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (Mindell &

Owens, 2003), the National Sleep Foundation Questionnaire
(2006), and the Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire
(Owens, Spirito, & McGuinn, 2000), were found to be rather
time-consuming, each of them several pages long. For the
purpose of guiding an interview leading to health counsel-
ing, what was needed was a short, easy-to-use questionnaire
that children above a certain age could readily fill out and
parents of younger children could complete on their child's
behalf. The instrument employed is a further development of
an earlier 10-item questionnaire developed for use in a pilot
study conducted in 2007­2008 of the length of sleep and of
the television and computer habits of primary school chil-
dren (Garmy, 2011).
Aim
The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate the
validity and reliability of a new instrument for measuring
both the length of sleep and the television and computer
habits of children of school age.
Method
The study has a psychometric, cross-sectional design.
Approval of the study was obtained from the head principal
of each school and from the school's head physician.
Respondents were told that participation was voluntary and
those participating gave their informed consent. The study
was also reviewed by the Advisory Committee on Research
Ethics in Health Education (VEN 34-09).
The Questionnaire
A questionnaire (see Appendix A) consisting of 11 questions
was constructed. The questions pertained to eight variables
concerning sleep as well as possible effects of lack of sleep,
and also to TV and computer habits (length of sleep on
weeknights and on weekends, time for getting ready for bed,
time of going to bed, amount of time spent watching televi-
sion and at the computer). There were four questions regard-
ing problems related to sleeping habits and their possible
effects such as difficulties in falling asleep, difficulties in
waking up, experiencing feeling tired at school, and enjoy-
ment of school. Although asking the time the child got up
on weekdays and weekends, and went to bed on weekends,
would have provided a certain check on the child's estimates
of hours slept, these questions were not asked, due to the aim
of keeping the questionnaire brief. The questionnaire was
constructed for use at the regular, individual school health
care visits children have while in the preschool class (age
6), as well as in grades 1 (age 7), 4 (age 10), and 8 (age
14) and in the first upper secondary school grade (age 16).
For children in the preschool class or in grade 1, admin-
istration of the questionnaire took place during the child's
first health care visit at school, when one of the parents or
both came with their child to the school health care unit
and filled out the questionnaire on the child's behalf. For
children in grades 4 and 8 and in upper secondary school,
it involved the pupils filling out the questionnaire them-
selves during a school health care visit. The present ques-
tionnaire was developed initially on the basis of a review
of pediatric literature on sleep and was inspired by earlier
sleep questionnaires developed by Wolfson and Carskadon
(1998), Mindell and Owens (2003), Sadeh (2004), Nordlund,
Norberg, Lennerena
¨s, Gillberg, and Pernler (2004), and the
National Sleep Foundation (2006). The instrument is also
a further development of the 10-item questionnaire used in
the pilot study referred to. Regarding the reliability of the
10-item questionnaire, results of the two separate testing
conducted were found to correspond rather closely with one
another (Garmy, 2011).
Data Collection
The questionnaires were distributed by six school nurses in
eight schools during 2008­2009. The school nurses, each
with more than 4 years of experience in school health care,
were informed both in writing and orally that they should be
sensitive in their approach and not try to persuade any of the
potential respondents to participate. The respondents were
told that there were no right or wrong answers, that it was
a question of what they themselves thought.
Sample and Setting
The study, which was part of a larger study concerned with
children attending the preschool class, grades 1, 4, and 8, and
grade 1 in upper secondary school (n ¼ 4692), was con-
ducted in a municipality in southern Sweden of about
100,000 inhabitants. About 17% of the population there was
born abroad, the unemployment rate was 2.4%, and 1.6% of
the populace received welfare payments (Sva
¨rd & Nilsson,
2009). There are 44 schools in the municipality. Eight of
these were selected randomly for inclusion in the study. The
sample taken consisted of 160 respondents. The sample size
was based on the recommendations of Fleiss (1986), that is,
that 15­20 subjects would be required for estimating the
reliability of a quantitative variable. There were 116 child
respondents (32 being pupils in grade 4, 31 pupils in grade
8, and 31 pupils in first grade in upper secondary school) and
44 parent respondents whose children were in the preschool
class or grade 1, 138 of them having filled out the question-
naire on both occasions on which it was given, 2 weeks
apart. Fifty-three percent of those in the sample were girls
(n ¼ 73). Twenty-two of the respondents only answered the
questionnaire once. For the pupils in grades 4 and 8 and the
first upper secondary school grade, the reasons for failure to
fill out the questionnaire the second time were either their
being absent the second time the questionnaire was distrib-
uted (n ¼ 7) or a lack of desire to participate then (n ¼ 2),
and for 13 of the parents of children in the preschool class
or in grade 1 it was failure to fill out and return the second

questionnaire. Cases in which the questionnaire was not
filled out the second time (whether by the children them-
selves or their parents) were found to not differ from the
remaining cases in terms of the age and gender of the chil-
dren, or of geographic location.
Tests of Validity
Three aspects of the validity of the questionnaire were exam-
ined: its face validity, its content validity, and its construct
validity. Validity refers to the degree to which an instrument
measures what it is supposed to measure, face validity to the
extent to which an instrument appears valid to those who use
it, content validity to the extent to which a measure repre-
sents all facets of the content area being assessed, and con-
struct validity to the degree to which a survey or test score
correlates with some related measure (Polit & Beck, 2006;
Streiner & Norman, 2003). The face validity of the instru-
ment was evaluated, for the children who filled out the ques-
tionnaire themselves, by asking all of them, both orally and
in writing, to comment on the questionnaire, and urging
them to write down their comments on it. The time taken for
completing the questionnaire was also noted. In addition, the
content validity of the questionnaire was evaluated by letting
an expert group consisting of four persons review and com-
ment on the questionnaire. One of them had more than 10
years of experience as a registered nurse working with chil-
dren and had been a school nurse for 7 years, another had
more than 20 years of experience in the development and
psychometric analysis of test instruments, and the remaining
two persons had considerable experience in connection with
use of sleep medicine.
The construct validity, the association between the
length of sleep and feelings of being tired at school, as well
as difficulties in sleeping, were assessed using the chi-
square test. The length of sleep the children had was dichot-
omized so as to form two groups: those sleeping less than
the median for their grade (short sleep) and those sleeping
longer. The median length of sleep per night was 10 hr at
the age of both 6 and 10, 8 hr at the age of 14, and 71
=2 hr
at the age of 16.
Test of Reliability
The reliability of the questionnaire was tested by giving the
respondents (n ¼ 138) the same questionnaire twice within a
2-week period. This made it possible to evaluate the test­ret-
est reliability or stability. An assessment of the test's power
indicated 30 individuals in each grade to suffice for accepta-
ble conclusions to be drawn regarding the test's reliability.
Taking account of the fact that sleep and media habits can
fluctuate, it was considered, in line with the expert group's
assessment, that +30 min was a reasonable time span of dif-
ferences between the two time estimates for there to be basic
agreement between them.
Statistical Analysis
The chi-Square test and the Fisher Exact test were used to
identify the association between length of sleep and both
feelings of being tired at school and difficulties in sleeping
(Altman, 1991). Associations with p values of <.05 were
considered statistically significant. Kappa analysis and per-
centage of agreement were both used for assessing the agree-
ment of the two measurements in test­retest terms.
Unweighted Kappa was used for dichotomized variables,
weighted Kappa for ordinal data (Altman, 1991), and per-
centage of agreement for continuous variables. For the
test­retest assessment of sleep length, of bedtime, of time
of getting ready for bed, and of time spent at a television set
or at a computer, that is, of all the variables considered, an
interval of +30 min was considered by the expert group
to represent an acceptable level of agreement. The kappa
values were classified in the manner described by Altman
(1991), such that a value of 0.20 was considered as
``poor,'' 0.21­0.40 as ``fair,'' 0.41­0.60 as ``moderate,''
0.61­0.80 as ``good,'' and 0.81­1.00 as ``very good.'' The
same criteria were used for percentage of agreement. The
statistical analyses were performed using statistical package
for the social sciences (SPSS) version 14.0 (Chicago, IL) and
the VassarStats website for statistical computations (http://
faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/VassarStats.html).
Results
Validity
Face validity. The parents of the children in the preschool
class and of those in grade 1 tended to report no difficulties
in answering the questions on behalf of their children. The
pupils in grades 4 and 8 and in upper secondary school raised
questions of what was meant by getting ready for bed,
whereas none of the parents had such questions. The chil-
dren in grade 4 often needed help in calculating their length
of sleep. Some of the children wrote down the time they
woke up rather than the length of time they slept. The time
taken in filling out the questionnaire was generally about 3­
7 min. The children in grade 4 took the longest time.
Content validity. The expert review of the instrument led to
the development of a version of the questionnaire that also
included two questions regarding stress and self-
confidence since sleep problems are often associated with
stress and low self-efficacy (Bremberg, 2006). The two
questions were ``I feel stressed'' (never, seldom, often, or
every day) and ``I'm pleased with myself'' (every day, often,
seldom). A group of 30 pupils were asked to fill out this
questionnaire. Since all of them answered these two ques-
tions in about the same way, both of the questions were
excluded from further development of the questionnaire.
Another result of the expert review of the test instrument
was that a question specifically concerned with the length
140 The Journal of School Nursing 28(2)
of time the child slept was included in the final questionnaire.
Earlier, only questions about bedtime and the time the child
got up were asked, which only enabled the time the child
spent in bed to be calculated, rather than the length of time the
child slept.
Construct validity. The median length of sleep on
weeknights was 10 hr for the preschool class, as well as for
grades 1 and 4, whereas for grade 8 it was 8 hr, and for the
upper secondary school class considered it was 7 hr and 30
min. Those in each grade sleeping less than the median time
formed a short-sleep group. Being short of sleep was found to
be significantly related to being tired in school (w2 ¼ 6.265,
df ¼ 1, p ¼ .012,) and to having difficulties in sleeping
(w2 ¼ 7.672, df ¼ 1, p ¼ .006).
Reliability
The test­retest results showed a high level of agreement con-
cerning bedtime on weeknights, 90.4% of the answers on the
two testing occasions being within +30 min of each other.
The answers to length of sleep on weeknights also showed a
high degree of concordance, 86.8% within a +30-min inter-
val on the two occasions, see Table 1. All of the continuous
variables (bedtime, time for getting ready for bed, length
of sleep on weeknights and on weekends, and time spent
watching television or at the computer) showed reasonable-
to-excellent agreement (63.8­90.4% agreement). The Kappa
and weighted Kappa values for having bedroom TV, having
difficulties in falling asleep, feeling tired in school, having
difficulties in waking up, and enjoying school showed
reasonable-to-excellent agreement according to methods
described by Altman (1991) (see Table 2).
Discussion
Sleep is a fundamental need in terms of human health and is
thus an obvious area for school health care. The availability of
a reliable and valid instrument to screen students' sleeping
habits and the time spent on TV and computer is valuable. For
one thing, it provides a unique entry point for a conversation
regarding sleep and media habits of pupils at individual visits.
In addition, it gives the school nurse a tool to use in identify-
ing sleep habits in a class or in a school district.
The questionnaire was validated in terms of face validity,
content validity, and construct validity. Regarding face
validity, the questionnaire was found to be easy both to
understand and to fill out with two exceptions. Children in
grade 4 often needed help in calculating the length of time
they slept, and many of the children, regardless of their
age, had difficulties in understanding what getting ready for
bed stands for. School nurses found the questionnaire valu-
able in providing an opportunity to discuss sleep hygiene
with the pupils. Construct validity was assessed in terms
of the degree of association between stated sleep length and
answers to questions about being tired in school and having
difficulties in sleeping. In both cases, the association was
found to be highly significant, clearly supporting the con-
struct validity of the test.
Close agreement was obtained in the test­retest compar-
ison of the questionnaire results for length of sleep and for
bedtime on weekday nights. The agreement was somewhat
less but was still rather close for length of sleep and bedtime
on weekend nights, which is rather understandable in view
of weekends usually being less rigidly scheduled than week-
days are. The questionnaire showed a high degree of reliabil-
ity regarding difficulties in waking up and bedroom TV. The
other questions, concerning sleeping difficulties, feelings of
tiredness at school and enjoying school, showed a reason-
ably close agreement (Altman, 1991).
Limitations
One potential drawback to the results is that the schools
selected cannot be assumed to adequately represent the pop-
ulation of Sweden generally. However, the random selection

of eight schools in different socioeconomic areas of the city
in question does serve to counteract this weakness some-
what. Although some of the percentages of agreement and
kappa values are lower than others, we can see no linear
trend reflective of age differences in the test­retest
responses. The answers of the pupils to the questionnaire
showed a slightly lower degree of stability than the answers
to the questionnaires by parents, yet the instrument seems to
function relatively well for all the grades that were involved.
There is a clear advantage in employing a short and easy-
to-use instrument in a clinical setting, although this does
involve limitations, since the short length of the question-
naire makes it impossible to examine all aspects of the sleep
habits and of the television and computer habits, as well as
habits of other sorts that could be of interest related to sleep.
Stress and lack of self-confidence, for example, represented
here by the questions ``I feel stressed'' (never, seldom, often
or every day) and ``I'm pleased with myself'' (every day,
often, seldom), respectively, have been shown to be associ-
ated with sleeping difficulties (Bremberg, 2006). The focus
of the present study and the breadth of the test instrument
were necessarily limited. Investigating sleep habits in
greater depth and studying other variables that contribute
to sleep would require use of a longer instrument. The use
of cellular phones by adolescents for text messaging and for
calling after lights are out is prevalent and readily increases
the degree of tiredness of many adolescents (Van den Bulck,
2007), yet is not examined here. Despite the limitations of
the present instrument, the evaluation of its validity and
reliability points to its being a potentially valuable tool in
a clinical setting.
School Nursing Implications
School nurses should obviously continue their important
work of promoting healthy lifestyles in children, including
healthy sleep habits and healthy TV and computer habits.
Regarding sleep, a first step that a school nurse should take
is to teach children with sleep problems, and their families as
well, sound sleep habits through emphasizing the need of
maintaining a regular and consistent sleep schedule and bed-
time routine, having the child's bedroom conducive to
sleep--dark, cool, and quiet--keeping TV and computers
out of the child's bedroom, and avoiding the child consum-
ing caffeine (Mindell & Owens, 2003; National Sleep foun-
dation 2006; Zarcone, 2002). Our screening questionnaire
provides a point of entry for conversations with the children
or with the parents regarding the sleep and media habits. If
sleep problems are noted, it is important that the family be
involved. Use of both a sleep diary and a questionnaire hav-
ing more detailed questions than those involved here can be
desirable. Judith Owens' Children's Sleep Habits Question-
naire (Owens et al., 2000) is an example of an instrument
containing further questions regarding sleep habits. If prob-
lems persist, the child should see a doctor to rule out possible
medical causes of insomnia or daytime sleepiness. Note that
sleep apnea associated with snoring can also occur in school
children.
Conclusions
The questionnaire shows rather close test­retest agreement
regarding having sleeping difficulties, having bedroom TV,
feelings of tiredness at school, enjoying school, and having
difficulties in waking up. It also showed a reasonable level
of reliability for length of sleep, bedtime, time for getting
ready for bed, and time spent either watching television or
at the computer. School nurses found that the questionnaire
was a help in opening up a discussion with pupils regarding
their sleep habits. Parents and school children alike found the
questionnaire to be easy to fill out. It appears that the instru-
ment could be a valuable tool in a clinical sense, both for mea-
suring sleep habits and for discussing matters of sleep with
individual school children and their families.
