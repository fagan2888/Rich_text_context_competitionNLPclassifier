PERSONALITY traits have emerged in recent years as
predictors of important health outcomes (Hampson &
Friedman, 2008). For example, high neuroticism and low
conscientiousness are each associated with earlier mortal-
ity (Friedman et al., 1993; Wilson, Mendes de Leon, Bienas,
Evans, & Bennett, 2004). However, a small number of re-
cent studies demonstrated that not only does personality
level predict key health outcomes but so does personality
change (Roberts & Mroczek, 2008). Prior studies high-
light the importance of considering both trait level and
change to predict outcomes as diverse as substance abuse
(Hampson, Tildesley, Andrews, Luckyx, & Mroczek,
2010), obesity (Siegler et al., 2003), and mortality (Mroczek
& Spiro, 2007). No study, however, has used a large na-
tional sample with a wide age range to examine whether
both personality level and change predict health outcomes.
In the present study, we extend the findings of these prior
investigations using the Midlife in the U.S. (MIDUS) sur-
vey, a large national longitudinal sample of adult Ameri-
cans to determine whether personality trait level and
change independently predict three distinct self-reported
health outcomes.
Background
Personality Trait Level and Physical Health
A burgeoning literature documents a link between per-
sonality trait level and health (Hampson & Friedman, 2008;
Smith, 2006), and this association is strongest for conscien-
tiousness and neuroticism. For instance, there is evidence
that low conscientiousness (e.g., persons who tend to be dis-
organized, irresponsible, and undisciplined) is related to
negative health behaviors (e.g., smoking, drinking, poor
diet, and lack of exercise; Friedman et al., 1993; Hampson,
Goldberg, Vogt, & Dubanoski, 2007; Roberts, Kuncel,
Shiner, Caspi, & Goldberg, 2007) and negative health out-
comes (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, urinary problems,
stroke, a variety of mental illnesses, and earlier mortality;
Bogg & Roberts, 2004). Neuroticism, or negative emotion-
ality, also has clear associations with both health behaviors
and health outcomes. Neuroticism is related to the exposure
people have to stressors but also in their reaction (or over-
reaction) to stress (Bolger & Schilling, 1991; Kling, Ryff,
Love, & Essex, 2003; Mroczek & Almeida, 2004). One
such reaction is smoking, which accounts for about 25% of

Objectives. Personality traits predict numerous health outcomes, but previous studies have rarely used personality
change to predict health.
Methods. The current investigation utilized a large national sample of 3,990 participants from the Midlife in the U.S.
study (MIDUS) to examine if both personality trait level and personality change longitudinally predict 3 different health
outcomes (i.e., self-rated physical health, self-reported blood pressure, and number of days limited at work or home due
to physical health reasons) over a 10-year span.
Results. Each of the Big Five traits, except openness, predicted self-rated health. Change in agreeableness, conscien-
tiousness, and extraversion also predicted self-rated health. Trait levels of conscientiousness and neuroticism level pre-
dicted self-reported blood pressure. All trait levels except agreeableness predicted number of work days limited. Only
change in conscientiousness predicted the number of work days limited.
Discussion. Findings demonstrate that a full understanding of the link between personality and health requires
consideration of trait change as well as trait level.

the association between neuroticism and mortality, at least
among older adults (Mroczek, Spiro, & Turiano, 2009).
People high in neuroticism also have a higher risk of develop-
ing hypertension (Spiro, Aldwin, Ward, & Mroczek, 1995)
as well as obesity and metabolic syndrome (Hampson &
Friedman, 2008).
The personality­health link is less established for the
other Big Five traits, but the body of evidence is growing.
Earlier investigations of the Type A behavior pattern and
hostility facet of agreeableness clearly demonstrated an as-
sociation with risk of coronary heart disease (Myrtek, 2001;
Rosenman et al., 1964) as well as poor health behaviors
(Brummett et al., 2006). More recent investigations of gen-
eral trait agreeableness also suggest that lower levels are
associated with increased mortality risk (Weiss & Costa,
2005). A small number of studies found that low levels of
extraversion predicted earlier mortality (e.g., Wilson et al.,
2004). Additionally, people high in extraversion tend to ex-
perience greater amounts of positive affect and optimism,
both of which are also associated with health and longevity
(Danner, Snowdon, & Friesen, 2001). Openness has the
fewest documented links to health. Yet, recent studies have
found higher levels of openness to be protective against earlier
mortality (Hampson & Friedman, 2008).
The Effect of Trait Change on Physical Health
Most models of personality and health exclusively con-
ceptualize traits as static fixed predictors in the explanatory
chain that proceeds from traits to disease and ultimately
mortality. However, there are now studies documenting
that personality traits do change in adulthood (Jones &
Meredith, 1996; Mroczek & Spiro, 2003; Roberts, Walton, &
Viechtbauer, 2006; Small, Hertzog, Hultsch, & Dixon,
2003), although they tend to change slowly over a number
of years and they do not change for everyone; some indi-
viduals do remain stable. Furthermore, it is quite rare that
predictors of health, whether psychosocial or biomedical,
do not possess some dynamic element that changes over
time. Thus, our theoretical model goes further by hypothe-
sizing that personality trait change is likely to be, along with
initial trait level, important in predicting health outcomes.
The theoretical position that trait change, along with trait
level, is both important for health outcomes is supported by
a small number of recent studies. Mroczek and Spiro (2007)
documented both level and rate of change in neuroticism
predicted mortality over 18 years. Hampson and colleagues
(2010) demonstrated that change in agreeableness and so-
ciability predicts substance use. Siegler and colleagues
(2003) found that decreases in agreeableness predicted a
wide range of physical health risk factors, including obesity,
avoidance of exercise, a high-fat diet, and self-reports that
one's physical health had changed for the worse. Although
personality traits are often assumed static risk factors for ill-
ness or health, akin to the way that sex or race is conceived
as unchanging predictors, these more recent findings con-
firm that personality change has implications for the asso-
ciation between personality and health. That is, if someone
is at a given trait level (e.g., the 5th percentile on conscien-
tiousness), their risk of developing a health problem is ele-
vated. However, their risk may be reduced if the person
changes in the positive direction (e.g., rises to the 50th per-
centile on conscientiousness).
Present Study
In the current study, we examined the predictive effect of
both level and change among the Big Five personality traits
on three very different health outcomes assessed over a de-
cade after initial personality trait measurements: (a) self-
rated physical health, (b) self-reported blood pressure, and
(c) number of days limited at work or home due to physical
health reasons.
Hypotheses
With respect to trait level, we expected that higher levels
of agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and
openness would predict better health profiles, whereas
higher levels of neuroticism would be associated with worse
overall physical health. Moreover, we expected that people
decreasing on agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraver-
sion, and openness (from MIDUS 1 to MIDUS 2) would
predict worse health, whereas increases should be associ-
ated with better physical health. For neuroticism, we ex-
pected a decrease to be associated with better physical
health, whereas increases predicting worse health. Finally,
for all the above, we tested whether level and change can
combine in multiplicative ways to predict health outcomes.
Although exploratory, previous work by Mroczek and
Spiro (2007) demonstrates the utility in uncovering level by
change effects.
Method
Sample and Longitudinal Design
The first wave of the MIDUS study (MIDUS 1) collected
survey data from 7,108 noninstitutionalized English-speak-
ing adults in the coterminous United States, aged 25­74
years. Data were collected in 1995­1996. A longitudinal
follow-up of the original MIDUS study was conducted in
2004­2006 (MIDUS 2). Every attempt was made to contact
all the original respondents and invite them to participate in
a second wave of data collection. The average longitudinal
follow-up interval was approximately nine years (7.8­10.4
years). Of the 7,108 participants in MIDUS 1, 4,963 (75%
response rated, adjusted for mortality) were successfully
contacted to participate in another phone interview of ap-
proximately 30 min in length. Those who completed both
the self-administered questionnaires (SAQ) and the phone
interviews at MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 numbered 3,990.

Approximately 70% of participants were retained from
MIDUS 1 to MIDUS 2 (6% deceased, 12% refusal, 3% un-
able to interview, and 9% no working phone number). Anal-
ysis of attrition revealed that respondents lost to follow-up
differed from those who participated in the longitudinal panel
on certain variables. The longitudinal sample was signifi-
cantly higher on conscientiousness, t(6265) = 6.87, p < .001,
and significantly lower on neuroticism, t(6262) = 2.34,
p < .001, and agreeableness, t(6264) = 2.53, p < .001. The
longitudinal sample also had significantly higher self-rated
physical health, t(7095) = 10.97, p < .001, lower blood pres-
sure, t(7020) = 3.61, p < .001, and fewer work limitations,
t(7037) = 4.83, p < .001. A more complete discussion of
selective attrition among the MIDUS longitudinal sample is
available elsewhere (Radler & Ryff, 2010).
Measures
Control variables.--All models were adjusted for age, sex,
and education.Age ranged from 32 to 84 (M = 55) at MIDUS
2, and the sex distribution of participants was 47% male
(coded as 0) and 53% female (coded as 1). Participants re-
ported the highest level of education completed, which ranged
from 1 (some grade school/high school) to 4 (college gradu-
ate to professional degree). Approximately 39% had a high-
school degree or graduate equivalence degree, whereas 30%
had graduated college or obtained a professional degree.
Health outcomes.--The health outcomes considered
were assessed via the phone interview portion of the MIDUS
2. First, self-rated physical health was assessed by the fol-
lowing question: "In general, would you say your physical
health is excellent, very good, good, fair or poor?" Scores
ranged from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). This straightforward
evaluation of health is a valuable outcome because there is
strong empirical support that subjective evaluations of
health predict mortality above and beyond objective health
status measures and other known risk factors (DeSalvo,
Bioser, Reynolds, He, & Muntner, 2005; Idler & Benyamini,
1997; Miller & Wolinsky, 2007).
Self-reported blood pressure evaluated if personality
level and change predicted a more direct physiological mea-
sure of health. Participants responded if their blood pressure
at their last physician visit was low, about normal, slightly
raised, or high. Scores ranged from 1 (low) to 4 (high). Self-
reported blood pressure is a quick and an effective means of
assessing the physiologic aspect of general health. In fact,
estimates show that a sizable proportion of global prema-
ture deaths and disability each year is attributed to high
blood pressure (Lawes, Vander Hoorn, & Rodgers, 2008).
The third outcome, work limitations, was assessed by
asking how many of the past thirty days respondents were
limited in their work or normal household work activities
because of physical health. Respondents were required to
give the actual number of days out of 30, with 0 meaning
that no work limitations occurred. This outcome provides a
more functional day-to-day evaluation of how health limits
individuals from working or completing normative daily
tasks (Keyes & Grzywacz, 2005). In essence, it measures
the degree of impairment experienced on a daily level
specifically because of physical functioning.
Utilizing these distinct yet related outcomes allows for a
more comprehensive understanding of how personality and
personality change influences various proxies of health.
They provide a broad array of general, physiologic, and
functional indices of health. As displayed in Supplementary
Table 1, the correlations between the outcomes demonstrate
the interconnectedness of such physical health proxies. Spe-
cifically, the correlations between self-rated health and both
blood pressure and work days limited were negative, and
those reporting better overall physical health also report
lower blood pressure and fewer days limited in work.
Personality traits.--The key predictor variables (person-
ality trait level and trait change) were assessed via the self-
administered adjectival measures of the Big Five assessed
in both MIDUS 1 and 2 (Prenda & Lachman, 2001). Re-
spondents were asked how much each of 25 adjectives de-
scribed themselves on a scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to
4 (a lot). The adjectives were moody, worrying, nervous,
and calm (neuroticism); outgoing, friendly, lively, active,
and talkative (extraversion); creative, imaginative, intelli-
gent, curious, broad minded, sophisticated, and adventurous
(openness); organized, responsible, hardworking, and care-
less, (conscientiousness); and helpful, warm, caring, soft-
hearted, and sympathetic (agreeableness). The mean was
calculated from the adjectives for each trait after reverse
scoring the appropriate items.
The MIDUS Big Five scale was developed from a combi-
nation of existing personality trait lists and inventories
(Lachman & Weaver, 1997). From these lists, the most con-
sistently used adjectives were selected and used in a pilot
study of 1,000 men and women (ages 30­70 years) to iden-
tify the adjectives with the highest item to total correlations
and factor loadings. This scale has good construct validity
(Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998) and significantly correlates with
the NEO trait scales (Prenda & Lachman, 2001). Examina-
tion of the correlation matrix also provides evidence of con-
struct validity for this scale (Supplementary Table 1). There
was a significant and positive correlation between agree-
ableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness,
whereas there was a significant and negative correlation be-
tween neuroticism and the other four personality traits. Fur-
thermore, the longitudinal trait correlations from MIDUS 1
to MIDUS 2 were .64 for agreeableness, .62 for conscien-
tiousness, .69 for extraversion, .64 for neuroticism, and .70
for openness. Reliability alphas for the personality traits are
as follows: agreeableness = .80, conscientiousness = .58,
extraversion = .76, neuroticism = .74, and openness = .77.

Paired t tests using a Bonferroni adjustment documented
if each of the Big Five mean trait scores was significantly
different from MIDUS 1 to MIDUS 2 (Table 1). These anal-
yses indicated that each of the Big Five trait mean scores
decreased over the 9- to 10-year interval, and all the five
mean differences were statistically significant, thus indicating
mean-level personality change (Table 1).
Personality change scores.--Ideally, a study of change
contains at least three occasions of measurement along with
modeling that is specialized for estimating change (e.g.,
multilevel modeling). However, many long-term longitudi-
nal studies, such as the MIDUS, do not yet have three waves
of data. The use of change scores in such studies have re-
emerged in recent years as an acceptable and a transparent
way of assessing change if one is limited by two measure-
ment occasions (Mroczek & Spiro, 2007; Mroczek, Almeida,
Spiro, & Pafford, 2006; Rogosa, 1995; Spiro, 2007; Taris,
2000). In the current study, trait scores from the MIDUS 1
were subtracted from MIDUS 2 scores for each of the Big
Five. This yielded a difference score, or change score, for
each of the five traits for each person. Persons with positive
change scores were those for whom an MIDUS 2 trait score
was higher than their MIDUS 1 score. These were individu-
als who increased on a given trait. Conversely, persons with
negative change scores were those for whom a MIDUS 2
trait score was lower than their MIDUS 1 trait score.A change
score of zero implied stability over the 9- to 10-year inter-
val between the two measurement occasions. The range
and standard deviations for all trait change scores are
displayed in Table 1.
Note, the negative means for trait change reflect the find-
ings from the t tests analyses showing that scores on each of
the Big Five went down over the decade-long longitudinal
interval (Table 1). Note also that neuroticism has the largest
mean change score in terms of magnitude (-.17) and also
the highest standard deviation of the five, indicating greater
individual differences in amount of change compared with
the other four traits. Note that change scores were as large
as 2 in some individuals (Table 1).
One limitation of change scores is that they may repre-
sent regression to the mean and not represent real change.
Examination of the variance in change scores explained by
baseline (MIDUS 1) score suggested that the changes repre-
sented more than just regression to the mean: R-squared
values were .16 (agreeableness), .14 (conscientiousness),
.12 (extraversion), .22 (neuroticism), and .12 (openness).
Statistical Analysis
Each of the three health outcomes from MIDUS 2 were
regressed on the estimates of trait level and trait change for
each of the Big Five, controlling for age, sex, education, and
sample. Because all Big Five traits (trait level and change)
were included in one parsimonious model, the effects con-
trol for one another. The mean of MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2
personality scores represented trait level and the difference
scores represented trait change. The former indicated
whether absolute amount of a given trait predicted health.
We chose to use the mean of MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 per-
sonality scores instead of the MIDUS 1 score by itself to
represent trait level because adjustment for baseline scores
when analyzing change is known to lead to spurious results
in the presence of measurement error (Cain, Kronmal, &
Kosinski, 1992; Glymour, Weave, Berkman, Kawachi, &
Robins, 2005). The underlying problem is that when ad-
justed for a noisy baseline measurement, the change score
carries information about both level and change. Use of the
mean of MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 measurements as trait
level avoids this issue but in the process underestimates the
true effect of change (Cain et al., 1992). Lastly, a small
number of participants gave responses of don't know or did
not give answers to some questions. This reduced the num-
ber of respondents in the current study depending on the
outcome variable (see Table 2).
Results
Age and education were significant covariates for all three
health outcomes. Increasing age and lower levels of educa-
tion were associated with poorer evaluations of health, higher
blood pressure ratings, and more reported days limited in
work. Sex was a significant predictor for self-rated health and
blood pressure but not for days limited in work. Women
reported better physical health and lower blood pressure.
Table 2 displays the regression models for all three out-
comes investigated. For self-rated physical health, higher
levels of conscientiousness and extraversion predicted bet-
ter self-rated physical health at MIDUS 2. Higher levels of
neuroticism and agreeableness were associated with worse
self-rated physical health in the MIDUS 2. With respect to
TURIANO ET AL.

trait change, increases in conscientiousness and extraver-
sion predicted better self-rated physical health at MIDUS 2.
Conversely, increases in agreeableness predicted worse
self-rated physical health in MIDUS 2.
Personality levels of conscientiousness and neuroticism
were significant predictors of self-reported blood pressure.
Higher levels of conscientiousness predicted lower reported
blood pressure, whereas higher levels of neuroticism pre-
dicted higher blood pressure at MIDUS 2. None of the five
trait change variables predicted blood pressure at MIDUS 2.
Personality level was a significant predictor of the number
of days limited at work for all traits except agreeableness.
Higher levels of conscientiousness and extraversion pre-
dicted fewer limited days in MIDUS 2. Conversely, higher
levels of neuroticism and openness were associated with
more limited workdays. Only conscientiousness change pre-
dicted work limitations. Increases in conscientiousness pre-
dicted fewer work limitations in MIDUS 2. Lastly, none of
the interactions between trait level and change were signifi-
cant predictors of the three health outcomes.
Because the MIDUS study includes a subsample of twins
(30%) and siblings (15%), we conducted a post hoc sensi-
tivity analysis to ensure independence of observations. Spe-
cifically, one twin/sibling from each pair was randomly
dropped, and all analyses were conducted with this reduced
sample. The statistical significance of each main effect was
not affected, even in a substantially reduced sample size.
Discussion
This study builds on previous investigations document-
ing that the level of personality traits predicts health out-
comes (Bogg & Roberts, 2004; Hampson & Friedman,
2008; Roberts et al., 2007; Smith, 2006; Wilson, Bienas,
Mendes de Leon, Evans, & Bennett, 2003) and extends
those findings to a national sample of Americans. Across all
three health variables, higher levels of conscientiousness
predicted better health outcomes, whereas higher levels of
neuroticism reflected poorer outcomes. Higher levels of
extraversion predicted better self-rated health and fewer
health-related work reductions, whereas higher levels of
openness predicted fewer work reductions. Lastly, higher
levels of agreeableness predicted poorer health outcomes.
As noted in the "Introduction," considerable prior work has
documented the impact of neuroticism and conscientious-
ness on health, but few studies prior to this investigation
have shown evidence that higher levels of agreeableness,
extraversion, and openness are also significant predictors of
health.
Most importantly, this study provides evidence that long-
term change in the Big Five is related to various indices of
physical health, thereby extending similar findings from
smaller and less representative samples (Hampson et al.,
2010; Mroczek & Spiro, 2007; Siegler et al., 2003). The
findings were strongest for self-rated physical health, where
as predicted, increments on the more positive traits (consci-
entiousness and extraversion) predicted better health, whereas
decrements predicted poorer health. Counter to hypotheses
and previous literature, being more agreeable and increases
in this trait predicted poorer self-rated health. For blood
pressure, none of the change scores were significant predic-
tors. However, increases in conscientiousness significantly
predicted fewer health-related work reductions.

PERSONALITY CHANGE AND HEALTH 9
Overall, such results underscore the importance of cross-
time dynamics in personality traits as independent influ-
ences on health. The fact that both trait level and change
predicted self-rated health, an outcome that clearly predicts
mortality (Idler & Benyamini, 1997), constitutes an impor-
tant extension of prior literature that personality traits are
not static risk factors but dynamic predictors of health
(Mroczek & Spiro, 2007). In fact, the percentages of
explained variance specifically by personality (trait and
change net of controls) were highest for self-rated health
(R2 = .09) but much smaller for blood pressure (R2 = .01),
and work reductions (R2 = .01). Future work is clearly
needed to document the scope of effects of personality and
change on multiple indices of physical health.
Future Directions
Mechanisms linking personality and health.--As evi-
dence accumulates linking personality (level and change)
and health outcomes, research will necessarily need to shift
in the direction of accounting for these effects, that is, expli-
cating the pathways through which core individual differ-
ence variables are consequential for multiple aspects of
health, including disability, morbidity, and mortality. From
an epidemiological framework, personality traits are distal
predictors of health, meaning personality operates through
a series of interconnected mechanisms. Thus, future inqui-
ries would benefit from simultaneously attending to behav-
ioral and psychosocial mechanisms (e.g., Friedman, 2000;
Hampson & Friedman, 2008; Roberts et al., 2007) as well
as related physiological processes (neuroendocrine, cardio-
vascular, and inflammatory; e.g., B. Singer & Ryff, 2001;
Uchino, 2006).
Putting all the above together to understand how person-
ality traits set in motion a panoply of influences (behavioral,
psychosocial, and situational), many of which invoke multi-
faceted biological substrates, is a tall agenda. In managing
the attendant complexities, there is merit in invoking the
idea of a pathway through which these multiple influences
converge, albeit via different combinations of factors for
different subgroups of individuals. Previous work illustrates
how to implement this kind of integrative approach with
novel (at least for psychologists) analytic tools, such as re-
cursive partitioning (Gruenewald, Mroczek, Ryff, & Singer,
2008), which allow for multiway interactions as well as
nonlinear relations among variables on the way to particular
health outcomes.
Finally, to the extent that such integrative analyses inter-
est investigators toiling in the above fields, such inquiries
should not be disproportionately focused on negative path-
ways (i.e., how high neuroticism or low conscientiousness
activate an array of dysfunctional processes that culminate
in early morbidity or mortality). Extensive attention is also
needed to understand the positive/preventive pathways (i.e.,
how high extraversion, agreeableness, and openness con-
tribute to a multitude of salutogenic processes that help
keep people healthy as they move across the decades of
adulthood and later life), which illuminate how positive
health is achieved and sustained (Ryff & Singer, 1998).
Prevention and intervention.--In light of the inherent
complexities connecting personality to health, the fact
remains that personality is a set of malleable traits. A more
recent framework for personality development is the idea of
interindividual differences in personality change through-
out adulthood (Mroczek & Spiro, 2007; Roberts & Mroczek,
2008; Roberts et al., 2006; Small et al., 2003). Some indi-
viduals remain stable on personality traits, whereas some
increase and others decrease. Moreover, Mroczek and Spiro
(2007) show that this change has important consequences
on healthnamely mortality.
The main issue that remains is how to facilitate personal-
ity change that benefits health over the life course. First,
epidemiologic research would stress targeting upstream
factors or preventative measures earlier in life to impede
trajectories of damaging health behavior and physiological
functioning (Moffitt et al., 2011). Second, it is not entirely
clear to what extent personality would need to change to
affect deleterious downstream processes. Current research
shows that personality change occurs over long time spans
(i.e., decades; Roberts et al., 2006), and the effect sizes are
modest, so any brief personality intervention will likely
falter. However, when examining personality during longer
durations such as from young adulthood to old age, traits
such as conscientiousness have shown increases up to a full
standard deviation (Roberts et al. 2006). Third, it is un-
likely that one size would fit all because some individuals
as well as certain traits are more amenable to personality
change than others (Caspi, Roberts, & Shiner, 2005) in cer-
tain environments (Caspi & Moffitt, 1993), and there is
evidence for individual differences in who remains stable,
who changes, and the rate of change (Mroczek & Spiro,
2003).
Potential interventions aimed at single or multiple as-
pects of personality could include changing the underly-
ing cognitive or psychological processes associated with
particular traits (i.e., creativity, responsibility), the physi-
ological responses to stress (i.e., dampening stress reac-
tivity of the hypothalamic­pituitary­adrenal axis), or the
health behaviors associated with particular traits (i.e.,
substance use behaviors). For example, targeting specific
aspects of personality for individuals scoring higher in
neuroticism that are predisposed to experience negative
affect and adverse physiologic arousal would involve im-
plementing more effective ways to deal with stress (e.g.,
relaxation techniques, refraining from smoking) or in-
creasing self-control (Moffitt et al., 2011). These techniques
are not necessarily changing a person's level of neuroti-
cism but the negative health behaviors and physiological

reactions underlying this trait. At this point, it may be pre-
sumptuous to suggest specific personality-related interven-
tions, but some have laid out a framework for doing so
(Moffitt et al., 2011), and preliminary intervention research
provides promise (Baumeister, Gailliot, DeWall, & Oaten,
2006; Conrod, Stewart, Comeau, & Maclean, 2006; Jack-
son, Hill, Payne, Roberts, & Stine-Morrow, Under review).
Limitations
The main limitation of the current study is the availability
of only two measurement occasions of personality. With
only two measurement occasions, advanced statistical tech-
niques such as "MLM" are not appropriate (J. D. Singer &
Willett, 2003). Utilizing change scores is often criticized
with respect to regression to the mean. However, after using
the mean of MIDUS 1 and MIDUS 2 personality scores to
represent level, we are confident that the analysis estimated
true trait change and not simply a statistical artifact caused
by regression to the mean. In fact, this technique actually
leads to an underestimate of the change score effect (Cain
et al., 1992; Glymour et al., 2005). As Spiro (2007) has ar-
gued, the concerns regarding change scores are more per-
ceived than real. A second limitation of having only two
measurements of personality is the inability to estimate rate
of change or any parameter that informs us about the pro-
cess of change (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; Rogosa, 1995;
J. D. Singer & Willett, 2003). Using statistical techniques
such as "MLM" when at least three time points are available
will permit the best estimation growth curves that are charac-
terized by relatively accurate intercepts and slopes in any psy-
chosocial variable (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; J. D. Singer &
Willett, 2003).
Addressing a final issue of change, trait change itself is
predicted by such variables as role change (Roberts, 1997;
Roberts & Chapman, 2001), major life events (divorce and
death of spouse; Mroczek & Spiro, 2003), and health itself
(Mroczek & Spiro, 2007). Moreover, the two points of mea-
surement in the MIDUS does not establish cause­effect re-
lationships among personality, change, and health, which
must be considered when interpreting the findings of the
current study. It would be interesting to examine the com-
plex pathways and feedback loops between role change,
health, or life events with personality and trait change.
A second caveat of the current study is the interconnect-
edness of personality and self-reported health outcomes.
For example, individuals scoring higher in neuroticism tend
to report more negative health symptoms and perceive
themselves in poorer health (Chapman, Duberstein,
Sorensen, & Lyness, 2006; Costa & McCrae, 1987; Watson
& Pennebaker, 1989). Thus, self-reported health outcomes
by neurotics may not reflect poorer health but their perception
of their health. There are apparent difficulties in disentangling
perceived versus actual health, but as stated earlier, it is this
perception of one's own health that is a better predictor of
mortality than more objective measures. Likewise, it is not a
coincidence that the higher levels of the other Big Five traits
are associated with better self-reported health (Goodwin, &
Engstrom, 2002). Individuals high in these traits are likely
to report better health simply because they are the ones in
better health, which can be supported empirically (Hamp-
son & Friedman, 2008). Moreover, the selective attrition
from MIDUS 1 to MIDUS 2 leaves unanswered questions
about the role of personality change among those already in
poor health. Drop out among those lower in conscientious-
ness and higher in neuroticism could bias the findings but
are also likely to underestimate the effect of personality and
change on the health outcomes investigated. The significant
main effects for both personality level and change in the
current study exist despite range restrictions due to selective
drop out based on personality as well as those already rating
their health as poor.
Lastly, future investigations would benefit from more de-
scriptive (i.e., both systolic and diastolic) and objective
measures of blood pressure from trained personnel. Al-
though physicians actually measured blood pressure at a
previous medical visit, participants were still required to
retrospectively report whether their doctor told them that
they had low, normal, or high blood pressure. Obviously,
this may influence the validity of this outcome. It would be
more useful to have exact readings of systolic and diastolic
blood pressure that provide an opportunity to examine pulse
pressure (systolic minus diastolic), which may be the best
predictor of subsequent cardiovascular function (Haider,
Larson, Franklin, & Levy, 2003).
Conclusions
Despite the noted limitations, the current study adds to
the burgeoning literature that personality traits predict im-
portant health outcomes. Moreover, this study is among the
first documenting that both personality trait level and trait
change predict various health outcomes. The findings are
also strengthened by longitudinal period (approximately 10
years) and the national representativeness of this sample.
Uncovering personality level and change combinations that
lead to poor or positive health outcomes over time should
become a priority for personality­health research. Indeed,
trait change may occur slowly and for many people may not
occur at all. Yet for others, trait change becomes a salient
factor influencing physical health outcomes across the life
course.
