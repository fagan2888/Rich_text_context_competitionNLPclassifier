Introduction
A recent national survey estimated that 139.7
million indi-
viduals over 12years of age currently drink alcohol, account-
ing for a substantial portion (43.6%) of the total US
population.1 Although most individuals consume alcohol in
moderate amounts with no adverse effects, others use alcohol
to a problematic degree. Excessive alcohol use has been cor-
related with 200 other health problems, and deaths involving
alcohol use are the fourth leading preventable cause of death
in the United States.2,3 In addition, early initiation into alco-
hol use is related to increased likelihood of heavy drinking
and alcohol-related problems.4 As such, identifying behavio-
ral antecedents in adolescence, a developmental period in
which alcohol initiation frequently occurs, has particular
importance for preventing the development of problematic
alcohol use. Research that establishes identifiable behavioral
antecedents to alcohol use in adolescence, and in turn distin-
guishes those most at risk of developing subsequent alcohol-
related problems, may lead to preemptive interventions that
prevent escalation into problematic drinking.
Pathways to alcohol use
Robust evidence for 2 distinct but related behavioral path-
ways to alcohol use has emerged within the literature. The
first, an externalizing pathway, is characterized by impulsive,
antisocial, and/or delinquent behavior and is posited to result
from behavioral undercontrol or dysregulation.4,5 Such con-
duct is presumed to be some of the first behaviorally mala-
daptive correlates of later substance use. Indeed, previous
research demonstrates that childhood and early adolescent
externalizing problems are predictive of an earlier initiation
into substance use,6 late adolescent alcohol use,7 and alcohol
dependence in young adulthood.8 Specifically, delinquent
behavior is frequently antecedent to substance use, suggesting
that adolescents may typically begin to use alcohol only after
previous engagement in delinquent activity; longitudinal
studies have further substantiated this temporal ordering.9,10
Thus, previous research suggests not only that delinquency
and alcohol use are correlated but also that delinquency is
often temporally precedent to alcohol use.
An alternate, internalizing pathway to alcohol use, wherein
individuals use alcohol as a purported means of coping with
symptoms of negative emotionality and behavioral inhibition,
has also been reflected in the literature.11 Prospective analyses
point to positive associations between major depressive disor-
der at age 11 and the initiation and regular use of alcohol by
age 14.5 In addition, a cross-lagged panel analysis designed to
explore direction of causation suggested that depression at age
12 was positively associated with alcohol use at age 15, but that
the reverse did not hold true.12 Moreover, the influence of ado-
lescent internalizing problems on alcohol use appears to persist
into adulthood, but with different effects. Evidence from 2

ABSTRACT: Prior research has demonstrated that adolescent delinquency and depression are prospectively related to adult alcohol use and
that adolescent religiosity may influence these relationships. However, such associations have not been investigated using person-centered
approaches that provide nuanced explorations of these constructs. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health, we examined whether adolescent delinquency and depression differentiated typologies of adult alcohol users and whether these
relationships varied across religiosity profiles. Three typologies of self-identified Christian adolescents and 4 types of adult alcohol users were
identified via latent profile analysis. Delinquency and depression were related to increased likelihood of membership in heavy drinking or
problematic alcohol use profiles, but this relationship was most evident among those likely to be involved in religious practices. These results
demonstrate the importance of person-centered approaches in characterizing the influences of internalizing and externalizing behaviors on
subsequent patterns of alcohol use.

separate large-scale, longitudinal studies report that early ado-
lescent internalizing problems13 and late adolescent depressed
affect14 were negatively related to alcohol use throughout early
and mid-adulthood. It would seem that while early internaliz-
ing symptoms are generally associated with increased risk of
alcohol use within adolescence, they are conversely somewhat
protective of the same alcohol-related behaviors in adulthood.
These findings highlight the complex role of internalizing
symptoms in the development of alcohol use.
Although both pathways have been linked to alcohol use
separately, it is unlikely that either pathway operates in isola-
tion. Rather, internalizing and externalizing problems are
dynamic and tend to co-occur,15­19 evidenced by frequent
comorbidity of conduct disorder and depression in adoles-
cents.20,21 In addition, the emergence of both internalizing and
externalizing problems predates adolescent alcohol use.22,23 In
instances when internalizing and externalizing problems co-
occur, the specific interplay between these behaviors may dif-
ferentially affect the likelihood of alcohol use.For example,one
study found that while the presence of both internalizing and
externalizing problems was predictive of later adolescent alco-
hol use, this relationship was not as strong as the relationship
between displaying only externalizing problems and later alco-
hol use.24 It appears that in this case, internalizing problems
may interact with externalizing problems in such a way that
this conditional association selectively functions as a protective
factor against alcohol use. Such findings demonstrate that
these constructs operate in synchrony and that an individual's
pathway to alcohol use may vary as a function of both internal-
izing and externalizing problems.17,24
Heterogeneity of alcohol use
Just as the various pathways leading to alcohol use are not
homogeneous, patterns of alcohol use behaviors (eg, frequen-
cies and quantities of consumption, and frequencies of binge
drinking or intoxication) are more complex than a dichotomy
of problematic or nonproblematic use. To capture these
nuances, researchers have used person-centered approaches to
identify typologies of alcohol users. Person-centered
approaches, including cluster analysis and latent class analysis,
among others, identify homogeneous subgroups of individuals
who share similar characteristics within a heterogeneous popu-
lation; in turn, we can assess whether and how different sub-
groups are qualitatively different from other subgroups.25,26
Person-centered approaches have been used to identify sub-
groups of individuals with similar patterns of alcohol use
behaviors.27­30 In their recent study, Donovan and Chung28
used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify 4 prototypical
response patterns across a set of alcohol use indicators, which
they conventionally referred to as the abstainers, low-intake
drinkers, nonproblem drinkers, and problem drinkers. Given such
heterogeneity in patterns of alcohol use, as well as the complex
interplay among behavioral antecedents associated with
increased alcohol use, it is of interest to identify additional
behavioral antecedents that may be related to greater odds of
nonproblem drinking or abstinence, remembering that such
antecedents may be equally nuanced.
Religiosity as a protective factor
Previous research has identified contextual factors correlated
with lower levels of alcohol use, as well as decreased prevalence
of delinquency and depression.Religiosity is one such factor that
is generally considered to serve a protective function with respect
to alcohol use and its developmental correlates31­35 and for which
small but significant negative associations with delinquency,36­40
depressive symptoms,41­44 and alcohol use45­47 have been identi-
fied via cross-sectional and prospective analyses. Most studies
have used single item or composite measures as indicators of
one's religiousness, typically reflecting one's frequency of reli-
gious service attendance,or how important religion is to an indi-
vidual. Even though these studies have attempted to examine
associations with various aspects of religiosity, the analyses have
primarily been variable centered. However, several recent studies
have sought to examine typologies of individuals with qualita-
tively distinct patterns of responding to religiosity-focused indi-
cators.48­51 Results of these studies suggest the presence of
between 3 and 5 prototypical latent religiosity groups during
adolescence; the discrepancies in the number of religiosity pro-
files identified across these analyses may be the result of consid-
erable heterogeneity in the religiosity indicators used in each
analysis. Further investigation into latent typologies of religious
individuals based on commonly used indicators of religiosity is
needed to elucidate the number and specific characteristics of
adolescent religiosity typologies.
In addition, some research has invoked variable-centered
approaches to explore the ways in which members of religiosity
profiles differ in terms of delinquency, depression, and alcohol
use. For example, Salas-Wright et al51 found that adolescents
who were members of latent profiles with high levels of both
public and private religiosity had the lowest levels of alcohol use
and delinquency. In addition, Park et al49 identified 4 groups of
religious/spiritual individuals; interestingly, those most likely to
be members of the highly religious and minimally religious pro-
files had the lowest levels of depressive symptoms.However,the
associations with religiosity examined in each of these studies
were exclusively cross-sectional, thereby precluding any exami-
nation of developmentally informative associations between
typologies of religiosity and behavioral correlates.We expanded
on this limitation in this study by examining cross-temporal
associations among patterns of religiosity, behavioral anteced-
ents, and subsequent patterns of alcohol use.
The present study
In this study, we provided a number of contributions to the
literature on these processes. First, we examined typologies of
Hoyland et al 3
both religiosity and alcohol use to uncover nuances across
homogeneous subgroups of self-identified Christian adoles-
cents and adult alcohol users. Next, we explored relationships
between adolescent delinquency/depressive symptoms and
adulthood alcohol use typology in response to a void of longi-
tudinal examinations of behavioral antecedents to patterns of
alcohol use. Finally, these relationships were further examined
within the context of latent profiles of religiosity to determine
the extent to which the associations between delinquency,
depression, and alcohol use varied across discrete patterns of
religiosity. Given that there is variation in the characteristics of
typologies of both religiosity and alcohol use in the litera-
ture,27­29,49­51 and that it would be difficult to make predictions
about the relationships among all nuances within typologies of
these constructs, all analyses were considered exploratory.
Methods
Sample
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health (Add Health) is a nationally representative survey of
American adolescents,providing data on a wide range of health
behaviors, attitudes, and environmental factors, including
demographics, family relationships, sexual behavior, deviance,
and substance use.52 The first wave of data collection consisted
of in-school surveys of more than 90000 US students in 7th to
12th grades during the 1994-1995 school year. Approximately
12000 of these students were randomly selected to participate
in detailed in-home interviews. These adolescents were fol-
lowed up at wave 2 (1996, approximately ages 12-20), wave 3
(2001-2002, approximately ages 18-26), and wave 4 (2008-
2009, approximately ages 24-32). For detailed sampling infor-
mation, see Harris et al.52
The data from a portion of the in-home sample were de-
identified and made available for public use. We reduced this
sample to consist only of white,African American,or Hispanic
individuals who self-reported Catholic or Protestant religious
affiliation and had no missing responses to any of the 5 religi-
osity items at waves 1 and 2. We also restricted the sample to
individuals who had complete responses to alcohol use items at
wave 4. These restrictions were put into place to use the
maximal amount of complete data, as religiosity items were not
assessed among those who did not report a religious affiliation.
The final sample consisted of 2610 individuals (55.5% female).
These adolescents had a mean age of 15.57years at wave 1 and
consisted of 63.2% white, 24.4% African American, and 12.5%
Hispanic individuals.Nearly three-fourths (73.1%) of the sam-
ple identified as Protestant at wave 1.The sample had a moder-
ate average adulthood alcohol intake (measured at wave 4),
drinking approximately 60days per year (just more than once
per week), consuming an average of 2.75 drinks per occasion.
Measures
Demographics.
All demographic data reflect adolescent
responses at wave 1. Sex was dummy coded (female
=
1). Age
was calculated by subtracting participants' date of birth from
the date of their in-home interview. Effect coding was used to
derive 2 indicators of race, with whites serving as the reference
group in comparison with both African Americans and
Hispanics.
Delinquency. Nonviolent delinquent behavior was assessed via
5 items in the wave 1 in-home interview, reflecting the fre-
quency of engagement in these behaviors within the previous
12
months (see Table 1 for item wording). These items were
selected from a study by Kuhl et al.53 Individuals responded on
a scale where 0
=
"never," 1
=
"1 or 2 times," 2
=
"3 or 4 times,"
and 3="5 or more times" (=.63).
Depression. Depressive symptoms were assessed via the Center
for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).54 Nine
items from this scale were selected for analysis,as Jacobson and
Newman55 demonstrated that a reduced number of items in
the CES-D reflect a unidimensional depression construct.Par-
ticipants were asked how often a number of statements were
true of them during the past week (on a scale from 0="never or
rarely" to 3="most or all of the time," =.78) (see Table 1 for
specific item wordings). Items were recoded, so higher values
represented more frequent presence of depressive symptoms.
Religiosity. Religiosity was assessed from items in the wave 2
questionnaire. Items consisted of frequency of religious service
attendance and frequency of attendance at other religiously
Table 1. Specific items used for delinquency and depression at wave 1.

All delinquency items were on a scale of 0="never," 1="1 or 2 times," 2="3 or 4 times," and 3="5 or more times." All depression items were on a scale of 0="never or
rarely" to 3="most or all of the time."

affiliated activities, such as youth group or choir (both on a
scale from 1="once a week or more" to 4="never"), frequency
of personal prayer (1="at least once a day"to 5="never"), belief
in the inerrancy of scripture (1
=
"agree" or 2
=
"disagree"), and
importance of religion in one's life (1
=
"very important" to
4
=
"not important at all"). All items were recoded, so higher
response values indicated more frequent practice or stronger
belief.Coefficient alpha for these items indicated good internal
consistency (
=
.70). In addition, a single item asked about
respondent's religious affiliation and was dichotomously coded
into Catholic=0 and Protestant=1.
Alcohol use. Items to assess adulthood alcohol use were taken
from the wave 4 questionnaire and were identical to those
used in a study by Donovan and Chung.28 The first item
asked whether the participant had ever had a drink of alcohol
more than 2 or 3 times, to which respondents could answer
"yes" or "no." Three separate items measured the number of
days in the past year on which the respondent (1) drank alco-
hol, (2) drank 5 or more drinks in a row, and (3) was drunk
or very high on alcohol. Response categories consisted of
0="none," 1="1 or 2days," 2="once a month or less," 3="2
or 3days a month," 4="1 or 2days a week," 5="3 to 5days a
week," and 6
=
"every day or almost every day." One item
asked about the quantity of alcohol consumed per drinking
occasion, to which participants responded with a number
from 1 to 18.
Alcohol-related consequences were also assessed at wave 4.
Four items asked about the frequency of experiencing conse-
quences, and each item was responded to on a 3-point scale,
where 0="never,"1="1 time,"and 2="more than 1 time."These
4 items covered the frequency with which consuming alcohol
(1) disrupted responsibilities in school or the workplace, (2) led
to situations that may have put oneself or others at risk, (3) led
to legal problems or arrest, and (4) led to relationship problems
with family, friends, or colleagues. Coefficient alpha across all
items was .62.
A composite measure of adolescent alcohol use was created
by multiplying the quantity of alcohol consumed by frequency
of alcohol use at wave 1. This was used as a control variable in
all analyses predicting wave 4 alcohol use, as quantity by fre-
quency indices of alcohol use is one of the easiest ways to assess
total volume of alcohol consumption and is commonly used in
alcohol research.56
Analytic plan
A number of steps were taken to reduce the data before the
final models were constructed. All analyses were conducted in
Mplus version 7.2.57 First, factor scores of delinquency and
depression were extracted via confirmatory factor analysis
(CFA). We also performed exploratory factor analyses (EFAs)
to substantiate the unidimensionality of both constructs; this
was done to ensure that the items used to extract factor scores
via CFA were definitively representative of a single latent con-
struct within the sample of interest.
Next, LPAs were conducted with respect to wave 2 religios-
ity and wave 4 alcohol use indicators. LPA is a person-centered
analytic technique that examines response patterns across a set
of items, classifying cases based on the likelihood of sharing
discrete homogeneous patterns of responses.58 In doing so,
LPA tests a series of models comparing k profiles with k-1
profiles (eg, a 2-profile model compared with a 1-profile
model), proceeding until the extraction of an additional profile
(ie, 3 versus 2 profiles and 4 versus 3 profiles) results in a sig-
nificant decrement in model fit. Importantly, each model yields
posterior probabilities of membership for every individual with
respect to each of the k prototypical item response patterns (ie,
profiles), such that the sum of those probabilities equals 1.
In the absence of a criterion standard for determining the
best number of profiles in LPA, model selection was based on
several criteria. Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is an
indicator of model fit where decreased values across succes-
sive models suggest improved fit.59 Because BIC may con-
tinue to decrease across successive models in large samples,
additional fit measures were also considered. Entropy meas-
ures the amount of organization or accuracy in determining
profile membership on a scale from 0 to 1, with increasing
values indicating better classification of profile member-
ship.60 The theoretical fit of the model, number of individu-
als in resulting profiles, and significance levels (P-values)
from the Vuong-Lo-Mendell-Rubin Likelihood Ratio test
were also considered.61,62 For a complete list of considera-
tions in identifying appropriate profile structure in LPA, see
Nylund et al.59
After the best fitting models were selected, we assessed
main effects via multinomial logistic regression, wherein the
latent categorical variable representing alcohol use response
patterns was regressed on delinquency, depression, and a delin-
quency by depression interaction term. Demographic covari-
ates of age, race, and sex, in addition to covariates of wave 1
alcohol use and Catholic/Protestant identification, were
included in these and all subsequent models. We ran compara-
ble models with multiple reference profiles to obtain odds
ratios (OR) of all pairwise comparisons among the alcohol use
profiles.Although logistic regression is most commonly carried
out using a single reference profile, having multiple reference
profiles allowed us to understand the likelihood of demonstrat-
ing any one pattern of alcohol use in comparison with any
other pattern of alcohol use; using a single reference profile
would limit our ability to examine the relative risk of develop-
ing a particular pattern of alcohol use in relation to other pat-
terns. Next, we examined these same effects among those who
were most likely to be members of each religiosity profile.
These conditional effects were accounted for by separate model
specifications for each religiosity latent profile; that is,the mul-
tinomial logistic regression of the latent categorical variable
representing alcohol use on depression and delinquency was
conditioned on the profile-specific parameters of each religios-
ity latent profile.57,63

Results
Data reduction
Delinquency and depression factors.Exploratory factor analyses
confirmed unidimensional delinquency and depression con-
structs.Factor loadings for the 5 delinquency items ranged from
0.65 to 0.87, and factor loadings for the 9 depression items
ranged from 0.39 to 0.89.Eigenvalues for the delinquency items
supported a 1-factor model with an eigenvalue of 3.38 account-
ing for 67.6% of the variance,and the depression items similarly
loaded onto a single factor; the eigenvalue for the 1-factor
model was 4.28 and accounted for 47.5% of the variance.
Alcohol use model selection and identification. Prior to inclusion
in LPA, the wave 4 alcohol use items were recoded in accor-
dance with thresholds previously determined to be empirically
significant in the Add Health sample at wave 1.28 Whether an
individual had ever had a drink was dichotomously recoded
(0
=
"No" and 1
=
"Yes"). The items capturing drinking fre-
quency, frequency of getting drunk, and frequency of binge
drinking were recoded into 3 response categories (0
=
"None,"
1="Once/year to 2-3days/month," and 2="Once/week plus").
The item measuring the average consumption during a single
drinking episode was recoded into 4 response categories
(0="None," 1="1 drink," 2="2-6 drinks," and 3="7+drinks").
Finally, the sum of negative consequences was dichotomously
recoded (0="0-2 consequences" and 1="3+consequences").
Model selection criteria for 2-profile LPA model through
5-profile LPA model can be found in Table 2. All fit indices
(except for entropy, which did not substantially change) con-
sistently improved across the 2-profile LPA model through
5-profile model. However, the 4-profile model was selected
over the 5-profile model, as the 5-profile model produced one
profile containing 34 individuals (0.01% of the sample), which
was insufficient to draw any meaningful comparisons. (We did
not include respondents who reported having no religion in
any of the analyses. However, a separate LPA of wave 4 alcohol
use items did demonstrate that a 4-profile model also fits best
among these individuals, suggesting that these results are
robust to the exclusion of nonreligious respondents.The result
of this analysis is available from the authors upon request.)
Average alcohol use characteristics of the resulting 4 response
patterns are graphically depicted in Figure 1, and Table 3 pro-
vides the same characteristics in their original units. We
adopted the profile names provided by Donovan and Chung28
to facilitate comparison between our analyses.
The profile that best characterized the largest portion of the
sample (N=894,34.3%) yielded mean item responses that were
consistently 0.5 SD above the sample means. This response
pattern was referred to as the nonproblem drinkers. Individuals
most likely to demonstrate this pattern on average consumed
nearly 4 drinks per drinking occasion and drank just more than
85days per year (approximately 25% of days per year). In addi-
tion, they reported being intoxicated 10
days per year and
engaging in binge drinking nearly 14days per year on average,
but reported experiencing 1 to 2 alcohol-related consequences
in their lifetime.
A second response pattern was representative of 26.9% of
the sample (N=705) and was named the abstainers.This profile
was characterized by those who rarely or never drank alcohol,
as demonstrated by average reports of both quantity and fre-
quency of alcohol use nearly 2 full SDs below those most likely
to be members of the nonproblem drinkers. On average, indi-
viduals most likely to be members of the abstainers reported no
instances of binge drinking or intoxication, nearly 1 SD below
the sample mean.
The next response pattern was representative of a similar
proportion of the sample (N
=
696, 26.6%). This profile was
referred to as the low-intake drinkers and was characterized by
individuals who, on average, reported comparatively modest
quantities (2.5 drinks) and frequencies (26
days per year) of
alcohol consumption, both of which were 1.5 SDs above those
most likely to be members of the abstainers. In contrast, these
individuals were similar to members of the abstainers profile
with respect to average levels of binge drinking, intoxication,
and alcohol-related consequences.
The final profile was representative of the smallest propor-
tion of the sample (N=317, 12.1%) and was characterized by
holding the highest mean frequencies across all alcohol use
items. Compared with those most likely to be members of the
nonproblem drinkers, individuals most likely to display this
response pattern (named problem drinkers) were on average 1.5
SDs higher on binge drinking frequency (154days per year), a
full standard deviation higher on frequency of intoxication
(104
days per year), and nearly 0.5 SD higher on number of
alcohol-related consequences (2.72).

Religiosity latent profile model selection and identification.We
explored models for 2 through 4 profiles of religiosity items.As
seen in Table 4, BIC values continually decreased across the
2-profile model to 4-profile model, but the 4-profile model
exhibited a significant decrement in model fit (P=.66). Thus,
the 3-profile model was selected. To facilitate comparison
among the profiles, mean item responses among individuals
most likely to be members of each religiosity profile based on
their highest posterior probability of membership are graphi-
cally depicted in Figure 2. In addition, the proportions of item
response endorsements among those most likely to be mem-
bers of each profile are available in Table 5.
The most representative profile accounted for 49.0% of the
sample (N=1279) and was characterized by the highest mean
levels of religiosity. This profile was conventionally referred to
as the loyal. On average, members of this profile prayed and
attended religious services and activities more frequently than
members of any other profile, demonstrating item frequencies
consistently 0.5 SD above the sample mean.
The next most representative profile accounted for 37.9% of
the sample (N
=
989) and demonstrated at or slightly below
mean levels of religiosity. Specifically, individuals most likely to
display this response pattern (referred to as the reserved) were a
full standard deviation below likely members of the loyal group
with respect to both the importance of religiosity and attend-
ance at religious activities. However, those most likely to be
members of the reserved were on average less than 0.5 SD
below those most likely to be members of the loyal regarding
belief in the inerrancy of scripture.

of the sample (N=342,13.1%) and was referred to as the apathetic.
The defining characteristics of this response pattern were mean
frequencies of attendance at religious services and prayers that
were 2 full SDs below the means for those most likely to be mem-
bers of the loyal. Interestingly, those most likely to be members of
the apathetic profile were similar to members of the reserved
regarding importance of religion, but were on average at least 0.5
SD lower than members of the reserved on all other items.
Prediction of alcohol use profiles
First,the predictive effects of delinquency and depression on alco-
hol use profiles were examined.Table 6 provides the ORs related
to likelihood of membership in the alcohol use profiles as pre-
dicted by delinquency and depression separately, as well as the
interaction between them. Delinquency differentiated between
likelihood of membership in nearly all comparisons between adult
alcohol use profiles. Specifically, each increase of 1 SD in delin-
quency was associated with more than a 2-fold increase in the
likelihood of membership in the problem drinkers group relative to
both the abstainers (OR=2.14,P<.01) and the low-intake drinkers
(OR=2.35, P
<
.01). Odds of membership in the nonproblem
drinkers group evidenced similar, though somewhat more modest
increases per unit change in delinquency relative to the abstainers
(OR=1.76, P<.01) and the low-intake drinkers (OR=1.94,
P
<
.01). Adolescent delinquency did not, however, significantly
differentiate membership in the problem drinkers versus nonprob-
lem drinkers,or in the abstainers versus low-intake drinkers.
The effects of depression on alcohol use were more obscure.
Depression did not appear to differentiate between those most
likely to be low-intake drinkers and members of the other 3 pro-
files, as well as between those most likely to be members of the
problemdrinkers and the abstainers.Interestingly,however,for every

slightly less likely to be members of the nonproblem drinkers in
comparison with the abstainers (OR=0.78, P=.02), but equally
more likely to be members of the problem drinkers when compared
with the nonproblem drinkers (OR=1.35,P=.02).The delinquency
by depression interaction did not significantly differentiate among
likelihood of membership in adult alcohol use profiles.
Religiosity profile­specific prediction of alcohol use
profiles
Next, we assessed the extent to which the relationship between
delinquency and depression and likelihood of membership in
alcohol use profiles differed among those most likely to be
members of discrete religiosity profiles (ie, these relationships
were conditioned on posterior probabilities of religiosity profile
membership).Table 6 also provides ORs and significance levels
for associations between delinquency and/or depression and
alcohol use profiles when conditioned on membership in each
religiosity profile.When conditioned on likelihood of member-
ship in the loyal religiosity profile, each unit increase in delin-
quency was associated with an increased likelihood of
membership in the problem drinkers and nonproblem drinkers
relative to both abstainers and low-intake drinkers. For example,
given membership in the loyal religiosity profile, individuals
were nearly 3 times as likely to be members of the nonproblem

drinkers as they were to be low-intake drinkers (OR=2.88,
P=.04).Among those most likely to be members of the reserved
religiosity profile,a 1 SD increase in delinquency was associated
with an increased likelihood of membership in the nonproblem
compared with low-intake drinkers (OR=1.69, P=.04). Finally,
when conditioned on membership in the apathetic religiosity
profile, a commensurate increase in delinquency was associated
with an increased likelihood of membership in the problem
drinkers (OR=2.05,P=.01) and nonproblem drinkers (OR=1.76,
P=.04) in comparison with the low-intake drinkers.
Increased depression was associated with increased likelihood
of membership in the problem drinkers when compared with the
abstainers (OR=4.83, P=.01), low-intake drinkers (OR=4.87,
P=.01), and nonproblem drinkers (OR=12.50, P<.01), but these
relationships were only significant among those who were most
likely to be members of the loyal religiosity profile.Among those
most likely to be members of the apathetic profile, depression
significantly differentiated between likelihood of membership in
the nonproblem drinkers compared with the abstainers (OR=.48,
P<.001) and in the nonproblem drinkers compared with the low-
intake drinkers (OR=.61, P=.02). Depression did not differenti-
ate between any of the alcohol use profiles when conditioned on
the reserved religiosity profile.
The delinquency by depression interaction significantly
predicted likelihood of membership in alcohol use profile when
conditioned on likelihood of membership in the loyal
religiosity profile. (Certain ORs were undefined [see Table 6].
This was due to an extremely small cell size when examining
relationships between the delinquency by depression interac-
tion predicting likelihood of membership in the problem drink-
ers when conditioned on likelihood of membership in the loyal
religiosity profile [n=8; see Table 7].) Among those most likely
to be members of the loyal profile, the delinquency by depres-
sion interaction significantly differentiated among those most
likely to be members of the low-intake drinkers compared with
the nonproblem drinkers (OR=333.333, P=.01). This interac-
tion is graphically depicted in Figure 3. Overall, the magnitude
of the difference between probabilities of membership in each
profile increased as a function of increasing delinquency,that is,
individuals were more likely to be a member of the nonproblem
drinkers and less likely to be a member of the low-intake drink-
ers as delinquency increased. However, at low levels of depres-
sion, individuals were always more likely to be members of the
nonproblem drinkers, whereas at high levels of depression indi-
viduals were slightly more likely to be members of the low-
intake drinkers when they engaged in low levels of delinquency,
but were more likely to be members of the nonproblem drinkers
when they had high levels of delinquency.
Also, only among those most likely to be members of the
loyal religiosity profile, the delinquency by depression interac-
tion differentiated between those who were more likely to be
members of the low-intake drinkers compared with the

Condition refers to the conditions under which the relationship between delinquency/depression and alcohol use was examined. Unconditional models reflect the effect of
the predictor on differentiation among alcohol use profiles among all members of the sample. Loyal, Reserved, and Apathetic conditions reflect the effect of the predictor
on differentiation among alcohol use profiles, conditioned on the religiosity profile of interest (ie, the effect of delinquency on alcohol use only among those most likely to
be members of the loyal religiosity profile). All models control for demographic covariates.

depression level, the likelihood of membership in the
low-intake drinkers and abstainers decreased with increasing
delinquency. However, among those with high levels of depres-
sion, individuals were always more likely to be a member of the
abstainers, whereas at low levels of depression individuals were
more likely to be members of the abstainers when they also
engaged in low levels of delinquency,but were more likely to be
members of the low-intake drinkers when they engaged in high
levels of delinquency.
Discussion
This examination of behavioral antecedents to adulthood alco-
hol use suggests that adolescent delinquency and depression
may serve to differentiate typologies of alcohol users in adult-
hood and that the magnitude of these relationships may be
associated with one's likelihood of exhibiting unique patterns
of religious behaviors among self-identified Christians.
Delinquency
First, engaging in delinquent activities during adolescence was
related to an increased likelihood of heavier drinking in adult-
hood, irrespective of experiencing alcohol-related conse-
quences (represented by a high likelihood of membership in
the nonproblem drinkers and problem drinkers). However, these
effects were seen primarily among those who were likely to
demonstrate high mean item responses to religiosity-focused
indicators. These results support previous literature linking
adolescent delinquency to adult alcohol use64; however, these
results are indicative of a more nuanced relationship with
religiosity than has been expressed in previous litera-
ture.33,34,38,48,65,66 For instance, some may suggest that

encountering only a few individuals who were likely to be
members of both the loyal profile and problem drinkers is indic-
ative of a protective effect of religiosity against the effect of
delinquency on the development of problematic drinking pat-
terns (see Table 7). However, we see differential effects of
delinquency on likelihood of membership in the problem
drinkers across religiosity profiles, demonstrating that delin-
quency is still a risk factor for development of particular pat-
terns of alcohol use, and the extent of this risk may be
associated with particular patterns of religiosity.
There are a number of potential explanations for why such
nuanced associations were uncovered in this analysis. First, it
may be that those who are "more" religious (in this case, those
who identify as Christian and participate frequently in reli-
gious services and activities) experience psychologic reactance.
Reactance refers to one's tendency to act in a manner inconsist-
ent with prescribed behavior as retaliation against feeling that
one's autonomy has been challenged.67 Strongly religious indi-
viduals may feel that the behavioral mandates set by their reli-
gion (such as proscribing the consumption of alcohol) challenge
their individual autonomy and drink heavily as a response to
this perceived deficit of control. Previous studies have also
shown that national crime rates increase as a function of
national religiosity68 potentially due to religious individuals'
expectations to receive grace or be forgiven for committing
transgressions. It may be that individuals who are highly reli-
gious continue to take part in heavy drinking because they
expect to be forgiven for such behavior. Another potential
explanation is that those most likely to be members of the loyal
religiosity profile demonstrate a more "mature" religiosity that
permits nonhazardous drinking; future research should seek to
substantiate this theoretical possibility.
However,it is most likely that the person-centered approach
to examining religiosity in this study may provide a more robust
explanation of our findings. Although Benda and Corwyn65
posited that a multidimensional examination of religiosity may
reveal complex ways through which religiosity protects against
delinquency, previous studies have mainly applied variable-
centered approaches, using single item or composite measures
of religious service attendance, strength of evangelism (includ-
ing identity as a born-again Christian),personal religiosity,and
religious affiliation or church membership.38,48,65,66 These vari-
able-centered approaches assume that variables relate to each
other in the same way across all types of individuals,25,26 leaving
the potential for interactions among underlying facets of these
variables to remain latent. As such, it may be that the particular
pattern of religiosity demonstrated by members of the loyal
profile is not most effective in buffering against the influence
of delinquent peers. Other studies using person-centered
approaches to religiosity have inferred that qualitatively differ-
ent types of religious individuals engaged in varying levels of
delinquent behavior.51 As such, our analysis has replicated this
effect and has provided additional evidence that a synthesis of
varying levels of religious beliefs and practices (as opposed to
indices of low, medium, and high religiosity) could provide
additional information about characteristics of diverse indi-
viduals that is complementary to that obtained by a variable-
centered approach.
Depression
Depression was also predictive of particular types of adulthood
alcohol use. Adolescents who experienced more symptoms of
depression were (1) less likely to drink heavily and (2) more
likely to either abstain from drinking or to demonstrate a prob-
lematic pattern of alcohol use. As with delinquency, these rela-
tionships varied across religiosity profiles. Given that previous
research has found a negative relationship between adolescent
depression and adult alcohol use,5,12­14 the finding that depres-
sion in adolescence was related to decreased likelihood of
membership in low-consuming or abstaining profiles is not
surprising. Depressive symptoms, part of a larger category of
internalizing symptoms, may be associated with decreased
alcohol use in adulthood due to a later initiation into alcohol
use. Initiation into alcohol use is strongly tied to social interac-
tion,69 and because adolescents with depressive symptoms may
avoid social interaction, they may be less likely to begin drink-
ing, in turn decreasing their risk of developing maladaptive

of membership in the abstainers compared with the low-intake drinkers.

12 Substance Abuse: Research and Treatment
alcohol use patterns. However, that depression was also related
to an increased likelihood of problematic drinking patterns,
particularly among those who were most likely to demonstrate
strong engagement with religious behaviors, is of interest.
Although depression has been linked to an increase in prob-
lematic drinking, these effects have mainly been found during
adolescence.16 Future research must further investigate this
association to substantiate the nature of the relationship
between depression and alcohol use across time.
The results of this study do not necessarily provide support to
the presence of a direct internalizing pathway to alcohol use11 in
the context of alcohol use operationalized as a latent categorical
variable. Depression differentially predicted likelihood of mem-
bership in alcohol use profiles,and this change in operationaliza-
tion of alcohol use (ie, examining latent profiles of alcohol use
rather than indices of frequency/quantity of consumption) dem-
onstrates that depression may be related to lower likelihoods of
particular combinations of alcohol use behaviors, rather than
indices or alcohol use composite scores used in previous
research.70 Given that these results also differ according to the
pattern of religiosity one is most likely to exhibit, it may be that
the particular pattern exhibited by those most likely to be mem-
bers of the loyal religiosity profile is particularly protective against
the effects of depression on alcohol use.
Depression by delinquency interaction
Examination of the delinquency by depression interaction dem-
onstrated that among those most likely to be members of the
loyal religiosity profile, the likelihood of heavy drinking still
increased as a function of delinquency, but those who also
reported depressive symptoms were less likely to demonstrate
heavy drinking patterns than those who did not experience
depressive symptoms. These results suggest that delinquency
may be a more robust predictor of particular kinds of alcohol use,
such that delinquency is inversely related to abstaining or low
levels of consumption, but that the extent to which delinquency
predicts heavy alcohol use may be dependent on co-occurring
depressive symptoms. These findings substantiate those of
Colder et al,24 who found that externalizing problems were more
effective predictors of later alcohol use when adolescents were
only displaying externalizing problems. However, when exter-
nalizing problems were coupled with internalizing problems,the
relationship between these predictors and alcohol use was
weaker. It appears that while delinquency in adolescence indi-
cates that individuals may engage in some kind of alcohol use as
an adult, as has been previously demonstrated,5,12 the extent to
which this alcohol use will consist of binge drinking and/or
intoxication may be dependent on comorbid depression.
Limitations
These findings must be appreciated in light of a number of
limitations. First, membership in the loyal profile was related to
particularly strong and significant odds of membership in each
alcohol use profile when compared with the problem drinkers;
however, only 8 individuals were members of both the loyal
religiosity profile and the problem drinkers (see Table 7). So,
even though comparisons between the problem drinkers and any
other alcohol use profile within the loyal profile resulted in
extremely large and significant ORs, these results may be dif-
ferent if a larger cell size were available. However, considering
that when conditioned on likelihood of membership in the
loyal profile increased delinquency was still associated with
increased likelihood of membership in the nonproblem drinkers
when compared with the abstainers (a comparison with an
appropriate cell size, albeit demonstrating a slightly weaker
effect), it is likely that the general trend of results is valid,
although the true extent of the effect is in need of further rep-
lication. As such, we suggest that definitive conclusions about
the relationships between the predictors and alcohol use pro-
files using the problem drinkers as a reference group when con-
ditioned on membership in the loyal religiosity profile should
be made only after future work has replicated these results.
As with all secondary data analyses, we were limited to the
items available in the Add Health questionnaire. The indica-
tors used in the religiosity LPA assessed a limited number of
religious beliefs and behaviors,and the resulting religiosity pro-
files should be appreciated in light of the specific indicators
used. Along these lines, 2 available indicators reflect frequency
of attendance at religious services and at religiously affiliated
activities. These indicators may be more reflective of parents'
religiosity and church attendance, rather than the adolescent's
autonomous choice to attend services.33,71 Consequently, the
profiles may be different if other indicators were included. We
encourage future research in this area to examine profiles of
religiosity with different combinations of religious beliefs and
practices. Given that religiosity indicators were not assessed
among those who did not indicate affiliation with an estab-
lished religious tradition, we are also missing a very specific
demographic whose inclusion may have influenced the pat-
terns of religiosity present in the latent profiles. The observed
sample appeared to be quite religious, so these religiosity pat-
terns may not be representative of more secular populations. In
addition, religiosity was assessed in 1996, and the results may
not generalize to adolescents today (see the Pew Research
Center72 for an examination of societal changes in religiosity).
Finally, entropy in the religiosity LPA was lower than what is
typically accepted (see Table 4). This entropy value suggests
that we have greater classification error, which may cloud our
predictive ability. Because we did not use the results of the
religiosity LPA as a predictor or outcome in a 2-stage analysis
where classification error is more costly, we accepted the low
entropy value in this analysis with the understanding that cases
may not be perfectly classified.
Although we were able to assess the effects of adolescent
predictors on likelihood of membership in adult alcohol use
Hoyland et al 13
profiles across those who were likely to demonstrate 3 discrete
patterns of religiosity, we were unable to conduct a formal test
of moderation effects.Thus, care must be taken to avoid com-
paring the results of analyses conducted with respect to dis-
crete religiosity profiles and/or between individual religiosity
profiles and the full sample (ie, the unconditional model).This
is a current limitation of mixture modeling, but suggestive of
an area for potential methodologic development. Until such
procedures are developed, we are precluded from formally
assessing a mechanistic role of religiosity when conceptualized
as a latent categorical variable via traditional mediation or
moderation. Although our results are suggestive of a mecha-
nistic role of religiosity as a moderator, it will be prudent for
methodologists to reassess these results with additional meth-
ods. In addition, mixture modeling in general is a probabilistic
technique, which means we do not have complete certainty in
our religiosity profile assignments and alcohol use classifica-
tions.The profiles presented here should be regarded as proto-
typical item response patterns that have a high likelihood of
existing in the population.
An additional limitation is related to our examination of
delinquency and depression at baseline, religion 1
year post
baseline, and alcohol use outcomes 13years post baseline. This
leaves a large period of time unaccounted for, in which signifi-
cant events may have occurred but were not captured by data
collection.For instance,it may be that some individuals became
dependent on alcohol, subsequently went into treatment, and
are now represented in the abstainers; these individuals may be
qualitatively different from those who have never drank or
drink infrequently. Also, the reciprocal effects of delinquency
and depression may differentially influence adult alcohol use
profiles.73 Parallel process models that track these influences at
each time point may provide a more nuanced understanding of
how these intertwined factors predict alcohol use.
Other limitations include a reduction in sample from the
original, nationally representative Add Health sample.
Although such reductions were made to make meaningful
comparisons using all available data, this practice reduces the
generalizability of our findings. Such reduction in sample may
have influenced the examination of the protective effects of
religion on delinquency, similar to the ways in which the rela-
tionship between delinquency and religion varies depending on
the region of the country in which the sample is taken.74
Furthermore, the delinquency items had relatively low internal
consistency reliability. Although these items were selected to
specifically relate to dimensions of delinquency that have been
previously shown to be associated with religiosity and alcohol
use,36 future work should expand the dimensions of delin-
quency assessed to increase the reliability of this measure. In
addition, we did not include measures of socioeconomic status
in these analyses (eg, total household income and parental level
of education) because examining the effects of these factors
was beyond the scope of this project,thus limiting our ability to
account for additional environmental factors in the develop-
ment of alcohol use and the initial levels of adolescent delin-
quency. Finally, we did not account for a number of other
variables that have been related to the development of alcohol
use, such as social support,31 peer alcohol use,64 and self-regu-
lation.75,76 Future research should include additional auxiliary
variables,such as those just mentioned,to understand the com-
plex mechanisms through which these typologies develop
across time.
Conclusions
This is the first attempt to examine the role of latent profiles of
religiosity in internalizing and/or externalizing pathways to
alcohol use patterns. The results of these analyses suggest that
delinquency and depression are predictive of alcohol use pat-
terns, but such associations appear to vary among individuals
with different patterns of religiosity. Person-centered examina-
tions of religiosity, such as that used in this analysis, are perti-
nent, considering a societal trend of decreasing affiliation with
organized religion.50,72 Even though fewer Americans are
identifying with traditional religious denominations, this does
not mean that they avoid existential thinking or attendance at
religious activities; person-centered approaches will continue
to be useful to identify nuances in such patterns of unorganized
religious behaviors or beliefs. Future research should continue
examining the composition of adolescent religiosity profiles
across a wide range of religious and nonreligious individuals,
psychosocial correlates of those profiles, and the stability of
religiosity patterns over time.
In addition, we were able to replicate the alcohol use profile
structure previously identified by Donovan and Chung28 in
wave 1 of Add Health using data from the same sample of
individuals at wave 4.The persistence of this structure across a
span of 13years suggests that these profiles may remain stable
over time. However, we did not assess stability/change in pro-
file membership at the level of the individual (eg, were those
most likely to be members of the abstainers at wave 1 still most
likely to be members of the abstainers at wave 4?). By identify-
ing such patterns, and factors that may accounting for indi-
vidual variability in profile membership over time (eg,
self-regulation, stressful life events, and treatment seeking),
future studies may further inform our understanding of devel-
opmentally normative versus atypical drinking processes (eg,
are early nonproblem drinkers at increased risk of being subse-
quent problem drinkers?).
These results highlight the nuanced pathways through
which delinquency and depression influence subsequent pat-
terns of alcohol use, demonstrating the importance of examin-
ing antecedents to alcohol use within an individual's unique
environmental context. As such, to estimate the extent to
which religiosity may function as a protective factor against
alcohol use, those working with delinquent or depressed youth
must assess an individual's entire pattern of religiosity-focused
14 Substance Abuse: Research and Treatment
practices or behaviors. Further research is also needed to iden-
tify whether specific types of externalizing behaviors other
than delinquency (eg. antisocial behavior, aggression, and drug
use) or specific types of internalizing problems other than
depression (eg, social anxiety and excessive withdrawal) are
prospectively related to particular patterns of alcohol use so
