Abstract
Objective: Untreated hyperthyroidism and treatment with high doses of thyroid hormone are associ-
ated with osteoporosis. However, their effect on bone turnover, their contribution to bone mineral
density (BMD) in the context of other clinical risk factors for osteoporosis and the prevalence of ver-
tebral fractures is not well documented.
Design: Cross-sectional study.
Methods: We studied 59 patients receiving L-thyroxine suppressive therapy for differentiated thyroid
carcinoma (DTC). BMD of the hip was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and lateral DXA
pictures of the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae were performed. Bone resorption was measured by
C-telopeptides of type I collagen (ICTP) and bone formation by procollagen type I N-propeptide
(PINP). Clinical risk factors for osteoporosis were evaluated using a questionnaire.
Results: Z-scores of BMD were similar as the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey) III reference group in women and men, also after long-term (.10 years) suppression therapy.
Patients in the lowest and highest quartile of BMD showed significant differences in the presence of
clinical risk factors. ICTP levels were significantly higher than in age-matched controls, PINP levels
were not different. We found four patients with a prevalent vertebral fracture.
Conclusions: We conclude that patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma are not at increased
risk of developing low bone mass nor have a higher prevalence of vertebral fracture at least when
treated with relatively low doses of L-thyroxine.

Introduction
Patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC)
usually have a good prognosis and a near normal life
expectancy. After initial ablative treatment with radio-
active iodine these patients are treated with L-thyroxine
(L-T4) in relatively high doses in order to suppress
endogenous thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-levels
and to minimize potential TSH-mediated stimulation
of tumor growth (1, 2). Adequate monitoring of TSH
suppression has become possible since the development
of second and third generation TSH assays (3, 4). The
degree of TSH lowering required to obtain maximal
suppression of tumor growth has been subject of dis-
cussion (5­8). Most recommendations suggest main-
taining TSH levels lower than 0.1 mU/l (1), although
in recent guidelines TSH levels between 0.1 and
0.5 mU/l are recommended in case there is no residual
disease after 1 year in low risk DTC patients (9). Long-
term administration of supraphysiological doses of L-T4
may have adverse side-effects. In addition to physical
discomfort, loss of weight, atrial fibrillation and cardiac
dysfunction (10, 11), the possible negative effects on
bone mineral density (BMD) and bone remodeling
resulting in osteopenia and loss of bone strength are
an important issue (12). Several mechanisms may be
involved in the development of osteopenia secondary
to suppressive therapy with L-T4 such as direct or indir-
ect stimulation of osteoclast activity by this hormone.
Recently also direct effects of TSH on bone remodeling
have been described (13). TSH inhibits osteoclast for-
mation and survival and also inhibits osteoblast differ-
entiation, and is therefore a negative regulator
of skeletal remodeling. Loss of bone mass is a uniform

feature of overt hyperthyroidism; in several studies a
bone loss of 10­20% has been reported (14­16). A
history of overt hyperthyroidism is a risk factor for
hip fracture later in life (17, 18), and is one of the
causes of excess late mortality in previously hyperthyr-
oid patients (19). Symptomatic bone disease is not a
prominent feature of subclinical hyperthyroidism. How-
ever, mild (subclinical) hyperthyroidism in subjects
with multinodular goiter was associated with decreased
forearm bone density, while in postmenopausal women
with hyperthyroidism who were treated with methima-
zole a higher bone density of the distal forearm was
found compared with untreated women (20, 21). In
addition the risk of osteoporotic fractures may be
increased (22). Studies in patients with suppressive
L-T4 therapy for DTC have generated conflicting results.
Some authors (23­26) found no evidence of lower
bone mass in this patient group, while others reported
more or less deleterious effects on bone mass (27­29).
In most of these studies however, numbers were small,
patient selection was not well defined and characteriz-
ation of patients was limited. The aim of our study
was to evaluate the impact of long-term suppressive
therapy with L-T4 on BMD in a large cohort of well-
characterized patients with DTC, and in the subgroup
of patients with suppressive therapy for more than 10
years. In addition, the prevalence of vertebral fractures
was assessed using lateral spine radiographs and mar-
kers of bone formation and resorption were measured
in serum.
Subjects and methods
Patients
Between January 2002 and July 2003 all 85 patients
with DTC from the outpatient clinic of the University
Hospital Maastricht (Maastricht, The Netherlands)
were asked to take part in this cross-sectional study.
Sixty patients agreed to participate. They all had under-
gone total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine
ablation and were taking a suppressive dose of L-T4
(goal of therapy: TSH ,0.05 mU/l) for a median
period of 5 years (range 1­52 years). In the last 6
months prior to entering this study, TSH-levels were
below 0.05 mU/l in 32 patients and below 0.6 mU/l
in the remaining subjects (mean TSH in the total
group 0.06 mU/l, range ,0.05­0.6 mU/l). One patient
who had a TSH-level of 6.1 mU/l was excluded from the
study. Therefore complete data are available from 59
patients; written informed consent was obtained in
all. To affirm that this patient group was under con-
tinuous suppressive therapy with L-T4 we checked
serial serum TSH levels in a group of 32 patients with
suppressive dose of L-T4 for .5 years resulting in a
mean TSH of 0.06 mU/l (range ,0.05­0.35 mU/l).
The general characteristics of the patients studied are
summarized in Table 1. Of the 40 women, 26 were pre-
menopausal and 14 postmenopausal. All patients had
histologically proven differentiated papillary or follicular
thyroid cancer. FT4 levels were 21.9^3.3 pmol/l (refer-
ence parameter: 8­18 pmol/l) and the mean dose of
L-T4 therapy was 2.2^0.5 mg/kg/day. Ten patients
used avitamin D analogue and calcium supplementation
because of postoperative hypoparathyroidism. No
patient had taken estrogen replacement therapy or
bisphosphonates. Calcium intake of all patients was
assessed on the basis of a detailed dietary list. Risk factors
for osteoporosis as well as daily activities and exercise
were assessed by a validated questionnaire (30), in
which sports, daily and work activities are scored with
a minimum of zero and a maximum of eighteen. None
of the 25 patients who declined to participate had
impaired mobility or symptoms related to vertebral frac-
tures. Mean age of this group was 49 years and there
were seven postmenopausal women in this group.
BMD and morphometric measurements
BMD of the hip was measured by dual energy X-ray
absorption (DXA, Hologic QDR 4500, Hologic Inc.,
Bedford, MA, USA, NHANES-III reference group). The

hip was measured in the standard projection, and
results are reported for femoral neck, trochanter, and
total hip. No data on bone mineral density of the
lumbar spine were obtained. Standard procedures sup-
plied by the manufacturer for scanning and analysis
were performed. Calibration with the manufacturer's
spine phantom and quality control analysis was per-
formed daily. The coefficient of variation for BMD
measurements was 1.0%. A lateral radiograph of the
spine was made for evaluation of the presence of ver-
tebral fractures. This was done by one classified and
experienced person with morphometry. Anterior,
middle and posterior height were recorded in all ver-
tebrae from T4 to L4 (if possible). On the basis of
these morphometric measurements prevalent vertebral
deformity was defined as a reduction of height of 20%
or more (McCloskey­Kanis method; 31).
Laboratory assays
All serum samples were frozen at 220 8C immediately
after collection. All analyses were measured within
one badge at the same time to reduce variability.
Serum TSH was measured using the commercially
available delayed enhanced Lantanide fluorescence
immunometric assay (DELFIA-method, Perkin Elmer,
Wallac, Turku, Finland), measured on an automatic
immunoanalyser of the same manufacturer. Serum
FT4 was measured using a commercially available
solid phase fluoroimmunoassay (DELFIA-method,
Perkin Elmer, Wallac, Turku, Finland); the normal
reference range in our laboratory is 8­18 pmol/l. As
marker for bone formation procollagen serum level of
type I amino-terminal propeptide (PINP) was measured
and as marker for bone resorption serum level of car-
boxy-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen
(ICTP). PINP and ICTP were determined using commer-
cial RIA kits (Orion Diagnostica Oy, Espoo, Finland). For
PINP the interassay coefficient of variation was 3.2%,
the intraassay CV 2.5% and the lowest detectable con-
centration was found to be 0.4 mg/l. For ICTP the inter-
assay CV was 3.5%, the intraassay CV 2.3% and the
lowest detectable concentration was found to be lower
than 0.1 mg/l. Study samples were compared with
serum samples from age and sex-matched controls.
All gave informed consent. None of them were known
to have thyroid diseases, and all had normal physical
examination and normal results of routine lab
measurements.
Statistical analysis
Results are reported as means^S.D. or median and
(range) where appropriate. T- and Z-scores of the
femoral neck and total hip (using NHANES-III) were
calculated for the total group, for men, for pre- and
postmenopausal women, and for a group of patients
who received suppressive L-T4 therapy for 10 years or
more. Comparison between groups was done using Stu-
dent t-test with correction for multiple comparisons
among groups if the data were normally distributed
and by Kruskal­Wallis test if the data were not nor-
mally distributed. Pearson's correlations were used to
calculate the relationship between BMD and duration
of suppressive therapy. To assess the influence of con-
founding factors on the bone mineral density measure-
ments, a multiple regression analysis (stepwise method)
was performed with BMD of the total hip (Z-score) as a
dependent variable and known risk factors for osteo-
porosis (sex, weight below 60 kg, mother with hip frac-
ture, fractures in previous medical history,
postmenopausal state, and corticosteroid use), duration
of suppressive therapy, body mass index (BMI), calcium
intake, physical activity, L-T4 /kg/day, serum FT4, and
postoperative hypoparathyroidism as independent vari-
ables. Another multiple regression analysis (stepwise
method) was done with BMD Z-scores as dependent
variable and age, weight, L-T4 /kg/day, serum FT4,
number of risk factors and physical activity index as
independent variables. Patients in the highest and
lowest quartile of BMD T-scores were compared on pre-
sence of risk factors with a chi-square test. All analyses
were done using SPSS (version 11.5). P , 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

the three study groups (Table 2). Five patients (two
men, three postmenopausal women) had a T-score
# ­2.5 in the femoral neck or trochanter and thus
met the WHO-criteria for osteoporosis. Fifteen patients
had suppressive L-T4 therapy for ^ 10 years (median
14 yrs, range 10­52 yrs). Also in these patients no
difference in BMD relative to age-matched controls
(Z-score total hip: median 0.40 (range 21.3­1.4)
was observed, and no correlation was found between
the duration of suppressive therapy and BMD of the
hip (r ¼ 0.01, P ¼ 0.91). Moreover we compared the
group of subjects with TSH levels below 0.05 with
the patients who had a slightly higher TSH and these
groups were similar with regards to T-score and
Z-score of total hip. BMD of the hip was also not differ-
ent in patients with or without postoperative hypopar-
athyroidism (Z-score 0.49 vs 0.34), although the
Z-score of the femoral neck was slightly higher in
patients with postoperative hypoparathyroidism (0.70
vs 0.05, P ¼ 0.029). Data regarding the presence of
risk factors for osteoporosis and the daily calcium
intake and physical activities have been summarized
in Table 3. The activity index had a mean of nearly
ten reflecting an average in showing activities in this
patient group. The calcium intake is with a mean of
807 mg/day moderate and insufficient for the postme-
nopausal group (in which 1000­1500 mg is rec-
ommended to achieve zero calcium balance).
Multiple regression analysis, including age, weight,
L-T4/kg per day, serum FT4, number of risk factors
and physical activity, revealed that higher body
weight was a significant contributor to BMD of the
total hip as expressed as Z-score. There were 22
patients with in total 33 known clinical risk factors
(postmenopausal state, hip fracture mother, vertebral
fracture, fracture .50 year, body weight ,60 kg,
immobilization and corticosteroid use). Patients in the
lowest and highest quartile of BMD (T-score of the
total hip below 20.70, mean 21.4, and above 0.6,
mean 1.03) showed differences in the presence of clini-
cal risk factors as earlier defined: in the lowest quartile,
11 of 15 patients had one or more risk factors, in the
highest quartile, two of the 15 patients had any risk
factor (P ¼ 0.001) (Table 4).
Markers of bone formation and resorption
Results of the measurement of markers for bone turn-
over are summarized in Table 5. Relative to an age
matched control group, ICTP was increased by about
25% in all patient groups. PINP levels however, as
marker of bone formation, did not significantly differ
from the control group. Comparing patients with and
without postoperative hypoparathyroidism, markers of
bone formation (244%, P , 0.05) and resorption
(27%) were decreased in the hypoparathyroidism
group and this resulted in a slightly higher BMD
mainly in the femoral neck.
Vertebral fractures
Fifty-four lateral DXA pictures of the lumbar and thor-
acic vertebrae were of adequate quality for the identifi-
cation of vertebral fractures. Four patients were found
to have pre-existing vertebral fracture, i.e. 7.% of
patients; two men, one pre- and one postmenopausal
woman. These patients did not report earlier fractures
or pain episodes. All these patients had a BMD of the
hip within the age-matched reference range (Z-score
0.53^0.91).
Discussion
This study demonstrates that long-term suppressive
L-T4 therapy in patients with DTC does not result in
reduced bone mineral density of the hip, neither in
pre- and postmenopausal women nor in men. BMD,
expressed as Z-score, was not correlated with duration
of L-T4 therapy and even in patients with suppressive
therapy .10 years no significant decrease in BMD
was found. The goal of suppressive L-T4 therapy is to

maintain TSH levels ,0.05 mU/l with a high normal
FT4. In our study the dose needed to achieve this
level of suppression was 2.2 mg/kg of body weight per
day, which resulted in FT4 levels of 20% above the
upper limit of normal. In all studies on this subject in
which a significant bone loss was observed patients
used a 30­50% higher dose of L-T4 compared with
our patients (27­29, 32, 33). In a cross-sectional
study Kung et al. found significantly lower BMD in
the lumbar spine, femoral neck and trochanter
(218%, 212% and 213%) in a group of 34 postme-
nopausal women, and their L-T4 dose was 3.3 mg/kg
of body weight per day (28). The same group followed
a small group of 15 postmenopausal women (3.0 mg
L-T4/kg of body weight per day) and found a bone
loss of 6.7% in the total hip after 2 years (32), which
could be prevented by calcium supplementation
(1000 mg/day). Diamond et al. demonstrated a nega-
tive effect on BMD in both pre- and postmenopausal
women (n ¼ 24) (27) with a mean L-T4 dose of
2.8 mg/kg/day and found a significant correlation
between the total cumulative dose of L-T4 and BMD,
suggesting that overzealous L-T4 therapy may lead to
bone loss. Studies in which doses lower than
2.5 mg/kg body weight per day were used, including
the more recent study of Rosen et al. (24, 26, 34) did
not observe any negative effects on BMD. Before the
introduction of second and third generation TSH
assays in the late eighties, it was more difficult to moni-
tor suppressive L-T4 therapy, because the detection
limit was within the normal range. Therefore dosing
of L-T4 could not be titrated optimally and was prob-
ably unnecessarily high. These high L-T4 doses have
been shown to affect BMD (27­29, 32). The presently
available TSH assays are more sensitive and thereby
allow better dose titration, thereby preventing
unwanted loss of BMD. The presence of postoperative
parathyroid dysfunction could also contribute to the
low incidence of osteoporosis in our population. Para-
thyroid hormone (PTH) is generally thought to have a
net catabolic effect on bone, including a more pro-
nounced stimulatory effect on osteoclast than on osteo-
blast activity (35). Abugassa et al. found a higher bone
mass in the proximal femur, lumbar spine and distal
radius in a group of 13 patients treated with calcium
and/or dihydrotachysterol because of postoperative
hypoparathyroidism after thyroidectomy for DTC, com-
pared with patients with normal parathyroid function
after the same surgical procedure (36). We also found
in the ten subjects with postsurgical hypoparathyroid-
ism a significantly higher BMD of the femoral neck.
However the total hip measurements showed no differ-
ence between these two groups, and mean Z-scores in
the group without hypoparathyroidism were not
lower than the reference population. A total of five
patients met the WHO criteria for osteoporosis in the
measurements of total hip, trochanter or femoral
neck BMD. Our risk factor analysis indicated that this
group could be identified with the known clinical risk
factors such as postmenopausal state, mother with
hip fracture, fracture above 50 years, immobilisation,
corticosteroid use and low body weight. Although no
long-term effect on BMD was found, a significant
increase of bone resorption as measured by serum
levels of ICTP was observed. The marker of bone for-
mation PINP was not altered. Other studies in DTC
patients with suppressive L-T4 therapy reported an
increase in markers of both bone formation and resorp-
tion. Kung et al. reported increases in hydroxyproline in
the urine of 130% and osteocalcin levels of 150% (28)
suggesting increased bone turnover. It is not clear why
this change in balance between bone formation and
bone resorption in our patients did not lead to bone
loss in the longterm. Perhaps the increase in bone
resorption is not substantial enough to affect BMD.
One might also speculate that the compliance with
L-T4 therapy might be lower in between hospital
visits (37, 38). Also a catch-up effect might have
occurred in the periods of thyroid hormone withdrawal
and subsequent hypothyroidism for diagnosis or treat-
ment of recurrent or metastatic disease. Vertebral frac-
ture is a hallmark of osteoporosis. Only one of the
previous studies in patients with DTC has evaluated
prevalent vertebral fractures in a very small group
(n ¼ 12) and reported no significant difference in the
incidence of spinal deformity between TSH-suppressed

patients and nonsuppressed patients (39). We found
four patients in this group (7%) with one or more ver-
tebral fractures defined as a reduction of 20% or more
of the anterior, middle or posterior height. In a very
large cross-sectional population based study on the
prevalence of vertebral deformity in European men
and women (EVOS) in a group of 15 570 males and
females aged 50­79 years, a prevalent vertebral
deformity was observed in 12% (range 6­21%) (40).
We report 7% in a group with lower mean age; these
patients did not have any clinical sign of vertebral frac-
ture nor did they have a lower BMD of the hip.
Although the group is small we have no indication
that the prevalence of vertebral fracture is higher
than in a European reference population.
We conclude that L-T4 therapy in doses which sup-
press TSH just below the detection limit of a second
generation TSH assay, did not result in significant
bone loss in our studied population and probably also
not in increased fracture risk. We suggest that specific
screening for osteoporosis in this patient group is there-
fore not recommended, other than on the basis of the
known clinical risk factors.
