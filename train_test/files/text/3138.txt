Introduction
In emotion regulation, the term emotion suppression
includes "unhealthy emotion regulation" as one of its com-
mon forms (John and Gross, 2004). Emotion suppression
produces more negative, not positive, emotions and more
inauthentic feelings (Cheung and Park, 2010; Gross and
John, 2003; Park et al., 2010). From these negative psycho-
logical aspects, suppression relates to higher levels of
depressive symptoms, lower levels of life satisfaction, and
less social support (English et al., 2012; Gross and John,
2003). Despite its common occurrence, emotion suppres-
sion involves psychological, social, cognitive, and physio-
logical costs, contributing to higher levels of stress.
Nevertheless, relatively few theory-driven studies have
examined how emotion regulation serves as an explanatory
mechanism in the etiology of specific psychological disor-
ders such as perceived stress. However, during the last few
decades, research on anger regulation within emotion regu-
lation has increasingly focused on perceived stress.
According to Spielberger (1999), the definition of anger
regulation applies to those people who often experience
anger; however, people do not always express their anger
outwardly. In fact, the various ways in which one can
express anger are critical variables. Therefore, in this study,
it is essential to distinguish expressions of anger, social
anxiety, and personality differences in an individual's
proneness to anger regulation in its effect on perceived
stress. The exploratory function and role of anger regula-
tion can be divided into three dimensions: anger suppres-
sion, outward anger expression, and controlled anger
expression. However, the effects of these dimensions of
anger regulation--anger suppression (anger-in (AI)), out-
ward anger expression (anger-out (AO)), and control of
anger expression (anger control (AC)) together--individu-
ally and socially, as mediated by social anxiety on per-
ceived stress, have not been extensively examined in
cross-cultural research.
Therefore, this study examined the cultural underpin-
nings of these three approaches to anger regulation and per-
ceived stress, mediated by social anxiety. First, the study
reviews the social science literature regarding relationships

Abstract
The mediating role of social anxiety was explored within the effect of anger regulation on perceived stress in the national
sample of American and Japanese older adults. Results indicated that anger suppression is a significant factor in perceived
stress mediated by social anxiety. Anger suppression was also directly related to perceived stress. The correlation of
anger suppression with social anxiety was stronger in Japan than in the United States. Understanding both universal
and culture-specific aspects of emotion regulation and perceived stress will be essential for the development of sound
theory, future research, and effective prevention and intervention efforts.

Culture and emotional control: anger regulation
Culture plays an important role in socially shared and trans-
mitted information systems, which are reinforced by norms,
values, beliefs, and everyday practices. In general, people in
European­American cultures differ widely from people in
East Asian cultures in how they view emotions, mostly urg-
ing other members of their culture to control feelings through
emotional regulation. Cultures are characterized by empha-
sis on either independence or interdependence (Markus and
Kitayama, 1991, 1994). Markus and Kitayama (1991, 1994)
suggest that independent self-construal refers to autonomy,
uniqueness, and the personal aspects of one's self-concept,
such as traits. In contrast, interdependent self-construal refers
to interpersonal aspects of self-concept, such as social expec-
tations, social harmony, and social and group memberships.
European­American cultures, which value highly independ-
ent self-construal, are more likely to emphasize the self as
separate from the social context and to focus on autonomy,
independence, and individual self-esteem, which constitute
independent self-construal. East Asian cultures, which
encourage highly interdependent self-construal, are more
likely to emphasize the self as a constituent of a broader
social context. East Asian cultures' concept of self encom-
passes characteristics and qualities of the social environ-
ment, social expectations, social harmony, social and group
memberships, and collective self-esteem, which constitute
interdependent self-construal (Singelis, 1994).
People in East Asian cultures tend to control their emo-
tions and feelings more frequently than do people in
European­American cultures. In East Asian cultures, emo-
tional control can have various meanings. A more concrete
and differentiated theoretical framework for addressing
individual differences could focus on emotional control in
emotional regulation, particularly anger regulation. For
example, people in European­American cultures with high
independence are more likely to value uniqueness and indi-
vidual self-expression strongly, and they are more likely to
encourage other members of their culture to express their
inner thoughts and feelings openly. However, people in
East Asian cultures with high interdependence are more
likely to treat the self as fundamentally connected to others.
Thus, people in East Asian cultures are more likely to value
conformity and cooperation strongly, and they are more
likely to encourage other members of their culture to
control thoughts and feelings that might interfere with
interpersonal harmony. Therefore, people in European­
American cultures are less likely to use anger suppression
frequently than are people in East Asian cultures. Such
regulation influences anger expression of core aspects,
such as emotions linked to self-construal (English et al.,
2012; Gross and John, 2003).
Anger regulation refers to regulation of one emotion. In
this study, anger regulation is divided into three types:
anger suppression (AI), outward anger expression (AO),
and controlled anger expression (AC). First, anger suppres-
sion (AI) is defined as the inhibition of anger. In suppress-
ing anger, individuals regulate their feelings in their minds;
for example, they withdraw from others, pout, or sulk
(Spielberger, 1999). Anger suppression is recognized as
one function of anger regulation, but it has also been asso-
ciated with conflict avoidance, guilt, irritability, rumina-
tion, depressive symptoms, and decreased life satisfaction
and subjective well-being (Gross and John, 2003; Martin
and Dahlen, 2007; Park et al., 2010). Therefore, anger sup-
pression might be related to mental health problems that
lead to high levels of perceived stress. Second, outward
anger expression (AO) is defined as the expression of anger
toward others. In this case, individuals express their feel-
ings of anger outwardly; for example, they slam doors and
say nasty things. Previous research findings show that out-
ward expression of anger is likely to reduce negative emo-
tionsandparadoxicallypromoteshigherlevelsofwell-being
and lower perceived stress (English et al., 2012; Gross and
John, 2003). Third, controlled anger expression is defined
as the primary reduction of the internal experience of anger,
and run the risk of ignoring the adaptive functions of anger.
These experiences of anger are more likely to fail to recog-
nize the importance of experience of anger in order to allow
the physiological and psychological processes with the
accompanying the anger experience to affect their experi-
ence. Thus, the difficult emotions and complexities can be
absorbed, and other experiences and behaviors can proceed
as normal (Whelton, 2004).
Proposed model
This study aims to obtain a better understanding of the rela-
tionship role among three types of anger regulation--anger
suppression (AI), outward anger expression (AO), and con-
trolled anger expression (AC)--and social anxiety on per-
ceived stress for older American and Japanese adults in a
cross-cultural context. In particular, this study seeks to
ascertain the degree to which people engage in social anxi-
ety as mediator and then determine influences that such
thought processes exert on levels of perceived stress. Thus,
the study expects three types of anger regulation and social
anxiety to be associated with levels of perceived stress
across cultures. The study's measures might address the
role of the cross-cultural outlook as it influences reports of
Yamaguchi et al. 3
perceived stress. Figure 1 provides a graphical presentation
of the conceptual model that links these factors.
Method
Participants
This study used mainly Midlife in the United States
(MIDUS) Project 4 of the second wave of MIDUS (i.e.
MIDUS II) for US participants. MIDUS II contains longi-
tudinal follow-up data from MIDUS I. For the US partici-
pants of MIDUS II, the subsample (N=1255) of the original
MIDUS study (MIDUS I) was used. This study can use
only MIDUS II Project 4 since some measurements and
scales of MIDUS I are irrelevant to this study. In this study,
the US participants were 542 males and 713 females, aged
35­86years (M=57.32, standard deviation (SD)=11.5).
The Japanese participants were the parallel data set of
MIDUS, called Midlife in Japan (MIDJA) (N=1027).
Japanese participants were 505 males and 522 females aged
30­79years (M=54.3, SD=14.1).
In 2008, a comparison sample of middle-aged Japanese
adults was obtained. Many of the same psychological vari-
ables measured in the MIDUS II data set were measured in
the Japanese data set, including the measures of independ-
ent and interdependent self-construal. Original MIDUS
scale items were translated and then back-translated by
native Japanese speakers (Park et al., 2013).
Analysis plan
This study aimed to explore the relationship among anger
suppression, outward anger expression, and controlled
anger expression in anger regulation, social anxiety, and
perceived stress. We developed a model using structural
equation modeling (SEM) to specify relationships among
these variables. Then, we examined findings to determine
whether the model was equal to pass coefficients from each
factor among older American and Japanese adults. Next,
we examined whether all-factor patterns appeared among
older American and Japanese adults. To address this issue,
we tested the model by conducting an SEM analysis with
the software AMOS SPSS for Windows (Bentler, 1990).
Regarding the model fit index scores, for example, we cal-
culated the goodness of fit (GFI) using a covariance matrix.
Raykov et al. (1991) suggested calculating SEM results
using four fit indices--GFI and comparative fit index
(CFI)--and the root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA). A model fit of .95 and above and an RMSEA of
.06 or less signify a good model fit (Bentler, 1990; Bollen,
1989; Hu and Bentler, 1999). Akaike information criterion
(AIC) is a comparative measure of fit, and so it is meaning-
ful only when two different models are estimated. Lower
values indicate better fit, and so the model with the lowest
AIC is the best (Akaike, 1973). Finally, our data analysis
relied primarily on the pass coefficient significance test and
the critical ratios for differences between parameters to
address culturally specific pathway models and culturally
different patterns.
Measurement instruments
This study assessed anger regulation to measure angry feel-
ings with the State Trait Anger Regulation Inventory
(STAXI; Spielberger, 1999). The STAXI integrates two
previously developed inventories: the State Trait Anger

Scale and the Anger Regulation (AX) Scale. Five inde-
pendent subscales constitute the STAXI: state anger, trait
anger, anger suppression (AI), outward anger expression
(AO), and controlled anger expression (AC). A sixth scale
constitutes three subscales designed to measure patterns of
anger suppression and outward anger expression (AI and
AO), as well as the frequency of an individual attempting to
control his or her anger expression (AC), with each state-
ment on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree)
to 7 (strongly agree). Anger suppression (AI) refers to the
extent to which one can control one's angry feelings or sup-
press angry or furious feelings, or lose one's mind. The
anger suppression (AI) scale has eight subscale items.
These items are as follows: in general, when I feel angry or
furious (1) I withdraw from people; (2) I pout or sulk; (3) I
am angrier than I am willing to admit; (4) I am secretly
critical of others; (5) I boil inside, but do not show it; (6) I
harbor grudges; (7) I keep things in; and (8) I am irritated
more than others are aware. Outward anger expression
(AO) refers to the extent to which one can express one's
angry or furious feelings, or lose one's mind. The outward
anger expression (AO) scale has eight subscale items.
These items are as follows: in general, when I feel angry or
furious (1) I slam doors; (2) I say nasty things; (3) I make
sarcastic remarks; (4) I argue with others; (5) I lose my tem-
per; (6) I strike out at whatever infuriates me; (7) I express
my anger; and (8) If someone annoys me I tell them how I
feel. The controlled anger expression (AC) refers to one's
ability to control one's angry or furious feelings, or lose
one's mind, in the context of physical or verbal expression
and communication. The controlled anger expression (AC)
scale has four subscale items. These items are as follows: in
general, when I feel angry or furious (1) I control my tem-
per; (2) I keep my cool; (3) I calm down fast; and (4) I make
threats. Cronbach's alphas were .80 (AI), .75 (AO), and .69
(AC) in the United States and .75 (AI), .80 (AO), and .70
(AC) in Japan. Thus, these measurement models were
accepted because all the relevant indices had good values in
this study. The mean scores were 14.65 (AI), 12.01 (AO),
and 9.92 (AC) in the United States and 14.16 (AI), 12.17
(AO), and 7.94 (AC) in Japan.
This study used the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale to
measure social anxiety, that is, a comparison of the psycho-
metric properties of self-report and clinician-administered
formats (Fresco et al., 2001). This scale has nine subscale
items, and we asked the participants to indicate their degree
of agreement with each statement on a 7-point scale rang-
ing from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). It has
nine subscale items: (1) Talking to people in authority; (2)
Going to a party; (3) Working while being observed; (4)
Calling someone you don't know well; (5) Talking with
people you don't know very well; (6) Being the center of
attention; (7) Expressing a disagreement or disapproval to
people you don't know very well; (8) Returning goods to a
store; and (9) Resisting a high-pressure salesperson.
Cronbach's alphas were .85 in the United States and .89 in
Japan. Thus, these measurement models were accepted
because all the relevant indices had good values in this
study. The mean score was 1.83 in the United States and
1.83 in Japan.
In addition, this study employed the Perceived Stress
Scale to measure stress status (Cohen et al., 1983). This
scale has 10 subscale items, and we asked the participants
to indicate their degree of agreement with each statement
on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7
(strongly agree): In the last month, how often have you (1)
been upset because of something that happened unexpect-
edly? (2) felt that you were unable to control the important
things in your life? (3) felt nervous and stressed? (4) felt
confident about your ability to handle your personal prob-
lems? (5) felt that things were going your way? (6) found
that you could not cope with all the things that you had to
do? (7) been able to control irritations in your life? (8) felt
that you were on top of things? (9) been angered because of
things that were outside of your control? (10) felt difficul-
ties were piling up so high that you couldn't overcome
them? Cronbach's alphas were .86 in the United States and
.76 in Japan. Thus, these measurement models were
accepted because all the relevant indices had good values in
this study. The mean score was 22.24 in the United States
and 26.11 in Japan.
Results
Preliminary analyses
Descriptive statistics for this study's sample are presented
in Table 1. The study used SEM to develop a model that
specifies relationships among the relevant variables. We
then analyzed findings to determine whether SEM results
were equal to pass coefficients for each factor among the
samples of older American and Japanese adults. In addi-
tion, we examined whether all-factor patterns emerged
among the samples. Confirmatory factor analysis specified
the model using AMOS 18 (Arbuckle, 2009); chi-square
and GFI values of data were then used in conjunction with
Table 1. Means and standard deviations for study measures in
the United States and Japan.

the model (Byrne, 2001). Since previous cross-cultural
research findings generally identify cross-cultural differ-
ences between individualistic and collectivistic groups in
terms of perceived stress levels and assessments, differ-
ences were possible between older American and Japanese
adults in our sample in terms of anger regulation and rela-
tionships among these variables.
We tested whether patterns of all-factor loadings were
identical between older American and Japanese adults; in
addition, confirmatory factor analysis established meas-
urement equivalence of anger expression between these
two cultural groups. Two hierarchically nested models
were compared as follows: an unconstrained model (free
constrained model), in which no constraints were placed
on factor loadings between the two cultural groups, and a
constrained one, in which the factor loadings were con-
strained to be equal for the two groups. First, the uncon-
strained model (free constrained model) provided a good
fit for the chi-square test: 2(1072)=6533.379, p<.001
(CFI=.812, GFI=.846, RMSEA=.047; AIC=6769.379).
Second, when the factor loadings were constrained to be
equal between the two cultural groups, the fit was no
worse for the chi-square test: 2(1101)=6878.024, p<.001
(CFI=.801, GFI=.839, RMSEA=.048; AIC=7056.024).
Results scarcely differed from those for the unconstrained
model (free model) (Figure 2).
These findings establish factor equivalence between the
two cultural groups. The results indicate that the measure-
ment model was metrically equivalent between the two cul-
tures and that it could thus serve as a baseline in subsequent
analyses (Cheung and Rensvold, 2002). The covariance
among AI, AO, and AC was significant at p<.001, save for
AO to AC for the older Japanese adult sample. This is the
most parsimonious model still to provide excellent data
(Byrne, 2001; Hoyle, 1995).
Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess correla-
tion analysis with the key (latent) variables in the American
and Japanese samples. Table 2 displays the study's correla-
tion matrix; as one can see, most of the correlations were
significant at p
<
.001. Ultimately, this study explored the
relationship between each of the three types of anger regu-
lation (AI, AO, and AC) and social anxiety in terms of per-
ceived stress.
Main analyses
Our intention was to develop an anger regulation mediation
model using a cross-cultural approach, with social anxiety
serving as a mediator between anger regulation (AI, AO,
and AC) and perceived stress. To test for any culture-spe-
cific pathways in the proposed path model, we constrained
all paths to be equal across the US and Japanese samples.
The study's primary objective was to propose and test a
model delineating the process by which the three types of
anger suppression--AI, AO, and AC--influence perceived
stress. The model also incorporates social anxiety as the
potential mediating factor for perceived stress. The study
performed a path analysis to test the integrated model.
Figure 2 lists the path coefficients within such a model.

To address cross-cultural differences and commonalities
in cross-cultural variations in the proposed model, the study
employed critical ratio tests to calculate and evaluate the
difference between the two cultural groups, using the same
parameters. The results showed culturally general or simi-
lar processes and culturally different processes in the path
model (Figure 3). Furthermore, the results identified the
role of social anxiety as a mediator in the relationship

between anger regulation (anger suppression, outward
anger expression, and controlled anger expression) and per-
ceived stress. For example, the common processes are the
relationship between controlled anger expression and social
anxiety in relation to perceived stress, and between con-
trolled anger expression and perceived stress. The study
also found cross-cultural differences in relationships
between anger suppression and social anxiety in relation to
perceived stress and between anger suppression and per-
ceived stress. Cross-cultural differences emerged in the
covariance between anger suppression and outward anger
expression, between outward anger expression and con-
trolled anger expression, and between anger suppression
and controlled anger expression.
Discussion and conclusion
This study mainly clarified the role of social anxiety medi-
ated by the relationship between the three types of anger
regulation and perceived stress. The results indicated that
the relationship between anger suppression (AI) and per-
ceived stress mediated by social anxiety was the result of
cross-cultural differences between the United States and
Japan. Compared to people in the United States, people in
Japan are more likely to suppress their anger and to experi-
ence social anxiety, leading to high levels of perceived
stress. This study identified the role of social anxiety medi-
ated by the relationship between AO and perceived stress in
the United States, not in Japan, as an indirect effect. In the
United States, people who tend to express their anger out-
wardly are less likely to feel social anxiety leading to high
stress levels, but not in Japan. This study clarified the role
of AO and perceived stress as the direct path effect in the
United States, but not in Japan. This study also investigated
social anxiety mediated by AC and perceived stress in the
United States as an indirect effect, but not in Japan. In the
United States, people who tend to control their anger are
less likely to feel social anxiety, which leads to high levels
of stress, but not in Japan. This study also identified the role
of AC and perceived stress as direct path effects in the
United States, but not in Japan.
This study identified pathways of the relationship
between anger suppression (AI) in anger regulation and per-
ceived stress mediated by social anxiety resulting from
cross-cultural differences between the United States and
Japan. Our theoretical framework led us to distinguish three
approaches to anger regulation and to hypothesize the rela-
tionship among these approaches and perceived stress medi-
ated by social anxiety. The study found that anger
suppression was a significant factor in perceived stress
mediated by social anxiety as the hypothesized indirect
effect. Anger suppression was also related to perceived
stress as the hypothesized direct effect. The correlation
between anger suppression and social anxiety was stronger
in Japan than in the United States. Thus, this study found
that, primarily, the role of anger suppression in the three
approaches to anger regulation reflects cross-cultural differ-
ences between the United States and Japan.
This integrated approach allowed us to examine the the-
oretical model's external validity, as well as its culture-spe-
cific boundary conditions. The study's main findings are
unique in that they represent the first attempt to explore this
emotion regulation model with social anxiety of cross-cul-
turally perceived stress among middle-aged people in the
United States and Japan. The SEM results showed that
anger suppression was a significant factor of the effects of
social anxiety on perceived stress among middle-aged peo-
ple in the United States and Japan.
These novel findings build upon, and are consistent
with, emerging research in emotion regulation. First, our
applied model, based on the model of emotion regulation
(Gross and John, 2003), extends this theoretical work by
providing initial empirical evidence of the model's applica-
bility to older American and Japanese adults. The media-
tion model's generally good fit demonstrated that anger
suppression does entail costs in regard to mental health out-
comes--specifically, perceived stress. This is consistent
with prior findings that emotion suppression is often asso-
ciated with negative psychosocial consequences (Gross and
John, 2003).
Third, the results represent an important contribution
toward building an empirical knowledge base of three dis-
tinct approaches to anger regulation (anger suppression,
outward anger expression, and AC). This study also found
that, to reduce their social anxiety, those who have high
anger suppression (AI) with independence and uniqueness
tend toward low levels of perceived stress in US samples.
This sample comprised middle-aged American and
Japanese adults, and perhaps these age groups are more
likely to be concerned with their in-group (e.g. family)
counterparts than with younger generations.
Our findings might suggest that the dominant, self-
focused manifestation relates to social anxiety as a social
phobia within the Western cultural context. In contrast, the
dominant other-focused manifestation relates to social anx-
iety as a social phobia within East Asian cultural contexts,
such as Japan (Russell, 1989), which are more likely to be
other-focused (Nakamura et al., 2002); this could be due to
excessive concern about embarrassing oneself in public.
The primary concern of socially anxious people is the
potential to offend, which drives them to avoid others and
causes trouble for others as a result of inappropriate behav-
iors (Norasakkunkit et al., 2012). This study's main contri-
bution is to advance understanding of the function and role
of anger suppression, outward anger expression, and social
anxiety in regard to lower levels of perceived stress. The
effects and role of anger suppression and outward anger
expression on low levels of perceived stress were clarified.
Our findings indicate that indirect effects of anger suppres-
sion and outward anger expression on perceived stress also

have a direct effect on anger suppression and perceived
stress in older American and Japanese adult samples. The
results indicate that anger suppression and outward anger
expression should not be ignored when considering social
anxiety as the key factor that triggers perceived stress
(Bhawuk and Brislin, 1992).
Methodologically, this study addressed some gaps in the
current literature on emotion regulation. Given prior rec-
ommendations (John and Gross, 2004), we closely exam-
ined regulation of one discrete emotion (namely, anger)
rather than studying emotion regulation globally. The focus
on anger was also advantageous from a cultural perspec-
tive, in that this emotion has demonstrated extensive vari-
ability across cultures in terms of its psychological and
social impacts (Markus and Kitayama, 1991). Very little
empirical research has investigated the role of cultural con-
text; this study was, therefore, precisely designed to do so.
Finally, we used confirmatory factor analysis to test the
relationship between the variables of interest.
Overall, this study explored a theoretical model of emo-
tion regulation (Gross and John, 2003) and its effects on
perceived stress mediated by social anxiety in nationally
representative older American and Japanese adult samples.
These study findings are among the first to test this mod-
el's cross-cultural applicability. Moreover, the results
highlighted the importance of cultural context in demon-
strating moderation of the anger suppression­depression
link based on interdependent self-construal. Understanding
both the universal and the culture-specific aspects of emo-
tion regulation's role in the development of depression and
other forms of psychopathology is essential to enable
effective prevention and intervention efforts across diverse
populations.
Limitations and implications for future
study
The study's limitations should also be explained to help
advance further research. First, this study relied primarily
on self-reported measures and scales, and thus, various data
collection methods should be used to make the findings and
information useful in further research. Second, since the
nationally representative data sets were limited to the
United States and Japan in terms of cultural variations, for
further study, data should be obtained from different loca-
tions and regions, such as European countries, Asian coun-
tries (with the exception of Japan), and/orAfrican countries.
Third, this study indicates that anger suppression and out-
ward anger expression have unique pathways to perceived
stress mediated by social anxiety across cultures. Anger
suppression and outward anger expression might not be
contextual and culture-dependent, but rather universal, and
they could be further elicited by environmental cues
(Oyserman, 2011); therefore, this study could suggest
implications of increasing and developing perceived stress
mediated by social anxiety. For example, since this study
found associations among anger suppression, outward
anger expression, controlled anger expression, and social
anxiety and identified effects of perceived stress, such prac-
tical implications might be the necessary first step in fur-
ther research. Fourth, the cross-sectional research design is
limited to discerning causal foundations. To address this
issue, a longitudinal research design and data should be
used to identify causal foundations.
The findings in this study may have important clinical
and practical implications. Further research should focus
on health status. Interventions should be different across
cultures with respect to health status and conditions. This
study suggests that we need to create a counseling interven-
tion program that considers cross-cultural differences and
validations of symptoms of depression. For Euro-
Americans, interventions should increase the sense of con-
trol, which may originally come from cultural affordances.
For Asians, interventions should be based on relational ori-
entations and socially supportive networks, which may
originally come from cultural affordances. For example,
according to Uchida, Kitayama, Mesquita, Reyes, and
Morling (2008), indigenous psychotherapies in Japan, such
as naikan therapy, are more likely to emphasize the cultiva-
tion of a patient's reflective awareness of his or her depend-
encies and indebtedness to others (Ishiyama, 1986). Such
therapies and intervention programs in Japan may be effec-
tive and consistent with American therapies that focus on
self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977).
Further research is needed with clinical populations.
One salient idea is that developing compassion, which is an
aspect of Buddhist theory, and understanding ideas of lov-
ing kindness toward self and others in counseling and ther-
apy may be important for an individual in promoting
emotional well-being and obtaining a better health status.
In addition, further research is needed to explore how to
achieve this, in that those who are highly self-critical and
may have experienced little warmth in their daily lives may
find it frightening to be compassionate to the self (Uchida
et al, 2008).
In conclusion, this study might be able, conceptually
and operationally, to increase our understanding of per-
ceived stress in different cultural contexts; more specifi-
cally, the proposed model of perceived stress should focus
on individuals' anger suppression, outward anger expres-
sion, and controlled anger expression because these self-
views serve as clues to other cultural and individual values
and behaviors that fit into perceived stress, health, and
well-being.
