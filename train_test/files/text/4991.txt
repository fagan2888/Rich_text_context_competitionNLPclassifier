Meta-Analysis
The impact of RAGE
inhibition in animal models
of bacterial sepsis:
a systematic review
and meta-analysis
Xin Zhao, Yan-nian Liao and Qian Huang
Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the impact of inhibition of the receptor for advanced glycation end
products (RAGE) on the outcome of bacterial sepsis in animal models.
Methods: Relevant publications were identified by systematic searches of PubMed, ISI Web of
Science and Elsevier-Scopus databases.
Results: A total of Eleven studies with moderate quality were selected for analysis. A meta-
analysis of survival rates revealed a significant advantage of RAGE inhibition in comparison with
controls (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52­0.86). This effect was most pronounced in polymicrobial infection
(HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14­0.55), followed by Gram positive (Gþ) bacterial infection (HR 0.70, 95% CI
0.50­0.97) and Gram negative (GÀ) bacterial infection (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.58­1.38). For Gþ
bacterial infection, RAGE inhibition decreased bacterial outgrowth and dissemination, inflamma-
tory cell influx, plasma cytokine levels, and pulmonary injury.
Conclusions: RAGE inhibition appears to have a beneficial impact on the outcome of sepsis in
animal models, although there are discrepancies between different types of infection.

Introduction
Sepsis is a profoundly damaging and life-
threatening condition in clinical practice.
Although its true incidence remains
unknown, conservative estimates suggest
that sepsis is a leading cause of mortality
and critical illness worldwide. Moreover,
with the increased prevalence of antibiotic
resistance, aging populations with more

comorbidities, and the wider use of
immunosuppressive therapies, the burden
of this disease is expected to grow.1
According to the published guidelines of
the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, sepsis is
defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunc-
tion that is caused by dysregulation of host
responses to infection. Septic shock is a
subset of sepsis in which there is circulatory,
cellular and metabolic dysfunction, and is
associated with a higher risk of mortality.2
Understanding the pathophysiology of
sepsis is an important first step in improving
outcomes. Despite prioritization of sepsis
research over the past two decades, the
precise inflammatory dynamics of sepsis
are still not completely understood, and
innovations in the management of sepsis
have been slow to appear. Consequently,
there is an urgent need to further investigate
the underlying pathophysiology of sepsis,
and to develop new treatment strategies.
The receptor for advanced glycation end
products (RAGE) is a member of the
immunoglobulin superfamily. This super-
family engages numerous ligands and exhi-
bits expression on many cells types.3
Previous studies have demonstrated that
RAGE is a critical component of the dele-
terious effects of acute inflammatory dis-
orders, including sepsis. Binding of ligands
to RAGE can trigger several intracellular
signaling cascades, leading to translocation
of NF-kB. In turn, NF-kB induces RAGE
expression in a positive feedback loop. This
leads to amplification of pro-inflammatory
signaling, sustained cellular inflammation,
cellular dysfunction and tissue damage.4
Consequently, RAGE might be a promising
target for sepsis control strategies.
Inhibition of RAGE expression or activ-
ity has been found to reduce inflammatory
responses in several animal models, includ-
ing models of diabetic atherosclerosis,
delayed-type hypersensitivity and collagen-
induced arthritis.5 However, it has not yet
been determined whether RAGE inhibition
is beneficial in sepsis, as previous studies
have yielded conflicting results. Several
studies have suggested that RAGE inhib-
ition attenuates the systematic inflammatory
response and ensuing organ damage.3,4
Other studies have showed that RAGE
inhibition causes an enhanced outgrowth
of bacterial flora at the primary site of
infection, together with increased spread to
distant body compartments.5,6 To address
these discrepancies, we performed a system-
atic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the
impact of RAGE inhibition on the outcome
of sepsis in animal models.
Materials and methods
Literature search
The literature included in our analysis was
selected from PubMed, ISI Web of Science
and Elsevier-Scopus databases in April 2017.
The search terms ``receptor for advanced
glycation end product'' or ``RAGE'' were
used in combination with words related to
sepsis, namely ``sepsis'', ``septic'', ``bacterial
infection'' or ``bacteremia''. We also manu-
ally extended our search to include the
bibliographic reference lists of the research
articles included in our study and relevant
review articles.
Eligible studies and data extraction
Eligible studies had to meet all the following
criteria: (1) in vivo controlled studies using
an animal model with a sepsis challenge; (2)
the intervention group was homozygous
RAGE knockouts (RAGEÀ/À), RAGE het-
erozygotes (RAGEþ/À) or wild-type (WT)
animals treated with anti-RAGE antibodies;
(3) sepsis was induced by bacterial infection;
and (4) the article was published in English.
The major reasons for exclusion of studies
were: (1) other methods of RAGE inhibition
were used, such as administration of soluble
RAGE (sRAGE), that not only block the
RAGE pathway, but also other pathways
12 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
related to sepsis, such as toll-like receptor
pathways; (2) the data were overlapping;
and (3) full texts of the publications were not
available.
Two authors (Zhao X and Liao YN)
independently extracted the data from all
eligible studies, including the first author,
publication year, country, RAGE inhibition
method, method of sepsis induction,
infection type, antibiotics applied and
basic experimental animal information.
Discrepancies between the two authors in
terms of study inclusion and data extraction
were resolved by discussion among all
authors.
Quality assessments of included studies
A checklist modified from the Collaborative
Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of
Animal Data from Experimental Studies
(CAMARADES) was used to assess the
methodological quality of the included stu-
dies.7 One point was tallied for written
evidence of each of the following criteria:
peer-reviewed publication, randomization
of subjects into treatment groups, blind
assessment of outcomes, monitoring of
physiological parameters such as blood
pressure, calculation of the sample size
necessary to achieve sufficient power, state-
ment of compliance with animal welfare
regulations, avoidance of anesthetic agents
related to outcome of sepsis, statement of
potential conflicts of interest, and use of a
suitable animal model.
Statistical methods
If appropriate comparisons between the
RAGE inhibition group and control group
were available for a selected study, a meta-
analysis was conducted. Otherwise, a
descriptive review of the identified evidence
was carried out. For the survival rate, a
hazard ratio (HR) is recommended as the
most appropriate statistic because it allows
for differences in sample size and time to an
event. However, no study reported HR
directly, so an alternative method for
extracting summary statistics from survival
curves was used for the meta-analysis of
time-to-event outcomes.8 We also con-
ducted a subgroup analysis for three differ-
ent microbial infection types: polymicrobial
infection, Gram positive (Gþ) or Gram
negative (GÀ). A P-value less than 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Statistical analysis was performed using the
Review Manager (RevMan5.3) package
provided by the Cochrane Library.
Results
Descriptions of the included studies
The comprehensive search strategy on the
impact of RAGE inhibition on sepsis in
animal models resulted in 852 records. After
duplicates were removed, 376 studies
remained. After title and abstract screening,
32 full-text studies were screened.
Ultimately, 11 studies were included in
our systematic review and meta-analysis
(Figure 1).9­19 Lutterloh et al.10 investigated
the effects of RAGEÀ/À, RAGEþ/À, and
anti-RAGE antibody administration on
sepsis separately; these experiments were
treated as three separate studies.
Ramsgaard et al.13 and Achouiti et al.18
also used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce
sepsis to examine RAGE inhibition. These
results were also included in this analysis.
The characteristics of all included studies
are summarized in Table 1. These charac-
teristics varied considerably between the
studies, particularly the method used to
induce sepsis. Three studies used
Escherichia coli, two studies used cecal liga-
tion and puncture (CLP), two studies used
Streptococcus pneumoniae, two studies used
Staphylococcus aureus, two studies used LPS
in additional experiments, one study used
Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the remaining
study used Acinetobacter baumannii.

Methodological quality of included studies
Overall, the quality score for the eleven
included studies was moderate (mean 5.3),
with scores ranging from 5 to 7. No study
described the randomization of animals into
treatment groups, nor the sample size
calculation to achieve sufficient power.
Only one study reported monitoring of
physiological parameters, and only
two studies stated that the outcome meas-
ures were assessed by experimenters
who were blind to the treatment condition
(Table 2).
Overall analysis of survival rate
Six of the studies presented Kaplan-Meier
survival curves comparing the RAGE inhib-
ition group and the control group following
sepsis.9­11,15,18,19 The data extracted from
the survival curves is summarized in Table 3.
Meta-analysis of these studies revealed that
the RAGE inhibition group had a signifi-
cantly higher survival rate than the control
group (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52­0.86,
P ¼ 0.001). Heterogeneity for this out-
come was moderate (P ¼ 0.10, I2 ¼ 42%;
Figure 2).
Subgroup analysis of survival rate
We conducted a subgroup analysis per
infectious type. For polymicrobial infection,
meta-analysis of two studies (including five
experiments)9,10 revealed that RAGE inhib-
ition had a significant survival benefit over
the control (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14­0.55,
P ¼ 0.0002). No statistical heterogeneity was
found for this outcome (I2 ¼ 0%, P ¼ 0.71).
For Gþ bacterial infection, meta-analysis of
two studies11,15 also demonstrated a signifi-
cant survival benefit for RAGE inhibition
over the control (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50­
0.97, P ¼ 0.03), and moderate statistical
heterogeneity was found for this outcome
(I2 ¼ 28%; P ¼ 0.24). For GÀ bacterial infec-
tion, meta-analysis of two studies18,19
revealed that RAGE inhibition had a
higher survival rate than the control,
although the difference was not statistically
significant (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.58­1.38,
P ¼ 0.60; Figure 2). Moderate statistical
heterogeneity was found for this outcome
(I2 ¼ 21%; P ¼ 0.26).

Bacterial outgrowth and dissemination
Nine studies described the impact of RAGE
inhibition on bacterial outgrowth or dissem-
ination during sepsis. For polymicrobial
infection, Lutterloh et al.10 showed that
there were no significant differences in
tissue colony counts in liver, spleen and
peritoneal tissue between the RAGE
inhibition group (including the RAGEÀ/À,
RAGEþ/À and anti-RAGE antibody admin-
istration groups) and the control group. For
Gþ bacterial infection, although van Zoelen
et al.11 and two studies by Achouiti et al.
found that RAGE inhibition reduced bac-
terial outgrowth or dissemination to distant
organs, another study by Achouiti et al. did
not observe this effect.15­17 For GÀ bacterial

infection, van Zoelen et al.12, Tadie et al.14
and Achouiti et al. all found that RAGE
inhibition promoted bacterial outgrowth or
dissemination. However, Noto et al. found
that RAGEÀ/À mice had significantly
reduced bacterial burdens in comparison
with WT mice.18,19
Inflammatory cell influx
Nine studies investigated the impact of
RAGE inhibition on inflammatory cell
influx during sepsis. For polymicrobial
infection, Liliensiek et al. found reduced
numbers of inflammatory cells adherent to
the peritoneum of the RAGEÀ/À group
compared with that of the WT group.9 For
Gþ bacterial infection, van Zoelen et al.11
and one study from Achouiti et al. found a
decreased influx of inflammatory cells in the
RAGEÀ/À group compared with the WT
group. However, another study from
Achouiti et al. did not show this alter-
ation.15,16 For GÀ bacterial infection,
although Ramagaard et al. found signifi-
cantly decreased inflammatory cell counts in
the RAGEÀ/À group compared with the WT
group, van Zoelen et al.12, Tadie et al.,
Achouiti et al. and Noto et al. did not
observe such a difference.13,14,18,19 Two
studies also reported that RAGEÀ/À mice
challenged with LPS had the same degree of
inflammatory cell influx as WT mice.13,18
Plasma cytokine levels
Six studies reported the impact of RAGE
inhibition on plasma cytokine levels during
sepsis. For polymicrobial infection,
Liliensiek et al. found that the plasma
cytokine levels did not differ significantly
between the RAGEÀ/À group and the WT
group.9 For Gþ bacterial infection, van
Zoelen et al.11 found that interleukin (IL)-6
was reduced in the RAGEÀ/À group, while
Achouiti et al. found that tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-a and IL-6 were both reduced
in the RAGEÀ/À group.15 For GÀ bacterial
infection, van Zoelen et al.12, Achouiti et al.
and Noto et al. all found that the anti-
inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was elevated in
the RAGEÀ/À group.18,19

Pulmonary injury
Five studies reported the impact of RAGE
inhibition on pulmonary injury during
sepsis. For Gþ bacterial infection, both van
Zoelen et al.11 and Achouiti et al. found
reduced pulmonary injury in the RAGEÀ/À
group compared with the WT group.16 For
GÀ bacterial infection, although Ramsgaard
et al. showed that the RAGEÀ/À group had
reduced pulmonary injury, both van Zoelen
et al.12 and Achouiti et al. found no signifi-
cant differences between the comparison
groups.13,18
Discussion
RAGE functions as a sensor of danger
signals, triggering a certain degree of inflam-
matory reactions. This process can act as a
double-edged sword during sepsis, on the
one hand protecting the host against invad-
ing pathogens; however, destroying cells and
tissues.20 In this comprehensive systematic
review and meta-analysis, we analyzed and
described the effects of RAGE inhibition on
the sepsis survival rate in animal models.
The overall meta-analysis showed that
RAGE inhibition was associated with a
significantly higher survival rate than the
control (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52­0.86,
P ¼ 0.001). However, this therapeutic effect
varied greatly during subgroup analysis of
the type of infection. The effect was most
pronounced in polymicrobial infection (HR
0.28, 95% CI 0.14­0.55, P ¼ 0.0002), fol-
lowed by Gþ infection (HR 0.70, 95% CI
0.50­0.97, P ¼ 0.03) and GÀ bacterial infec-
tion (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.58­1.38, P ¼ 0.60).
One possible explanation for the intriguing
observation that RAGE inhibition during
different types of infections had differential
effects on survival is that RAGE-mediated
bacterial clearance might be pathogen
dependent. To test this hypothesis, systemat-
ically reviewed the impact of RAGE
inhibition on bacterial outgrowth and
dissemination. As expected, RAGE inhibition
reduced bacterial outgrowth and dissemin-
ation to distant organs during Gþ bacterial
infection, and to a lesser extent during GÀ
bacterial infection. Previous in vitro studies
support these findings. Peritoneal macro-
phages harvested from RAGEÀ/À mice have
an increased capacity to kill S. pneumoniae
(a Gþ bacterium), whereas RAGEÀ/À neu-
trophils have a reduced ability to phagocyt-
ose K. pneumoniae (a GÀ bacterium).11,18
Taken together, these data suggest that the
impact of RAGE inhibition on survival rate
and bacterial clearance is likely to be at least
in part determined by the specific micro-
organism involved.
For polymicrobial infection, the detected
survival benefit was not associated with
reduced bacterial outgrowth and dissemin-
ation.12 This may be partly explained by
previous findings showing that the host
defense against CLP depends on the extent
of intestinal necrosis and formation of a
local abscess.21 Consequently, the impact of
RAGE inhibition on bacterial clearance
might not be easily determined using this
sepsis model.
Mortality from sepsis is thought to be a
consequence of excessive inflammatory cell
influx into the infection site, combined with
an over-production of pro-inflammatory and
anti-inflammatory cytokines in the blood. All
these inflammatory alterations contribute to
tissue damage, multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome (MODS), and secondary oppor-
tunistic infections.22 Thus, we also conducted
a systematic review of inflammatory cell
influx, plasma cytokine levels and pulmonary
injury between the RAGE inhibition and
control groups. We found that RAGE inhib-
ition was associated with reduced inflamma-
tory cell influx, plasma cytokine levels and
pulmonary injury during Gþ bacterial infec-
tion, and these parameters correlated with
enhanced survival.
It is still unclear whether RAGE interact
with ligands from pathogens and whether
18 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
the RAGE-induced effects in first-line
defense mechanisms are pathogen depend-
ent. If so, then these mechanisms might
explain the opposite effects of RAGE inhib-
ition on survival, bacterial clearance and
inflammatory reactions observed with dif-
ferent methods of sepsis induction.
However, such mechanisms remain specula-
tive and require further investigation to
confirm their existence.23
Lutterloh et al. found that an anti-RAGE
antibody protected mice from mortality in
CLP induction of sepsis, and the survival
benefit was comparable to that of a RAGE
gene knockout. Furthermore, the anti-
RAGE antibody enhanced survival even
when administration started up to 24 h
after CLP.10 Studies investigating the effects
of sRAGE, which acts as a decoy receptor,
in murine CLP-induced sepsis found that
sRAGE administration improved the 7-day
survival rate compared with controls.9,24 We
did not include studies involving sRAGE in
our analysis due to its interaction with
receptors other than RAGE itself.
However, these studies combined suggest
that anti-RAGE antibodies and sRAGE
might be attractive therapeutic agents for
treating sepsis in clinical settings.
Some limitations of our systematic review
and meta-analysis are worth noting. First,
there is more bias in systematic reviews of
animal models than in clinical trials.
According to the CAMARADES checklist,
the overall quality of the studies included in
this analysis was not particularly good.
Second, the number of studies that met our
inclusion criteria was small, and the limited
data available was insufficient for certain
comparisons, such as subgroup analysis.
Third, the literature was unclear as to
which experimental approach was most
appropriate for evaluating the effects of
RAGE inhibition on sepsis in animal
models. Various methods were used for
inducing sepsis in these studies, and includ-
ing all types of experimental sepsis together
in this analysis could overestimate or under-
estimate the role of RAGE inhibition.
Fourth, we also found various RAGE
inhibition methods, including RAGE gene
knockout, or administration of anti-RAGE
antibody or sRAGE. Because of its inter-
actions with multiple receptors, sRAGE-
related studies were excluded. However, this
inevitably excluded some valuable informa-
tion. Fifth, the different methods of collect-
ing samples, time points, and outcome
measurement criteria in the included studies
would have contributed substantially to the
high heterogeneity. Sixth, the authors did not
report any information about the stage of
sepsis and whether septic shock was present
in the animals studied. The state of sepsis
could be an important consideration when
evaluating the therapeutic value of RAGE
inhibition. Seventh, many of the studies were
carried out by groups that were led by the
same senior investigator, which might limit
the generalizability of the results.
Conclusions
Based on the results of our analysis, RAGE
inhibition enhances survival in animal
models and may protect against sepsis.
Therefore, RAGE may be a promising
therapeutic target for treating sepsis clinic-
ally. However, the observation that RAGE
inhibition is beneficial in sepsis that is
induced by one method and ineffective in
another suggests that RAGE-mediated
pathogen defenses may rely on distinct
mechanisms. Further investigations are
needed to define the role of RAGE inhib-
ition in different infectious conditions.
