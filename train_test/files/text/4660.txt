Many countries in the past years have seen protest move-
ments expressing their anger at the influence of money in
politics. This has been accompanied by a surge in research
examining how corruption affects political behavior (cf.
Klasnja et al., 2016). Studies show that factors such as
information, the economy, and partisanship influence the
degree to which voters punish corrupt politicians. But law-
makers who engage in corruption do so for various rea-
sons. Take the example of India, where politicians who
become rich while holding office are not hard to find.
Among the most high-profile cases are the former telecom-
munications minister A. Raja, who is accused of accepting
millions of dollars in bribes, and the Chief Minster of
Tamil Nadu, Jayaram Jayalalitha, who was convicted for
illegally amassing "disproportionate assets" in excess of
$10 million over five years in office.1
But money from corrupt transactions is also used in
other ways: "Parties and candidates tend to use their term of
office to accumulate war chests for future elections and for
nursing their constituencies. There is evidence that they
raise these resources through any means available, includ-
ing through corrupt means such as kickbacks for regulatory
and allocative favors while in office." (Gowda and
Sridharan, 2012: 236). In Indian elections, candidates often
try to buy votes by distributing cash, liquor, and small gifts
(Kapur and Vaishnav, 2011; Krishna, 2007; Wilkinson,
2007). This has certain welfare consequences: an article in
Bloomberg View calls Indian general elections a "quasi-
Keynesian boost (...) rich with multiplier effects from
boardroom to tea shop."2
Do voters judge politicians who engage in corruption
differently depending on what they use the money for? In
this article, I present evidence that this is indeed the case. I
show results from a survey experiment conducted on a rep-
resentative sample of voters in Delhi, India. Respondents
were asked about a politician who accepted money for a
political favor. One treatment group was told that the politi-
cian used this money to personally enrich himself (personal
corruption), while the other was informed that he used it to
buy votes (electoral corruption). Respondents were then
asked how much they supported different punishments the
politician could face. Those who received the vote buying
treatment were clearly and consistently less likely to agree

corruption: Experimental evidence

Abstract
A growing literature examines the effect of corruption on political behavior. However, little attention has been paid so
far to the fact that politicians engage in it for various reasons and with different welfare consequences. In this article, I
argue that voters judge corrupt politicians differently depending on what the money is used for. I show results from a
survey experiment in India in which respondents heard about a politician who accepted money for a political favor. One
treatment group was told that the politician used the money to personally enrich himself (personal corruption), while
the other group was informed that he used it to buy votes (electoral corruption). Respondents who received the vote
buying treatment were clearly and consistently less likely to agree with a series of potential punishments. This suggests
that the overall welfare consequences of corrupt exchanges are an important factor when voters decide how to judge
offending politicians.

with a series of potential punishments. The welfare conse-
quences of corrupt exchanges thus are an important factor
when voters decide how to evaluate offending politicians.
This can help explain the central puzzle of the literature,
namely that corrupt incumbents are often treated with leni-
ency by voters (Golden, 2010; Golden and Mahdavi, 2015).
I also show that the differences between the two treatments
are larger among wealthier respondents, even though they
are less likely to benefit from vote buying efforts. This sug-
gests that the effect is not necessarily driven by narrow self-
interest, but instead by a sociotropic evaluation of the
overall welfare consequences of personal and electoral cor-
ruption among parts of the electorate.
This article contributes to the literature on the effect of
corruption on political behavior, which so far has mainly
focused on how environmental factors condition voters'
responses to corrupt politicians. For example, studies dem-
onstrate the impact of information (Chong et al., 2015; Ferraz
and Finan, 2008; Winters and Weitz-Shapiro, 2013; Chang
et al., 2010), the state of the economy (Klasnja and Tucker,
2013; McCann and Domínguez, 1998; Zechmeister and
Zizumbo-Colunga, 2013), political partisanship (Anderson
and Tverdova, 2003; Anduiza et al., 2013; Eggers, 2014),
clarity of responsibility (Tavits, 2007), and the level at which
corruption is experienced (Gingerich, 2009; Klasnja et al.,
2016). I complement the literature by drawing attention to
the fact that the welfare consequences of corrupt exchanges
matter as well.3 The article therefore is also part of a recently
emerging literature that disaggregates corruption and special
interest money (e.g. Bussell, 2013; Gingerich, 2014;
Kaufmann and Vicente, 2011; Nyblade and Reed, 2008).
The paper relates most closely to two recent observa-
tional studies. Manzetti and Wilson (2007) find that support
for governments perceived as corrupt among World Values
Survey respondents is negatively related to the strength of
government institutions. This is interpreted as evidence that
voters in countries with strong patron­client relationships
are more likely to support corrupt politicians, since they
expect to receive tangible benefits. However, countries
with low institutional strength differ from those with high
strength in many other ways than their level of clientelism.
More directly, Fernández-Vázquez et al. (2016) examine
the reelection probabilities of Spanish mayors involved in
corruption scandals. They show that only representatives
whose corrupt dealings had no welfare enhancing conse-
quences (e.g. embezzlement) saw a decrease in their reelec-
tion probabilities. If there were positive side benefits for
voters (e.g. jobs through licensing illegal construction pro-
jects), there was no punishment. One worry with such an
observational study is that politicians may select the type of
corruption they engage in strategically, for example based
on characteristics of the electorate.4 I contribute to this line
of inquiry by providing direct experimental evidence of the
micro-level mechanisms behind these findings, net of any
potential confounders.
The article also speaks to contributions showing that
voters tend to tolerate corruption when the offending poli-
tician delivers good results otherwise (Klasnja and Tucker,
2013; Muñoz et al., 2012; Rundquist et al., 1977).5 In con-
trast to these "implicit exchange" accounts, I provide evi-
dence for a more explicit exchange that involves the usage
of money obtained from a corrupt transaction itself.
Finally, my findings are relevant for the literature on clien-
telism, and in particular for the debate about its welfare
consequences. Clientelistic competition is not considered a
normative ideal and has many negative effects (e.g.
Magaloni, 2006; Stokes, 2005). However, in countries
where the state provides few public goods, these payments
are one of the only tangible benefits that especially poor
citizens get from the political system (Auyero, 1999;
Gonzalez Ocantos et al., 2014). I show evidence that
voters do indeed recognize that clientelism has certain
welfare-enhancing effects.
Survey experiment design
In this article, I focus on India, a country which currently
ranks 85th out of 174 countries in Transparency
International's Corruption Perception Index and 130th out
of 189 in the World Bank's ease of doing business ranking.6
It is widely acknowledged that political corruption is very
common (Bussell, 2012; Gowda and Sridharan, 2012;
Kapur and Vaishnav, 2011). Furthermore, as the examples
above make clear, it happens for several reasons. Many
politicians use their tenure in office to enrich themselves
(Fisman et al., 2014). But election campaigns are increas-
ingly costly, with clientelistic expenditures making up a
large part of the tab. Candidates need to invest considerable
resources to be serious contenders (Gowda and Sridharan,
2012; Kapur and Vaishnav, 2011). India is thus an ideal set-
ting to investigate the impact of corrupt money for personal
enrichment versus vote buying.
The survey experiment for this study was conducted as
part of a larger survey in the National Capital Territory of
Delhi in January 2014. Respondents were selected from the
voter roll in a multi-step process. First, 10 of 70 assembly
constituencies in Delhi were chosen randomly. Second, five
polling stations from each constituency were sampled.7
Finally, for each polling station, 20 voters were selected
from the official electoral roll published by the Chief
Electoral Officer of Delhi.8 They were assigned to one of
two treatments in alternating order.
·
· Personal Enrichment Treatment: Imagine a politi-
cian who received money from a company for a
political favor. He used this money to personally
enrich himself. What do you think the consequences
should be?
·
· Vote Buying Treatment: Imagine a politician
who received money from a company for a
Weschle 3
political favor. He used this money to buy votes in
an election. What do you think the consequences
should be?
Both prompts are formulated in a neutral manner. In
particular, the vote buying one does not stress who the
recipients are or what benefits they receive. Instead, it sim-
ply refers to vote buying, which is illegal under Indian law,
just like personal enrichment in exchange for a political
favor. Note that I use a fictional rather than a real politi-
cian. While this comes with the downside of greater
abstraction, previous research shows that pre-existing atti-
tudes such as partisanship affect how much punishment
voters exert for the same corruption offense. This is likely
also true for ethnicity or, in the Indian context, caste. To
abstract from these specifics, experimental studies of cor-
ruption typically ask respondents to evaluate fictional poli-
ticians, and I follow this convention.
Also note that the experiment does not have a control
condition asking about a corrupt politician without giving
any information about what the money was used for. The
experiment thus cannot tell us whether the personal enrich-
ment and vote buying treatments differ from a generic cor-
ruption allegation. But as the examples mentioned above
indicate, corruption cases are rarely generic. They are usu-
ally discovered based on irregularities resulting from how
the illegal money is used, so there are reports about politi-
cians who increase their personal assets while in office, or
who call in favors to engage in vote buying. In addition to
not corresponding to many real-world situations, a generic
corruption allegation would also introduce the amount of
information a respondent receives as a second condition
into the experiment. Because the goal is to tease out the
effect of personal versus electoral corruption, I focus on
comparing two conditions that hold constant the amount of
information given.
After receiving the treatment statements, participants
were presented with three punishments.
·
· A politician who took money for political favors to
[buy votes/enrich himself] should have to resign
from his position.
·
· A politician who took money for political favors to
[buy votes/enrich himself] should be banned from
contesting future elections.
·
· A politician who took money for political favors to
[buy votes/enrich himself] should be sentenced to
time in jail.
For each statement, respondents were asked whether they
agreed completely, agreed, neither agreed nor disagreed,
disagreed, or disagreed completely. In addition to this
experimental treatment, the survey asked about a number
of political issues and included a standard battery of demo-
graphic questions. Interviews were conducted face-to-face
in Hindi by trained interviewers of a Delhi-based polling
company. If a sampled voter was unavailable, a replace-
ment in the same locality and of the same gender and age
group was selected. In total, 993 interviews were com-
pleted. The sample is balanced for most variables, with two
small exceptions.9 To ensure that they do not drive the
results, I account for them in various ways below.
Finally, it is important to note the context the survey was
conducted in. In December 2013, the month before the sur-
vey, an anti-corruption party called the Aam Aadmi Party
successfully competed in state elections for the Delhi
assembly. The party gained almost 30 percent of the votes.
It subsequently formed a minority government, which
lasted from December 2013 to February 2014. This means
that the survey experiment was conducted while an anti-
corruption party was in power. Corruption therefore prob-
ably had a higher than average salience among its
respondents. This makes it likely that they condemn corrupt
practices more than would be the case in another place or at
another time. But since the focus here is not on how much
voters disapprove of corrupt politicians, but instead on
whether their disapproval differs depending on what the
money was used for, this should not limit our ability to
draw inference.
Analysis
As an initial step, I treat the respondents' answers to the
three questions as continuous going from one (agree com-
pletely) to five (disagree completely). The first thing to
note is that tolerance for politicians who accept special
interest money for political favors is low, no matter how it
is used. Most respondents agree or agree completely that a
politician who engages in such behavior should be pun-
ished. The means in the entire sample are 1.43 (the politi-
cian should resign), 1.54 (the politician should be banned
from contesting future elections), and 1.48 (the politician
should be jailed). This was expected given the location and
timing of the survey during the administration of an anti-
corruption party.
Table 1 shows the means of the two treatment groups
for the three response variables. Despite the high overall
disapproval of corruption, the means are consistently
smaller for respondents who were given the personal
enrichment treatment compared to those who received the
vote buying treatment (a lower number means more sup-
port for punishment). On the scale from one to five,
respondents who received the personal enrichment treat-
ment are on average between 0.124 (jail) and 0.247
(resign) points more supportive of punitive measures.
These differences are significant at conventional levels,
both when using uncorrected p-values as well as when
accounting for multiple hypothesis testing using
Benjamini­Hochberg corrections. Put the other way
around, people are more tolerant of politicians accepting
4 Research and Politics 
money in exchange for political favors when it is distrib-
uted to the population in an attempt to buy their support.
Of course, it is not clear that the response variables can
be treated as continuous. Figure 1 shows the share of
respondents who agree completely with the punishment
statements for the personal enrichment treatment (gray) and
the vote buying treatment (white). Again, it is apparent that
there is widespread disapproval of the politician's behavior.
However, the share of respondents agreeing completely
that he should resign, be banned, and be jailed is consist-
ently larger for those who received the personal corruption
treatment. These differences are statistically significant at
conventional levels (see Table 2 in the Online Appendix).
Because there are slight imbalances between the two treat-
ment groups, I also estimate a series of regressions that control
for demographic variables. Table 2 shows the coefficient of
the vote buying treatment from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
specifications with controls, constituency fixed effects, and
standard errors clustered by polling station. The coefficients
can be interpreted as the differences in means between the two
treatments, controlling for demographic and constituency
effects. Their magnitudes are actually larger than when look-
ing at the raw differences, ranging between 0.178 (jail) and
0.285 (resign). In the Online Appendix, I present a series of
additional model specifications as robustness checks. I also
account for the imbalances in the treatment assignment groups
by pre-processing the data using matching. In all cases, and for
each dependent variable, the coefficient of the vote buying
treatment is positive and significant at conventional levels.
The fact that voters are more lenient with vote buying
politicians begs the question what the reason behind this
finding is. Is it driven by the egocentric self-interest of vot-
ers who usually are among the beneficiaries of clientelistic
politics? Or is it because voters think about the sociotropic
welfare consequences for society as a whole? Table 3
shows the effect of the two treatments separately for
respondents in the lower and upper income halves. Because
vote buying efforts primarily target the poor (e.g. Stokes,
2005; Weitz-Shapiro, 2012), respondents in the upper
income half are less likely to benefit personally from it.
Nevertheless, they are consistently more lenient with the
vote buying candidate. Respondents in the lower income
half, however, are only significantly less punitive for the
vote buying politicians when it comes to the mildest form
of punishment (resignation). For the other two punish-
ments, the differences between the treatments are smaller
and not significant. This suggests that the effect is not nec-
essarily driven by narrow self-interest. Instead, it mainly
comes from wealthier (and more educated) respondents
differentiating the overall societal welfare consequences
of personal and electoral corruption.10
Conclusions
One of the main advances in the study of corruption in
recent years has been the disaggregation of the catch-all
concept. Scholars now distinguish between bureaucratic
and political corruption, petty corruption and grand corrup-
tion, personal and electoral corruption, and so on. Not only
are these conceptually distinct (e.g. Bussell, 2013;
Gingerich, 2014; Warren, 2004), they also have different
welfare consequences. The survey experiment presented
here contributes to this line of inquiry. It shows that voters
are less willing to punish politicians engaging in a corrupt
exchange if its proceeds are then "shared" with the wider
electorate. This can help explain the central puzzle that
motivates the literature, namely why voters frequently ree-
lect incumbents they know to be corrupt (Golden, 2010;
Golden and Mahdavi, 2015).
In future research, it will be necessary to replicate the
survey experiment in different contexts to determine its
empirical scope. Are voters generally more tolerant of vote
buying, or are there situations where they are not? How
does the magnitude of the effect differ, especially between
different income levels? More broadly, (illegally) provid-
ing favors in exchange for money used to buy votes or for
personal enrichment are only two ways in which special
interest money enters politics. Others include (legal)

campaign contributions, sponsored retreats and other travel,
or lucrative post-government employment. What are their
welfare consequences, and how do voters evaluate politi-
cians engaged in them? Answering these questions will fur-
ther advance the growing literature on different types of
corruption as well as the study of its effects on political
behavior. Ultimately, this will help us understand when vot-
ers punish corrupt politicians, and when they give them a
free pass instead.
