Abstract
Background and methodology Unintended pregnancy
is a concern in the USA due to its association with adverse
physical, mental, social and economic outcomes. Few
studies have examined this issue among married women
from a social and contextual perspective. This study
targeted married women to examine factors associated
with unintended pregnancy using the ecological model of
health promotion that focuses attention on both individual
and social environmental factors. Data from the National
Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) were merged with
NSFG contextual files to examine the major predictive
factors.
Results Multilevel logistic regression modelling revealed
that married women of lower socioeconomic status,
higher parity, who lived in communities with a high rate of

Introduction
Reduction in the rate of unintended pregnancy in the USA
is a national health priority. Progress in the reduction of
unintended pregnancy has been difficult to achieve among
women of childbearing ages. The Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) reported that in 1995, 48% of all
pregnancies were not intended; by 2002 the percentage of
unintended pregnancies slightly increased to 49%.1
Although the rates remained stable, disparities have been
noted in terms of race, age, marital status and
socioeconomic status.2 The national Healthy People 2010
target for the general population of women in the USA for
intended pregnancies, set at 70%,3 will not be met.
Unintended pregnancy is associated with significant
and costly physical, psychological and socioeconomic risks
to both mother and child.4,5 Children born as a result of an
unintended pregnancy are more likely to be premature,
have a low birth weight, and are at increased risk for child
abuse.2,6,7 Women who experience an unintended
pregnancy are more likely to have inadequate prenatal
care,7 a lower educational level, and live in poverty.2,8
Although unintended pregnancy is higher among
unmarried women, little attention has been paid to the
significant and unique concerns that are experienced by
married women. Among married women, approximately
27% have reported an unintended pregnancy in the 2002
survey. Among married women, there has been little
improvement since 1995 when the unintended pregnancy
rate was 28%.1 Explanations as to why married women
have not made significant progress in the reduction of
unintended pregnancy are unclear.

marital dissolution had a higher probability of an
unintended pregnancy. Women reported that their
husbands were likely to concur with the unintended
designation of the pregnancy.
Discussion and conclusions This study utilised a
unique perspective to examine contextual factors related
to unintended pregnancy among married women. The
results support the need to focus on the couple as a unit
for prevention efforts. Social policies to enhance access to
family planning services are necessary to improve
outcomes and prevent unintended pregnancies.

Researchers at the Emory Center on Health Outcomes
and Quality9 reported that one-third of the unintended
pregnancies among the 1173 births examined in this study
occurred among married, educated and commercially insured
women. Only 40% of the women with unintended pregnancy
reported using contraception at the time of the study.
Goldsmith et al.10 also examined knowledge of emergency
contraception in a population-based sample of women in
Oregon. The majority (69.5%) of the sample included
married women. They noted that lack of knowledge about
emergency contraception was associated with unintended
pregnancy when controlled for marital status and age.
Theoretical model
While multiple factors have been studied in relation to
unintended pregnancy, they have been examined in
isolation and the knowledge base has been limited to teen
pregnancy, non-marital childbearing and other high-risk
populations. Limited research has been done among
married women and unintended pregnancy. Also, studies
had observed pregnancy intendedness by looking at limited
independent variables and were not theory driven. Those
that were theory based focused on models of behaviour
focus and on one dimension of health promotion, such as
knowledge, attitudes or skills. Few studies have used one
of the ecological models to explain or predict unintended
pregnancy among married women. Moreover, limited
research has been done to explore the influence of the
environment on unintended pregnancies.
Key message points
G Unintended pregnancy is a complex construct
associated with individual disparities as well as other
social and economic factors.
G The ecological model of health promotion provides a
holistic approach to unintended pregnancy but due to its
complexity not all levels of the model were predictive of
unintended pregnancy among married women.
G Policies that support the inclusion of the spouse in
family planning education need to be implemented in
order to enhance the couple's ability to manage their
reproductive health.

McLeroy and associates11 developed an ecological
model for health promotion that links health promotion
strategies that target individual behaviours and
environmental influences. The ecological model consists of
five levels of analysis related to health behaviours and
potential interventions.12 The intrapersonal level of the
ecological model includes an individual's knowledge,
attitudes, values, skills, behaviour, self-concept and beliefs.
The interpersonal level encompasses social networks, social
supports, families, peers and neighbours. The institutional
level includes rules regulations and informal structures that
may influence behaviour. The community level is comprised
of community resources, neighbourhood organisations, and
social and health services. The public policy level constitutes
relevant legislation, policies and regulatory agencies.
Unintended pregnancy in an ecological
perspective: background
Intrapersonal factors
Unintended pregnancies occur among women of all
socioeconomic levels and all marital statuses and age
groups. Women under the age of 20 or older than 40 years,
who are poor, with less than high school education and of
African American race are especially likely to become
pregnant unintentionally however.2,4,5 Poverty is strongly
related to greater difficulty in using reversible
contraceptive methods successfully; these women are also
the least likely to have the resources necessary to access
family planning services and the most likely to be affected
negatively by an unintended pregnancy.3 Data from the
2001 NSFG showed that low-income women had much
higher rates of unintended pregnancy than did wealthier
women and that the disparity had increased since 1994.2
This disparity might reflect health insurance coverage
disparities where poor women are twice as likely to have
no health insurance as compared to all women.13
Several studies that have explored how religious
affiliation affects contraceptive use revealed significant
differences in contraceptive use styles among Catholics,
Protestants, Jews and those of no religious affiliation.
Differences were hypothesised to be in relation to social
norms, differential sex roles, male­female communication
patterns, and the differential use of physician-based versus
other sources of contraceptives.14,15 Other studies found
little difference among Protestants, Catholics and Jews in
overall contraceptive prevalence. However, Protestants
relied more heavily on tubal sterilisation than on other
methods, while Catholics were more likely to use the pill
and Jews were more likely to use the diaphragm.16
The effect of childhood abuse and household
dysfunction on women's sexual behaviour continues from
adolescence to adulthood. Women who suffered frequent
psychological or physical abuse were significantly more
likely to have an unintended first pregnancy than those
women who did not.17
Interpersonal factors
Numerous studies support the notion that a woman's
partner may have a major impact on her use or non-use of
contraceptive method. Miller18 showed that, among
married women, dislike by the husband of a method being
used was significantly associated with an increased
incidence of subsequent non-use. Acceptability of the
mother's pregnancy intention was highly associated with
the partner's attitude towards the pregnancy.9,19,20
Institutional factors
Proper use of contraceptive technologies for fertility
regulation is linked to the availability of quality
contraceptive services providing a full range of safe,
approved methods of contraception. The literature reported
the risk of unintended pregnancies to be associated with the
failure of contraceptive methods, non-use of contraceptive
methods, and lack of knowledge about contraceptive
options,21 suggesting limited access to family planning
counselling and the influence of the cost of
contraceptives.4
Community factors
A multilevel analysis of marital and non-marital fertility
in the USA found that for married women the contextual
factors that affect the likelihood of a birth include the
extent of full-time female labour force participation, the
percentage of white-collar workers, and the percentage
of females in the community who are separated or
divorced. In contrast, the contextual variables that
affected out-of-wedlock birth included: female
unemployment rate; median housing value; percentage of
females separated or divorced; percentage of females at
childbearing age; sex ratio of the never married
population; and the child/woman ratio for women aged
15­24 years.22 Community characteristics associated
with higher levels of contraceptive effectiveness
included rapid population growth, high socioeconomic
status, and accessibility to family planning information
and services. Community liberality, as measured by
voting patterns, was negatively associated with effective
contraceptive use.23
Public policy
The political atmosphere surrounding the years
1980­1991 is reflected by policy decisions that were not
in favour of women who wanted to control their fertility
and space their births. Although it was a time of new
contraceptive developments and advances, they were not
available to most of the target population. The media
predominantly portrayed negative coverage by reporting
mainly the complications of various forms of
contraception. Funding was cut for family planning
services and the services themselves were restricted. In
the year 2000, the Department of Health and Human
Services announced increasing private sector insurance
coverage of contraceptives as an official public health
goal.24 Since then, considerable progress toward the goal
has been achieved; yet half of the women of reproductive
health live in states where there is no such mandate.
Moreover, the mandate relates to employees who are
covered through employers who purchase health
insurance and not to employees who work for employers
who self-insure.24 Health insurance continues to be a
barrier for women's reproductive health. A high
percentage of poor women have no health insurance. In
addition, federal spending under Title X declined between
1994 and 2001.13 [NB. Title X is the USA's federal
grant programme dedicated solely to providing
individuals with comprehensive family planning and
related preventive health services. The Title X programme
is designed to provide access to contraceptive services,
supplies and information to all who want and need them.
By law, priority is given to persons from low-income
families.25]
Given the dearth of research examining factors
associated with unintended pregnancy among married
women, the purpose of the present study was to examine
the contexts in which unintended pregnancy occurs in this
group. The proposed original model (Figure 1) based on
McLeroy et al.'s ecological model of health promotion
guided the study.11

Methods
The study design was a secondary data analysis of the fifth
cycle of the NSFG merged with contextual data available
through the CDC. This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the University of
Massachusetts Lowell and the CDC Research Data Center.
The NSFG is a population-based survey of women,
aged 15­44 years, from the civilian non-institutionalised
sector of the USA. The NSFG surveys women every 3 to 7
years on sexual activity, contraceptive use, family
planning, pregnancy intention, marriage and cohabitation,
and infertility.26 At the time of this analysis, data were not
yet available for the sixth (2002) and seventh (2006­2008)
data collection; thus this study analysed the 1995 NSFG
dataset. An analysis of the seventh cycle data is planned to
examine differences among the identified contextual
factors from 1995 to 2006. This study incorporated factors
from the first four levels of the socioecological model. The
fifth level, public policy (i.e. the sociopolitical context in
which the unintended pregnancies occurred) is described as
the background for this study.
Inclusion criteria for this study included women from
the USA who: were between the ages of 18 and 44 years at
the time of pregnancy conception; gave birth between the
years 1985 and 1995; and were married at the time of
conception. The contextual NSFG data were available for
the women's addresses during the calendar years 1990,
1993 and 1995. To satisfy the match between the timing of
pregnancy conception with the timing of the contextual
data collected and the women's address at the time the
pregnancy occurred, individual level data were merged
with the 1990 address and then matched to the NSFG 1995
contextual data. The sample was limited to include
pregnancies that were conceived between the years 1985
and 1995. The sample for this study included 5936
pregnancies among 3384 married women.
Definitions of pregnancy intention vary. Often the terms
`unplanned pregnancy' and `unintended pregnancy' are used
interchangeably. For the purpose of the study, a recoded
variable created by the NSFG data analysers was adopted.
The dependent variable, intendedness of pregnancy, was
defined as a dichotomous variable classified as unintended
or intended pregnancy at the time of conception. To
operationalise this concept, in the survey each woman was
asked to think back to the time when she became pregnant.
If a woman responded that, at the time she became pregnant,
she did not want any more children, that pregnancy was
classified as unwanted. If the woman reported instead that
she did want a child in the future, she was asked whether that
pregnancy occurred too soon, too late or at about the right
time. Pregnancies that occurred too soon or were unwanted
are classified as unintended, while those that occurred at
about the right time or too late are considered intended.5
The independent variables included seven
intrapersonal indicators: age at conception, parity,
race/ethnicity, education, religious affiliation, exposure to
sexual violence and poverty level income. Two main
interpersonal variables included were family background
and husband's demographic factors such as race, education,
religious affiliation, and pregnancy intendedness. Family
background included both the woman's father's education
and intact status of her childhood family. The husband's
pregnancy intendedness was based on the woman's
recollection of her husband's pregnancy intendedness.
The availability of family planning services within the
county of residence was chosen as an institutional level
variable from the NSFG contextual data set. Another
indicator for the presence of institutions in the community
was the number of abortions per 10 000 women between
the ages of 15 and 44 years. Predictive community level
factors were divided into general categories: place of
residence and community marital status at the county level.
The place of residence was classified into: central cities of
metropolitan areas, suburban areas and non-metropolitan
areas. Community marital status was measured by the
proportion of women who were separated or divorced.

Statistics
The data were analysed using SAS version 8.12 (SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). As a preparation for the
multivariate analysis, several statistical procedures such as
the Chi square test, correlation tests and the Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel statistical test were used to assess
bivariate associations between the dependent variable
(unintended pregnancy) and the variables chosen to
represent the different levels of the ecological model. The
contextual county level variables were selected after
extensive preliminary analysis and based on the literature.
Several aggregate level variables were correlated with each
other so that some of these variables could not enter into
the same statistical model at once. This happened
especially when the researchers introduced contextual
variables that could stand as a proxy for socioeconomic
indicators such as female unemployment rate and
community education status. Since multicollinearity may
lead to unstable estimates with large sample errors, only
one representative variable per theoretical model level was
introduced during the process of multilevel modelling
(Appendix 1 shows the results from the bivariate analysis.)
For multivariate analyses, SAS PROC NLMIXED27
procedure was used to estimate the effects of the
dimensions of individual and community characteristics on
unintended pregnancies among married women. Two levels
of data aggregation ­ individual and county level ­were
included in analysis. Because individuals are nested within
regional contexts (counties used for this analysis), a
multilevel model was a preferable choice. These models
may be more realistic than models assuming that county
characteristics have either no effect, or a constant effect on
the probability of having an unintended pregnancy.20
In this analysis, all regression coefficients other than
the intercept are constrained to be fixed across the county
units based on the assumption that the effect of the
explanatory variables does not differ between counties. A
two-step analysis approach advocated by Raudenbuch and
Bryk28 was used. In a first stage of model building, models
with only individual effects were estimated. Consequently
in the second stage, models with both individual and
county variables were estimated due to the fact that several
contextual level variables were correlated with each other.
Results
Table 1 describes selected characteristics of women in this
study. The table represents the weighted percentages that
adjust for different sampling rates, response rates and
coverage rates so that accurate national estimates can be
made from the sample. The mothers were mainly of non-
Hispanic white origin (65%). Ninety-eight percent were
married at the time of giving birth. Seventy-six percent of
the pregnancies were intended. This is comparable to the
percentage of unintended pregnancies described by
Henshaw.29
A significant association between pregnancy
intendedness and place of residence while controlling for
poverty level income was noted (p<0.0001) (Figure 2).
Women living in central cities with a lower income had a
higher percentage of unintended pregnancies compared to
women residing in the suburban and non-
metropolitan/rural areas belonging to a lower
socioeconomic status. In addition, there was a significant
association between the proportion of women separated or
divorced in the community and unintended pregnancy
while poverty level income was controlled for (p<0.0001).
Women living in communities with a higher divorce rate
and a lower socioeconomic level had the highest
percentage (37.18%) of unintended pregnancies (Figure 3).
Table 2 summarises the results from the multivariate
analysis. The first model shows variability across counties
for pregnancy intendedness and therefore justifies the
application of this statistical method (Table 2, Model 1). In
the second model (Table 2, Model 2) the researchers
introduced the intrapersonal and interpersonal level
variables. The coefficients exhibited the predicted pattern
consistent with the literature. Non-Hispanic white women
of higher socioeconomic level and lower parity had a lower
probability of an unintended pregnancy. The intact status of
the childhood family and the experience of forced sex was
a significant predictor as well but only in this model. Age
at conception was not significant. This pattern followed
throughout the models.
The third model (Table 2, Model 3) introduced the
husbands' characteristics such as race, religion, education
and pregnancy intention in addition to the community level
variable, the place of residence. Both were individual level
variables. The husband's race and perceived pregnancy
intendedness showed a significant association with the
probability of unintended pregnancy. As with the women, a
non-Hispanic white husband had a lower probability of
unintended pregnancy. The husband's positive pregnancy
intendedness is significantly associated with the woman's
positive pregnancy intendedness. The final model, Model 4

introduced contextual variables from the institutional
theoretical model level that showed significance at the
bivariate analysis. The variables `family planning per
101000 women in need' and the `abortions per 10 000
women between 15 and 44 years' showed no significant
association but improved the model fit (lowered the log
likelihood). The `proportion of women separated or
divorced' was included for the community level theoretical
model level. The community marital status was
significantly related to pregnancy intendedness (p<0.05).
Discussion
This study offers a unique contextual approach to examine
the relationship between several layers of a theoretical
model using multilevel logistic regression. Overall,
married women of lower socioeconomic status, higher
parity, whose husband did not intend the pregnancy or who
were living in a community of marital instability had a
higher probability of an unintended pregnancy.
The only marginally significant contextual variable in
the model that increased the probability of unintended
pregnancy was the proportion of women in the community
who were separated or divorced. Previous research has
found that a married woman was less likely to have a child
when she lived in a community where there was a high rate
of separated and divorced families.22 The results of this
study also suggested that the higher the rate of abortions in
the community, the lower the probability of unintended
pregnancy. The higher the rate of family planning services
per 10 000 women in need, the lower was the probability of
unintended pregnancy. Grady et al.23 found that community
family planning clinics promote effective contraception
among married women. Similarly, Foster et al.30 concluded
that family planning services in low-income families in
California are essential to provide the necessary education
and access to address long-terms needs related to pregnancy
prevention. However, a recent review of the quality of
family planning services concluded that the service quality
may vary significantly across sites.31
One explanation for the reason why community
characteristics were not significant in the multivariate
models could be the correlation between unobserved
individual characteristics and community factors.32 Those
intrapersonal and interpersonal factors may enhance
married women's vulnerability for a higher risk of
unintended pregnancy, particularly when they are also
exposed to unfavourable community and public policy
factors.33 Previous research looking at the impact of
community characteristics on a variety of outcomes
(marital dissolution, fertility decisions, youth sexual
activity) did not find direct causal influence of
neighbourhood characteristics on the studied outcomes as
well.34,35

Husbands' perceived pregnancy intendedness was
another significant finding in this analysis, confirming
previous research that suggested that acceptability of the
mother's pregnancy intention was highly associated with
the partner's attitude towards the pregnancy.18,19 Special
efforts must be made to strengthen family planning
services to include men in counselling and to build positive
male attitudes toward reproductive health.30

Unintended pregnancy among married women

The analysis revealed that the higher the woman's
education level, the lower the risk of unintended
pregnancy. Previous studies have shown a similar
association between education and unintended
pregnancy.2,4,36,37 Education raises the opportunity for
career development and earning opportunities that are
likely to compete with domestic and childrearing
responsibilities.38 Since parity and race are related to
socioeconomic status, women with a lower poverty level
income had a higher parity and they are more likely to be
non-white. These results support findings from previous
research indicating that women who were black and
reported a lower socioeconomic status had a higher odds of
having an unintended pregnancy compared with those of
white women of higher socioeconomic level.4,36,37
Of interest was the finding that Catholic women were not
significantly more likely to have an unintended pregnancy
compared with Protestant women. Earlier studies have
hypothesised differences among religious groups to be
related to social norms, differential sex roles, male­female
communication patterns, and the differential use of
physician-based versus other sources of contraceptives.1,14,15
Intact status of childhood family and past history of
forced first sex showed significant association only at the
second statistical model (Table 2, Model 2). As the model
became more complex, other variables appeared to be
stronger predictors (husband pregnancy intendedness, for
example).
In terms of the policy context, not much had changed in
relative to policies that impacted women and their partners
who are seeking to control their fertility from the time data
were collected for this survey to a more recent time period.
Indeed, recent published data related to the 1994­2001
time period concluded that there is almost no change in the
overall rate of unintended pregnancies with a slight rise for
married women compared with the NSFG data from 1995.
Health insurance coverage rate during the compared years
stayed at an average of 15% for the overall population,
indicating persisting barriers to access to contraception and
services.39 Funding for family planning services for the
low-income population was cut and the services
themselves were restricted. Based on the described
similarities, the same analysis using the seventh cycle of
the NSFG data should not be dramatically different from
these findings; however, comparative analyses are planned
using the 2006­2007 NSFG data expected to be released in
2010.
Several limitations were identified in this study. Given
their holistic perspective, ecological models are very
complex. Due to the complexity of the model and the large
number of independent variables involved, several of the
predictor variables may not be significant in the prediction
of unintended pregnancy among married women due to the
multifaceted relation between the dependent variable and
the independent variables and between the independent
variables themselves. Another limitation of this study is the
potential differences in cultural interpretation7,40 of the
construct of pregnancy intention. Asking women to recall
pregnancy `intention' or `wantedness' from the past could
also lead to recall bias. However, previous research has
shown that women can accurately recall pregnancy
information after an extended period of time.41,42
Despite these limitations, this study utilised a unique
approach to examine the contextual factors associated with
pregnancy intendedness. Clinical implications include the
need for practitioners to identify those women at risk for
unintended pregnancies with considerations of community
contextual factors in addition to personal risk factors. Also
the findings suggest that participation of husbands and
partners in reproductive education, decision making and
family planning services should be increased. Special
efforts must be made to strengthen family planning
services to include men.
Future research in the planning stages includes a
comparative analysis of the NSFG seventh data cycle
(2006­2008) using an ecological approach. In addition, the
construct of pregnancy intention needs to be further refined
to determine racial/ethnic and other cultural interpretations.
It is recommended that the social ecological model will be
utilised to examine the contextual factors among married
and unmarried women as well. Future population-based
studies should also include data from the women's partners
to enhance interventions. This study has identified factors to
support and enhance changes in practice with the aim of
reducing unintended pregnancies in the USA. As the health
policy debate continues in the national arena, researchers,
clinicians and policymakers need to come together to ensure
coverage for preventative services such as family planning.
