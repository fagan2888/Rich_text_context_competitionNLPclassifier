Subclinical Hypothyroidism
and the Risk of Hypercholesterolemia
ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as a mild elevation in thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in patients with normal serum thyroxine levels,
has been associated with elevationed levels in serum cholesterol in some sample
populations. These studies, however, have included referred patients and large
numbers of patients with previously treated hyperthyroidism. The aim of this
study was to assess whether subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with abnor-
mal lipid levels in a population-based sample.
METHODS Data from adults older than 40 years who did not previously have a
diagnosis of hypothyroidism or who were taking thyroid replacement medica-
tion were analyzed from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey
(NHANES) III. Subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as a TSH value of 6.7 to
14.9 mU/L and normal thyroxine (n = 215). Euthyroid control adults included par-
ticipants with a TSH in a normal range between 0.36 and 6.7 mU/L (n = 8,013).
Outcomes examined were serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in those who had sub-
clinical hypothyroidism and in euthyroid controls.
RESULTS Persons meeting the criteria for subclinical hypothyroidism had higher
mean cholesterol levels (226 vs 217 mg/dL, P = .003) and rates of elevated
cholesterol levels (74.2% vs 63.9%, P = 0.02) than the euthyroid control group,
but there were no significant differences in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. When adjusted for age, race, sex, and the use
of lipid-lowering drugs, however, subclinical hypothyroidism was not related to
elevations in cholesterol levels (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.06, 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.57­1.97), LDL levels (adjusted OR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.59­1.35),
or triglyceride levels (adjusted OR = 1.83; 95% CI, 0.87­3.85) or to a low HDL
level (adjusted OR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.36­2.48).
CONCLUSIONS Subclinical hypothyroidism does not appear to be associated with
abnormalities in serum cholesterol or triglyceride levels when adjusted for con-
founding variables in this population-based study.

INTRODUCTION
Subclinical hypothyroidism, also called mild hypothyroidism, is a term
used for a condition in which there are small elevations in thyroid-stimu-
lating hormone, yet normal circulating levels of thyroid hormones. This
condition is more common in the elderly and is found twice as often in women
as in men.1,2 While it is uncommon in younger persons, by the age of 65 years,
the overall prevalence of the disorder is about 17% in women and 7% in men.3
Despite recognition of this condition and the observation that a small
percentage of these patients advance to overt hypothyroidism each year, con-
troversy continues over whether elderly individuals should be screened for
subclinical hypothyroidism.4-6 Whereas the American Thyroid Association7 has
endorsed screening for this disorder, others, such as the US Preventive Services

SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM AND HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA
Task Force,8 have advised against routine screening. In
addition, although the American College of Physicians
recognizes that screening women older than 50 years for
hypothyroidism may have some value, they specifically
note that the benefit of treating patients with subclinical
hypothyroidism has not been evaluated.9
The decision about whether to screen patients for this
disorder is clouded by inconsistent evidence of any benefit
from early treatment. A few trials have found that persons
with subclinical hypothyroidism who are given L-thyrox-
ine experience some improvements in their energy level
and feelings of well-being.10-12 These studies, however,
have had few participants, enrolled patients with preexist-
ing thyroid disease resulting from thyroid ablation, and
included patients referred to specialists rather than the
general population. It is not clear that these results can be
generalized to individuals who would be identified solely
through mass-screening efforts.
Another finding that has been used to argue for
screening and treatment of subclinical hypothyroid-
ism is the observation that thyroid replacement in
patients with subclinical hypothyroidism can reduce
abnormalities in cholesterol.3,4,13 Lipid abnormalities
are reported to be more common in patients with overt
hypothyroidism and are thought to contribute to the
disproportionate increase in cardiovascular risk in these
persons.14 Some studies of patients with subclinical
hypothyroidism also have shown that patients have
elevations in their cholesterol levels.15-17 There are few
population-based studies that have compared lipid
levels in patients who have subclinical hypothyroidism
with lipid levels in euthyroid persons. The purpose of
this study was to determine whether lipid abnormalities
are more common in patients with subclinical hypothy-
roidism when compared lipid levels in euthyroid indi-
viduals using data from the Third National Health and
Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES III).
METHODS
NHANES III (1988-1994), which is a cross-sectional
study of a nationally representative sample of nonin-
stitutionalized US residents, was used for this study.
The NHANES III is a federally sponsored survey that
includes a detailed health interview, physical exami-
nation, and laboratory testing. To assure a sufficient
number of minority participants for meaningful analy-
ses, the NHANES III oversamples minority groups.
When the data are adjusted for this oversampling using
weighting factors, the results are designed to represent
a population estimate for the entire US population.
From the NHANES III data set, the adult question-
naire, physical examination, and laboratory sections
were merged using the unique sequence number for
each respondent. The total number of respondents
with reported thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and
thyroxine (T4
) values was 15,851. Because subclinical
hypothyroidism is uncommon in younger persons, and
the treatment of cholesterol abnormalities is less well
defined in younger age-groups, we focused our analysis
on persons 40 years of age and older. This approach
produced a sample size of 8,586 (Figure 1). From this
group, we attempted to exclude all respondents with
known hypothyroidism by excluding respondents who
were taking any medication that was prescribed for
a diagnosis of primary or secondary hypothyroidism
(ICD-9-CM codes 244.8 and 244.9), resulting in a final
sample size of 8,228.
We defined the subclinical hypothyroidism group as
those with a TSH range of 6.70 to 14.99 mU/L and a
T4
value greater than 4.5 µg/dL. The euthyroid control
group was classified as those with normal TSH values
between 0.36 mU/L and 6.70 mU/L.
Outcome measures were total cholesterol, high-den-
sity lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL),
and triglyceride levels. We looked at these measures as
continuous variables and stratified each into bivariate
categories representing high and low values. Respondents
were considered to have a high total cholesterol level if
the serum value was greater than 200 mg/dL. Low HDL
was defined as less than 35 mg/dL. Elevation of LDL was
defined as greater than 130 mg/dL, while an elevation in
triglycerides was defined as a value higher than 250 mg/dL.
These values were selected based on the recommendations

SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM AND HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA
of the National Institutes of Health Adult Treatment
Panel III8 report, which was the prevailing recom-
mendations when data for the NHANES III were
collected.
All analyses were performed using SUDAAN
software (SUDAAN, Research Triangle Park,
Cary, NC) to account for the complex sampling
design of the NHANES III. SUDAAN allows for
population estimates to be calculated despite the
complex sampling design of the NHANES. For
these 2 groups, we computed descriptive statistics
and made bivariate comparisons using chi-square
analysis and Student's t test. Logistic regression
models were used to control for age, sex, and race.
RESULTS
Of the 8,228 respondents included in the study,
215 (2.6%) were found to fit the criteria for sub-
clinical hypothyroidism. The characteristics of
the persons with subclinical hypothyroidism and
euthyroid control group are displayed in Table 1.
We found that subclinical hypothyroidism was
more common in women and in non-Hispanic
whites and with increased age.
When we looked at serum lipid values for
the entire group, we found that persons with
subclinical hypothyroidism were more likely to
have elevations in their average cholesterol and
triglyceride levels (Table 2). When we dichoto-
mized these variables into high or low based on
national guidelines, we found that persons with
subclinical hypothyroidism were more likely to
have elevated total cholesterol levels. No statis-
tically significant differences between persons
with subclinical hypothyroidism and euthyroid
controls were found in the percentage of respon-
dents with abnormal HDL levels, LDL levels, or
in triglyceride levels (Table 3).
Because treatment of elevated cholesterol lev-
els with medications is common, we considered
the possibility that preexisting elevations in lipid
levels in the subclinical hypothyroid respondents
might have been reduced as a result of use of
lipid-lowering drugs. To explore this possibil-
ity, we looked at whether respondents in each
group were taking cholesterol-lowering agents.
We found that a greater percentage of respon-
dents in the euthyroid control group (77.3%)
were taking cholesterol-lowering agents than
were respondents in the subclinical hypothyroid
group (65.7%, P = .0004). Consequently, it
was unlikely that the use of cholesterol-lower-
ing therapy reduced the baseline lipid levels in

SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM AND HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA
subclinical hypothyroid respondents so that true dif-
ferences were obscured. If anything, it was more likely
that the euthyroid control group had higher baseline
cholesterol and LDL values.
To examine whether other possible covariates could
mask differences between the groups, we performed a
logistic regression analysis using subclinical hypothy-
roidism and adjusting for any effects of sex, age, race,
and the use of cholesterol-lowering medications on the
risk of having an elevated total or LDL cholesterol lev-
els. The analysis showed no effect of subclinical hypo-
thyroidism on the frequency of abnormalities in total
cholesterol, LDL, HDL, or triglycerides (Table 4).
The logistic regression analysis simply explored
normal or abnormal lipid levels. Although there are
recommended cutoffs for lipid abnormalities, the cardio-
vascular risk related to cholesterol abnormalities is linear
in nature. To examine whether subclinical hypothyroid-
ism is related to cholesterol values throughout the range
of cholesterol, we performed a second analysis using
linear regression and the same covariates noted above.
Again, there was no statistically significant relationship
between subclinical hypothyroidism and total choles-
terol level (P = 85), LDL level (P = .34), HDL (P = .88),
or triglyceride level (P = .29).
DISCUSSION
In this population-based sample, compared with
respondents who had normal TSH levels, respondents
with mild elevations in their serum TSH and normal T4
levels were more likely to have elevations in cholesterol
levels. After adjusting for demographic and other clini-
cal variables, however, no significant relationship was
found between cholesterol, HDL, or LDL levels and
subclinical hypothyroidism. The only relationship that
was significant after adjusting for potential confounding
variables was an increase in the number of persons with
high triglyceride levels and lower HDL levels in the
subclinical hypothyroid group.
Hypercholesterolemia was common in both the
subclinical hypothyroid group and the euthyroid con-
trol group. Nearly two thirds of this sample were tak-
ing cholesterol-lowering agents, which might account
for the fairly good lipid levels observed in these
respondents. The frequent use of cholesterol-lowering
agents is common in this age-group, however. Another
population-based study reported that in persons older
than 65 years, 63% of participants were found to have
a cholesterol level higher than 200 mg/dL.19 Previous
reports showing hypercholesterolemia to be com-
mon in persons with subclinical hypothyroidism may
simply reflect that hypercholesterolemia is a common
condition. This possibility is underscored by a recent
report showing that while LDL levels were higher in
overt hypothyroidism, there were no differences found
between subclinical hypothyroid respondents and
matched euthyroid controls.15
Our examination of thyroid function in NHANES
III participants is similar to that of Hollowell et al,20 but
there are several important differences. In their study,
Hollowell and colleagues found that 4.3% of all per-
sons had subclinical hypothyroidism. These research-
ers, however, did not exclude patients who had known
hypothyroidism and were taking thyroid replacement
medications, which constituted about 13% of their
subclinical hypothyroidism group. Also, the cutoff
value for a high TSH level in the Hollowell et al study
was set at 4.5 mU/L, a value lower than the value used
in our study. Although the inclusion of patients with
a TSH level between 4.5 and 6.7 mU/L increases the
prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism, these patients
are least likely to have any clinical symptoms of hypo-
thyroidism and have a lower risk of future progression
compared with those who have higher TSH levels. Fur-
thermore, there is no a priori reason why patients with
TSH levels between 4.5 and 6.7 mU/L would have lipid
levels that differ from those of patients with higher TSH
levels, so the exclusion of these individuals should not
alter our overall conclusions.
These findings have implications for recommenda-
tions on screening for subclinical hypothyroidism.
Although one study has examined the cost utility of
screening for subclinical hypothyroidism and found
screening to be cost-effective, that study included the
identification and treatment of lipid abnormalities as
a benefit of screening.21 From these results, it would
appear that screening for subclinical hypothyroidism
simply to identify lipid abnormalities would be no more
useful than screening for hyperlipidemia in general.
Nor is there any evidence that treatment of hyperlipid-
emia in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism would
be any different from treatment of hyperlipidemia in
euthyroid patients. Consequently, analyses of the cost-
effectiveness of subclinical hypothyroidism screening

SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM AND HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA
that include a benefit from the treatment of lipid abnor-
malities may overestimate the value of screening.
The findings of this study must be interpreted
within the limitations of the study design. In particular,
the ability to determine whether treatment of previ-
ously elevated cholesterol levels is limited by the lack
of information about current treatment regimens and
how long the problem had been known to the patient.
Thus, patients who had known about their cholesterol
abnormalities for a few days were grouped in the same
category as those who had been under treatment for
several years. Although the effectiveness of therapy
may be underestimated in this population, it is unlikely
that the distribution in the time that patients knew
about their hyperlipidemic condition or treatments
would vary between the 2 groups.
Second, our assumption that the subclinical hypothy-
roid group is homogeneous might ignore the possibility
that a subgroup of these persons might be at greater
risk for hyperlipidemia. For example, patients with TSH
values between 10 and 15 mU/L have been found to be
at greater risk of advancing to overt hypothyroidism dur-
ing the next few years. It is possible that this group or
another subset also could be at higher risk for hypercho-
lesterolemia or other sequelae related to overt hypothy-
roidism before the thyroid completely fails.
In addition, because of the cross-sectional nature
of this analysis, it is difficult to ascribe causality to any
associations we have found. Because we do not know
whether thyroid test abnormalities preceded elevations
in triglyceride levels, it cannot be definitely stated that
one leads to the other. Further evaluation of this rela-
tionship with longitudinal data would be necessary to
support a causal link.
Last, it is important to emphasize that this analysis
focused solely on the benefits of finding subclinical
hypothyroidism for the purposes of treating hyper-
lipidemias. Other beneficial effects of treatment, such
as improvements in well-being, might be of sufficient
value to patients to warrant screening.21 Further evalu-
ation of patients from population-based screening
programs who are found to have subclinical hypothy-
roidism rather than those referred for specialty manage-
ment would be useful in determining the magnitude of
these benefits in the general population.
