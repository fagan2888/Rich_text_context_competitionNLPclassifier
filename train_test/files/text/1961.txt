SINCE the discovery of cortisol receptors in the brain
(McEwen, Weiss, & Schwartz, 1968), researchers have
been interested in understanding how cortisol is associated
with cognitive function (CF). Although much of the re-
search examining links between cortisol and CF has relied
on the experimental manipulation of cortisol levels (Lupien &
McEwen, 1997; Lupien et al., 2005), considerable efforts
have been devoted to examining links between naturally
occurring cortisol levels and CF (e.g., Seeman, McEwen,
Singer, Albert, & Rowe, 1997). The diurnal rhythm of cor-
tisol is garnering considerable empirical attention for its
utility as an indicator of not only stress but also general
neuroendocrine function and its potential links to physical,
emotional, and cognitive health (Adam & Kumari, 2009).
The current study was conducted to examine associations
between CF and the dynamics of daily cortisol across the
adult life span in a national sample of adults.
Cortisol is a hormone secreted by the hypothalamic­
pituitary­adrenal (HPA) axis. It is released in response to
stress (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004) but is more than just a
product of the stress response and is a widely used indicator
of general neuroendocrine/HPA axis health (Hellhammer
et al., 2007; Miller, Chen, & Zhou, 2007). Cortisol exhibits
a diurnal pattern, reaching its peak within an hour after
waking and declining thereafter, until reaching a nadir at
approximately midnight (Kirschbaum & Hellhammer,
1989; Pruessner et al., 1997). The initial rise referred to as
the morning rise (MR) and the decline thereafter as the
diurnal cortisol slope (DCS; Adam & Kumari, 2009; Cohen
et al., 2006). Robust MR and DCS slopes are thought to reflect
a healthy HPA axis function and flattened profiles being
unhealthy (Adam & Kumari, 2009; Stone et al., 2001).
Additional evidence for patterns of healthy HPA axis
function comes from a recent meta-analysis by Miller and
colleagues (2007) considering associations between chronic
stress and HPA axis dysregulation. The authors found that
chronic stress-related HPA dysregulation manifests as a
flatter MR and DCS and higher overall total cortisol output.
Such dysregulation is also evidenced in lower morning
cortisol levels and higher afternoon/evening levels. These
convergent patterns suggest that there are certain charac-
teristics of diurnal cortisol indicative of healthy HPA axis
function (i.e., steeper MR and DCS, higher morning lev-
els, and lower afternoon/evening levels), which can inform
hypotheses associations between cortisol and other con-
structs of theoretical interest.
CF is one construct that has been linked to cortisol and
received considerable empirical attention. Cortisol is thought
to have proximal effects on CF by interfering with neural
transmission and subsequent behavioral performance
(Lupien&Lapage,2001;Wolf,2003;however,seeRoozendaal,
2002) and more durable and distal effects via neuronal
death from prolonged exposure to cortisol (Sapolsky, 1992).

Objectives. We examined associations between cognitive function (CF) and the naturally occurring daily cortisol
levels using data from the Midlife in the United States survey and the National Study of Daily Experiences.
Methods. A national sample of 1,500 (mean age = 57 years; range = 33­84, 56% female) completed a phone-based
battery of cognitive tasks and 3­6 months later provided saliva samples upon waking, 30 min after waking, at lunch time,
and at bedtime on 4 consecutive days.
Results. Higher CF, particularly executive function, was associated with healthier daily cortisol profiles, including a
steeper diurnal cortisol slope, higher morning cortisol levels, and lower afternoon and evening cortisol levels.
Discussion. The results indicate that better CF is associated with healthier profiles of naturally occurring cortisol and
underscore the importance of the timing of cortisol sampling.

and frontal lobes have led researchers examining cognition­
cortisol links to focus on tasks measuring episodic memory
(EM), which is governed by the hippocampus (Squire,
1992), and executive function (EF), which is governed by
the frontal lobes (Stuss & Knight, 2002). Although the
majority of research linking cortisol to CF has used experi-
mentation to examine how acute changes in cortisol are
associated with CF (see Lupien & Lapage, 2001; Lupien &
McEwen, 1997 for reviews), there is a growing body of
work examining how naturally occurring cortisol levels and
rhythms are associated with CF.
Flatter DCS slopes have been associated with poorer EM
among older adults experiencing memory deficits and
depressive symptoms (Fiocco, Wan, Weekes, Pim, & Lupien,
2006), older adults positive for theAPOE-e4 allele, a known
risk factor for dementia (Gerritsen, Comijs, Deeg, Penninx, &
Geerlings, in press), and poorer EF among community-
dwelling older adults (Beluche, Carrière, Ritchie, & Ancelin,
2009). For morning cortisol levels, Lupien and colleagues
have shown that annual increases in 24-hr average basal
cortisol levels are associated with poorer EM (Lupien et al.,
1994) and smaller hippocampal volume (Lupien et al.,
1998) among older adults. Similarly, Kuningas and col-
leagues (2007) found that higher morning cortisol levels
were associated with poorer global CF, attention, and
processing speed in older adults aged 85 years and older,
whereas Beluche and colleagues (2009) found that higher
morning cortisol levels were associated with poorer EF and
EM in a community-dwelling sample of older adults. In
contrast, Gerritsen and colleagues (in press) found that
higher waking cortisol levels were associated with poorer
EM performance but only among older adults carrying the
APOE-e4, whereas Kalmijn and colleagues (1998) found
no reliable association between morning cortisol levels and
an index of global CF. Finally, regarding afternoon/evening
cortisol levels, Carlson and Sherwin (1999) observed that
older adults with higher afternoon levels of cortisol exhib-
ited poorer EM performance, whereas 12-hr overnight basal
cortisol levels of Seeman and colleagues (1997) were as-
sociated with poorer EM at baseline and greater declines
in EM over a 2.5-year period among women. Similarly,
Gerritsen and colleagues (in press) found that higher corti-
sol levels in the evening, just before bed, were associated
with poorer EM performance among older adults possess-
ing the APOE-e4 allele.
Research examining associations between the DCS,
afternoon/evening cortisol levels, and CF seems to be rather
consistent showing that a flatter DCS and higher levels of
afternoon evening cortisol are associated with poorer CF.
Findings regarding morning cortisol are mixed, possibly
due to the timing of the cortisol assessments. Basal levels
reported by Lupien were the average of samples taken over
a 24-hr period reflecting average cortisol output over a
given time period that includes morning levels. Second,
Kuningas and Beluche observed that higher levels of cortisol
were associated with poorer CF, but Kuningas' morning
sample was taken before 11 a.m. and Beluche's was taken at
least 1 hr after waking. Thus, in both studies, the samples
were possibly taken after the cortisol levels were likely
already starting to decline. Positive associations between
CF and morning cortisol levels might be expected proximal
to waking when cortisol levels are expected to be higher and
increasing, whereas negative associations might be expected
once levels have started to decline.
Previous research on cortisol and CF has also largely fo-
cused on levels and dynamics of cortisol being important for
predicting decrements in CF, implying a particular direction
of effect. More recently, researchers have considered that
cortsiol and CF may have a more dynamic relationship.
Existing models of HPA axis function support this notion.
Although cortisol is released from the adrenals and binds to
receptors in the hippocampus and frontal lobes, both these
brain regions also provide feedback to the hypothalamus as
part of HPA axis downregulation (Lupien & Lapage, 2001).
Empirical support for such bidirectional associations also ex-
ists. Lupien and colleagues (2005) showed that evidence of
childrens' CF, with respect to making emotional attributions,
significantly predicted morning basal cortisol levels. Using
prospective longitudinal data, Power, Li, and Hertzman
(2008) showed that lower childhood CF was predictive of a
flatter DCS forty-five years later during adulthood. Further-
more, Applehans and Luecken (2006) found that EF was
associated with diminished cortisol reactivity to threat cues.
Recent theoretical development regarding CF as an im-
portant predictor of health complements these empirical
findings. Williams, Suchy, and Rau (2009) have reviewed
evidence linking individual differences in CF, particularly
EF, to better self-regulation, suggesting that EF is a
potentially important characteristic for understanding
differential exposure, reactivity, and recovery from stress.
Similarly, Gottfredson and Deary (2004) have suggested
that CF, particularly intellectual abilities related to EF,
may be associated with better health and longevity be-
cause of increased skills useful in adaptation and prevent-
ing chronic disease. Here, CF may be beneficial for
adapting to stressful situations and tempering immediate
and prolonged reactions, and this may be reflected in
healthier naturally occurring cortisol profiles. Together,
this evidence supports potential bidirectional links be-
tween CF and cortisol, however, evidence for such asso-
ciations during adulthood and old age, and considering
both EF and EM remains scant.
The current study
The current study was conducted to examine associations
between CF and naturally occurring cortisol levels obtained
3­6 months later using a national sample of adults ranging
from 33 to 84 years of age. First, we examined associations
between CF and both the MR and the DCS as well as cortisol
levels at each of four specific sampling occasions (upon
CORTISOL AND COGNITION i73
waking, 30-min postwaking, before lunch, and before bed).
Second, given the links between cortisol and the frontal
lobes and hippocampus, we examined whether EF and EM
function were each uniquely related to naturally occurring
daily cortisol. Consistent with previous literature, we hy-
pothesized that higher CF would be associated with MR
and DCSs. Similarly, higher CF would be associated with
higher cortisol levels upon waking and 30-min postwaking
but lower levels before lunch and bed. Finally, given links
between cortisol receptors in both the frontal lobes and the
hippocampus, we expected EF and EM function to both
exhibit unique associations with cortisol.
Methods
Participants
The Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) II survey is com-
prised of 4,975 respondents (age range = 33­84 years). Of
those participants, 4,445 completed the telephone cognition
assessment and 2,022 completed the 8-day National Study of
Daily Experiences (NSDE; 1,736 participants in the NSDE
provided cortisol assessments). A total of 1,500 participants in
MIDUS completed both the telephone cognition assessment
and the NSDE cortisol sampling protocol and serve as the sam-
ple for the current study. The mean age of the sample was 57
years (SD = 12, range = 33­84), and 56% of the respondents
were female. The participants were fairly well educated, with
30% having received a high school diploma or less, 51%
having completed some college coursework or obtaining a
bachelor's degree, and 19% having pursued education beyond
a bachelor's degree. The current sample is slightly older, more
educated, in better health, and had higher CF scores (ps < .05)
than the full parent sample; however, these differences were of
extremely small effect size (R2s < 1%).
Procedure
Participants first completed the telephone cognitive as-
sessment, and approximately three to six months later, they
were enrolled in the NSDE. Once enrolled in the NSDE,
they completed short telephone interviews about their daily
experiences and emotions. The interviews lasted approxi-
mately 20 min and were conducted on eight consecutive
evenings. Participants also provided four salivary cortisol
samples on Days 2­5 of the study. Data collection for the
8-day interview protocol consisted of separate "flights" of
30 participants, with the start day of the interviews being
staggered across the day of the week to control for the pos-
sible confounding between day of study and day of week.
Participants received $45 for completing the study protocol.
Assessment of Salivary Cortisol
Respondents received a Home Saliva Collection Kit one
week prior to their initial phone call. Saliva was obtained

Before bed 3.67 4.34 10:30 p.m. 82 min
using salivette collection devices (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht,
Germany). Sixteen numbered and color-coded salivettes
and instructions were included in the collection kit. In addi-
tion to written instructions, telephone interviewers reviewed
the procedures and answered any of the participant's ques-
tions. On Days 2 through 5, respondents provided four
saliva samples per day that were later assayed for cortisol.
Saliva was collected immediately upon waking, 30 min
after waking, before lunch, and at before bed (Table 1).
Data on the exact time respondents provided each saliva
sample were obtained from the nightly telephone interviews
as well as on a paper­pencil log sent with the collection kit.
In addition, approximately 25% of the respondents (N =
430) received a "smart box" containing a computer chip that
recorded the time respondents opened and closed the box.
Correlations between self-reported times across collection
occasions were all above .9. Correlations between self-
reported times and times obtained from the "smart box"
ranged from .75 for the evening occasion to .95 for the
morning occasion.
Upon completion of the saliva sampling procedure, the
salivettes were shipped to the MIDUS Biological Core
at the University of Wisconsin, where they were stored at
-60 °C. For analysis, salivettes were thawed and centri-
fuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, yielding a clear fluid with low
viscosity. Cortisol concentrations were quantified with a
commercially available luminescence immunoassay (IBL,
Hamburg, Germany), with intra-assay and interassay co-
efficient of variations below 5% (Dressendörfer, Kirsch-
baum, Rohde, Stahl, & Strasburger, 1992). Almeida,
McGonagle, and King (2009) and Almeida, Piazza, and
Stawski (2009) provide additional information regarding
the assessment of cortisol in this study.
Cognitive Function
CF was assessed in a telephone interview using the Brief
Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT: Lachman &
Tun, 2008; Tun & Lachman, 2006). The BTACT assesses
key fluid cognitive domains, including episodic verbal
memory (immediate and delayed recall; Rey, 1964), work-
ing memory span (backward digit span; Wechsler, 1997),
EF (verbal fluency; Lezak, 1995), reasoning (letter series;
Salthouse, & Prill, 1987; Schaie, 1996), and speed of pro-
cessing (backward counting). A total CF score was obtained
by summing the scores on the immediate and delayed recall
STAWSKI ET AL.
i74
tasks and converting this to a z score. This standardized
memory score was then averaged with z scores for the re-
maining four tests to compute an overall composite score.
Factor analytic work also supports a two-factor model, broadly
representing EF and EM factors (Lachman, Agrigoroaei,
Murphy, & Tun, in press). EF was a z-score composite of
the digit span backward, category fluency, number series,
and backward counting tasks, and EM was a z-score com-
posite of the immediate and delayed recall tasks.
Covariates
Smoking Status.--Smoking status was determined by re-
spondents identifying themselves as routine smokers as
well as the number of cigarettes an individual reported con-
suming on a daily basis during the study period. Individuals
who did not identify themselves as smokers or who did not
report smoking any cigarettes during the study protocol
were classified as nonsmokers. A dichotomous variable was
used to index smoking status.
Medication Use.--Participants reported their current use
of medications known to influence cortisol, including steroid
inhalers, steroid medications, medications containing corti-
sone, birth control pills, other hormonal medications, and/or
antidepressant/antianxiety medications (Granger, Hibel,
Fortunato, & Kapelewski, 2009). A dichotomous variable
was created to indicate whether a participant reported taking
any of the aforementioned medications currently.
Self-rated Health.--Participants rated their physical
health on a 5-point scale (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, 4 =
very good, 5 = excellent).
Data Reduction.--Cortisol data from 27 participants
(1.8% of the sample) identified as shift workers were
excluded. Furthermore, cortisol samples greater than 60
nmol/L (n = 331, 1.4%) and for which corresponding
collection times were missing (n = 220, <1%) were also
excluded. Thus, the final analytic sample comprised 1,473
participants providing 23,017 useable saliva samples.
Analytic Strategy
We modeled the diurnal rhythm of salivary cortisol using
a three-level, piecewise multilevel model, which allowed us
to explicitly model variability in cortisol levels across the
day, across days, as well as across people (Equation 1).
Time since the second cortisol sample is used as the time
metric for this model, so the inflection point for the piece-
wise model is set at the highest level of cortsol typically
observed in these data.

According to Equation (1), at Level 1, the cortisol level
at occasion o, on day d, for person i, is a function of an
intercept, which correspond to their cortisol level at the
time they provided their second sample (b0di
), and three
slope parameters. The first slope parameter (b1di
) reflects
the MR and captures the rate of change between the first
and second sampling occasions as a function of the
amount of time that elapsed between them. The last two
slope parameters (b2di
and b3di
) represent the DCS. Linear
and quadratic terms were included to capture both the rate
of decline and the deceleration in the rate of decline in
cortisol throughout the day as a function of the amount of
time that has elapsed since the time of the second sample.
Thus, all slope parameters can be interpreted as the rate
of change in cortisol per hour from the time the second
sample was taken.
At Level 2, the Level 1 intercept and slope parameters
become outcomes, and each person's intercept, MR, and
afternoon decline parameters on a given day are now pre-
dicted as a function of each person's average intercept (d00i
)
and slope (d10i
, d20i
, and d30i
) across the 4 days as well as
a person-centered time-varying covariate, wake-up time,
which allows for systematic day-to-day coupling between
when one wakes up and the magnitude of the slope param-
eters characterizing their daily cortisol rhythm.
At Level 3, the Level 2 parameters become outcomes,
and each person's average intercept, MR, and DCS slopes
across the days are given as a function of the sample average
intercept (g000) and slope (g100, g200, and g300) parameters.
CORTISOL AND COGNITION i75
Person-level predictors are also included at this level of
analysis and are included to model differences in the intercept,
MR, and DCS slopes as a function of individual differences in
wake-up time (g001, g101, g201, and g301), age (g002, g102, g202,
and g302), sex (g003, g103, g203, and g303), education (g004, g104,
g204, and g304), CF (g005, g105, g205, and g305), whether one is a
smoker (g006, g106, g206, and g306), took medications that would
confound cortisol assessments (g007, g107, g207, andg307), and
their self-rated health (g008, g108, g208, and g308). All predictors
were entered simultaneously, so the resulting estimates are
partialled for the other predictors in the model.
This model also contains a number of variance compo-
nents. v00i
, v10i
, and v10i
are Level 3 variance components and
reflect individual differences in the intercept, MR, and linear
DCS parameters, respectively. u0di
, u1di
, and u2d
are Level 2
variance components and reflect within-person, day-to-day
variability in the intercept, MR, and DCS slopes. Finally, eodi
is the Level 1, or residual variance, and reflects variability in
cortisol levels within-persons across the day (within-day).
Results
Table 2 presents the results of the model (Equation (1))
estimating associations between CF and cortisol slopes
covarying for wake-up time, age, sex, education, smoking
status, medication use, and self-rated health. The intercept
of the model reflects the levels of cortisol at the time of the
second sampling occasion (17.33 nmol/L). Since the model
was centered at the time of the second cortisol sample, the
MR estimate is negative and indicates that cortisol levels
increased 6.55 nmol/L per hour elapsed between the first two
samples. The DCS reflects the rate of change in cortisol levels
for each hour since the time of the second sample. Here, the
linear DCS slope parameter indicates that cortisol levels ini-
tially decreased at a rate of 2.00 nmol/L per hour initially, and
the quadratic DCS effect indicates that the rate of decline was
decelerating at a rate of .08 nmol/L per hour thereafter.
We observed a number of significant associations
between our covariates and the parameters of the cortisol
slopes. The within-person effect of wake-up time was sig-
nificant indicating that on days people woke up later than
usual, their cortisol levels at the second sampling occasion
were significantly higher than usual, their MR was flatter
than usual, and they exhibited a slightly greater rate of
deceleration of the DCS (ps < .05). Similarly, individual
differences in wake-up time were associated with these pa-
rameters as well indicating that people who, on average,
woke up later possessed lower cortisol levels at the second
sampling occasion, a flatter MR, and a greater rate of decel-
eration in their DCS (ps < .01). We also observed age differ-
ences in these parameters such that older adults had higher

levels of cortisol at the second sampling occasion, a steeper
MR, and steeper a DCS with a greater degree of deceleration
(ps < .01). Women exhibited significantly steeper MR and
DCS than did men (ps < .05). Smokers exhibited a steeper
MR and a flatter DCS than did nonsmokers (ps < .05). Par-
ticipants who reported better health had a steeper MR and
DCS. Neither medication use nor education was significantly
associated with any of the slope parameters. Importantly,
higher CF was associated with slightly higher levels of corti-
sol at the time of the second sampling occasion (p = .09) and
a steeper DCS (ps < .05). Alternatively, lower functioning in-
dividuals exhibited lower cortisol levels at the time of the sec-
ond sampling occasion and a flatter slope profile throughout
the afternoon and into the evening (see Table 2 and Figure 1).
Next, we considered how CF was associated with cortisol
levels at each sampling occasion. This was done by simply
restricting the statistical model shown in Equation (1) to
focus on each cortisol sampling occasions iteratively (i.e.,
four 2-level models), incorporating the same predictors and
covariates. This allowed us to consider the specificity of
the association between CF and cortisol levels at the four
occasions across the day (Figure 2). CF was associated
with significantly higher levels of cortisol upon waking
(estimate = .38, SE = .19, p = .05) and marginally at 30 min
postwaking (estimate = .47, SE = .25, p = .09) but lower
levels of before lunch (estimate=-.25, SE = .13, p = .04) and
bed (estimate = -.26, SE = .11, p = .01).
Next, we considered whether individual differences in EF
and EM were each uniquely associated with the parameters
of the diurnal rhythm of cortisol as well as cortisol levels at
each of the sampling occasions. To do this, we reestimated
the models used for the previous set of analyses but entered
EF and EM as simultaneous independent predictors. Higher
EF was associated with a steeper DCS (estimate = -.17,
SE = .07, p = .01) and a larger quadratic slope, reflecting a
greater rate of deceleration in the DCS (estimate = .008,
SE = .003, p = .02). No significant associations emerged
between EM and the MR or DCS.
A similar patterned emerged when considering EF and EM
as predictors of cortisol levels at each sampling occasion

(Table 3). Higher EF was associated with significantly lower
cortisol levels before lunch (estimate = -.26, SE = .13, p = .05)
and before bed (estimate = -.25, SE = .12, p = .05). Once again,
none of the effects with EM were statistically significant.
Age Differences in Cognition­Cortisol Associations
We also explored age differences in the associations
between our indices of cognition and cortisol by adding the
age by cognition interaction as a Level 3 predictor to Equa-
tion (1). None of the interactions were significant for either
the CF composite or the EF and EM composites (ps > .16).
We also explored whether age differences might be most
evident in the oldest segment of the sample by testing non
linear age effects and similarly found no evidence to sup-
port age effects (ps > .33).
Discussion
The current study produced a number of findings. First,
higher levels of CF were associated with healthier daily cor-
tisol profiles, including a steeper DCS, higher cortisol levels
upon waking and 30 min postwaking, and lower cortisol
levels before lunch and bedtime, three to six months later.
Second, the observed effects of CF on cortisol were largely
specific to individual differences in EF as EM showed no
significant unique associations with any index of cortisol.
Third, no significant age differences in the associations
between CF and cortisol were observed. Furthermore, our
confidence in these findings is bolstered by the emergence
of these significant effects after covarying for relevant con-
founding factors, including sex, education, smoking status,
medication use, and self-reported health. Finally, the cur-
rent results underscore the importance of the timing of
cortisol assessments and how cortisol levels across the
day might be associated with other variables of theoretical
interest.
As expected, higher levels of CF were associated with a
steeper DCS. This result is consistent with previous studies
showing a similar association between steeper DCS and
higher CF among older adults (Beluche et al., 2009; Fiocco
et al., 2006; Gerritsen et al., in press). The studies by Fiocco
and Gerritsen, however, showed a flatter DCS being associ-
ated with poorer EM, whereas Beluche and our study
observed associations specific to indices of EF. The sample
employed by Fiocco self-identified as having memory defi-
cits and suffered from a number of depressive symptoms,
whereas Gerritsen only observed the association among
older adults possessing a risk factor for memory impairment
and dementia, APOE-e4. Thus, clinical or disease-related
processes could be a confounding factor. Our results echo

those of Beluche who observed higher EF being associated
with a steeper DCS among a community-dwelling sample
of older adults and extend them to show similar associations
in a large national sample of midlife and older adults.
Contrary to expectations, CF was not significantly related
to the magnitude of the MR. One reason for the lack of
association could be that only two samples were used to
capture the MR. Other research examining the MR has em-
ployed more intensive sampling of cortisol levels proximal
to waking (e.g., Fries, Dettenborn, & Kirschbaum, 2009)
and observed a more complex pattern than we could. One
study that has examined the relationship between the MR
and CF did so among younger adults and failed to observe
an association (Pruessner et al., 2007). Thus, although the
existing body of research is small, there is little evidence to
suggest that individual differences in CF are reliably associ-
ated with the MR. The differential pattern of associations
between CF, the MR, and DS is consistent with recent re-
views, suggesting that the MR and DCS may be distinct
phenomena reflecting different underlying biological/
neuroendocrine processes (e.g., Clow, Thorn, Evans, &
Hucklebridge, 2004) and merits further empirical consider-
ation to better understand factors associated with each.
Associations among CF and cortisol levels at each of
sampling occasion revealed a complex, yet clear, set of find-
ings. Higher levels of CF were associated with higher corti-
sol levels upon waking and 30 min postwaking but lower
levels of cortisol before lunch and bed. These results are
consistent with previous research showing higher morning
cortisol levels and lower afternoon and evening cortisol
levels being associated with higher CF (Beluche et al.,
2009, Carlson & Sherwin, 1999; Gerritsen et al., in press).
There is, however, research showing that higher morning
cortisol levels are associated with lower CF (Kalmijn
et al., 1998; Kuningas et al., 2007). These studies sampled
cortisol in the morning but after the MR had occurred,
and cortisol levels would have likely started declining.
Thus, in terms of the timing of cortisol samples and their
expected association with CF, a simple distinction between
a.m. and p.m. seems a bit too gross. A positive association
between cortisol levels and CF might be expected within
the first hour of waking when cortisol levels are expected
to be higher and increasing. Once cortisol levels start to de-
cline after reaching the zenith, associations might become
negative. Together, these results suggest that one important
area of future research could be identifying how and when
CF and cortisol levels should be associated depending on
the timing of the cortisol sampling.
When considering how individual differences in EF and
EM were associated with the MR, DCS, and cortisol levels
at each sampling occasion, we found that the associations
were specific to EF. Higher levels of EF were associated
with a steeper DCS and lower cortisol levels before lunch
and bed. These results differ from the findings using the CF
composite in that EF was not significantly associated with
cortisol levels for either of the morning samples. The asso-
ciations between the CF composite and morning cortisol
levels were not particularly robust, and splitting this com-
posite into the EF and EM composites may have come at the
expense of reliability. The significant findings are, however,
consistent with previous research showing higher EF among
older adults with a steeper DCS and lower evening cortisol
levels (Li et al., 2006) and extends this research to show an
association that is observable in a national sample of midlife
and older adults.
Our failure to observe associations between EM and
cortisol is inconsistent with previous findings among aging
samples (Carlson & Sherwin, 1999; Gerritsen et al., in
press; Li et al., 2006) but could be due to differences in the
tasks used to assess EM or differences in the sample com-
position. Individual differences in EM may be more dis-
criminating during old age when age- and disease-related
processes reflected in EM and hippocampal function are
more prevalent as compared with midlife. Furthermore,
more generally, MIDUS was designed as a study of midlife
health and well-being. As such, the relative undersampling
of older adults may have worked against us for detecting
age differences in cognition­cortisol associations between
middle age and very old adults. Nonetheless, these results
suggest that DCS and cortisol levels across the day are
reliably associated with EF but that the associations may
depend on the time of day.
Our results are also consistent with recent theoretical
accounts, suggesting that CF, and in particular EF, is an
important predictor of neuroendocrine/HPA function (Power
et al., 2008) and health more broadly (Gottfredson & Deary,
2004; Williams et al., 2009). Although individual differ-
ences in EF were predictive of healthier diurnal cortisol
profiles, the mechanism(s) underlying this association is
unclear. Williams and colleagues have argued that EF is im-
plicated in self-regulation, including reactivity and recovery
from stress. Thus, one explanation could be that individual
possessing higher levels of EF may be better at tempering
their reactions to stressful experiences which in turn leads
them to have relatively healthier profiles of HPA axis func-
tion. Applehans and Leucken (2006) showed that higher EF
was associated with dampened cortisol reactivity to threat.
Similarly, using MIDUS/NSDE data, we have shown that
higher CF was associated with dampened emotional reactiv-
ity to daily stressors (Stawski, Almeida, Lachman, Tun, &
Rosnick, 2010). Future research aimed at understanding the
mechanism(s) underlying such cognition­health linkages
would be an important contribution.
Limitations
Our estimate of the MR was defined by two cortisol
samples and the DCS by three samples. More intensive
sampling of cortisol throughout the day will provide better
resolution of the slopes and trajectories of cortisol through
CORTISOL AND COGNITION i79
the day and allow for more precise test of how CF is associ-
ated with the MR and DCS. Recent work on the MR sug-
gests that sampling every 15 min from waking through at
least the first hour of the day may be needed to more accu-
rately capture the complete dynamics of morning cortisol
patterns (e.g., Hellhammer et al., 2007). Similarly, other
large-scale studies have shown that the shape of the DCS
may be more complex than the quadratic shape we pre-
sented here (e.g., Cohen et al., 2006), suggesting that more
frequent sampling (hourly or bihourly) could provide a
more comprehensive account of the dynamics of the DCS
and reveal additional important associations. More inten-
sive sampling regimens would also allow for a more precise
triangulation when the association between cognition and
cortisol changes direction.
Although we observed higher CF associated with higher
morning cortisol, Hellhammer and colleagues (2004) showed
hypocortisolism in the morning to be associated with better
health. Hellhammer defined hypocortisolism based on
6-day work of low morning cortisol levels and a dexameth-
asone suppression test, which provide a much stronger basis
for defining hypocortisolism. As such, we must view our
results with appropriate circumspection in that although
our results suggest a pattern of result reflecting relatively
healthier versus relatively unhealthier patterns and profiles
of cortisol, these results cannot be used as a concrete
barometer of truly healthy or unhealthy and unhealthy peo-
ple or hypocortisolism and hypercortisolism.
With respect to modeling the diurnal rhythm of cortisol,
there is not field-wide agreement on the "correct" way to
model the DCS as some research has modeled the DCS
from waking (e.g., Adam, Hawkley, Kudielka, & Cacioppo,
2006), whereas others, like ourselves, have modeled the DCS
from the peak or thereabouts (e.g., Kudielka, Broderick, &
Kirschbaum, 2003). Some have even used both in the same
study (Matthews, Schwartz, Cohen, & Seeman, 2006). A
systematic examination contrasting these different methods
and clear explication of the implications of each would be
of tremendous benefit.
The measure of CF was designed to be used as a brief
composite index for use in large-scale survey studies. It
should also be noted that our index of EF comprised four
indicators, whereas the index of EM comprised two indica-
tors, which reflected different dimensions of performance
on the same task. Thus, the reliability of these constructs
may have affected our ability to detect associations. Future
research would benefit from more thorough and systematic
examinations of examining how EF, EM, and cortisol levels
across the day are associated as well as consideration of
additional domains of cognition would be of interest.
Finally, the current study is cross-sectional and cannot
determine the direction of the association between cortisol
and cognition. Although CF was assessed 3­6 months prior
to cortisol, it is unlikely that the later affected the former.
We, however, do not know that 3­6 months is the most
relevant window of time for durable downstream effects of
cognition on cortisol. Longitudinal research tracking both
over time and better understanding lead­lag relationships
will be of great benefit for understanding the time course
over which these dynamic relationships occur.
Conclusions
The current study was successful in providing evidence for
a complex relationship between CF and healthy profiles and
levels of naturally occurring cortisol. Higher levels of CF
were associated with a steeper DCS, higher levels of cortisol
in the morning, proximal to waking, as well as lower cortisol
levels in the afternoon and evening, and these effects were
largely reflected in individual differences in EF but not EM.
The results of the current study underscore the importance of
the timing of cortisol sampling for understanding associa-
tions between naturally occurring daily cortisol and CF as
well as other variables of theoretical interest as relatively
higher levels of cortisol do not always appear to be bad.
