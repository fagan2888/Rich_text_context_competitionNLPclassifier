. . . in Europe, there is an anti-Americanism that at once can be
casual but also insidious.` Barack Obama, speaking in
Strasbourg, April 2009.1.
--Harnden (2009)
Introduction
After the election of President G. W. Bush and especially
after 9/11, it seemed to some that the United States adopted
radically changed attitudes to its allies and to its enemies.
Allies were to be led, not accommodated, and alliances were
to be temporary and purpose-specific. Enemies might be
attacked preemptively, and their regimes changed, and if
possible democratized in an American approved style. The
United States exhibited a new isolationism of perspective
along with a wider, more vigorous projection of its power
(Iwama, 2004).
Unsurprisingly, this apparent major change created a
European crisis of trust, which is now discussed openly by
politicians, commentators, and scholars. We want to examine
some solid data that could help us determine the strength of
European citizens'views of the United States at this apparent
point of change, and to allow an analysis of their different
dimensions, and the characteristics of those who held them.
In particular, we want to explore whether opposition to
American policies was accompanied by a desire for a more
integrated and powerful European Union (EU), one that
might become a countervailing economic and political power
to the United States. This leads us to try to link--at least
empirically--two hitherto largely separate literatures: that
on anti-Americanism with that on attitudes toward EU
integration.
The data are drawn from three Eurobarometer surveys for
the European Commission: those of March-April 2003,
October-November 2005, and September-October 2006. The
2006 survey is the most recent available that includes the
2003 survey's questions on EU respondents' attitudes to
American policy. For the 2003 survey, during whose collec-
tion period, the Iraq War began, some 23,000 citizens in the
then 15-member union were questioned, using face-to-face
home interviews in their national language. In the 2005 and
2006 surveys, almost 27,000 citizens in the now 27-country
EU were surveyed.1 The sample frame was those aged 15
and above, but we want to study the views of those who
could influence policy, that is voters, so we analyze respon-
dents aged 18 and above. The surveys' multi-stage random
probability design ensures a representative sample with
respect to metropolitan, urban, and rural areas. For each

Who Is Anti-American in the European
Union?
Colin W. Lawson1,2 and John Hudson1
Abstract
The term anti-Americanism has become common in public and academic debate in the last decade. Yet we have only limited
knowledge of those who hold such views. From 2003, 2005, and 2006 Eurobarometer data, almost 20% of European Union
(EU) respondents disapproved of U.S. policy in all five dimensions the surveys examined. Following the literature, this consistent
opposition is defined as anti-American. Anti-Americans exhibit systematic differences in age, education, geographical location,
policy preferences, and nationality. In addition, although anti-Americanism is associated with a preference for greater
European independence, perhaps surprisingly, it is also linked to a desire for a less federal and hence less powerful Europe. In
both sets of attitudes, to the United States and to the EU, there are substantial variations within countries between different
types of locality, which reinforces the view that it is too simplistic to describe a country as being anti-American or being
pro-European integration.

interviewee, the data included age, sex, educational level,
income, and nationality, plus some attitudinal variables.
We focus on the EU electors' answers to two sets of
questions:
1. Whether the respondent felt the United States played
a positive, negative, or neither a positive nor negative
role in (a) the search for world peace, (b) the fight
against terrorism, (c) the fight against world poverty,
(d) the protection of the world environment, and (e)
world economic growth. We are less interested in the
responses to any specific question than in the totality
of such responses. In particular, building on Berman
(2004), we define an anti-American mind-set as one
that consistently disapproves of U.S. policies across a
range of different policy dimensions.
2. Whether the respondent felt that independent EU
defence, security and foreign policies were desirable.
We look for possible links between respondents`
answers to these questions and their views on U.S.
foreign policy.
We aim to answer three basic questions:
Research Question 1: Is there clear evidence of the exis-
tence of anti-Americanism as we define it?
Research Question 2: Is anti-Americanism random, or is
it linked to certain personal characteristics, for example,
nationality, level of education, or residence in a particular
part of a country?
Research Question 3: Do those with anti-American
views also share an identifiably similar set of opinions on
either the foreign or security policies of the EU or its
future political development?
The "Literature Review" section of this article discusses the
definition of anti-Americanism and surveys the literature. It
also reviews the literature on voters' attitudes to European
Integration. The "Attitude Determination" section provides the
justification for the model of attitude determination that under-
lies the empirics. The "Data and Analysis" section gives the
results, and the "Conclusion" summarizes our conclusions.
Literature Review
Here, we define anti-Americanism and review the existing
literature on its extent and causes.
Defining Anti-Americanism
As O'Connor (2012) observes, this term has been widely and
sometimes loosely used. What is needed is a definition that
corresponds to observable phenomena. For example, Spiro
(1988) defines anti-Americanism as "a persistent pattern of
gross criticism of the main values of the US Constitution" (p.
120). This is both too vague, for the values need to be defined,
and too specific. For example, why is it confined to the
Constitution?
Alternatively, Krastev (2004) defines anti-Americanism
as "opposing any policy simply because it is endorsed by the
US government" (pp. 6-7). This is an appealing definition,
because it incorporates a significant theoretical distinction
between opposition based on the effects of American policy
and opposition to the policy because it isAmerican. However,
Eurobarometer data do not allow us to establish why voters
have specific views. Other definitions include "any hostile
act or expression that becomes part and parcel of an undif-
ferentiated attack on the foreign policy, society, culture and
values of the United States" (Rubinstein & Smith, 1988,
p.36) and "a psychological tendency to hold negative views
of the United States and of American society in general"
(Keohane and Katzenstein, 2007b, p.273).
Berman (2004) provides a more tractable definition that
focuses on opposition to specific American policies, or
groups of policies. This allows a search for clusters of oppo-
sition, across policies, countries, or respondents, without
prejudging their cause. Such a definition is value neutral and
operational. Blaydes and Linzer (2012) empiricalize this by
averaging the normalized responses to seven questions relat-
ing to whether people had favorable views of the United
States and Americans, attitudes to the spread of American
customs, American ideas about democracy, ways of doing
business culture, and scientific advances. Chiozza (2009a)
also defines anti-Americanism as an attitude and a political
belief that can be measured through the answers individuals
give to survey questions.
We think it is worth extending the range of opinions that
are used to assess the pattern of anti-Americanism, by
including policy effects as well as policies. We also narrow
our focus onto those who hold consistently negative views
of U.S. policies or of their effects. Our measure of anti-
Americanism is similar to that of Blaydes and Linzer
(2012) in being based on several different responses. But
unlike theirs, it is not a continuous variable but a binomial
one based on those who consistently have a negative opin-
ion of the United States. We extend the range to both poli-
cies and policy effects, because it is not clear that
respondents distinguish between them, and Eurobarometer
questions involve both. We confine our description of anti-
American to those who have consistently negative views in
all five of the examined U.S. policy dimensions because
we want to explore links with their views on the EU.
Opposition to an individual policy could arise for a myriad
of reasons, and have little or no linkage to common con-
cepts of anti-Americanism. In addition, if there is nothing
unusual in our narrowly defined anti-American group's
pattern of views on the EU, then in the survey data, there
are likely to be few interesting links between the wider
group of European voters' views of the United States and
their views on the future of the EU.

The Literature on Attitudes Toward the United
States and Its Policies
Opinion poll evidence for European anti-American views in
the early years of this century, summarized by Linn (2004),
revealed a growing negative view of the United States,
though with marked differences across European states, and
more positive views in recent EU members. Kohut (2003)
quotes a 2001 State Department survey:
Where 78% of Germans said they had a favorable view of the
U.S. That fell to 61% in our (Pew Research Center) 2002 poll--
and to 45% in the survey conducted (in spring 2003). Opinion of
the U.S. in France has followed a similar track: 62% positive in
1999-2000, 63% (in 2002) . . . and 43% (in 2003). (pp. 1-2)
However, according to both Linn and Kohut, although EU
public opinion has changed, the U.S.­EU "value divide" is
not widening. Linn (2004) defines "basic values" as "views
regarding fundamental, life and death issues that are embed-
ded in traditional culture and do not vary quickly or signifi-
cantly over time" (p. 13). Such values might be the roles of
the individual and the state, belief in God, or the necessary
conditions for a just war. These he contrasts with "`public
opinion' [which although it] refers to views and perceptions
mainly on matters of current politics or events . . . " can and
generally does "also cover and reflect basic values" (Linn,
2004, p.13). These authors believe that the recent growth in
anti-Americanism reflects changing European public opin-
ion rather than a basic value change.
However, even if there has been no profound change in
European values, some American commentators have taken
a very combative line. For example, Ceaser (2003) claims
that anti-Americanism in Europe influenced Islamic terror-
ists. He traces anti-Americanism back to the 18th-century
biological degeneracy thesis that all species, including
human beings, thrived less well in the New World. By the
late-18th century, this then dominant view also appeared in a
political variant that asserted the inferiority of the American
political system because it was not grounded in tradition. For
Ceaser, anti-Americanism
. . . is a construct of European thought . . . anti-Americanism
makes rational discussion impossible, it threatens the idea of a
community of interests between Europe and America. Indeed it
threatens the idea of the West itself. (p. 16)
One does not have to accept Ceaser's extreme account to
agree that the United States's power, and hence its pervasive
influence, has created the preconditions for distrust of its
motives. The U.S. response to 9/11, and especially the inva-
sion of Iraq, produced widespread European opposition. The
more radical criticism went beyond policy disagreement and
purported to examine alleged flaws in the American psyche
that led to the violent and intimidating behavior that, some
argued, has marked America since its inception (Sardar &
Davies, 2002, 2004).
A common view in the literature argues that attitudes to
the United States are strongly influenced by views of
American leaders and what they do, but also by views of the
American people (Chiozza, 2009b, p. 283). A related view
claims that non-Americans can and do distinguish between
"what America is" and "what America does" (Keohane &
Katzenstein, 2007a, p. 2). The latter argue that because
America encompasses a very wide range of values and life-
styles, it provides foreigners with many reasons for attraction
and repulsion. This helps explain the phenomenon of those
who may oppose its foreign policy but still wish to work
there.
The degree of distrust of America varies across European
countries, most plausibly because of past contacts. However,
opinions are constantly evolving. Germany and France pro-
vide two examples. Although relatively pro-American,
Germans have recently become more distrustful. Berman
(2004) claims,
. . . there is a specific German continuity from pre-1989
Communist anti-Americanism to post-Communist anti-
Americanism, which has been particularly relevant, given the
role of the former Communist Party--the Party of Democratic
Socialism (PDS)--and its ability to influence the larger German
political landscape. (p.29)
Other influences he cites are the
. . . association of Americans with "capitalism in a negative
sense"; a " . . . pre-democratic anti-Americanism (that) finds
expression in contempt for aspects of American mass culture,"
and "a post-democratic anti-Americanism . . . driven by
resentment that the United States has been unwilling to cede
sovereignty to the structures of international governance."
(p.30)
However, French opinion is arguably the most anti-Amer-
ican. Meunier (2005) argues that " . . . France is the country
with the deepest, most sedimented reservoir of Anti-
American arguments" (p. 127). Toinet (1988), a French com-
mentator sympathetic to the United States, argued that after
its critical help to the United States in the War of
Independence, France looked in vain for a "special relation-
ship" with the new state. Instead, relations were punctuated
by intermittent tensions. For example, France interpreted the
1898American attack on the Spanish empire in the Caribbean
and the Philippines as a threat to all European empires. The
United States did not forgive France its First World War
debts. Roosevelt initially favored Vichy over the Free French
and wanted a retributive postwar military government for
France. But even such an unpromising legacy cannot explain
the severity of some criticisms. Toinet's explanation is that
French commentators see a clash between the ideals of
French civilization and American advocacy of its view of
democracy. For the commentators, American democracy has
led to and entails an unacceptably rapacious and uncaring
form of capitalism (Grunberg, 2005; Todd, 2003).
4 SAGE Open
It is possible to construct a systematic and wide-ranging
explanation of anti-Americanism by focusing on its origins
in domestic European politics. For example, Fabbrini (2002)
notes that " . . . in (continental) Europe, anti-Americanism
seems to be one of the few public philosophies that can unite
large sections of the left, the right and the Catholic Church"
(p. 3). He argues that there are clear, though different, rea-
sons why these diverse movements should exhibit this phi-
losophy. On the left is the legacy of the Cold War, former
communist parties explicitly opposed to the United States,
and socialist parties opposed to the perceived excesses of
American capitalism. On the right are parties that are dis-
trustful of American liberalism, individualism, and anti-
paternalism. The Catholic Church's skepticism he argues
originates in the key role of protestant sects in American reli-
gious life, the separation of Church and State in theAmerican
constitution, and the individualism that lies at the heart of
American identity. Despite this, the evidence presented in,
for example, Keohane and Katzenstein (2007b) shows little
evidence of any consequences of anti-Americanism on the
United States itself.
In terms of specific empirical econometric analysis,
Chiozza's (2009a) analysis of people across the world is of
particular importance. He shows that variation in anti-Ameri-
can sentiment is explained more at the individual level rather
than at the level of the country. He also finds that no single
variable is of primary importance in explaining anti-Ameri-
canism and that the impact of socio-economic characteristics
varies in different parts of the world. Finally, he shows that
anti-Americanism, except perhaps in some Islamic countries,
is not an entrenched philosophy around the world. Blaydes
and Linzer (2012) in their study of anti-Americanism in the
Islamic world link anti-Americanism to both individual socio-
economic characteristics and country-level variables.
The Literature on Citizens' Attitudes to European
Integration
Haas (1961) argues that European co-operation would lead,
through a "spillover" mechanism, to unintended conse-
quences that would eventually lead to firms, governments,
political parties, and citizens to orient their expectations and
political behavior toward the EU. Moreover, the citizens of
European countries would gradually come to view "Europe"
as the natural focus for their political activities and loyalty
(Haas, 1968). Thus, integration would gradually produce a
convergence of beliefs, values, and aspirations that would
unite the peoples of the European community. Haas (1976)
did later become more skeptical of this view, as it seemed as
if progress in the EU to further integration had slowed down,
although the subsequent development of the single market,
the Schengen Agreement, EU enlargement toward the east,
and the birth of the euro expanded co-operation over both
functions and territory (Fligstein, Polyakova, & Sandholtz,
2012). However, as Fligstein et al. (2012) also note, this
increased co-operation does not seem to have been matched
by a growth in public support for the EU or a shared European
identity. In part, this may be because issues such as immigra-
tion, the "war on terror," and slow economic growth and the
financial crisis have caused citizens to focus more on their
national governments. But also following the 1992 Maastricht
Treaty, the balance in the EU has shifted from economic
toward political and cultural integration (Fligstein et al.,
2012). For some Europeans, such developments and the
expansion in the EU institution's role in governance threaten
national identity while formalizing a European supranational
identity (Fligstein et al., 2012). This may have resulted in the
EU being looked on less favorably by some citizens (Shore,
2000). But equally perhaps, it may have led others to identify
more with the EU; that is, it may have polarized views.
These are important developments because there is evi-
dence that less supportive citizens are more Eurosceptic
(Usherwood & Startin, 2013). In addition, governments are
unlikely to support further political, social, or economic inte-
gration if their citizens are not supportive of the EU (Down
& Wilson, 2013). Hence, an understanding of the determi-
nants of public support for the EU and for European integra-
tion is also important if we are to understand the direction the
EU is likely to move in over the coming decades.
Verhaegen, Hooghe, and Quintelier (2014) argue that sup-
porting greater EU integration involved a cost­benefit calcu-
lation, a view empirically supported by Gabel (1998) and
Sanchez-Cuenca (2000). This implies that the winners from
EU integration will tend to be in favor of integration, and
support the EU itself, whereas the losers will tend to hold
opposite views. Consistent with this perspective, Fligstein
et al. (2012) argue that European economic and cultural inte-
gration have tended to involve those from the higher end of
the socio-economic spectrum. However, blue-collar, lower
white-collar, service, and older workers have benefited less
and will tend to favor their own governments over the EU. In
terms of empirical work, Verhaegen et al. examine percep-
tions that EU membership is good for the country and per-
ceptions of a European identity, rather than attitudes to
further integration per se. They find personal characteristics
such as age and gender to be significant in determining sup-
port for the EU, as well as occupational variables, the indi-
vidual's financial position, and country variables linked to
the economic situation, the date of joining the EU, and
Eurozone membership. The pattern of significance tends to
suggest, as indicated above, that the winners, in terms of
those who are doing well, tend to support the EU more than
others.
Kuhn and Stoeckel (2014) analyze support for European
economic governance, again using survey data. In practice,
their dependent variables are averaged perceptions of whether
a greater EU role in economic governance in several dimen-
sions would or would not be effective, rather than whether the
individual would support such a development. The most sig-
nificant variable is, unsurprisingly, trust in EU institutions.
Lawson and Hudson 5
Other socio-economic variables, for example, age, gender,
education, and occupation, are not that significant.
Kritzinger (2003) presents an alternative view to the eco-
nomic self-interest based approach and emphasizes the polit-
ical, economic, cultural, and historical contexts in which
attitudes developed. The key role of national concerns in
European parliamentary elections supports this hypothesis
(Franklin, Van der Eijk, & Marsh, 1995). Lacking specific
EU knowledge, voters use their evaluations of domestic poli-
tics (Anderson, 1998). Much of their general EU information
is also filtered through national politicians. Garry and Tilley
(2009) also argue that apart from a cost­benefit calculation,
attitudes are influenced by national identity. But there is little
agreement on the nature of this influence. Carey (2002) links
a strong sense of national identity with anti-integration
views. Haesly (2001) finds the opposite. Garry and Tilley
reconcile these conclusions by arguing that the impact
depends on the country's situation, for example, with respect
to income per capita. In passing, we note that their control
variables included age, sex, employment status, and educa-
tion level, finding support for the EU to be associated with
being relatively highly educated, middle class, male, and sat-
isfied with the country's economic performance.
Ordinary citizens may link their views of national and EU
politics in one of two opposed ways. The "equal assess-
ments" hypothesis suggests that people interpret both from
similar viewpoints, perhaps because national politicians also
participate in inter-governmental meetings (Anderson,
1998). A counter perspective sees national and EU politics as
alternatives, even rivals: Those disillusioned with one may
see the other as a more attractive way forward. Using 1994
Eurobarometer data, Kritzinger (2003) concludes that "the
EU is used as a proxy for symbolic protest against the present
national political and economic situation" (p. 237).
The impact of anti-Americanism on EU citizens'views on
defense policy has been analyzed by Ray and Johnston
(2007). They used Eurobarometer data for 2003 and 2004,
for the EU-15 members, and concluded that anti-American-
ism was positively associated with support for EU, rather
than NATO-led defense policy. They also noted that " . . .
anti-Americanism does push some Europeans away from
multilateral defense policymaking altogether" (Ray &
Johnston, 2007, p. 88). This latter group tended to favor a
national approach to defense policy.
Attitude Determination
Respondents' Attitudes Toward U.S. Policies
Because anti-Americanism, the key variable that we analyze,
is binary, we use probit regression. The literature review
showed that there has been some empirical research into
anti-Americanism, much of the early work focusing on dif-
ferences between countries rather than on individuals within
countries. However, more recent work has focused on
individual attitudes across a range of countries (Blaydes &
Linzer, 2012; Chiozza, 2009a; Chiozza, 2009b ). The novel-
ties in this article are that it uses a different variable to mea-
sure anti-Americanism, one based on consistent opposition
to American policies, rather than a continuous variable. It
also analyzes the evolution of attitudes across several years.
Finally, it includes the first empirical analysis that explores a
possible link between EU citizens' opinions on U.S. policies
and their opinions on EU integration. There has been specu-
lation on whether anti-Americanism has had adverse effects
on the United States, for example, on its political influence
and economic interests. But there has been much less analy-
sis of the effects on other countries.
A theoretical determination of citizens' views of the United
States's policies is not set out formally here. Our purpose rather
is to explore whether there are any interesting empirical regu-
larities in the data. We do not presuppose that respondents'
views are in the main irrational or prejudiced. Neither do we
presuppose the contrary. A predisposition to take a positive or
negative view of U.S. policy may be perfectly consistent with a
set of goals that respondents could have articulated, but we can-
not deduce from their recorded answers. We neither assume nor
can deduce their answers reflect any predisposition.
The primary independent variables of interest are those
relating to the individual's characteristics, the country fixed
effects, and the individual's policy preference variables. We
focus on four policy issues: terror, the economy, defense, and
the environment, using a simple measure that reflects
whether the individual thought they were important. These
are included because, for example, individuals' attitudes to
U.S. policies may in part depend on the relative importance
they place on the environment as compared with terrorism as
policy issues. Country-specific attitudes will differ, and
again memory will be relevant, although this time, it is likely
to be the collective memory of a nation that, as noted above,
determines attitudes to the United States.
Following common practice in analyzing political atti-
tudes, and also consistent with some of the work we have
referenced, our control variables include the socio-economic
variables of age, education, sex, occupation, a measure of the
respondents' household income relative to their country's
average household income, and a variable that reflects
respondents' trust in big business. Underlying their inclusion
is the belief that individual attitudes are partially determined
by individual circumstances and knowledge. Not all these
variables are available for all three surveys.
The variables are defined in the appendix. A brief ratio-
nale for their inclusion is as follows.
The literature survey indicated that views of U.S. policy
or its effects may be influenced by respondents' views of the
U.S. government, people, culture, power, and social and eco-
nomic systems. Attitudes toward these factors have changed
over time and location.Attitudes may be partly influenced by
knowledge, including personal experience. To some extent,
they may be related to social norms and hence reference
6 SAGE Open
groups, conventional wisdom, and even irrational bias. In
turn, these influences can sometimes be linked to the inde-
pendent variables used here.
For example, educated people may be more aware of
issues such as the violation of human rights in Abu Ghraib,
or climate change, which in turn could fuel a blanket opposi-
tion to U.S. policies. Variables such as age, sex, and educa-
tion may be related to direct experience of American culture,
including music, films, or fast food outlets that may be fac-
tors influencing respondents' attitudes to America. Age may
also be relevant in providing a direct memory of periods such
as the Cold War and the Second World War2 when American
power was often viewed more favorably than in the Bush era.
Location can also influence exposure to American culture:
For example, exposure to fast food outlets or U.S. multina-
tionals is more likely in large cities than rural areas.
Respondents' Attitudes to European Integration
The focus is on policies with international spillovers, defense
related foreign policy, and also the EU constitution. We fol-
low Verhaegen et al. (2014) and others, and assume those
who favor greater European integration feel that they will
benefit from it--individually or altruistically, or both. Their
views are uninfluenced by the appropriate service delivery
level (Oates, 1999), because this is a given. International
influence and defense capability increase with economic
size. Hence, a united EU voice has more impact than any
single member country, and possibly more than the sum of
all members. But integration also entails a loss of sover-
eignty, and a country may become committed to support and
finance policies it opposes.
Individual differences toward EU integration will thus
arguably largely depend on how the individual perceives the
national interest and the extent to which they are willing to
trade national sovereignty for a greater global role. Such atti-
tudes are likely to be driven by national pride and identity, and
therefore, we include the socio-economic factors that are stan-
dard in this type of analysis as well as country fixed effects.
In addition, we also include attitudes to the United States.
There are two possibilities. The first and most obvious is that
anti-Americanism will drive European integration. This is
consistent with an analysis of the institutional choices of EU
constitutional delegates in the area of EU foreign policy
(Jensen, Slapin, & Koenig, 2007). They found that delegates
from states that had not deployed troops in support of the
U.S.-led Iraq invasion were more likely to support EU inte-
gration. Their explanation was that such states would be
more interested in creating a European foreign policy capa-
ble of counterbalancing the United States because they are
more opposed to U.S. policy. But with individual citizens'
attitudes, there is also the reverse possibility: that people are
opposing a superpower and will not want to see a second
superpower grow from the nations of Europe, although, or
perhaps especially as, they will be part of that superpower.
Data and Analysis
We have already described the Eurobarometer sample frame
and interview procedures. Our probit regressions use the sur-
vey's attitudinal and characteristics data to explore their
inter-linkages. The variables are defined in the appendix.
The key variable is, of course, the one relating to anti-Amer-
icanism, and it is measured by sustained opposition to
American policies across five dimensions of policies: peace,
terrorism, poverty, the environment, and world growth.
Attitudes to the EU are measured in relation to voter sup-
port for a greater co-ordination of defense policy, foreign
policy, an EU military rapid reaction force, a common crisis
response position, and greater independence of foreign pol-
icy from the United States. In the two more recent surveys,
data on the last three were not available, but there was infor-
mation on support for an EU constitution. The constitution
apart, these are predominantly foreign policy and defense
issues that could be addressed by inter-state agreements.
Hence, greater EU co-ordination implies a reduction in
national sovereignty. Of course, to an extent, this is also the
case for the EU constitution. In our analysis of the 2003 sur-
vey, the individuals'incomes were approximated by the mid-
point of the income range in which the survey placed them.
Their relative income was calculated as the ratio of this
approximation to the country average. In the later surveys,
data on income were not reported, but data on life satisfac-
tion and, in the 2005 survey, on individual personal circum-
stances in the recent past were available and were used.
Voters' Views on U.S. Policies
Table 1 reports attitudinal variables. The first column in the
top half of Table 1 records the proportion classified as anti-
American in 2003, that is, disapproving of U.S. policy with
respect to all five policy areas of peace, terror, poverty, envi-
ronment, and growth. The alternatives include positive
views and respondents with neither positive nor negative
feelings. The proportions are quite high and much higher
than would be the case if views were randomly distributed
between alternatives across the different issues. Thus, in
France, in the 2003 sample, randomly distributed attitudes
would lead to 9.6%3 disapproving of U.S. policy on all five
dimensions, not the 34.7% we see, and in the United
Kingdom, we would have seen less than 0.1% defined as
anti-American not 9.2%.
There are also considerable differences between countries
for the three surveys (2003; 2005; 2006). At one extreme, we
have France (34.7%; 28.1%; 27.4%), Spain (33.2%; 36.3%;
30.0%), and in particular Greece (68.0%; 64.1%; 62.9%)
with a very high proportion of people classified as consis-
tently disapproving of American policies. At the other
extreme, Denmark (7.5%; 8.0%; 9.7%) and Sweden (10.2%;
8.2%; 10.4%) have only small minorities classified as anti-
American. But across the 3 years, an average of seven EU-15

countries had more than 20% of respondents holding nega-
tive views on all five issues.
The bottom half of the table also extends the number of
countries to the 27 EU members for the 2005 and 2006 sur-
veys. The new member countries except for Cyprus (45.0%;
53.3%) and Slovenia (29.7%; 21.9%) are much less critical
of the United States than "old Europe."
Table 2 reports the 2006 distribution of the population
disagreeing with U.S. policies in terms of the number of
issues. Ordering the distribution in this way reveals the wide
range of approval or disapproval patterns across countries.
Greece and Cyprus again stand out as having high levels of
disagreement with the United States on all issues and the
East European countries and Malta as having very low levels
of disagreement. Ireland and Italy have high levels of zero
disagreements, but a growing number of multiple disagree-
ments. France, Germany, Finland, Belgium, and Luxembourg
have few who are strongly supportive, but large numbers
who are unsupportive on multiple issues. Austria, the United
Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, and Slovenia show varying
degrees of polarized disagreement patterns, with zero and
five disagreements as the two modes. Spain and Portugal are
strikingly polarized. Sweden exhibits the opposite pattern,
with two as the mode; and the Netherlands's views are almost
equally distributed across the categories.
Table 3 gives the regression results for attitudes to U.S. poli-
cies. The use of squares of ages allows different age cohorts to
have different reactions, perhaps reflecting the history of U.S.
involvement in Europe, perhaps reflecting evolving self-inter-
est. Not all of the empirical papers we have discussed included
age squared as opposed to just age. But it does allow for atti-
tudes to flatten out as people age and indeed even reverse. Note
that because of the variation in some questions across the three
surveys, replication of results cannot always be tested.
1. In 2005 and 2006, age has a non-linear impact, sig-
nificant at the 1% level, which indicates that consis-
tent opposition to American policies first increases
and then declines with age. Based on the regression
equations 3.2 and 3.4 from Table 3, in 2006 and 2005,
the turning points are 50.4 and 50.6 years,
respectively.
2. In 2005 and 2006, more educated people were sig-
nificantly more hostile than less educated people.
3. In 2003, as income increased, hostility to American
policies declined. In 2005 and 2006, people who

be less hostile to U.S. policies than those who lived in
small towns, who again were less hostile than those
who lived in cities.

the height of the Cold War more supportive toward the
United States. The United States's association with capital-
ism may attract the wealthy.
Attitudinal variables are significant along several dimen-
sions. Concern with terrorism tends to increase broad sup-
port for U.S. policies. The environment is also a key issue of
increasing salience, with those who felt the environment to
be important disapproving of American policies. But even
more than the environment, attitude to big business is a
defining issue. In the 2 years for which we have data, mis-
trust of big business is highly significant in increasing disap-
proval for American policies.
Columns 3.3, 3.6, and 3.9 show the marginal effects, that
is, the impact on the probability of being anti-American of a
change in the variable. Hence, we can see that for someone
who lives in a village, the probability of being anti-American
declines by .0212 in the 2006 regression, compared with
someone who lives in a large city. Hence, if a city dweller's
characteristics are such that the probability of being anti-
American is .2012, for someone with the same characteris-
tics who lives in a village or rural area, the probability would
be just .180. The figure for 2005 is very similar. These are
average responses and give a misleading impression of
impact for age. Thus, for the 2006 regression, if we evaluate
the impact at age 25 and 65, then the marginal effects are
0.0013 and -0.00079, respectively, both significant at the
1% level. These indicate that as someone moves from 25 to
26, the probability of being anti-American increases by
approximately .0013 and as someone aged 65 moves to 66,
then the probability declines by .00079. These are relatively
small changes, but if we look at what happens when someone
ages a decade, then the change from age 25 to 35 is to
increase the probability from .168 to .178. Similarly, when
someone ages from 65 to 75, the relative probabilities are
.179 and .169, respectively.
The country coefficients reflect differences in attitudes
compared with a base country--here Finland. The choice of
Finland has no substantive impact on the results. Choosing a
different country would have altered the size of the country
dummy coefficients, but not their relative ordering. These
country fixed effects are not shown in the tables, but Figure
1 reflects their average marginal effects values from the
regressions 3.2 and 3.5 of Table 3.4 Hence, given all other
variables, it reflects an attitude to the United States, which
characterizes the country as a whole. Of the EU-15, the least
favorabletotheUnitedStatesareGreece,Spain,Luxembourg,
and France. Sweden and Denmark are more favorable. In
general, the new entrants are more favorable to the United
States with the exception of Slovenia and Cyprus. But it is
clear on this that "new Europe" is less disapproving of the
United States than "old Europe." The difference between
France and the United Kingdom has narrowed throughout
the 3 years, with both countries showing some convergence.
Nonetheless, based on the 2006 regression, 3.1 for a "repre-
sentative individual,"5 the probability of being opposed to
U.S. policies on all 5 issues is .23 in the United Kingdom and
substantially greater at .31 in France.
We also show at the foot of the table the different log like-
lihoods from (a) excluding country fixed effects and (b)
including just country fixed effects. The log likelihoods of
the former are consistently much closer to zero, indicating
higher explanatory power than the latter. This implies that
Lawson and Hudson 11
most of the variability in responses is between countries
rather than across socio-economic characteristics.
Voters' Views of EU Policies
Table 1 also shows basic data on respondents'attitudes toward
EU policies. Specifically, it shows the proportion who
approved of greater EU integration or co-operation out of all
those surveyed, including "don't knows." In 2003, a large
majority of respondents in all EU countries favored foreign
policy independence from the United States. Other foreign
and defense issues follow a similar pattern. The only excep-
tion was U.K. respondents' views on a more coordinated
foreign policy, with slightly less than half of those questioned
in favor. This general pattern of support was largely repeated
in 2005 and 2006 even among the new EU entrants.
In Table 4, we focus on the relationship between respon-
dents' attitudes to the United States and their support for
European integration. The regressions have been estimated
by ordered probit. In the 2003 sample regressions, the binary
variable, "anti-American," reflecting negative attitudes
along the five dimensions of support for the United States, is
significant. That is, those classified as anti-American are
more likely to support an EU foreign policy more indepen-
dent of the United States's. They are, however, less likely to
support EU defense policy co-ordination and also foreign

policy co-ordination, the creation of a rapid reaction force,
and holding common positions in the face of crises.6
Turning to the other variables, support for greater EU
independence from the United States increased with the level
of education and was higher for men. Men were also more
favorable to an expanded EU role in foreign and defense
issues, including a rapid reaction force. Country dummies
(not shown) suggest that Denmark and Finland were the
most hostile to the force, with Greece, Belgium, and France
being the most favorable. Responses reflect both attitudes to
integration and willingness to project military force. On the
individual policy preferences, concern with the economy
tended to be associated with support for a stronger EU.
Finally, mistrust of national governments and, to an extent,
big business was linked to reduced support for a stronger EU.
In the 2005 and 2006 samples, there were questions on
attitudes to defense and foreign policy but not on the other
issues. However, there was an additional question on the EU
constitution. The results were largely consistent with those
for 2003 with respect to the impact of anti-Americanism.
They were also similar with respect to education and atti-
tudes to the economy, although the latter was less significant
in 2006. Concern for the environment and terrorism was,
however, significant in affecting attitudes in both 2005 and
2006. In addition, those whose personal situation had dete-
riorated tended to be more hostile to a strengthening EU.
Distrust of big business and government also tended to
reduce support for EU integration.
We again show at the foot of the table the different log
likelihoods from excluding country fixed effects and includ-
ing just country fixed effects. In this case, the two are much
closer together than for the anti-Americanism regressions.
This implies that socio-economic characteristics are rela-
tively much more important compared with country charac-
teristics in determining attitudes to the EU than in explaining
anti-Americanism. This result may well reflect the fact that
the EU has a much greater direct impact on European citi-
zens than American policies.
Conclusion
We defined anti-Americanism as consistent opposition to
U.S. policy and focused our study on those EU voters who
took a negative view of that policy in all of the five dimen-
sions covered in the Eurobarometer surveys. Our three ques-
tions were as follows:
Research Question 1: Is there clear evidence of the exis-
tence of anti-Americanism in the EU electorate?
Research Question 2: Is anti-Americanism random, or is
it linked to certain personal characteristics?
Research Question 3: Do those who consistently disap-
prove of U.S. policies also share an identifiably similar
set of opinions on the foreign policy or future political
development of the EU?
The first of these questions may seem like something of a
non-issue given the amount of work that has been done on
this. But our results are based on a different measure of anti-
Americanism than has been used before. In addition, our
results show evidence for both anti-Americanism and pro-
Americanism sentiments within the countries of the EU,
although we focus almost solely on the former. But we do not
find, as does Chiozza (2009a), that individual characteristics
are more important than country ones, although, of course,
this relative importance will depend on the heterogeneity
within and between countries in the sample analyzed.
Nonetheless, our results show strong evidence of anti-Amer-
icanism linked to age, education, policy preferences, national
origin, and in particular, mistrust of big business. The latter
strongly suggests that a root cause of anti-American attitudes
is anti-capitalism. If so, the financial crisis and economic
stagnation of 2008-2014 are unlikely to increase support for
the United States, notwithstanding the considerably greater
popularity of President Obama outside America, compared
with that of his predecessor.
In "old Europe," anti-Americanism is less common in the
United Kingdom,7 Italy, Ireland, and Sweden. Greece,
France, and Spain stand out in having consistently more
unfavorable attitudes. As we noted, this pattern is consistent
with these countries' historical experiences. However, atti-
tudes to the United States are in general considerably more
positive in "new" than in "old Europe." EU expansion does
appear to have made its members, at least on average, less
hostile to U.S. policy.
Excepting Ireland, this pattern of country support also
matched explicit initial support for the Iraq war. It may also
have adversely affected American multinationals and U.S.
exports (Anholt & Hildreth, 2004). The lesson is that a "hard
power" victory can come at the expense of a "soft-power"
defeat (Nye, 2004).
European hostility to America also has implications for
the EU. We showed that EU voter anti-Americanism leads to
a demand for less dependence on the US, though not for an
EU to rival America. Indeed, the reverse is the case--disap-
proval of American policies was not linked to a desire for
greater European defense and foreign policy integration, nor
for an EU constitution. Hence, we have identified an impact
of anti-Americanism, not on the United States itself or its
policies, but on the EU. In the main, EU voters who feel
American policies have been bad for the world do not want a
more powerful EU. This may be because the EU is perceived
as closely aligned with the United States, or because the
United States represents an example of what the EU could
become. It may, however, be that in the future, the EU does
develop in a way that brings it more into conflict with the
United States both politically (McNamara, 2011) and eco-
nomically. In this case, it is possible that anti-Americanism
will be associated with support for a more integrated EU.
Finally, it is important to stress that there are important
differences across the countries between urban and rural
Lawson and Hudson 13
areas. Therefore, it can be an oversimplification to label a
country as being pro-EU integration or anti-American pol-
icy. Our analysis has also shown that within country differ-
ences have a much more similar impact on attitudes to
between country differences, than was the case for anti-
Americanism. Hence, if the EU is to increase support for
integration, then it has to focus on both levels, that is, on
those within countries who are skeptical and on those coun-
tries that are most skeptical. In comparing our results with
others, the diversity of empirical definitions that have been
used to proxy both anti-Americanism and EU integration
should be borne in mind.
The conclusions we have reached provide an extensive
and nuanced answer to the question in our title "Who Is anti-
American in the European Union." We relied on large scale
and repeated surveys of public opinion. But it is worth recall-
ing an important limitation of this type of analysis. The data
do not allow us to distinguish opinion from distrust or indeed
bias and prejudice. That limitation can be important if the
views we have recorded influence EU or EU member states'
policy. The obvious extension to our research would be to
explore the impact of European anti-Americanism on
European policy and relations with the United States.

1. As well as a small number in potential European Union (EU)
countries that we do not analyze.

2. Memories of both periods may vary across EU countries.
3. There are several ways of calculating expected anti-Ameri-
canism that incorporate the assumption that each outcome is
equally probable. For example, the quoted figure for France
is based on the assumption that the 72.9%, 48.3%, 53.9%,
73.4%, and 69% who had negative views on U.S. policy with
respect to peace, terror, growth, the environment, and poverty
were distributed randomly across the population, with indi-
vidual views not being correlated across policies.
4. These relate to 2005 and 2006, the 2 years for which we have
a full complement of countries.
5. Defined here as a 40-year old town-based woman with a uni-
versity degree, who is fairly satisfied with her life and whose
personal situation has improved.
6. It seems unlikely that endogeneity, for example, that respon-
dents' attitudes to greater co-ordination of EU defense poli-
cies contribute to their disapproval of American policies, will
be a problem. But to test this hunch, we instrumented anti-
Americanism using the average degree of anti-Americanism
in the individual's region, as well as all the other explanatory
variables in Table 3. This average was calculated to exclude
the individuals themselves. We then re-estimated the regres-
sions in Table 4 with this instrumented variable, rather than
the anti-American variable per se. The Hausman test indicated
endogeneity might be a problem just once at the 1% level of
significance and one further time at the 5%, and also at 10%
level. The former related to attitudes to defense in 2006, despite
the coefficients being remarkably similar. For example, that
pertaining to anti-Americanism was 0.167 as opposed to 0.166
in Table 3. We did not use this regional variable in the regres-
sions in Table 3, as it would substantially affect the country
dummies, which are a particular concern of this article. It is
worth emphasizing that its inclusion had minimal impact on
the significance of the other variables in Table 3. For example,
in 2006, the only change was "town" becoming insignificant.
7. Although evidence suggests it has been increasing in the
United Kingdom, particularly since 2003.
