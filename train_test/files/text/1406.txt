Objective: This study examined the reported intake of foods and nutrients, and biomarkers of dietary exposure and
cardiovascular disease in relation to history of trying to lose weight.
Methods: Dietary, anthropometric and biochemical data were from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(1988 ­ 1994), n ¼ 13 092. The history of attempting weight loss variable was created as follows: trying to lose currently and
tried in the past 12 months (Y=Y); trying to lose currently, but not tried in the past 12 months (Y=N), not trying currently, but
tried in the past 12 months (N=Y); not trying now and not tried in the past 12 months (N=N). Multiple regression methods were
used to examine the independent association of history of trying to lose weight with reported intakes of energy, nutrients,
percentage energy from low-nutrient-dense foods (sweeteners, baked and dairy desserts, visible fats and salty snacks), and
serum concentrations of vitamins, carotenoids and lipids.
Results: Men and women in the Y=Y group reported lower energy intake relative to the N=N group (P < 0.0000). However, the
reported percentage energy from fat and carbohydrate by the Y=Y group did not differ from the N=N group. Percentage of
energy from low-nutrient-dense foods was lower in men in the Y=Y group but not women. The relative odds of reporting the
estimated average requirement (EAR) of folate, and vitamins A, B6
, B12
, C, E and iron and adequate intake (AI) of calcium were
not adversely affected by history of trying to lose weight in men. In women, the odds of meeting the folate and vitamin E EAR
were lower in the Y=Y group. Some history of weight loss categories were significant positive predictors of serum vitamin and
carotenoid concentrations, or unrelated to cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers.
Conclusions: There was little evidence for increased nutritional risk in those reporting repeat attempts at weight loss.

Introduction
With increasing prevalence of obesity around the globe, a
large proportion of individuals attempt to lose weight for
health or aesthetic reasons.1 ­ 3 Most attempts at weight loss
involve dietary modifications.3 However, the success rates of
maintaining the reduced body weight are disappointingly
low and individuals make repeated attempts to control their
weight.1 This phenomena of repeated attempts at weight loss
using dietary means has been described as `yo-yo dieting',
and is thought to be linked to weight variability or weight
cycling.4 ­ 6 The evidence linking weight cycling to adverse
health outcome, metabolic changes and risk of subsequent
major weight gain has been the subject of several recent
studies and reviews.4 ­ 9
Despite the interest in this issue, little is known about the
reported dietary practices and nutritional health of indivi-
duals making repeated attempts to lose weight. Some studies
have examined nutrient adequacy of diets reported by indi-
viduals trying to lose weight.10 To the author's knowledge,
however, nutritional status of those making repeated
attempts to lose weight has not been differentiated in these
studies. One may hypothesize that with repeated attempts at
energy restriction, intake and status of some nutrients may
be compromised. Alternatively, food selection may be favor-
ably affected with selection of an energy restricted but
nutrient-dense diet and thus possibly improve nutritional
profiles. Examining nutritional profiles in relation to

repeated attempts to lose weight will allow an evaluation of
nutritional consequences, if any, of such attempts.
The purpose of this study was to examine the reported
intake of foods and nutrients, and biomarkers of dietary
exposure and cardiovascular disease in relation to history
of trying to lose weight.
Methods
This study used data from the third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), 1988 ­ 1994.
The NHANES III is a multistage stratified probability
sample of the non-institutionalized, civilian US population,
aged 2 months and over.11 The survey was conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and included
administration of a questionnaire at home and a full medical
exam along with a battery of tests in a special mobile
examination center (MEC).11 Demographic and medical his-
tory information was obtained during the household inter-
view. The MEC exam included a physical and dental exam,
dietary interview, body measurements, and collection of
blood and urine samples. Body weight, height, and circum-
ference at various body sites were measured using standar-
dized procedures in the MEC.11 The MEC examination
response rate (weighted) was 73%.
History of trying to lose weight
During the household interview, respondents were asked,
`During the past 12 months, have you tried to lose weight?',
and at the MEC exam respondents were asked, `Are you
currently trying to lose weight?' By combining responses to
these questions, following categories of history of attempt-
ing weight loss were created: (1) yes, currently trying and yes,
tried in the last 12 months (Y=Y); (2) yes, currently trying but
not tried in the last 12 months (Y=N), (3) no, currently trying
and yes, tried in the last 12 months (N=Y); and (4) no,
currently trying and no, tried in the last 12 months (N=N).
Dietary assessment method
A 24 h dietary recall was collected by a trained dietary
interviewer in an MEC interview using an automated, micro-
computer-based interview and coding system.11 The type
and amount of foods consumed were recalled using recall
aids such as abstract food models, special charts, measuring
cups and rulers to help in quantifying the amounts
consumed. Special probes were used to help the recall of
commonly forgotten items such as condiments, accompani-
ments, fast foods and alcoholic beverages, etc.
Analytic sample
All adults aged 20 y and over were eligible for inclusion
(n ¼ 17 030) in this study. A complete and reliable dietary
recall (as determined by NCHS) was not available for 1051
respondents, leaving 15 979 eligible for inclusion. We further
excluded respondents stating that food intake on recalled
day was `much less' or `much more' than usual (n ¼ 2245),
women who were pregnant (n ¼ 282) or nursing (n ¼ 91),
those missing information on body weight (n ¼ 33) or
height (n ¼ 16), and those missing information on whether
currently trying to lose weight or whether they had tried to
lose weight in the past 12 months (n ¼ 308). The final
analytic sample (76% of the eligible) comprised 13 092
respondents (6295 men and 6797 women). Some respon-
dents were in more than one exclusion category.
Assessment of intake of low-nutrient-dense foods
Because of the prevailing hypothesis about misreporting of
nutritional undesirables in relation to body weight, and
trying to lose weight, we were especially interested in exam-
ining the intake of low-nutrient-dense foods. To determine
the intake of low-nutrient-dense foods, it was necessary to
identify foods belonging to this category from those reported
in the 24 h dietary recall. As a first step, the 4265 foods
reported by adult survey respondents were classified as
belonging to one or more of the five major food groups
(dairy, fruit, grain, meat and vegetable) or the low-nutrient-
dense foods group using methods we have described pre-
viously.12,13 Briefly, the assignment of foods into the various
groups was dependent on their nutrient content and uses in
the diet. The dairy group included milk, yogurt, cheese and
butter milk but excluded butter, cream cheese and dairy
desserts. The fruit group included all fresh, frozen, dried
and canned fruit and fruit juices but excluded fruit drinks.
The grain group included all breads, cereals, pastas and rice,
but excluded pastries. The meat group included meat, poul-
try, fish, eggs and meat alternates such as dried beans, nuts
and seeds. The vegetable group included all raw or cooked
fresh, frozen, and canned vegetables and juices. Mixed dishes
containing foods from several groups were grouped into all
the relevant groups. Foods excluded from these major food
groups were grouped into the low-nutrient-dense foods
group. The low-nutrient-dense foods were further placed
into five subgroups as follows: (1) visible fat -- butter, oil,
dressings and gravies, etc.; (2) sweeteners -- sugar, syrup,
candy, carbonated and non-carbonated sweetened drinks,
etc.; (3) baked and dairy desserts -- cookies, cakes, pies,
pastries, ice cream, puddings and cheese cakes, etc.; (4)
salted snacks -- potato, corn and tortilla chips, etc., and
lastly; (5) miscellaneous -- coffee, tea, condiments, spices,
etc.
The NHANES III nutrient database for individual foods,
which is derived from the US Department of Agriculture's
Survey Nutrient Data base,14 was used for determining
energy and nutrient content of all foods. The nutrients
examined included: vitamins A, E, B6
, B12
, folate and C,
and the minerals iron and calcium. The intake of each
nutrient was compared to the respective age ­ sex-specific
standard available. The standards used were 1989 Recom-

, folate,
and the minerals iron and calcium.15 ­ 19
As an estimate of dietary misreporting, a ratio of reported
energy intake (EI) to energy expenditure for basal needs
(BEE) was computed. BEE was estimated using age-sex-
weight specific equations according to Schofield.20
Data on serum vitamin C, folate, carotenoids and lipids
were obtained from the NCHS public release compact
disc.21,22 The methods used for measurement of these
serum analytes and their associated errors have been
described.21,22 Serum folate, ascorbate and the carote-
noids -- a-carotene, b-carotene, b-cryptoxanthin, lutein=
zeaxanthin and lycopene -- were chosen because the dietary
intake of these nutrients are believed to be major determi-
nants of serum concentrations of the respective nutrient and
can thus serve as biomarkers of dietary exposure.17,18 Serum
lipids are known to be adversely affected by body mass index
(BMI),23 and weight loss is usually recommended to improve
the serum lipid profile, hence we wished to examine their
relationship with history of attempted weight loss.
Statistical analyses
The mean daily energy, percentage energy from macronu-
trients, percentage energy from low-nutrient-dense foods
groups (separately and combined), mean percentage of the
population meeting the RDA or DRI of selected nutrients,
mean serum concentration of selected vitamers and analytes,
adjusted for multiple covariates, were obtained by categories
of history of trying to lose weight variable, separately for
men and women. All covariates for inclusion in the various
multiple regression models were decided a priori based on
known relationships of trying to lose weight related variables
with dietary, sociodemographic, lifestyle and biological vari-
ables. The estimates of nutrient and food group intake were

(vitamin C and carotenoids only), and alcohol intake (HDL-
cholesterol only), serum triglycerides and cholesterol (serum
carotenoids and vitamin E only). The procedure used for
obtaining covariate-adjusted estimates and standard errors
from survey data is based on Taylor Linearization methods
according to Graubard and Korn.24 All statistical analyses
were performed using SAS,25 and software designed for
analysis of survey data (SUDAAN).26 This software generates
variance estimates that are corrected for multi-stage stratified
probability design of complex surveys. Sample weights pro-
vided by the NCHS to correct for differential probabilities of
selection, non-coverage and non-response were used in all
analyses to obtain point estimates.11
The independent association of history of trying to lose
weight with food and nutrient intake, and serum analyte
concentration was examined using regression procedures to
adjust for multiple covariates mentioned above. Linear
regression procedures were used when the outcome variables
were continuous (eg dietary nutrient intake or serum nutri-
ent concentration). For categorical outcomes such as
whether or not the standard of a nutrient intake was met,
we used logistic regression procedures. In these regression
models, history of trying to lose weight was entered as a
categorical variable with the N=N as the reference category.
Results
Sociodemographic profile
Table 1 presents the sociodemographic profile of respondents
by categories of history of trying to lose weight questions.
More of those in the Y=Y category were women, non-Hispa-
nic white, and had > 12 y education. Over 88% of those in
the Y=Y category considered themselves overweight, and
96% wanted to weigh less.
Energy and macronutrient intake
Table 2 lists the adjusted meanÆ s.e. of intake of energy and
percentage energy from macronutrients, by categories of
history of trying to lose weight, by sex. Reported energy
intake was lower in men in the Y=Y and Y=N categories, and
in women in the Y=Y and N=Y categories relative to the N=N
category. In men, percentage energy from fat, saturated fat,
carbohydrate, or alcohol did not differ among the history of
weight loss categories. In women, percentage energy from
total and saturated fat were lower in the Y=N group relative
to the N=N group. Percentage energy from protein was
slightly but significantly higher in the Y=Y group relative
to the N=N group in both men and women. In women,
percentage energy from alcohol was higher in the Y=Y and

(energy density) of all foods and beverages reported was
lower in men in the Y=Y and N=Y groups and in women in
the Y=Y and Y=N groups.
Intake of low-nutrient-dense foods
Table 3 presents the adjusted meanÆ s.e. of the percentage
energy from all low-nutrient-dense foods and subgroups, by
categories of history of trying to lose weight, by sex. In men,
percentage energy from all low-nutrient-dense foods com-
bined, sweeteners and desserts was lower in the Y=Y group
relative to the N=N group. In women, relative to the N=N
group, the percentage energy from desserts was lower in the
Y=N group and percentage energy from sweeteners was lower
in the Y=Y group.
Odds of meeting the recommended level of intake of fat,
protein and micronutrients
Table 4 presents the adjusted percentageÆ s.e. of the popula-
tion reporting the recommended amounts of macro and
micronutrients by categories of history of trying to lose
weight, by sex. Men in the Y=Y group were more likely to
report consuming all five food groups in the recall. The
relative odds of reporting 30% energy from fat were
higher in women in the Y=Y and Y=N groups. The odds of
meeting the protein RDA were lower in most trying to lose
weight groups in both men and women. Men in the N=Y
group were more likely to meet the folate DRI. In women,
the relative odds of meeting the folate and vitamin E DRIs
were lower in the Y=Y group, and odds of meeting the
vitamin C DRI were lower in N=Y group.
In men, nutrient density (nutrient intake=1000 kcal) for
protein, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, folate, vitamin B6
and calcium was significantly higher (P 0.02) in the Y=Y
group relative to the N=N group. In women, the reported
nutrient density for protein, vitamin E, and calcium was
higher (P < 0.04) in the Y=Y group relative to the N=N group.

Dietary reporting and weight-loss attempts

Discussion
Reported mean energy intakes by all groups with history of
trying to lose weight were less than those without a history,
however, those making repeat attempt at weight loss (Y=Y)
reported the lowest energy intake of all groups. Despite these
differences in energy intake, the magnitude of differences in
the macronutrient distribution of energy intake among the
various history of weight loss categories were small. Percen-
tage energy from dietary fat in repeaters did not differ from
the N=N group, thus providing little support for the notion
that repeat dieters may show increased preference for dietary
fat.27 The reported intakes of energy and percentage energy
from fat by all history of weight loss groups were markedly
higher than those estimated from a food frequency ques-
tionnaire for men and women considered to be successful at
weight maintenance.28,29
Men in the Y=Y group reported lower energy density for
all foods and beverages, smaller amount of all foods and
beverages, as well as a lower percentage of energy from all
low-nutrient-dense foods and the low-nutrient-dense sub-
groups -- desserts and sweeteners. Similar trends were noted
in women, but reached statistical significance only for
reported energy density of foods. These observations are in
the expected direction for dietary strategies recommended
for decreasing energy intake. Increased physical activity is
also a recommended adjunct to achieving weight loss.23 A
slightly higher proportion of those in the Y=Y category
reported recreational physical activity. However, it should
be noted that both energy intake and physical activity are
subject to reporting bias (see discussion below).
In men, although mean energy intake in all history of
weight loss categories was lower, the odds of meeting the
standard of intake of key micronutrients were not adversely
affected; men repeat attempters were more likely to report
consuming all five food groups and consequently a higher
nutrient density for most examined micronutrients. Others
have also found diets of those trying to lose weight to be
generally adequate in micronutrients.10 Accordingly, serum
vitamin and carotenoid concentrations in men repeating
attempts at weight loss were generally higher relative to
the N=N group. Although women repeat attempters had
lower odds of meeting the folate and vitamin E standards,
the serum concentrations of folate and vitamin E were not
lower in these women. Similarly, cardiovascular risk biomar-
kers examined (serum total and LDL cholesterol, and homo-
cysteine concentrations) were not higher in repeat
attempters.
Overall gender differences in the study results are note-
worthy. Generally, men making repeat attempts at weight
loss reported more nutrient-dense diets than women,
whereas, in women, the dietary patterns reported by the
Y=N group were better relative to other weight loss groups.
This conclusion is also supported by the biochemical data --
RBC folate, serum ascorbate, vitamin E, and all carotenoid
(except lycopene) concentrations were higher in men in the
Y=Y group relative to the N=N group; in women, the highest
mean serum concentration of nutrients was more often
associated with the Y=N group.
Some limitations of this cross-sectional study should be
considered in interpreting the results. At least some over-
weight individuals may have responded affirmatively to
trying to lose weight at the time of the survey and in the
past because of the social desirability bias. Thus overweight
subjects may be more likely to be misclassified into history of
trying to lose weight categories. The result of this misclassi-
fication will be to attenuate the magnitude of differences
among history of trying to lose weight groups. Some indivi-
duals may not have used dietary modification while trying to
lose weight, but are nonetheless grouped into trying to lose
weight categories, also resulting in the attenuation of differ-
ences among groups. We note, however, that recent survey
data suggests that nearly 90% of those trying to lose weight
modified their diet.4 No information on the strategies
employed for achieving weight loss, as well as the duration
or the efficacy of these attempts was available, thus limiting
the applicability of results of this study. No adjustments were
made for multiple comparisons made in this study, it may
thus be preferable to pay attention to the magnitude of
differences among groups rather than P-values.
All methods of dietary assessment including the 24 h
recall used in this study are prone to a number of measure-
ment errors.30 These measurement errors may contribute to
an attenuation of significant associations between dietary
exposure and outcomes such as biomarkers. It is noteworthy
that in this study dietary intakes of vitamin C, folate,
vitamin E and carotenoids related positively with serum
concentrations of the respective nutrients, thus validating
dietary data. The 24 h recall method is generally considered
unsuitable for describing nutrient intakes of individuals, but
is useful for describing intakes of groups.30 Therefore, in this
study, the conclusions about nutrient intake are described as
differences among history of weight loss categories. Never-
theless, dietary measurement errors are possibly present and
may have contributed to the inability to find significant
differences among groups.
Dietary misreporting is one of the major sources of mea-
surement errors.30 ­ 32 BMI and dieting history are believed to
be negative correlates of dietary energy reporting.33,34 In this
study, the EI=BEE ratio adjusted for BMI and other potential
correlates was lower in all groups attempting weight loss.
Arguably, a lower EI=BEE ratio is consistent with attaining
negative energy balance in those attempting weight loss.
However, to what extent the reported energy intake repre-
sents actual intake cannot be ascertained without indepen-
dent validation of food intake. Therefore, the possibility of
under-reporting of food intake in relation to reported history
of trying to lose weight remains a consideration. Another
related issue is whether those with history of weight loss are

more likely to selectively under-report low-nutrient-density
foods. In this study, the reported proportion of energy from
many of the low-nutrient-density food groups was lower in
some history of weight loss categories in both men and
women. It is impossible to discern from the present study
whether this represents differential under-reporting of such
foods by those trying to lose weight or actual intake. Given
the bias in reporting of dietary intake, the examination of
biomarkers in relation to history of weight loss attempts is a
strength of the present study.
In conclusion, the results provide little evidence for
increased nutritional risk in those reporting repeat
attempts at weight loss. Conversely, higher serum concen-
tration of key vitamins and carotenoids in those making
repeat weight loss attempts suggests improved nutritional
profiles. There is a need for evaluation of biomarkers and
repeated assessment of diet from prospective studies focusing
on weight cycling.
