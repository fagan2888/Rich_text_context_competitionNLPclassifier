Background
Little is known about the factors associated with hypertension
awareness, treatment, and control.We examined the association of
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, risk factors, health
care access and utilization, and hypertension awareness, treatment,
and control.
Methods
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
1999­2004, a continuous, annual survey of the civilian non-
institutionalized US population.The sample comprised 4,816
hypertensive persons aged 20+ years.
Results
Adults 60 years were more likely to have uncontrolled hypertension
compared with adults 40­59 years old (60­69 years old: odds ratio
(OR) 1.69, confidence interval (CI) 1.31­2.17; 80+ years old: OR 3.56,
CI 2.42­5.25, respectively). Compared to men, women were more
likely to have uncontrolled hypertension (OR 1.29, CI 1.01­1.64).
When compared with non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks
were more likely to have uncontrolled hypertension (OR 1.40, CI
1.10­1.79). Diabetes and Poverty Income Ratio (PIR) classification
of <1 were associated with increased likelihood of uncontrolled
hypertension (OR 2.69, CI 1.99­3.63; OR 1.68, CI 1.19­2.37;
respectively). Persons without health insurance had higher
odds of being untreated when compared with insured persons
(OR 2.38, CI 1.71­3.32).Younger age (20­39 years), lack of risk
factors for hypertension and less health care were associated
with increased odds of being unaware of hypertension.
Conclusions
Uncontrolled hypertension is more likely among women, older
persons (60 years), non-Hispanic blacks, the poor, and diabetics.
Hypertension awareness and treatment is lower among the young
(20­39 years), the uninsured, individuals reporting fewer health risk
factors, and adults with less exposure and utilization of health care.

High blood pressure (BP) is a modifiable risk factor for cardio-
vascular disease (CVD).1 High BP increases the risk of heart
attack, heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease.2­4 Conversely,
lower BP levels are associated with increased longevity and
decreased morbidity.5­6 Hypertension control and awareness
rates have been shown to be associated with age, gender, race/
ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, access to and utilization of
health care, and risk factors associated with hypertension such
as diabetes and CVD, smoking, and overweight and obesity.7­12
In addition to individual characteristics, other factors may be
associated with hypertension control.13­16
The objective of this analysis was to examine the association of
gender, age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic indicators, risk fac-
tors including family history of CVD, health care utilization and
access and hypertension awareness, treatment, and control.
Methods
Survey description. The National Health and Nutrition

Exam
ination Survey (NHANES) is a national survey of the

civilian non-institutionalized US population.17 In 1999,
NHANES became a continuous survey. Annual samples
are selected using a complex, stratified, multistage prob-
ability 
sampling method and the data are released in 2-year
cycles.17 This report is based on 6 years of data collection
(1999­2004).
Survey participants were interviewed in their homes and
examined in mobile examination centers. Descriptions of the
sample design and data collection methods are available at the
NHANES website.18 The National Center for Health Statistics
Ethics Review Board approved all survey protocols. Informed
consent was obtained from all participants and persons who
were examined received remuneration.
Sample. A total of 20,228 people 20 years and older were
sampled. Of these, 15,332 (76%) were interviewed and 14,213
(70%) were also examined. As many as 755 persons did not
have BP data, yielding a final analytic sample of 13,458. The
sample included 4,816 hypertensive individuals.

Outcome. Hypertension and hypertension categories.
Hypertension status was based on mean BP derived from up
to three separate BP measurements that were obtained during
a single examination. BP was measured at the mobile exami-
nation center by physicians who followed a standardized pro-
tocol.18­20 Three hypertension outcomes were defined as (i)
the proportion of all hypertensives who were unaware, (ii) the
proportion of aware hypertensives who were untreated, and
(iii) the proportion of treated hypertensives whose hyperten-
sion was uncontrolled. See Table 1 for detailed definitions of
outcome measures.
Demographic characteristics. Self-reported age, race/
ethnicity,
education attainment, and income were included in the analy-
sis.18 Age was categorized into four groups: 20­39, 40­59,
60­79, and 80 years and older. Three race/ethnicity groups
were compared: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and
Mexican American. Data for the "other races" group, including
persons who reported "multiple races" and "other Hispanic"
persons were included in the total sample results but are not
reported separately. Education attainment was categorized
as: less than high school, high school/General Educational
Development, and more than high school education. Income
status was based on the PIR, an index of family income that
accounts for family size. Families that have PIR values below
1.00 have incomes that are below the official poverty thresh-
old and PIR values of 1.00 are above the poverty level (U.S.
Census Bureau 2003).
Other covariates. Height in centimeters and weight in kilo-
grams were measured using a standardized protocol. Three
body mass index (BMI) groups were formed using the cri-
teria established by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute, National Institutes of Health: normal weight (BMI
18.5­24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0­29.9), and obese (BMI 
30kg/m2).21 Responses to the medical conditions section of
the NHANES household interview were used to establish

history of risk 
factors.18 A participant was defined as "dia-
betic" if they reported they had ever been told by a doctor
that they had diabetes. History of CVD was ascertained by
responses to questions about congestive heart failure, coro-
nary heart disease, angina, heart attack, or stroke. The num-
ber of CVD conditions for each individual was summed and
values ranged from zero to three or more conditions reported.
Family history of hypertension, stroke, heart attack, or angina
was obtained from the family health history questions (mul-
tiple choice questions).
Health insurance availability was established using informa-
tion from the health insurance section of the NHANES family
questionnaire. The number of health care visits in the last year
was based on responses to the Health Utilization question-
naire section. The time since a BP reading was taken by a health
professional was based on the responses to a question in the
BP questionnaire section. Smoking status was ascertained by
responses to the smoking section of the household questionnaire
and participants were classified as never, former, and current
smokers. Smokers were defined as persons who had smoked
at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and were currently
smoking.18
Statistical analyses. SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)
was used for data management and SUDAAN (RTI, Research
Triangle Park, NC) was used for data analysis.
All analyses used the sample design weights for the examined
sample, which account for unequal probabilities of selection
and person-level non-response, and include poststratification
adjustment to the estimated US population. The recommended
method to derive 6-year examination sample weights was used.17
A Taylor series linearization method in SUDAAN was used to
calculate s.e. and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Prevalences
for each of the hypertension outcomes were computed for each
covariate. Statistical testing was performed using paired t-tests
with an  level of <0.05 set as significant level.
Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated using
logistic regression models for all of the outcomes. The independ-
ent associations of each covariate with the dependent variables
were determined. ORs having a 95% CI not including unity were
considered statistically significant.
Results
Table 2 presents the selected characteristics of individuals classi-
fied as hypertensives who were unaware, aware and not treated,
and treated but uncontrolled.
Among the unaware hypertensives a smaller percentage of
women were unaware when compared with men (P < 0.05).
Compared with reference (40­59 years), a greater propor-
tion of individuals aged 20­39 years were unaware (P < 0.01)
and less so adults aged 80 years and older (P < 0.05). Mexican
Americans had the highest proportion of unawareness (P <
0.01) whereas non-Hispanic blacks had the lowest proportion
of unawareness when compared with non-Hispanic whites (P <
0.05). Individuals classified as overweight or obese had a lower
percentage of unawareness compared with individuals classified

availability, health care visits, last BP reading) had a higher per-
centage of unawareness compared with individuals with more
access and utilization of care (Table 2). Compared with indi-
viduals who currently smoke, former smokers had a lower per-
centage of unawareness (P < 0.05).
Among the aware and untreated, a smaller percentage of
women were untreated when compared with men (P < 0.05).
Compared with adults aged 40­59 years, individuals aged
20­39 years had a higher percentage of untreated (P < 0.01),
whereas adults aged 60­79 years and aged 80 years and older had
a lower percentage of untreated (P < 0.01). A greater proportion
of Mexican Americans were aware and not treated compared
with non-Hispanic whites (P < 0.01). Individuals with a history
of risk factors had a lower percentage of untreated compared
with individuals with no such history (Table 2). Individuals
with a family history of hypertension or stroke had a lower per-
centage of untreated when compared with individuals with no
such family history (P < 0.01). Less access to and utilization of
health care (health insurance availability, health care visits, last
BP reading) were associated with a greater percentage of indi-
viduals untreated when compared with individuals with more
access and utilization (Table 2). Compared with individuals who
currently smoke, individuals who never smoked (P < 0.05) or
formerly smoked (P < 0.01) had a lower percentage of not being
treated (P < 0.01).
Hypertension control was lower among treated women
when compared with men (P < 0.01). Compared with adults
aged 40­59 years, individuals aged 60­79 years and 80 years
and older had a lower percentage of hypertension control when
treated (P < 0.01). Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks
had the highest percentage of uncontrolled yet treated when
compared with non-Hispanic whites (P < 0.01). Less than high
school education compared with more than high school educa-
tion and PIR < 4 compared with a PIR > 4 were all associated
with greater 
percentage of uncontrolled hypertension (Table 2).
Self-reported diabetics and individuals with a history of a stroke
had a higher percentage of uncontrolled hypertension when
compared with individuals with no such history. In contrast,
individuals with a family history of heart attack or angina had a
lower percentage of uncontrolled hypertension when compared
with individuals with no such history. Compared with current
smokers, individuals categorized as never smoked or formerly
smoked had a higher percentage of uncontrolled hypertension
despite being treated (Table 2).
The adjusted ORs and CI for the three logistic regression mod-
els are presented in Table 3.
A number of covariates were significantly (P < 0.05) asso-
ciated with the likelihood of being unaware of hypertension,
specifically. Individuals aged 20­39 years were more likely to be
unaware when compared with the reference group. Compared
with non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks were less likely
to be unaware of their hypertension. Compared with individuals
with a BMI < 25, individuals with a greater BMI were less likely
to be unaware of their hypertension. Compared with reference,
self-reported diabetics, those with a family history of hyperten-
sion or stroke, and the frequency of reporting CVD conditions
were associated with less likelihood of unawareness (Table 3).
Persons who reported fewer healthcare visits were more likely
to be unaware of their hypertension when compared with refer-
ence (10 visits) as were individuals who had not had their BP
measured in the past 6 months.
A number of covariates were significantly (P < 0.05) associ-
ated with the likelihood of not being treated yet aware of being
hypertensive, specifically. Individuals aged 20­39 years were
more likely to be untreated when compared with individuals
40­59 years old. In contrast, older individuals were less likely
to be untreated when compared to reference. Compared with
individuals with a BMI < 25, individuals with greater BMI were
less likely to be untreated. Compared to reference, self-reported
diabetics, those with a family history of hypertension or stroke,
and reporting one CV condition were associated with less likely
to be untreated (Table 3). Persons without health insurance were

2­3 health care visits were more likely to be untreated compared
with persons reporting 10 or more health care visits. Persons
who had not had a BP measurement within the past 6 months
were more likely to be untreated compared with persons who
had BP measured <6 months ago.
A number of covariates were significantly (P < 0.05) associ-
ated with hypertension control among the treated hypertensives,
specifically. Women, individuals aged 60 years and older, and
non-Hispanic blacks were less likely to control their hyper-
tension when compared with reference (Table 3). The likeli-
hood of uncontrolled hypertension was higher for individuals
in the 
lowest income PIR <1 when compared with PIR > 4.
Self-reported diabetics were more likely to have uncontrolled
hypertension. Compared with individuals who had 10 or more
health care visits, individuals with less health care visits (two to
three) were more likely than not to control their hypertension.
Individuals who never smoked were more likely to have uncon-
trolled hypertension compared with individuals who reported
smoking currently.
Discussion
Women had less control of their hypertension when compared
with men after adjusting for other covariates. Aside from bio-
logical factors, some current research has shown that physicians
surveyed downgraded significantly the cardiovascular risk status
of women compared with men, and were less likely to suggest
preventative measures for women than men.22­23
Despite Medicare availability for persons 65 years and older,
treated hypertensive persons aged 60­79 years were 70% more
likely to have uncontrolled hypertension than 40­59 year olds.
Moreover, individuals aged 80 years and older were more than
three times likely to have uncontrolled hypertension than
40­59 year olds. Hajjar et al. surveyed a national sample of phy-
sicians involved in geriatric care regarding geriatric hyperten-
sion management. Fifty-eight percent of those surveyed stated
that they would not start pharmacological therapy if systolic BP
were >140mmHg in patients 85 years or older.24­28
Previous reports suggested that Mexican Americans were
more unaware of hypertension when compared with non-

Hispanic whites.8,29 Similar results were obtained in our analysis
when excluding family history of hypertension or stroke (OR
1.46, CI 1.02­2.07). However, after including family history of
hypertension in the model, this significance did not hold (see
Table 3). Okonofua et al. reported that Hispanics were more
likely to perceive aging and stress as main factors contribut-
ing to hypertension and were less likely to agree that life style
changes such as decreased weight, alcohol and tobacco use are
related to hypertension.12 It is possible that Mexican Americans
view hypertension differently than non-Hispanic blacks and
non-Hispanic whites and therefore be less aware of it. However,
when a family member has hypertension individual awareness
may become more sensitized to the diagnosis of hypertension.
Parenthetically, 29% of Mexican Americans reported a family
history of hypertension or stroke.
Non-Hispanic blacks were less likely to have controlled
hypertension when treated compared with non-Hispanic
whites. Other population-based studies have reported similar
results.10­11 Howard et al. suggested three potential reasons
for these findings.12 First, there may be racial differences in
the aggressiveness of hypertension treatment or the quality
of follow-up once treated. Second, genetics or lifestyle factors
may alter the response to pharmacological treatments. Third, it
is possible that blacks find the side effects associated with the
treatment of hypertension unacceptable. Finally, there may be
unidentified confounders that we have not identified that may
explain the differences in hypertension control.
Although self-reported diabetics were less likely to be unaware
and untreated, they were significantly less likely to control their
hypertension. This finding is a cause for concern, considering
the synergy of diabetes and hypertension with incidence of CVD
and stroke.3 We used a more stringent definition of hyperten-
sion control in diabetics, recommended by JNC 7.3 Using the
definition of BP control (BP < 140/90mmHg) resulted in non-
significant outcome (OR 1.04, CI 0.82­1.33). The prevalence
of diagnosed diabetes has increased significantly over the last
decade adding urgency to the need to improve BP control in
diabetics.30­31
Our data suggest that the relationship between increased age
and weight, individual risk factors, and family risk factors and
hypertension are well understood by health care providers and
the public. In contrast, younger adults and individuals with no
history of risk factors may be erroneously secured in believing
that hypertension cannot be their problem. Similar findings were
reported by Asch et al.32
A number of variables directly addressed health availability
and utilization. After adjusting for all other covariates individu-
als with no health insurance were two times more likely to be
untreated for hypertension. Likewise, not having BP measured
in the past 6 months was associated with being unaware and
untreated. Also, the number of healthcare visits was associated
with lack of awareness. Poverty level maybe related to utiliza-
tion of health care as individuals with low income were 68% less
likely to have controlled hypertension.
The limitations of this analysis include the fact that the cross-
sectional design provides a one-time assessment of BP and the
hypertension status of some individuals may be misclassified.
Second, self-reported interview data were used and the accu-
racy of the information cannot be verified and may constitute a
source of error. Third, our definition of hypertension treatment
only included medication use. Alternative treatment modalities
such as diet and exercise were not examined. However, ~70%
of the individuals reported dieting or exercising besides taking
medications.
In general, the independent characteristics of individuals
who are unaware, not treated yet aware, and uncontrolled while
treated are similar yet different. The unaware individuals may
have one of the following characteristics: likely to be younger
(20­39 years), reporting little history of hypertension related
risk factors, normal weight (BMI < 25), and limited utilization
and exposure to health care. Similarly, individuals who are aware
but not treated may have one of the following characteristics:
younger (20­39 years), normal weight (BMI < 25), and have no

health insurance. Finally, individuals who are pharmacologi-
cally treated but not controlled may have one of the following

characteristics: women, either old or very old, non-Hispanic
black, poor, have fewer health care visits, and never have smoked.
One goal of Healthy People 2010 is to achieve improved rates of
hypertension control. These results provide information that
may be used for targeted 
intervention efforts.33
