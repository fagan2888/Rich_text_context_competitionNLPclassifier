Aging Out Of Coverage:
Young Adults With
Special Health Needs
Expanding access to this population depends on the creation of
a new eligibility standard based on the urgency and expense of
a person's health need, not a person's employability.
by Eliot Fishman
ABSTRACT: Young adults with disabilities and chronic conditions have high
uninsurance rates, while Medicaid and Medicare are closed to many of them.
Federal legislation to allow states to offer Medicaid to employed persons with
disabilities has met with an unenthusiastic reaction thus far in the states, with
few using the Medicaid options and low enrollment levels even in those states.
Nevertheless, these Medicaid changes do move us toward a more basic solu-
tion: replacing employability with insurability and dependence on health inter-
ventions as the eligibility standards for public coverage for adults.
Alarge number of young american adults lack
health insurance: twelve million, or 30 percent of persons
ages nineteen to twenty-nine (twice the rate of uninsurance
among those ages thirty to sixty-four). Young workers dispropor-
tionately lack employer-sponsored insurance, and college-based in-
surance is rare among persons with low and moderate incomes.
Young adults, of course, tend to be healthy as a group. But for young
adults with disabilities or with chronic illnesses, the lack of health
insurance can be devastating.
Persons with disabilities and chronic conditions often have pri-
vate or public coverage as children. A large majority of parents of
adolescents have employer coverage, and the State Children's
Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) or Medicaid provides categori-
cal coverage for poor and near-poor children and for virtually all
foster children. However, turning nineteen, twenty, or twenty-one
can bring a treacherous transition from parental or public coverage.
In this paper I first present previously unpublished data on young
adults with disabilities and describe the insurance gaps among
young adults with serious chronic illnesses. I then discuss three
existing state policies--extensions of Children with Special Health

Care Needs" block grants to adults, regulation of private insurance,
and Medicaid options authorized in the late 1990s--which although
promising have helped only small numbers of people. Almost all of
these programs are tiny, short on outreach, and thus far grossly
inadequate to the problems that exist. Most states have not imple-
mented the new Medicaid options, and those that have imple-
mented them have largely failed to enroll people outside the cash
assistance system. Even if fully implemented, these expansions would
not reach many young adults with serious chronic conditions who
cannot get private insurance but who are not functionally disabled.
Nevertheless, the halting, incremental adjustments to Medicaid
eligibility described here have begun a move toward a more funda-
mental solution. The recent Medicaid options have the potential to
break the connection between public coverage and cash assistance
for persons with disabilities, just as it has been broken for children
through Medicaid changes in the past fifteen years. That so many
young persons with disabilities and chronic illnesses lack health
insurance points to the need to base adults' eligibility for public
coverage on the urgency of health needs and insurability, rather than
on lack of employability and receipt of income support. I conclude
with some ideas to move policy more firmly in that direction.
I Data and methods. There have been little analysis or few data
published on the insurance status of the young adults discussed
here. While the Survey on Income and Program Participation (SIPP)
and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) each include de-
tailed sets of questions on disability and insurance status, this paper
is the first to publish data on insurance coverage for those ages
nineteen to twenty-nine with varying levels of disability, using SIPP.
No similarly comprehensive and well-defined national survey data
are available for persons with chronic illnesses, but there is enough
information to indicate enormous gaps in coverage among persons
with acute health care needs. To examine the impact of previous
reforms in coverage policy, I have surveyed program administrators
in states that have used the new Medicaid options or have extended
Title V programs to adults.
Levels Of Uninsurance
I Young persons with disabilities. For younger adults (ages
19­29) with disabilities, insurance coverage is poor: Almost 22 per-
cent are uninsured, a proportion much larger than is the case for
similarly disabled children (age eighteen and younger) (Exhibit 1).
About 36 percent have public coverage, and 42 percent have private
insurance (Exhibit 2). The approximately 2.3 million young adults
with disabilities that are defined by the Bureau of the Census as

"severe"--substantial developmental or physical disabilities or
chronic mental illness--also had a high level of uninsurance (19.8
percent) but somewhat higher levels of public coverage.
When all working-age disabled adults (ages 18­64) are consid-
ered, the statistics are still disturbing. About 16 percent lack health
insurance (4.4 million persons), even though half of them are em-
ployed.! Of the 9.3 million adults with a long-term disability that
limits their ability to work, 15 percent (1.4 million) are uninsured.
Approximately 40 percent of these more severely disabled unin-
sured persons manage some employment." Adults with disabilities
who work but lack health insurance are mostly low income: 30
percent are poor, and 62 percent make less than 200 percent of the
federal poverty level.#

Children with disabilities fare better in terms of coverage than
their young adult counterparts do, in several ways. Private parental
coverage covers many more children than young adults because of
the limits on most family coverage policies. SCHIP covers children
only up to age nineteen. Medicaid has relatively generous coverage
of children: Most important, it covers all children in households
with incomes up to 100 percent of poverty (or much more in many
states). Moreover, in states offering coverage for "Katie Beckett"
children (the great majority of states), Medicaid covers community-
dwelling children meeting the Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
standard for disability regardless of parental income, if they are
receiving care that would be provided in an institution. But Medic-
aid coverage of adults with disabilities in almost all states is limited
to the SSI program and "medically needy" options. Finally, the SSI
disability standard for children is more liberal in certain respects
than that for adults--most explicitly, adults who earn more than
$700 a month are considered ineligible for SSI as a rule, regardless of
their medical expenses. In 1997 and 1998, 35­40 percent of eighteen-
year-olds with disabilities applying to continue their previous SSI
coverage were turned down; this likely led to the loss of Medicaid
coverage for some 35,000 young adults in those two years.$
I Young persons with chronic illnesses. Many children with
serious, chronic health conditions depend on Medicaid for their
health coverage. This is so both because poor and near-poor children
are disproportionately burdened with these conditions, and because
the high health expenditures these conditions impose can help fami-
lies to "spend down" to Medicaid eligibility in most states. Yet most
of these children will not qualify for Medicaid when they turn nine-
teen. The main path for such coverage, as discussed above, would be
SSI eligibility. But SSI focuses on employability and functional prob-
lems rather than serious health problems as such.
This is reflected in statistics on children enrolled in Medicaid--
even those with serious chronic conditions generally get Medicaid
because of their age rather than by qualifying for both Medicaid and
cash payments through SSI. The prevalence of severe, chronic health
conditions is three to five times higher among Medicaid-insured
than privately insured children.% These conditions include cancer,
cystic fibrosis, severe asthma, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection, and sickle-cell anemia. However, 74 percent of the chil-
dren in Medicaid who have a severe medical condition do not re-
ceive SSI, even under SSI's relatively generous eligibility rules for
children, and a similar majority of children in SSI have disabilities
that are not severe medical conditions.& SSI eligibility is typically
determined by level of functional loss or, in some cases, medical

severity, rather than the costs of medical treatment. A medical con-
dition may be under control and nondisabling yet very expensive to
treat.' A 1997 study of Medicaid-enrolled children in California,
New York, Georgia, and Michigan found that 2 percent had one of
these conditions but were not enrolled in SSI. If this proportion is
similar in other states, about 400,000 of the twenty million children
enrolled in Medicaid have a serious, chronic health condition but no
SSI. When these children turn nineteen, they are likely to have
enormous health costs with no Medicaid eligibility.
Shortfalls In Existing Coverage Policy
Except in a handful of states with broad Medicaid waivers, public
coverage for nonelderly adults is available only to very low-income
parents, to those receiving income support by reason of disability
from either Social Security or SSI, or to some of those who gain
employment after having received income support for their disabil-
ity. The regulatory definition of disability includes a substantial list
of serious illnesses, but the illness must be sufficiently advanced to
constitute a work disability. The provision of publicly financed
health insurance to persons with disabilities and serious illnesses,
then, has traditionally been based upon unemployability. Three ar-
eas of policy that have seen some efforts to change that traditional
standard are Medicaid reforms; adult add-ons to Title V programs;
and regulation of private coverage. None has had much of an impact
thus far.
I Medicare and Medicaid eligibility and enrollment. Three
million persons with disabilities ages eighteen to sixty-four received
Medicare in 1995. People receiving Social Security checks and their
dependents are eligible for Medicare coverage, including those eligi-
ble for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), although SSDI
recipients must wait two years before their Medicare eligibility
kicks in. Adults with disabilities under age sixty-five can only get
Medicare through SSDI if they have an employment history but are
now disabled, or if they are the dependent child of a Social Security
beneficiary. They also must be severely disabled under Social Secu-
rity rules, meaning that they are not able to work and earn signifi-
cant income. Nevertheless, former Medicare beneficiaries who begin
working can get free Medicare coverage for eight and a half years
after returning to work; after that they can take advantage of a
buy-in option created by the new Ticket to Work legislation.
Medicaid is the public alternative for the larger number of young
adults with disabilities who cannot qualify for Medicare because
they never worked and do not have retired parents. About 4.9 mil-
lion persons with disabilities ages eighteen to sixty-four are in

Medicaid. (Of these Medicaid beneficiaries, 800,000 receive Medi-
care as well, meaning that there were 7.1 million disabled Medicaid
and Medicare beneficiaries ages eighteen to sixty-four in 1995.)
They can qualify for Medicaid through SSI if they make less than
$700 per month in earned income after subtracting certain ex-
penses, along with some other income and asset restrictions.
Once qualified for SSI, young adults can retain Medicaid coverage
even if they get a job and earn a modest income: Under rules in place
since 1980, Medicaid coverage must continue for employed former
SSI recipients if their income is below state-specific limits. In 2000
this provision allowed 83,000 persons with disabilities to receive
Medicaid after their income disqualified them for SSI; 25,000 were
age twenty-nine or younger.!
In a small number of states, adults with disabilities with higher
incomes can in principle qualify without ever having been on SSI
through two new, optional Medicaid eligibility categories. One pro-
vision, passed in 1997, allows states to give Medicaid coverage to
employed persons with disabilities earning up to 250 percent of
poverty who meet the other SSI eligibility standards because of the
severity of their impairment." A second optional Medicaid exten-
sion, another piece of 1999's Ticket to Work law, extends the 1997
law to become completely open-ended, allowing states to offer
Medicaid to anyone disabled enough for SSI at whatever income the
state chooses. States can even extend coverage to those working
persons with disabilities whose conditions have improved medi-
cally to the point that their severe impairment no longer meets the
SSI standard. The law only loosely restricts cost sharing and premi-
ums. As of August 2001 only fifteen states had implemented one of
these optional Medicaid extensions.
Even in the states that have implemented these two optional
Medicaid provisions, programs have so far mainly helped those com-
ing off the SSI rolls--that is, those who find jobs after they had been
deemed unemployable and thereby gained SSI or SSDI eligibility.
Partial figures show that almost all of the enrollees in the new pro-
grams had already qualified for Medicaid and SSI before they started
working (Exhibit 3). All states with information on enrollees indi-
cate that almost all of them were prior Medicaid beneficiaries, and
few have incomes high enough to trigger cost-sharing requirements.
This is largely true of those states that have achieved relatively high
initial enrollments, with the partial exception of Minnesota. These
states have adopted these Medicaid expansions as welfare-to-work
supports for SSI beneficiaries rather than as health insurance expan-
sions.

hibitive for persons with serious health problems.# For young adults
aging out of their parents' private coverage, there are in principle
several options aside from the unregulated individual insurance
market and Medicaid or other public programs: coverage in a family
plan that covers dependent adult children with disabilities (once a
rare level of family coverage but one now mandated for plans not
subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA,
in forty-four states); coverage in a family plan as a full-time student;
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) cover-
age (typically limited to thirty-six months for children aging out of
coverage); state high-risk pools or community-rated markets; and
gaining a "certificate of portability" into an employer or individual
plan based on the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPAA) of 1996, for those applying immediately after having
been covered by a different plan for eighteen months.
None of these paths to private coverage offers help to the vast
majority of uninsured young persons with disabilities or chronic
illnesses. Dependent coverage for disabled adults in family health

plans, including coverage now mandated in most states, almost al-
ways requires the dependent to be unemployable, as does SSI. In-
deed, previous SSI enrollment is one of the primary sources of docu-
mentation that insurers use to determine initial eligibility. Student
dependent coverage usually ends in the early twenties and requires
a full-time course load that persons with disabilities and chronic
illnesses often cannot maintain, and persons from low-income fami-
lies often cannot afford. The other three options--COBRA, high-
risk pools and community-rated markets, and HIPAA portability
certificates--all involve high premiums, because of adverse selec-
tion and the lack of employer subsidy. Moreover, the uninsured with
disabilities and chronic illnesses are a predominantly low-income
population, with 62 percent of the uninsured with serious disabili-
ties making less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, an
income that is not much more than the premium for a community-
rated policy. Uninsured young adults, if anything, have even lower
incomes.
I Condition-specific Title V program extensions. Twenty-one
states operate condition-specific coverage programs for adults with
one or more genetic diseases. These are primarily programs for chil-
dren that use federal Title V block-grant funding (state programs
dating back to "Crippled Children's" programs in the 1920s and
1930s) that states have extended to adults, generally using state
funds. But while most of those programs cover a substantial number
of children with a wide variety of conditions, adult enrollment is
typically limited to those who have one or one of two specific condi-
tions, and it may be limited as well to those who were enrolled in the
program as a child (because they were ineligible for Medicaid) or to
those using specific providers and medical centers (Exhibit 4). Most
of these program extensions are quite small. Because Title V is a
block-grant program, moreover, expansions of Title V programs are
almost always with state-only funds, while Medicaid receives an
open-ended federal match of 50­80 percent. If states are going to
expand eligibility, it is more likely to be through Medicaid.
A New Standard For Public Coverage?
Substantial employment with significant income generally keeps
persons with disabilities and chronic illnesses from gaining eligibil-
ity for Medicare and Medicaid, since the disability standard is de-
fined around inability to work. That keeps many people uninsured
and also a large number unemployed: The 1994 Harris Survey of
Americans with Disabilities found that 31 percent of those who are
unemployed find loss of health insurance or long-term services to be
a work barrier.$

So far, the most promising avenue toward shifting away from the
employability standard--Medicaid options aimed at employed per-
sons with disabilities--has had disappointing results even in states
that have adopted it. These states appear to be uncertain what
standards to use to enroll working people with disabilities into
Medicaid. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS,
formerly HCFA) has clearly stated that enrollees need not go
through the SSI/SSDI disability determination process. The CMS
has added, however, that states should enroll those who would be
eligible for SSI except for the fact that they are working. Yet three of
the five steps in determining eligibility for SSI have to do with
unemployment and the inability to work. The CMS, then, has in-
structed the states to make Medicaid available to working people
based on standards that are supposed to indicate an inability to
work. A Connecticut program administrator stated that he has in-
structed enrollment officers to use the following broad standard:
"People who work through extraordinary efforts even though their
disability is substantial enough that they would be justified in not
working and collecting SSI are eligible." In practice, this apparently
has meant enrolling recent SSI beneficiaries.
While the fact that these programs have been enrolling straight
out of the SSI rolls sidesteps the problem of disability determina-
tion, it also greatly limits the reach of the federal legislation. The
very existence of this definitional problem, however, derives from a
more fundamental problem in American health policy, the same
fundamental problem that leaves so many young people with dis-
abilities and chronic conditions uninsured: Employability does not
mean insurability. The unemployability standard is a legacy of
Medicaid's connection to welfare. But the employer health coverage
system often excludes bad health risks, persons with low incomes,
and persons in part-time jobs--all characteristics typical of the

More specifically, the unemployability standard excludes two
groups of people who cannot access private insurance. First, it ex-
cludes persons with functional disabilities who can work, but can-
not work in a full-time job that offers them coverage. Second, it
excludes persons with chronic conditions and illnesses that are ex-
pensive to treat but do not limit or only partly limit their ability to
work. Legal, social, and medical advances have allowed more per-
sons with disabilities and chronic medical conditions to work. But
because of their disability or health condition, their work will often
be part time and may not offer benefits, particularly for young per-
sons in entry-level jobs. Also, the individual and small-employer
health insurance markets are inaccessible to persons with serious
health problems in ways that are difficult to address with market
regulation.
In principle, a loosening of the unemployability standard is all
that is needed to reach the first group--those with functional dis-
abilities who can and should work but whose disability is a strong
risk factor for lack of access to jobs with benefits. To reach persons
with chronic illnesses, however, focusing on employability is off
target: Their claim on public coverage stems from the urgency of
their health needs and their unattractiveness to private insurers.
These criteria ought to be the basis of a new eligibility standard,
although such a standard would need to balance the need to cover
the uninsurable against the risk of turning public coverage into an
all-purpose dumping ground for people who get sick.
Medicaid may be a poor vehicle to accomplish this change in
eligibility standards. Although Medicaid is a natural choice given its
current enrollment of persons with disabilities who are not former
workers, there is already substantial experience that many states
will refuse optional Medicaid expansions, particularly expansions
to expensive populations. And even if expansions are made manda-
tory, the means-tested, state-administered Medicaid model has had
trouble reaching employed people in many states, as evidenced by
underenrollment problems among mothers and children in recent
Medicaid expansions and SCHIP.
Both one-fifth of all young adults with disabilities
and one-fifth of those with severe disabilities are uninsured.
Close to half of uninsured persons with disabilities work. And
three-quarters of Medicaid-eligible children with a severe, chronic
health problem do not even have SSI and therefore in all likelihood
will also lose their Medicaid coverage when they turn nineteen.
Indeed, turning nineteen and getting a job often means losing eligi-

bility for SSI and Medicaid without a private-sector alternative. If
the problem of the young uninsured adult with special health needs
is to be addressed, eligibility for adults with disabilities must move
from an unemployability standard to an "acuity and insurability"
standard, based both on employability at a job with benefits and on
the urgency and expense of individuals' health needs.
