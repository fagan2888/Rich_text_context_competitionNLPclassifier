the publicly-posted data file that accompanied our origi-
nal 2013 publication in PLOS Medicine, Mortality in Iraq

findings.
Van Weezel and Spagat's complaints center on five
issues, which we address in turn.
1. Conflating violent deaths with non-violent deaths in
making excess-death calculations. The concern is
that such estimates "can create an illusion that a war
is indirectly causing nonviolent deaths even for a
war that causes exclusively violent deaths."
2. Incorrectly ignoring the impact of stratification on
both their central estimates and uncertainty
intervals.
3. Failing to use correct statistical technique: "All of
the uncertainly intervals are obtained through boot-
strapping although the dataset has only 100 clusters
which is not enough to be sanguine about using
asymptotic theory; thus, the reader should regard all
UI's in the paper as too narrow, a point which makes
death claims even less credible."
4. Not discounting deaths when a certificate was not
available: "Interviewers recorded seeing only 284
of 385 reported deaths in the dataset; 32 said they
do not possess a death certificate and 66 claim to
have a death certificate but failed to produce the
supposed death certificate when prompted."
5. Over-estimating the effects of migration on sup-
pressing mortality: "Hagopian et al argue there is a

Abstract
Stijn van Weezel and Michael Spagat (2017) have critiqued our 2011 report of mortality in Iraq following the 2003
US-led invasion in this issue of Research & Politics. In this response, we make our case for reporting both direct and
indirect excess war-related deaths (while distinguishing the difference), defend our efforts to account for survival bias,
and provide evidence for including all household-reported deaths, not just those cases where a death certificate can be
demonstrated. We also point out Van Weezel and Spagat's misunderstanding of our sample selection method, despite
our citation of our separate paper that thoroughly describes our approach.

which there were, they say, approximately 56
000
deaths. They then add 56000 to 406000 and round
up to 500000."
Additional Note: We did not provide governorate names
in the data set, as part of an assurance to our institutional
review board (IRB) that we would do our utmost to protect
the identity of subjects. Releasing the governorate names,
especially the small ones, might have compromised that
ethical pledge. For this project, our University of
Washington IRB review was extremely time consuming
and unusually thorough. Therefore, we do not respond to
Spagat's data processing appendix where he guesses gover-
norate identity.
Conflating violent deaths with non-
violent deaths in making excess-death
calculations
Our primary interest is in excess mortality because
our question is about the elusive scientific unicorn: cau-
sality of death. Excess mortality is only the crudest
approximation of the human cost of war. There are many
effects of war: funds diverted from health, war-related
injuries, psychological distress, and damage done to
individuals and society. Our measurement of indirect
deaths is therefore a highly conservative estimate of true
the cost of war.
We are confused about the Van Weezel and Spagat cri-
tique on this question, however. While we believe indirect
deaths should be included in the total mortality estimates,
our paper does account for violent and nonviolent deaths
separately. Our paper states specifically and explicitly, "We
estimate that more than 60% of excess deaths were directly
attributable to violence, with the rest associated with the
collapse of infrastructure and other indirect, but war-
related, causes."
Further, Figure 5 clearly distinguishes between violent
and non-violent war-related deaths. The caption reads,
"The counterfactual (had there been no war) estimate shows
the predicted death counts if crude death rates had remained
at their average level from 2001­2002 during the war and
occupation (in gray). War-related, but not violent, deaths
above the normal baseline are in the salmon-colored area.
War-related violent deaths are portrayed in red."
In addition, our text reports, Cardiovascular condi-
tions were the main cause of nonviolent death, accounting
for 47% of nonviolent deaths over the entire study period
(n = 146). Other common sources of nonviolent deaths
included chronic illnesses (11%, n = 35), infant or child-
hood deaths other than injuries (12.4%, n = 38), non-war
injuries (11%, n = 33), and cancer (8%, n = 26). See
Figure 1 for the number of household deaths by year and
cause, 2001­2011.
Incorrectly ignoring the impact of
stratification
While Van Weezel and Spagat claim we incorrectly managed
stratification methodology, their concern is ill founded: our
method did not involve stratification at all. Instead, we used
gridded population data, a geographic information system,
and satellite imagery to select 100 "clusters" across Iraq. To
select the "starting households" in each cluster, we dropped a
small grid cell over the cluster's Google Earth image and
selected one cell (using random numbers); we then chose the
residential rooftop that most fully fit in that square to serve as
the start household. The sampling methods used in our work
were described in full in in The International Journal of
Health Geography in 2012.(Galway et al., 2012) Our method
eliminates the need for stratification during sample selection,
or sample weighting during the analysis stage.
We were early adopters of emerging data sources and
imagery in our sampling approaches. One of the main rea-
sons we used this approach was that the war had interrupted
the ability of the Iraqi Central Organization for Statistics and
Information Technology to compile accurate population data
(United Nations Department of Economic and SocialAffairs,
nd). Since 2011, other authors have developed and employed
similar approaches, also employing gridded population data
and satellite imagery (particularly in regions with poor cen-
sus data) (Lee et al., 2016; Thomson et al., 2012). The
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) has recommended
gridded population data as alternative sample frames in set-
tings where census data are not available, outdated and/or
known to be unreliable (ICF International, 2012; UNICEF,
2014). This is a growing area of research--one that will con-
tinue to be important for research in war torn and other low-
resource regions of the world.
Spagat has previously questioned the sampling methodol-
ogies of mortality reports, including casting doubt on sam-
pling technique in the 2004 and 2006 Lancet papers that
included some of the same authors as the University
Collaborative Iraq Mortality Study (Burnham et al., 2006;
Roberts et al., 2004). In that critique (Johnson et al., 2008),
Spagat et al. asserted a "Main Street Bias" in Iraq cluster sam-
pling that could have overestimated mortality. Despite their
misinterpretation of the sampling method in the 2006 Lancet
paper (as all samples were from residential streets), we devel-
oped an alternative sampling method for our 2011 study in
which primary sampling units were chosen with a probability
proportionate-to-estimated size method and starting house-
holds were selected randomly.
Confidence intervals are too narrow
given the bootstrapping method
employed
Van Weezel and Spagat asked that we incorporate the
effects of governorate stratification in our bootstrapping.
Hagopian et al. 3
Since we did not stratify by governorate (see above),
doing this will lead to incorrect results. Nonetheless, this
is an opportunity to further elaborate on our bootstrap
method choices.
As a sensitivity analysis that we did not include in the
publication, we considered a bootstrap that resampled both
clusters and households within clusters. Although resam-
pling by clusters is justified by basic nonparametric boot-
strap theory (Bradley Efron, personal communication), we
compared it with the more complicated nested bootstrap
advocated by Van Weezel and Spagat. This sensitivity
analysis found that the uncertainty interval was actually
smaller when using the more complex resampling proce-
dure, exactly the opposite of what Van Weezel and Spagat
predict. On the basis of this sensitivity analysis, we
included only the simpler approach in our paper, as this
approach is preferred by the theory and also produces more
conservative estimates, in the sense that the uncertainty
intervals are wider.
We are confident in our bootstrapping methods to calcu-
late confidence intervals, as they follow the suggested
approach recommended by the world expert of the method,
and produced wider intervals than the alternative approach.
Death certificates were not seen in
26% of cases
Van Weezel and Spagat claim death reports should be dis-
counted for households that could not produce a death cer-
tificate. The percentage of violent deaths reported by
households with death certificates available, however, did
not differ substantially from those without, which we
reported in our paper. Further, even if we include all cases
regardless of requiring certificates, we are likely to be
under-stating deaths. Siegler et al. found that households
under-reported, not over-reported, deaths due to intentional
violence (Siegler et al., 2008).
The insistence on death certificates is not supported
by standard demographic methods. Epidemiological
methods to estimate a variety of health problem through
household surveys have been developed over several
decades (Mills et al., 2008; Morris & Nguyen, 2008).
Typically, household surveyors record deaths based on
household respondent answers to standardized questions
(Corsi et al., 2012). This method is well established by
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). DHS have
been using household listing methods to record deaths
(as we did), since 1984; these have been found consist-
ently reliable. UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster
Surveys (Kumar et al., 2017; UNICEF, 2014) and other
national surveys use similar approaches. This method
was also used for the household survey portion of the
Iraq Family Health Survey (Iraq Family Health Survey
Study et al., 2008), which Spagat has not critiqued.
Further, national census data systems worldwide, which
gather birth and death information and estimate mortal-
ity rates, use household interview protocols that do not
include visible evidence of death certificates (United
Nations, 2004).
Deaths reported by households are accepted at face
value the world over for national census surveys. Health
studies tend to trust family members to report accurately.
Why would they not be? In calculating national immuni-
zation coverages, for example, UNICEF and ministry of
health surveyors routinely record both evidence from a
child's immunization card, and in the absence of a card,
accept the mother's history of the child receiving immuni-
zations. These results are used to estimate national immu-
nization coverage, and deemed to be nationally accurate
(UNICEF, 2014).
The situation with death certificates is analogous, and
serves to only reinforce the accuracy of household death
reporting. Because most households in Iraq secure a cer-
tificate at the time of death, we added this additional con-
firmatory step. When a certificate was reported to be
present in the household but was not accessible on short
notice, it was usually because the head of household or the
person who knew its location was absent. As we stated in
our paper, the percentage of households reporting deaths
that had death certificates, either shown or claimed (91%),
was very similar in the 2006 and 2011 studies, indicating
the availability of death certificates remained high
throughout the war.
Spagat has published extensively using the data of
Iraq Body Count, a passive media-based measure of
2003 Iraq war mortality (Hicks, Dardagan, Bagnall et
al., 2011; Hicks, Dardagan, Guerrero Serdan et al., 2011;
Hicks & Spagat, 2008). This method has been discred-
ited, however, as it understates mortality (Ahmed, 2015;
Burkle & Garfield, 2013; Carpenter et al., 2013; Siegler
et al., 2008). As evidence, an important finding in our
work is that small arms fire contributed substantially to
mortality (63%); these events rarely make the sort of
headlines tracked by the Iraq Body Count.
A 2008 study by Siegler et al., for example, attempted to
match deaths to the Body Count's media-based tally
(Siegler et al., 2008). Authors interviewed Baghdad resi-
dents (via telephone) to ask about the 10 violent deaths
closest to their homes since the war began. Interviewees
secured place, date, and mechanism for each death. Of
those who did not match, authors re-interviewed the origi-
nal respondents. Baghdad residents reported 161 deaths in
total, 39 of which (24%) were believed to be reflected in
press reports as summarized by the Body Count. An addi-
tional 13 deaths (8%) may have been in the database (dif-
ficult to tell from the details), but 61 (38%) were certainly
not in the database. More than a third (38%, N=61) of vio-
lent deaths had not gone to the morgue as required by law
for violent deaths, but were instead buried directly by the
family. This strongly suggests there could not be a death
4 Research and Politics 
certificate. Therefore, the study suggests a meaningful por-
tion of violent deaths between 2003 and 2007 did not have
death certificates. Spagat's insistence on a death certificate
would reduce the mortality measure by more than 200000
deaths by his estimates.
Migration adjustment overstates
mortality
Van Weezel and Spagat assert, "The authors reach beyond
their data to bridge the gap of nearly 100
000 deaths.
Specifically, they argue that there is a war refugee popula-
tion of approximately two million people not covered by
their survey from which there were, they say, approxi-
mately 56000 deaths.... 56000 deaths in a refugee popula-
tion of 2 million is well below the baseline rate of 2.89 per
1000 per year that Hagopian et al. (2013) use in their excess
death estimates."
As we stated in our paper:
There is evidence that the killings in Iraq were dispro-
portionately targeted towards the higher-income intelli-
gentsia, a group typically in a better position to migrate to
a safer setting if under attack [45]. We therefore reviewed
a number of secondary data sources to estimate the num-
ber of Iraqis who migrated out of the country over the
course of the war, to arrive at a total estimate of the miss-
ing households that left the country (and were therefore no
longer available in our sampling frame). We then divided
this total by an estimated household size, and multiplied
total households by the average fraction of deaths per
household [46] to estimate the total deaths our household
survey would have missed, and added this number to our
total death count.
We acknowledge two problems with our migration
adjustment, both likely to understate the real number of
deaths among migrants. First, refugee and IDP estimates are
probably artificially low, as a significant portion of refugees
do not register with the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees or the International Organization for Migration
(Burnham et al., nd). Second, we had available only one
estimate of the proportion of deaths among households who
migrated away, and that estimate reported only the number
of households with "one or more" deaths, not the total num-
ber or proportion of deaths.
As stated in our manuscript, our estimate is based on the
refugee household pre-migration death fraction from pre-
viously published literature (Doocy & Burnham, 2009). In
a 2009 report for the International Catholic Migration
Commission (ICMC), the Johns Hopkins Center for
Refugee and Disaster Response reported, [o]f households
arriving in 2003 or later, 87.6% reported that the house-
hold experienced one or more violent events prior to
departure from Iraq. Households from Baghdad were 2.1
(CI: 1.3- 3.4) times more likely to have experienced a vio-
lent event than those from other provinces. Frequencies of
reported violent events were as follows: threats (81.1%),
kidnapping of a household member (33.4%), destruction of
the family dwelling (20.2%), violent injury (17.3%), vio-
lent death of a household member (14.9%), imprisonment
(8.8%), and other violent events such as burglary or rob-
bery, assault, attempted kidnapping or murder, and torture
(12.9%). [our emphasis]
We used the Doocy estimate of Iraqi refugee households
experiencing at least one violent death, 14.9% (Doocy &
Burnham, 2009). Given the average household size of 5.34
in our study, we calculated total migrants would comprise
at least 374532 households. Conservatively assuming only
one death in each of the emigrant households, accounting
for those deaths among emigrant households added 55804
deaths [(2 million/5.34)*.149], which we rounded to 56000
so as to avoid a false sense of precision.
We did not use the death rate in our own data set (as a
substitute for the .149 per household figure) because it
was subject to survivor bias. Survivor bias is often thought
of as an epidemiological concept, but its relevance to
social research is wide. For example, in finance, survivor-
ship bias would arise when excluding failed companies
from performance studies because they no longer exist. It
often causes the results of studies to skew towards more
favorable results (fewer deaths, of companies or people)
because only those successful enough to survive until the
point of observation are included. For example, a mutual
fund analysis of holdings today will include only those
companies surviving until now. Losing funds that have
closed and merged into other funds can hide poor perfor-
mance. Since we hypothesized the migrating families
would have a higher death rate than those left behind, we
used an estimate that had been specifically calculated for
those who had migrated.
As for "rounding up" our death count, we again point to
the problem of false precision in stating an exact estimate.
We had many reasons to believe our estimates were too
low. For example, as Van Weezel and Spagat note, our
counter-factual (non-war) death rate was undoubtedly too
high (resulting in too-low war-related death estimates).
They wrote, "death rates tend to decrease over time so it
recommended projecting forward a decreasing death-rate
trend rather than a flat line frozen at a pre-war rate." We had
no data to support anything other than a flat line, however,
so we did not. This suppressed the mortality estimate.
Conclusion
Van Weezel and Spagat's points 1 (direct and indirect mor-
tality) and 5 (migration adjustment) represent opportunities
for science to improve. However, we conclude that the
three other arguments (stratification, confidence intervals,
and death certificates) are without merit.
Given the widespread and growing level of armed
conflict worldwide and the enormous amount of damage
Hagopian et al. 5
to health it produces, it should be a priority for public
health scientists to develop and refine methods of war
epidemiology. US science agencies would be well advised
to invest in this area (Hagopian, 2017).
Were such funding available for war epidemiology, the
top priorities for research would include improvements in
the following.
1. Methods for protecting field research teams, who
face significant threats.
2. Measures of survival bias in household survey sam-
pling, to account for migration and other factors.
3. Methods for sample selection.
4. Estimates of total population counts in both pre-war
and during or post-war populations.
5. Estimating the counter-factual non-war death rate,
given falling rates of death worldwide.
6. Assessing which non-violent deaths are most likely
to be war-related.
7. Measures of non-lethal effects of war that generate
short and long-term morbidity.
8. Health costs of diverting resources from spending
on social goods to fund war and militarism.
9. Public health prevention of war, and ways to reduce
its harms to health.
