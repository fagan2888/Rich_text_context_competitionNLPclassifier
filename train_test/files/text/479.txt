Abstract
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) provides the most comprehensive
assessment of the health and nutrition status of the US population. Up-to-date reference intervals on
biomarkers and dietary intake inform the scientific and public health policy communities on current status
and trends over time.
The main purpose of dietary assessment methods such as the food-frequency questionnaire, food record
(or diary), and 24-hr dietary recall is to estimate intake of nutrients and, together with supplement usage
information, describe total intake of various foods or nutrients. As with all self-reporting methods, these tools
are challenging to use and interpret. Yet, they are needed to establish dietary reference intake recommenda-
tions and to evaluate what proportion of the population meets these recommendations. While biomarkers are
generally expensive and, to some degree, invasive, there is no question as to their ability to assess nutrition
status. In some cases biomarkers can also be used to assess intake or function, although rarely can one
biomarker fulfill all these purposes. For example, serum folate is a good indicator of folate intake, red blood
cell (RBC) folate is a good status indicator, and plasma total homocysteine is a good functional indicator
of one-carbon metabolism.
Using folate and vitamin D Á two vitamins that are currently hotly debated in the public health arena Á as
two case studies, we discuss the complexities of using biomarkers and total intake information to assess
nutrition status. These two examples also show how biomarkers and intake provide different information and
how both are needed to evaluate and set public health policy. We also provide guidance on general
requirements for using nutrition biomarkers and food and supplement intake information in longitudinal,
population-based surveys.

Clinical research studies, randomized clinical trials,
and population-based surveys or surveillance
systems provide valuable information to research
as well as public health policy community in their
ongoing discussion on the importance of vitamins in
health outcomes. Public health policy and intervention
programs rely on these sources of information. One
critical set of surveillance information needed is the
nutrition status of the population, at present and in
the past. The National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) is planned and conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
and its primary objective is to assess the health and
nutrition status of adults and children in the United
States (1). NHANES is the most significant population-
based survey to provide questionnaire, examination, and
laboratory data to the scientific and public health policy

community on a variety of nutrition and health topics.
This US survey has evolved for the past 50 years, first as
targeted health surveys in the 1960s and then as periodic
surveys of health and nutrition from the early 1970s
to the middle 1990s. Since 1999, NHANES has been a
continuous survey conducted in 2-year cycles, covering
the entire age range of the civilian, non-institutionalized
US population. NHANES is unique in that it combines
home interviews with health tests performed in a Mobile
Examination Center (MEC), where biologic specimens
are also collected for biochemical analyses.
Measuring biomarkers and assessing food and supple-
ment intake are the two main tools used to assess
the vitamin status of a population. Because each tool
has advantages and disadvantages, frequently they are
performed together for better interpretation. Aside from
evaluating inadequate or excess vitamin intake levels and
the relation between vitamin status and health outcomes,
this information can potentially assist in the following
public health activities:
1. Establishing and improving existing population
reference intervals that physicians, clinicians, nutri-
tionists, scientists, and public health officials can use
to determine whether a person or a group of people
has an unusually high or low level of a biochemical
indicator or intake.
2. Determining whether the nutrition status of special
population groups such as minorities, children,
women of childbearing age, or the elderly is different
from that of other groups or whether it needs
improvement.
3. Tracking trends in the nutrition status of the
population.
4. Assessing the effectiveness of public health efforts to
improve the nutrition status of the population.
This article discusses the complexities of using bio-
markers and total intake information to assess nutrition
status and set and evaluate public health policy by using
folate and vitamin D as two case studies.
Methods and materials
Biochemical assessment to evaluate vitamin status in
NHANES
The main purpose of biochemical measurements is to
assess nutrition status generally as a sum of food in-
take, supplement use, bioavailability, metabolism, and
excretion. While field tests are available for some clinical
parameters such as hemoglobin or glucose, nutrition
biomarkers generally must be analyzed in the laboratory
using more complex biochemical assays based on analy-
tical principles such as chromatography, immunoassay,
or colorimetry. Because biomarkers are not self-reported,
they typically correctly reflect what we believe to be
the nutrition status. Although biomarkers can also be
used to directly assess intake or function, rarely can
one biomarker fulfill all of these purposes. Panels of
biomarkers are sometimes used for enhanced interpreta-
tion. Limitations of biomarkers include expensive proce-
dures and equipment and usually invasive sampling.
To obtain reliable results, laboratory methods must
undergo thorough validation and their quality must be
continuously assessed. One less-discussed concern is that
biochemical methods to assess nutrition status have
generally not been standardized, which leads to problems
with poorly comparable data among different assays and
laboratories.
In NHANES, blood is drawn and urine is collected
in the MEC; aliquots of these specimens are processed
in a controlled environment following standardized
protocols. Specimens are stored at Á208C at the MEC
until the end of the week when they are shipped on dry
ice to the testing laboratories. Early attempts to use
multiple laboratories per test for the nutrition biomarkers
in the Ten State Nutrition Survey (1968Á1969) to allow
for fast sample turn-around resulted in problems of
non-comparability of data. A central laboratory using
reference analytical methods was therefore established
in 1970 at the CDC for HANES I (1971Á1975) (2). This
allowed for consistent, coordinated, and high-quality
biomarker measurements. The concept of a central
laboratory Á at least for medium and high complexity
testing Á is still in place today.
The `National Report on Biochemical Indicators of
Diet and Nutrition in the US Population 1999Á2002' is
the most comprehensive and current source of reference
interval tables for 27 nutrition biomarkers in the US
population (3). The CDC's National Center for Environ-
mental Health (NCEH), plans to release periodic updates
of this report. The next report, scheduled to be released
in 2012, will cover reference data for !50 nutrition
biomarkers from NHANES 2003Á2006.
Dietary assessment to evaluate vitamin status in large
population surveys
The purpose of dietary assessment methods is to evaluate
intake of foods or nutrients and, combined with supple-
ment usage information, describe total intake of various
nutrients. The main assessment methods are food fre-
quency questionnaire (FFQ), 24-hr dietary recall and
the food record (or diary). All methods have strengths
and weaknesses; the method selected should be depen-
dent on the research question. These methods are
relatively easy and inexpensive (with the possible excep-
tion of the 24-hr recall) to conduct, and they have the
advantage of being non-invasive. Technologic advances
in tools (interviewer, computer, Internet, cell phone) as
well as data processing (manual, computer, specialized

software, personal digital assistants) have facilitated and
standardized the administration of these methods (4).
Three main FFQs are used Á Block, Willett, and the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Á and a comparative
validation has been conducted (5). The two commonly
used 24-hr recall interviewing systems are the University
of Minnesota's Nutrition Data System for Research (6)
and the USDA's Automated Multi-Pass Method (7). The
NCI is developing a computer-based, 24-hr recall inter-
viewing system that does not require specially trained
interviewers. However, as with all self-reporting methods,
these tools are challenging to use and interpret. The
process of recording intake influences diet and introduces
bias. Under-reporting is common, particularly for obese
persons (8) and can alter relationships with both bio-
markers and health outcomes. Typically, correlation
coefficients between nutrient intake and the biomarker
value are B0.5 (9, 10). Yet, even with these shortcomings,
information gained from dietary assessment methods
is vital in establishing guidelines for dietary reference
intakes and evaluating what proportion of the popula-
tion meets these recommendations and who the potential
groups of concern are.
Since 2002, NHANES collects two 24-hr dietary recalls
for every participant using the USDA's Automated
Multi-Pass Method. The first 24-hr recall is conducted
at the MEC; the second is conducted by telephone 3Á10
days later. Also since 2002, NHANES uses either small,
targeted FFQs or an NCI-developed FFQ (11). The
NHANES FFQ, formerly called Food Propensity Ques-
tionnaire, is mailed to all participants aged 2 and older
who completed at least one 24-hr recall. It collects much
of the same information as the Block or Willet FFQ
but does not ask about portion size, thereby minimizing
respondent burden. As suggested in the NHANES Diet-
ary Tutorial (12), the FFQ data were not intended to
be used directly for nutrient intake estimation, but rather
as covariates when estimating usual dietary intakes from
the 24-hr recalls. Generally, day-to-day variation in in-
take for an individual is greater than person-to-person
variation within a population. To avoid this excessive
intra-individual variation, which can lead to serious
problems in data interpretation, NCI has developed a
statistical modeling method to estimate usual dietary
intakes representing a more accurate average daily intake
of a nutrient or food and thereby being more reflective
of long-term exposure (13). It requires the availability of
data from one or more non-consecutive, 24-hr recalls or
food records for a representative sample of persons from
the population of interest.
`What We Eat in America' (WWEIA) is a report
containing data from the dietary intake interview com-
ponent of NHANES (14). It is an integration of two
nationwide surveys, the US Department of Agricul-
ture's (USDA) Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by
Individuals (CSFII) and NCHS's NHANES. The two
surveys were integrated in 2002. NCHS is responsible for
sample design and data collection; USDA is responsible
for dietary data-collection methods, maintenance of the
databases used to code and process the data, and data
review and processing. The USDA Food and Nutrient
Databases for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) is a resource
that is used to code dietary intakes and to calculate
nutrients for WWEIA (15). The FNDDS is based on
nutrient values in the USDA National Nutrient Database
for Standard Reference, the most recent release of which
is SR23 (16). For each NHANES 2-year data release
cycle, WWEIA generates two dietary intake data files.
The individual foods file contains one record per food
for each survey participant for each 24-hr dietary recall.
It provides information on the estimated nutrient con-
sumption, when and where the food was eaten, and
the amount of food eaten. The total nutrient intakes file
contains one record per day for each survey participant
for each 24-hr dietary recall. It provides information on
daily totals of food energy and nutrient intakes, daily
intake of water, and whether the intake was typical for
the participant.
To assess supplement usage in NHANES, the inter-
viewer completes a household dietary supplement ques-
tionnaire with information provided by the participant.
This questionnaire captures dietary supplement use over
the past 30 days, listing the name and type of the
supplement, frequency of use, duration of use, and amount
taken. Since 2007, during the MEC visit, the participant
has been asked about supplement use on the previous
day; this information can be matched with the 24-hr
dietary recall. An average daily intake of dietary supple-
ments can be calculated from the information collected
at the home of the participant.
Results and discussion
Case study one Á assessment of folate status in NHANES
In 1996, the FDA mandated that enriched grain products
be fortified with folic acid (140 mg per 100 g) to reduce
the risk of neural-tube defects (NTD) in newborns (17).
This regulation became effective January 1998. Folic acid
fortification provides an excellent account of the various
pieces of information that were needed to implement
such a public health policy (18). To establish the need
for folic acid fortification, a determination had to be
made that: (1) the total folate intake (foods and supple-
ments) was low, (2) the prevalence of folate deficiency as
assessed through biomarkers was high, (3) a significant
number of folate-preventable NTDs were present, and
(4) alternative strategies to increase folate intake were
not promising. Benefits and risks of fortification had
to be weighed. The folic acid fortification amount had to
be determined through modeling by identifying target

foods for fortification, assessing the frequency and
amounts of the target foods consumed by various
population groups, and using dose-response information
from intervention trials to estimate the expected increase
in biologic response.
NHANES has monitored folate status through bio-
chemical measurements and dietary intake assessment
both pre- and post-fortification and has therefore been
an excellent tool to assess the impact of the US folic
acid fortification program.
Biochemical assessment of folate status
Serum folate, red blood cell (RBC) folate, and plasma
total homocysteine (tHcy) are the three most commonly
used biochemical indicators to assess folate status (19).
Serum folate is indicative of recent folate intake and
short-term status, while RBC folate better indicates folate
stores and long-term status. Plasma tHcy is responsive to
changes in folate intake, but it is mainly considered a
good functional indicator of B-vitamin status; plasma
tHcy is elevated as a result of low folate, vitamin B2, B6,
and/or B12 levels.
Measurements of serum and RBC folate levels among
a full set of participants were part of NHANES III
(1988Á1994) as well as of each survey cycle since the
introduction of the continuous NHANES survey in 1999
(20). The same BioRad Quanta Phase II radioassay was
used from 1991 to 2006 for both matrices. An earlier
version of the assay, the Quanta Phase I radioassay,
was used from 1988 to 1991; however, the data were
adjusted for the method differences between the two
assays prior to release (21).
Measurements of plasma tHcy levels by the Abbott
fluorescence polarization immunoassay among a full
set of participants were part of NHANES 1999Á2004
(22). Because optimally prepared EDTA plasma was not
available during NHANES III, tHcy levels were analyzed
by HPLC in surplus serum from phase II of NHANES
III (1991Á1994) (23). Method-comparison studies to
assess the change in matrix and methods were conducted
and discussed elsewhere (22, 24).
Before implementing folate fortification, FDA intake
modeling estimated that consumers with low folate intake
would increase their folate intake by 80Á100 mg per day
(25). Short-term folic acid supplementation trials showed
that serum folate levels increased by approximately
20Á30% in response to a 100 mg per day increase in folic
acid intake (26). No information was available on the
magnitude of changes in serum folate levels as a result
of continuous daily exposure to folic acid from fortified
food products. By applying the same laboratory method
(BioRad radioassay) Á held to strict quality assurance
requirements to ensure comparability of data over time Á
to post-fortification blood samples as had been used
with pre-fortification samples, we showed that folate
status has greatly improved in the entire US population
as well as in the target group of women of childbearing
age (27). Serum folate levels stabilized between 1999
and 2006 (20) (Fig. 1). The increase in serum folate levels
from pre- to post-fortification was however, much larger
than expected from short-term folic acid supplementation
trials Á they nearly tripled. This demonstrates the value
of biomonitoring; it reflects the net effect of many
uncertainties surrounding public health decisions such
as fortification (i.e. under-reporting of foods consumed,
increased consumer selection of folate-rich foods because
of health claims, and increasing availability of the
numbers and types of folate-fortified, non-standardized
foods).
Short-term folic acid supplementation trials showed
that RBC folate levels increased by Â10% in response
to a 100 mg per day increase in folic acid intake (28). In
pre- to post-fortification NHANES, RBC folate levels
increased much more than expected from short-term folic
acid supplementation trials Á they nearly doubled
(27). The prevalence of low RBC folate levels in women
of childbearing age decreased from Â40% pre-fortifica-
tion to Â5% post-fortification and stabilized between
1999 and 2006 (19) (Fig. 2).
As would be expected from the inverse relationship
between folate and tHcy, elevated tHcy levels have
decreased from pre- to post-fortification in older men
(]60 years) from 30 to 15% and in older women from
20 to 10% (22).
In 2007, the manufacturer discontinued the BioRad
folate radioassay. Because continued monitoring of folate
status through NHANES was still necessary, the tradi-
tional microbiologic growth assay (MA) using Lactoba-
cillus casei Á used by some countries in their national
nutrition surveys for population monitoring Á was
selected to measure folate levels in serum and RBCs in
the US population for 2007 and thereafter. More recently,
after input from a 2010 roundtable of folate experts,
CDC decided that liquid chromatography coupled to

tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) should be used
to continue monitoring serum folate for NHANES 2011
and thereafter. This assay measures individual folate
forms, in particular, unmetabolized folic acid, which is
under investigation for potential health effects because it
is not a physiological form of folate.
Total intake assessment of folate status
The various sources of folate intake are foods (which
contain mainly reduced folate forms), fortified foods
such as enriched grain products and ready-to-eat cereals
(which contain added folic acid in addition to natural
reduced folate forms), and dietary supplements (which
contain folic acid only). Due to the increased bioavail-
ability of folic acid compared with food folate, one
dietary folate equivalent (DFE) has been defined as
equivalent to 1 mg of food folate, 0.6 mg of folic acid
from fortified food, 0.6 mg of folic acid from a supplement
taken with food, or 0.5 mg of folic acid on an empty
stomach (19).
The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of DFEs
for adult men and women is 400 mg per day, while the
estimated average requirement (EAR) of DFEs is 320 mg
per day (18). The tolerable upper intake level (UL) for
adults is set at 1,000 mg per day of folate from fortified
food or as a supplement (i.e. folic acid), exclusive of
food folate (19). To reduce the risk of NTDs among
newborns, the Public Health Service recommends that
women capable of becoming pregnant take 400 mg of folic
acid daily from fortified foods, supplements, or both, in
addition to consuming food folate from a varied diet (29).
A study was conducted (30) to assess changes in folate
total intake from pre- (1988Á1994) to post-fortification
(1999Á2000) in NHANES. The study found that after
fortification, the category `bread, rolls, and crackers'
became the single largest contributor of total folate to
the American diet (15.6% of total intake), surpassing
vegetables, which were the number one folate food source
before fortification. The population's mean total folate
intake increased by 28% from 275 mg to 351 mg per day.
However, at the time, the dietary folate data in the
NHANES nutrient database were reported as total folate
intake (food folate'folic acid from fortification) in
micrograms per day not as DFE and intake was, there-
fore, underestimated.
Another report (31) assessed post-fortification (2001Á
2002) total folic acid intake in women of childbearing age.
The study found that no race/ethnic group consumed the
400 mg of folic acid daily from fortified food, supple-
ments, or both as recommended by the Public Health
Service for women capable of becoming pregnant (29).
The average estimated daily total folic acid intake was
221 mg; however, this represents an underestimation of
Â10% because a second 24-hr dietary recall was not
available in NHANES 2001Á2002 to calculate usual
intakes.
A study was conducted (32) to assess post-fortification
(2003Á2006) total folate and folic acid intake in the entire
population in a data set where two 24-hr dietary recalls
were available and usual intakes were calculated. While
the average total folate intakes (diet'supplements) for
various age groups of adults 19 years and older were
quite high (645Á900 DFE for women and 774Á938 DFE
for men), 13Á17% of women and 3.6Á6.3% of men
had a folate intake below the EAR. A large portion of
the total folate intake was provided by diet only (includ-
ing fortified foods): 454Á470 DFE for women and 558Á
653 DFE for men. The average total folic acid intakes
(diet'supplements) were 274Á407 mg for women and
317Á421 mg for men; 2.2Á5.2% of women and 2.1Á5.0%
of men exceeded the UL for adults.
A recent report (33) assessed the post-fortification
(2003Á2006) source of folic acid intake and the propor-
tion of the entire population that exceeded the UL.
The study found that 2.7% of the total US popula-
tion exceeded the UL for folic acid. Some participants
exceeded the UL, but only if the source of folic acid
was supplements in addition to enriched grain products
and ready-to-eat cereals (5.5 and 9.4%, respectively). Of
the supplement users, Â1% exceeded the UL if the
supplement amount was 5400 mg per day, while 48%
exceeded the UL if the amount of supplement was !400
mg per day.
Summary of biochemical and dietary assessment of folate
status
The NHANES blood-biomarker levels have responded
as expected Á serum and RBC folate have increased and
plasma tHcy has decreased Á but the magnitude of change
was larger than anticipated from small-scale intervention
studies. Dietary intake levels of folic acid and total folate
have also responded as expected Á they have increased
in response to folic acid fortification. However, folate
intake is still below the EAR for a small portion of

Biomarkers and dietary intake to assess vitamin status

the population, and women of childbearing age still
do not consume, on average, the recommended 400 mg
of folic acid daily. Only a small fraction of adults who
consume supplements exceed the UL of folic acid. One
issue in examining the relationship between biomarker
data and dietary assessment data is that they sometimes
reflect differential time periods. For example, we adjust
the nutrient intakes reported in the 24-hr recall to reflect
long-term exposure and, therefore, they may be more
comparable to status assessed by RBC folate than by
serum folate. The folate case study also shows how
each data source, biomarkers, and questionnaires, pro-
vides valuable information on its own. Public health
officials need both types of information Á in addition
to knowing how NTD rates have changed over time Á
to judge whether fortification has achieved the desired
impact in the group of interest without exposing other
population groups to excessive amounts of folic acid.
Biomarker levels of folate status are associated with
a number of health outcomes beyond NTDs Á from
anemia to various chronic disease conditions Á that are
currently under investigation. The ability to integrate
intake information with biomarker information in a
large population survey such as NHANES opens the
door to exploratory research and hypothesis generation
for future targeted nutrition and health studies.
Case study two Á assessment of vitamin D status in
NHANES
Vitamin D is one of the most talked about nutrients
today in the United States as well as worldwide. In recent
years, low vitamin D blood levels have been associated
with increased risk for numerous health outcomes beyond
risk for rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.
Some of these health outcomes include various cancers,
cardiovascular disease, autoimmune conditions (such as
multiple sclerosis), dementia, diabetes, and glucose intol-
erance (34). At the same time, excessive amounts of
vitamin D in blood can become toxic and produce a
variety of health problems (35). Therefore, both excessive
and deficient levels of vitamin D are important. While
there is no unanimity with respect to vitamin D and
various health outcomes, we have an obvious need to
know the vitamin D status of the US population and
whether it has changed over time. It is also important to
know how much of the population's diet is contributing
to vitamin D status, what foods provide the most vitamin
D to the population, and whether dietary supplements
provide a significant amount of vitamin D to the
population taking them. Finally, the scientific and public
policy community need to know how much vitamin D
we need and how much is too much. NHANES has
been providing answers to some of these questions since
NHANES III, although much needed improvements in
the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard
Reference of foods containing vitamin D (36) were only
recently made available with SR22. NHANES does
not provide direct information about participants' sun
exposure, which catalyzes cutaneous synthesis of vitamin
D. As endogenously synthesized vitamin D3 is a sig-
nificant source for most persons, this unusual informa-
tion gap makes biomarker measurements even more
important to assess the vitamin D status of the US
population.
Biochemical assessment of vitamin D status
Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are
generally considered the best indicator of vitamin D
status (35). The DiaSorin radioassay was used to assess
25(OH)D in NHANES III (1988Á1994) and in the
continuous NHANES starting in 2000 through the
2005Á2006 survey cycle (37). However, the manufacturer
introduced an assay reformulation in the late 1990s that
required us to bridge the gap between data obtained
by using two versions of the assay to allow the interpreta-
tion of trends over time (37). Specifically, the change
from the original to the reformulated assay produced
25(OH)D results that were on average 12% lower (38).

which the original DiaSorin assay was used, than in
NHANES 2003Á2004 (white bars), in which the refor-
mulated assay was used (Fig. 3, Panel A). When the
NHANES III values were adjusted for the change in assay,
the difference in age-standardized means between surveys
was reduced by 10.3Á11.2 nmol/L, depending on sex
(Fig. 3, Panel B). This means that a large portion of
the previous difference between these two surveys was
attributable to changes from the original to the reformu-
lated assay and not to the real difference in population
levels of 25(OH)D. A smaller portion of the previous
difference between these two surveys was attributable to
altered behavior, specifically an increase in body mass
index, decrease in sun exposure, or decrease in milk
consumption (data not shown) (38).
Due to some shortcomings of the immunoassay
methodology for measuring 25(OH)D, after input from
a roundtable of vitamin D experts, CDC decided that LC-
MS/MS should be used for NHANES 2007 and there-
after (37). This assay measures the individual 25(OH)D
forms and has been standardized to the higher-order
reference methodology developed by the National In-
stitute of Standards and Technology.
A second important issue with vitamin D is that
the experts disagree on the most appropriate 25(OH)D
cutpoint for optimal health (39). Since 1997, the cutpoint
of B27.5 nmol/L has been used in the United States to
define deficiency status for vitamin D (35). This cutpoint
was associated with increased risk of rickets and osteo-
malacia. In recent years, other cutpoints (i.e. 50 nmol/L
and 80 nmol/L) have been proposed by members of the
research community as more appropriate for `inadequate'
or `at risk' levels, especially for other public health
concerns or diseases. The 2010 IOM report (40) reeval-
uated the evidence for cutpoints and concluded that
25(OH)D B30 nmol/L and 30Á50 nmol/L places indivi-
duals at risk for deficiency and inadequacy, respectively.
The prevalence of deficiency at the cutpoint of 27.5
nmol/L, a value that is close to 30 nmol/L, is B6% for all
population age groups in NHANES 2000Á2004 (Fig. 4)
(39). The cutpoint of 50 nmol/L produces combined
prevalences of vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy of
Â30% for the various population age groups. Differences
among race/ethnic groups in the prevalence of low levels
of serum 25(OH)D have also been found, but the
meaning of these differences is unclear (39). African
Americans have reduced rates of fracture and osteoporo-
sis compared with Whites despite reduced cutaneous
synthesis of vitamin D and lower 25(OH)D levels
throughout life (40).
Total intake assessment of vitamin D status
With respect to vitamin D intake from foods and dietary
supplements, the primary questions are: `Is intake
adequate?' and `What are the groups of concern?' Based
on the 2010 IOM report (40), the new RDA for vitamin
D is 600 international units (IU) for those between 1 and
70 years of age. The RDA for those !70 years is 800 IU.
The EAR for vitamin D is 400 IU per day for persons
1 year and older and adequate intake (AI) is 400 IU
per day for infants. For pregnant and lactating women,
the EAR is 400 IU per day. The UL for those 9 years
and older is 4,000 IU per day, those 4Á8 years 3,000 IU
per day, those 1Á3 years 2,500 IU per day, those 7Á12
months 2,500 IU per day, and those 0Á6 months 1,000 IU
per day.
Based on an analysis of vitamin D intake data from
NHANES 2005Á2006 (foods alone and foods plus dietary
supplements) using the 1997 IOM guidelines, much of the
adult US population is not meeting the recommended
adequate intake for vitamin D (40). This is especially the
case for men !50 years (Fig. 5). In those age groups,
only 24Á36% meet the old AI recommendations and
dietary supplements are a significant source of vitamin D
intake, accounting for Â80% of the intake in those 51Á70
years and nearly all of the intake in those older than
70 years. For females, with the exception of 14- to
18-year-old women, the pattern for total intake is similar

Biomarkers and dietary intake to assess vitamin status

to that for males (data not shown) (40). Fewer than
one-third of women 14Á18 years and ]71 years have
adequate intakes based on the older guidelines. For
women aged ]14 years, dietary supplements contribute
significantly to total vitamin D intake. Comparing the
1997 AI and 2010 EAR recommendations as they
apply to populations, recommendations have doubled
for all groups except those 51Á70 years for whom the
recommendation is the same (400 IU for AI or EAR) and
those !70 years for whom the recommendation has
decreased (1997: 600 IU AI vs 2010: 400 IU EAR).
Thus, the percentage of persons meeting the new intake
recommendations are expected to be lower in younger
age groups and higher in those !70 years. However,
when setting these recommendations, the IOM pointed
out that reported intakes are expected to be under-
estimations of actual intakes (40).
Summary of biochemical and total intake assessment of
vitamin D status
NHANES is a valuable source of information on vitamin
D. Based on the previous IOM criteria, about 50%
of adults, but fewer than one-third of older people,
meet the recommended AI for vitamin D based on total
intake. A new analysis is needed to assess what propor-
tion of the population meets the currently recommended
IOM intake criteria. Less than 10% of the US population
have 25(OH)D levels that are generally considered
deficient. The IOM evaluated the correlation of serum
levels with inadequacy and the congruence of the data
support 25(OH)D levels below 30 nmol/L with undesir-
able bone health outcomes (39); however, methodologic
issues contribute uncertainty to this cutoff. The two
ways to assess vitamin D status in the US population
through intake and blood levels are not leading to the
same conclusion. This is partially expected because sun
exposure can be a significant contributor to vitamin
D status and circulating 25(OH)D levels in addition
to intake. These challenges in interpretation show how
important it is to have access to both intake and
biomarker data. Furthermore, the vitamin D case study
shows the impact of methodologic issues, i.e. reformula-
tions in laboratory methods, on the interpretation of
trends in status over time.
Conclusions
The following is guidance on general requirements for
monitoring nutrition status in large population studies
and is derived from decades of NHANES experience.
1. The imprecision of the intake assessment method
or biomarker assay should be low enough to enable
detection of small trends. Due to the relatively
large sample size of NHANES, small changes in
population means can be easily detected. Fluctua-
tions in the mean as a result of an imprecise assay
can be mistaken for changes in population values.
2. The robustness of the intake assessment method
or biomarker assay should be high enough to
ensure comparability of data over time. As noted
previously, fluctuations of the assay can be mistaken
for changes in population values.
3. Development of a comprehensive and accurate
food-composition database is key to assessment of
dietary intake in the US population in NHANES.
Lack of a complete and reliable database hindered
dietary intake studies, including those needed to set
dietary reference intakes.
4. Improvements in web-based software are needed
to enable automated and self-administered 24-hr
dietary recalls to be cost-effectively employed multi-
ple times.
5. Use of one laboratory per test and preferably a
central laboratory for the medium and high com-
plexity testing helps to ensure consistent quality and
comparability of data over time.
6. Use of kit biomarker assays for longitudinal studies
may be problematic. To provide valid results, kit
assays must be performed exactly as prescribed by the
manufacturer, which rules out alteration of condi-
tions to troubleshoot problems or improve the assay.
Furthermore, re-calibration or refinement of the
assay by the manufacturer cannot be ruled out and
makes interpretation of long-term trends difficult.
7. Laboratory-developed biomarker tests are preferred,
particularly when the measurement of the analyte
has not yet been standardized, to allow in-house
control over assay calibration and troubleshooting.
8. Whenever possible, using the same intake assess-
ment method or biomarker assay is desirable to
facilitate the comparability of data over time.
9. Often, changing procedures, either by choice (technol-
ogy advances) or external stipulation (manufacturer
phases out or reformulates assay) is unavoidable. A
well-designed cross-over study is needed to enable data
comparison over time.
10. Internal quality control, regular assay verifications,
and external quality assurance are essential to ensure
and document technical proficiency of the labora-
tory and the performance of the biomarker assay
over time.
11. Reference materials should be used regularly, when
available, to assess the bias of the biomarker assay
and document consistent performance over time.
12. The traceability of the biomarker assay to a higher-
order reference method is desirable because it is an
important step to assay standardization and making
laboratory data comparable.

To effectively formulate and later evaluate nutrition
policy, many data pieces are needed. The following list
is by no means all inclusive:
1. Nutrition biomarker data Á when possible, multiple
biomarkers should be assessed to facilitate inter-
pretation of the data.
2. Dietary intake data Á data available should allow
estimation of usual intakes to minimize intra-
individual variation.
3. Supplement usage information Á to allow a separate
assessment of nutrient sources.
4. Demographic characteristics Á to describe the nutri-
tional status of the population by relevant subpo-
pulations.
5. Behavioral factors Á to explain differences seen in
nutritional status.
6. Health indicators Á to study associations between
nutritional status and health.
7. Sample various population groups Á to assess
whether special groups of interest may have addi-
tional nutritional needs.
8. Monitoring over multiple years Á to allow analysis
of time trends.
Methods to assess nutrition status continually evolve;
assays to measure biomarkers as well as dietary assess-
ment methods are subject to constant change and
improvement. As a result, a comprehensive quality-
assessment system should be implemented at the onset
of the survey to ensure meaningful data interpretation
later. Utilization of combinations of biomarkers and
dietary questionnaire information helps to better under-
stand nutrition effects in relation to disease occurrence.
