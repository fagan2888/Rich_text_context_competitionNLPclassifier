DURING THE LAST DECADE, THE
prevalence of obesity has in-
creased substantially.1-3 Part
of this rise has been attrib-
uted to increasingly sedentary life-
styles. Recent data suggest that most
residents of the United States do not
participate in regular physical activity
at recommended levels.4
In addition to reducing obesity, regu-
lar physical activity has been shown to
reduce morbidity and mortality asso-
ciated with coronary artery disease, hy-
pertension, diabetes, and osteoporo-
sis.5-11 Because there is strong evidence
that exercise is beneficial, several or-
ganizations, including the US Preven-
tive Services Task Force, recommend
that physicians advise all patients seen
in a primary care setting to increase
physical activity, despite the limited
available data on the effectiveness of
counseling about exercise.4,11-18 How-
ever, physician surveys suggest that
physicians generally counsel only a
minority of patients.19-22 Physicians
frequently cite time limitations as a
reason for not counseling.22 Further-
more, physician specialty, personal
fitness, and perceived success at advis-
ing patients are also correlated with
physician counseling practices.19,22
The influence of patient sociodemo-
graphic and clinical characteristics on
physiciancounselingpracticeislessclear.
Failuretocommunicateeffectivelyabout
exercise, particularly with women, ra-
cial and ethnic minorities, and mem-
bersoflowersocioeconomicgroupswho
are at high risk for weight gain and obe-
sity, may be contributing to the in-
crease in obesity in these groups.2,3,23
We used data from a nationally rep-
resentative sample collected as part of
the 1995 National Health Interview Sur-
vey (NHIS) to examine physician coun-
seling about exercise and to identify fac-
tors associated with counseling.
METHODS
The NHIS is a nationwide, in-person
household survey conducted by the US
Census Bureau for the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics.24 The NHIS uses
a multistage probability design to per-
mit continuous sampling of the US ci-
vilian noninstitutionalized popula-
tion. The overall response rate in 1995
was 94%. Approximately 102 000 per-
sons (including children) from approxi-

Context The increase in sedentary lifestyle may contribute to the rise in obesity na-
tionally. Although guidelines suggest that physicians counsel all patients about exer-
cise, physicians counsel only a minority of their patients. Whether patient factors in-
fluence physician counseling is not well established.
Objectives To examine and to identify factors associated with exercise counseling
by US physicians.
Design and Setting National population-based supplemental (Year 2000) survey
to the 1995 National Health Interview Survey.
Participants Of the 17 317 respondents to the Year 2000 supplemental survey, 9711
adults had seen a physician in the previous year, and 9299 responded when asked
about physician counseling on exercise.
Main Outcome Measure Physician counseling to begin or to continue to exercise.
Results Of 9299 respondents, 34% reported being counseled about exercise at their
last visit. After adjustment for other sociodemographic and clinical factors, women were
slightly more likely to be counseled, with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 1.15 (95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.29). Physicians counseled older patients (30 years) more
often than younger patients; those aged 40 to 49 years were counseled most often (AOR,
1.71 [95% CI, 1.34-2.20]). Patients with incomes above $50 000, those with higher lev-
els of physical activity, college graduates, and patients who were overweight to obese
(body mass index: 25 to 30 kg/m2) were more likely to be counseled, as were patients
with cardiac disease (AOR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.52-2.14]) and diabetes (AOR, 1.87 [95%
CI, 1.46-2.38]). Counseling did not vary by physician specialty or patient race.
Conclusion The rate of physician counseling about exercise is low nationally. Phy-
sicians appear to counsel as secondary prevention and are less likely to counsel pa-
tients at risk for obesity. The failure to counsel younger, disease-free adults and those
from lower socioeconomic groups may represent important missed opportunities for
primary prevention.

mately 39 000 households responded to
the core survey, which elicited infor-
mation on sociodemographic factors in-
cluding occupation, insurance cover-
age,basichealthstatus,visitsorcontacts
with health care providers, days hos-
pitalized, height, and weight. Respon-
dents also were asked about func-
tional limitations and whether they had
a usual place for health care, a usual
health care practitioner, and the clini-
cian's specialty.
In addition, a supplemental survey
("Year 2000 Supplement") was admin-
istered to 1 randomly selected adult,
aged 18 years or older, from one half of
the responding households (n = 17 317
respondents). Respondents were que-
ried about 6 common chronic medical
conditions (diabetes; asthma, emphy-
sema, chronic bronchitis, or tuberculo-
sis; chronic kidney disease; chronic liver
disease or cirrhosis; cancer; and chronic
cardiac-related disease). They were also
askedabouttobaccouse,attemptstolose
weight, and their participation in a list
of leisure or sport activities in the 2
weeks prior to the interview and the fre-
quency of participation. Respondents
who reported having had a medical
check-up (any visit interpreted by the
respondent to be a check-up) within the
previousyear(n=9711)werealsoasked,
"During your last (medical) check-up,
did the doctor recommend that you be-
gin or continue to do any type of exer-
cise or physical activity?"
Respondents to the Year 2000
supplement who reported a medical
check-up within the previous year and
who were asked about physician coun-
seling about exercise were eligible for
this study sample. We considered those
who reported that their physician ad-
vised them either to start or to con-
tinue exercise to have received coun-
seling.
Using information available in NHIS,
we defined factors hypothesized to in-
fluence physician counseling about ex-
ercise. These included patient socio-
demographic factors such as age, sex,
race, marital status, education, in-
come, insurance type, and region of the
country. We also considered clinical
factors, such as comorbid illness, over-
all illness burden (self-reported health
status, number of hospital days in pre-
vious year, visits or contacts with a
health care provider, difficulty walk-
ing), tobacco use, and body mass in-
dex (BMI) (defined as weight in kilo-
grams divided by square of height in
meters). We considered the specialty of
the patient's usual health care pro-
vider (general internist or family prac-
titioner; gynecologist; other special-
ist; or other health care provider type)
and whether the patient had a usual
place for health care.
We performed bivariable analyses to
compare unadjusted exercise counsel-
ing rates across various factors. We fit
logistic regression models using back-
ward elimination and the Wald 2 test
to identify sociodemographic, clini-
cal, and physician factors associated
with physician counseling. Two-
tailed P.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. The final model in-
cluded all statistically significant
independent factors and confounders.
Confounders were factors that, when
added to the final model, altered the re-
gression coefficients of any significant
independent variable by at least 10%.
We performed additional analyses to
examine the stability of our findings.
First, we adjusted our primary multi-
variable model for whether patients
were attempting to lose weight at the
time of survey administration to ac-
count for patient-initiated counseling.
We hypothesized that patients who
were actively attempting to lose weight
would have been more likely to ini-
tiate counseling with their physicians;
this might explain any association be-
tween physician counseling and fac-
tors correlated with patients' goals of
losing weight, such as BMI and health-
seeking behaviors. Second, we ad-
justed for what patients' physical ac-
tivity levels were in the 2 weeks prior
to the survey. We classified respon-
dents into low (sedentary), moderate,
or high activity level based on a vali-
dated method described previously.25
Those who participated in moderate ac-
tivity (eg, walking, gardening, bowl-
ing) more than 4 times a week or vig-
orous activity (eg, running, swimming,
playing tennis) more than 2 times a
week were classified as having high
physical activity level. Respondents re-
porting 1 to 4 moderate-level activi-
ties or 1 to 2 vigorous activities a week
were classified as practicing moderate
physical activity. All others were con-
sidered sedentary. Third, we exam-
ined the effect of respondent occupa-
tions on factors associated with
physician counseling by performing
subgroup analyses for respondents who
reported occupations involving high
levels of physical activity (eg, police or
firefighters; cleaning or building servi-
cepeople; laborers) and in those who
reported sedentary occupations (eg, ex-
ecutives, administrators, or managers;
scientists; health care providers; teach-
ers, librarians, or counselors; techni-
cians). This classification was based on
NHIS-defined categories24; we did not
include categories that could not be
readily classified. We were able to clas-
sify 61% of those eligible who re-
portedhavinganoccupation(n=5321).
We also examined the effect of miss-
ing income data on our model, be-
cause approximately 14% (n = 1260) of
our study sample lacked information
about income. To obtain an annual es-
timate of household income for those
with missing data, we multiplied by 12
the monthly income imputed by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics based
on age, sex, race, family status, and
other economic and health character-
istics.25 We applied our model to this
larger sample (including respondents
with imputed data) to test the stability
and generalizability of our findings.
We used statistical analysis soft-
ware for proper variance estimation in
all analyses.26,27 Results were weighted
to adjust for nonresponse to reflect US
population estimates. We used Taylor
series linearization to estimate SEs.26,27

9299 responded when asked about phy-
sician counseling about exercise.
TABLE 1 displays the sociodemo-
graphic characteristics of the study
sample (n = 9299) and the unadjusted
rates of counseling by these character-
istics. The overall rate of physician
counseling about exercise was 34%.
Counseling rates did not vary signifi-
cantly by physician specialty (P = .69).
Of adults who reported a general in-
ternist or family practitioner as their
usual provider, 35% received counsel-
ing to exercise. If the usual provider was
a gynecologist or a specialist, patients
reported counseling rates of 36% and
37%, respectively. Rates of counseling
also did not differ by patient sex or race;
however, physicians were more likely
to counsel patients who were older than
30 years, who were married, and who
were of higher socioeconomic status.
TABLE 2 shows the clinical charac-
teristics of the study sample along with
unadjusted rates of counseling. Physi-
cians counseled overweight (BMI, 25 to
30 kg/m2) and obese respondents
(BMI 30 kg/m2) at higher rates than
those with lower BMI (25 kg/m2).
However, physicians were less likely to
counsel those who were more seden-
tary and more likely to counsel respon-
dents with cardiac disease and diabe-
tes. Patients who reported frequent
physician visits or contacts also were
more likely to be counseled.
TABLE 3 presents factors that were in-
dependently associated with exercise
counseling after adjustment (n = 7410).
Age remained a significant correlate,
with adults aged 40 to 49 years being
counseled most often to exercise.
Women were more likely to be coun-
seled than men, as were patients with
incomes above $50 000 and higher edu-
cation. Patients who were uninsured or
who had Medicaid insurance were
counseled less often. Compared with
normal-weight patients (BMI, 18.5 to
25 kg/m2), obese patients (BMI 30
kg/m2) were significantly more likely to
receive counseling about exercise. Pa-
tients with cardiac disease and diabe-
tes were more likely to report counsel-
ing as well. Patients were less likely to
be counseled if they were single, used
tobacco, had difficulty walking, and had
infrequent physician visits or contacts
in the previous year.
Physician specialty, previous hospi-
talization, perceived health status, and
comorbid illnesses other than cardiac
disease and diabetes were not indepen-
dently associated with physician coun-
seling after multivariable adjustment
and did not confound the relationship
between independent variables in our
model and physician counseling about
exercise.
When we adjusted ourfinalmodelfor
whetherrespondentswereattemptingto

were no longer significant (P = .48); the
odds ratio for women was 0.96 (95%

pations (n = 526) also produced similar
results to those of our primary analysis.
In particular, the association of physi-
cian counseling with patient income,
education, and insurance type was not
diminished. Also, to test the generaliz-
ability and stability of our major find-
ings, we included patients with missing
income data using National Center for
Health StatisticsÂ­imputed income and
applied our final model to this larger
sample (n = 8488). These results were
consistent with those obtained from our
primary sample.
COMMENT
We found the national rate of physi-
cian exercise counseling to be 34%
among patients who saw a physician in
the previous year for a medical check-
up. Women and racial and ethnic mi-
norities were counseled as often as men
and whites after adjustment for other
sociodemographic and clinical fac-
tors. However, physicians counseled
sedentary patients and those with lower
socioeconomic status less often. More-
over, physicians appeared to counsel as
a form of secondary prevention, as evi-
denced by higher counseling rates in pa-
tients who were already obese, who
were older than 30 years, or who had
comorbid conditions.
Although our findings are consis-
tent with physician surveys and previ-
ous studies on behavioral counseling,
this study is the first, to our knowl-
edge, to confirm these findings relating
to counseling about exercise using a na-
tionally representative sample.19,21,22,28
Physicians consistently report that they
counselaminorityoftheirpatientsabout
exercise.19,21,22,28 Although few studies
identify patient characteristics associ-
ated with physical activity counseling,
data from behavioral counseling on
smoking cessation show that physi-
cians tend to counsel patients whose
health is already compromised.28,29
Smaller studies also show that patients
who have heart disease or cardiovascu-
lar risk factors are more likely to be
counseled about physical activity.28-30
The low rate of physician counsel-
ing is especially troubling given the in-
creasing prevalence of obesity and sed-
entary lifestyle nationally. Patients who
are in poorer health and who are obese
may be more motivated to make life-
style changes and should be aggres-
sively counseled. Failure to counsel
healthier and disease-free adults, how-
ever, may represent important missed
opportunities. Evidence indicates that
adults between the ages of 25 and 35
years, sedentary individuals, and those
with low socioeconomic status are
at high risk for obesity and weight
gain.2,3,23,31 Our study reveals that these
groups are particularly at risk for not
being counseled by physicians. More-

over, differences in leisure time or oc-
cupation-related activity level did not
explain the disparities by age and so-
cioeconomic status. These findings are
consistent with results from 1 survey
that showed that physicians who esti-
mated a higher proportion of their pa-
tients as nonsedentary were more likely
to counsel.22 The lower rates of coun-
seling in respondents with lower edu-
cation and income levels, even after ad-
justing for access to health care, illness
burden, and activity level, are particu-
larly worrisome, because members of
lower socioeconomic groups have
poorer health outcomes.23
Physicians' perceptions that coun-
seling may be ineffective may explain
the low rate of physical activity coun-
seling. Given competing time pres-
sures and limited resources, physi-
cians may elect to pursue other, more
proven preventive measures such as
cancer screening. Moreover, physi-
cians may be targeting their counsel-
ing efforts at those most likely to ben-
efit from exercise. Despite strong
evidence suggesting that physical ac-
tivity is beneficial, few data are avail-
able on the long-term effectiveness of
exercise counseling. Several studies ex-
amining the efficacy of physician ad-
vice about exercise have shown posi-
tive results.11-15 The majority of these
studies, however, were not random-
ized or well controlled; many also
lacked follow-up data beyond a few
weeks and were limited in generaliz-
ability.12,15 The few available random-
ized trials have shown conflicting re-
sults.11,13,14 The Johns Hopkins Medicare
Preventive Services Demonstration
Project, which examined the effect of
preventive health examinations in an
elderly population, found no signifi-
cant increase in physical activity level
in those randomized to receive exer-
cise counseling.11 However, a second
study demonstrated a statistically sig-
nificant increase in exercise activity af-
ter counseling. The OXCHECK trial
randomized 2205 patients in England
to receive physical activity counseling
and 5 follow-up visits by trained
nurses.13 After 3 years, a significantly
higher proportion of the intervention
group (32.4%) compared with the con-
trol group (29.1%) reported vigorous
exercise more than once a month.
Finally, perceptions that counseling
is less effective in certain patient
populations may explain the variable
rates across certain patient sub-
groups. For example, physicians may
believe that counseling patients with
lower socioeconomic status is less ef-
fective. Data,however,demonstratethat
low-income patients are actually more
likely to attempt behavioral change
based on physician advice.32
Although we used data from a large,
nationally generalizable sample, our re-
sults are subject to recall bias. Some re-
spondents may not have remembered
discussions with physicians about ex-
ercise even when they occurred. This
bias would underestimate actual coun-
seling rates; nevertheless, patients' re-
call may be an accurate reflection of the
quality of physician discussions and the
influence of these discussions on the pa-
tient. Second, the rate of counseling
about exercise we report only repre-
sents counseling that took place dur-
ing the most recent medical check-up
and does not necessarily reflect an-
nual rates, except in patients with only
a single physician visit in the previous
year. In patients who had multiple phy-
sician visits in the previous year, we
would not have had access to data about
counseling that occurred at an earlier
visit. However, those with more fre-
quent health care provider visits and
contacts were more likely to report that
counseling took place. Third, we were
also unable to differentiate between
physician- and patient-initiated coun-
seling. The correlates of counseling we
identified may represent correlates of
health-seekingbehavior.Controllingfor
whether respondents were attempting
to lose weight did not alter our find-
ings substantially, however. We at-
tempted to adjust for physical activity
level, but the available data referred to
activity during the 2 weeks prior to sur-
vey and not necessarily to baseline ac-
tivity at the time of the physician visit.
Patients who receive physician coun-
seling about physical activity may be
more likely to initiate exercise, which
would explain our observation that per-
sons who engaged in more physical ac-
tivity were more likely to be coun-
seled. However, given the modest
efficacyofphysiciancounseling,it is un-
likely that this phenomenon com-
pletely explains the lower rates of coun-
seling in more sedentary patients.
Finally, we had limited information
about clinician characteristics or prac-
tice beliefs other than specialty.
Our findings demonstrate that the
rate of physician counseling about ex-
ercise in the United States is low. Phy-
sicians often counsel patients to exer-
cise as a form of secondary prevention
and undercounsel certain groups at
high risk for obesity, weight gain, and
sedentary lifestyle. In particular, the fail-
ure to counsel younger, disease-free,
and sedentary adults and those from
lower socioeconomic groups might rep-
resent important missed opportuni-
ties for primary prevention that could
lead to adverse public health out-
comes. Given that the problems of obe-
sity and sedentary lifestyle have reached
epidemic proportions in the United
States, even modest benefits from rela-
tively benign interventions, such as
counseling to increase physical activ-
ity, may have a substantial public health
impact. Additional studies are needed
to evaluate the effectiveness of physi-
cian counseling about exercise and the
effectiveness of interventions de-
