American Adolescents: Sexual Mixing Patterns, Bridge Partners,
and Concurrency
KATHLEEN FORD, PHD, WOOSUNG SOHN, DRPH, AND JAMES LEPKOWSKI, PHD
Background: American adolescents have a high incidence of
sexually transmitted infections. Patterns of sexual partner
choice influence the transmission of infections in this
population.
Goal: To examine patterns of sexual mixing, bridging, and
concurrency in American adolescents and the association of
these characteristics with condom use.
Study Design: This project used the AddHEALTH survey
data. The survey selected a sample of schools, then conducted
in-home interviews with 18,984 students in 1995. A second
wave of data collection was conducted 2 years later. The data
on sexual relationships collected in the study were analyzed.
Results: Respondents ranged in age from 13 to 17 years. Sex
partnerships with persons of differing age groups were very
common in this population (45% of sexual partnerships). Re-
lationships with persons of different ethnicity were more com-
mon among Latinos (42%) than among white (14%) and black
(15%) respondents. A large proportion of the sample reported
more than two partners (56%). Among these persons, a large
proportion reported partners in two different age groups
(69%) and ethnic groups (35%) as well as concurrent partners
(54%). Condom use was lower among persons with partners in
different age groups and among persons with a larger number
of partners.
Conclusions: The large number of adolescents who have
sexual relationships with persons of different characteristics
creates bridges for infections between different groups. Coun-
seling of sexually active adolescents should include discussion
on issues of power and communication in these relationships.
DISEASE TRANSMISSION MODELING has demon-
strated the importance of sexual mixing patterns in a pop-
ulation for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs). Sexual networks form the pathways across which
these infections are transmitted from one person to another.
Unlike casual contact, sexual partnering is nonrandom and
has major consequences for the rate and extent to which an
infection can spread.1­4 Strong assortive mating can lead to
multiple, decoupled epidemics in a population,5,6 whereas
random mating tends to generate slower but larger epidem-
ics in the long run.7,8
Hallinan and Williams9 discussed five factors identified
in the social psychology literature that act as bases of
interpersonal attraction: propinquity, similarity, comple-
mentarity, status, and reciprocity. Propinquity and similarity
are believed to have the greatest impact on friendship for-
mation. Individuals are more likely to establish ties with
those with whom they have more opportunities to interact.
Furthermore, given propinquity, individuals are more likely
to form relationships with those similar to themselves in
attitudes, values, and behavior. Hence, because ethnic
groups are segregated residentially, and because shared
cultural values exist within ethnic groups, individuals may
be more likely to have relationships with members of their
own race or ethnic groups. Relationships with individuals
who have like characteristics can be designated as assorta-
tive (like with like), and relationships with those who have
different ethnicity as disassortative.

Research on sexual networks has identified aspects of
sexual behavior that affect the transmission of infection:
multiple partnerships, patterns of partner selection, bridging
partners, concurrent partners, use of condoms with different
types of partners, and other measures of sexual behavior.
The transmission of infections between two different
groups depends on the presence of bridge partners, or per-
sons who have sexual intercourse with individuals in both
groups. The practice of younger women having sex with
older men assisted in the transmission of HIV infection to
younger cohorts in Africa,10 and the practice of older men
having sex with younger men facilitated the spread of HIV
infection among gay men in the United States.11,12 Further-
more, in a study on the sexual networks of American adults,
it was noted that the higher infection rates for bacterial
STDs among blacks can be explained by patterns of sexual
networks within and between different racial/ethnic
groups.13
Sex partnerships that overlap in time, or concurrent part-
nerships, also have been identified as explanations for dif-
ferences in disease prevalence among different popula-
tions.14­17 Concurrent partnerships increase the opportunity
for an infection to spread quickly in a network of sexual
partners by allowing infections during a given period to be
transmitted to and from each partner who participates in the
network. Concurrency in sexual networks has been identi-
fied as a factor associated with the spread of HIV infection
in Uganda,15 and with the risk of chlamydia infection in a
community study in Colorado.17
Differences the characteristics of partners, particularly
differences in partner age, may have an effect on sexual
behavior and the use of condoms. Only a small number of
analyses have considered the effects of partner characteris-
tics on condom use and the use of contraceptives. Differ-
ences in age or other characteristics of partners may reflect
differences in the power to make decisions in a relationship,
and these differences in power may affect the degree to
which condoms or other contraceptive methods are used.
For example, in a study on the degree of control that young
women have over their first intercourse, Abma et al18,19
found that women whose first sexual partners were signif-
icantly older than themselves were more likely to report that
the intercourse was involuntary. These women also were
less likely to report that contraceptives were used.
American adolescents experience high rates of STD in-
fection.20 As compared with older adults, adolescents (10-
to 19-year-olds) and young adults (20- to 24-year-olds) are
at higher risk for acquiring STDs because they may be more
likely to have multiple partners, to engage in unprotected
intercourse, and to select higher risk partners. In addition,
adolescent women may have an increased risk of infection
with Chlamydia trachomatis because of cervical
ectopy.21­24
Although a large literature exists on adolescent sexual
behavior in the United States, relatively little information is
available on the sexual mixing patterns of adolescents. The
objectives of this report are to describe the mixing patterns
of American adolescents by age and ethnicity, to describe
the patterns of bridging partners and concurrency by age
and ethnicity, and to examine the association of bridging
and concurrency in this population with condom use.
Methods
Data for this study was drawn from the National Longi-
tudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth). The Ad-
dHealth data were designed to assess the health status of
adolescents, and to explore the causes of their health-related
behaviors, focusing on the effects of multiple contexts or
environments (both social and physical) in which they
live.25 A sample of schools was selected by Quality Edu-
cation Data, Inc. The sample of schools was stratified by
region, urbanicity (urban, suburban, or rural), school type
(public, private, or parochial), ethnic mix, and size. Conse-
quently, 80 schools were selected by probability propor-
tional to size. More than 70% of the originally sampled high
schools participated in the study. If a school refused to
participate, a replacement school was selected from the
same stratum.
Participating schools provided a roster of students for use
in the project. In most cases, schools also agreed to admin-
ister the in-school questionnaire to each student during one
class period. The in-school sample was completed by
90,118 students in 1994­1995.
Once a high school was selected, a feeder school (one that
included seventh grade students and sent its graduates to
that high school) was recruited. A feeder school then was
selected in each of 80 communities.
Next, a sample of students on school rosters was selected
to participate in an in-home interview. Students were
grouped into 12 grade and gender strata within a school, and
an average of 17 students were selected randomly from each
within-school strata. This method yielded approximately
200 students for in-home interviews from each of 132
schools. In 16 small schools, all the students were selected
for in-home interviews.
Respondents selected through this two-stage sampling
procedure constituted a nationally representative sample of
adolescents. Additional students were chosen to represent a
number of ethnic groups and disabled students, and to create
genetic samples of related individuals. Only students se-
lected from the nationally representative sample were in-
cluded in this study. This nationally representative sample
provided data on 18,924 respondents interviewed in their
homes in wave 1.
In a second wave conducted 2 years later, 13,570 wave 1
respondents were interviewed in their homes. Data from
14 Sexually Transmitted Diseases  January 2002
FORD ET AL
both the Wave 1 and the Wave 2 interviews are included in
this report.
This analysis focuses on the sexually active portion of the
sample. During the in-home interview, information on sex-
ual activity was obtained through two different sequences of
questions. Respondents were asked a direct question on
whether they ever had sexual intercourse. In wave 1, of the
18,924 respondents, 7508 reported ever having sexual in-
tercourse. Of the 13,570 respondents in wave 2, 5989 re-
ported that they had sexual intercourse. Merging the two
waves of data, 9303 respondents distinctly reported ever
having sexual intercourse.
The unit of analysis in this report consists of both indi-
vidual records and sexual relationships. For the analysis
related to sexual partners, the respondent level data file had
to be converted from one with a record for each individual
to a file with a record for each sexual partner. The 9,303
individuals who answered the direct question affirmatively
reported having 26,657 sexual partners.
In each of the two waves, the respondents were asked to
report on relationships in the preceding 18 months. Some
telescoping might have occurred, such that respondents
reported relationships in wave 2 that began more than 18
months before. Relationships reported by the same respon-
dent in waves 1 and 2 were compared on five variables
including demographic and relationship variables. This pro-
cedure identified 724 relationships (2.7% of the sample
relationships) that likely were duplicates. These relationship
records were deleted from the relationship data set. Finally,
relationships for which the respondent did not report sexual
intercourse with that partner were deleted from the file.
Examination of the data on partners also showed that
some individuals who answered the direct question by say-
ing they never had sexual intercourse later reported inter-
course when asked about specific partners. From these
cases, 363 additional relationships were added to the rela-
tionship file. Only 20 of the reported relationships were
homosexual. These were deleted from the file. The total
number of heterosexual relationships used in the analysis
was 17,266, which were reported by 8,024 individuals.
In the 16 schools wherein all the respondents were eligi-
ble for the in-home interview, a large number of relation-
ships (but not all) were reported by both partners, causing
those relationships to be overrepresented in the analysis.
Tabulations provided by the AddHealth staff at the Univer-
sity of North Carolina on the frequency of relationships
reported by both partners allowed adjustments to the sam-
pling weights that compensated for the overrepresentation
of these relationships.
Statistical Methods
Cross-tabulations were developed to examine respondent
and partner agreement on variables such as age and ethnic-
ity. To test the significance of differences between distribu-
tions, 2 statistics were used. The SUDAAN statistical
package was used to estimate standard errors of percent-
ages, taking the clustered design into account.26
To examine the association between individual charac-
teristics and condom use, a logistic regression analysis was
used. The SUDAAN statistical package was used to gener-
ate logistic models using sampling clusters to group obser-
vations.23 The results are reported as important if the P
values of a test statistic were smaller than 0.05.
ADDHealth data includes weights designed to compen-
sate for unequal probabilities of selection and nonresponse.
Each relationship was assigned the corresponding wave 1 or
2 weight for the respondent. Weights were used in all
analyses to provide national estimates of relationship char-
acteristics for adolescents.
Measures
Age. The data on age were coded in single years for both
respondent and sexual partner. Differences between ages of
the partners were coded as more than 2 years older, within
2 years, and more than 2 years younger.
Ethnicity. The data on respondent and partner ethnicity were
coded as white, black, Latino, or other. These data were collected
by the respondent's report of his or her most important ethnicity.
Patterns of mixed ethnicity were not analyzed because only 2.7%
of the respondents reported a second ethnicity.
Condom use. Condom use refers to whether the respon-
dent ever reported using condoms with sexual partners.
Gender. Gender refers to the reported gender of the
respondent.
Concurrency. Concurrency was determined by examin-
ing the dates for the first and last times the respondents had

sex in the relationship. Persons with concurrent relation-
ships had overlapping dates.
Bridge age. A respondent was classified as a bridge
person for age if he or she had partners in more than one age
group. Age groups were classified as more than 2 years
younger than the respondent, within 2 years of the respon-
dent's age, or more than 2 years older than the respondent.
Bridge race. Bridge race was defined as a respondent
with a partner in more than one ethnic group.
Results
Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the
respondents in the study who reported sexual relationships.
Of the approximately 8000 persons, 11% were age 14 years
or younger, 36% were ages 15 to 16 years, and 54% were
age 17 years or older. More than half of the sample (62%)
was white, 19.2% were black, 11.7% were Latino, and 7%
were of other races.
Partner Choice
Table 2 shows descriptive data on relationship partners
by age, gender, and ethnicity. In the total sample, 78% of
the partnerships were with someone of the same ethnicity,
and 22% were with someone of a different ethnicity. Age
differences between partners were common in the sample.
Approximately 55% of the relationships included a partner
within 2 years of age. However, older partners were re-
ported in nearly one third of the relationships, and younger
partners in the remainder (12.6%).
The age of the respondent was associated with several of
the partner characteristic variables. The older respondents
were somewhat more likely to have a partner of the same
ethnicity (80%) than the youngest respondents (74%). The age
of the respondent also was related to age differences between
partners. The youngest respondents (age 14 years or younger)
were more likely to have partners two or more years older
(41%), and few partners two or more years younger (3%). The
oldest age group (age 17 years or more) had a substantially
larger proportion of partners who were two or more years older
(28%) and two or more years younger (17%).
Gender was not associated significantly with ethnicity of
partner. However, the girls were more likely than the boys
to have partners two or more years older (49% of the girls
versus 14% of the boys), whereas the boys were more likely
to have partners two or more years younger (22% of the
boys versus 4% of the girls).
Ethnicity was related to several characteristics of partner
choice. Both white and black respondents had a low per-
centage of partners of other races (13% of the whites versus
15% of the blacks), whereas Latinos and others had a higher
percentage (42% and 77%). The age of the partner did not
differ among ethnic groups.

ported more than one partner. Approximately 44% of the

total sample reported one partner, and 56% reported more
than one partner.
Small ethnic differences were observed in the proportion
of respondents reporting multiple partners. A higher pro-
portion of black (61%) and other respondents (59%) re-
ported multiple partners than Latino (55.8%) and white
respondents (54%) (P  0.05).
Gender differences in the reporting of multiple partners
differed by ethnic group. Among white respondents, the
girls reported a slightly higher proportion of multiple part-
ners (52.4% of the boys versus 55.9% of the girls, P 
0.05). However, among black and Latino respondents, more
of the boys reported more than one partner (blacks: 63.1%
of the boys versus 58.5% of the girls, P  0.05; Latino:
59.3% of the boys versus 51% of the girls, P  0.05).
The percentage of adolescents with bridge and concurrent
relationships is shown in Table 4 for adolescents with two
or more partners. Slightly more than half (54%) of this
subsample of respondents reported concurrent partners.
Among ethnic groups, the proportion of persons reporting
concurrent partners did not differ significantly.
Gender differences were present in the reporting of con-
current partners. Among all the respondents, the girls re-
ported concurrent partnerships more often than boys (58%
of the girls versus 50% of the boys, P  0.05). This
difference was found in all the ethnic groups.
Two types of bridge partners were considered in this
analysis: bridge by age and bridge by race. Bridge by age,
or the reporting of partners from two different age groups,
was very common in this population. Approximately 69%
of the respondents reported partners in two different age
groups. The percentages were slightly lower for black and
Latino respondents (66% of the blacks versus 65% of the
Latinos).
The girls were much more likely to report partners in two
different age groups than the boys (61% of the boys versus
77% of the girls, P  0.01). The girls in each ethnic group
also reported partners in two different age groups more
often than the boys.
Bridge by ethnicity, or respondents with partners in two
different ethnic groups, was less common in this sample
than respondents with partners in different age groups.
Approximately 35% of the respondents reported that they
had sexual partners from two different ethnic groups. The
four ethnic groups differed on this variable. Members of
Latino and other groups were much more likely to report
partners in two ethnic groups (Latino 60%, other 90%).
Gender influenced the patterns of bridging by ethnicity.
Among white respondents, the girls were more likely to
report partners of different ethnicity than the boys (28% of
the girls versus 24% of the boys, P  0.05). For black and
Latino respondents, the situation was reversed, with the
boys more likely to report partners of different ethnicity
than the girls (black: 35% of the boys versus 19% of the
girls; Latino: 62% of the boys versus 57% of the girls, P 
0.01).

ADOLESCENT SEXUAL MIXING PATTERNS, BRIDGE PARTNERS, AND CONCURRENCY
Condom Use
The percentage of respondents who reported using a
condom with at least one partner is shown in Table 5.
Approximately one third of the respondents had used a
condom with at least one partner. Those with bridge or
concurrent partners were less likely to have used a condom
with their partners.
Table 6 shows a logistic regression with condom use as
the dependent variable. In the first model, not including the
number of partners, concurrency was significant and related
to increased condom use (odds ratio [OR], 1.20; CI, 1.01­
1.44; P  0.05). Ethnicity was not related to condom use.
Girls were less likely to report condom use than boys (OR,
0.79; CI, 0.65­0.94; P  0.01) Respondents who reported
partners in two different age groups also reported reduced
condom use (OR, 0.80; CI, 0.65­0.94; P  0.05). Among
those who reported partners in more than two ethnic groups
no significant differences in condom use were observed.
The number of partners reported was associated with re-
duced condom use (OR, 0.45; CI, 0.41­ 0.49). Two-way
interactions between independent variables were tested, but
not found to be significant.
Conclusions
Data from a national survey of American youth, the
ADDHealth study, provided an opportunity to examine the
characteristics of sexual networks among American youth.
The analysis showed some significant features of these
sexual networks.
Existing theory predicted that similarity and propinquity
should influence the demographic characteristics of part-
ners. The data indicate that whereas some similarity exists
among partner characteristics, partners with different char-
acteristics also are quite common. Similarity can be found in
the ethnicity of the partners associated with both white and
black adolescents. Most partners come from the same ethnic
group. However, Latinos and respondents of other ethnicity
have partners of different ethnicity more frequently. These
results on ethnicity are consistent with those from studies of
U.S. adults27 and urban youth.28 In contrast to the results for
ethnicity, partners of different ages often were observed in
all ethnic groups. This was observed most often for female
respondents.
A large proportion of the sample respondents reported
more than two sexual partnerships, concurrent partnerships,
and partners in two different age groups. The reporting of
partners in two different ethnic groups varied strongly by
ethnicity. The reporting of multiple partners and partners in
two or more age or ethnic groups was very common in this
population. Bridging by age was very common among girls,
and bridging by ethnicity was very common among persons
in Latino and other ethnic groups. Concurrent partnerships
were common in all age and ethnic groups.
Condom use was reduced for persons with multiple part-
ners and for those with partners in different age groups.
When control was used for these factors, condom use was
found to have a positive relationship to concurrency, al-
though the bivariate relationship was negative.
In a network study of chlamydia infection, Potterat et al17
found that both concurrency and a disassortative mixing
pattern by ethnicity were associated with chlamydia trans-
mission. Although the dependent variable in the current
study was condom use rather than chlamydia infection,
other variables including number of partners and bridging
by age were more important predictors of reduced condom
use. Furthermore, in the multivariate analysis of the current
study, concurrency had a positive association with condom
use. Differences in results may have resulted from differ-
ences between adolescent and adult populations, and in the
study selection criteria.
In a study of sexual networks among American adults,
Laumann and Youm13 found that black adults usually se-
lected blacks as sexual partners, and that there was much
more mixing between core and periphery groups in the
black population. The current study found a high degree of
within-group choice among American adolescents, although
lack of information about the sexual behavior of adolescent
partners prevents a similar analysis of these data.
These findings from this study are important for STD
clinics, family planing clinics, and other health providers
who work with sexually active adolescents. Multiple rela-
tionships and relationships with persons of different age and
ethnic groups increase the vulnerability of adolescents to
