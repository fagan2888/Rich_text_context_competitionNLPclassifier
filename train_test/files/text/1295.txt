Purpose. We aim to examine the effect of Metabolic syndrome (MetS) on heart attack and overall mortality in
Mexican-American elderly persons over 7-year follow-up.
Methods. We studied 3050 Mexican Americans aged 65 or older from the Hispanic Established Population for the
Epidemiological Study of the Elderly conducted in five Southwestern states of the United States. Participants were
categorized into two groups: those with or without MetS. A total of 333 (11%) respondents at baseline had met the criteria
of MetS (at least three of five characteristics--hyperinsulinemia or fasting plasma glucose 110 mg/dl, abdominal
obesity, and hypertension--as defined by the World Health Organization).
Results. Of 333 participants with MetS, the mean age was 71.1 years and 68% were females (compared with 73.2 years
and 56% in those without MetS). Eighty percent of participants with MetS rated their health as fair or poor, compared to
55% of those participants without MetS. Fifty-four percent and 65% of patients with MetS had arthritis and at least one
impairment in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), compared to 39% and 55% of those participants without
MetS. MetS was significantly associated with increased incidence of heart attack (odds ratio: 2.75, 95% confidence
interval: 1.67­4.54) and was a significant predictor for overall mortality (hazard ratio: 1.46, 95% confidence interval:
1.16­1.84) over a 7-year period after adjusting for other demographic and clinical variables.
Conclusions. Among Mexican-American elderly participants, those with MetS had poorer self-rated health. MetS was
significantly associated with increased incidence of heart attack and higher mortality over a 7-year period.
METABOLIC syndrome (MetS) is a concurrence of
impaired glucose and insulin metabolism, overweight
and abdominal fat accumulation, mild dyslipidemia, and
hypertension (1). It is extremely common, particularly in
older individuals and in Mexican Americans (2). This
syndrome is important because of its association with
subsequent development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (3),
and cardiovascular diseases (4­6), and because of its
association with increased mortality from cardiovascular
disease and all causes (7). Alone, each component of the
cluster conveys increased cardiovascular risk, but in
combination they become a more powerful threat to health
(8). MetS is on the rise world-wide because of the obesity
epidemic and sedentary lifestyles (9).
MetS is characterized by insulin resistance and is also
known as Insulin Resistance Syndrome (IRS) (1,3,10), and
Syndrome X (11). The IRS is a condition characterized by
decreased tissue sensitivity to the action of insulin, leading
to a compensatory increase in insulin secretion (12). It is
characterized by the clinical characteristics of hypertension,
abdominal obesity, high triglyceride levels, and low HDL
levels (11,13). Family history of Type 2 diabetes is another
clinical factor that may also increase the risk for insulin
resistance (14,15).
The pathogenesis of this syndrome is still unclear,
although environmental factors such as diet and physical
activity, coupled with still largely unknown genetic factors,
clearly interact to produce it (4,6,11,15). However, resis-
tance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake seems to modify
biochemical responses in a way that predispose to metabolic
risk factors (11,13,16).
The prevalence of MetS, as defined by the Adult
Treatment Panel (ATP III) in the United States, was es-
timated to be 22% among U.S. adults (17) and it increases
rapidly with advancing age (2,6). By age 70, the incidence
of metabolic disorders reaches epidemic proportions
(13,15). The overall prevalence of MetS is lower in black
men than in white or Mexican-American men, and is higher
in Mexican-American women than in white or black women
(2,6). Epidemiological studies confirmed that MetS occurs
commonly in a wide variety of ethnic groups including
Europeans, African Americans, Native Americans, Mexican
Americans, Asian Indians and Chinese, Australian Aborig-
ines, Polynesians, and Micronesians (11,18).

Despite a substantial amount of research, definitions of
the MetS and the various cutoffs for its components have
varied widely (4,11). The recently released Third Report of
the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert panel
on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood
Cholesterol in Adults draws attention to the importance of
the MetS and provides a working definition of this
syndrome for the first time (19). Furthermore, the World
Health Organization (WHO) consultation for the classifica-
tion of diabetes and its complications (20) and the National
Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) expert panel (19)
have recently published the definitions of MetS.
Despite high prevalence of MetS, little is known about
other factors associated with it in older populations. A
variety of factors, including concomitant illnesses, general
health status, and socioeconomic factors, may influence
treatment decisions (19). We use cross-sectional data at
baseline and 7-year follow-up data to examine the impact
of MetS on heart attack incidence and overall mortality,
and to determine demographic and clinical characteristics
associated with MetS in community-dwelling older
Mexican Americans.
METHODS
Study Population Sample
The Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemio-
logical Study of the Elderly is a population-based study of
non-institutionalized Mexican Americans aged 65 or older
from five Southwestern states (Texas, California, New
Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona). Participants were selected
by using area probability sampling procedures that involved
selection of counties and households within selected cen-
sus tracts. Census tracts were selected with probabilities
proportional to the number of Mexican-American elderly
persons. These were the primary sampling units. Three
thousand fifty Mexican-American elderly persons (repre-
senting an 83% response rate) were interviewed in either
Spanish or English, depending on their preference. Of these,
2873 completed face-to-face interviews and 177 (5.8%)
were interviewed by proxy. In most cases, the proxy was
a close family member. Baseline interviews were obtained
in 1993­1994, the first follow-up in 1995­1996, the second
follow-up in 1998­1999, and the third follow-up in
2000­2001. Detailed information on the sampling plan
and interview process can be found in our previous
publications (21,22).
Measures
The MetS is defined as presence of either hyper-
insulinemia (upper quartile of the nondiabetic population)
or fasting plasma glucose 110 mg/dl (20,23,24) and at
least two of the following: 1) abdominal obesity (waist
circumference of .102 cm for men and .88 cm for women
or body mass index  30), 2) dyslipidemia (serum
triglyceride  150 mg/dl or HDL cholesterol , 35 mg/
dl); or 3) hypertension (blood pressure  140/90 mmHg or
treated with medication). In our study, a participant was
considered to have MetS if he or she had diabetes,
hypertension, and abdominal obesity. Serum lipids, which
are the other two criteria of the five characteristics of MetS,
were not taken into account in this population. Diabetes was
determined by asking participants if they had ever been
diagnosed with diabetes by a doctor. Blood pressure level
and abdominal measurement were taken and recorded by the
interviewer at the time of the interview. A respondent was
categorized as obese if he or she had a waist circumference
of .102 cm for men and .88 cm for women.
Sociodemographic factors included age, sex, marital
status (married or not married), years of education, living
arrangements, and health insurance coverage. Living
arrangements were determined by asking respondents if
they lived alone or with others. Respondents were also
asked if they had health insurance coverage (including
private, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits). Participants were
then classified as having or not having any coverage.
Health-related factors assessed at baseline included
smoking status, alcohol consumption, self-rated health
(excellent, good, fair, or poor), family history of diabetes,
duration of diabetes and hypertension, treatment received
for hypertension, previous heart attack, stroke, hip fracture,
and arthritis. Smoking status was measured by asking
respondents if they were current/former smokers or never
smoked. The number of cigarettes smoked per day was also
computed. Alcohol consumption was measured based on
current frequency and volume of consumption of beer, wine,
or liquor during the month prior to the interview. The
number of cans/bottles of beer, the number of glasses of
wine, and the number of alcoholic drinks consumed in the
past month were computed. Respondents who reported
a diagnosis of diabetes were also asked if they had a family
history of diabetes (categorized as none/unknown and one/
both parents). Duration of diabetes and/or hypertension was
categorized as ,10 years or 10 years. Treatment received
for hypertension was categorized as none, with medication,
or unknown. Other medical conditions were assessed by
asking respondents if they had ever been told by a doctor
that they had a previous history of heart attack, stroke, hip
fracture, or arthritis. The number of hospitalizations and
number of doctor's visits in the year prior to the baseline
interview were also recorded. Physical function was
measured using a modified version of the Katz Activities
of Daily Living (ADL) scale (25). The Instrumental
Activities of Daily Living (IADL) items were measured
from the modified Rosow­Breslau scale of mobility
function (26). Procedures used to collect information for
participants in the Hispanic Established Population for the
Epidemiological Study of the Elderly were provided in
previous publications (21,22). Causes of deaths among
deceased participants were determined from family mem-
bers and a mortality search performed using the National
Death Index.
Data Analysis
The percentages in Tables 1 and 2 were adjusted for
sampling weights and design effects to minimize any
clustering bias in our estimates using the SUDAAN program
(27). Logistic regression analyses and Cox proportional
hazards regression analyses were performed using the SAS
program (28). Logistic regression analyses (Table 3) were
467

used to assess the risk (odds ratio) of having a new heart
attack over the 7-year follow-up. Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis (Table 4) was used to estimate the risk of
mortality over the 7-year follow-up for people reporting
heart attack with and without presence of other risk factors.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the sociodemographic characteristics of
participants with and without MetS. Of the 3050 participants
at baseline, 333 (11%) reported having at least three
characteristics of MetS.
Participants with MetS had a mean age of 71.1 years
compared with 73.2 years for participants without MetS
(N ¼ 2717) (p , .0001). Sixty-eight percent of participants
with MetS were females, compared with 56% of those
without MetS (p ¼ .001). More participants with MetS
(94%) than without MetS (89%) were covered by health
insurance (p ¼ .007). No significant differences were found
between the two groups by marital status, level of education,
and living arrangements.
Table 2 shows that participants with MetS, in comparison
with those without MetS, were more likely to rate their
health as fair or poor (80% vs 55%) (p , .0001), to have
a family history of diabetes (24% vs 13%) (p ¼ .001), to
have diabetes (50% vs 38%) (p ¼ .05) and hypertension
(46% vs 32%) (p ¼ .0001) for ,10 years, to receive
treatment for hypertension (60% vs 51%) (p ¼ .0001), to
report having arthritis (54% vs 39%) (p ¼ .002), to have
more hospitalizations (28% vs 18%) (p ¼ .01), to have more
doctors visits (9.4 vs 5.8 mean) (p , .0001), and to report
more IADL disabilities (65% vs 55%) (p ¼ .01).
Table 3 shows that participants with MetS were twice as
likely than those without MetS to have a heart attack during
the 7-year study period (odds ratio: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.67­
4.54), controlling for other risk factors (age, being male,
living alone, years of education, smoking status, alcohol
consumption, ADL limitation, diabetes, hypertension,
and obesity).
Table 4 shows that participants with MetS were
significantly more likely than those without MetS to die
over the 7-year follow-up period (hazard ratio: 1.46, 95%

DISCUSSION
This study addressed the effect of MetS on incidence of
heart attacks and all-cause mortality in Mexican-American
elderly persons over the 7-year follow-up. The prevalence of
MetS in this population was 11%; this group was
significantly associated with increased risk of heart attack
and mortality over 7-year follow-up.
MetS is a widespread problem among U.S. adults, and the
prevalence rates are highly variable among ethnicities, ages,
body mass indexes, and lifestyle factors such as smoking
status, physical activity, and dietary caloric intake (6). For
example, studies based on the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) reported by Park and
colleagues (6) found that 27.2% of Mexican-American
females had MetS, followed by black women and white
women. Ford and colleagues (17) found that 31.9% of
Mexican-American adults have MetS. In both studies (6,17),
the age range was between 20 and 74 years; however, in our
study, age range was reported between 65 and 99 years.
Although lower educational level was not statistically
associated with MetS in our study, it is an important factor
for weight reduction and exercise program (6,17). One study
reported that U.S. blacks with a lower educational level
were more likely to engage in less physical activity during
leisure time than were whites (29).
The waist circumference measure is a simple and useful
tool for identifying patients who are susceptible to MetS
(30). Waist circumference measure was one of the tools used
in our study to measure abdominal obesity for the MetS
definition. Eighty percent of Mexican-American elderly
participants with MetS had poorer self-rated health. Also,
greater percentages of participants with MetS were hospi-
talized (p ¼ .01) and had doctor's visits (p  .0001) within
the year before the interview compared with the participants
without MetS. Current smoking was not found to occur
more frequently among the participants with MetS, whereas
other studies (6,31) reported an association between
smoking and MetS. Family history of diabetes was found
to be statistically significantly higher in those participants
with MetS (p ¼ .001).
At 7-year follow-up, 13% of participants with MetS had
a heart attack, and 37% died. MetS (odds ratio: 2.75, 95%
CI: 1.67­4.54) was a predicting factor for heart attack in this
population. MetS was also a significant predictor for
mortality over the 7-year follow-up, after adjusting for
other demographic and clinical variables (hazard ratio: 1.46,
95% CI: 1.16­1.84). Slight and moderate alcohol consump-
tion has been found to be associated with lower cardiovas-
cular risk, possibly through beneficial alterations in HDL
cholesterol and blood pressure (32).
The importance of MetS from a clinical and public health
perspective may be greatest in its predictive value for
cardiovascular disease or diabetes (1) and the serious
implications for the U.S. health care cost (17). All five
components of MetS can be easily evaluated in the clinical
setting (6). Knowledge of the impact of MetS, according to
the standard definitions of cardiovascular and overall
mortality in the general population, is crucial for developing
public health policy and clinical guidelines for its preven-
tion and treatment (1). Therefore, an important aspect
of identifying features of MetS in Mexican-American
elderly persons is to recognize this risk and to initiate
early and appropriate treatment to minimize the risk of
cardiovascular diseases.
There were several limitations in this study. First, we
mainly used self-reported data from older Mexican
Americans with no clinical evaluations. However, the self-
reported approach is a commonly used methodology in
epidemiological research (33) and has been generally
documented to provide reasonable information on de-
mographic and health-related problems including heart
attack (33­35). Second, we did not have laboratory-based
information on triglyceride and/or HDL cholesterol levels,
which are the other two criteria of the five characteristics of
MetS. Although the diagnosis of this syndrome can be made
if any three of the five characteristics are met (20,23,24), our
estimate of MetS without these two characteristics is
underascertained. Finally, the study findings from this
Mexican-American sample may not be generalizable to
other populations because we used only a subgroup of the
original sample.
Conclusion
Eleven percent of Mexican-American elderly persons had
MetS, which was significantly associated with increased risk
of heart attack and mortality over the 7-year follow-up.
Prevention, better control of diabetes and high blood
pressure, and programs for exercise and weight reduction
seem important to improve health and to reduce mortality.
