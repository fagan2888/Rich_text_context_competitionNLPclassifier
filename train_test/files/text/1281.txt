Background--Increased serum C-reactive protein (CRP) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Previous
studies have suggested that genetic variation within the CRP gene is associated with serum CRP.
Methods and Results--We genotyped CRP genetic variants in 7159 individuals from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). NHANES III is American population-based sample linked to hundreds
of phenotypes, including CRP; however, the CRP assay used in this survey is not a high-sensitivity CRP assay, and 65%
of participants (n4679) had CRP measurements at or below the level of detection. Despite these limitations, we
identified specific CRP single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes associated with serum CRP levels in
the general population. Two variants were associated with increased levels of serum CRP: SNP rs3093058 (in linkage
disequilibrium with a CRP promoter SNP rs3093062) in the non-Hispanic black sample and the triallelic promoter SNP
rs3091244 in the non-Hispanic black and Mexican American samples. Two other SNPs were associated with decreased
levels of serum CRP in either the non-Hispanic black (rs1205 and rs2808630) or Mexican American (rs1205) samples.
Three haplotypes inferred from 7 SNPs (ATTGCGA, TTAGCGA, and AAAGAGA) were associated (P0.01) with
increased levels of serum CRP in the non-Hispanic black sample; 2 haplotypes (ATTGCGA and AAAGCGA) were
associated (P0.05) with increased levels in the Mexican American sample; and 1 haplotype (AAAGCGA) was
associated (P0.03) with increased levels in the non-Hispanic white sample. Post hoc analysis suggests that the AA
genotype of the triallelic SNP rs3091244, after adjustment for covariates, was associated with prevalent coronary heart
disease in the non-Hispanic white population sample.
Conclusions--Genetic variation within CRP is associated with serum CRP levels in the general population and may be
associated with prevalent coronary heart disease. (Circulation. 2006;114:2458-2465.)

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of
death in the United States1 and is a significant source of
morbidity and economic burden in the general population.
Genes that affect lipid concentrations or are involved in
inflammation have long been suspected to be involved in the
development of CHD.2 Until recently,3,4 candidate gene
association studies have mostly failed to identify a consistent
relationship between genetic variation and the development
of CHD.5,6 The lack of a consistent association could be
accounted for by several factors, including genetic heteroge-

neity, unaccounted environmental factors, and inadequate sample
size. In addition, most early studies examined a single genetic
polymorphism within a candidate gene, a design that assumes that
the polymorphism under study is directly involved in the expression
of the phenotype or is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the
polymorphism responsible for a proportion of the phenotype.7
To overcome the limitations afflicting most genetic asso-
ciation studies, we applied candidate gene variation data to

7000 DNAs available for study from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).
NHANES is a series of cross-sectional surveys designed to
provide national statistics on the health and nutritional status
of the US noninstitutionalized population. NHANES III,
conducted between 1988 and 1994, included DNA collection
in the second phase of the survey (1991­1994). This study is
now one of the largest American population-based collections
of DNAs linked to an extensive battery of phenotypic and
demographic data available. Thus, DNA from NHANES III,
when coupled with high-throughput sequencing and genotyp-
ing technologies, is an ideal and powerful resource for
present-day genetic association studies.
We focus our present investigation on the factors that
significantly influence serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels,
both genetic and environmental, in NHANES III. CRP is an
independent risk factor for CHD,8­10 and recent evidence
suggests that lowering CRP levels reduces the rate of athero-
sclerosis progression11 and decreases the risk of recurrent
cardiovascular events.12 Given its growing importance in
potentially predicting and/or preventing cardiovascular
events, identifying the genetic variants that significantly
affect CRP levels is an important step in understanding a
possible target for CHD prevention. By combining NHANES
III with strategies to represent common genetic variation
within the CRP gene,13 we can report here the significant
association of genetic variants within CRP and CRP levels in
NHANES III. We also estimate the proportion of CRP
variance explained by CRP single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and haplotypes in a population-based setting and
provide evidence that at least 1 SNP (rs3091244) may be
associated with prevalent CHD.
Methods
Participants
NHANES III is a nationally representative sample of noninstitution-
alized individuals surveyed between 1988 and 1994 by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC). Ascertainment and survey design
have been previously described.14,15 Briefly, NHANES III is a
complex, multistaged survey that oversampled minorities (non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans), children, and the elderly.
Sample weights are provided for each individual included in the
survey to correct for nonresponse and to correct for the fact that each
individual was not selected for the survey with equal probability.
Participants were asked to complete a household interview and a
physical examination in the Mobile Examination Center. If the
participant could not visit the Mobile Examination Center, a special
home physical examination was arranged.
DNA from the genetic component of the NHANES survey was
generated using cell lines created from blood samples of participants
12 years of age during NHANES III phase 2 (1991­1994). The
total number of participants from NHANES III phase 2 was 16 530.
The sample weights were recalculated using previously described
methods16 for the 7159 participants for whom DNA was available to
avoid nonresponse bias. The present study was approved by the CDC
Ethics Review Board and the University of Washington Human
Subjects Committee.
Laboratory Measures
CRP was measured in NHANES III participants using a modification
of the Behring latex-enhanced CRP assay (Behring Diagnostics,
Westwood, Mass) as previously described.17,18 Glucose was mea-
sured using a modified hexokinase enzymatic method. Total choles-
terol and triglycerides were measured enzymatically. High-density
lipoprotein was measured after other lipoproteins were precipitated
using a polyanion/divalent cation. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C
)
was measured using ion exchange chromatography. Details of the
laboratory protocols for each of these measures have been pub-
lished19 and can be found on the CDC National Center for Health
Statistics website at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes3/
cdrom/NCHS/MANUALS/LABMAN.PDF.
Sequencing, tagSNPs, and Genotyping
As previously reported, the CRP gene (6.8 kb), including all exons,
introns, 1.7 kb upstream, and 2.8 kb downstream, was resequenced in
DNA samples available through the Coriell Cell Repositories (http://
locus.umdnj.edu/ccr/) by the SeattleSNPs Program for Genomic
Applications (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) for genetic
variation discovery in 23 and 24 Americans of European and African
ancestry, respectively.20,21 Overall, we detected 31 SNPs, with 29 in
the African-American sample and 12 in the European-American
sample.20,21 All SNPs and genotypes from this resequencing effort
are available on the SeattleSNPs website (http://pga.gs.washington.
edu) and dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/).
We used the LDSelect software at default settings (r20.64) to
select tagSNPs from all common variation within CRP (10% minor
allele frequency).13 Because LD varies across different popula-
tions,22,23 tagSNPs were determined for the European- and African-
descent samples separately, and the results were combined to
determine the optimum set of tagSNPs that represent both population
samples. Recent evidence suggests that this optimum set of tagSNPs
also represents common CRP variation in a Mexican sample.21 A
total of 6 tagSNPs were selected for genotyping in CRP: rs3093058,
rs3091244, rs1417938, rs3093066, rs1205, and rs2808630. In addi-
tion to the 6 tagSNPs, we also genotyped rs1800947, a synonymous
SNP (Leu184Leu) previously reported to be associated with CRP
levels,24,25 and 2 newly described nonsynonymous SNPs: Pro133Lys
(rs34200896) and Gly166Glu (rs34340208).21
All 9 SNPs for CRP were genotyped in 7159 NHANES III
samples by a single laboratory. The location of all SNPs and the
allele frequencies are given in Table I of the online Data Supplement.
Seven SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan Assays by Design
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) under standard condi-
tions,26 and 1 SNP (rs1800947) was genotyped using Epoch MGB
Eclipse Probe Systems (Epoch Biosciences, Bothel, Wash). The
triallelic SNP rs3091244 was genotyped as previously described.20
Individuals determined to be heterozygous by TaqMan Assays by
Design for the rare SNP Gly166Glu were confirmed by resequenc-
ing. The overall average genotyping success rate for the NHANES
III samples was 95%. For quality control and quality assurance, two
96-well plates were provided that contained duplicate samples and
no template controls. The genotyping error rate based on the blind
quality control and quality assurance plates was 1%, and there was
no evidence of contamination. All genotypes for NHANES III are
deposited in a database maintained by the NCHS
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/nh3data_genetic.htm).
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were completed using SAS/Genetics 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) and SUDAAN 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, NC). Haplotypes were inferred from tagSNPs using
the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm provided by SAS/
Genetics 9.1, which also provides the probabilities for each individ-
ual's inferred haplotype pair for subsequent regression analyses.
Common haplotypes (5% frequency) were determined from most
likely pair of haplotypes inferred by the EM algorithm and are listed
in supplementary Table II by race/ethnicity.
When appropriate, variables were transformed using the natural
log to create a more normal distribution. Univariate and multiple
regressions were performed in which ln(CRP) was the dependent
variable. NHANES III participants with CRP levels below the limit
of detection were coded as having a CRP level of 0.21 mg/dL. Most
covariates included in the model were previously reported in the

literature as associated with CRP levels.17,18,20,27­30 The following
variables are treated as continuous variables in the present study:
age, total cholesterol (mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein (mg/dL),
triglycerides (mg/dL), glucose (mg/dL), glycosylated hemoglobin,
systolic blood pressure (mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg),
and body mass index (kg/m2). Total cholesterol serves as a proxy for
low-density lipoprotein because it was not available for all partici-
pants. In addition, glycosylated hemoglobin is used rather than the
glucose tolerance test because the latter was performed only on the
morning samples of participants who fasted.31 Smoking status was
coded as a categorical variable in which current smokers were
individuals who answered "yes" to the question, "Do you smoke
cigarettes now?" or who had cotinine levels 15 ng/mL. Alcohol
consumption was coded as a categorical variable (135 drinks per
week, 235 drinks per week. Prevalent CHD was determined by
self-reported myocardial infarction or angina pectoris and treated as
a categorical variable. Education was defined as having 0 to 8, 9 to
12, or 12 years of education and was treated as an ordinal variable.
Self-described race/ethnicity was classified as non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, and other.
For all regression analyses, pregnant women were excluded
(n130) because pregnancy elevates CRP levels.32,33 For the non-
CRP model, all variables listed above were allowed to enter the
model for the multivariate regression. We also included interaction
terms (gender-by-triglycerides and gender-by­diastolic blood pres-
sure). We excluded glucose because this variable had a substantial
amount of missing data in NHANES III because of fasting require-
ments. Systolic blood pressure was excluded because this measure,
although significant, did not contribute substantially to the model.
Probability values also were calculated using the Satterthwaite
method. The Taylor series was implemented for the variance
estimation method, and standard errors were calculated using a
robust method.34
Genetic covariates were added to the model in 3 different ways:
dominant (genotypes coded as 0 or 1, where 0 is homozygous for the
major allele and 1 is heterozygous plus homozygous for the minor
allele), general genotype (all genotypes), or haplotypes (7 tagSNPs
phased). Models including SNPs as covariates are reported for each
individual tagSNP (except for rs34200896 and rs34340208, the latter
of which had 5 heterozygous individuals identified) adjusted for
non-CRP covariates. For the model including haplotypes, we used
the probabilities of correct haplotype inference provided by the EM
algorithm to adjust for haplotype uncertainty in the model. There-
fore, each haplotype was considered a continuous variable to account
for the uncertainty in haplotype inference by the EM algorithm.
Because haplotypes inferred from the same tagSNPs were found to
be associated with CRP levels in a previous report,20 we chose to
include the same major 8 haplotypes (H1 through H8) in the models
in an attempt to replicate and further define these associations using
our data set. To test for associations between prevalent CHD and
CRP tagSNPs and haplotypes, logistic regressions were performed
after adjustment for covariates, including CRP levels.
All regression models, including genetic covariates, were stratified
by race/ethnicity for 2 reasons. First, tests for effect modification
between the race/ethnicity and CRP SNP covariates were significant
for all tagSNPs except rs1417938 (P0.055). Furthermore, race/
ethnicity is significant in all models when included as a covariate in
the multivariate regressions (data not shown). Second, stratification
by race/ethnicity takes into account differing population demography
and history that ultimately affect the structure of LD across the
human genome.22,23 Because SNPs were chosen for genotyping on
the basis of r2, any resulting association must be interpreted within
the context of a population with a population history or demography
similar to that from which the original tagSNP collection was
derived. When population structure is ignored, the designation
"tagSNP" for the genotyped SNP is no longer valid, and the ability
to trace the association to the putative causal SNP is lost.

Results
The NHANES III phase 2 study participants included in the
genetic portion of the study are described in Table 1.
Approximately 50% of the study participants were female,
and the overall mean age was 40.8 years. The mean CRP level
for NHANES III was 0.40 mg/dL (SE, 0.01 mg/dL). The
majority of CRP levels measured (4679) were below or at the
level of detection. We found that 3.38% of the participants
had self-reported myocardial infarction or angina pectoris.
Univariate regressions were performed for each variable listed
in Table 1. All covariates except alcohol consumption were
significantly associated with serum CRP levels (P0.01). Mul-
tiple regressions were then performed to determine the final
model for non-CRP factors that affect CRP levels in NHANES
III. All variables listed in Table 1 except for glucose, alcohol
consumption, and systolic blood pressure remained in the final
non-CRP model (supplementary Table III). On the basis of
previous findings,20 first-order interactions (gender-by-triglycer-
ides and gender-by­diastolic blood pressure) also were included
in the final model. Collectively, non-CRP factors account for
less than a quarter of the total variance in CRP levels (supple-
mentary Table III; R20.1915).

Regressions were then performed for each SNP defined as an
independent variable and CRP levels as a dependent variable
with adjustment for non-CRP variables. All models were strat-
ified by race/ethnicity (see Methods). Results for the dominant
model are given in Supplementary Tables IV and V. For the
general genotype model, all SNPs except rs1417938 were
significantly associated with serum CRP levels in at least 1 of the
3 population samples after adjustment for non-CRP covariates
(Table 2 and supplementary Table V).
Two notable associations were observed for SNP rs3093058
and rs3091244, both of which were associated with increased
levels of CRP. Specifically, for rs3093058, the AT genotype was
significantly associated (P0.0001) with increased levels of
CRP compared with the AA referent genotype in the non-
Hispanic black sample. For the triallelic rs3091244, several
genotypes were significantly associated with increased levels of
serum CRP levels in the non-Hispanic black (AA, TT, AT, CT;
P0.01) and Mexican American (TT, CT; P0.05) samples
compared with the referent CC genotype (Table 2).
We also identified 2 tagSNPs, rs1205 and rs2808630, that
were significantly associated with decreased CRP levels in the
non-Hispanic black and Mexican American samples (P0.05;
Table 2). The significant associations for tagSNPs rs1800947
and rs3093066 are based on very small sample sizes (n5) and
therefore may be reliable. Mean CRP levels by genotype for all
7 tagSNPs are given in supplementary Table VI.
Because the single SNP regressions demonstrated that multi-
ple sites within the CRP gene significantly affect CRP levels,
haplotypes were inferred to capture possible allelic associations.
A total of 8 haplotypes (H1 through H8) were included in the
model, with the most common haplotype across the 3 popula-
tions (ACAGCGA; H2) as the referent. Rare haplotypes were
coded in aggregate as H9. The resulting models suggest that 4
haplotypes were significantly associated with increased serum
CRP levels after adjustment for non-CRP variables: haplotypes
ATTGCGA (H5), TTAGCGA (H6), and AAAGAGA (H8) in
the non-Hispanic black sample; haplotypes ATTGCGA (H5)
and AAAGCGA (H7) in the Mexican American sample; and
haplotype AAAGCGA (H7) in the non-Hispanic white sample
(Table 3 and supplementary Table VII). Compared with the
non-CRP models for the non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, and Mexican American samples (R2  0.1858, 0.2039,
and 0.1923, respectively), models with the addition of haplo-
types experienced only a small increase in the proportion of
variation of CRP levels explained (R20.1889, 0.2324, and
0.2039, respectively). For comparison, models including haplo-

types but excluding body mass index as a covariate (R20.1519,
0.1752, and 0.1568, respectively) suggest that CRP genetic
variants contribute less to the variance of observed CRP levels
compared with non-CRP variables in all 3 population samples
studied here.
Given that increased CRP levels are associated with an
increased risk for CHD8­10 and given that we have identified
CRP SNPs and haplotypes associated with CRP levels, we
performed logistic regressions in a post hoc analysis to deter-
mine whether CRP SNPs or haplotypes are associated with
prevalent CHD in NHANES III. In multivariate analyses, the
triallelic SNP rs3091244 had the most striking association with
prevalent CHD. After adjustment for non-CRP covariates, the
AA genotype was associated with prevalent CHD (odds ratio
[OR], 30.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.26 to 278.08)
compared with the CC referent genotype in the non-Hispanic
white population sample (P0.0043; supplementary Table
VIII). Surprisingly, the association of the AT genotype with
prevalent CHD was in the opposite direction (OR, 0.10; 95% CI,
0.02 to 0.57) in the same population sample (P0.0115; sup-
plementary Table VIII). These associations, however, should be
interpreted with caution because the number of cases with the
AA or AT genotype (each n5) compared with the referent CC
genotype (n52) for rs3091244 in the non-Hispanic white
population sample was very small. Finally, we identified only 1
other association among CRP tagSNP with prevalent CHD:
rs1800947 in the Mexican American population sample
(P0.0323; supplementary Table VIII). Compared with the
referent GG genotype, the CG genotype at rs1800947 was
associated with decreased prevalent CHD (OR, 0.11; 95% CI,
0.01 to 0.81). No haplotypes were significantly associated with
prevalent CHD (data not shown).
Discussion
Consistent with previous reports,20,35­39 we demonstrate that
both specific CRP SNPs and haplotypes are associated with
serum CRP levels in the general population. Specifically, tag-
SNP rs3093058 was associated with increased levels of CRP in
the non-Hispanic black population, whereas 2 SNPs were
associated with decreased levels of CRP in the non-Hispanic
black (rs1205 and rs2808630) and Mexican American popula-
tions (rs1205). Genotypes for the triallelic SNP rs3091244 were
associated with increased levels of serum CRP in the non-
Hispanic black and Mexican American samples and were
associated with prevalent CHD in the non-Hispanic white
population sample. SNP rs1800947 was not associated with
serum CRP but was associated with decreased prevalent CHD in
the Mexican American population sample.
The association between tagSNPs and CRP levels could
represent a direct causal relationship or an indirect relationship

that serves as a proxy for the true causal SNP. The latter situation
is more likely for tagSNP rs3093058; the former situation is
more likely for the triallelic rs3091244. SNP rs3093058 is in LD
with other CRP SNPs (rs3093061, rs3093062, rs3093068, and
rs3093076). SNP rs3093062 and rs3091244 lie within an evo-
lutionarily conserved region of the CRP promoter and are
predicted to alter a transcription factor E box binding ele-
ment.20,40 Furthermore, in vitro assays have demonstrated the
functional significance of rs3093062 and rs3091244 in the
promoter region of CRP.20,40
The functional significance of the association with the other
SNPs in CRP (rs1800947, rs1205, and rs2808630) is more
difficult to understand. SNP rs1205 tags only itself and is located
distal to the 3 untranslated region of CRP and in the MLT1K
repeat. SNP rs2808630 also is located distal to the 3 untrans-
lated region and is in LD with SNP rs2794521 in the non-
Hispanic white and Mexican American samples. None of these
tagSNPs (or their associated SNPs) occur in an evolutionarily
conserved region (http://ecrbrowswer.dcode.org); thus, their
functional significance remains obscure.
In contrast to the above SNPs, the synonymous SNP
rs1800947 lies in an exon (Leu184Leu in exon 2) and, as
expected, in an evolutionarily conserved region of CRP. Unlike
the rare nonsynonymous CRP SNPs predicted to alter protein
function,21,35 SNP rs1800947 is not predicted to alter protein
function. Many reports in the literature,20,24,25,35,39,41 but not
all,37,42­44 suggest that the C allele of SNP rs1800947 is
associated with decreased CRP levels in European-descent
populations. We did not identify an association with the C allele
at rs1800947 and decreased serum CRP; however, we did
identify an association with decreased prevalent CHD and the
CG genotype in the Mexican American population. SNP
rs1800947 is not in LD with any other CRP SNP. Furthermore,
examination of extended LD using the Perlegen data set45 for
European Americans identified only 1 intergenic
SNP (rs12049404) in LD with SNP rs1800947 (r20.40) within
a 100-kb region proximal and distal to the CRP locus (data not
shown). Very few examples of functional synonymous SNPs
exist in the literature46,47; however, given that no other SNP is in
strong LD to rs1800947 in at least the European-descent popu-
lation, it may be that this presumably silent SNP is functional.
Four haplotypes also were significantly associated with CRP
levels: ATTGCGA, TTAGCGA, AAAGCGA, and AAA-
GAGA. These haplotypes are identical to haplotypes H5, H6,
H7, and H8 described by Carlson et al,20 who reported that all
were associated with increased CRP levels in the Coronary
Artery Risk Development In young Adults (CARDIA) study.
Here, all 4 haplotypes also are associated with increased levels
of serum CRP (Table 3). Compared with a common haplotype
observed in all population samples (the referent ACAGCGA),
all 4 haplotypes differ by 2 SNPs: rs3091244 (A and T alleles)
and rs1205 (G allele). Three of these haplotypes also differed
from the referent haplotype by 3 other SNPs: rs1417938 (H5),
rs3093058 (H6), and rs3093066 (H8). It is interesting to note
that the AA genotype for rs3091244 is not associated with
increased levels of CRP in the non-Hispanic white sample
(P0.0770; Table 2), whereas H7 containing the A allele at
rs3091244 is associated with increased CRP levels in the same
population (Table 3). Although associations between CRP vari-
ants and CRP levels could be identified by genotyping
rs3091244 alone, these results underscore the importance of
modeling both SNP and haplotype associations because neither
approach alone is sufficient to identify as many of the genetic
variants as possible that contribute significantly to the variance
of the phenotype for different populations.
Although the present study has been successful in identifying
genetic variants that contribute to CRP levels in the general
population, the overall contribution of these variants is small
compared with already known contributors such as body mass
index. The variance for CRP levels explained by CRP haplo-
types is 5% for all population studies here. These estimates are
similar to estimates from other cohorts for CRP haplo-
types.20,35,37,38 In comparison, the estimates for the contribution
of CRP haplotypes are far lower than the recent estimates for
VKORC1 haplotypes, which explain 25% of the variance in
warfarin dosing.48
Despite the fact that the genetic contributions measured here
are very small, the possibility of larger genetic contributions yet
to be discovered is still real because the full CRP genetic model
leaves most of the variance unexplained (80%). In addition,
heritability estimates suggest that 20% to 60% of the variance
in basal CRP levels can be attributable to genetics.43,49­51 CRP is
1 component of a complex acute-phase response that involves
several genes, including its transcriptional regulators IL-6 and
IL1B and the protein kinase C pathway.52,53 Preliminary studies
suggest that polymorphisms in IL650,54 and IL1B55­57 are asso-
ciated with CRP levels, but the associations are somewhat
inconsistent,43,56,58 and the size of the contribution is unclear.
Nevertheless, it may be that genes in these CRP regulatory
pathways have a greater impact on CRP levels in the general
population compared with genetic variants within CRP, warrant-
ing further study of CRP-related pathways in large population-
based surveys such as NHANES III.
The study presented here has several strengths and limitations.
The major strength of the present study is the use of a large,
population-based survey and its uniformly collected laboratory and
examination variables. This comprehensive data set allows exami-
nation of both genetic and environmental variables in several
population samples that contribute to the phenotype of interest.
A limitation is that the measure of CRP is not the high-
sensitivity test now available for investigation. The test used for
NHANES III has a lower limit of 0.21 mg/dL, which makes the
distribution for NHANES III truncated at the lower limit of the
measure. Despite this limitation in phenotype resolution, we
were able to confirm that CRP genetic variants are associated
with serum CRP levels. Another limitation is that CRP levels
were measured only once in this cross-sectional study and could
possibly have changed if a second measurement were taken.
However, on the basis of recent results from CARDIA that
demonstrated that CRP levels are stable when compared at
different time points several years apart,20 we do not anticipate
that a second measurement of CRP levels would be significantly
different than the original measurement in NHANES III.
Finally, only prevalent CHD could be measured in this
cross-sectional study, and the total number of reported events
among NHANES III participants was low (n250), decreasing
our power to identify meaningful associations. Surprisingly, we
were able to identify a significant association between the

triallelic SNP rs3091244 and prevalent CHD in the non-
Hispanic white population sample after adjusting for covariates
in a post hoc analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first report suggesting an association between prevalent CHD
and rs3091244. Other reports examining the relationship be-
tween CRP SNPs and prevalent CHD or related phenotypes
either did not genotype rs3091244 directly39,59,60 or did genotype
rs3091244 but did not identify an association.37,38 Replication of
this finding, particularly in cohorts in whom incident CHD can
be measured, is necessary to confirm the rs3091244 association
and its potential usefulness in predicting new CHD events.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase plasma protein usually associated with generalized inflammation or infection.
More recent evidence suggests that increased levels of CRP in individuals are associated with future cardiovascular events
independent of traditional risk factors (eg, lipid profiles). This report assesses whether genetic variation within the CRP
gene contributes to the distribution of CRP levels in Americans. Previous studies have suggested that specific genetic
variants called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CRP gene are associated with increased levels of CRP;
however, few of these studies had a large sample size and examined SNPs from the entire gene. Using data from the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), we genotyped 7 CRP SNPs in 7000 DNAs and
confirmed previous findings that specific CRP SNPs are associated with either increased or decreased CRP levels in this
representative American population sample. Although specific CRP SNPs are associated with CRP levels, their
contribution is small compared with other factors known to affect CRP levels such as body mass index. It remains to be
seen whether these CRP SNPs are associated with cardiovascular events in the clinical setting. A post-hoc analysis was
performed to test whether the CRP SNPs were associated with reported myocardial infarctions. Although the results
suggest that an association may exist, further study is needed, given the limited number of events reported in NHANES
III.
