SUICIDE ACCOUNTS FOR 1.5% OF
the global burden of disease,
whichrepresents20millionyears
of healthy life lost due to prema-
ture death or disability.1 Among all
Americans, suicide is the 11th leading
cause of death and the rates range across
specific demographic subgroups (eg, it
is the 8th leading cause of death among
Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Island-
ers, and men).2 Across race and sex, the
elderly, particularly white men aged 85
years and older have the highest sui-
cide rate (51.6/year per 100 000 popu-
lation).3 The risk of dying from suicide
in2003wasmorethandoubleforwhites
(13.0/100 000) than for blacks (5.3/
100 000).4 In recent years, suicide and
nonfatal suicidal behavior have emerged
as crucial health issues for blacks, par-
ticularly among older adolescents and
young adults.5-7 According to a recent
Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion report, the prevalences of at-
temptedsuicideforwhiteandblackhigh
school students (7.3% and 7.6%, respec-
tively) were roughly equal.8 Although
suicide has traditionally been viewed as
a problem that affects more whites, the
rates of suicide among blacks have in-
creased significantly since the mid
1980s.9 Aprecipitousincreaseintherate

havior12 among younger blacks has re-
ducedUSracialdisparitiesinsuicidalbe-
haviors. The difference in suicide rates
between whites and blacks aged 15 to 24
years narrowed from a ratio of 1.7 in
1980 to 1.4 in 2003.3
Despite increasing recognition of
the public health significance of these
trends, more comprehensive data on
the occurrence of suicidal ideation and
attempts are needed to further the
understanding of whether the preven-
tion and treatment of antecedents to
suicide are effective in reducing risk
among this population. Given that the
US black population is projected to
double by 2050,13 and that suicidal
thoughts and behaviors are among the
strongest predictors of suicide,14

Context Lack of data on the lifetime prevalence and age at onset of suicide ide-
ation, plans, and attempts among blacks in the United States limits the creation and
evaluation of interventions to reduce suicide among black Americans.
Objective To examine the prevalence and correlates of suicide ideation, planning,
and attempts across 2 ethnic classifications of blacks in a nationally representative sample.
Design, Setting, and Participants Data are from the National Survey of Ameri-
can Life, a national household probability sample of 5181 black respondents aged 18
years and older, conducted between February 2001 and June 2003, using a slightly
modified adaptation of the World Health Organization World Mental Health version
of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Bivariate and survival analyses
were used to delineate patterns and correlates of nonfatal suicidal behavior.
Main Outcome Measures Self-reports of lifetime suicide ideation, planning, and
attempts.
Results Survey respondents, categorized as African Americans and Caribbean Ameri-
cans, reported lifetime prevalence of 11.7% for suicide ideation and 4.1% for at-
tempts. Among the respondents who reported ideation, 34.6% transitioned to mak-
ing a plan and only 21% made an unplanned attempt. Among 4 ethnic-sex groups,
the 7.5% lifetime prevalence for attempts among Caribbean black men was the high-
est among black Americans. The greatest risk of progressing to suicide planning or
attempt among ideators occurred within the first year after ideation onset. Blacks at
higher risk for suicide attempts were in younger birth cohorts, less educated, Midwest
residents, and had 1 or more Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition disorders.
Conclusions This study documents the burden of nonfatal suicidality among US blacks,
notably Caribbean black men, and individuals making planned attempts. Advancing
research on the transition from suicide planning to attempt is vital to the efficacy of
health care professionals' ability to screen blacks at risk for suicide.

lation is an important public health
objective. Generating more reliable
and more extensive scientific data on
nonfatal suicidal behaviors is a critical
first step in developing and testing
preventive interventions aimed at
reducing both suicide morbidity and
mortality.
Reports from the Institute of Medi-
cine and US surgeon general have high-
lighted the need for nationally repre-
sentative epidemiological data on the
occurrence of suicidal thoughts and at-
tempts.5,7,15 There is no single primary
data source for nationally representa-
tive information on nonfatal suicidal be-
havior.5 Reliable population estimates of
such behaviors are hampered by the ab-
sence of centralized data registries and
consistent definitions of suicide across
regions.16-18 Current estimates of non-
fatal suicidal behavior in the United
States are derived from either ongoing
surveillance systems or epidemiologi-
cal surveys reporting population-based
prevalence estimates for suicidal
thoughts and attempts.19,20 These sys-
tems provide valuable information, but
they are limited because they provide
little to no race-specific information.5
The most recent epidemiologic stud-
ies, the National Comorbidity Survey
and the National Comorbidity Survey
Replication,19,20 provide national preva-
lence estimates of suicide ideation, plan-
ning, and attempts, but not by race or
ethnicity. The most recent data on black
adult nonfatal suicidal behaviors are
from the National Institute of Mental
Health's Epidemiologic Catchment Area
study for 1980-1984, which found a
2.3% lifetime estimate of attempted sui-
cide among US blacks.21 These studies
lack information on the onset of sui-
cideideation,prevalenceofsuicideplan-
ning, and data on the correlates of sui-
cide-related behaviors among blacks.
National estimates of the lifetime preva-
lence and correlates of suicide ide-
ation, planning, and attempts among
blacks of African American and Carib-
bean ethnicity in the United States are
reported herein for the first time using
the recently collected National Survey
of American Life (NSAL).
METHODS
Population and Data Collection
The NSAL is part of the National In-
stitute of Mental Health Collaborative
Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys ini-
tiative that includes 3 nationally rep-
resentative surveys: the NSAL, the Na-
tional Comorbidity Survey Replication,
and the National Latino and Asian
American Study.22 The NSAL is a na-
tionally representative household sur-
vey of 3570 African Americans, 1621
blacks of Caribbean descent (Carib-
bean blacks), and 891 non-Hispanic
whites, aged 18 years and older.23 The
non-Hispanic whites, however, were
not administered the full interview and
were not asked the suicidality ques-
tions. Thus, this report focuses on the
African American and Caribbean black
samples. The African American sample,
the largest segment of the NSAL core
sample, is nationally representative of
households located in the 48 contigu-
ous states with at least 1 black adult
aged 18 years or older who did not iden-
tify ancestral ties in the Caribbean. The
Caribbean black sample was selected
from 2 area probability sample frames:
265 were selected from the house-
holds in the core sample, while 1356
were selected from an area probability
sample of housing units from geo-
graphic areas with a relatively high den-
sity of persons of Caribbean descent
(more than 10% of the population).24
The NSAL analysis weights for the Af-
rican American and Caribbean black
samples were designed to provide popu-
lation representation for these popula-
tions in the continental US states.
Inthisstudy,AfricanAmericanisused
to describe individuals who self-
identified as black but did not identify
ancestral ties to the Caribbean. Carib-
bean blacks are individuals who self-
identifiedasblackandindicatedthatthey
were from a country included on a list
ofCaribbean-areacountriespresentedby
the interviewers, or who specified that
at least 1 of their parents or grandpar-
ents was born in a Caribbean-area
country. Most (86%) interviews were
conductedface-to-faceusingacomputer-
assisted instrument and lasted an aver-
age of 2 hours 20 minutes. The remain-
ing interviews (14%) were conducted
partiallyorentirelybytelephone.Respon-
dents interviewed by telephone tended
to be slightly more educated. No other
significant differences in the main out-
comesandothervariablesofinterestwere
found between the 2 interview modes.
Data were collected between February
2001andJune2003.Theoverallresponse
ratewas71.5%:70.0%forwhites,70.9%
for African Americans, and 79.3% for
Caribbean blacks. These rates were cal-
culated using the American Association
for Public Opinion Research response
rate 3 method,25 which includes in the
numerator the number of completed
interviews, the number of originally
sampled households in the denomina-
tor, excludes known ineligible house-
holds, and is adjusted for the estimated
proportion of eligible households that
interviewerswereunabletocontact.The
weighting class method was used to
adjustthedatafornonresponsebias.26 For
allrace/ethnicsamples,additionalNSAL
weightsweredesignedtocorrectfordis-
proportionate sampling and for popula-
tion representation across various
sociodemographic characteristics.24
Descriptive analyses applying these
weights yield statistics nationally repre-
sentative of the populations and sub-
populations of interest.
Recruitment and Consent
After introductory letters and study bro-
chures were mailed to sample house-
holds, a trained interviewer contacted
each sample housing unit in person to
further explain the study and asked an
adult household informant additional
questions (eg, age, sex, race, and His-
panic and Caribbean ancestry status of
each household member) to identify a
subset of household members eligible
to be selected as the NSAL respon-
dent. The Kish27 procedure for objec-
tive respondent selection was used to
randomly designate 1 of the eligible
adults as the NSAL respondent. The in-
terviewers then obtained oral consent
and completed the interview, or
scheduled it for a later time. Oral in-
stead of written consent was obtained

bidity population surveys.19,20 For their
participation, each respondent was
given $50. The institutional review
board of the University of Michigan ap-
proved the recruitment, consent, and
data collection procedures.
Suicidal Behavior
Suicidality is assessed in its own
section of the World Mental Health
Composite International Diagnostic
Interview (WMH-CIDI) by a series of
questionsaboutlifetimesuicidalbehav-
iors including ideation, planning, and
attempts.28 Respondents were screened
intothesuicidalitysectionoftheWMH-
CIDI if they answered affirmatively to
the question "Have you ever seriously
thought about committing suicide?"
These respondents are said to have
engaged in suicidal ideation and will be
referred to as ideators in this report,
while those answering negatively will
be referred to as non-ideators. Only the
ideators went on to answer questions
to determine if they ever made plans to
commit suicide ("Have you ever made
a plan for committing suicide?") and if
they ever attempted suicide ("Have you
ever attempted suicide?"). Respon-
dents answering affirmatively to any of
these 3 questions were asked to pro-
vide the age when they first experi-
enced the given outcome. To gain a bet-
ter understanding of the progression
fromideationtoattempt,wealsoexam-
ined 3 conditional associations corre-
sponding to different pathways indi-
viduals may follow from suicidal
ideationtoattemptedsuicide:plangiven
ideation, attempt given ideation but no
plan, and finally attempt given ide-
ation and a plan.20 The suicide intent

Psychiatric Diagnosis and
Treatment Experience
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition29
(DSM-IV) World Mental Health Com-
posite International Diagnostic Inter-
view (WMH-CIDI), a fully structured
diagnostic interview, was used to as-
sess a wide range of serious mental dis-
orders and conditions, including sui-
cidality. The psychiatric disorders in the
NSAL are slightly modified versions of
those developed for the World Mental
Health project initiated in 200030 and
used in the National Comorbidity
Survey Replication.31 We present and
discuss risks for various suicidal be-
haviors associated with the mental dis-
orders assessed in the NSAL: (1) mood
(major depressive disorder, dys-
thymia, bipolar I & II disorders); (2)
anxiety (panic disorder, agoraphobia,
social phobia, generalized anxiety dis-
order, probable obsessive compulsive
disorder, posttraumatic stress disor-
der); (3) substance (alcohol abuse, al-
cohol dependence, drug abuse, drug de-
pendence); (4) disorders usually
diagnosed in childhood (separation
anxiety, oppositional defiant disor-
der, conduct disorder, attention deficit/
hyperactivity disorder); and (5) eat-
ing (anorexia, bulimia, binge-eating).
We also examined suicidal respon-
dents' treatment experiences for men-
tal disorders assessed in the NSAL. All
respondents were asked if they had con-
tact with anyone from an extensive list
of treatment providers for problems
with their emotions, nerves, mental
health, or use of alcohol or drugs in
their lifetime. Health care treatment
providers were categorized into a men-
tal health sector (psychiatrists, psy-
chologists, counselors and social work-
ers seen in mental health settings, other
mental health professionals, mental
health hotlines) and a general medical
sector (general practitioners, family
physicians, nurses, occupational thera-
pists, and other health professionals).
A nonÂ­health care sector included
the use of human services (religious
and spiritual advisors, counselors and
social workers seen in nonÂ­mental
health settings) and complementary-
alternative treatments (herbalists, chi-
ropractors, spiritualists, self-help
groups, Internet support groups). Life-
time service use was defined as mak-
ing at least 1 visit to a service provider
prior to the respondent's interview.
Sociodemographic Correlates
We investigated sociodemographic fac-
tors to ascertain groups potentially at el-
evated risk of suicidal behaviors. Socio-
demographic correlates included
ethnicity (African American and Carib-
bean black), sex, highest level of educa-
tion (less than high school, high school
graduate, some college, college gradu-
ate), marital status (married, previ-
ouslymarried,nevermarried),birthyear
cohort (1939 or before, 1940-1954,
1955-1964, 1965-1974, 1975 or after),
and region (Northeast, Midwest, South,
and West Census regions).32

RESULTS
Prevalence
TABLE 1 shows the characteristics of the
survey participants with the weighted
distributions of the sociodemographic
characteristics. TABLE 2 presents the es-
timated lifetime prevalences of the sui-
cidal behaviors. The estimated life-
time prevalence of suicidal ideation and
attempts among blacks in the United
States was 11.7% and 4.1%, respec-
tively. Among the ideators, 34.6% made
a suicide plan. Statistically significant
differences (P.05) were found be-
tween men and women, with attempts
being more prevalent for women, 4.9%,
than for men, 3.1%. An ethnicity-by-
sex analysis revealed the prevalence of
suicide attempts was highest for Carib-
bean black men (7.5%), followed by Af-
rican American women (5.0%). Carib-
bean black women had the lowest
prevalence of attempts (2.7%), while at-
tempts were only slightly more preva-
lent for African American men (2.74%).
Of attempters, 63.6% reported at-
temptingonlyonce,18.3%reported2at-
tempts, 11.6% reported 3 attempts, and
6.5% reported 4 or more suicide at-
tempts. Attempters were asked to de-
scribe the nature of their intent. Among
the attempters, 41.7% endorsed the item
"I made a serious attempt to kill myself
and it was only luck that I did not suc-
ceed." Another 13.7% of attempters en-
dorsed "I tried to kill myself, but knew
that the method was not fool proof"
while 44.6% endorsed "My attempt was
a cry for help. I did not intend to die."
Reported Age at Onset
Distributions
FIGURE 1 shows the smoothed hazard
curves for the reported initial onset of
suicide ideation, planning, and at-
tempt for the entire sample. These
curves indicate that the highest risk of
initial onset of these behaviors occurs
during the late teens and early 20s. No-
tably, the risk of making a suicide at-
tempt is greater than the risk of mak-
ing a suicide plan during this age period
suggesting that nonplanned, impul-
sive attempts are more common than
planned attempts until respondents
reach their early 20s. FIGURE 2 shows
how soon after initial ideation onset re-
spondents progressed to more serious
suicidal behaviors. The figure shows
that the greatest risk of progressing to
plan formation and to attempt among
ideators occurred within the first year
after ideation onset. Risk of attempt was
substantially greater in the presence of
a plan. While attempts were almost ex-
clusively confined to the first year af-
ter ideation onset in the absence of a
plan, individuals with a plan contin-
ued to make initial suicide attempts for
up to 35 years after first onset of ide-
ation. The mean time from initial ide-
ation onset to first suicide attempt was
1.39 (SE, 0.47) years with a range of 0
to 35 years; however, 77.3% of attempt-
ers did so within the first year after ide-
ation onset. Within 3 years of ideation

onset, 90% of attempters had made an
attempt, and 95% had made an at-
tempt by the end of the sixth year af-
ter ideation onset.
Based on the prevalence estimates,
which suggested an interaction be-
tween ethnicity and sex, we examine the
hazard curves for first attempts sepa-
rately for each of 4 ethnicity-sex groups
(FIGURE 3). These curves give a more
complete understanding of the preva-
lence rates; specifically, 3 important
findings are evident in Figure 3. First,
Caribbean black males had the high-
est rates of attempt from ages 10 to 34
years, and the age at which they were
most at risk of attempting, approxi-
mately 21 years, was almost 5 years
older than the ages of highest risk for
the 2 female groups. Second, African
American men had a relatively con-
stant low hazard of attempt, but were
actually the group most at risk of at-
tempting after age 34 years. Third, all
groups had peaks of varying magni-
tude in their risks of attempting sui-
cide during adolescence and early adult-
hood; however, the risk of attempt
persisted into older adulthood only for
the 2 African American groups.
Sociodemographic Risk Factors
Risk of a suicide attempt and risk of sui-
cidal ideation were significantly associ-
ated with being born in a recent co-
hort, having a low education level, and
residing in the Midwest region of the
United States (TABLE 3). In addition,
being previously married (eg, divorced
or widowed) was significantly associ-
ated with increased odds of suicidal ide-
ation compared with being married. Al-
though Caribbean black men and
African American women had a higher
prevalenceofsuicideattempts,the4-cat-
egory ethnicity-by-sex variable was not
significantly associated overall with at-
tempted suicide at the P.05 level
(2
3
=5.96; P=.11). The results for birth-
year cohort suggested the presence of a
linear trend for all 5 of the outcomes. In
particular, individuals born in recent co-
horts were significantly more likely to
develop a suicide plan (2
4
=9.66; P.05)
and to attempt suicide (2

=17.92;

The smoothed hazard functions describe the ways in which the onset risks of the 3 suicidal behaviors change
with time. For all behaviors, the highest risk occurs from the teenage years to the mid-twenties. From the mid-
twenties, the risks generally decline gradually with the exception of a slight increase from the mid-forties to
mid-fifties. Notice that the risk of attempting suicide is slightly higher than the risk of making a suicide plan
until approximately age 19 years, when the 2 hazard curves cross. This suggests that nonplanned, impulsive
attempts are more likely than planned attempts up to this point in young adulthood.

The x-axis represents time in years from the first onset of suicidal ideation. The y-axis represents the event-
free survival probability. For example, among ideators with a suicide plan, the probability of not attempting
suicide decreases to less than 50% in the first 2 years after ideation onset. The probability of remaining attempt-
free continues to decrease gradually until 35 years after ideation onset. At this point, only approximately 25%
of individuals who made a suicide plan have not made an attempt, while 75% have attempted. Contrast this
with the ideators who did not make suicide plans. After a sharp decrease in the first year after ideation onset,
the respondents' probability of remaining attempt-free stabilizes at about 80%.

birth-year cohorts were less likely to
make a planned suicide attempt than
wererespondentsintheearliest-bornco-
hort (2

=13.22; P=.01); however, this
applies only to the overall cohort effect
because none of the individual ORs
reached statistical significance. This re-
sult supplements the finding from
Figure 1 that suggested that non-
planned, impulsive attempts are more
common than planned attempts for re-
spondents until their early 20s. Fol-
low-up model-based trend tests con-
firmed the significant linear birth-year
cohort trends for all of the outcomes;
curvilinear trend terms were tested but
noneweresignificant.Respondentswith
fewer than 12 years of formal educa-
tionwere3.64(95%CI,1.63-8.15)times
more likely to attempt suicide than were
individualswith16ormoreyearsofedu-

Southern region of the United States
were less likely to attempt suicide
(2

ticular, respondents residing in the Mid-
west were 2.04 times more likely to at-

Psychiatric Risk Factors
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards
models controlling for all of the socio-
demographic variables included in
Table 3 were used to assess the risks of
engaging in the suicidal behaviors asso-
ciated with the 20 DSM-IV disorders as-
sessedintheNSAL.TABLE 4presentsthe
ORs and 95% CIs for these disorders,
omitting the results for the control vari-
ables. Because 135 models (27 models
for each of the 5 outcomes) were con-
structed for Table 4 with a total of 145
statisticallytestedcomparisons,thePval-
ues of these statistics were adjusted to

method is preferable to controlling for
the family-wise error rate when the mul-
tiple comparisons are not indepen-
dent.37 Although 95% CIs remain unad-
justed,asterisksindicatewhichestimates

more stringent adjusted P values. Re-
spondentswithanyofthe20DSM-IVdis-
orders assessed in the NSAL were 8.2
times (95% CI, 4.77-14.06) more likely
to attempt suicide and almost 5 times
more likely to develop suicidal ideation
(OR,4.96;95%CI,3.48-7.06)thanwere
respondents with no disorder. Having
any disorder was also associated with in-
creased risk among ideators of proceed-
ing to make a suicide plan. All 5 of the
summary variables for the diagnostic
classes(eg,anymooddisorder,anyanxi-
ety disorder) were significantly associ-
atedwithelevatedrisksofattemptingsui-
cide (OR range, 3.15 for any eating
disorderto6.03foranyanxietydisorder).
The effects of comorbidity are pre-
sented at the bottom of Table 4. Hav-
ing 3 or more disorders was strongly as-
sociated with all of the pathways except
for impulsive attempts. Persons with 3
or more disorders were 17 times more
likely (17.13; 95% CI, 9.32-31.47) to
attempt suicide and about 10 times
more likely (9.74; 95% CI, 6.80-
13.95) to develop suicidal ideation than
respondents with no psychiatric disor-
der. Ideators with 3 or more disorders
were more than 2.5 times as likely to
make a suicide plan. The risks of at-
tempts and of ideation are greater for
persons with 1 disorder than for per-
sons with no disorder, and slightly
greater for persons with 2 disorders
than for persons with only 1 disorder.

These smoothed hazard functions describe the ways in which the risk of first suicide attempt changes with
time for the 4 sex-by-ethnicity groups. As in Figure 1, the greatest risk generally occurs during the teenage
years to the mid-twenties. African American men are at notably lower risk of making an attempt than the
other 3 groups until their mid-20s and actually become the group most at risk after approximately age 34
years. Caribbean black men are most at risk up to this age.

*Odds ratios were obtained by exponentiating the coefficients from Cox proportional hazards regression models. The 95% confidence intervals were obtained using a modified method
of balanced repeated replications to adjust for stratification, clustering, and weighting of the data. Each column presents the results from 27 models. Each of these models controlled
for the sociodemographic variables presented in Table 2. In addition, each model contained exactly 1 of the 20 individual disorders, exactly 1 of the 6 summary measures (any disorder,
any mood disorder, etc.), or the set of dummy variables representing the number of comorbid disorders. All disorders were defined without diagnostic hierarchy rules.
The behavioral categories of attempt and ideation present the risks for the unconditional behaviors.
The behavioral categories of plan among ideators, impulsive attempt among ideators without a plan, and planned attempt among ideators with a plan present the risks for the conditional
behaviors.

significance criterion was P.0231. Confidence intervals remain unadjusted. As a result, it is possible for an odds ratio to be nonsignificant by this criterion even though 1.00 lies outside
of the corresponding 95% confidence interval.

up to 35 years after the first onset of ide-
ation. Thus, we report for the first time
important ethnic differences among
blacks in the lifetime prevalence of sui-
cideideation,planning,andattemptsand
the prevalence of mental health service
use among black attempters and ide-
ators. There are no similar data with
which to compare the results obtained
in the NSAL. The reported 4.9% preva-
lenceofattemptedsuicideamongCarib-
beanblacks,however,wasatthehighend
of prevalence rates of attempted suicide
reported in previous general popula-
tion surveys.19-21
The notably higher prevalence of
attempted suicide among black women
isconsistentwithpreviousstudiesofsui-
cidal behaviors. However, the 7.5%
prevalence rate among Caribbean black
men is different from previous findings
for US-based populations that women
uniformlyhavehigherratesofattempted
suicide than men.38 In fact, Caribbean
black men reported the highest rate of
attemptedsuicidefortheUSblackpopu-
lation. The reasons for the unexpected
higherriskforattemptedsuicideamong
Caribbean black men must be exam-
ined in future research. It is important
tounderstandwhetherthisuniquefind-
ing is potentially an example in which
ethnicityispersemoresalientthannativ-
ity, race, and assimilation.
The findings that the risk for at-
tempted suicide is highest in the age
groupof15to24years,andthatyounger
generations of blacks are at signifi-
cantly higher risk of attempted suicide,
are consistent with independent evi-
dence of marked increases in suicide
among younger blacks.6,11,39 Recent re-
search on reasons for higher suicide risk
among younger blacks have suggested
that younger blacks have increased ac-
cesstolethalmethods,40,41 havemorepsy-
chiatric disorders, and may hold accept-
ing attitudes toward suicide.42-44
The relationship between the risk for
suicide attempts and other sociodemo-
graphiccorrelatesisconsistentwithpre-
vious results based on cross-sectional
surveys and clinical or community
samples. For instance, previous re-
search has established that there is an
inverse relationship between educa-
tion and attempted suicide.20 Accord-
ing to our analyses, blacks with less than
a high school education were more
likely to have attempted suicide. Blacks
in the Midwest were at a significantly
higher risk for attempted suicide than
those residing in the South, consistent
with research suggesting that South-
ern residence is a protective factor for
this population.45 Analyses revealed that
marital status, though often found to
be an important correlate,46 was not a
significant predictor of suicide plan-
ning or attempts in these populations.
Consistent with research on other
populations, psychiatric disorders, in-
cluding substance abuse diagnosis47 and
comorbidpsychiatricdisorders,48,49 were
significant predictors of attempted sui-
cide among black ideators. Our analy-
ses showed that ideators with any psy-
chiatricdisorderwere8timesmorelikely
to attempt suicide. Individuals with any
form of anxiety disorder had the high-
estriskofattemptedsuicide,followedby
those with a childhood disorder, those
with a mood disorder, and those with an
eating disorder. The dose-response re-
lationship between the number of psy-
chiatric disorders and attempted sui-
cide is consistent with other cross-
sectional studies and community
epidemiological surveys.20 The finding
thatanxietydisorderisthestrongestpre-
dictor compared with other mental or
substance abuse predictors is inconsis-
tentwithotherstudies,whichfoundthat
depression is often the strongest psychi-
atric risk factor for suicide.14
Suicide often occurs in the context of
a wide range of complex and interre-
latedunderlyingetiologicalfactors.The
NSAL finding that psychiatric comor-
bidity is a significant predictor of sui-
cide attempts over and above the effects
ofindividualdisordersisconsistentwith
previous research on adult suicidal
behavior.20 The greater the number of
psychiatric disorders an individual has,
the higher the risk of attempted sui-
cide.49 According to NSAL data, ide-
ators with 3 or more psychiatric disor-
ders are 17 times more likely to attempt
suicideandtwiceaslikelytoattemptafter
making a plan. In all instances, how-
ever, the ORs for individuals with only
1 disorder and for those with 2 disor-
ders are similar. This suggests the pres-
ence of a threshold, rather than linear,
effect for number of psychiatric disor-
ders. That is, the suicide risks increase

*All prevalence estimates are weighted to be nationally representative of the given subpopulations in the contiguous 48
US states. Standard errors are adjusted for the sampling stratification, clustering, and weighting of the data.
Within each service sector, 2 statistics were statistically significant at the P.0001 level, suggesting a strong asso-
ciation between use within each sector and the 3 groups. Any mental health treatment includes treatment by a psy-
chiatrist, as well as by a nonphysician mental health specialist (eg, psychologist, social worker in a mental health
specialty setting). General medical treatment includes treatment by any nonpsychiatrist physician or a worker in a
general medical setting (eg, nurse in a primary care setting). In addition to including mental health and general medi-
cal treatment, the category of any treatment includes treatment in nonÂ­health care settings including human ser-
vices professionals (eg, religious or spiritual advisors) and complementary-alternative treatments (eg, massage therapy,
chiropractic treatment, or participation in a self-help group).

Limitations
The NSAL findings must be considered
in the context of several important limi-
tations.Theresultsreportedherearelim-
ited by the fact that we do not know the
extent to which cultural factors affected
the willingness of our respondents to
either admit or recall the presence of
symptoms or suicide over their lifetime.
Theresultsmayalsobeaffectedbyrecall
biasassociatedwiththerespondents'age
and mental health status. Also for all
analyses, the results are limited by the
absenceofrespondentscurrentlyininsti-
tutionalsettings(notunusualforahouse-
hold-based survey). The NSAL is cross-
sectional,obtainingretrospectivereports;
thus the prevalence rates are likely to be
lower-bound estimates.20 Research sug-
gests that some DSM-IV diagnoses may
be overestimated using lay-adminis-
tered interviewing, particularly nonaf-
fective psychoses,50,51 but studies have
foundthatestimatesofprevalenceusing
the WMH-CIDI are generally conserva-
tive.52 Finally, our sample of Caribbean
blacksincludesimmigrantswhohavehad
varying lengths of stay in the United
States, as well as persons of Caribbean
ancestry who were born in the United
States with no strong knowledge of or
identification with Caribbean culture.
Despite these constraints, the effect of
most of the noted limitations is to make
our estimates more conservative than
might otherwise be the case. In view of
currentgapsinourunderstandingofthe
risk for suicidal behavior among blacks,
theseconstraintsseemacceptableinlight

diverse sample of black Americans.
CONCLUSIONS
The NSAL provides the first nationally
representativegeneralpopulationdataon
ethnicdifferencesinlifetimesuicideide-
ation, planning, and attempts among
blacks. The NSAL results provide evi-
dence that black Americans have levels
ofsuicidalthoughtandbehaviorsthatare
comparable with the general popula-
tion.Futureresearchshouldcontinueto
further clinicians' understandings of
which black Americans are most at risk
for suicide (intra-group analyses). The
information obtained from these types
of studies is very different from what is
gainedfromexamining,relativetowhites,
which black Americans are most likely
to attempt suicide. These lines of inves-
tigation are both important, but the lat-
tercannotprovidethesamelevelofsub-
population specificity regarding the
suicide risk factors. The higher rates of
attemptedsuicide,notablyamongCarib-
bean black men, and the role of nativity
vs ethnicity needs to be addressed in
future research and considered by clini-
cians when screening, intervening, and
treating black patients. There is a need
to explore whether different immigra-
tion experiences (eg, type of accultura-
tion, trans-migration experiences, spe-
cific origins of immigrants) are
responsible for the higher attempt rates
inCaribbeanblackmen,andifthisresult

explore how black American suicidal

cal resources (eg, social support, con-
nectedness),multiplemeasuresofsocio-
economic status (including material
hardship)andtheaccesstoaswellasthe
timing, duration, and adequacy of treat-
ment for mental disorders.
Physicians have an important role to
play in the prevention of suicide among
black patients, given our results that a
majority of attempters sought care from
a health professional for their emo-
tionalproblemsandaboutathirdsought
care from a general medical profes-
sional specifically. Physicians and men-
tal health professionals should be skilled
in talking with black patients about the
risk for suicide, providing interven-
tions for those at imminent risk for sui-
cidal behavior, and referring patients for
expertassessmentandtreatment.There-
sults of the study should influence cli-
nicians who screen patients for suicide
risk. For instance, clinicians should fo-
cus on modifiable risk factors (eg, anxi-
ety, depression) and should engage
blacks in aggressive treatment in the
high-riskperiodofthefirstyearafteride-
ation onset and continue to observe pa-
tients who attempt suicide after mak-
ingaplan.Cliniciansmustalsoconsider,
when screening blacks, the strong asso-
ciationofDSM-IVdisorderswiththerisk
for suicide attempts, the greater likeli-
hood for young adults to be impulsive,
andforolderadultstoengageinplanned
suicideattempts.Itisalsoimportantthat
black patients at risk for impulsive at-
tempts do not have access to firearms or
medications that can be used to at-
tempt suicide.
