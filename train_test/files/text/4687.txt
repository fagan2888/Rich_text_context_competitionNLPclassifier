These days there is an ongoing debate regarding the replica-
tion problem of priming effects (see for instance, Cesario,
2014; Lermer, Streicher, Sachs, Raue, & Frey, 2016).
Consequently, researchers are called upon to replicate
research findings. This could be done by exact or conceptual
replications, which comprise some variance (for instance,
within the used measures or sample in comparison with the
original study; Stroebe & Strack, 2014). Recently, Lermer,
Streicher, Sachs, Raue, and Frey (2014) have shown that
people's thinking style influences their risk-taking behavior.
In particular, participant's mind-set/construal level (CL)
influences their risk propensity; those that think abstractly
showed an increased risk propensity compared with those
with a concrete mind-set.
In their studies, Lermer and colleagues (2014) referred to
construal level theory (CLT; Trope & Liberman, 2010),
which states that the way people think about events or objects
is subject to the perceived psychological distance ("the sub-
jective experience that something is close or far away from
self, here and now," Trope & Liberman, 2010, p. 440). The
more distant (e.g., in time) a target is perceived, the more
abstract the target representation becomes. Moreover,
abstractly represented targets are perceived as more distant
than concretely represented targets. One explanation why
abstract thinking leads to more risk affinity compared with
concrete thinking stems from a further CLT prediction:
Abstract thinking promotes sensitivity to desirability consid-
erations (i.e., value of an end-state of an action: for instance,
amount of money gained within a risky task), and concrete
thinking promotes sensitivity to feasibility considerations
(i.e., ease of achieving the end-state; Lermer et al., 2014;
Raue, Streicher, Lermer, & Frey, 2015; Sagristano, Trope, &
Liberman, 2002).
However, the research presented by Lermer et al. (2014)
has two short comings, which we aim to address: First, the
previous research had no control groups. The addition of a
control group, with no mind-set manipulation, enables a
direct comparison between the risk-taking behavior of par-
ticipants who are abstract or concrete primed with those
whose mind-sets are not externally influenced. To do this,
the following hypotheses were formulated:
Hypothesis 1: Abstract thinking will result in more risk-
taking behavior than concrete thinking.

The Effect of Abstract and Concrete
Thinking on Risk-Taking Behavior in
Women and Men

Abstract
Recent studies have demonstrated that participants with an abstract mind-set (high construal level [CL]) showed an increased
risk affinity when compared with those with a concrete way of thinking (low CL). With regard to the importance of
replicating research findings, we conducted a replication study and re-investigated the CL effect on risk-taking. Furthermore,
we extended previous research by comparing experimental groups with a control group as well as by exploring effects of
sex. The CL effect on risk-taking was as expected. However, risk-taking by the control group did not differ from that by
the experimental groups. Both women and men took less risk after receiving concrete priming rather than abstract priming.
However, men were generally more risk-seeking compared with women. Both effects (men being more risk-seeking than
women and the CL effect) were successfully replicated.

Hypothesis 2: Risk-taking behavior of participants without
mind-set manipulation differs significantly from the behav-
ior of participants who receive mind-set manipulation.
Second, there was a surplus of women to men in the stud-
ies by Lermer et al. (2014). This raises the question whether
CL effect could be sex-independent and, as such, potentially
introduce a bias to the results. Previous research has shown
that men take more risks than women (for an overview, see
Byrnes, Miller, & Schafer, 1999). However, in the absence of
other published studies that show differences in CL effects
between the sexes, we propose that the differences in risk-
taking between the sexes is constant across different mind-
sets. To explore this notion, the following hypotheses were
formulated:
Hypothesis 3: Male participants show more risk-taking
behavior than female participants irrespective of the
mind-set.
Hypothesis 4: There is no relationship between CL and
sex in risk-taking behavior.
To investigate our hypotheses, we experimentally tested
the impact of CL on risk-taking behavior via CL priming and
a risk-taking task used by Lermer et al. (2014).
The present study is a replication of the CL effect and
extends previous research by addressing two short comings:
adding a control group and a gender-balanced sample.
Study
Method
Students (93 women, 90 men, M
age
= 23.76, SD
age
= 6.23)
were recruited on university campus to take part in the study
in exchange for course credit. Participants were assigned to a
3 (CL condition: concrete vs. control vs. abstract; randomly
assigned) × 2 (sex: female vs. male; equally assigned) design.
The experimental groups received either abstract or concrete
mind-set/CL priming whereas the control group received no
priming. A why-versus-how task (identically to the priming
used by Lermer et al., 2014, in their Studies 3-5; adapted
from Freitas, Gollwitzer, & Trope, 2004; Wakslak & Trope,
2009; for an overview, see Burgoon, Henderson, & Markman,
2013) was used as CL manipulation. In the abstract condi-
tion, participants answered six why-questions (e.g., "Why do
people take part in competitions?") by considering the under-
lying reasons for, and purposes of, an action. In the concrete
condition, participants answered six how-questions (e.g.,
"How to prepare for an exam?") by considering the way an
action is carried out.
Participants' risk-taking behavior was measured using the
Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; adapted from Lejuez
et al., 2002). Previous studies have shown that the BART is a
reliable measurement of risk-taking propensity (Lejuez,
Aklin, Zvolensky, & Pedulla, 2003). In this task, participants
receive 30 computer-simulated balloons, which they can
inflate by clicking a "pump" button (with each click the bal-
loon inflates and the participants receive a virtual 5¢). The
money accumulates until either the participant decides to fin-
ish the round and save the accumulated money by pressing
the collect button, or until the balloon bursts (due to too
many pumps), which leads to a total loss of the accumulated
money for that balloon. The aim of the BART is to collect as
much money as possible.
Participants were not informed as to how many pumps
would burst a balloon. The number of pumps required to
burst the balloons was random but constant across
participants.
Results
Two risk-taking indicators of the BART-data were calculated
following the recommendation of Lejuez et al. (2002): mean
number of pumps per balloon that did not burst (mean clicks)
and total number of burst balloons (bursts). In addition, and
in line with Lermer et al. (2014), a risk index of the z-stan-
dardized means of both measures was calculated (cf. Hiemer
& Abele, 2012) as these indicators were sufficiently highly
correlated, r = .656, p < .001.
Results of 3 (CL condition: concrete vs. control vs.
abstract) × 2 (sex: female vs. male)ANOVAs revealed no sig-
nificant main effect for CL on mean clicks, F(2, 182) = 2.189
p = .115, 2 = .024, but marginally significant main effects on
bursts, F(2, 182) = 2.79, p = .064, 2 = .031, and risk index,
F(2, 182) = 3.03, p = .051, 2 = .033. Mean values indicate
that concrete thinkers have a lower, and abstract thinkers a
higher, risk propensity (Table 1). Post hoc tests (Fisher's least
significant difference; LSD) revealed that abstract and con-
crete thinkers differed significantly in their risk-taking behav-
ior across all indicators (mean clicks, p = .038; bursts, p =
.019; risk index, p = .015). Thus, the findings of Lermer et al.
(2014) were replicated and Hypothesis 1 confirmed.
There were no significant differences in risk-taking
between the control group and the experimental groups,
although, descriptively, the differences in risky behavior
were as expected.1 Therefore, based on the results to this
study, we cannot conclude that the experimental group of
abstract/concrete thinkers took more or less risks than the
control group of nonprimed participants. Thus, Hypothesis 2
could not be confirmed.
In the ANOVA tests, the influence of the participant's sex
on risk-taking behavior showed significant main effects in
that men took more risk in the BART than women on mean
clicks, F(1, 182) = 9.94, p = .002, 2 = .053; bursts, F(1, 182)
= 5.17, p = .024, 2 = .028; as well as for the risk index, F(1,
182) = 9.00, p = .003, 2 = .048. However, this influence was
smaller in the experimental groups than in the control group
across the three different CL conditions. In the control condi-
tion, males took significantly more risks than females on
Lermer et al. 3
mean clicks, F(1, 64) = 4.88, p = .031, 2 = .072, as well as on
the risk index, F(1, 64) = 4.99, p = .029, 2 = .072, and the
results were marginally significant on bursts, F(1, 64) = 3.56,
p = .064, 2 = .054. However, although the mean values for
participants in the concrete condition indicated that male par-
ticipants took more risks than female participants, the main
effect of sex was not significant for mean clicks, F(1, 59) =
2.27, p = .137, 2 = .038; bursts, F(1, 59) = 1.18, p = .282, 2
= .020; or risk index, F(1, 59) = 1.93, p = .169, 2 = .032.
A similar relationship was found in the abstract condition;
means indicated that men took more risks than women, but
ANOVAs' results showed only a marginally significant main
effect on mean clicks, F(1, 57) = 3.09, p = .084, 2 = .052, and
no significant main effect on bursts, F(1, 57) = 1.08, p = .302,
2 = .019, and risk index, F(1, 57) = 2.62, p = .111, 2 = .045.
Thus, Hypothesis 3, that is, male participants show more risk-
taking behavior than female participants irrespective of the
mind-set, could not be confirmed for an abstract mind-set.
Means indicated that male participants showed higher risk pro-
pensity across all conditions. However, the difference between
sexes was strongest in the control condition, as effect sizes
showed, but not significant in both experimental conditions.
There were no interaction effects of sex and CL across all
indicators, ps > .859. Thus, abstract mind-set manipulation
seemed to increase, and concrete mind-set manipulation
seemed to decrease risk-taking behavior in both women and
men. Furthermore, results indicate that both abstract and
concrete thinking reduces the sex difference in risk-taking
behavior in comparison with the control condition. These
results confirm Hypothesis 4, in that there is no relationship
between CL and sex on risk-taking behavior (see Table 1).
Discussion
The present research is a successful replication study of the
CL effect. Although replications are of enormous importance,
they are not very popular with researchers. One reason might
be that replications often are perceived as not very interesting
and less informative than new findings, especially when the
investigated effect is not a prominent one. This leads to the
question of what is high in replication value and who decides
on that? Given the under-representation of replication studies,
literature proves that despite the so-called "replication crisis"
in psychology, these studies have difficulties to find their way
to relevant scientific journals.
Results of the present study showed that adapting con-
crete thinking leads to lower risk-taking than abstract think-
ing (cf. Lermer et al., 2014). Furthermore, the present
research extends previous findings: First, it cannot be con-
cluded that abstract or concrete thinking either increases or
decreases risk-taking behavior per se. The degree of risk-
taking behavior was descriptively as expected for the experi-
mental groups' risk propensity (lower risk-taking by abstract
thinkers and higher risk-taking by concrete thinkers), but the
differences between the control condition and the experi-
mental conditions were not significant. In other words, the
CL effect was only found in the comparison of abstract and
concrete thinkers, and not to the comparison of participants
who did not receive a mind-set manipulation (i.e., control),
with those who received an abstract or concrete mind-set
manipulation.
Second, results support the empirically well-replicated
findings that men take more risks than women. However, the
present research also shows that this difference between the
sexes is reduced when participants adopt an abstract or con-
crete mind-set. Differences in risk-taking between the sexes
were not significant when participants received an abstract or
concrete mind-set manipulation (however, the descriptive dif-
ference remained in the expected direction). Effect sizes
revealed that differences in the behavior of the sexes were
strongest for participants with no mind-set manipulation. One
explanation for the reduced effect in the experimental

conditions might be due to floor and/or ceiling effects, in that,
we assume that the CL impact on risk-taking in the BART is
limited to certain degrees of risk aversion and risk affinity.
In conclusion, our results empirically support the CL
effect on risk behavior as reported by Lermer and colleagues
(2014): Abstract, rather than concrete, thinking increases
risk-taking behavior. Moreover, the general influence of CL
priming on risk behavior seems to be similar in men and
women. However, results indicate that typical differences in
risk behavior between the sexes are reduced when partici-
pants have adopted an abstract or concrete mind-set.
