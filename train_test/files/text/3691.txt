Abstract
Objective: Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been widely used as a sedative, acting as an
a2-adrenergic agonist on autoreceptors, presynaptic receptors and postsynaptic receptors
without risk of respiratory depression. Although consciousness impairment is closely related to
disturbances of brain function in different frequency bands, the time-varying DEX effects on
cortical activity in specific frequency bands has not yet been studied.
Methods: We used electroencephalography (EEG) to analyse differences in cerebral
cortex activity between the awake and sedated states, using electromagnetic tomography
(standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA)) to localize multiple
channel scalp recordings of cerebral electric activity to specific brain regions.
Results: The results revealed increased activity in the cuneus at delta-band frequencies,
and in the posterior cingulate cortex at theta frequencies, during awake and sedated
states induced by DEX at specific frequency bands. Differences in standardized low resolution
cingulate gyrus were found in beta1 frequencies (13­18 Hz), and in the cuneus at gamma
frequencies.
Conclusion: Cerebral cortical activity was significantly altered in various brain areas during
DEX sedation, including parts of the default mode network and common midline core in
different frequency ranges. These alterations may elucidate the mechanisms underlying
DEX sedation.

Introduction
Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is widely used
as a sedative.1 DEX has little effect on
respiratory function, making it useful in
situations for procedures performed within
the airway, such as dental procedures.
Unlike other sedatives, which act on
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) recep-
tors, DEX acts as an a2-adrenergic agonist
on autoreceptors, presynaptic receptors and
postsynaptic receptors. DEX acts on a2
receptors in neurons that emanate from the
locus coeruleus (LC),2­3 producing a seda-
tive effect resembling the electroencephalog-
raphy (EEG) pattern of non rapid eye
movement (NREM) sleep II.4 The different
site of action of DEX compared with other
sedatives suggests that DEX may have a
different anaesthetic mechanism. However,
although DEX has been widely used to
sedate patients, few studies have been per-
formed to elucidate the mechanisms of
DEX-induced sedation by examining
changes in cortical activation.
Sedation can be considered as the state
between consciousness and the loss of con-
sciousness. According to information inte-
gration theory, consciousness requires the
integration of scattered information pro-
cessed in different brain areas.5,6 As such,
anaesthetic-induced impaired consciousness
is likely to induce changes in cortical activity.
Previous studies have shown that different
levels of altered consciousness are associated
with modulation of activity in multiple brain
regions.7,8 Understanding potential cortical
differences during sedation may be useful
for understanding the neural correlates of
impaired consciousness. Functional neuroi-
maging studies have shown that DEX
primarily disturbs long-range thalamocorti-
cal interactions.4 However, time-varying
DEX effects on cortical activity cannot be
evaluated using neuroimaging methods that
provide the highest spatial resolution, such as
functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). In addition, the brain modulates its
functioning in specific frequency bands,9 and
consciousness impairment is closely related
to disturbances in brain function in different
frequency bands.5 Even though interactions
between distant brain areas are modulated in
specific frequency bands, the cortical effects
of DEX on comprehensive brain networks in
various frequency bands has not yet been
investigated.
In the current study, we analysed differ-
ences in cerebral cortex activity between
awake and sedated states induced by DEX,
using standardized low resolution electromag-
netic tomography (sLORETA). sLORETA
localizes cerebral electric activity obtained
through EEG recordings from multiple chan-
nels to specific brain regions, as a functional
brain imaging method.10,11 sLORETA has
been used to investigate the neurophysio-
logical correlates of various diseases.
However, few attempts have been made to
investigate the neural correlates of sedation
using this technique.
Thus, in the current study, we aimed to
investigate changes in cortical activity
during DEX sedation, to examine the poten-
tial neural correlates of DEX-induced con-
sciousness impairment.
Materials and methods
Participant recruitment
A sample of 20 healthy participants ranging
in age from 20­40 years were enrolled in this
Kim et al. 1159
study. All participants provided written
informed consent, and approval was given
by the Institutional Review Board of the
College of Dentistry at Seoul National
University. Each participant was instructed
to fast for at least 8 hours prior to the
experiment. Participants with significant
medical diseases or laboratory abnormal-
ities were excluded from the study.
EEG recording and dexmedetomidine
infusion
Participants were acclimated to a room
shielded against sound and electric fields,
where EEG was recorded. Thirty-two elec-
trodes were attached in the standard 10-20
international placement after fitting an
appropriate EEG cap that best matched
the head circumference of the participant.
EEG recording was referenced to an average
EEG, while keeping the impedance of all
electrodes below 5 k
. Data were stored on
a PC at a sampling rate of 2048 Hz during
the entire experiment. After obtaining EEG
recordings for 5 min with eyes closed,
DEX was administered with a 0.5 mcg/kg
loading bolus over 10 min, followed by a
0.5 mcg/kg/hr infusion until unconscious-
ness was reached. During the DEX infusion,
cuff blood pressure, electrocardiogram,
pulse-oximetry, and capnography were
monitored. The bispectral index (BIS) was
also monitored for objective evaluation of
sedation depth. We instructed participants
to keep their eyes closed during the entire
experiment, and defined loss of consciousness
as the loss of response to a verbal request
to grasp the hand every 30 seconds. We
stopped DEX administration when partici-
pants reached unconsciousness. Recovery of
consciousness after discontinuing DEX infu-
sion was evaluated as a positive response to
verbal requests to grasp the hand, or spon-
taneous eye opening. EEG was continuously
recorded until the participant regained full
consciousness evaluated by either the return
to baseline BIS value or a positive response
to the question ``Are you feeling the same
as before, when you were sitting in the
dental chair?''
EEG preprocessing
Three 1-minute epochs of EEG data were
selected for analysis from all participants in
two conditions, awake and sedated. During
DEX injection, we selected the 3 minutes of
EEG recording 30 seconds before the loss of
consciousness. All episodic artefacts were
carefully removed from the EEG signal by
manual inspection. The data were prepro-
cessed by down-sampling to 256 Hz with
a 0.5 Hz high-pass filter, a 70 Hz low-pass
filter (fast Fourier transform filter applying
a Hanning window) and a 60 Hz notch
filter (64th-order finite impulse response
[FIR] notch filters). EEG data pairs were
baseline corrected to the average reference.
In addition, independent component ana-
lysis (ICA) was performed to minimize
artefacts from micro muscle movement,
blinking, electrical noise and pulses from
the carotid artery.
Source localization analysis
Standardized low-resolution brain electro-
magnetic tomography (sLORETA),10 a
functional imaging method using certain
electrophysiological and neuroanatomical
constraints, was conducted to estimate
sources in the brain from electrical activity
at the scalp in each of the following
six frequency bands: delta (1.5­4 Hz), theta
(4­8 Hz), alpha (8­12 Hz), beta1 (sigma)
(13­18 Hz), beta2 (18.5­21 Hz), beta3
(21.5­30 Hz), and gamma (30­44 Hz).12
sLORETA gives a single linear solution to
the inverse problem of functional cortical
localization based on extracranial measure-
ments12 and generates images of standardized
current density with no localization bias.10
The localization accuracy of sLORETA has
1160 Journal of International Medical Research 45(3)
been repeatedly validated by combining it
with other localization methods, such as
structural magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI),13 fMRI14,15 and positron emission
tomography.16,17
Statistical analyses
To identify potential differences between the
awake and sedated states induced by DEX
infusion, voxel-by-voxel analysis using
sLORETA was performed for the six fre-
quency bands, with between-condition com-
parisons of the current density distribution.
Statistical nonparametric mapping (SPM) of
sLORETA images was performed for each
contrast using sLORETA's built-in voxel-
wise randomization tests (5000 permuta-
tions) and employing a log-F ratio statistic
for independent groups with a threshold
P < 0.05.
Results
Among 20 subjects, EEGs obtained from
two subjects were contaminated with exces-
sive artefacts, which could not be removed
even by applying sophisticated preprocess-
ing techniques. Therefore, data from these
participants were excluded from subsequent
analyses.
The mean dose of DEX was 33.6 mcg.
The mean baseline BIS was 93.2 during
awake state and 77.3 during DEX induced
sedation, respectively.
DEX-induced sedation was associated
with cortical activity changes in different
frequency bands. Compared with the base-
line state, increased activity was found in the
cuneus (BA 18) in the delta frequency band,
the posterior cingulate cortex (BA 23) in the
theta frequency, the cingulate gyrus (BA 24)
in the sigma frequency band, and the cuneus
(BA 18) in the gamma frequency bands, and
was most prominent during DEX-induced
sedation (Figures 1 (a), (b), (d), (e)).
In contrast, relative to the awake state,
decreased activity was observed in the
fusiform gyrus (BA 20) in the alpha fre-
quency bands, and was most promin-
ent during DEX-induced sedation, which
was lateralized to the left. (Figure 1-c).
Meanwhile, no significant differences were
observed in the beta2 and beta3 frequency
bands during DEX induced sedation. The
cortical areas demonstrating significant
changes during DEX-induced sedation for
each frequency band are described in detail
in Table 1.
Discussion
We found that DEX induced cortical activ-
ity changes during an impaired conscious-
ness state. To the best our knowledge, this is
the first study to investigate sedation-related
cortical activity changes in each brain fre-
quency band, with which the brain regulates
its functioning.9
We utilized an inverse modelling tech-
nique to determine which areas in specific
frequency ranges were disturbed in the brain
during DEX sedation. This inverse model-
ling method (sLORETA) is based on the
notion that individual neurons are synchro-
nized with adjacent neurons, and this
enables electrical source localization.11,18
Through localizing the sources of electric
activity, sLORETA statistically computes
the difference in cerebral electrical activity
between two states, and visualizes statistical
results in a three dimensional distribution.
This three dimensional distribution of stat-
istical differences is displayed as a current
density distribution in the solution space,
allowing for the detection of changes in
brain activity more easily.11,18 However, few
studies have attempted to investigate the
mechanisms underlying impaired conscious-
ness using sLORETA, despite its advan-
tages, such as its simplicity and graphical
representation of brain activity differences
between two conditions. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to investigate the
Kim et al. 1161
mechanisms underlying DEX sedation using
the sLORETA technique.
The default mode network (DMN) has
been investigated as an anatomical and
functional mechanism for maintaining
attention and consciousness.19 In addition,
the common midline core (CMC), which
includes the midline precuneus/cuneus, pre-
frontal cortex, and other brain areas, is
commonly targeted by general anaesthetic,

resulting in anesthesia.20 The DMN is
reported to be activated in situations where
attention to external environments is not
necessary. The DMN consists of multiple
interacting subsystems within the brain.
Although the precise function of the DMN
remains unclear, it is thought to play a
critical role in internally-directed cognition.
The DMN is activated during non-stressful
resting states, such as autobiographical
memory and planning for the future.
DMN disturbance is also associated with
the development of neuropsychiatric dis-
eases, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizo-
phrenia, autism, depression and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder.21 In the
DMN, the posterior cingulate cortex
(PCC) acts as a hub, and is functionally
connected to other brain areas.22 The cur-
rent results revealed that cortical activity

changes associated with DEX sedation
involved significant alterations in PCC,
which acts as a hub within the DMN.
DEX also caused changes in brain activity
in other areas of the DMN (precuneus,
angular gyrus), although these changes did
not reach statistical significance (data not
shown). Considering the roles of the DMN
and CMC in regulating consciousness and
mental states, DEX may be likely to induce
changes in both DMN and CMC activity,
leading to impaired consciousness.
In accord with this hypothesis, DEX-
induced sedation was associated with sig-
nificant changes in cortical activity in the
PCC, an area that acts as a hub among
DMN and CMC structures. However, cor-
tical activity in this area was augmented
rather than suppressed, contrary to our
expectation. These results appear to contra-
dict those of previous studies demonstrating
impaired activity in these brain areas during
general anesthesia.20,23 It remains unclear
why DEX sedation was associated with
increased cortical activation in these areas.
However, a recent study may provide an
explanation for increased brain-specific
activity appearing somewhat contradictory
in a DEX-induced sedative state, as dis-
cussed below.
In line with the current results, a previous
study reported that functional connectivity
of the PCC to other brain area increases
during propofol sedation.24 In the awake
state, the arousal center in the brainstem
inhibits PCC function.24 During sedation, as
the connection from the arousal center to
the PCC weakens, the PCC paradoxically
increases functional connectivity to other
brain areas. The PCC acts as a hub within
the DMN brain network22 and connects to
other brain areas, such as the cuneus and
anterior cingulate cortex, in which increased
activation during sedation was observed
in the current study. Taken together,
these findings suggest that the increased
activity we observed in these regions may
have resulted from disinhibition during sed-
ation, making robust connections more
prominent. From the perspective of infor-
mation integration, the synchronized brain
network may impair the efficiency of infor-
mation processing.25 In clinical practice,
impaired responses to external stimuli,
such as verbal, auditory, and visual stimuli
are commonly observed under sedation.
Increased activation during sedation may
be related to impaired and delayed responses
to stimuli during sedation.
In the alpha frequency bands, we
observed decreased cortical activity in the
auditory cortex (AC) and the fusiform
gyrus, where significant cortical activity
alterations were observed during sedation.
The fusiform gyrus is involved in processing
word recognition and visual information,26
while AC activation is associated with audi-
tory stimulation. The PCC plays an import-
ant role in auditory perception.27 Perceived
auditory stimulation is a prerequisite for
word recognition,28 and one study reported
that event-related potentials during auditory
stimulation are significantly affected in the
alpha frequency range.29 The present study
demonstrated deactivation in temporal
brain areas in the alpha frequency bands
which may explain the delayed response to
verbal stimuli. In the current study, all sub-
jects showed a delayed response to verbal
stimuli that were presented to evaluate the
level of consciousness before unconscious-
ness was exhibited. Considering the import-
ance of the fusiform gyrus in regulating visual
perception, DEX may also impair the effi-
ciency of visual stimulus processing, leading
to blurred or double vision30 during sedation,
even though the subjects in the present
experiment were instructed to close their eyes.
Interestingly, the deactivation in the
alpha frequency band was lateralized to the
left. Alpha oscillation is involved in higher
cognitive processes, such as memory and
consciousness.31 A left-lateralized neural
system distributed in the frontal, parietal,
1164 Journal of International Medical Research 45(3)
and temporal lobes is thought to be involved
in language and memory processing.32­34
Therefore, the DEX induced left-lateralized
deactivation we observed in the alpha fre-
quency band may suggest that the neural
network required for high-level verbal and
memory processing can be separated during
deep DEX sedation.
Although the current study revealed sev-
eral neural correlates that may be associated
with DEX-induced sedation, there are sev-
eral limitations that should be addressed in
future studies. First, we focused on changes
in cortical activity during DEX sedation.
However, a change in brain activity does not
guarantee alterations in brain network prop-
erties. Even without changes in brain activ-
ity, functional connectivity between different
brain areas may be altered.24 It is therefore
necessary to identify changes in the EEG
dynamics associated with sedation induced
by DEX. Further studies should be con-
ducted to clarify this point in more depth.
Second, changes in cortical activity, as
shown in this study, may represent different
patterns during different levels of sedation.
Previous studies have shown that DEX
induces changes in sleep-like EEG patterns
and causes a slight increase in power in the
theta, alpha and beta bands.35­37 Indeed, we
have shown that DEX changes the activity
of the cerebral cortex in these frequency
bands. However, the activation pattern of
the cerebral cortex may vary with each
frequency band depending on the depth.
Investigating cortical activity during DEX
infusion at a constant level of effect-site
concentration may be helpful for elucidating
the mechanisms underlying different levels
of impaired consciousness. Furthermore,
EEG changes between different levels of
sedation should also be compared with
better understand transitional changes
from consciousness to unconsciousness.
In summary, the current results revealed
changes in cortical activity in different fre-
quency ranges during DEX sedation. These
alterations may explain the mechanisms
underlying DEX sedation, potentially
enabling the tracking of changes in levels
of consciousness as an objective marker
during DEX administration.
