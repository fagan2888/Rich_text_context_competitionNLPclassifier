Introduction
AngII is a key hormone involved in both cardiovascular
homeostasis and development of multiple cardiac diseases.1
In the heart, sustained AngII signalling promotes myocar-
dial hypertrophy and fibrosis through induction of several
immediate early genes (c-fos, c-mys and c-jun), late genes
including -smooth muscle actin (SMA), collagens and
natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP), and the growth fac-
tors angiotensinogen and transforming growth factor 
(TGF-).2,3 Eventually the hypertrophic and fibrotic
response leads to heart failure. Hence, the AngII type 1
receptor (AT1
R) is a prominent drug target in cardiovascu-
lar medicine. The classical description of AT1
R signalling
depicts Gq-protein activation and downstream signalling
through the canonical MAP kinases Erk1/2 that translocate
to the nucleus and initiate gene transcription.4­6 We previ-
ously demonstrated that AT1
R signalling also regulates five
microRNAs (miRNAs), including the miR-132/212 family,
in primary cultures of cardiac fibroblasts.4
MiRNAs are endogenous short non-coding RNAs that
interact with specific target mRNAs based on sequence

Abstract
Introduction: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of cardiovascular development and disease;
however, the cardiac miRNA target molecules are not well understood. We and others have described the Angiotensin
II (AngII)-induced miR-132/212 family as novel regulators of cardiovascular function including regulation of cardiac
hypertrophy, heart failure and blood pressure possibly through AT1
R signalling. However, the miR-132/212 targets in
the heart remain unknown.
Materials and methods: To understand the role of these miRNAs in cardiac signalling networks, we undertook
comprehensive in silico and in vitro experiments to identify miR-132/212 molecular targets in primary rat cardiac
fibroblasts.
Results: MiR-132/212 overexpression increased fibroblast cell size and mRNA arrays detected several hundred genes
that were differentially expressed, including a wide panel of receptors, signalling molecules and transcription factors.
Subsequent comprehensive in silico analysis identified 24 target genes, of which 22 genes were qPCR validated. We
identified seven genes involved in AngII signalling pathways.
Conclusion: We here report novel insight of an extensive network of molecular pathways that fine-tuned by miR-
132/212, suggesting a role for this miRNA family as master signalling switches in cardiac fibroblasts. Our data underscore
the potential for miRNA tools to manipulate a large array of molecules and thereby control biological function.

complementarities in the 3´UTR of the target mRNA,
resulting in translational repression and/or mRNA degra-
dation.7,8 miR-132 and miR-212 are highly conserved
miRNAs, closely clustered in the genome9 and are tran-
scribed together under the regulation of cAMP response
element binding protein (CREB),10 known to be an AngII-
regulated gene. In most tissues, miR-132 is expressed at
much higher levels than miR-212, which suggests that
miR-132 may be the predominant regulator of the two.11
MiRNA family members often have identical target speci-
ficity because they share common `seed regions', the 2­8
bases positioned at the 5´end of the miRNA representing
the primary contributors to mRNAs target recognition.
However, the interactions of the 3´end of the miRNAs are
also important determinants of target specificity within
miRNA families.7 Therefore miR-132 and miR-212 that
belong to the same family may be functionally redundant
in regulation of some target genes but not of others.11
Several pieces of data suggest that AngII dictates miR-
132 and miR-212 expression. We previously demonstrated
that AngII increases miR-132 and miR-212 expression
through an AT1
R-Gq-ERK1/2-dependent pathway4 in a
cell line overexpressing AT1
R and in primary cultures of
cardiac fibroblasts. In line with these findings, we subse-
quently found that miR-132 and miR-212 increased in
response to AngII in hypertensive rats while these miR-
NAs decrease in human patients treated with AngII recep-
tor blockers.12 Others have shown that the miR-132/212
family promotes cardiac hypertrophy and autophagy in
cardiomyocytes,13 and that miR-132/212 null mice are
protected from pressure overload-induced heart failure.13
However, several questions regarding the mechanisms and
downstream regulation of miR-132 and miR-212 targets
involved in AngII signalling still remain unanswered. We
therefore undertook a detailed analysis of miR-132/212
targets to understand the role of miR-132 and miR-212 in
AngII signalling networks in cardiac fibroblasts.
Materials and methods
Cardiac fibroblast cell culture
Adult rat-derived fibroblasts were isolated by the principle
of selective plating as previously described,14­16 with some
modification. In brief, 8­10-week-old male Sprague-
Dawley rats (Taconic, Denmark) were sacrificed and
hearts were rinsed in a preparation buffer (1.2 mM
KH2
PO4
, 0.25 g/l Na2
CO3
, 6.44 g/l NaCL, 2.6 mM KCl,
1.2 mM Mg2
SO4
, 11 mM glucose supplemented with 50
IE/ml Heparin). Arterial tissue and visible vasculature
were removed and ventricles were trypsinised twice for 10
min in 10 ml 0.08% Trypsin (BD, New Jersey, USA) sup-
plemented with DNase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA).
Tissue fragments were washed, minced and incubated with
9500 U Collagenase Type 2 (Worthington Biochemical
Corp., USA) in HBSS (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA)
and supplemented with DNase, for 70 min disrupted by
swirling. The suspension was dissociated by thorough
pipetting in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 50 U.ml-1 penicillin and 50 U.ml-1 strep-
tomycin (PS) (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA) before
being passed across a 100 µm filter (DB, New Jersey,
USA). Cells were incubated for 6 min on ice with 0.9%
NH4
Cl, 0.08% NaHCO3
, 20 µM Tetrasodium EDTA for
lysis of erythrocytes and washed before the suspension
was pre-plated for 1 h in cell culture dishes in
DMEM/10%FBS/1%PS. After 1 h, the cultures were
washed thoroughly with PBS and the remaining adherent
cells were cultivated for 3 days to sub-confluence (~80%)
and used directly as specified in the text. Cells were
deprived of serum for 1 h prior to stimulation with 100 nM
AngII (Sigma-Aldricht, St. Louis, USA).
Cell number and volume
After 44 h, cultured cells were gently detached by 0.25%
Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, USA).
Cells were resuspended and diluted in isotonic fluid and
counted in the range of 8­24 µm. The cell number and cell
diameter were measured using a Beckman Coulter
Multisizer Z2 (RAMCON A/S, Denmark) and counting
was performed in three independent experiments, each
comprising triplicate measurements.
MTT assay
After 44 h cell viability was validated by the mitochondrial
activity through the reduction of MTT (3-(4,5.
Dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromid) by
the cells, using standard Vybrant MTT proliferation assay
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies, USA). In brief, cells were
incubated at 37°C/5% CO2
with 0.5mg/ml MTT in phenol
red-free cultivation medium for 4 h. Formazan crystals
were solubilised in 10% SDS/0.01 M HCl at 80 rpm and
absorbance was measured at 570­690 nm.
Immunohistochemistry
Cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) in PBS (Bie and Berntsen LAB, Denmark), permea-
bilised for 10 min in 0.1% TX100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, USA) and blocked for 15 min with 2% BSA
(Calbiochem, USA) in TBS. Cells were incubated over-
night in 1% BSA/TBS with mouse anti--smooth muscle
actin (SMA; Sigma-Aldrich; clone 1A4, 11 µg/ml), visu-
alised by incubation for 1 h with Alexa 555-conjugated
secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, USA:
1:200). As isotype, control mouse anti-IgG2a (Sigma-
Aldrich; UPC-10) were applied. Slides were mounted with
mounting medium (Vectorshield, Vector Lab, UK)
1290 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
containing DAPI for staining of nuclei, and images were
acquired using a Leica DMI4000B Cool Fluo Package
instrument equipped with a Leica DFC340 FX Digital
Camera. In all experiments, exposure (camera settings)
and picture processing (brief adjustment of contrast/bright-
ness and colour balance by Photoshop CS5) were applied
equally to all images
Transfection
Cardiac fibroblasts were equilibrated in serum-free
medium 1 h and thereafter transfected for 4 h with 30 nM
mature synthetic pre-miRNA (15 nM of each miRNA
when used in combination), using Lipofectamine 2000
protocol (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, USA) as recom-
mended by the manufacturer, except that DMEM was
applied as transfection medium. Transfected cardiac fibro-
blasts were washed and further cultured for 24 h in serum-
free DMEM. Pre-miR-132 (PM10166), pre-miR-212
(PM12534) and pre-miR scramble controls (AM17110)
were purchased from Ambion, Life Technologies, USA.
mRNA and miRNA analysis
Relative qRT-PCR of mRNA and miRNA were performed
as previously described.16,17 Briefly, total RNA was
extracted using TriReagent protocol (Molecular Research
Center, Inc. Cincinnati, USA), and RNA purity, integrity
and quantity were examined by spectrophotometry
(Nanodrop® Technologies, Thermo Scientific, USA) and
Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100) measurements. SYBR green-
based relative quantitative mRNA PCR was performed on
reverse-transcribed cDNA (High Capacity cDNA RT kit;
Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, USA) using prim-
ers listed in Table S1. For TaqMan-based miRNA, qRT-
PCR primers specific for rat miR-132 (#000457), miR-212
(#002551), miR-17 (#002308), miR-191 (#002299) were
purchased from Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies,
USA. Amplification and detection were performed using
7900HTFastReal-TimePCRSystem(AppliedBiosystems,
Life Technologies, USA). As recommended by others18,19
and previously described,16,17 we used the qBase+ software
to normalise all qRT-PCR data against multiple stably
expressed control genes (Table S2).
mRNA microarray and data processing
Total RNA samples of 500 ng were reverse-transcribed
followed by in vitro transcription into biotin-labelled
cRNA using the MessageAmp II Enhancer kit (Applied
Biosystems, Life Technologies, USA) according to the
manufacturer's instruction for a single-round amplifica-
tion. Purified and fragmented biotin-labelled cRNA was
hybridised toAffymetrix® GeneChip (Rat Genome 230 2.0
Array) and subsequently stained, washed and scanned
using the GeneChip Fluidics station 450 and the GeneChip
Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Array
quality was evaluated using affyQCReport package from
Bioconductor including NUSE (Normalised Unscaled
Standard Error) and RLE (Relative Log Expression) plots.
Normalisation and background correction was performed
with R software using the vsn package by Bioconductor
resulting in data that were log2
transformed. The dataset
was subjected to Sylamer analysis to identify the represen-
tation of 3´UTR miRNA binding sites in genes expressed
under the influence of miR-132/212 overexpression.
Sylamer is a bioinformatic program that catalogues puta-
tive miRNA binding sites in the 3´UTR regions of genes
and determines if the pattern deviates from neutral expec-
tations in rank-ordered list of genes. Here, Sylamer is used
to find significant depletion of a word that is complemen-
tary to the seed sequence of miR132/212, i.e. GACTGTT.
Genes identified by Sylamer analysis (~600) were sub-
sequently analysed by Ingenuity pathway analysis (http://
www.ingenuity.com) for potential targets involved in the
renin­AngII signalling pathway.
Statistical analysis
All analyses comprised independent experiments, and
one-way ANOVA or paired t-tests were performed as
indicated (GraphPad Prism (5.0 version) software) to
test significant levels. A value of p  0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant. All error bars indicate mean
± s.d. The primary rat-derived cardiac fibroblasts were
not passaged and thus the number of experiments (n)
reflects the number of cell batches treated as independ-
ent experiments.
Results
AngII regulated miRNAs in vitro
We previously established an efficient protocol for isola-
tion of primary rat-derived cardiac fibroblasts,4 allowing
us to search for potential targets of the AngII-induced
miRNAs (i.e. miR-132 and miR-212) identified in our pre-
vious study.4,12 The cardiac fibroblasts were incubated
with 100 nM AngII resulting in deposition of SMA stress
components, increased cell size and cell viability (Figure
1(a) and (b)). Furthermore using qRT-PCR, we confirmed
that the expression of both miR-132 and miR-212 were
significantly upregulated by two-fold in fibroblasts stimu-
lated with AngII as compared with controls (Figure 1(c)).
MiR-132/212 overexpression increase cardiac
fibroblast size
To analyse whether miR-132/212 overexpression has an
impact on cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and to search for
potential miR-132/212 targets, we applied transfection of
synthetic pre-miR-132 and pre-miR-212 individually
Eskildsen et al. 1291
(Figure S1) or in combination (Figure 2(a)). MiR-132 was
increased by ~44.500 fold, whereas miR-212 was increased
by ~650 fold, compared with respective pre-miR-Controls.
Interestingly, we found that overexpressing a combination
of miR-132/212 led to a significant (p < 0.01) cell size
enlargement, indicating that miR-132/212 mimics the
effect of AngII on fibroblast cell volume (Figure 2(b))
compared with controls. No changes were observed for
cell number or mitochondrial activity after transfection of
the miRNAs (Figure 2(b)).
MiR-132 and miR-212 target a wide panel of
mRNA genes
To identify miR-132/212 molecular functions in AngII
signalling pathways, we overexpressed miR-132/212
followed by a genome-wide approach identifying
approximately 20,000 annotated genes, of which 2000
genes were differentially expressed (p < 0.05). Next,
potential miR-132/212 targets were detected using
Sylamer software and Ingenuity pathway analysis. This
process identified 24 candidate target genes for the
miR-132/212, of which we validated 22 genes. A flow
chart of the selection process is depicted in Figure 3(a).
Briefly, the software program, Sylamer, identified pres-
ence of the complementary sequence to the miR-
132/212 seed region in the 33% most regulated mRNAs
from the dataset (1665 downregulated and 4535 upregu-
lated, in total 6200) (Figure 3(b)). From this analysis,
600 downregulated genes enriched for the miR-132/212
binding site were selected and compared with predicted
miR-132/212 targets from three different miRNA target
prediction algorithms, i.e. TargetScan, miR-base and
PicTar. Interestingly, 30 genes were identified as targets

(DYRK2 and MAP3K3). RPL13a and GAPDH were used as reference genes (for reference genes, M and CV values see Table S2).

Ingenuity pathway analysis of the selected 600 genes
enriched for the miR-132/212 binding site identified seven
miR-132/212 targets in the renin­angiotensin­aldosterone
system (RAAS) (Figure 4). In general, the Ingenuity-
generated dataset depicts a pattern in which more genes in
the RAAS pathway are downregulated than upregulated
(20/13, respectively) and several genes are identified as
targets for miR-132 and miR-212 (orange circles).
Furthermore, CREB is included in Figure 4, as this
transcription factor is responsible for miR-132/212 tran-
scription and because CREB has previously been sug-
gested as a miR-132/212 target.20

were found to be downregulated by overexpression of
miR-132/212 (except GRB2 and PTEN). Out of 22 genes
downregulated genes, two genes (DYRK2 and MAP3K3)
were identified as significantly downregulated (p < 0.05)
while many were borderline significant (0.05 < p < 0.2),
confirming a strong tendency for these genes to be regu-
lated by miR-132/212 in the AngII signalling pathway

miR-132/212 targets in RAS; JAK2, RAS, GRB2, cJUN, PKC, AC and AGTR1. In addition, we included target genes selected from the
microarray and compared with prediction algoritms: RASA1, CALU, MAP3K3, SOD2, along with the transcription factor CREB, which
is known to transcribe miR-132 and miR-212. All potential targets were validated using qRT-PCR (Table 1).

(Table 1). Keeping in mind that miRNAs typically exert
modest inhibitory effects on many mRNAs, these results
strongly support the notion that miR-132 and miR-212
function as cellular conductors fine-tuning the AngII
actions in cardiac fibroblasts.
Discussion
Given the emerging roles of the miR-132/212 family in
cardiac hypertrophy and hypertension,12,13 it will be impor-
tant to characterise the molecular networks and targets by
which these miRNAs exert their functions. We previously
demonstrated that signalling through the AT1
R and Gq-
protein dependent pathway regulates five miRNAs, includ-
ing the miR-132/212 family in HEK293N cells stably
transfected with AT1R and in primary cultures of cardiac
fibroblasts, but not in cardiac myocytes.4 In this study, we
identified multiple miR-132/212 targets involved in AngII,
Endothelin-1 and canonical signalling pathways and sug-
gest that the miR-132/212 family functions to fine-tune the
AngII actions in cardiac fibroblasts.
Several signalling pathways activated by AngII contrib-
ute to cardiac fibroblast stress, expansion of cell volume and
contribute to hypertension in vivo. Interestingly, many of the
regulated targets we identified belong in these or similar
pathways. Of interest, we found target genes involved in
Ca2+ binding (ANXA4 and CALU),21,22 proliferation and
apoptosis (BTG2 and DYRK2),23,24 endothelial to mesenchy-
mal transition (MAP3K3 and ZFYVE16, also known as
SARA),25,26 involved in cell cycle (CDKN1A, MAP3K3,
NRAS, KRAS, PKC, VCAM, cJUN and RASA1)27 as well as
in AngII signalling leading to hypertrophy and fibrosis
(AGTR1, AC, PKC, EGR1, JAK2, cJUN and SOD2).28-31
All genes identified as targets, except PTEN and GRB2,
were attenuated in fibroblasts overexpressing miR-
132/212. The increase in GRB2 might be explained by the
missing miR-132/212 binding site and the fact that this
molecule is activated by AT2
R and subsequent Gi subunit
activation30,31 and not activated by the Gq subunit account-
ing for most of the hypertrophic and hypertensive effects
of AngII. The majority of targets were found to be attenu-
ated borderline significantly (0.05 < p <0.2; Table 1) and
two genes, DYRK2 and MAP3K3, were significantly
downregulated. These results support the notion that miR-
NAs typically exert modest inhibitory effects on many
mRNAs, which often encode proteins that govern the same
biological process or gene-regulatory networks.32
Interestingly, an evaluation of the biological effect of
overexpressing miR-132/212 revealed that the fibroblast
cell volume was significantly increased (p < 0.01), sug-
gesting that overexpression of the miRNAs mimic the
AngII-mediated effects. Of note, multiple factors such as
serum, starvation, density and plating conditions may
influence cell proliferation and cell size,4 thus the biologi-
cal relevance of the phenotypic changes observed in AngII
stimulated fibroblasts may be under the influence of other
factors.
Several studies identify miR-132/212 involvement in
the central nervous system, i.e. in neuronal function and
plasticity. From these studies, it is widely acknowledged
that miR-132/212 targets a wide panel of genes including
RASA1.9,10,33 MiR-132/212 has been shown to be involved
in neovascularisation, targeting the endothelial RASA1.34
In one study, miR-132 was reported to be constitutively
expressed and released by pericyte progenitor cells, and
transplantation of these cells into mice with myocardial
infarction showed an improvement in cardiac function
through proangiogenic and antifibrotic activities via inhi-
bition of its targets RASA1 and Methyl-CpG binding pro-
tein 2 (MeCP2).35 Moreover a recent study showed that
AngII induced expression of miR-132 targets PTEN and
RASA1 in vascular smooth muscle cells.20 These targets
were identified from prediction algorithms, and in vivo
verification of the results was inconclusive.
It should be mentioned that in addition to miR-132 and
miR-212, other miRNAs may also be involved in AngII-
mediated hypertension, and likewise at the levels of mRNA
targets our studies have most likely not identified all impli-
cated mediators of the effect from miR-132 and miR-212
inAngII signalling.Also, we cannot exclude that other fac-
tors such as Endothelin-1 and TGF-, which work syner-
gistically to AngII, may influence the data presented
herein. Another note of caution: transfection with pre-
miR-132/212 led to expression levels several magnitudes
higher than those elicited by AngII treatment, which may
obscure comparability of the cellular effects and increase
the risk of off-targets effects.
In addition to the described concept of miR-132/212
fine-tuning AngII actions in cardiac fibroblasts, it could be
speculated that AngII signalling could be affected by
miRNA redundancy. Thus, several miRNAs could coop-
eratively target various components of the signalling net-
work or be required to sufficiently repress a single target.
In addition, some miRNAs seem to `balance' specific
pathways by targeting both positive and negative regula-
tory components. We are just beginning to understand
these modes of action that uphold cellular homeostasis,
allowing buffering against minor physiological variations.
Genetic deletions of miRNAs in many different
organisms have shown that few developmental processes
are absolutely dependent on single miRNAs.36,37 Clearly,
miRNA biology represents a complex mode of gene
regulation.
In summary, miR-132/212 mimic and analysis of geno-
typic read-outs identified approximately 600 mRNAs,
including 22 validated targets involved in AngII signalling.
The targets were found to be attenuated and only a few sig-
nificantly by miR-132/212 overexpression, supporting the
notion of miR-132/212 conducting fine-tuning of AngII
actions in cardiac fibroblasts.
