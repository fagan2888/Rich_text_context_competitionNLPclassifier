Introduction
The aftermath of armed conflicts and wars is a complex and
intricate process characterized by reconstruction efforts and
reordering of social and political life at all levels.
Governments, multi- and bilateral agencies, and civil society
organizations play a vital role in conducting interventions as
part of medical and humanitarian initiatives. Their actions
are largely driven by the premise that not only combatants
but entire civilian populations exposed to the adversities of
armed conflict and war would require some form of humani-
tarian assistance, which may include the provision of medi-
cal and/or psychosocial services, such as psychotherapeutic
counseling, psychological aid, and emotional support (Allden
etal., 2009; Almedom & Summerfield, 2004; Bracken &
Petty, 1998; Moon, 2009; Pedersen, 2002; Pupavac, 2005;
Ritchie, Watson, & Friedman, 2006; Williams, 1998; Wood,
1996; Yehuda, 2002).
The origins of these practices can be traced back to the
frontline treatment (also called "forward psychiatry") pro-
vided to combatants by military psychiatrists during World
War I, which continued during World War II driven by the
principles of proximity (provision of services as close as pos-
sible to the frontlines), immediacy (treatment as soon as pos-
sible), and expectancy (rapid recovery and expected
resumption of normal duties at the frontlines; Friedman,
Ritchie, & Watson, 2006). Three decades later, in France,
"informal" psychotherapy sessions conducted among Latin
American torture victims of military regimes gave birth to
what Stanislas Tomkiewicz--a psychiatrist survivor of the
concentration camps--described under the name of "human-
itarian psychiatry" (Fassin & Rechtman, 2009).
Over the last few decades, the assistance to war victims
moved the focus from the battle field to the civilian domain,
leading to the establishment of different initiatives and vary-
ing responses ranging from "relief operations," entailing the

Searching for Best Practices:
A Systematic Inquiry Into the Nature
of Psychosocial Interventions Aimed at
Reducing the Mental Health Burden in
Conflict and Postconflict Settings
Duncan Pedersen1, Hanna Kienzler2, and Jaswant Guzder1
Abstract
Despite a growing body of literature, substantial variance remains between researchers, mental health experts, clinicians,
and practitioners over the nature, structure, and contents of psychosocial interventions aimed at reducing the mental health
burden in war-torn and postconflict societies. We conducted a focused and systematic review of the literature published
over the last two decades on the most commonly used psychotherapeutic treatment modalities in medical and humanitarian
interventions as represented by expert opinion, observational and qualitative or mixed-method studies, case reports, case
control, and community-based studies, excluding randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs. More
specifically, we aimed at searching for best practices and supporting psychosocial interventions within the domain of adult
mental health in civilian populations in low- and middle-income countries affected by protracted political violence, armed
conflict, and wars. We noted the need to translate existing knowledge into action (know-do gap) and the critical importance
of applying qualitative evidence-based knowledge that informs and supports collective interventions and best practices in
medical and humanitarian assistance programs currently being undertaken.

provision of the "five essentials" (protection/rescue, health,
food, water, and shelter) to more elaborate responses desig-
nated variously as "recovery," "rehabilitation," "post-con-
flict stabilization," and "peace-building" operations (Abiew
& Keating, 1999; Ballentine & Nitzschke, 2005; Goodhand,
Lewer, & Hulme, 1999; Lautze & Raven-Roberts, 2006;
White & Cliffe, 2000). Humanitarian assistance aimed at the
provision of medical and psychosocial services was gradu-
ally adopted, either independently or as part of larger social
reconstruction and development undertakings to support
peace, justice, social equity, reconciliation, and reversion of
the social breakdown experienced as a result of war and mass
violence (Brennan & Nandy, 2001; Fletcher & Weinstein,
2002; Ritchie etal., 2006; Smillie, 1998).
In the post­Cold War era, confronted by the emergence of
a different kind of armed conflicts and "new" wars (Kaldor,
2001), a variety of humanitarian experiments were con-
ducted by the so-called "new humanitarians" (Weiss, 2012).
According to T. G. Weiss (2012), these new wars had four
differential features with the conventional wars of the past:
first, the locus of war was no longer confined to a territory
with state borders; second, nonstate, nonmilitary actors
played an increasing important role (i.e., war lords); third,
the economies of war were no longer supported by govern-
ment funding, but by illicit activities (i.e., drug trafficking,
organized crime syndicates, etc.); and fourth, the death toll
was made up of increasing number of civilians as opposed to
military personnel.
In response to these wars, military interventions were
often conducted against governmental wishes or without
explicit or meaningful consent. These interventions were
carried on the grounds of humanitarian principles with the
purpose of preventing massive loss of life, genocide and
mass atrocities, and widespread abuses of human rights.
The term of "humanitarian interventions" was coined and
adopted in this particular sense, ranging across peace
enforcement, coercive protection of civilians, and war
fighting (Kienzler & Pedersen, 2012; Weiss, 2012; Wood,
1996). At the same time, the need for humanitarian assis-
tance grew exponentially and new actors--represented not
only by UN agencies but also by governmental agencies
and international nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs)--sprang up with each crisis. Funding for humani-
tarian assistance grew from about US$4.4 billion in 1999 to
an estimated US$15.1 billion in 2009 (Weiss, 2012). In
2013, the international community responded to the dra-
matic escalation of needs with a record US$22 billion in
funding. This was a significant increase from the 2 previous
years--and over US$2.5 billion more than the previous
peak of US$19.4 billion in 2010, the year of the Haiti earth-
quake and the Pakistani floods (Global Humanitarian
Assistance Report [GHA], 2014). The proliferation of
agencies, actors, and funds brought along the need for
establishing norms and treatment practices, as well as set-
ting minimum standards for emergency response.
Humanitarian assistance assumed a new identity no lon-
ger aimed to be palliative and politically neutral, but rather
actively contributing to address structural problems and
improve the quality of life including, whenever possible, to
consolidate the peace process (Calhoun, 2010). While the
provision of food and control of communicable diseases
were the main focus of humanitarian assistance programs
until the early 1990s, psychological trauma and the mental
health consequences of human rights abuses gradually
reemerged as a more salient feature and have since received
increasing attention as an area deserving effective collective
interventions (Barudy, 1989; Kienzler & Pedersen, 2012). As
a direct consequence of this shift in both aims and composi-
tion of humanitarian assistance, a wide range of interven-
tions addressing mental health and psychosocial needs
became the focus of attention of many Western-based
experts, social scientists, and health professionals (Bolton,
Tol, & Bass, 2009; Crumlish & O'Rourke, 2010; Good,
DelVecchio, Abramowitz, Kleinman, & Panter-Brick, 2014;
Hobfoll et
al., 2007; Inter-Agency Standing Committee
[IASC], 2007; Meffert & Ekblad, 2013; Shalev, 2002; Silove,
2004; Silove & Steel, 2006; Somasundaram, 2014; Tol,
Barbui, et
al., 2011; M. Weiss, Saraceno, Saxena, & van
Ommeren, 2003; World Health Organization [WHO], 2013).
That is, besides the provision of basic health care, humanitar-
ian initiatives increasingly included psychological or psychi-
atric aid and emotional support, and offered information,
sympathetic reassurance, and fostering of resilience and
social cohesion in recognition of core mental health and psy-
chosocial needs of the affected populations. Interestingly,
there remains substantial variance between researchers,
mental health experts, first responders, clinicians, and practi-
tioners over the nature, structure, and contents of psychoso-
cial interventions aimed at reducing the mental health burden
and suffering in war-torn and postconflict societies.
Moreover, it has been argued that despite the many treatment
options available, there is an overall lack of evidence for
most psychosocial interventions currently being imple-
mented (Allden etal., 2009; Tol, Barbui, etal., 2011).
To gain insight into this dynamic field broadly defined as
"psychosocial" and assess the qualitative evidence of the
most commonly used treatment modalities in collective
interventions aimed at civilian populations affected by armed
conflicts and wars, we conducted a focused and systematic
review of the literature. The review and related discussion
was driven by the following questions: (a) What are the
existing paradigms supporting psychosocial interventions in
medical and humanitarian initiatives aimed at reducing the
mental health burden of civilian populations in conflict and
postconflict settings? (b) What are the main implementation
gaps in the delivery of medical and psychosocial interven-
tions? On what kind of evidence are practices currently
based? (c) In light of the above, which are considered best
practices in individual and collective interventions aimed at
civilian populations exposed to armed conflict and war? The
Pedersen et al. 3
overall aim of the review and critical appraisal was to inform
readers and stakeholders of the assortment and range of psy-
chosocial and/or collective interventions aimed at civilian
populations, more specifically adults, exposed to armed con-
flict and wars in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
A Short Genealogy of Psychosocial
Interventions
As pointed above, the "psychosocial" construct in humani-
tarian aid endeavors emerged toward the end of the 1900s, as
an area of inquiry and practice combining both the psycho-
logical and social domains aimed at the modification of risk
factors and/or behaviors conducive to disease onset or recur-
rence resulting from exposure to extreme adversities, such as
war or natural disasters. Since then, these practices have
undergone multiple and successive changes and adaptations
in its recent history (Glass, 2000; Reyes, 2006). According to
Glass (2000), "psychosocial" has been conceptualized as
one's psychological development within, and in dynamic
interaction with, a given social environment and implies the
intimate connections existing between our social and our
psychological and biological existence. In conflict and post-
conflict settings, the attention of psychosocial advocates is,
therefore, focused on the stressful social and material condi-
tions such as poverty and destitution, food insecurity, social
conflicts within the community, and erosion of the social fab-
ric, including the marginalization and struggle of particular
groups such as former child soldiers, raped and sexually
abused survivors, refugees, widows and the elderly, and peo-
ple with disabilities (Miller & Rasmussen, 2010).
As these conditions are believed to cause and exacerbate
distress and social suffering, interventions are designed
with the aim to alter the social context and its inherent ineq-
uities. Psychosocial interventions are implemented at the
level of the individual, the family, the social network, the
community, and/or at the wider population to improve
health and mental health outcomes (International Federation
of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies [IFRC], 2009;
Reyes, 2006). For nonconflict settings, five broad types of
psychosocial interventions have been identified focusing
on behavioral change, social support, disease management,
distress mitigation, and control/efficacy enhancement
(Glass, 2000). A review of the currently employed extended
mental health and psychosocial support practices in human-
itarian settings shows that the most commonly used inter-
ventions are counseling, providing and facilitating
community-based social supports, structured social activi-
ties, provision of information, raising awareness, and psy-
choeducation (Tol, Barbui, etal., 2011).
For the purpose of this article, we have adopted the term
"psychosocial intervention" to refer to activities designed as
collective interventions variously labeled as "counseling,"
"psychoeducational," and/or "psychotherapeutic." These
interventions are aimed toward primary and/or secondary
prevention, as well as exerting positive influence to the course
and outcome of distress and illness, including the promotion
of resilience and effective coping with major individual chal-
lenges and social adversities. Such psychosocial interventions
ultimately aim at the resumption of normal life, facilitating
affected people's convalescence and preventing pathological
consequences of potentially traumatic or stressful situations
threatening the integrity of the lives of individuals, families,
and communities. Mollica and colleagues (2004) argue that
while psychosocial interventions are primarily concerned
with the psychological and social well-being of individuals,
they go beyond to include the repair of collective social struc-
tures. In other words, the term psychosocial implies the
dynamic relations between psychological effects (e.g., emo-
tions, behaviors, and memory) and social effects (e.g., altered
social relations as a result of loss, separation, family, and
community breakdown; Mollica etal., 2004). However, until
now little is known about the evidence base sustaining these
interventions, their effectiveness and cultural appropriate-
ness, the planning and implementation processes followed, as
well as the ways in which current practices are rendered sus-
tainable to aid the development of long-term restructuring of
mental health systems in unstable or turbulent states.
Methodology: Search Strategy and
Selection Criteria
We decided to search the scientific literature published over
the last two decades. In view of previously published meta-
analyses and systematic reviews of randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) on the evidence base of mental health interven-
tions in war and postwar contexts (McPherson, 2012; Meffert
& Ekblad, 2013; Steel etal., 2009; Tol, Barbui, etal., 2011),
we decided to avoid duplication of efforts by excluding all
RCTs and systematic reviews of RCTs and meta-analyses
from our review. Instead, we concentrated our search of the
literature on the middle and lower grades of evidence, as rep-
resented by expert opinion, observational and qualitative or
mixed-method studies, case reports, case control, and
community-based studies. We decided to sharpen our focus
even further on the most commonly used treatment modalities
in psychosocial interventions among civilian populations,
because of the reported overall scarcity of studies on psycho-
social support and best practices in humanitarian settings and
the exclusion of "psychosocial wellbeing" as an outcome in
the systematic reviews and meta-analyses already published
(Patel etal., 2007; Tol, Barbui, etal., 2011).
Another issue shaping our review is the tendency of sys-
tematic reviews of RCTs to reflect clinicians' perspectives
rather than patients'needs and community priorities for care.
In reviewing qualitative, observational, and community-
based studies, we aimed to restore patients' and community
views and priorities--as far as they were reported in the lit-
erature reviewed--thus broadening our critical perspective
to existing systematic reviews (Berkwits, 1998).
4 SAGE Open
To gain insight into these particularities, we systemati-
cally searched for references listed in the following elec-
tronic databases: PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, and
PubMed. For the search to be both sensitive and specific in
relation to our questions, we used the keywords: war AND
mental health AND trauma. Then, we combined these key-
words variously with the search terms: treatment OR mental
health interventions OR psychotherapy OR psychosocial
OR posttraumatic stress disorder OR group therapy. Each
search was, in turn, delimitated by the following criteria: (a)
the search period encompassed nearly two decades, from
January 1994 to October 2013, and (b) only articles written
in English were included. This search identified a total of
4,232 articles (see Table 1).
In addition, we searched the following journals: American
Journal of Public Health; British Journal of Psychiatry;
British Medical Journal; Disasters; Intervention:
International Journal of Mental Health, Psychological Work
and Counseling in Areas of Armed Conflict; Journal of
Nervous and Mental Disease; Medicine, Conflict and
Survival; Social Science & Medicine; The Lancet; Journal of
Traumatic Stress; and Transcultural Psychiatry. We also
searched the reference lists of particular journal articles. This
manual search resulted in 46 additional articles.
As a result, a total of 4,278 articles were screened through
a staged process. First, each electronic search was repeated to
remove duplicates and exclude articles that contained the key
words--"military," "veterans," and "refugees"--to focus the
review on studies conducted in LMICs where most of the
wars are currently raging and limit our search to adult civilian
populations. Additional reasons for excluding the above-
mentioned vulnerable populations were that (a) there already
exist a number of systematic literature reviews focusing on
mental health and psychosocial interventions directed at mili-
tary service personnel (i.e., Carlson etal., 2011; Institute of
Medicine [IOM], 2008), refugees (i.e., Crumlish & O'Rourke,
2010; Palic & Elklit, 2011), and children and adolescents (i.e.,
Jordans, Tol, Komproe, & de Jong, 2009; Tol etal., 2010; Tol,
Barbui, etal., 2011), and (b) intervention strategies directed
at these groups often follow particular designs that are not
easily comparable with those devised for adult civilian survi-
vors of armed conflict who recover in their respective

The number of records thus excluded was 2,862, leaving
us with 1,375 plus the 46 manually selected ones, totaling to
1,421 records. Second, to remove duplicate records across
databases (this could not be done electronically), we screened
the search results manually and were able to exclude another
497. The total number of excluded articles (electronic and
manual) amounted to 3,354 (see Figure 1).
A total of 924 records were then manually assessed for
eligibility. In this process, we excluded all books, book chap-
ters, and dissertations (n = 215); studies conducted among
veterans and military that had slipped through the electronic
screening (n = 55); studies on interventions conducted among
children and/or adolescents (they are currently under review
and will be published separately; n = 157); works reporting
on interventions in Western contexts (n = 37); meta-analyses
and RCTs conducted in Western and non-Western contexts
(n = 25); and epidemiological surveys reporting only on
prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
other disorders (n = 77). We further excluded studies that
were irrelevant for our review (i.e., natural disasters; n = 3), and
those that did not report on any type of intervention did not
provide output measures or were purely descriptive, concep-
tual, or theoretical (n = 215). We retained 28 full-text peer-
reviewed articles describing individual or community-based
psychosocial interventions directed at adult populations in
war and postwar contexts.
The procedure for data collection consisted of two con-
secutive rounds of independent readings conducted by the
authors. After the first round, we extracted basic information
for each study: source (journal/impact factor, author/s); tar-
get group and country; study design and research tools (case
control study, community-based intervention, pharmacother-
apy, trauma healing workshop, etc.); type of intervention
(two main categories: trauma-focused interventions and
broader psychosocial and community-based mental health
interventions) and treatment protocol adopted (i.e., nature,
content, frequency of sessions); follow-up and assessment of
outcomes; and main results. The classification adopted under
main results, expressed as beneficial or improved status,
inconclusive and/or negative, and/or general recommenda-
tions, is arbitrary and derived from the concluding remarks
or assessment made by the author/s. For example, if the
majority of treated cases were reported as an improvement or
as a symptom's relief, then the results were listed as benefi-
cial. Conversely, if the authors of a case control study
reported that "no intervention effect was found," then the
results were listed as inconclusive.
As the process of independent readings was completed by
the two readers (main author and first coauthor), we com-
pared notes to ensure reliability of the data collected among
Figure 1. Studies included in the focused and systematic review.

researchers reading the same material. Any discrepancies in
the data collected and summarized were discussed, and if
needed, the opinion of the third author was requested to gain
consensus and conciliate the interpretation of results. These
results were then organized according to categories gener-
ated from the collected material, along themes (i.e., qualita-
tive and quantitative research tools, individual and group
therapies used, ad hoc therapies, traditional healing and cop-
ing practices, etc.) and main results (i.e., beneficial, incon-
clusive, recommendations, etc.).
During the second round of readings, we performed an
in-depth selective reading and critical appraisal of the study
design, sample size, content of the intervention, provisions
for follow-up, and mental health outcomes, trying to find
supportive evidence and linkages between specific therapies
and reported results. We also included in our review quanti-
tative results, perceived barriers to treatment, and patients'
self-assessment, if any. These results were then analyzed,
and after data reduction and interpretation, we transfer it to a
data-recording matrix, which is now presented as a summary
in Table 2.
Results of the Literature Review
The literature review shows a wide range of intervention ini-
tiatives at the individual and collective level, ranging from
clinical and observational studies to community-based inter-
ventions, quasi-experimental case and control studies, and
descriptive studies outlining "real-life" interventions. The
countries in which these interventions were performed are
equally as diverse, including Algeria, Angola, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Burma, Cambodia, Congo, Croatia, Gaza and
the West Bank, Guatemala, Guinea, India, Indonesia, Iraq,
Israel, Kosovo, Liberia, Mozambique, Nepal, Rwanda,
Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.
In Table 2, we provide detailed summary information
with regard to the literature reviewed focusing on sources
(author/s and year of publication), target group and country,
study design and research tools, type of intervention, follow-
up and assessment of results/outcomes, and main results and/
or general recommendations.
The systematic review makes apparent that the study
designs are extremely diverse. The research tools used range
from validated clinical or screening questionnaires and scales
(i.e., Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], Hopkins Symptom
Checklist [HSCL], and Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview [MINI]) to focus group discussions and semistruc-
tured and open-ended interviews accordingly. The number of
community-based, observational and qualitative or mixed-
method studies (20) prevailed over quasi-experimental, case
and control study designs (8).
The literature review reveals a wide repertoire of inter-
ventions, including therapies used, ranging from various
forms of psychotherapy and psychosocial counseling (Bass
etal., 2012; K. de Jong & Kleber, 2007; Dybdahl & Pasagic,
2000; Gaboulaud et
al., 2010; Kozaric-Kovacic, Kocijan-
Hercigonja, & Jambrosic, 2002; Mooren, de Jong, Kleber, &
Ruvic, 2003) to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT; Morina,
Rushiti, Salihu, & Ford, 2010), Internet-based CBT (Wagner,
Schulz, & Knaevelsrud, 2012), narrative exposure therapy
(NET; Neuner etal., 2008), psychosocial support (Kozaric-
Kovacic etal., 2002), psychological support and assistance
during exhumations (Eppel, 2002), sociotherapy (Richters,
Dekker, & Scholte, 2008; Scholte etal., 2011), testimony
methods (Igreja, Kleijn, Schreuder, van Dijk, & Verschuur,
2004), psychopharmacological agents and counseling
(Nakimuli-Mpungu etal., 2013; Somasundaram, van de Put,
Eisenbruch, & de Jong, 1999), community-based mental
health services and psychosocial interventions (Agani,
Landau, & Agani, 2010; Anckermann etal., 2005; Johnson,
Shala, Sejdijaj, Odell, & Dabishevci, 2001; Mooren etal.,
2003; Somasundaram etal., 1999; Sonderegger, Rombouts,
Ocen, & McKeever, 2011; Walstrom etal., 2013), and mixed
Western and/or traditional healing practices (Eppel, 2002;
Mercer, Ager, & Ruwanpura, 2005; Somasundaram etal.,
1999; Stark, 2006; Stepakoff, Hubbard, & Katoh, 2006).
While the review shows a gamut of collective interventions
employed worldwide, it also reveals discrepancies between
different authors regarding treatment goals and best practices
to deal with trauma-related emotional distress and mental
disorders. In fact, considering the extreme diversity of treat-
ment approaches used, it seems that we are far from reaching
consensus to date regarding effective psychosocial interven-
tions in the early and/or late phases of exposure to traumatic
experiences. Our findings are supported by other literature
reviews that have pointed to the fact that there exists substan-
tial variance among researchers, mental health experts, first
responders, clinicians, and practitioners over the best prac-
tices and an overall lack of evidence for interventions aimed
at reducing the mental health burden in war-torn and postwar
societies (Allden etal., 2009; Gersons & Olff, 2005; Hobfoll
etal., 2007; Miller & Rasmussen, 2010; Patel etal., 2007;
Tol, Barbui, etal., 2011).
According to the type of intervention, it is worth noting
trauma-focused interventions are a clear minority (Fuertes,
2004; Mooren etal., 2003), which leaves most interventions
listed above addressing broader psychosocial and community-
based mental health issues. These can be grouped as follows:
About half of all interventions consist of psychosocial sup-
port, counseling, and psychoeducation, including CBT and
NET, applied as therapies to groups and/or individuals (13).
Smaller numbers are represented by ethno-cultural
approaches, using traditional healing and coping practices
either alone or mixed up with Western treatment practices
(5), such as exhumations and reburials as catalysts for heal-
ing and reconciliation (Eppel, 2002), Tibetan and Western-
based clinical consultations (Mercer etal., 2005), treatment
model blending Western psychodynamic therapy with
African practices in Liberia and Sierra Leone (Stepakoff
etal., 2006), relaxation techniques and referral to traditional

etal., 2011), Internet-based CBT (Wagner etal., 2012), and

and only two listed as combined psychotherapy plus pharma-
cological treatment (Nakimuli-Mpungu et
al., 2013;
Somasundaram etal., 1999).
Irrespective of the type of intervention, 20 of them show
results of follow-up studies, though the majority are immedi-
ate or short-term assessments following the intervention.
Longitudinal, long-term assessments of mental health out-
comes, and overall impact in the quality of life and well-
being of survivors and/or intended beneficiaries are by in
large missing. The absence of longitudinal data impoverishes
further the reporting of results of the clinical encounter or
intended intervention. Nevertheless, the majority of the stud-
ies (18) show beneficial or improved outcomes of the inter-
vention, or were at least able to transform results into general
recommendations. A smaller number (10) of all reviewed
studies reported inconclusive results. We believe that the
claimed results need to be taken with caution as most studies
included in our review have no control groups and, therefore,
the evidence shown is potentially weak and fails to demon-
strate that the treatments chosen for the various conditions
are more (or less) effective than natural recovery. It should
be further acknowledged that in spite of the reported results,
we are still lacking clinical evidence from the literature
reviewed about (a) who should (or should not) receive spe-
cialized treatment when confronted with psychological
trauma; (b) what kind of intervention is best to be prescribed
and what should be the optimal duration of treatment; and
finally (c) how and why a clinical intervention may work in
some cases and not in others (Mollica etal., 2004; Shalev,
2002; Yehuda & Hyman, 2005).
Another finding of the review is that there seems to be a
tacit agreement among the reviewed authors about the impor-
tance of designing psychosocial interventions and evaluation
strategies in culturally appropriate ways to serve conflict-
affected populations effectively. However, a closer look
reveals that cultural adaptation is carried out and described to
varying degrees. Six studies outline psychosocial interven-
tions that were developed from the ground up by local experts
or the involvement of religious leaders, traditional healers,
and the wider community (Anckermann etal., 2005; Doucet
& Denov, 2012; Eppel, 2002; Mercer et
al., 2005; Stark,
2006; Stepakoff etal., 2006). The resulting intervention strat-
egies are described as differing significantly from strategies
developed in Western settings as they are shaped by specific
belief and value structures, supported by local resources, and
embedded into the available, albeit limited, infrastructure.
For instance, Doucet and Denov (2012) delineate particular
strategies with which social workers in Sierra Leone sup-
ported war-affected women and girls and highlight the
importance
to advocate for supporting local capacities, as well as the
inclusion of local helpers in internationally-funded programs,
which will not only benefit war-affected individuals, but also
will help rebuild the social capital networks that may have been
damaged by the conflict. (pp. 623-624).
Another example is the use of symbolic cleansing rituals for
spiritual pollution ("noro"), and ceremonial gestures of rec-
onciliation, resulting in significant improvement of mental
health status, as perceived by elimination of symptoms,
improved emotions and stigma reduction among girls
exposed to atrocities of war, and sexual abuse and rape in
Sierra Leone (Stark, 2006).
Five of the reviewed studies thoroughly describe cultur-
ally informed approaches to treatment by outlining how
Western approaches to care were modified through the inclu-
sion of local resources; values, beliefs, and rituals; and medi-
ation and relaxation techniques (Agani etal., 2010; Doucet
& Denov, 2012; Mercer etal., 2005; Somasundaram etal.,
1999; Stark, 2006). However, the majority of studies (14)
only claim to have adapted their intervention strategies in
culturally informed ways without providing any further
information. Typical statements are as follows: "The psycho-
dynamic approach of trauma . . . was adapted by experts in
trans-cultural psychiatry to the Palestinian culture"
(Gaboulaud etal., 2010, p. 132); "During the training both
trauma experts and participants adapted intervention tech-
niques to the local culture" (K. de Jong, Kleber, & Puratic,
2003, p. 20); and "The programme combined an evidence
based CBT framework, in conjunction with culturally sensi-
tive and culturally relevant knowledge and activities"
(Sonderegger etal., 2011, p. 241). None of these studies fur-
ther explain what cultural adaptation entails, how it can be
achieved, and what the benefits or challenges of such an
approach are. Last, four studies make no reference to culture
or social adaptations (Igreja etal., 2004; Morina etal., 2010;
Priebe etal., 2010; Walstrom etal., 2013) and, out of these,
two critically reflect on this as an omission. Igreja and col-
leagues (2004) note,
The standardized way in which the participants were expected to
give their answers proved to be problematic . . . [and] it was very
difficult to find meaningful words or phrases in the local
language for several other concepts related to "affect,"
"remembering," "hearing" and "thinking." (p. 256)
On the contrary, Morina etal. (2010) reflect that to achieve
better treatment results, it would have been important to
adapt evidence-based treatment for survivors of war "based
on their culture and life circumstances in order to recover
from PTSD and experience general emotional relief" (p. 79).
Pedersen et al. 15
Finally, it is interesting to note that not a single study
included in this review has acknowledged the various interna-
tional best-practice guidelines currently available. In part, this
may be due to the fact that about half (13 out of 28) of the
studies were conducted before international guidelines were
made widely available. However, as early as 2000, the Red
Cross World Disaster Report sharply criticized international
mental health initiatives and issued a call for standards to bet-
ter structure relief and humanitarian efforts (IFRC, 2000).
Since then, a growing number of international guidelines have
been launched, such as the recently published Building Back
Better report (WHO, 2013), the IASC (2007) guidelines, the
Sphere Project (2004), the WHO (2003) report on Mental
Health in Emergencies, the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH; 2002) report on Mental Health and Mass Violence,
and the Guidelines for International Training in mental health
and psychosocial interventions (Weine etal., 2002).All guide-
lines have specifically included agreed upon recommenda-
tions for the provision of psychological "first aid" and mental
health care as part of humanitarian assistance efforts (Kienzler
& Pedersen, 2012).
Notwithstanding attempts to find the middle ground and
set up standards for minimum psychosocial interventions,
health care providers and frontline practitioners still criticize
the application of such standardized interventions, and their
effectiveness continues to be contested based on the argu-
ments that they reflect both the experts' opinions and the
general common sense, but most often the recommended
interventions are insufficiently tested in real-field situations
and little evidence of effectiveness or fitness-for-purpose
exists (Gaboulaud etal., 2010; Litz, Gray, Bryant, & Adler,
2002; Lopes Cardoso, 2008; Rose, Bisson, & Wessely, 2003;
Sensky, 2003).
Discussion
The consequences of exposure to intentional violence such
as armed conflict and war are compounded by multiple fac-
tors. Researchers and practitioners remain divided along a
continuum as to the psychopathological effects attributable
to the traumatic experience. While some tend to minimize
the psychological needs of individuals exposed to traumatic
experiences, others assume all of the exposed, including vic-
tims and survivors, are in need of psychosocial assistance,
including treatment and rehabilitation services. Depending
on the particular outlook, the planning and delivery of psy-
chosocial interventions are therefore differently organized as
well as the nature and content of the interventions remain
strongly influenced by the context and an array of individual
and collective factors, including resources available and
funding sources. Furthermore, as explained in the
"Introduction" section, the delivery of mental health and
psychosocial support is today no longer solely in the hands
of governmental or multilateral agencies. Instead, NGOs, the
private sector, religious-driven relief and advocacy
organizations, and, more recently, the military and security
companies are gradually assuming a pivotal role in conduct-
ing psychosocial interventions at various levels, under the
label of humanitarian assistance (Joachim & Schneiker,
2012; Kienzler & Pedersen, 2012). These agencies and their
actors, which are mostly based in high-income countries,
usually promote off-the-shelf Western-based therapeutic
intervention strategies, which are seldom properly adapted to
the needs and expectations of potential recipients and benefi-
ciaries, which in turn come from a highly diverse social and
cultural range of LMICs and war-torn societies worldwide
(Belgrad & Namias, 1997; Bracken & Petty, 1998; Locke,
2012; Tol, Patel, etal., 2011; Weiss etal., 2003).
Given these complexities, we decided to address some of
these issues by organizing our discussion under the three sets
of questions guiding our focused and systematic review of
the literature, as postulated in the "Introduction" section to
this article.
1. What are the existing paradigms supporting psycho-
social interventions in medical and humanitarian ini-
tiatives aimed at reducing the mental health burden
of civilian populations in conflict and postconflict
settings?
Despite the apparent consensus regarding the need for
evidence-based psychosocial interventions in conflict and
postconflict situations, our literature review reveals the coex-
istence of competing paradigms among scholars and practi-
tioners, unveiling a multiplicity of approaches with respect to
individual and collective best practices in planning, conduct-
ing, and evaluating psychosocial interventions. There are
those who seem to favor a narrower application, so-called
"trauma-focused intervention," addressing distress and
trauma primarily within medical or psychological paradigms
targeting individuals with protocols for screening, diagnosis,
and treatment (Bass etal., 2012; de Jong & Kleber, 2007;
Dybdahl & Pasagic, 2000; Igreja etal., 2004; Johnson etal.,
2001; Wagner etal., 2012). Yet, others advocate the applica-
tion of wider, more comprehensive psychosocial approaches,
targeting communities and, at times, individuals at risk,
adopting a "bricolage" of different therapeutic and psychoso-
cial paradigms (Anckermann et
al., 2005; de Jong & van
Ommeren, 2002; Doucet & Denov, 2012; Eppel, 2002;
Mercer etal., 2005; Somasundaram etal., 1999; Stark, 2006).
Miller and Rasmussen (2010) postulate that fundamen-
tally different assumptions underlie these two main
approaches: For trauma-focused advocates, the critical factor
involved in the causality chain is the single and direct expo-
sure to a traumatic event, a belief which in turn is fueled by
the growing clinical field of psychotraumatology. In con-
trast, for those grouped as supportive of a wider psychosocial
approach, the attribution of causality focuses primarily on
the overall stressful social and material conditions caused or
worsened by armed conflict and war, including other prior or
16 SAGE Open
coexisting conditions such as extreme poverty, poor housing,
and food insecurity, and/or those derived from internal dis-
placement and refugee status often resulting in stigmatiza-
tion, social exclusion, and partial or total loss of social and
material support.
Inspired by the Cambodian survivors of the Pol Pot period
(1975-1979), Hinton and Good (2015a) have postulated what
may be seen as a new paradigm or theoretical framework com-
bining three analytic approaches: (a) a multiaxial approach
(with 11 analytic perspectives ranging from biology to the
nature of trauma to the social context), (b) a "typology of
errors" that should be avoided to evaluate trauma in a cultur-
ally sensitive fashion, and (c) the "multiplex models" to show
how trauma symptoms are generated through biocultural
mechanisms, and how trauma results in episodes of distress.
These may be seen as useful tools in examining trauma-related
disorders across different cultures, where local trauma ontolo-
gies may be delineated and the cross-cultural study of these
ontologies advanced (Hinton & Good, 2015b). Through these
three analytic approaches, the researcher thus becomes aware
of key processes to target in psychosocial interventions that
seek to alleviate distress and build resilience of individuals
and communities affected by conflict and war.
Going back to our discussion on "Results of the Literature
Review" section, we are not implying that diverse--and at
times competing paradigms--as well as the emerging multi-
plicity of approaches followed by the different authors
included in this review are necessarily counterproductive,
but this variability may simply reflect, on one hand, the dif-
ferent disciplinary backgrounds of public health experts,
researchers, and practitioners involved and, on the other, the
need to adapt and accommodate the intervention to the mul-
tidimensional approaches discussed above and the ever-
changing contexts, the variable socioeconomic position of
survivors, the polymorphic cultural expression of symptoms
of distress, and the heterogeneity of trauma-related disorders
(Young & Breslau, 2015), all of which defy or interfere with
efforts for standardization of clinical diagnostic tools and
therapeutic protocols.
2. What are the main implementation gaps in the deliv-
ery of medical and psychosocial interventions? On
what kind of evidence are practices currently based?
Through our systematic review, we discerned at least four
main implementation gaps:
First, the effective delivery of medical and psychosocial
interventions imply the timely identification of cases (case
finding) and the provision of services to people identified as
positives (true cases), who are at greatest need for conditions
or disorders for which proven therapies exist. In most psycho-
social interventions conducted in humanitarian settings,
including the ones under review, "active" case finding is rare,
but cases are usually identified by symptom checklists applied
to persons demanding services at the point of delivery. The
screening of symptoms or triage does not necessarily make up
for a diagnosis, and therefore an unknown number of "false
positives" may be misdiagnosed and prescribed a superfluous
or unnecessary treatment. As explained above, we are still
lacking enough evidence as to who should (or should not)
receive specialized treatment when confronted with massive
psychological trauma (Shalev, 2002; 2007).
It has been further acknowledged the lack of evidence on
the efficacy of most psychotherapeutic modalities applied in
humanitarian settings (Lopes Cardoso, 2008; Patel et
al.,
2007; Roberts, Kitchiner, Kenardy, & Bisson, 2009), includ-
ing the inefficatious, but also potentially harmful, critical
incident stress debriefing (Litz & Gibson, 2006; Litz etal.,
2002; Watson et
al., 2003). Practitioners in the field of
humanitarian assistance largely agree that despite the pleth-
ora of available treatment options, there remains an absence
of a solid evidence base for most mental health and psycho-
social support interventions (Allden etal., 2009). A similar
claim was raised by the IOM, in their report following a sys-
tematic review of the scientific evidence on treatment modal-
ities for PTSD among war veterans. The IOM report states
that for all drug classes and specific drugs reviewed in each
of the classes, the evidence is inadequate to determine effi-
cacy in the treatment of PTSD among war veterans. With
regard to psychotherapies, the report states that only for
exposure therapies (i.e., CBT), there is sufficient evidence to
conclude its efficacy in the treatment of PTSD (IOM, 2008).
Despite these assertions, most interventions included in
this focused and systematic review have used one or other
form of psychotherapeutic treatment protocol. Most of these
interventions claim to have had beneficial or improved out-
comes--expressed as symptom reduction--more often than
failure. This may be explained by the fact that absence of evi-
dence for a given treatment does not necessarily mean it is
inefficacious. However, the qualification of beneficial has
been most often made with a before and after design for which
the reliability of the measures used for symptom reduction is
likely to be low (Type II error), and in most cases of such
exposure to extreme traumatic experiences, the remission of
symptoms may be a long and often unattainable treatment goal
(Marshall, Davidson, & Yehuda, 1998; Shalev, 2002).
In addition, people surviving exposure to armed conflict
and war are expected to experience at least one, if not more
than one, morbid condition, and for many, comorbidity is the
norm. In stark contrast, the trauma-focused interventions
reviewed here are aimed to deal with single morbid condi-
tions and tend to separate mental and physical health care,
disregarding the principle of providing integrated care for
both aspects of collective health (Gunn, 2015).
Second, it is also noteworthy that in most of the reviewed
studies, neither early detection nor early interventions were
conducted, and with a few exceptions, we could find no refer-
ences to the timeline between the initial assessment, the actual
intervention, and the claimed postintervention response. As
stated above in the presentation of results, we are still unsure
Pedersen et al. 17
as to what kind of intervention is best and what should be the
optimal duration of treatment, as well as how and why a clini-
cal intervention seems to work in some cases and not in others
(Shalev, 2002; Yehuda & Hyman, 2005).
In spite of the various forms of individual therapy avail-
able (whether proven effective or not), most reported inter-
ventions outlined the provision of psychotherapy, trauma
counseling, or general psychological support, with little
attempts to measure or systematically validate treatment out-
comes. For the most part, therapeutic aims remained ambig-
uous, as some focused on distress mitigation and others
focused on management of trauma-related disorders or
symptom relief and reduction, as measured by self-reports or
symptom checklists or improved daily functioning. In the
review, we still remain uncertain of the mutative factors that
lead to positive outcomes in some cases, but not in others.
While it is possible that the mental health burden in the
early phase of conflict or postconflict might be partly reduced
by medication and brief exposure therapy, in the case of pro-
tracted violence and enduring social disruption, such focused
interventions are bound to have limited impact. Moreover,
the preventive efficacy of debriefing in trauma-related disor-
ders has not yet been clearly demonstrated (Bisson, 2003;
Rose etal., 2003). While most reported individual or group
interventions consisted of periodic (i.e., weekly) sessions,
thus avoiding an abbreviated course, eight psychosocial
interventions did not specify the number of sessions con-
ducted during the implementation phase.
In addition, while most interventions were described as
psychosocial or used psychodynamic principles (counseling,
CBT, NET, etc.), only two studies (Nakimuli-Mpungu etal.,
2013; Somasundaram etal., 1999) reported having used psy-
chotropic medications in conducting their clinical interven-
tion, in combination with other therapies, with beneficial
results on the first study, but inconclusive on the second.
Typically, most reviewed interventions were cross-sectional,
with no provisions made for medium- or long-term follow-up,
which severely limits the understanding of long-term effects
of exposure to violence and the process of natural recovery.
Third, planning and conducting a clinical intervention as
part of medical and humanitarian aid cannot be separated
from the context, the social and cultural realities of the fam-
ily and the community. Informed by systemic and wider
social agendas, the clinical team should be able to antici-
pate what may be harmful, neutral, or helpful and preserve
the needed therapeutic flexibility. Recovery from acute
trauma unfolds within a given context which often includes
other severe daily stressors derived from overall insecurity,
unresolved grief, and the adversities created by poverty,
social exclusion, and the social breakdown, or severe attri-
tion of social support networks (Kirmayer, Guzder, &
Rousseau, 2013).
Several of the studies reviewed here reveal that it would
be rather simplistic to regard survivors of armed conflict and
war as passive repositories of negative psychological
experiences and effects. However, the dynamic interaction of
endogenous protective factors at play, such as resilience, and
their influence in the process of healing, coping, and natural
recovery was rarely mentioned, let alone discussed in the lit-
erature reviewed.
This lapse or omission may reflect an earlier treatment
focus on trauma psychopathology while relatively recent
emerging notions on resilience capacity, posttraumatic
growth, and positive coping were still little known and were
not a part of common practices (Almedom, 2005; Monnier &
Hobfoll, 2000; Ruiz-Casares, Guzder, Rousseau, &
Kirmayer, 2013; Ungar etal., 2007). A comparative study on
bereavement conducted among Chinese and U.S adults con-
cluded that resilience does not necessarily have the same
meanings and raised questions whether or not different cul-
tures may learn from each other about coping with traumatic
experiences and extreme adversity (Bonanno, Papa, Lalande,
Nanping, & Noll, 2005; Hinton, Hinton, Pich, Loeum, &
Pollack, 2009). As there may be a link between personality
and resilient outcomes, resilient traits may be something
"relatively fixed" and therefore not easily taught or trans-
ferred to others (Bonanno, 2010), and resilience paradigms
such as "mindfulness" may require training and special skills
to be effectively transported across cultures and meaning
systems.
The promotion of resilience appears to be a clear aim in at
least one case study of the literature review. This study was
conducted by Agani (University of Pristina) and U.S.-based
collaborators, in postwar Kosovo (see Agani etal., 2010).
The Linking Human Systems (LINC) Community Resilience
Model was grounded in indigenous resources, and family-
focused and community-based interventions culturally
adapted and modified to the Kosovar situation. The aim of
this type of community intervention was to build resilience
and empowerment by creating linkages at various levels of
the social network, and make it highly participatory, with
reduced long-term professional involvement and sustainable
over time.
Fourth, there is a persistent gap between the local cultural
expressions of distress and the PTSD construct held by
Western-based mental health professionals, usually assigned
to conduct psychosocial interventions such as the ones under
review here. The nosologies of PTSD are problematic when
applied across cultures, because emic studies suggest that the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual model of PTSD is not con-
gruent with most trauma-related mental health constructs
around the world (Bracken, 1998; Hinton & Good, 2015b;
Kienzler, 2008; Pedersen, Tremblay, Errazuriz, & Gamarra,
2008; Rasmussen, Keatley, & Joscelyne, 2014).
Substantial cross-cultural variation appears to exist
reflecting diagnostic and symptomatic heterogeneity and no
clear coherence on what constitutes symptoms of PTSD
across different cultures (Hinton & Good, 2015b). Rasmussen
etal. (2014) found clusters of trauma symptoms cannot be
distinguished by trauma versus chronic stress and loss, and
18 SAGE Open
that while avoidance is conceptualized as psychopathology
in the PTSD symptom list, it has no discriminant validity
linking it with impairment and may operate positively as a
coping mechanism post trauma or a culturally reinforced
defense strategy. The multiple sociocultural levels involved
in this process may indeed inform and shape the fluidity of
symptom construction and interpretation, which are essential
ingredients for conducting a clinical intervention and assess-
ing success or failure of treatment (Kirmayer, Lemelson, &
Barad, 2007).
3. In light of the above, which are considered best prac-
tices in individual and collective interventions aimed
at civilian populations exposed to armed conflict and
war?
We must first acknowledge that developing a clinical
evaluative framework for assessing individual and collective
interventions among civilian populations in conflict and
postconflict scenarios is extremely challenging, given the
complexity of mass trauma, the heterogeneity of trauma and
its victims, and the array of possible outcomes most inter-
ventions potentially have (Shalev, 2006). In clinical natural-
istic studies, it may be difficult to attribute improvement to a
given set of treatment practices, without randomization and
controls to compare with. In this case, the final outcome of
treatment may be influenced by other intervening factors, not
necessarily strictly related to the treatment itself. Carefully
designed psychosocial interventions studies are expensive
and complex undertakings, requiring careful planning, clear
definition of expected outcomes, and a solid evaluation
design (Glass, 2000), conditions which are seldom applica-
ble because of hectic and at times chaotic prevailing field
conditions in conflict or postconflict settings.
Reports from clinical work conducted in recent war sce-
narios, where local populations were exposed to massive
traumatic experiences--such as in Sri Lanka--indicate that
meaning and narrative associated with trauma-related symp-
toms are culturally embedded (Somasundaram & Sivayokan,
2013) and further complicated by the often-neglected issues
of history, identity, power, and gender. Local practitioners
are fully aware of these intricate complexities, while foreign
experts, clinicians, and first responders most often recruited
and trained elsewhere remain oblivious to these issues.
Moreover, the clinical management of trauma-related com-
plaints among different cultures from our own, present clini-
cians with complex problems and demand clinical decisions
that are extremely challenging. As symptoms are embedded
in local systems of meaning and specific cultural explanatory
frameworks, clinicians may have difficulties in understand-
ing reactions and patients' explanatory models, healing prac-
tices, and coping behaviors. The clinical interpretation of
these interactive systems requires a solid knowledge of the
local culture and their language, and the native taxonomies,
including the local idioms of distress, local attributions of
causality, and healing traditions (Abramowitz, 2010;
Kirmayer etal., 2013; Pedersen, Kienzler, & Gamarra, 2010;
Somasundaram & Sivayokan, 2013).
Nevertheless, despite the many limitations and constraints
encountered in the literature reviewed, a number of
approaches and actions were revealed as desirable or poten-
tially useful in leading to best practices. The psychosocial
interventions that were reported as beneficial were most
often associated with the following features: (a) a primary
concern in identifying those persons at risk and in greatest
need for service (screening); (b) an implicit commitment to
avoid inflicting further damage, while ensuring minimal dis-
ruption of existing (and still sufficient) coping and protective
influences; (c) gaining in-depth insight, identifying specific
cultural resources at the local level: local idioms of distress,
healing practices (i.e., therapeutic rituals), and ways of cop-
ing with distress (i.e., symbolic as well as culturally signifi-
cant ways of restoring social cohesion, religious practices,
etc.); (d) building on the existing endogenous resources (i.e.,
key informants, healers, religious traditions, etc.) rather than
exclusive reliance on external solutions of poor social rele-
vance and cultural consonance; and (e) promoting empower-
ment using participatory action research approaches, where
the community of actors and survivors is involved from the
early stages of every assessment and/or intended action or
proposition for strengthening social cohesion and increasing
resiliency, including the provision of psychological support.
The systematic and focused review of the literature (see,
for example, Agani etal., 2010; Anckermann etal., 2005; K.
de Jong & Kleber, 2007; Doucet & Denov, 2012; Eppel, 2002;
Keough & Samuels, 2004; Mercer etal, 2005; Stark, 2006;
Stepakoff etal., 2006) clearly shows improved or better men-
tal health outcomes when community resources and survivors
were involved in the decisions regarding the support to be
offered, Western and non-Western local cultural practices
were sensitively combined, and activation and mobilization of
local social support networks such as symbolic restoration of
collective processes (i.e., for bereavement and grieving) were
achieved, accompanied by the more general psychosocial sup-
port, including follow-up at later stages.
In a recently published book on Tamil populations in
Northern Sri Lanka, Somasundaram (2014) makes a compel-
ling case in favor of indigenous coping strategies and cultur-
ally mediated protective factors like rituals, funerals, and
religious ceremonies, as crucial sources of collective
strength, support, and meaning. Culture-specific relaxation
techniques, such as the use of meaningful words according to
different religions (Hindu, Buddhist, Islam, Catholic, etc.),
combined with meditation, breathing exercises, andAyurveda
or Siddha oil massages and muscular relaxation, represent
culture-specific powerful tools for healing massive trauma
and strengthening positive resilience and collective coping
strategies among the Tamils.
Other additional measures which may be considered no
less important, but complementary to the best practices
Pedersen et al. 19
pointed above, have been postulated by Hobfoll and collabo-
rators (2007) under the general title of "best intervention
practices," aimed at strengthening stress management and
promote resiliency, as well as a series of supportive measures
to restore the sense of safety, calm, self- and collective effi-
cacy, connectedness, and hope (Hobfoll etal., 2007). Some
but not all of these practices were used in the reviewed litera-
ture (see, for example, Agani etal., 2010; Anckermann etal.,
2005; K. de Jong & Kleber, 2007; Doucet & Denov, 2012;
Eppel, 2002; Mercer etal., 2005).
Finally, the discrepancies that have been made evident
between some of the "recommended" best practices and the
imperatives of conducting psychosocial interventions and
clinical work on the ground arise from the vast divide exist-
ing between researchers, academic psychiatrists, and front-
line clinicians (Litz & Gibson, 2006). Moreover, it becomes
apparent that there is a crucial imbalance in the reviewed
studies to effectively bridge the gulf that exists between
research and action, or in other words between "what is
known and what is done in practice, between scientific
achievements and health realization" (Pang, Pablos-
Mendez, & Ijsselmuiden, 2004, p. 720; Haines, Kuruvilla,
& Borchert, 2004).
Limitations of the Study
The potential for selection bias in this literature review is
acknowledged. A large number of humanitarian assistance
initiatives conducted by multilateral and bilateral agencies,
including international agencies, governments, and NGOs,
are at risk of being underrepresented in our review.
Assessments and research findings generated by such orga-
nizations are most often to be found in the gray literature, in
nonindexed reports, or on websites or other media. Children,
refugees, veterans, and the military were excluded and there-
fore are not at all represented in our review.
The results that are published in peer-reviewed journals
are mostly interventions funded and conducted by foreign
nationals, with variable support and actual engagement of
local practitioners or researchers, which introduces the risk
of bias in detriment of the latter. Consequently, there is a lack
of recognition of existing local knowledge production and
dissemination efforts by practitioners and researchers from
LMICs, who are also underrepresented. The insufficient or
limited participation of local practitioners and researchers
may explain the limited follow-up and poor sustainability of
most initiatives reviewed here.
Finally, as shown above, because some studies were
unclear as to the methodology or research design used,
lacked details on the content and duration of the interven-
tions, and did not specify the training received and degree of
professionalization of participating health workers and prac-
titioners, the risks of misinterpretation remain moderate to
high. At the same time, this also points to the fact that inno-
vative approaches to research, capacity building, and
knowledge translation are needed to achieve effective and
sustainable psychosocial interventions in contexts affected
by armed conflict and war.
Concluding Remarks
To summarize our main findings, we would like to raise four
key issues of critical importance when considering psycho-
social interventions and searching for best practices in con-
flict and postconflict situations.
First, while the concept of trauma in a given population
after exposure to traumatic events appears to be universal, it
has been described and experienced in many different ways
across cultures and specific populations throughout the past
few decades (Hinton & Good, 2015b). The metamorphosis
and the ever-expanding and inclusive definition of the trauma
construct have made the objective assessment of its exis-
tence problematic and one should exercise caution when try-
ing to measure its occurrence and persistence over time in a
given population. This "over inclusiveness" has been criti-
cized by practitioners who point to the importance of distin-
guishing between what constitutes a normal versus an
abnormal or pathological reaction to experienced life threat-
ening circumstances (Horwitz, 2007).
The review of the literature shows that most interventions
conducted in conflict and postconflict settings are bound to
miss, distort, or transform the local idioms of the victims
while translating local expressions into professional lan-
guages of complaint and restitution, which in turn are appro-
priated by donors and humanitarian organizations for
political and moral purposes (Kleinman, Das, & Lock, 1997).
Second, as it has been stated by Shalev (2006), the inter-
face between "stress theory" and the theories of "psychologi-
cal trauma" has not been convincingly articulated. This have
created additional ambiguities when distinguishing distress
from disorder and introduced competing and even contradic-
tory diagnostic and treatment practices, which are evident in
the implementation gaps noted above. There is little doubt
that the complexity of mass trauma and its aftermath, as well
as the relative lack of theorization, have both hindered the
quality of responses and efficacy of the interventions and
therefore remained an obstacle to the emergence of best
practices for wider application. First, responders and the
medical and allied professions are still confronted with a lack
of sound theoretical platform that would provide a rationale
for the link between exposure, the psychosocial mechanism,
and the end point of interest, introducing uncertainties and
constraints in the model of clinical practice, as well as in the
individual and collective interventions derived from it
(Glass, 2000).
Third, our review of the qualitative literature ratifies to a
large extent, what has been reported by Tol, Barbui, etal.
(2011) in their meta-analysis of RCTs conducted in humani-
tarian settings, that most interventions had no reliable base-
line data against which to measure progress, lacked specific
20 SAGE Open
outcome measures for assessing effectiveness, and did not
specify length of time between exposure to traumatic experi-
ences, initiation, and duration of treatment, thus limiting the
analysis and interpretation of the findings. The various inter-
vention designs reviewed here failed to specify the interven-
tion target and expected outcomes in unambiguous terms and
therefore both outcomes and impact remained difficult to
assess systematically. Under these conditions, it is unlikely
that some of the reviewed psychosocial interventions left
behind a significant and durable impact on current local
interventions and the model of clinical practice.
Fourth, the collected qualitative evidence does not sup-
port a specific intervention model nor a set of standardized
best practices but reiterates the need for psychosocial inter-
ventions to remain flexible and adaptable to the prevailing
social and cultural context and specific circumstances of the
massive traumatic experience (Hobfoll etal., 2007; Shalev,
2002; Silove et
al., 2014; Silove & Steel, 2006;
Somasundaram,2014;Summerfield,2004).Notwithstanding,
the literature review shows some promising pathways to fol-
low, which may incrementally contribute to build-up empiri-
cal evidence for more efficacious, compassionate, and
sustainable interventions across the response chain. These
include devising more sensitive tools for screening, early
detection, and treatment of those in need, discarding "man-
datory" Western-driven interventions, which are irrelevant,
unwelcomed, or not required (Ørner & Schnyder, 2003). We
need to develop culturally appropriate interventions, includ-
ing local practices to promote resilience and strengthen the
process of natural healing and coping mechanisms, as well as
focus our attention on both primary and secondary preven-
tion domains, which are most often missing.
All of these key issues need careful consideration to
develop preventive measures and early interventions for
reducing chronicity and the overall burden of illness among
survivors. In addition, in the mid- and long term, we need to
move beyond the narrow psychological scope to restore the
sense of safety, equity, and justice, while promoting agency
and social cohesion among survivors. Aiming to normaliza-
tion and resumption of everyday life, with the ultimate aim
of reconstructing the social tissue, while, reducing inequali-
ties, addressing social injustices, and rebuilding of local
economies, appears to be the most appropriate course of
action to prevent recurrent and endemic conflict and improve
the overall mental health status of the affected populations.
Overall, the findings reported in this review are to some
extent unexpected and may resonate well with scholars who
have criticized a strictly medicalized model of care, by sys-
tematically offering psychiatric counseling and psychologi-
cal support to people who have been exposed to traumatic
experiences despite they may not be in need of professional
care or assistance (Almedom & Summerfield, 2004; Jones,
2002). At the same time, it should reinforce the need for fur-
ther research and innovation in the delivery of psychosocial
support for those who just claim that the current responses
are a rather insufficient or an "imperfect offering," dispro-
portionate to the magnitude of social suffering, despair and
hopelessness survivors of mass trauma are confronted with
(Orbinski, 1988).
The future global mental health research agenda should
be focusing not only on the short-term impact but also the
long-term impact on those exposed to intentional and pro-
tracted violence and traumatic events. We need to move
beyond cross-sectional studies and refocus our attention to
prioritize research on naturalistic and longitudinal studies of
the clinical trajectory of posttraumatic adaptation as well as
risk and resilience factors involved, acknowledging the mul-
tiple outcomes of trauma exposure. Moreover, we need to
continue searching for new ways of preventing violence and
conflict, reduce its sequelae and the short- as well as long-
term health burden, while addressing social inequalities and
pressing issues of social justice.
Finally, turning to the general area of intervention research
in conflict and postconflict settings, the growing multidisci-
plinarity of research teams, the diversity of research para-
digms and approaches, as well as the tensions between
frontline health workers and clinicians, humanitarian agen-
cies, donors, and researchers represent some of the main
challenges to conducting intervention research. These issues
need to be specifically addressed, especially in resource-poor
countries with ethical and cultural frames of reference differ-
ing from Eurocentric Western paradigms.
In this focused and systematic literature review, we con-
clude that in spite of the many discrepancies and inconsisten-
cies found, there is an emergent literature of positive
empirical evidence being accumulated, derived not only
from RCTs and meta-analysis but also from observational
and qualitative studies, case reports, and community-based
studies, including specialized reports and guidelines. There
is sufficient critical input derived from these studies to sup-
port the continuing assessment, revision, and refinement of
current and future guidelines for best practices in the provi-
sion of psychosocial care. This process of knowledge trans-
fer should follow a rigorous scientific design and careful
assessment of mental health outcomes, and subject to sys-
tematic field testing prior to its application. The ultimate aim
would be not only the strengthening of humanitarian assis-
tance policies and programs and improved psychosocial care
for civilian populations in conflict and postconflict settings
but should result in increasing the value and reducing the
waste of psychosocial intervention research prevailing today.
