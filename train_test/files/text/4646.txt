The Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO,
1946) states, "The enjoyment of the highest attainable stan-
dard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every
human being without distinction of race, religion, political
belief, economic or social condition."(p. 1) Based on this
statement, health may be attributed to a range of underlying
human values. And, indeed, it can be treated as a basic
resource whose quality determines the usefulness of human
life and the nature of individual's participation in social life.
But when we take into account the sociocultural side of
health phenomenon, it becomes clear that at different stages
of social development there were different health discourses,
or historically variable types of health culture. The defining
set of health factors, health definition itself, as well as the
general value of health had been changing over the pass of
epochs. Throughout civilizing process, the idea of health as a
completely deterministic external condition (health as a
faith) changed by the vision of health as a result of each indi-
vidual's personal choice. Initially, the responsibility for
health fell on various natural and supernatural forces of
exogenous nature; however, modern society tends to blame
individuals and their lifestyles for what is happening with
their health. For instance, according to a modern point of
view, individual health is by 60% dependent on the lifestyle
(Lalonde, 1981). Figure 1 illustrates this vision with respect
to health risk factors admitted by the WHO.
Admittedly, modern people by themselves tend to assume
that they really do influence on the way their lives go. For
instance, the latest available European Value Study (EVS)
data show that more than 58% of people gave the Score 7, 8,
9, or 10 when answering the question "How much control
over your life?" where 0 meant "none at all" and 10 stood for
"a great deal" (European Value Study Wave 4 Data, 2008).
Moreover, contemporary health discourse tends to posi-
tion health as a great value in its temporal sense that makes
health valuable as a thing in itself. Whereas globally accepted
definition of health is extensively generalized,1 health gains
the status of the highest point of human well-being and
self-realization.
Thereby, the concept of health, as problematized in frames
of contemporary cultural discourse, is closely related to the
notion of lifestyle. Notwithstanding the fact that the value of
health can be treated as somewhat significant in any kind of
society, and some researchers even tend to treat health "as
natural, absolute and perpetual life value" (Shapovalova,
2007), considerable discrepancy between the global value of

The Idea of Healthy Lifestyle and Its
Transformation Into Health-Oriented
Lifestyle in Contemporary Society
Olga Pakholok1
Abstract
The major subject matter of the proposed article is the gap between global value of health and its practical implementation
in the form of actual daily practices. The article addresses the concept of health in contemporary society and claims healthy
lifestyle ideology to be the essence of contemporary health culture. Thus, this ideology is discussed as a basic framework
proposed by the modern discourse with respect to body practices management as it builds up its logic of practice. Meanwhile,
health-oriented lifestyle is considered to be a practical logic derived out of it. The author shows that there are four types
of interconnection between the logical practice and the practice of logic, whereas health-oriented lifestyle is one of them.
The article aims to demonstrate that health-oriented lifestyle concept in its visionary ideal form is quite far from being a
practical guide for daily human behavior. Human beings are not ready to fight all their affections although they know much
and sometimes they feel they can do much. This means that the basic ground for an evident discord between the high value
of health and its practical incorporation into daily activities of concrete individuals lies in the field of physicality matters and
civilization's disability to manage them.

health and its practical incorporation into daily activities in
the form of an important lifestyle element can be observed.
The purpose of this article is to analyze the nature of this
inconsistency and to develop a solid explanation for its via-
bility. At that, the logic of our cogitations will be as follows.
First of all, we are going to distinguish between healthy life-
style ideology and health-oriented lifestyle by means of
using the concepts "the logic of practice" and "the practical
logic" of health culture in contemporary society. Then, we
are going to appeal to some empirical evidence to demon-
strate how these concepts reveal themselves in real life. For
healthy lifestyle ideology of contemporary society, we will
address to the latest available European Social Survey (ESS)
data, and for health-oriented lifestyles (or their opposites),
we will turn to WHO Reports. Thus, we intend to show how
ideology is constructed to make people adhere to healthy
lifestyle principles and what is the problem of its transforma-
tion into health-oriented day-to-day activities.
So, the logic of practice is understood as the condition of
operation and the principle of structuring for practical logic,
while practical logic, in its turn, enables the actors to perceive
the logics of practice, to judge, and to act (Schäfer, 2009). As
far as lifestyles are sets of practices and attitudes that make
sense in certain contexts (Chaney, 1996), we are going to dis-
cuss the context of healthy lifestyle and after that, the life-
style itself. With respect to our subject area, the healthy
lifestyle ideology will stand for the logic of practice, whereas
health-oriented lifestyle will represent the practical logic.
Generally, the major distinction between healthy lifestyle
ideology and health-oriented lifestyle is quite transparent--
that is, the distinction between the idea and its practical
embodiment. Nevertheless, it is important to provide more
sophisticated and deep-root explanation for differentiation
between these concepts. Lifestyle points at steady forms of
personal behavior that are the result of free choice making in
frames of field-dictated limits; it is the personal way to solve
social system antagonisms (Beck, 1992). Lifestyle represents
an absolutely modern form of status differentiation, which
implies that status is derived not from the occupation or a
certain set of individual privileges but from the way these
privileges and resources are used individually. Many people,
in particular, choose their occupation and the way of its orga-
nization based on its compatibility with their personal life-
style values (Chaney, 1996). Thus, we can assume that
individual choice is a very important aspect in conceptual
reflection of lifestyle as a notion. Using Ionin's (2000)
expression, "the style can exclusively be present only where
the choice is present" (p. 195). Consequently, the social role,
or the free behavior choice pattern, is the lifestyle's mole-
cule. The style is a typical choice in frames of possible. As
we already made it clear, we are going to analyze the healthy
lifestyle as the logic of practice and a certain ideological
field that offers its consumers a set of principles and direc-
tions toward practical actions with respect to their body and
health. Let us consider it closer.
Healthy Lifestyle Ideology: Politics,
Market, and Branding
First of all, it should be mentioned that healthy lifestyle ide-
ology in its general global meaning is indeed formed under
the dictation of real medical statistics: In contemporary
Figure 1. The risk transition: Over time, major risks to health shift from traditional risks (e.g., inadequate nutrition or unsafe water and
sanitation) to modern risks (e.g., overweight and obesity; World Health Organization, 2009).

world, the main mortality factors are disorders associated
with the way people live their lives. Thus, according to WHO
data, 10 major mortality factors among world population are
(WHO Official Site, n.d.; see Figure 2).2
We can distinctly see that so-called "civilization diseases"
(chronic and degenerative disorders) start to fulfill the top
places among human death factors. These diseases increas-
ingly depend on the lifestyle that one chooses, and on the
quality of one's life as well as on one's ability to use the
available resources of own body strategically and demon-
strate self-reliable orientation toward health during one's
personal lifestyle.
In general, healthy lifestyle criteria are quite simple and
exhaustive: The list of indicators to assess the level of per-
sonal deduction for everyday health care includes dietary
inclinations, physical activity, and unhealthy habits (Knger,
2005). In addition, workplace conditions, public and domes-
tic violence, reproductive behavior, and so on can be taken
into account (Huss-Ashmore et al., 1992). These are the
basic healthy lifestyle principles, which can be found
throughout the whole space of social interactions--from
school and university textbooks (in Valeology, Principles of
personal and social safety, etc.) to political programs.
Healthy Way of Life As a Matter of
Social Politics
The issue of health as a matter of state politics (biopolitics)
can be effectively illustrated by means of Foucault's princi-
ple of state power efficacy, which is based on simultaneous
generalization and individualization. It turns out that, in gen-
eral, health is a personal decision of an individual, and at the
same time, it is the question of national importance. Thus, we
can observe panopticon effect in action, when control over
the members of society is very successfully implemented in
a latent way, and to a large extent they act as controllers. At
the end of the day, the health care system becomes a religion
of modern society. Through the establishment of "uncertain
normality" discourse, only few can be treated as healthy, and
everyone, in fact, becomes a potential patient, which means
entering the field of control, risk assessment, and external
(state) intervention (Kevin, 2007). Some researchers go even
further by stating that public health policy is actually a pro-
gram of social control packaged in a wrapper of healthy life-
style idea promotion. The idea here is in an unprecedented
self-control at the cost of provoking public excitement
increasing resulting as an effective system of individual
behavior regulation (Fitzpatrick, 2001). They even talk about
contemporary death of humane medicine and the rise of
coercive healthism (Fitzpatrick, 2001).
It is important to state that we are not giving here any
assessments of healthy lifestyle ideology as a political issue.
We are rather trying to find its place in frames of political
system. It is obvious that healthy lifestyle ideology does not
exist as an independent database of health state factors and
ways to maintain good health. It rather finds direct expres-
sion in state national legislation promoting everyday health-
focused behaviors among general public. For instance,
Article 32 of the Law of Ukraine "Basic Law of Ukraine on
Health Care" proclaims the following:
Figure 2. The leading causes of death in 2008.
4 SAGE Open
The State shall promote the establishment of healthy way of
living by means of spreading scientific knowledge about health,
medical, environmental and physical education organization,
implementation of activities aimed at improving hygienic
culture, creating the necessary conditions, including medical
monitoring of physical training, recreation and tourism,
development of medical and athletic facilities, dispensaries,
recreation centres and other health facilities to combat health
habits which are harmful for human, establishing a system of
socio-economic incentives for individuals adopting healthy
lifestyle.
Ukraine has made public policy limiting smoking and alcohol
consumption.
Ukrainian legislation, in general, requires from its citi-
zens taking care of their personal health: The Article 11 of
the Law of Ukraine on Health contains the following clause:
"Citizens of Ukraine ought to take care of their health." The
question of real force of this clause is just another one, as it
is clear that no one (at least for now) recovers fines and puts
behind bars for overeating, lack of sleep, or lack of physical
activity. However, in some countries, the attempts to intro-
duce a practice of tax on unhealthy lifestyles already have
been made. Italian Health Ministry wants to introduce a tax
on soft drinks and alcohol (O'Leary, 2012)--several coun-
tries, including Hungary and Denmark, have implemented
nominal "fat taxes" on unhealthy foods; France has an extra
tax on sweetened drinks; Peru plans to implement a junk
food tax in coming months (Koebler, 2012); and Arizona
authorities want to tax smokers and obese people (Forer,
2011). Monique Currie, the deputy director of the state
Medicaid office in Arizona and one of the advocates of this
initiative, said as follows:
If you do not want to change your life and take responsibility for
your health, which ultimately leads to public spending, then you
will have to participate in co-financing. You must take
responsibility for the fact that your smoking costs us a round
sum.
Moreover, WHO, as it is stated in the latest Watch Report
on the 65th World Health Assembly,
should provide technical support and expert advice to member
states on the implementation of fiscal, legislative and regulatory
measures to improve food and nutrition. This should involve
technical support to finance ministries on the administration of
national food tax and regulatory systems and administration, as
well as the production of manuals and toolkits. (WHO Watch
Report on the 65th World Health Assembly, 2012, p.14)
At this point, as we already mentioned, we are going to
refrain from evaluating political programs and social policies
with regard to health behavior promotion at whole. In the
long run, our task here is to show the key role played by the
healthy lifestyle phenomenon in modern sociocultural dis-
course at the level of political organization.
Healthy Way of Life As a Matter of
Market Strategy and Branding
In frames of market economy, we can consider health and
healthy lifestyle as power brands and elements of an excep-
tional new philosophy that is sometimes called "wellness
philosophy." According to expert estimations, the healthy
lifestyle industry, which recently was just at the level of
infancy, promises to be a new billionary industry the next
decade. Today, the wellness market is compared with the
high-tech sector in terms of capital turnover. The world-
wide annual turnover in the industry, according to the anal-
ysis of the famous American businessman and economist
Paul Zane Pilzer, is about 425 billion U.S. dollars. The
researcher notes that in 2000, Wellness industry in America
has already been the one with sales up to 200 billion U.S.
dollars, and about a half of that amount was spent on sports
clubs and 70 billion U.S. dollars on vitamins and minerals
(Pilzer, 2001).
Indeed, today's society market can be the first to react
on public needs for meeting the aspirations to lead a
healthy lifestyle. It makes a huge amount of package offers
that can provide a person with a possibility to buy healthy
(organic) food, visit gyms, health clubs, beauty salons,
spas, and so on. The proportion of people willing to make
substantial investments in their health grows very fast.
According to the German economic research institution
"Global Insight," 47% of people aged from 20 to 30 sug-
gest that they actively use the means to maintain personal
health (Bayram, 2008, p. 28).
Thus, the market eagerly turns the idea of healthy life-
style into the industry of savory versions, a plethora of pub-
lic and commercial broadcasting programs (and books)
designed to make science, technology, or philosophy of
health accessible to the "average man" (Allen & Anderson,
1994, p. 4). That is an easy way to make healthy lifestyle a
fashionable and stylish trend. In modern world, everyone is
in rush for health. The notion of healthy lifestyle has already
gained the archetypical traits. Advertising companies use
this widely to make different products more attractive to
public. Table 1 shows the list of slogans, used in advertise-
ments presented all over the world All of them tend to dra-
matize the health phenomenon.
To that we can also add that even such unhealthily viewed
brands as Coca-Cola are trying to join the ranks of healthy
lifestyle ideology. In the 1980s, Coca-Cola used the advertis-
ing slogan "Have a Coke and a Smile" to boost sales. These
days, it is more like "Have a Coke and Hit the Gym."And the
head honchos at Coke have revamped the brand's advertis-
ing, with a focus on how to incorporate Coca-Cola products
into a healthy lifestyle (Breene, 2013).

Health-Oriented Lifestyle
So, we have shown that healthy lifestyle is an ideology that
is the general logic of practice open for various kinds of prac-
tical embodiment. Now we can go further to the analysis of
the practical logic itself. The interconnection between the
logic of practice and the practical logic is such that the first
serves as the source for knowledge and means necessary for
the second. Hence, we have purposefully split the concepts
of healthy lifestyle and health-oriented lifestyle. Healthy
lifestyle is seen by us as a kind of cliché that can hide or
mask various aspects of health as a sociocultural phenome-
non. Meanwhile health-oriented lifestyle is the practical
implementation of healthy lifestyle idea in a specific bio-
graphical situation.
First of all, when talking about health-oriented lifestyle,
we should mention the aspect of personal choice embedded
into actions that constitute it. This leads us to recognizing it
in frames of intentionality, meaning that health-oriented
action can be broadly defined as the intentional and reflec-
tive activity that has been consciously thought out and aimed
at a specific target (Verlen, 2001). Here, of course, we are
talking about health as such a target. Taking this intentional-
ity aspect into consideration, we may typify health-oriented
lifestyle as a recommended act (as opposed to those allowed
and forbidden; Sorokin, 1992). Indeed, health orientation in
everyday practices is often viewed as a kind of above-normal
activity that is not usually demanded, being although highly
desirable. Such behavior is certainly being endorsed by
different means and, moreover, may be seen as a feat. An
individual showing intentional focus of his or her lifestyle on
health may be perceived as being largely self-limiting,
abstaining from various "unhealthy temptations" and getting
a reward for it in a form of certain positive image in public
eyes. Health-oriented lifestyle choice entails a number of
"awards" on its bearer. Except the health itself, an individual
following healthy lifestyle is seen as a model of organization,
discipline, purposefulness, responsibility, strong will, and
even more. He or she is capable of making an effort, con-
sciously "signing" under the constant hard work on himself
or herself.
Our understanding of the sense hidden under the concept
of health-oriented lifestyle can be widened by means of
involving some ideas initially proposed by Habermas in
frames of his social action theory. Thus, according to him,
there are four types of social action: strategic (utilitarian),
normative (similar to Weber's value-rational action), dra-
matic, and communicative action (Habermas, 1984). If we
analyze the various types of relation to health and corre-
sponding actions determined by it, we can talk about the fol-
lowing. Strategic behavior toward health stands for the
egocentric not too far-sighted actions of individuals aimed at
getting fast results (when people become concerned about
health in terms of short-term profit which is, in fact, a symp-
tomatic treatment not reaching the essentially of the prob-
lem). To some extent, this type of action is purely technical
and temporary, not related to an attempt to implement a com-
prehensive revision of the general life strategy behavior;

when health is really threatened, the person is ready to take
care of it in a disciplined and responsible manner. However,
when health is normal, the need for daily (prophylactic)
reproduction of health depreciates sharply, health resources
start to be confined, yielding in a hierarchy of motives to
other factors such as getting pleasure, building a successful
career, and so on. Normative action reflects noninternalized
attitudes, which means that under other social circumstances,
such as the absence of coercion or other external influence, a
person would not adhere to certain principles of a healthy
lifestyle. A striking example of such kind of activity is the
way of life of many children and teenagers. Until they are
under elder control, they are normally fed, they follow opti-
mal sleep and rest regime, and generally do not resort to bad
habits, but in case of the absence of control they willingly
violate basic principles of a healthy lifestyle. Such kind of
behavior is inherently infantile as it desperately lacks self-
reflection. This means that a person imitates a lifestyle
imposed on him or her by someone else and, accordingly,
would not necessarily adhere to it in other context. Dramatic
action, in this context, expresses human desire of self-
representation, the will to be in the center of the most fashion-
able trends with regard to a healthy lifestyle (fashion for
physical activity, organic food, natural personal hygiene and
household products, etc.). The actual health-oriented lifestyle,
to our opinion, is the one representing communicative activ-
ity that is the one associated with a high level of self-
reflection and long-term prospect; lifestyle-oriented health, in
other words, is a lifelong strategy. Depending on the length of
individual's life perspective in relation to own health, and
also on the type of emotional commitment, all types of actions
can be placed on an integrated axis of coordinate (Figure 3).
The visionary aspect of health-oriented lifestyle can be
brightly illustrated by Piaget theory of cognitive develop-
ment. Health-oriented lifestyle may be regarded to as a kind
of final stage (the highest point) of individual development
representing a well-established striving to a steady state of
dynamic equilibrium. At the "sensorimotor" stage, a person
learns to read the signals of own body, and during this period,
the main type of activity is strategic that is reducing unpleas-
ant (painful) sensations and maximizing of pleasures.
"Preoperative stage" corresponds to normative behavior. At
this stage, a person has to take certain patterns of behavior
for granted not passing them through his or her own con-
scious mind. "Operational stage" turns on self-reflection pro-
cess in a person, but it does not awaken awareness of the
importance of certain actions in the long-term prospect. And
finally, on the "stage of formal operations," a person devel-
ops the rational structure of thinking. It provides an individ-
ual with an opportunity to understand the symbolic value,
use abstract strategies to understand the hidden meanings,
and make general conclusions in the context of the develop-
ment strategy of his or her own life in terms of health.
Thus, we are talking about health-oriented lifestyle as a
daily production of individuals' health. This means that vir-
tually any everyday person's activity is being correlated with
its possible impact on health. That is what may be referred to
as self-sufficient type of health orientation (Bredikhina,
2006), when a person operates with a sufficient knowledge
about health and actively implements the principles of
healthy lifestyle ideology in his or her everyday practices.
Self-sufficiency in health orientation is the grounding foun-
dation of health-oriented lifestyle formation. Its basic prin-
ciple is preventive character of actions related to health. That

is reflected in the idea of a strategic management of health as
a finite resource accompanied with individual orientation
toward long-term outlook and total correlation between all
the aspects of vitality and possible health risks.
Another important dimension of health-oriented lifestyle
is the matter of conscious lifestyle choice. Otherwise, the
whole idea would be a substitute, mere fashion following, a
forced temporary measure, a compromise with oneself on the
basis of self-deception, and so on. Actually, we are talking
about the health-oriented lifestyle choice as "the heroic
pass," provided with a high level of awareness and responsi-
bility, as well as making a constant daily choice while fight-
ing with two basic neurotic obsessions of mankind that are
laziness and fear (Kozlovskij, 2011).
Admittedly, health-oriented lifestyle, generally speaking,
is not a very enjoyable way of existence, which is not sur-
prising, as "any kind of awareness multiplies suffering"
(Kozlovskij, 2011). It is much easier to go with the flow, put-
ting the whole set of responsibility for one's own health on
poor heredity, environmental pollution, and bad health care and
living conditions, promoting the enjoyment motto, "We all are
going to be there sooner or later." Opposed to that, adherence to
health-oriented lifestyle is about self-improvement and self-
commitment; thus, it demands a huge set of efforts. This
involves investment of time as well as socially constructed
forms of attraction with all the conjugated limitations, self-
denial, and self-sacrifice (Bourdieu, 2002).
Doubtlessly, that is what constitutes the ideal (visionary)
practical logic. It is hardly that much commonplace when
we shift our attention to empirical reality. The latest usually
dazzles with a vast range of destructive practices of all
kinds and forms--from poor eating habits to high levels of
alcohol and drugs consumption. The following data (see
Figure 4) show some figures on prevalence of these
unhealthy activities and their consequences worldwide
(WHO Statistics, 2013).
And here is WHO projection on what is going to happen
if people continue to live like they do now (Figure 5).

We can see that the interconnection between the logical
practice and the practice of logic is quite compound. Here,
we were talking about four types of that interconnection,
namely, strategic, normative, dramatic, and communicative
types of health orientations. We also stated that only the lat-
est can be seen as pure health-oriented lifestyle. So here we
are getting close to the question why this visionary highly
valuable and truly beneficial strategy for organizing life
does not become a commonplace reality for majority of
individuals. We believe here that the main reason for that is
rooted deep into cultural codes of Western civilization.
According to Elias (2000), civilizing process is about mov-
ing toward greater suppressing and controlling of the affec-
tive side of human identity. Still, the problem is that
notwithstanding all the civilizational efforts to bring the
physicality under control, the body keeps dictating its own
rules: All kinds of dependences, emotional or physical, mild
and severe, are manifest illustrations for this. Thus, civiliza-
tion progress, being significantly successful in bringing
more instruments for rational control and providing mass
population with the necessary knowledge and means for
control over physicality, has to face that the latter still is too
strong. After all, physicality is much more "experienced" in
comparison with "modern ratio." The thing is that body is a
field for direct implementation of any general healthy life-
style ideological principles.And the problem hidden beneath
that is body's own rules of functioning that often lead a per-
son toward gaining momentary pleasures without assuming
his or her later consequences. Thus, people really have a
high value of health and they usually understand the set of
basic principles of healthy lifestyle but they still WANT to
get pleasure. Although there was no target international
research that could corroborate this thesis, we can demon-
strate the ambivalence between cultural and affective by
means of existent ESS data (Figure 6).
We can see here that those culturally driven values (like
importance to follow traditions and customs, to follow the
rules, to behave properly) do not confront with the value of
freedom and craving for hedonistic values (like importance
to seek fun and pleasure, try different things, and have a good
time).
Thus, even within the social sciences, one should consider
the physicality in the sense that, despite the general civiliza-
tion tends to "curbing affections" (Elias, 2000), the body
continues to dictate its own terms and conditions, often not
even allowing the consciousness to enter the decision-mak-
ing process.
To summarize, we can conclude that healthy lifestyle ide-
ology, which is embodied in politics and economy, is not

that easily transformed into health-oriented lifestyle.
Eventually, we have ascertained that a lifelong adherence to
health-oriented lifestyle is really challenging and hard,
which can be an additional reason why a wide range of
destructive practices are there in the place. However, the
main reason, as we put it, lies in the milieu of civilization's
incapacity to curb physicality and its affections. As long as
civilization largely puts this responsibility on personal
choice and lifestyle decisions, individuals find themselves
stuck between integrated knowledge about health and
healthy lifestyle and their emotional strivings and desires
for obtaining pleasure (which too often, although not neces-
sarily always, tend to be not that healthy). Taking the fact
that short-term gains tend to prevail over long-term benefits
into consideration, the body usually wins. Moreover, we
pointed out that there is a certain underrepresentation of
physicality matters (as determinants of human behavior) in
social sciences and in modern health discourse at large. The
thing is that civilization, despite its general tendency to fight
for human health, simply cannot afford raising individuals
who would be deeply concentrated on filling their bodies
with mindfulness in frames of communicative health-ori-
ented lifestyles. At long last such people would rather be
ascetics than social beings.
