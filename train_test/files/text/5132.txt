On the Real Magnitude of Psychological Sex Differences

Abstract: A comprehensive evolutionary theory of sex differences will benefit from an
accurate assessment of their magnitude across different psychological domains. This article
shows that mainstream research has severely underestimated the magnitude of
psychological sex differences; the reason lies in the common practice of measuring
multidimensional differences one dimension at a time, without integrating them into a
proper multivariate effect size (ES). Employing the Mahalanobis distance D (the
multivariate generalization of Cohen's d) results in more accurate, and predictably larger,
estimates of overall sex differences in multidimensional constructs. Two real-world
examples are presented: (1) In a published dataset on Big Five personality traits, sex
differences on individual scales averaged d = .27, a typical ES conventionally regarded as
"small." However, the overall difference was D = .84 (disattenuated D = .98), implying
considerable statistical separation between male and female distributions. (2) In a recent
meta-analytic summary of sex differences in aggression, the individual ESs averaged d =
.34. However, the overall difference was estimated at D = .75 ­ .80 (disattenuated D = .89 ­
1.01). In many psychological domains, sex differences may be substantially larger than
previously acknowledged.

Introduction
Psychology has a long tradition in the study of sex differences in personality,
cognition and behavior. For more than a century, psychologists have tried to measure them
and to evaluate their impact on social and interpersonal processes. More recently, a large
number of meta-analyses have become available to researchers, thus offering a valuable
yardstick against which to assess the magnitude of psychological sex differences. The
results have been widely variable, but a pattern clearly stands out: Most of the studies find
rather high levels of statistical overlap between the male and female distributions, with
conventionally "large" effects being the exception rather than the rule. This applies to
studies of spatial abilities (overall Cohen's d = .37; Voyer, Voyer, and Bryden, 1995), self-
Sex differences

disclosure (d = .18; Dindia and Allen, 1992), self-esteem (d = .21; Kling, Hyde, Showers,
and Buswell, 1999), personality (d = .10 to .50; Costa, Terracciano and McCrae, 2001),
aggression (overall d = .24; Bettencourt and Miller, 1996), and the list could go on. Hyde
(2005) conducted a second order meta-analysis of sex differences on 128 published meta-
analyses, and found that 78% of all the effect sizes fell below a standardized mean
difference of d = .35, which is conventionally regarded as "small to moderate". In terms of
statistical overlap, d = .35 means that--assuming normality--the male and female
distributions share about 75% of their joint area (Cohen, 1988). Hyde used this result in
support of the "gender similarities hypothesis", i.e., that males and females are similar
rather than different on most psychological variables. While Hyde's analysis has been
criticized for omitting some large-effect studies and for not organizing variables in
biologically relevant categories (Davies and Shackelford, 2006; Lippa, 2006), it is true that
the effects reported in the empirical research often seem to imply little statistical separation
between male and female distributions.
Is this a valid assessment of the data? And most importantly, should we care? I
surmise that, if we want to build a comprehensive evolutionary theory of sex differences,
we need to proceed in two directions at once: On one hand, we should aim to build more
detailed models, develop finer distinctions between functionally distinct subtypes of traits
and behaviors, and identify the specific contexts in which sex differences are magnified or
reduced. On the other hand, we should try to measure the global patterns of sex differences
in different areas of human psychology, and use the quantitative information carried by
effect sizes to better understand the selective processes that have shaped our male and
female minds. In addition, comparing the magnitude of effect sizes across different
psychological domains may provide useful support in the evaluation of competing
explanatory hypotheses on the origin and function of mental and behavioral traits (see
below).
In the present article I will argue that mainstream research has severely
underestimated the magnitude of human sex differences by failing to fully appreciate the
multidimensional nature of many psychological constructs. I will then show how to address
this shortcoming by calculating multivariate indices of effect size (ES). In particular, I will
introduce the multivariate generalization of Cohen's d: the Mahalanobis distance D, a
standardized mean difference calculated simultaneously on k correlated variables. Finally, I
will illustrate the practical import of multivariate ESs with two reanalyses of published
datasets on sex differences in personality and aggression.
The interpretation of effect sizes
With few exceptions, psychological researchers adhere to the convention of
interpreting the magnitude of group differences after a set of guidelines supposedly
recommended by Cohen (1988). As the convention goes, d = .20 represents a "small"
effect, d = .50 is a "moderate" effect, and group differences of d = .80 or more are "large".
Many would be surprised to learn that Cohen (1988) did, in fact, advise against the use of
conventional ES measures; he reluctantly proposed his famous guidelines as a last-resort
approximation to employ when researchers need to perform power analysis, but have no
previous information on the investigated variables (see also Hedges, 2008). Indeed, there is
no justification in statistical theory or methodology for using such conventional labels in
the interpretation of research findings; it is impossible to evaluate the practical magnitude
Sex differences

of an effect size without considering the theoretical relationship between variables, their
measurement error, an the context in which they are measured and analyzed (see e.g.,
Breaugh, 2003; Burchinal, 2008; Hill, Bloom, Black and Lipsey, 2008). In some contexts, a
statistically small deviation from a set value may have important consequences (think of
the rigidly controlled mechanisms that regulate body temperature), while in others even
"large" differences may be inconsequential or comparatively small (e.g., a drug reducing
depressive symptoms by d = .80, when all other drugs on the market reduce them by d = 2
or more).
The practical significance of a difference between means also depends on where
one is looking: differences that have almost undetectable effects in the central region of a
distribution can be amplified by orders of magnitude as one moves toward the distribution
extremes. For example, even if males (on average) were only slightly superior to females in
their visuo-spatial abilities, the male:female ratio would increase dramatically when
considering people with extremely high levels of the same abilities. Whereas such a small
difference might have virtually no consequence in most aspects of everyday life, it could
still determine large sex biases in specialized contexts where high visuo-spatial abilities are
required (e.g., skilled hunting in traditional societies). This distribution-tail effect is often
compounded by the larger variance exhibited by males in many psychological traits,
perhaps especially in those with a history of strong sexual selection (Archer and
Mehdikhani, 2003; see also Halpern et al., 2007). Finally, division-of-labor social and
interpersonal processes may amplify initially small psychological sex differences, ending
up in large differences in the actual behavior of the two sexes (e.g., Becker, 1991).
Effect sizes and the evolutionary psychology of sex differences
Evolutionary theory provides reasons to expect reliable sex differences in
personality, cognition, and behavior (see Buss, 2004; Geary, 1998), and evolutionary
psychological research has often focused on the adaptive value of male-female differences
(e.g., Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Del Giudice, 2009; Schmitt, 2005; Schmitt et al., 2003;
Silverman and Eals, 1992). Although current models are still too coarse to make
quantitative predictions about the absolute magnitude of sex differences, it is already
possible to generate several predictions on their relative magnitude in different traits or
constructs. First of all, the strongest psychological sex differences are expected ­ and found
­ in reproduction-related traits and in those subject to divergent sexual selection pressures
(Buss, 1995, 2004; Davies and Shackelford, 2006); for example, in the literature on mate
preferences ESs are often in the d = .80 ­ 1.50 range (Buss, 1995), higher that those found
in most other psychological domains. Careful application of sexual selection theory
suggests additional, subtler predictions: As discussed by Miller (2000), sex differences in a
sexually selected trait are likely to be small (or even nonexistent) if (1) the trait is subject to
reciprocal mate choice, or (2) both sexes need to possess the same psychological
machinery, in order for members of one sex to evaluate the quality of the trait when it is
expressed by members of the other sex.
Importantly, several psychological constructs that on the surface may appear
unrelated to reproduction turn out to be involved in mating as well. For example, Big Five
personality traits show remarkable evidence of reciprocal sexual selection and assortative
mating (reviewed in Figueredo et al., 2005). At the same time, some of the same traits are
linked to sex-typical mating strategies: Both openness to experience and extraversion
Sex differences

predict increased numbers of sexual partners (Miller and Tal, 2007; Nettle, 2005), and
males might be expected to show higher average levels of these traits in many (but not all)
ecological contexts (see Gangestad, Haselton and Buss, 2006; Gangestad and Simpson,
2000; Schmitt, 2008). Similarly, sex differences in visuo-spatial abilities may have been
indirectly shaped by sexual selection because of the involvement of these abilities in sex-
typical activities that contributed to mating success, such as hunting (Silverman and Eals,
1992). Effect sizes can be used to compare the magnitude of sex differences among
different psychological constructs and, potentially, to adjudicate between alternative
explanations of their evolution (e.g., a model involving reciprocal mate choice versus one
positing divergent sexual selection pressures). Depending on the level of analysis, effect
size comparisons can involve narrow traits such as extraversion or physical aggression, as
well as complex multidimensional constructs such as mate preferences or personality.
Multidimensional effect sizes can also be useful when evaluating the magnitude of
sex differences across different social and ecological contexts. For example, there is
evidence that sex differences in personality traits vary among cultures (Costa et al., 2001);
however, this may or may not translate in a change in the overall statistical overlap between
male and female personality profiles, since different combinations of univariate sex
differences may result in the same overall ES. The study of ecological variation in the
overall patterns of sex similarity/difference has fascinating evolutionary implications; in
this context, multivariate indices can be a valuable addition to standard univariate
measures, and can be employed in cross-cultural studies to explore variation at a level
higher than that of individual variables.
Another potential application of multivariate effect sizes is in the study of the folk
psychology of sex differences. Are people's perceptions of sex differences basically
accurate, or are they prone to distortion by socially transmitted stereotypes? To begin
answering this question, one has to know how large sex differences are in the first place;
and the case can be made that overall, multidimensional sex differences (for example in
personality or aggression) may be a more natural and intuitive metric than differences in
the narrowly specified, individual traits measured by psychologists. It is then possible that
what appear as inflated stereotypes (Hyde, 2005) might actually turn out to be realistic and
accurate representations of the overall statistical distance between male and female profiles.
Such findings would be highly relevant to the evolutionary study of social cognition, folk
psychology, and social learning.
Finally, the rhetorical impact of effect sizes should not be underestimated. The
argument that males and females possess evolved, sexually differentiated psychologies has
been met with especially strong skepticism (e.g., Buller, 2005; Eagly and Wood, 1999);
findings of "small" effect sizes tend to reinforce the skepticism by suggesting that sex
differences are trivial, unimportant, or too small to be of "real" biological significance (see
for example some of the commentaries to Del Giudice, 2009). While this kind of
interpretation is often unwarranted and based on inadequate criteria (see above), the present
reality is that most researchers are likely to be intrigued by a "large" ES much more than by
a "small" one. Showing that the overall sex differences in constructs such as aggression or
personality are substantially larger than previously assumed can alert many researchers to
the fact that sex differences are not an ignorable nuisance of human psychology, but a
robust phenomenon deserving satisfactory theoretical explanation.

The logic of multivariate differences
As stated in the introduction, the standard approach to the evaluation of sex
differences dramatically underestimates their overall magnitude when dealing with
multidimensional psychological constructs. The common procedure employed in meta-
analyses of sex differences goes as follows: (1) sex differences are measured on a set of
variables making up an integrated, multidimensional construct (e.g. the Big Five
personality factors, multiple measures of aggression, or a battery of visuo-spatial tasks); (2)
sex differences on these variables are not combined into a multivariate effect size, but
considered only one at a time; and (3) an average measure of the univariate effect sizes is
taken, and is then treated as an estimate of the overall sex difference in the investigated
construct.
Why is this procedure inadequate? When measuring a multidimensional construct,
the overall difference between two groups is not the average of the effects measured on
each dimension, but a combination of those effects in the multidimensional space: Many
small differences, each of them on a different dimension, can create an impressive effect
when all the dimensions are considered simultaneously. Crucially, such overall differences
are likely to matter more than their individual components, both in shaping people's
perceptions and in affecting social interaction. A geometric example may help at this point
(Figure 1): Consider a cube with edges of length 1, where the three dimensions correspond
to three uncorrelated personality traits (labeled A, B and C), and make vertex M the
position of the male group on the three traits. Now imagine that vertex F represents the
means of females on the same three traits, so that the female mean on each trait is equal to
the male mean plus one. The average sex difference on the three traits is, of course, equal to
one; however, the length of segment MF (i.e., the actual distance between males and
females in this three-dimensional space) is the square root of 3, that is, MF  1.73. Failing
to combine univariate sex differences into a proper multivariate measure leads, in this
simple case with just three dimensions, to underestimate the overall male-female difference
by 42%. In other words, the overall sex difference in this fictional personality space is
almost twice as large as the sex differences observed on each of the three personality
factors. Note that this example assumes orthogonal (uncorrelated) dimensions: If the
dimensions were correlated, then the overall sex difference could become larger or smaller
than the one just calculated, depending on the specific pattern of correlations (see below).

distances.
Note: The cube represents a hypothetical three-factor personality space with orthogonal
factors.
A multivariate effect size: The Mahalanobis distance
The Mahalanobis distance D (Mahalanobis, 1936) is a generalized distance metric
calculated on two or more correlated variables. Like the popular Cohen's d, it is a
standardized distance, i.e., distances are expressed in terms of the standard deviation of the
measured variables. Let there be a set of k variables, and let d be a column vector of length
k whose elements are the between-group differences on each variable; D is given by
d
S
d 1
' -
=
D (1)
where S is the covariance matrix of the k variables. If d is a vector of standardized
differences (i.e., Cohen's d's), then S is the correlation matrix. If the variables are
orthogonal, D reduces to the euclidean distance between groups; if k = 1, D reduces to
Cohen's d. In addition to estimating between-group distances, D can be used to measure the
distance between two cases or between a group and a case; in this last form, it is often
employed to detect outlier cases (see Huberty, 2005 for an introduction; De Maesschalck,
Jouan-Rimbaud and Massart, 2000 for a more technical treatment). The Mahalanobis
distance is closely related to Hotelling's t2, a common multivariate statistic for two-group
comparison.
The interpretation of D is straightforward, as it represents the difference between
two groups in terms of the standard deviation of the multivariate distribution. Thus, the
interpretation of its magnitude is the same as that of Cohen's d; for example, if D = 1, the
two groups are one (multivariate) standard deviation apart. When the k variables are
correlated, the standard deviation can be represented by an ellipsoid; D refers to the
standard deviation in the direction given by the two group centroids. Figure 2 illustrates the
effect of correlations on D in the case of two variables. The main difference between d and
D is that the latter is an unsigned coefficient (always positive), and as such cannot be used
to test directional predictions. To understand the pattern of directional differences between
Sex differences

groups, one has to refer to univariate d values; thus, univariate and multivariate ESs should
be seen as complementary rather than alternative tools.
Figure 2. The effect of correlations on the magnitude of D, illustrated in the bivariate case.
Note: Small circles indicate group means on the two variables (group centroids); the
standard deviations of the bivariate normal distributions are shown as ellipses. Panel A
shows two orthogonal variables: the standard deviation is the same in all directions
(ellipses reduce to circles), and D reduces to the euclidean distance, D = .72 (grey line). In
panels B and C the two variables are correlated (r = +.5 and r = -.5, respectively); whereas
univariate differences between means (d) are the same in the three cases, D becomes larger
in panel B (about one standard deviation) and smaller in panel C. Notice that larger D's
correspond to smaller overlap between distributions, that is, higher statistical separation
between the two groups.
As with Cohen's d, Mahalanobis D can be translated into approximate measures of
statistical overlap by assuming multivariate normality. The overlapping coefficient OVL
represents the proportion of each distribution that is shared with the other distribution, and
is given by
OVL = 2 -D/2
( ) (2)
where  
() is the CDF of the standard normal distribution (Bradley, 2006; Reiser, 2001).
The OVL coefficient can be easily converted to Cohen's index of nonoverlap U1
; whereas
OVL is calculated on a single group, U1
is calculated on the joint distribution of the two
groups:

For consistency with the psychological literature (e.g., Hyde, 2005), in the present
article I will always report (1 - U1
) as an index of overlap. If desired, exact confidence
intervals on D can be computed following Reiser (2001; see also Zou, 2007) or,
alternatively, using bootstrap procedures. An R script for computing D estimates and exact
confidence intervals is available for download at the website:

When applied to k correlated variables making up a multidimensional construct, the
Mahalanobis distance D is almost invariably larger than any of the corresponding
univariate d's, and will thus give a larger effect size (ES) estimate than simply taking an
average value of d. The only exception occurs when the variables are perfectly correlated
(i.e., when the construct is in fact unidimensional).
A simple calculation will help the reader get an intuitive feeling of the expected
increase in effect size when computing the D index instead of relying solely on univariate
d's. Imagine that a researcher was investigating sex differences in aggression, and that
he/she had measured a number of different aggression-related variables. Also imagine that
those variables were completely uncorrelated with one another, and that the standardized
sex difference was exactly the same on all the variables, a conventionally "small" d = .25.
In this case, the size of Mahalanobis D only depends on k, the number of variables
measured by the researcher. Since the variables are orthogonal, D reduces to the euclidean
distance and the overall ES is given by D = .25 k . With two variables, the overall sex
difference would be D = .35. If the variables were three, D would equal .43. For five
uncorrelated variables, D = .56; and if the researcher had measured participants on ten
different aggression variables, each showing a univariate d = .25, the overall ES would be
D = .79. As noted earlier, relatively small differences on many dimensions can add up to a
remarkable overall effect. Finally, adding correlations among variables could make D
larger or smaller (sometimes substantially so), depending on the exact pattern of
correlations (see Figure 2).
In summary, computing multivariate effect sizes will give researchers a more
accurate estimate of the overall difference between males and females on any truly
multidimensional construct. First, the standard procedure almost invariably leads to
underestimate the magnitude of sex differences construct-wise, and such underestimation
bias becomes more severe as the number of measured variables increases. Second, there
simply is no way of properly taking into account the effect of correlations between
variables without calculating a multivariate effect size such as D.
Example 1: Sex differences in personality
I will now turn to a real-world example that strikingly demonstrates the importance
of calculating multivariate effect sizes in addition to univariate ones. In a large Internet-
based survey, Noftle and Shaver (2006) administered a Big Five personality inventory (the
BFI; John, Donahue and Kentle, 1991) to 5,417 female and 2,901 male students.
Standardized sex differences on the five personality scales ranged from d =.10 to d = .53 in
module (Table 1)1, with an average unsigned effect size d = .27. Correcting for attenuation
due to scale unreliability2 brings the average effect size to dc
= .30.

scores in females.
These results are entirely typical of sex differences research and would fit neatly in
Hyde's (2005) meta-analysis; by looking at the average ES, one might conclude that the
male and female distributions of Big Five personality traits in this sample show about 80%
overlap. In fact, multivariate effect sizes tell a rather different story. I reanalyzed the same
data (kindly provided by E. Noftle, personal communication) by calculating the
Mahalanobis distance from Cohen's d values and the correlation matrix of the five BFI
scales (calculations were performed in R 2.7.2; R Development Core Team, 2008)3. As
shown in Table 1, the overall male-female difference on the construct defined by the five
personality scales was D = .84 (with a 95% upper bound of .87)4. Correcting for scale
unreliability raised the estimated ES to Dc
= .98, i.e., a sex difference of about one standard
deviation. The corresponding overlap between the male and female distributions is about
45%; the statistical separation between the sexes in the Big Five personality space is clearly
much larger than could be inferred by looking at individual scales one at a time. Given that

both d values and inter-scale correlations in Noftle and Shaver's study are typical of
personality research, this result is most likely to generalize to the entire field of sex
differences in personality traits.
Example 2: Sex differences in aggression
In a recent article, Archer (in press) discussed the hypothesis that sexual selection is
responsible for the consistent pattern of sex differences observed in same-sex human
aggression. He presented a summary of the meta-analytic findings in aggression research
(Table 2 in Archer, in press) clearly showing that males are higher than females in physical
and verbal aggression, and lower in indirect (or "relational") aggression. The average effect
sizes on the three aggression dimensions, pooled across assessment methods (e.g.,
observation, self report, teacher report), are shown in Table 2 (they were virtually identical
to the median effect sizes and to the combined effect estimates by Knight, Guthrie, Page,
and Fabes, 2002, thus confirming their robustness as overall estimates). The largest sex
differences are found in physical aggression (average d = .58), the smallest in relational
aggression (average d = ­.16). While it is important to discriminate between different
aspects of aggression and to interpret the univariate effect sizes one at a time, it can also
useful to ask how much males and females differ in their overall aggression profiles. The
average univariate effect size module is d = .34; correcting for attenuation by assuming
measurement reliability equal to .80 (a realistic estimate for psychological measures)
produces a slightly higher average of dc
= .38.
In order to compute D, an estimate of the correlations between different types of
aggression is needed. For the purposes of this illustrative example, rough estimates of
typical correlation magnitude can be obtained by surveying the relevant literature.
Correlations between physical and verbal aggression are typically around .40, ranging from
about .35 to .55 (Bernstein and Gesn, 1997; Buss and Perry, 1992; Fossati, Maffei,
Acquarini, and Di Ceglie, 2003; Harris, 1997; Meesters, Muris, Bosma, Schouten, and
Beuving, 1996). Very similar correlations are found between physical and indirect
aggression (from about .20 to .55; Miller, Vaillancourt and Boyle, 2008; Ostrov, Ries,
Stauffacher, Godleski, and Mullins, 2008; Vaillancourt, Brendgen, Boivin, and Tremblay,
2003). A correlation coefficient of .40 was chosen as a reasonable approximation of both
correlations. There are fewer published data on the correlation between verbal and indirect
aggression; however, the overall correlation between direct (physical plus verbal) and
indirect aggression was estimated at .60 in the meta-analysis by Card and colleagues
(2008). I computed D twice, using two different estimates of the verbal-indirect correlation:
the .60 coefficient reported by Card et al. (2008) and a more conservative .40 (i.e., the same
correlation as that between physical and indirect aggression).

Note: Correlations were estimated from the literature as described in the text. Effect sizes
are shown before and after correcting for scale unreliablity, assuming all reliability
coefficients equal to .80. Negative effect sizes indicate higher scores in females.
As shown in Table 2, the estimated overall sex difference in aggression is D = .75 ­
.80. Assuming .80 reliability, the disattenuated estimate is Dc
= .89 ­ 1.01; in other words,
males and females differ about one standard deviation in their overall aggression profiles.
This corresponds to a statistical overlap of about 44 ­ 49%. Despite the error margin due to
the rough estimates of correlations and reliabilities, this illustrative re-analysis indicates
that the overall size of sex differences in human aggression may be more than twice as
large as the average of the univariate ESs.
Limitations
The above examples show that proper aggregation of effect sizes can reveal
substantial sex differences in multivariate psychological constructs. Of course, this does not
mean that aggregation will always be useful or meaningful. I want to underline once again
that I'm not proposing to automatically substitute univariate ESs with their multivariate
counterparts; rather, the latter offer a complementary source of information, one that can be
more or less interesting depending on the research question at hand. Most evolutionary
hypotheses are highly domain-specific, and may be best answered by comparisons on
single variables. In some instances, differences between males and females may be
qualitative rather than quantitative, with distinct processes at work in the two sexes; clearly,
in such cases any simple calculation of effect sizes (univariate or multivariate) would be
uninformative or even misleading.
Methodological remarks
Before concluding, I will briefly discuss some additional methodological aspects of
using D as a summary effect size. First of all, the reader may be wondering about the
relationship between the number of measured variables and the magnitude of D. If D tends
to increase with the number of variables making up the construct of interest, won't
Sex differences

aggregating large number of variables produce inflated estimates of sex differences? To
answer this question, one has to remember that D depends on the pattern of correlations
between variables in addition to their number. Imagine that researcher A measures
personality using only 5 scales, whereas researcher B employs 30 different scales. The 30
scales of researcher B are likely to show more content overlap with one another, and larger
between-scale correlations; if the many scales he/she uses are psychometrically redundant,
this will lead to relatively smaller estimates of D. In other words, adding variables
contributes to D only as long as they provide new information about sex differences.
Conversely, if the "true" dimensionality of that personality space is closer to 30 than to 5,
and/or if some of the 30 scales reveal interesting sex effects that are masked in the 5 scales
of researcher A, then researcher B may correctly get a higher estimate of the overall sex
difference. The issue of how many variables to aggregate is, at bottom, a theoretical one:
Careful definition of the traits under investigation is essential to ensure that the chosen
variables provide a satisfactory coverage of the intended construct.
That said, it is true that sampling error will tend to inflate estimates of D when large
numbers of variables are aggregated together. Even if all the univariate sex differences in
the population were equal to zero, it would be virtually impossible that all the sample d's
turned out exactly zero as well. The same phenomenon leads to inflated R2 estimates when
adding large numbers of independent variables to a multiple regression model. For this
reason, when computing multivariate effect sizes researchers should (1) avoid including
unnecessary or clearly redundant variables, and/or reduce the dimensionality of the
construct via factor analysis; (2) in particular, keep the number of variables small when
sample size is not large; and (3) when possible, compute confidence intervals on D to check
the reliability of the estimate.
Finally, a note on correlation matrices: sometimes sex differences in two or more
variables create spurious correlations between those variables that can muddle up the
interpretation of D. For example, imagine that females were both more nurturing and less
dominant than males, but that nurturance and dominance were otherwise completely
unrelated within each sex. When computing whole-sample statistics, dominance and
nurturance would be negatively correlated, but that would be solely due to sex differences
in the two variables. Using the overall correlation coefficient to compute D would count the
effect of sex differences twice, thus biasing the result in potentially misleading ways. For
this reason, it seems advisable not to use whole-sample correlation matrices when
computing Mahalanobis D to measure sex differences; whenever possible, a better estimate
of correlations (unbiased by between-group differences) can be obtained by computing
separate correlation matrices for males and females, then pooling them with one of the
available methods. Of course, computing a pooled estimate is only meaningful if the
within-sex correlation matrices are reasonably similar to one another.
Conclusion
Current research practices lead to inadequate assessment of the overall
psychological differences between males and females; relatively small univariate
differences are taken at face value, without properly aggregating them into multivariate ES
indices. When differences are measured on multidimensional constructs, multivariate
indices will almost invariably produce larger estimates of the statistical distance between
Sex differences

the sexes. Luckily, the appropriate multivariate ES indices are readily available, although
seldom presented in data analysis textbooks; the Mahalanobis distance D is a highly
intuitive measure of multivariate differences between groups, and has the same basic
interpretation of Cohen's d.
In this article I argued that accurate assessment of the magnitude of sex differences
can foster progress in evolutionary research; indeed, I believe that evolutionary
psychologists are especially likely to benefit from better measurement in this area. While
the available models are still rudimentary in some respects, they already make it possible to
predict the relative weight of sex differences between different psychological domains; and
as theory will grow more sophisticated, empirical tests will increasingly depend on accurate
quantification of between-sex variation, thus making effect size computation ever more
important. I hope the present article will contribute to bring this important topic to the
attention of researchers interested in human sex differences; I also hope it will prompt
psychologists (regardless of their theoretical background) to challenge the received wisdom
and consider the possibility that, taken as groups, human males and females are more
different from one another than we currently believe.
