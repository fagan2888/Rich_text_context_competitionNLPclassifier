Among Young Adolescents in Low-Income
Central City Neighborhoods

Objective: To examine the association between pat-
terns of out-of-school care over time and the initiation
of sex among young adolescents living in low-income ur-
ban families.
Design: A prospective cohort study (using a 16-month
follow-up) examining the predictive value of changes in
out-of-school-care arrangements on early sex initiation.
Setting and Participants: By using a multistage strati-
fied area probability sampling strategy, we selected 494
subjects aged 11 to 13 years living in low-income cen-
tral city neighborhoods who did not report having had
sexual intercourse by time 1.
Main Outcome Measure: Adolescent report of hav-
ing had sexual intercourse by time 2.
Results: Bivariateresultssuggestedthatbeingathomewith
an adult during out-of-school hours was related to less sex
initiation than self-care, care at another person's home, and
attendance at an organized/supervised activity. Adjusting
for demographic attributes, parental monitoring, parental
curfews,andfamilyroutines,remaininginout-of-homecare
or self-care was associated with a 2.5 times (95% confi-
dence interval, 1.3-5.1 times) increase in the likelihood of
initiating sexual intercourse when compared with being at
home with an adult at both assessment times.
Conclusion: Policies and programs that enable young
adolescents to spend their out-of-school hours at home
with an adult may help reduce the risk of early sex ini-
tiation among youth in low-income urban areas.

ALTHOUGH THE PROPOR-
tion of adolescents initiat-
ing sex before they are in
ninth grade declined from
40% in 1991 to 34% in
2001,1 there are compelling public health
reasons to continue to focus on early sex
initiation among adolescents. Adoles-
cents who engage in sexual intercourse at
an early age experience increased risks of
having multiple sexual partners2,3 and us-
ing contraception irregularly4 and, in turn,
face heightened risks of experiencing un-
planned pregnancies and acquiring sexu-
ally transmitted infections.5
Much of the research exploring social
contextual influences on early sex among
adolescents has focused on risks related
to parenting practices and neighborhood
conditions.6,7 Virtually none of this con-
textual research has considered how care
arrangements during out-of-school hours
(ie, after school and during the summer)
affect the probability that a young person
has sex at an early age. This is despite the
fact that many adolescents spend after-
school and summer hours away from par-
ents.8 Where and with whom adolescents
spend their out-of-school hours provide
important information about the nature of
youths' out-of-school social contexts. Out-
of-school care is conceptually distinct from
parenting practices such as monitoring and
involvement, which represent explicit pa-
rental efforts aimed at influencing adoles-
cent behavior.
Knowledge about how out-of-school
care affects adolescent problem behav-
iors such as substance use, delinquency,
and deviant peer involvement may in-
form our understanding of out-of-school
care's impact on early sex initiation be-
cause early sex often co-occurs with these
other adolescent health-compromising be-

haviors.9 In this regard, some research has shown that
substance use is significantly higher among students in
self-care (ie, "latchkey children") than among youth not
in self-care, and that the extent of problem behaviors in-
creases with the number of hours spent in self-care.10
Other studies, however, have shown that adolescents in
self-care do not differ in terms of behavior problems, self-
esteem, social adjustment, and susceptibility to peer pres-
sure when compared with adolescents being cared for by
an adult. Rather, these studies have shown that negative
health outcomes increase as out-of-school-care arrange-
ments become further removed from adult supervision,
such as moving from being at a neighbor's house, to being
at school, to being at a job, and, especially, to "hanging
out" with friends.11-13 There is some evidence that high
levels of parental supervision and involvement mitigate
risks associated with self-care.11,14 These studies did not
focus on low-income families and did not consider the
extent to which parenting practices mediated associa-
tions between out-of-school-care arrangements and ado-
lescent behavior.
In the present study, we examine the relationship be-
tween patterns of out-of-school care over time and the
early initiation of sex among low-income, primarily ra-
cial or ethnic minority, adolescents living in poor, ur-
ban neighborhoods. There are several reasons to focus
on this population. First, when compared with their so-
cioeconomically advantaged counterparts, these youth
are more likely to initiate sex at an early age.15-17 Sec-
ond, because work mandates included in the Personal Re-
sponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act
of 1996 have resulted in more poor mothers moving into
the workplace,18 issues of out-of-school supervision and
care have becoming increasingly relevant to poor fami-
lies.19 Third,familiesinlow-incomeurbanareasfaceunique
challenges in caring for their adolescent youth during out-
of-school hours. For example, neighborhood violence and
other threats to safety have a heightened salience to fami-
lies in low-income, urban areas such that self-care may be
a less desirable arrangement for these families. The fact
that self-care is less prevalent among families in central
city areas and among African American compared with
white youth20 supports this possibility. Given that fami-
lies with limited financial resources face constraints in ac-
cessing high-quality after-school and summer programs,
they face limited options regarding after-school and sum-
mer care for their youth. Possibly because of racial or eth-
nic minority families' greater economic needs and lack of
formal labor market opportunities, African American and
Latin American families are more likely than white fami-
lies to rely on extended kin to care for their adolescents.21
The research question addressed in this study is: "What
is the association between patterns of out-of-school care
over time and sex initiation among young adolescents liv-
ing in low-income, urban neighborhoods?" When com-
pared with youth who either remain in self-care over time
or move into self-care at time 2, we expect that adoles-
cents in adult-supervised forms of care will have a lower
odds of initiating sex. Furthermore, it is expected that
positive parenting practices will mediate some of the as-
sociation between adult-supervised care and reduced sex
initiation.
METHODS
SAMPLE
The data for this study derive from a household-based, stratified-
random, longitudinal survey22 of more than 2400 low-income
families living in low-income neighborhoods in 3 locations (Bos-
ton, Mass; Chicago, Ill; and San Antonio, Tex). Participants were
interviewed in 1999 and again an average of 16 months later.
Data were collected on demographics, family health and well-
being, and parenting. A detailed description of the study's de-
sign and methods is available elsewhere.23 Informed consent
was obtained from caregivers and youth before each inter-
view. The institutional review boards of The Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, Baltimore; Northwestern University, Chicago; Har-
vard University, Boston; The University of Texas at San Antonio;
Penn State University, University Park, Pa; Boston College, Bos-
ton; and Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,
NC, approved all procedures.
Because of our interest in sex initiation among young ado-
lescents (for whom the health risks associated with sexual in-
tercourse are greatest4-6), we selected a sample of female care-
givers and their adolescents who were aged 11 to 13 years at
time 1. We refer to female caregivers as mothers in this study
because 90% of them were the biological or adoptive mother
of the adolescent. Of these 694 youth, we excluded youth who
did not participate at time 2 (74 [10.7%]), had already initi-
ated sex by the first time assessment (46 [6.6%]), and had miss-
ing or invalid data for study variables (96 [13.8%] of those who
had participated in both waves). This resulted in a sample of
494 subjects aged 11 to 13 years (71.2% of the original sample
of adolescents in this age group).

As shown in Table 1, most adolescents were African Ameri-
can or Latino. Almost two thirds of the youth lived with a mother
only, and in more than a third of families, neither the parent
nor spouse had finished high school or received a general equiva-
lency diploma. Just over half of mothers in the sample did not
have a paying job; 25.7% worked full time.
Adolescents excluded from the sample because they al-
ready had had sex at time 1 were more likely to be male (P.05)
and reported lower levels of parental monitoring (P.001) and
parental curfews (P.05) than did youth who had not had sex
by time 1.
MEASURES
Dependent Variable
Adolescent sexual intercourse was measured by the question:
"Have you ever had sexual intercourse?" (Response categories
were as follows: 0, no; and 1, yes.) The question was preceded
by a statement that sexual intercourse is sometimes called "hav-
ing sex," "making love," or "going all the way." Because ado-
lescents were aged 11 to 13 years at the time of enrollment into
the study, we regard the initiation of sexual intercourse by the
time 2 interview (an average of 16 months after the time 1 in-
terview) as early sex initiation.
Independent Variables
Out-of-school care was measured using the mother's time 1 and
time 2 answers to the question: "Aside from school, where would
you say [child] spent most of [his/her] time when [he/she] was
not with you last week?" Original response categories in-
cluded the following: 1, "child always with respondent"; 2, "in
respondent's home with father or respondent's partner"; 3, "in
respondent's home with sibling(s)"; 4, "in respondent's home
with a relative"; 5, "in respondent's home with a nonrelative";
6, "formal day care center"; 7, "organized/supervised activi-
ties (eg, sports or an after-school program)"; 8, "outside of home
with a relative"; 9, "outside the home with nonrelative"; 10,
"home, playing outside"; 11, "home alone"; and 12, "other
(specify)." Because there were few youth in some of these care
arrangements, we categorized responses into the following
groups at times 1 and 2: 0, "at home in maternal care"; 1, "at
home with father or mother's male partner or another adult";
2, "in an organized/supervised activity"; 3, "outside the home
in the care of a relative or nonrelative"; and 4, "self-care" (in-
cludes home without an adult and playing outside). Adoles-
cents in the other category (n=7) were not included in the
sample. (At time 1, we were only able to verify if the sibling at
home with the youth was an adult because a subsequent sur-
vey item asked about the age of the sibling but not of the old-
est person with the child at home. Our categorization of re-
sponses at time 1 may, therefore, have some measurement error
because we assume that the nonsibling or nonrelative at home
is an adult.)
Measures of parenting included parental monitoring, pa-
rental curfews, and family routines. Parental monitoring was
a 5-item measure indicating adolescent reports of the moth-
er's knowledge of who the child's friends are, where the child
is after school and at night, what the child does during free time,
and how the child spends money. Response categories were as
follows: 1, "doesn't know"; 2, "knows a little"; and 3, "knows
a lot." Parental curfews was a 2-item measure indicating ado-
lescent reports of the latest time that the mother allows the youth
to stay out on school and weekend nights. Original response
categories were as follows: 1, "as late as I want"; 2, "before 8:00";
3, "8:00 to 8:59"; 4, "9:00 to 9:59"; 5, "10:00 to 10:59"; 6, "11:00
or later"; and 7, "I am not allowed out Sunday through Thurs-
day [Friday or Saturday] nights." These data were recoded so
that higher values indicated stricter or earlier curfews. Family
routines was a 5-item measure indicating the mother's reports
of the extent to which the family had daily routines for talking
or playing quietly, for eating meals, and for children doing home-
work and going to bed. Response categories were as follows:
1, "almost never"; 2, "sometimes"; 3, "usually"; and 4, "al-
ways." Scales demonstrated adequate reliability (=.69 for cur-
fews, =.71 for parental monitoring, and =.68 for family rou-
tines). Mean (SD) scores were 0.65 (0.19) for parental curfews,
0.89 (0.12) for parental monitoring, and 2.76 (0.67) for fam-
ily routines.
Because previous research indicates an increased risk of early
sex initiation among male youth,24 older youth, African Ameri-
can and Latin American (vs white) youth,1 and youth from lower
socioeconomic status backgrounds,15 we included variables to
indicate the adolescent's sex (0 indicates male; and 1, female),
age, race/ethnicity (0 indicates African American; 1, Latino; and
2, white), and parent education (0 indicates less than high school;
1, high school degree or general equivalency diploma; and 2,
more than high school). Although early initiation of sex is as-
sociated with living in a "nonintact" family structure,25 many
racial and ethnic minority youth live in extended kin house-
holds that potentially provide the same level of supervision found
in 2-parent families. Thus, we created the following family struc-
ture categories: 0, 2 biological or adoptive parents; 1, mother
plus stepfather or male partner; 2, mother plus extended kin;
3, mother only; and 4, no biological or adoptive mother. We
also included a measure of maternal work hours (0, not work-
ing; 1, work 40 hours; and 2, work 40 hours) and of the
city in which the interview took place (dummy coded with Bos-
ton as the reference group).
DATA ANALYSIS
We ran cross tabulations with 2 tests of significance and com-
parisons of means with 1-way analysis of variance to examine
bivariate associations between early sex initiation and the fol-
lowing variables: times 1 and 2 measures of out-of-school care;
and time 1 measures of adolescent age, adolescent sex, adoles-
cent race or ethnicity, parental monitoring, parental curfews,
family routines, family structure, parent education, maternal
work hours, and city of interview. We used findings from bi-
variate analyses of sex initiation by out-of-school-care arrange-
ments at both assessment times to develop a variable that de-
scribes patterns of out-of-school care over time. We next ran a
logistic regression model in which sex initiation by time 2 was
regressed on patterns of out-of-school care over time, all time
1 parenting measures (because of their conceptual relevance
to our model), and time 1 adolescent and family demographic
variables that were statistically significant at P.05 in bivari-
ate analyses. Analyses were conducted using a commercially
available software program (SPSS, version 11.0).26
RESULTS
As shown in Table 2, 16.4% (n=81) of the adolescents
in this study initiated sex by time 2. Significantly more ado-
lescents initiated sex if, at the time 2 assessment, they were
in an organized/supervised activity, outside the home with
a relative or nonrelative, or in self-care, compared with
being at home in maternal care or at home with the father
or mother's male partner or another adult. Although the
overall 2 value did not reach statistical significance for
the time 1 assessment of out-of-school care, the pattern

of association with early sex initiation was similar to that
shown at time 2. When compared with those who did not
initiate sex at time 2, adolescents who did initiate sex were
older and more likely to be male.
Based on findings for bivariate associations between sex
initiation and out-of-school-care arrangements at each as-
sessment time, we developed a measure indicating 4 pat-
terns of change in out-of-school care from time 1 to time
2.Thesepatternswerecodedasfollows:0,remainedinadult
care at home; 1, moved from self-care or out-of-home care
into adult care at home; 2, moved from at-home adult care
to self-care or out-of-home care; and 3, remained in self-
care or out-of-home care at both times. Results from mul-
tivariate analyses (Table 3) show that adolescents who
remained in out-of-home care or self-care at both assess-
ment times were more likely to initiate sex than were ado-
lescentsremainingathomewithanadult.Theseeffectsheld
when accounting for the adolescent's sex and age and lev-
elsofparentalmonitoring,parentalcurfews,andfamilyrou-
tines. Consistent with bivariate results, the likelihood of
sex initiation was greater among older compared with
younger adolescents and was lower among females. There
were no statistically significant associations between sex
initiation and parenting variables or family structure.

parenting and, more recently, of neighborhoods. This
study's results suggest that out-of-school care repre-
sents an additional social context salient to the risk of
early sexual intercourse among young adolescents liv-
ing in low-income urban areas. Contrary to our expec-
tation that latchkey adolescents would be at greater risk
for early sex initiation than adolescents in any form of
adult-supervised care, results from our bivariate analy-
ses suggested that early sex initiation was similarly
higher among adolescents in out-of-home care and self-
care. Findings from prospective analyses indicated that
young adolescents who spent their out-of-school hours
either in self-care or outside their own home, such as at
a friend's house, in an organized activity, or at the home
of a relative, at each assessment time were 2.5 times
more likely to initiate sex than those who remained at
home with an adult. We did not find support for the
idea that positive parenting practices helped account for
the relationship between at-home adult care and
reduced sex initiation.
In interpreting findings for out-of-school care, it is use-
ful to consider that families in this study were all low in-
come and lived in either poor or near-poor central city
neighborhoods of Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio.
Based on previous research, adolescents in this study likely
faced considerable neighborhood dangers and risks, such
as violence, drug use, early childbearing, and jobless-
ness.27 In this way, being at home with an adult may have
reduced a youth's opportunities for engaging in early sex
by reducing their exposure to risky social contexts ex-
ternal to the family. These structural barriers seemed to
represent a more effective means of deterring early sexual
intercourse than did explicit parental efforts aimed at
changing the adolescent's behavior. Parents' knowledge
of the youth's whereabouts and activities, having rules
about curfews, and maintaining familial routines showed
no statistically significant relationships with early sex ini-
tiation.
Our study does not account for the possibility that ado-
lescents manifesting more problem behavior (often cor-
related with early sex initiation) elicit negative feelings
and reactions by their families such that they are less likely
to be cared for at home by an adult when compared with
youth exhibiting fewer problem behaviors. In this way,
being cared for outside of the home might represent a
consequence rather than a predictor of early sex initia-
tion. We were also unable to account for possible changes
in the specific nature of out-of-school care occurring dur-
ing the 16-month period between assessment times. De-
spite limitations regarding measures of out-of-school care
and adolescent sex initiation over time, issues of reverse
causality (ie, mothers altering out-of-school care in re-
sponse to the youth initiating sex after time 1) do not
affect the validity of our findings regarding out-of-
school patterns and sex initiation. This is because changes
in out-of-school care were unrelated to the likelihood of
sex initiation. Only when youth remained in self-care or
out-of-home care did they experience an increased like-
lihood of sex initiation compared with those remaining
in at-home adult care. It is unclear whether findings from
this study would generalize to more economically ad-
vantaged families or to families living in suburban and
rural areas.
As welfare reform legislation continues to mandate that
poor mothers join the labor force, future research should
consider factors affecting low-income families' deci-
sions regarding out-of-school care for adolescents and,
in turn, the health of adolescents. It may be useful, for
example, to understand how low-income mothers' de-
cisions regarding out-of-school care are influenced by the
availability of kin and adult support networks, by per-
ceived neighborhood conditions, and by the structure and
nature of the job market. In this way, it may be possible
to develop policies and programs that can support low-
income families' efforts in raising their adolescent youth
and, in turn, potentially help reduce rates of early sexual
intercourse.
