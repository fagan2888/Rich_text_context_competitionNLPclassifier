Abstract
Objective: To examine the role of microRNA (miR)-205 in proliferation, migration and invasion of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
Methods: The human NPC cell line CNE2 was transfected with miR-205 mimic, anti-miR-205
inhibitor or scrambled oligonucleotide (control). Cell proliferation was assessed via MTT assay.
Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by transwell migration and MatrigelÕ invasion assay,
respectively. Radiation induced apoptosis was quantified via Caspase-Glo3/7 assay. Apoptotic
proteins and epithelial­mesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins were semiquantified by Western
blot analysis.
Results: Overexpression of miR-205 increased the proliferation, migration and invasion of CNE2
cells, and decreased radiation-induced apoptosis compared with control cells. MiR-205 over-
expression downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated Snail expression via downregulation of
PTEN and upregulation of AKT.
Conclusion: MiR-205 plays vital roles in tumourigenesis and tumour progression in NPC, and may
be a potential treatment target.

Introduction
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the
most common primary malignancy of the
nasopharynx, with a yearly incidence of 25
cases per 100 000 and a high prevalence in
southeast Asia and southern China.1

NPC has three subtypes based on degree of
differentiation: keratinizing squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) (type 1); nonkeratinizing
carcinoma (type 2); undifferentiated carcin-
oma (type 3).2 Types 2 and 3 NPC are
strongly associated with Epstein­Barr virus
(EBV).3 In patients with advanced type 3
NPC, the 5-year survival rate is <50%.4
Radiotherapy is the primary treatment for
patients with NPC,5 but radioresistance and
local recurrence are major limitations to its
value. It is therefore important to investigate
the molecular mechanisms and identify pre-
dictive markers in NPC.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-
coding RNA molecules that post-transcrip-
tionally regulate gene expression by binding
to the 30-UTR of their target mRNAs.6
MiRNAs regulate many biological func-
tions including tumour development, differ-
entiation, proliferation and apoptosis.7
Expression profiling has shown that
miRNA expression is different in NPC
tissue compared with normal nasopharyn-
geal tissue, and aberrant miRNAs are
correlated with clinical stage.8 In addition,
some studies have demonstrated that EBV-
encoded miRNAs play a critical role in the
regulation of EBV infection and latency.9
Growing evidence suggests that miRNAs
affect NPC carcinogenesis and metastasis by
activating various signalling pathways.10
For example, several miRNAs activate c-
Myc, which then regulates tumour cell
growth and carcinogenesis;11 in addition,
MiR-200a regulation of ZEB2 and b-catenin
promotes NPC cell migration and
invasion.12
The aim of the present study was to
examine the roles of miR-205 in the prolif-
eration, migration and invasion of NPC.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
The human NPC cell line CNE2 was
obtained from the Cancer Centre of
Hangzhou First People's Hospital,
Hangzhou, China. Cells were grown in RPM
I1640 medium (InvitrogenTM, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inacti-
vated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100IU/ml
penicillin and 100mg/ml streptomycin. Cells
were cultured at 37C in a humidified incuba-
tor in 5% carbon dioxide/95% air.
Transfection
MiR-205 mimic and anti-miR-205 inhibitor
were purchased from GenePharma
(Shanghai, China). When CNE2 cells reached
70% confluence, they were transfected
with miR-205 mimic or anti-miR-205 inhibi-
tor using LipofectamineÕ 2000 (Invitrogen,
USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Scrambled oligonucleotide
was used as negative control for the
transfection.
MiRNA quantification
At 48 h after transfection, total RNA was
extracted from 106 cells using a mirVanaÕ
miRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions, and cDNA was synthesized
using a TaqManÕ MicroRNA Reverse
Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative real-
time polymerase chain reaction (qRT­
PCR) was performed using the TaqManÕ
Universal PCR Master Mix. The cycling
programme involved preliminary denatur-
ation at 95C for 5 min, followed by 35
cycles of denaturation at 95C for 30s,
annealing at 65C for 30 s, and elongation
at 70C for 60s, followed by a final elong-
ation step at 95C for 5 min. Primer
sequences were: GAPDH, sense 50-GTCT
CCTCTGACTTCAACAGCG-30, and anti-
sense 50- ACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCC
AA-30 (GAPDH); and miR-205, sense
primer 50-TTTTCAGACTCC-3' and anti-
sense primer 50-CTCTTGTCCTTCATT

CCACC-30. MiR-205 was quantified by
reference to GAPDH levels.
Cell proliferation
At 48 h after transfection, cell proliferation
was assessed using the MTT (3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazo-
lium bromide) assay, as described.13 Briefly,
100 ml of transfected CNE2 cell suspension
was inoculated to each well of a 96-well plate
at 3 Â 104 cells/well. On alternate days, MTT
solution (20 ml, 5 mg/ml) was added to each
well, and the plates were incubated in the
dark for 4 h at 37C, followed by removal of
the culture medium and addition of 100 l
dimethyl sulphoxide. Absorbance was mea-
sured at 492 nm, with 655 nm as the refer-
ence wavelength. Each group used six
parallel wells and all experiments were
carried out in triplicate.
Irradiation
At 48h after transfection, cells were seeded in
24-well plates at density of 1Â 105/well. After
incubation for 24h, cells were irradiated with
0, 2, 5 or 10Gy. CNE2 cells were cultured for
a further 36h before apoptosis was quantified
using a Caspase-Glo3/7 assay kit (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions. Luminescence was
measured with a luminometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using
a 1min lag time and 0.5s/well read-time.
Experiments were performed in triplicate.
Cell invasion assay
Cell invasion was quantified by MatrigelÕ
invasion assay. At 48 h after transfection,
CNE2 cells (transfected with either miR-205
mimic or anti-miR-205 inhibitor) were
placed in the upper chamber of a BD
BiocoatÕ MatrigelÕ Invasion Chamber
(BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) in
0.5 ml DMEM with 0.1% bovine serum
albumin. RPMI1640 containing 5% FBS
was added to the lower chamber. Cells were
incubated for 24 h then noninvading cells
were removed with a cotton swab. Invasive
cells were stained by Diff-QuikÕ
(ThermoFisher Scientific) stain and counted
via light microscopy. The percentage of
invasion was expressed as the ratio of
invading cells over the cell number, normal-
ized on day 2 of the growth curve.
Western blotting
At 48 h after transfection, 106 transfected
CNE2 cells were lysed with RIPA buffer
(Beyotime, Jiangsu, China) then boiled for
5 min. Protein samples were separated by
sodium dodecyl sulphate­polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred to poly-
vinylidene difluoride membranes. After
blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in
1 Â Tris buffered saline/0.1% Tween-20
(pH 7.4; TBST) at room temperature for
1 h, membranes were incubated overnight at
4C with rabbit antihuman antibodies to E-
cadherin, Snail, caspase 9, Bcl-2, Bax, AKT
and PTEN (all 1:500 dilution; Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), washed
three times with TBST for 10 min at room
temperature, then incubated with horserad-
ish peroxidase-conjugated mouse antirabbit
secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution; Cell
Signaling Technology, USA) for 1 h at room
temperature. Membranes were washed three
times with TBST for 10 min at room tem-
perature and immunoreactive signals were
visualized using an EasySeeÕ Western Blot
Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China).
Protein bands were quantified by densitom-
etry (Tanon-1600 gel image system;
BioTanon, Shanghai, China).
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SD.
Between-group comparisons were made
using Student's t-test. Statistical analyses
Mao et al. 233
were performed using SPSSÕ version 11.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for

statistically significant.
Results
Transfection of CNE2 cells with miR-205
mimic resulted in significantly higher miR-
205 expression (P ¼ 0.0002, Figure 1a)
and rate of cell proliferation at 7 days after
transfection (P ¼ 0.0081; Figure 1b)
compared with cells transfected with control
oligonucleotide. In addition, CNE2 cells
transfected with miR-205 exhibited
significantly lower levels of apoptosis after
irradiation than control cells (2Gy irradi-
ation, P ¼ 0.0387; 5 Gy, P ¼ 0.0129; 10Gy,
P ¼ 0.0102; Figure 1c). As shown in Figures
1d and 1e, the radiation-induced (2Gy)
increase in BAX and caspase-9 protein levels
was reversed by miR-205 overexpression. In
addition, levels of Bcl-2 protein were visibly
increased in cells transfected with miR-205
compared with control cells.
Migration and invasion were significantly
enhanced in CNE2 cells transfected with
miR-205 mimic compared with control
cells (migration, P ¼ 0.0079; invasion,
P ¼ 0.0090; Figures 2a­d). In contrast,
transfection with anti-miR-205 inhibitor
significantly inhibited migration and inva-
sion compared with control cells (migration,
P ¼ 0.0055; invasion, P ¼ 0.0031; Figures
2e­h).
Western blot analysis of epithelial­mes-
enchymal transition (EMT) proteins is
shown in Figure 3. E-cadherin levels were
visibly decreased and N-cadherin and Snail
levels were visibly increased in CNE2 cells
transfected with miR-205 mimic, compared
with control cells (Figures 3a and 3c)
(P < 0.05). In contrast, levels of E-cadherin
were increased, and N-cadherin and Snail
were decreased, in CNE2 cells transfected
with anti miR-205 inhibitor, compared with
control cells (Figures 3b and 3d) (P < 0.05).
Western blot analysis of the signalling
proteins AKT and PTEN is shown in Figure
4. Transfection with miR-205 mimic resulted
in increased AKT and decreased PTEN
levels compared with control cells (Figures
4a) and 4c) (P < 0.05). In contrast, transfec-
tion with anti miR-205 inhibitor resulted in
decreased AKT and increased PTEN levels
compared with control cells (Figures 4b and
d) (P < 0.05).
Discussion
Studies have shown that miR-205 can act as
either a tumour suppressor or an oncogene
depending on the tumour type.14­16
Overexpression of miR-205 increased pro-
liferation and inhibited radiation-induced
apoptosis of CNE2 cells in the present
study. Consistent with our findings, others
have shown that miR-205 promotes growth,
metastasis and chemoresistance in nonsmall
cell lung cancer17 and is upregulated in
NPC.18 There is evidence to suggest that
miR-205 induces radioresistance in NPC
cells via activation of PTEN.19,20 Taken
together, these data suggest that miR-205
plays a critical role in NPC development and
treatment.
Aggressive tumours are characterized by
local invasion and distant metastasis. These
processes include cell proliferation, changes
in cell morphology and destruction of the
extracellular matrix.21­23 EMT proteins play
vital roles in tumour progression, invasion
and metastasis,24 and the PTEN pathway is
involved in EMT signalling in NPC.25­27
The tumour suppressor PTEN is crucial for
multiple cellular processes including cell
proliferation, apoptosis and cell migra-
tion,28,29 and negatively regulates AKT
signalling.24 AKT controls multiple bio-
logical processes including cell proliferation,
differentiation, apoptosis, glucose metabol-
ism, and tumourigenesis,30 and promotes
cell proliferation, survival and metastasis in
NPC via inactivation of FKHR and

BAD.31,32 In accordance with the findings of
others,19 overexpression of miR-205 down-
regulated PTEN and upregulated AKT
levels, in the present study.
Migration and invasion of CNE2 cells
were enhanced by overexpression of miR-
205 in the present study. In addition, mIR-
205 overexpression resulted in downregula-
tion of E-cadherin and upregulation of Snail
proteins. E-cadherin, a member of the
cadherin superfamily, is a calcium-depen-
dent transmembrane glycoprotein involved
in maintaining cell polarity and normal
structure by strengthening intercellular
adhesion.33 Downregulation of E-cadherin
is a marker of EMT changes in epithelial
cells.34 The zinc-finger transcription factor
Snail is a prominent inducer of EMT that
has been shown to inhibit E-cadherin
expression35,36 and PTEN transcription.37
Snail is also associated with radioresis-
tance,37 maintenance of a stem cell-like
phenotype38 and poor prognosis.39 It is
possible that elevated levels of Snail may

present study.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that
miR-205 promotes NPC cell proliferation,
invasion and EMT, and inhibits radiation
induced apoptosis. MiR-205 plays critical
roles in the progression of NPC via regula-
tion of PTEN and AKT signalling, and
may represent a molecular treatment target
for NPC.
