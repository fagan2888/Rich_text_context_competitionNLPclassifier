Abstract
The benefits of minimizing the costs of engaging in violent conflict are thought to have shaped adaptations for the rapid assessment
of others' capacity to inflict physical harm. Although studies have suggested that men's faces and voices both contain information
about their threat potential, one recent study suggested that men's faces are a more valid cue of their threat potential than their
voices are. Consequently, the current study investigated the interrelationships among a composite measure of men's actual threat
potential (derived from the measures of their upper-body strength, height, and weight) and composite measures of these men's
perceived facial and vocal threat potential (derived from dominance, strength, and weight ratings of their faces and voices,
respectively). Although men's perceived facial and vocal threat potential were positively correlated, men's actual threat potential
was related to their perceived facial, but not vocal, threat potential. These results present new evidence that men's faces may be a
more valid cue of these aspects of threat potential than their voices are.

Evidence suggests that aggressive conflict among ancestral
males has been an important selection pressure (Keeley,
1996; Manson et al., 1991) that may have led to adaptations
for assessing the threat potential of others prior to actual com-
bat (Puts, 2010; Sell et al., 2009). Much of the research into
cues of threat potential in humans has investigated the relation-
ships between the measures of men's threat potential (e.g.,
measures of their upper-body strength, height, or weight) and
their facial or vocal characteristics (reviewed in Puts, 2010;
Puts, Jones, & DeBruine 2012).
Several studies have reported positive correlations between
the measures of men's upper-body strength (e.g., their handgrip
strength) and ratings of their faces for dominance or strength
(Fink, Neave, & Seydel, 2007; Holzleitner & Perrett, 2016; Sell
et al., 2009; Windhager, Schaefer, & Fink, 2011). Strength
ratings of men's voices are also positively correlated with the
measures of their actual physical strength (Sell et al., 2010),
and men's voices have been shown to contain acoustic charac-
teristics that are correlated with their strength, height, and/or
weight (Hill et al., 2013; Hodges-Simeon, Gurven, Puts, &
Gaulin, 2014; Pisanski et al., 2016; Puts, Apicella, & Cardenas,
2012). Other work has found that taller men's faces are per-
ceived to be more dominant (Burton & Rule, 2013; Re, DeB-
ruine, Jones, & Perrett, 2013). People can also predict the
winners of mixed martial arts fights from facial cues alone at
levels greater than chance (Little, Tr

faces and voices contain cues of men's threat potential. How-
ever, research reporting that men's fighting ability can be
assessed from their faces, but not their voices, suggests that
faces may be a more valid cue of some aspects of men's threat
potential than their voices are (Doll et al., 2014).
In light of Doll et al.'s (2014) recent findings for fighting
ability, we investigated the relationships among men's actual
threat potential and ratings of both their perceived facial and
vocal threat potential. Men's actual threat potential was
assessed via a composite measure derived from a principal
component analysis (PCA) of their handgrip strength, height,
and weight. Perceived facial and vocal threat potential were
assessed via composite measures derived from PCAs of dom-
inance ratings, strength ratings, and weight ratings of their
faces and voices, respectively. Men's handgrip strength, face
photographs, and voice recordings were collected on five sep-
arate occasions to ensure we obtained representative measures
of men's strength, facial appearance, and vocal appearance.
Given Doll et al.'s (2014) findings, we predicted that the com-
posite measure of men's threat potential would be more
strongly correlated with the composite measure of their per-
ceived facial threat potential than with the composite measure
of their perceived vocal threat potential.
Method
Forty-four men (mean age ¼ 22.02 years, SD ¼ 3.41 years)
each completed five weekly test sessions as part of a larger
study on possible relationships among hormone levels and
voice perceptions (Kandrik et al., 2016). In each of the five
test sessions, each participant first cleaned his face with
hypoallergenic face wipes. A full-face digital photograph was
taken a minimum of 10 min later. Photographs were taken in a
small windowless room against a constant background, under
standardized diffuse lighting conditions, and participants were
instructed to pose with a neutral expression. Camera-to-head
distance and camera settings were held constant. Participants
wore a white smock covering their clothing when photo-
graphed. Photographs were taken using a Nikon D300S digital
camera and a GretagMacbeth 24-square ColorChecker chart
was included in each image for use in color calibration. Fol-
lowing other recent work on social judgments of faces (e.g.,
Jones et al., 2015), face images were color calibrated using a
least-squares transform from an 11-expression polynomial
expansion developed to standardize color information across
the images (Hong, Luo, & Rhodes, 2001). Images were
masked, so that hairstyle and clothing were not visible and
standardized in size and orientation on pupil positions.
In each of the five test sessions, a digital voice recording of
each man was taken in mono using an Audio-Technica
AT-4041 cardioid condenser microphone at a sampling rate
of 44.1 kHz at 16-bit amplitude quantization. Each man was
instructed to say "Hi, I'm a student at the University of
Glasgow" in their normal speaking voice. The word "hi" was
then extracted from each recording for use in the rating part of
the study. The sound pressure level of all voices was amplitude
normalized to 70 dB using the root mean squared method.
In each of the five test sessions, each man's handgrip strength
was measured 4 times using a T. K. K. 5001 Grip A dynam-
ometer, alternating between the dominant (M ¼ 42.15 kgf,
SD ¼ 7.84 kgf) and nondominant (M ¼ 40.02 kgf, SD ¼
6.83 kgf) hand. Two men were left-handed and 42 were right-
handed. In addition, each man's height (M ¼ 178.5 cm, SD ¼
6.75 cm) and weight (M ¼ 72.65 kg, SD ¼ 9.43 kg) was mea-
sured in one of the test sessions. Height, weight, and handgrip
strength have been previously used to assess men's threat poten-
tial (e.g., Puts, Apicella, & Cardenas, 2012).
Next, the face photographs of the 44 men (220 face photo-
graphs in total) and the voice recordings of the 44 men (220
voice recordings in total) were rated for dominance, strength,
and weight using 1 (low) to 7 (high) scales. Faces and voices
were presented in separate blocks of trials, and dominance,
strength, and weight were rated in separate blocks of trials,
respectively. Trial order was fully randomized within each
block. None of the traits were defined for the raters and height
was not rated. Thirty-two men and 47 women (mean age ¼
23.28 years, SD ¼ 4.34 years) rated the faces and voices. The
number of traits that each rater rated varied across raters. Each
individual rater was randomly allocated to rate between two
and four blocks of trials (mean number of raters per block of
trials ¼ 31.83, SD ¼ 3.13). One rater chose not to report their
age. Interrater agreement was high for all combinations of trait
and stimulus type (all Cronbach's as > .89). Consequently, we
calculated the mean dominance (face: M ¼ 3.60, SD ¼ 0.74;
voice: M ¼ 3.86, SD ¼ 0.67), strength (face: M ¼ 3.93, SD ¼
0.81; voice: M ¼ 3.86, SD ¼ 0.72), and weight (face: M ¼ 4.26,
SD ¼ 0.83; voice: M ¼ 4.01, SD ¼ 0.59) rating for each man's
face and voice. Separate analyses of men's and women's rat-
ings showed the same pattern of significant results as analyses
of these combined ratings. Intercorrelations among ratings for
each combination of trait and stimulus type across test sessions
are given in our supplemental materials.
Results
First, we subjected the ratings of men's faces to PCA with
no rotation. This analysis produced a single component that
explained approximately 75% of the variance in scores and was
highly correlated with facial strength (r ¼ .98), dominance (r ¼
.91), and weight (r ¼ .67) ratings. We labeled this component
the perceived facial threat potential component.
Next, we subjected the ratings of men's voices to PCA with
no rotation. This analysis produced a single component that
explained approximately 82% of the variance in scores and was
highly correlated with strength (r ¼ .98), dominance (r ¼ .88),
and weight (r ¼ .85) ratings. We labeled this component the
perceived vocal threat potential component.
We also subjected our four measures of men's threat poten-
tial (handgrip strength for dominant hand, handgrip strength for
nondominant hand, height, and weight) to PCA with no rota-
tion. This analysis produced a single component that explained

approximately 60% of the variance in scores and was highly
correlated with handgrip strength for nondominant hand (r ¼
.93), handgrip strength for dominant hand (r ¼ .89), weight
(r ¼ .68), and height (r ¼ .54). We labeled this component the
actual threat potential component.
Scores on the perceived facial threat potential component
were positively correlated with scores on both the perceived
vocal threat potential component (r ¼ .37, N ¼ 44, p ¼ .012)
and the actual threat potential component (r ¼ .32, N ¼ 44, p ¼
.033). Scores on the perceived vocal threat potential component
and the actual threat potential component were not signifi-
cantly correlated (r ¼ À.02, N ¼ 44, p ¼ .92). Steiger's
(1980) test showed that the correlation between the actual
threat potential component and the perceived facial threat
potential component was significantly stronger than the corre-
lation between the actual threat potential component and the
perceived vocal threat potential component (z ¼ 1.97, p ¼
.049). A table of intercorrelations among all variables is shown
in our Supplemental Materials.
Discussion
PCA of men's handgrip strength, weight, and height produced a
single "actual threat potential" component. This result is con-
sistent with previous work, suggesting that these measures are
positively correlated indices of men's threat potential (Puts,
Apicella, & Cardenas, 2012). Moreover, PCAs of the face and
voice ratings each revealed a single perceived threat potential
component. This result is consistent with previous research,
suggesting that the impressions of men's strength, dominance,
and body size are positively intercorrelated (e.g., Holzleitner &
Perrett, 2016). Further analyses showed that men's perceived
facial threat potential was positively related to their scores on
the actual threat potential component. This result is consistent
with previous research, suggesting that men's faces contain
cues to their actual threat potential (Burton & Rule, 2013; Doll
et al., 2014; Fink et al., 2007; Hill et al., 2013; Holzleitner &
Perrett, 2016; Re et al., 2013; Sell et al., 2009; Windhager et al.,
2011). By contrast with our results for facial dominance, we
found no evidence that people could judge men's threat poten-
tial from their voices. Our results then complement those of
Doll et al. (2014), who found that men's fighting ability could
be better assessed from their faces than their voices. While Doll
et al. (2014) observed this pattern of results when men's threat
potential was measured from acquaintances' ratings of their
fighting ability, here we see the same pattern of results for the
analyses of anthropometric measures of men's threat potential.
While some other studies with larger sample sizes have
reported significant correlations between perceptions of men's
voices and measures of their threat potential (e.g., Sell et al.,
2010), both our results and those of Doll et al. (2014) suggest
that men's faces are more valid cues to their threat potential
than their voices are. Because Doll et al. used full sentences as
their voice stimuli, the pattern of results that we observed in the
current study is unlikely to be a consequence of the short snip-
pets of speech we used as stimuli.
One recent study found that the ratings of men's facial and
vocal dominance were negatively correlated (Rezlescu et al.,
2015). By contrast with Rezlescu et al.'s (2015) results, the
current study found that men's scores on the perceived facial
and vocal threat potential components were positively and sig-
nificantly correlated. In other words, our study found that men
whose faces looked particularly dominant possessed voices that
sounded particularly dominant. The positive correlation
between facial and vocal threat potential observed in the cur-
rent study is consistent with other research reporting correla-
tions between perceptions of faces and voices (reviewed in
Smith, Dunn, Baguley, & Stacey, 2016) and suggests that
men's faces and voices contain some overlapping information
about their perceived threat potential. Our results suggest that
the overlapping information in the perceived dominance of
men's faces and voices is unlikely to include information about
their upper-body strength, height, or weight. It is possible that
this correlation is driven by cues of men's aggressiveness or
emotional state (e.g., anger), rather than threat potential, per se.
In our study, participants rated the faces and voices for
dominance, strength, and weight. It is possible that weight rat-
ings of faces and voices are shaped by cues of adiposity, rather
than formidability, per se. However, the results of our PCAs
show that there is substantial overlap between weight, strength,
and dominance ratings of men's faces (see also voices). Thus,
whatever information participants do use when they rate faces
or voices for weight does seem to be highly correlated with the
information that they use when making more direct assess-
ments of formidability (strength and dominance ratings).
A further unresolved question is what specific facial character-
istics are valid cues of men's threat potential. To date, most
research addressing this question has focused on facial mea-
surements of putative sexually dimorphic aspects of facial mor-
phology. Such measures may be error prone in 2-D images,
however, due to difficulties controlling for head tilt, among
other factors (e.g., Schneider, Hecht, & Carbon, 2012).
In summary, we found that a composite measure of men's
actual threat potential (derived from measures of their upper-
body strength, height, and weight) was positively correlated
with a composite measure of these men's perceived facial, but
not vocal, threat potential (derived from dominance, strength,
and weight ratings of their faces and voices, respectively).
Together with Doll et al.'s (2014) results for men's fighting
ability, these findings suggest that men's faces may be a more
valid cue to some aspects of their threat potential than their
voices are.
