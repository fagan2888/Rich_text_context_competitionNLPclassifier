Article
When social science researchers aim to interrogate social
phenomena and explore a deeper understanding of human
behavior, we often use qualitative research methodologies.
Qualitative research encompasses a range of methodological
approaches such as ethnography, phenomenology, grounded
theory, narrative inquiry, participatory action research, and
case studies, among others. In addition, qualitative research
can involve a variety of data collection methods such as
structured or semistructured interviews, focus groups, par-
ticipant observation, nonparticipant observation, and content
analysis. Paradigmatic differences influence researchers'
approaches to qualitative research and also may be reflected
in how researchers choose to present their findings.
Interpretive frameworks and philosophy in qualitative
research recognize human experience as contextual within a
social time and place, and inseparable from the historical-
personal lens of the researcher(s) (Creswell, 2007). As such,
the positionality and subjectivity of the researcher(s) and the
participants simultaneously shape the epistemological pro-
cess, sometimes obfuscating the notion of voice in the pre-
sentation of the data and results. This article describes our
creative process as we grappled with the representation of
voice in presenting our qualitative research results.
The applicability and impact of qualitative research
within the scientific community and in a greater social con-
text is dependent on effective dissemination of the findings.
Knowledge sharing is an integral component of the research
process; without it, the potentiality of the research findings
to effect change or benefit others is less probable.
Furthermore, the scientific community generally purports
that researchers have an ethical obligation to disseminate
their research to appropriate audiences (Corbin & Strauss,
2008). As such, researchers must envisage the optimal pro-
cesses and techniques for translating data into understand-
able, consumable modes of representation for audiences to
digest. The ability to effectively communicate complex ideas
is critical to facilitate comprehension and eventual utility of
the research findings or translation into practice. Researchers
should strive to demonstrate how the data are meaningful,
appeal to various audiences, and engage stakeholders in the
relevance of the research.
Qualitative researchers face distinct challenges in synthe-
sizing and publishing their work. Unlike quantitative
research, qualitative research often relies on dense tran-
scribed text; these "mountains of words" do not lend them-
selves to the space limitations of academic journals or
condensed visual elements such as summary charts, tables,

Listening to Voices and Visualizing Data
in Qualitative Research: Hypermodal
Dissemination Possibilities
Rasheeta Chandler1, Erica Anstey1, and Henry Ross1
Abstract
One of the tenets of qualitative research is the emphasis and honoring of the participants' own words as generative of meaning
and knowledge; yet it is rare to hear the actual voices of the research participants in a presentation or in text. Qualitative
research dissemination has relied on dense transcribed text; these "mountains of words" do not lend themselves to the
space limitations of academic journals or condensed visual elements such as summary charts, tables, or graphs. Technological
advancements have the potential to revolutionize dissemination efforts, especially for qualitative research. The use of audio
clips in poster and oral presentations, as well as embedded within written manuscripts plays with the interstices between
the research participants and the observer. Infograms are effective ways of conveying a story visually. We demonstrate how
combining audio clips and infographics can be a unique hypermodal dissemination possibility for qualitative results.

or graphs (Johnson, Dunlap, & Benoit, 2010). To maintain
the depth and richness of the findings and to demonstrate the
quality of the data, the presentation of qualitative results
often requires detailed contextual and methodological
description. The use of quotations, presented as text, serve to
exemplify the researchers' interpretation of the data as find-
ings. In today's fast-paced world, presenting qualitative
research succinctly and clearly is becoming more important
and necessary than ever and requires new approaches and
modalities beyond text. In this article, we emphasize the
importance of voice in qualitative research and consider new
possibilities of audio-enhanced dissemination. We also
imagine a hypermodal space where sound is integrated with
innovative data visualization elements.
Voice: Two Sides of the Same Coin
Most modern qualitative researchers subscribe to postposi-
tivist philosophies such as constructivist or postmodern phil-
osophical approaches to research (Creswell, 2007; Gilgun,
2005). Qualitative researchers consider how to best represent
the voices of their participants while acknowledging their
own position in the epistemological process. The importance
of narrative voice in qualitative research dissemination is
evident in the author's decision to write in first person or
third person. First person case acknowledges the researcher's
positionality and role in the process, and ideally minimizes
the privileging of a single "objective" voice that silences the
voice of others. Third person case is a more traditional
approach in the hard sciences and is intended to express a
sense of epistemological objectivity and distance the
researcher from the participants. Feminist and postmodern
scholars (see Clarke, 2003; Haraway, 1988; Harding, 1993;
Hooks, 1990) have long advocated for scientists and
researchers to identify and reveal their particular locations,
or "standpoints" in knowledge formation. These "situated
knowledges" challenge the traditional scientific relativism
that often drives quantitative biomedical research by offering
the possibility of generating new approaches from the merg-
ing of multiple perspectives. Gilgun (2005) wrote, "many
contemporary researchers believe that the materials research-
ers generate are co-constructions, representations of interac-
tive processes between researchers and researched" (p. 258).
Furthermore, she wrote, "The use of the first person and of
direct quotes is a way of acknowledging that the voices of
researchers and those whom we research are not the same yet
are interconnected" (p. 259). This interpretive qualitative
approach also offers a sense of transparency to the reader.
The emphasis and honoring of the participants' own
words as generative of meaning and knowledge is also criti-
cally important to include in writing and presenting qualita-
tive research (the other side of the coin), yet it is rare to hear
the actual voices of the research participants in dissemina-
tion efforts. Decisions about the representation of voice raise
questions about the subjectivity of the "knower" and the pro-
cess of sharing research findings. Negotiating the voice of
the researcher with the voice of the participant in the dis-
semination process is an important part of qualitative
research. Lincoln, Lynham, and Guba (2011) explained,
"Today . . . voice can mean not only having a real researcher--
and a researcher's voice--in the text, but also letting research
participants speak for themselves" (p. 123). Although the
intention is to simultaneously blend the voice of the partici-
pants with that of the researcher, inevitably, the representa-
tions of voice in dissemination efforts are reflective of the
positionality of the researcher, who ultimately has the power
to make choices about what to include or not. Participatory
action research offers perhaps a more egalitarian possibility
but is not without its challenges as well.
Today, qualitative researchers are able to capture the
voices of participants during data collection through record-
ing technology such as tape recorders and, more recently,
with digital voice recorders and mobile phones. Researchers
often use audio and/or visual recording devices with com-
mon qualitative methods such as interviews, direct observa-
tion and participant observation, focus groups, and case
studies. This type of audio recording technology facilitates
the analytic process by enabling verbatim transcription of the
verbal content and nonverbal elements into text and main-
tains the integrity of the data so that the researcher may
repeatedly listen to the nuances of the vocal expression.
Although the use of audio, video, and other visual meth-
ods have become common in data collection procedures,
innovation continues to broaden the availability of new
approaches to qualitative research. For example, PhotoVoice
integrates technology in an effort to create a space in which
participants' perspectives, particularly marginalized groups,
can be expressed (Catalani & Minkler, 2010). Computer
assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) can
accommodate audio and video files, which has transformed
data analysis. However, the inclusion of visual and audio ele-
ments in dissemination efforts remains relatively untapped.
The journal, Sociological Research Online, does support mul-
timodal elements and has published articles that include pho-
tos and video that can be viewed by the "reader"; however,
the editors note that despite the possibility of presenting
research in innovative ways, authors do not take advantage of
these possibilities frequently (Coomber & Letherby, 2012).
We are interested in the potential for technological advance-
ments and innovations in data representation and presentation
to enhance qualitative research dissemination and the learn-
ing experience. We imagine that hypermodal dissemination
efforts will integrate multiple and various modalities of com-
munication and rely on thoughtful design and execution.
The Enhancing Audio Recorded
Research (EARR) Model
We developed the EARR model (Figure 1; Chandler, Anstey,
& Munro, et al., 2013) while working to integrate audio into
a poster presentation of research findings from a study
designed to identify the HIV prevention needs of Black
Chandler et al. 3
college women. During poster design, we struggled with
how to retain the emphasis and meaning of the words spoken
by our participants during the focus groups but which seemed
to dissipate on paper. For example, complex emotions about
relationships with their parents, feelings of stigma, and gen-
erational attitudes about sex and communicating with part-
ners were evidenced through the cadence of speech and
expression shared. Feeling compelled to restore the richness
of these women's words, we explored possibilities for
enabling our audience to experience the voices of our partici-
pants as we did during the focus group sessions.
The impetus for the development of the EARR model was
to more fully honor the voices of our research participants by
enabling our audiences to experience the power of the data
through listening to it with their own ears. Coupled with our
interpretations of the data, analysis, and conclusions as
researchers, the ability to experience the raw data in the form
of audio has the potentiality to engage the audience with
another dimension of the research. Although we typically
include quotes from participants on posters or in oral presen-
tations, we felt as though our findings would be better
expressed by the exact words, inflection, and intonations of
our participants. We applied the contextual model of learning
as a framework to contextualize the process of disseminating
research within the learning environment intended by the
professional scientific conference setting (Chandler, Anstey,
& Munro, et al.,, 2013; Falk & Dierking, 2000). Development
of the EARR model emerged as we delved into the history of
museum informatics, which has evolved from basic identify-
ing labels to modern-day interactive audiovisual technolo-
gies that are intended to engage the visitor more wholly in
the museum experience (Chandler, Anstey, & Munro, et al.,
2013; Falk & Dierking, 2000; Marty & Burton Jones, 2008;
Tallon & Walker, 2008). The EARR model illustrates the
possibilities of integrating multisensory modalities into qual-
itative research dissemination as generative of new semiotic
possibilities. King (2008) proposed that the human brain has
evolved to develop, learn, and operate optimally in multisen-
sory environments. More specifically, King suggests that the
visual and auditory systems frequently work together to
stimulate cognition. The EARR model facilitates a multisen-
sory learning approach that pushes the boundaries of tradi-
tional research dissemination and invites new opportunities
for critical analysis. A more detailed explanation of the his-
tory of museum informatics, ethical issues, and a theoretical
approach specific to the proposed hypermodal medium as it

relates to qualitative dissemination, and the development of
the EARR model, is published elsewhere (Chandler, Anstey,
& Munro, et al., 2013).
The qualitative HIV prevention study that informed the
EARR model was approved by the study site's institutional
review board. We obtained consent/authorization from each
participant, which permitted audio recording of focus group
sessions, transcription of the digital media into text format,
and clipping (90 s or less) of available audio files for use in
dissemination of the findings.
Not all research is well suited to the inclusion of audio
data in the dissemination of research findings, particularly
when the potential for voice recognition to remove anonym-
ity could be harmful to the participants. However, several
researchers have demonstrated the potentiality of removing
anonymity to empower or enfranchise participants who may
be marginalized, especially if there is an iterative, active role
for the participant in the dissemination decisions and process
(Fahmy & Pemberton, 2012; Pink & Mackley, 2012). For
example, Fahmy and Pemberton (2012) described their use
of video throughout the research process to empower mar-
ginalized groups and give them "voice" "within wider public
debates and policy development." They suggested that
Visual methods offer also one important means of overcoming
the objectification of research subjects as disembodied textual
and numeric data within the interpretation and subsequent
dissemination of findings. The visual representation of subjects'
perspectives within their natural setting can provide for more
holistic interpretations thereby enhancing the ecological validity
of findings.
We contend that the inclusion of audio in dissemination of
the findings has the potential to similarly enhance the valid-
ity of findings by respecting the identity of the participants
and offering the audience additional insight into the interpre-
tive, analytic process.
Incorporating an audio component to qualitative research
dissemination has the potential to offer audiences a unique
way to more fully engage with the data and reflect on the
interpretations and analytic process of the researcher. In
applying the EARR model in a poster presentation (see
Figure 2), we were able to allow conference-goers the oppor-
tunity to listen to the voices of our participants. The steps of
the EARR model in our pilot test were as follows:
1. We selected audio clips from our digitally recorded
data files that best represented the thematic findings
in a focus group study about the information, motiva-
tion, and behavioral skills (IMB) HIV prevention
needs of Black college women attending two differ-
ent universities in Florida.
2. We uploaded the audio clips into the Guide-by-Cell
web-based software program. The audio files were
then accessible via dial-by-number or quick response
(QR) code. We printed the phone number and the QR
code on the poster.
3. As conference attendees viewed our poster, we
encouraged them to use their mobile devices to call
the number or scan the QR code to listen to audio
clips of our participants that represented particular
themes. We also provided over-the-ear headphones to
assist with hearing these clips in a loud conference
environment.
4. We also encouraged our audience to respond to a poll
about this audio-enhanced experience, which was
also possible through the audio guide program (by
calling or by QR code). Finally, we encouraged our
audience to respond to the research and the audio-
enhanced aspect of the presentation through record-
ing their own perspectives.
Our initial experience suggests that implementation of the
EARR model enabled a deeper expression of the findings by
revealing voice inflection, tone, and emotion that are often dif-
ficult to communicate through traditional dissemination chan-
nels. Furthermore, when audiences receive information in this
way, they enter into the hermeneutic circle of interpretation
alongside the researchers and the research participants.
Qualitative Data Visualization
In considering the integration of additional modalities to fur-
ther push the boundaries of qualitative research dissemina-
tion, we also began to explore various methods of data
visualization techniques. We typically think about data visu-
alization in the context of quantitative (numerical) data that
may be represented through a variety of visual options such
as bar charts, graphs, scatterplots, tables, and pie charts,
among others. These visual options serve to synthesize the
findings in an easily interpretable manner. Data visualization
of qualitative research has received minimal attention thus
far (Sloan, 2009). Miles and Huberman (1994) were among
the first to describe the importance of some visual data dis-
play methods (such as matrices and network displays) in
qualitative research dissemination. More recently, represent-
ing qualitative data visually has received more attention as
CAQDAS and other tools have facilitated this possibility.
For example, tables and matrices, network mapping, word
clouds, and word trees have become more common in quali-
tative dissemination efforts (Henderson & Segal, 2013;
Verdinelli & Scagnoli, 2013). Sloan (2009) described the use
of a device called "the Spectrum" to visually display qualita-
tive information. This method is useful for displaying patterns
in the data visually, but relies on the use of symbols or codes
to represent the data and does not incorporate the words of
participants. Verdinelli and Scagnoli (2013) studied the types
of visual displays of qualitative data in published articles
from three esteemed qualitative research journals across 3
years. Most common were matrices, networks, flowcharts,

boxed displays, and modified Venn diagrams, followed by
taxonomies, ladders, metaphorical visual displays, and deci-
sion tree modeling. These analytic display methods are use-
ful for summarizing emerging theories from the data and
primary thematic results.
Although these traditional methods of visualization are
important for systematically displaying research findings,
they typically exclude the voices of participants and may
lack visual dynamism of the data. Our project then is to bal-
ance the need for structural methods designed to explain the
research with the integral subtleties and emotive elements
that are characteristic of some qualitative studies. Interactive
data visualization techniques could be combined with other
modalities to present a complex story in a dynamic and trans-
parent way. According to Henderson, data visualization can
be defined broadly as
"communicating ideas or data using diagrams, images, graphs,
maps, or some other kind of visual model with the goal/intention
of increasing understanding." And that last piece is important--
the visualization has to be something that increases
understanding, insight, or something else besides just being
attractive or pretty. (Eliot, 2012)
Qualitative researchers should begin to explore the ways
that we can present data such that the information is pre-
sented visually, yet the point is synthesized clearly and suc-
cinctly, but also honoring of the participants' own voices.
Infographics, for example, have become a popular 21st-
century trend used to display quantitative data. An info-
graphic is a visual display of information that is presented in
a way that communicates a compelling story about data.
According to Lankow (2012), "Infographics provide a for-
mat that utilizes engaging visuals that not only appeal to an
audience hungry for information, but also aid in the compre-
hension and retention of that material" (p. 12). In his book,
Lankow defined "data" to be "quantifiable information" that
is typically numerical. He outlined three elements of effec-
tive verbal/visual methods of communication:
1. Appeal: Communication should engage a voluntary
audience.
2. Comprehension: Communication should effectively
provide knowledge that enables a clear understand-
ing of the information.
3. Retention: Communication should impart memora-
ble knowledge.
However, because infographics are also about storytelling,
they may lend themselves to qualitative data presentation.
Infographics also have varying levels of complexity that can
serve different needs. Krum (2014) outlined six different lev-
els of infographics in order of increasing complexity: static,
zooming, clicking, animated, video, and interactive, inspiring
us to imagine endless exciting possibilities for disseminating
qualitative research.
If a picture is worth a thousand words, what may emerge
when we display a picture, juxtaposed with audio? Data visu-
alization (such as infographics) plus audio could appeal to
multiple types of learning modalities (linguistic and nonlin-
guistic) and ultimately enhance learning and understanding.
We have been playing with different possibilities of blending
visual and audio elements together in disseminating qualita-
tive research. In the spirit of hypermodal exploration, we share
our fledgling example (Figure 3) of our research findings.
Our intention in designing this "qualitative infographic"
was to explore how we might present a succinct synthesis of
thematic findings while honoring the voices of our partici-
pants in an integrated way. The visual elements with captions
display the main themes that were important in this study and
the corresponding audio map enables the audience to listen
to a summary of the findings and the words of the partici-
pants. The opportunity for active engagement with the data
may motivate the audience to reflect on the nuances of mean-
ing expressed by the participants and synthesized by the
researchers, enhancing their learning experience. Pink and
Mackley (2012) described the inclusion of video in present-
ing their research as a way "to offer an opportunity for view-
ers to develop a sensory embodied engagement with the
materials and, as such, to use such familiarities and discrep-
ancies as routes to emplaced knowing, imagining and forms
of understanding."(p. 12) Similarly, as this project develops,
we aim to encourage "readers" to enter a multimodal context
where you may engage with the research more wholly,
invoking iterative, situated processes and leading to the
coconstruction of meaning.
Throughout this project, we have been interested in
exploring the possibilities of integrating audio technology
and data visualization into qualitative research dissemination
projects. The use of audio clips and data visualization in
poster and oral presentations, as well as embedded within
written manuscripts plays with the interstices between the
research participants and the observer. What new knowledge
is gained when we access and privilege the voices of research
participants juxtaposed with text and visual elements? What
new possibilities will emerge when the voices of our partici-
pants become liminal? Specifically, as "readers" of this arti-
cle, how can you enter into the hypermodal space with us and
become yet another modality in the epistemological process,
thus adding a layer of complexity to the semiotics of this
project through coconstruction.
In this "article," we encourage you (the reader/listener) to
actively engage with the audio map we have developed in the
example above to experience the application of audio tech-
nology and listen to the voices that constitute data. We hope
you will also take the opportunity to join the conversation
about the use of this technology, thus entering into our her-
meneutic circle and actively contributing to the exploration
Chandler et al. 7
and evolution of hypermodal spaces in qualitative research.
Future conversations might explore whether the (re)presenta-
tion of qualitative research through these new modalities
destabilizes the construction of authoritative knowledge.
