trend is continuing.
METHODS
Prevalence estimates of overweight and
obesity were calculated using data from
the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES), a com-
plex, multistage probability sample of
the US civilian, noninstitutionalized
population.6 Race/ethnicity was re-
ported by survey participants. During
a physical examination in a mobile ex-
amination center, height and weight
were measured using standardized pro-
tocols and calibrated equipment. Body
mass index (BMI) was calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters and was
rounded to the nearest tenth.
The NHANES 2003-2004 overall
response rate (of those originally
selected for participation) was 68.6%
(4742/6916) for adults aged 20 years
or older and 83.2% (4105/4932) for

Context The prevalence of overweight in children and adolescents and obesity in
adults in the United States has increased over several decades.
Objective To provide current estimates of the prevalence and trends of overweight
in children and adolescents and obesity in adults.
Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of height and weight measurements
from 3958 children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years and 4431 adults aged 20 years
or older obtained in 2003-2004 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of the US population. Data
from the NHANES obtained in 1999-2000 and in 2001-2002 were compared with data
from 2003-2004.
Main Outcome Measures Estimates of the prevalence of overweight in children
and adolescents and obesity in adults. Overweight among children and adolescents was
defined as at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific body mass index (BMI) for
age growth charts. Obesity among adults was defined as a BMI of 30 or higher; ex-
treme obesity was defined as a BMI of 40 or higher.
Results In 2003-2004, 17.1% of US children and adolescents were overweight and
32.2% of adults were obese. Tests for trend were significant for male and female children
and adolescents, indicating an increase in the prevalence of overweight in female children
and adolescents from 13.8% in 1999-2000 to 16.0% in 2003-2004 and an increase in
the prevalence of overweight in male children and adolescents from 14.0% to 18.2%.
Amongmen,theprevalenceofobesityincreasedsignificantlybetween1999-2000(27.5%)
and 2003-2004 (31.1%). Among women, no significant increase in obesity was observed
between 1999-2000 (33.4%) and 2003-2004 (33.2%). The prevalence of extreme obe-
sity (body mass index 40) in 2003-2004 was 2.8% in men and 6.9% in women. In
2003-2004, significant differences in obesity prevalence remained by race/ethnicity and
by age. Approximately 30% of non-Hispanic white adults were obese as were 45.0% of
non-Hispanic black adults and 36.8% of Mexican Americans. Among adults aged 20 to
39 years, 28.5% were obese while 36.8% of adults aged 40 to 59 years and 31.0% of
those aged 60 years or older were obese in 2003-2004.
Conclusions The prevalence of overweight among children and adolescents and obe-
sity among men increased significantly during the 6-year period from 1999 to 2004; among
women, no overall increases in the prevalence of obesity were observed. These esti-
mates were based on a 6-year period and suggest that the increases in body weight are
continuing in men and in children and adolescents while they may be leveling off in women.

children and adolescents aged 2 to 19
years. Less than 3% of examined chil-
dren and adolescents and 7% of adults
had missing data for BMI. Data for
analyses were available for 3958 chil-
dren and adolescents and 4431 adults
in 2003-2004 (TABLE 1), in addition
to previously published data for 1999-
2000 and 2001-2002.3-5
Among children and adolescents
aged 2 to 19 years, overweight and at
risk for overweight were defined based
on the sex-specific BMI for age growth
charts from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.7 The CDC
growth charts were created from na-
tional data in the United States col-
lected from 1963 through 1994. Data
for the BMI for age charts were col-
lected between 1971 and 1994 for chil-
dren 2 to 6 years of age and be-
tween 1963 and 1980 for children 6
through 19 years of age. The "at risk for
overweight" category was defined as a
BMI for age at or above the sex-
specific 85th percentile but less than the
95th percentile.8 Overweight was de-
fined as a BMI for age at or above the
sex-specific 95th percentile. For adults
aged 20 years or older, overweight was
defined as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9; obe-
sity, 30.0 or higher; and extreme obe-
sity, 40.0 or higher.9
Statistical analyses were performed
using SAS (version 9, SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (version 9, Re-
search Triangle Institute, Research Tri-
angle Park, NC) software. All analyses
excluded pregnant females. Sample
weights were used to account for
differential nonresponse, noncover-
age, and to adjust for planned over-
sampling of some groups. Estimates for
adults were age-standardized to the pro-
jected estimates of the 2000 US Cen-
sus using the age groups of 20 to 39
years, 40 to 59 years, and 60 years or
older. SEs for all survey years were es-
timated with SUDAAN software using
Taylor series linearization.
Trends in prevalence of overweight
for children and adolescents and in
obesity for adults over 1999-2000,
2001-2002, and 2003-2004 were mod-
eled separately using logistic regres-
sion. To test for trends, the NHANES
survey years were included as an
ordinal variable in logistic regression
models that included age group and
race/ethnicity. Trends were similarly
tested using 6 separate years of data
for 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003,
and 2004.
An interaction was found between
sex and the NHANES survey years so
the models were run separately for
males and females. All 2-way interac-
tion terms were dropped from the sex-
specific models because they were
not statistically significant. No 3-way
interactions were tested. Because no in-
teraction was found between race/
ethnicity and the NHANES survey
years, tests for differences between
racial/ethnic groups were performed
in these models with the 3 NHANES
survey periods (1999-2000, 2001-
2002, 2003-2004). In contrast, overall
differences by sex were tested in 2003-
2004 using t tests at the .05 signifi-
cance level for adults and for children
and adolescents separately.
RESULTS
Overall, among children and adoles-
cents aged 2 to 19 years, 17.1% were
overweight in 2003-2004 and 32.2% of
adults aged 20 years or older were
obese. The prevalence of extreme obe-
sity among adults was 4.8%. Detailed
prevalence estimates of overweight in
children and adolescents (TABLE 2
and TABLE 3) and obesity in adults
(TABLE 4 and TABLE 5) are shown by
sex, age group, and race/ethnicity for
2003-2004.
Prevalence estimates of overweight
and at risk for overweight in children
and adolescents and overweight, obe-
sity, and extreme obesity among adults
for 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 also ap-
pear in Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5. Tests of
trend using logistic regression ad-
justed for age and race/ethnicity showed
a significant increase in the prevalence
of overweight in children and adoles-
cents over 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and
2003-2004 (P = .0396 for males and
P=.0463 for females). Among men, the
increase in obesity was not significant
(P=.0503). Tests for trends using 6
single years of data showed significant
increases in prevalence of obesity for
men (P=.02) and overweight for male
children and adolescents (P=.01), but
no significant increase in overweight for
femalechildrenandadolescents(P=.10).
Among women, no significant trends
were found using either test of trends.

from1999-2000,2001-2002,and2003-

Mexican American male children and
adolescents was significantly greater
than in non-Hispanic white male chil-
dren and adolescents. However, preva-
lence of overweight among non-
Hispanic white male children and
adolescents did not differ significantly
from non-Hispanic black male chil-
dren and adolescents. Mexican Ameri-
canandnon-Hispanicblackfemalechil-
dren and adolescents were significantly
more likely to be overweight com-
pared with non-Hispanic white female
children and adolescents. Adolescents
were more likely to be overweight com-
pared with children. Among children
and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years in
2003-2004, no significant difference in
prevalence of overweight was found
between the sexes.
Among adult men, no differences
were found between racial/ethnic
groups (Table 6). However, Mexican
American and non-Hispanic black
women were significantly more likely
to be obese compared with non-
Hispanic white women. Older adults
were more likely to be obese than their
younger counterparts. The only excep-
tion was adults aged 80 years or older
who were not significantly different
from adults aged 20 to 39 years (for
both sexes). In 2003-2004, there was
no significant difference in the preva-
lence of obesity in adults between
the sexes.

COMMENT
These estimates from the NHANES con-
ducted in 2003-2004 provide the most
recent prevalence estimates of over-
weight and obesity in the United States.
Among children and adolescents aged
2 to 19 years, 17.1% were overweight
and 32.2% of adults aged 20 years or
older were obese. The prevalence of
overweight among children and ado-
lescents and obesity among men in-
creased significantly between 1999 and
2004. No increase in overall obesity
prevalence among women was ob-
served over the 6-year period.
Multivariable model results indi-
cate that the only statistically signifi-
cant trends were those noted overall
for men and for children and adoles-
cents. Trends did not differ signifi-
cantly by age or racial/ethnic group.
Although differences in point esti-
mates may appear large in some sub-
groups, the differences are not statisti-
cally significant. Subgroup estimates
by sex, age, and race/ethnicity are less
precise than the overall estimates.
This is due to smaller sample sizes
and fewer degrees of freedom than for
the overall estimates. Future data
from NHANES 2005-2006 should
provide more information about
changes in subgroups.

Increases in prevalence of over-
weight and obesity among both adults
andchildrenhavebeenobservedinmany
countries throughout the world.10,11 For
example, the prevalence of obesity
among adults in Great Britain almost
tripledbetween1980and2002.12 Among
preschool children in urban areas of
China, the prevalence of obesity in-
creased from 1.5% in 1989 to 12.6% in
1997.13
Similar to previous analyses,4,5 there
continues to be differences in over-
weight and obesity prevalence by
racial/ethnic group among women and
among children and adolescents.
Among women, almost 58% of non-
Hispanic black women aged 40 to 59
years were obese in 2003-2004 com-
pared with about 38% of non-Hispanic
white women of the same age. Among
men, however, the prevalence of obe-
sity did not differ by racial/ethnic
group. Among children and adoles-
cents, differences by racial/ethnic
group exist for both sexes. These
racial/ethnic group differences in
female children and adolescents
were observed in 1988-1994 but
these differences were not observed
among male adolescents in 1988-
1994.4
The prevalence of overweight and
obesity in the United States remains
high. The prevalence of obesity has con-
tinued to increase in men and the preva-
lence of overweight has continued to
increase in children and adolescents be-
tween 1999 and 2004. However, no sig-
nificant increases were observed among
women. There is little indication that
the prevalence is decreasing in any sub-
group of the population. These preva-
lence estimates, based on a 6-year pe-
riod (1999-2004), suggest that the
increases in body weight may be level-
ing off in women.
