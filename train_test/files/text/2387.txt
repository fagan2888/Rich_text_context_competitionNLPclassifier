Objective: We aimed to describe temporal changes in substance use among HIV-
infected pregnant women in the United States from 1990 to 2012.
Design: Data came from two prospective cohort studies (Women and Infants Trans-
mission Study and Surveillance Monitoring for Antiretroviral Therapy Toxicities Study).
Methods: Women were classified as using a substance during pregnancy if they self-
reported use or had a positive biological sample. To account for correlation between
repeated pregnancies by the same woman, generalized estimating equation models
were used to test for temporal trends and evaluate predictors of substance use.
Results: Over the 23-year period, substance use among the 5451 HIV-infected preg-
nant women sharply declined; 82% of women reported substance use during pregnancy
in 1990, compared with 23% in 2012. Use of each substance decreased significantly
(P < 0.001 for each substance) in an approximately linear fashion, until reaching a
plateau in 2006. Multivariable models showed substance use was inversely associated
with receiving antiretroviral therapy. Among the subset of 824 women with multiple
pregnancies under observation, women who used a substance in their previous
pregnancy were at elevated risk of substance use during their next pregnancy (risk
ratio, 5.71; 95% confidence interval, 4.63­7.05).
Conclusion: A substantial decrease in substance use during pregnancy was observed
between 1990 and 2012 in two large US cohorts of HIV-infected women. Substance use
prevalence in these cohorts became similar to that of pregnant women in the general US
population by the mid-2000s, suggesting that the observed decrease may be due to an
epidemiological transition of the HIV epidemic among women in the United States.

Introduction
Approximately 8700 HIV-infected women give birth in
the United States annually [1,2]. Rates of substance use in
this population have historically been high; in the late
1980s and early 1990s, half of HIV-infected pregnant
women used illicit substances [3,4]. Substance use during
pregnancy in HIV-infected women has negative implica-
tions for transmission [5­8], infant outcomes [9­19], and
the health of the mother [20].
Over time, the route of HIV acquisition among women
has changed in the United States. Whereas approximately
50% of female AIDS cases were linked to injection drug
use in 1990 [21], by 2011, it was the suspected source of
infection in only 14% of HIV diagnoses among women
[22]. However, to our knowledge, no studies have
examined substance use patterns in HIV-infected
pregnant women over the last two decades.
Using data from two large US-based cohorts, we describe
the dramatic decrease in maternal substance use during
pregnancy from 1990 to 2012 among HIV-infected
women,and explore possible explanations for the decrease.
Methods
Study participants and design
This study included women enrolled in the Women and
Infants Transmission Study (WITS) or the Surveillance
Monitoring for Antiretroviral Therapy Toxicities
(SMARTT) protocol of the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort
Study (PHACS). WITS enrolled women who gave birth
from 1990 to 2005 [23], whereas SMARTT is ongoing,
with the first delivery occurring in 1995 [24]. In WITS/
SMARTT, written informed consent was obtained from
each participating woman, and the institutional review
board at each study center approved study protocols.
In WITS, women had multiple study visits during
pregnancy. In SMARTT, two groups of women and
children (dynamic and static) were enrolled. In the
dynamic cohort, women were enrolled during pregnancy
through 72 h postdelivery. The static cohort enrolled
women with children aged 0­12 years. For both WITS
and SMARTT, trained study personnel conducted
structured interviews at enrollment to assess demographic
characteristics.
Women were eligible for this study if they were enrolled
in WITS/SMARTT, gave birth from 1 January 1990 to
31 December 2012, and provided self-reported infor-
mation on substance use during pregnancy.
Substance use
In WITS, a questionnaire was administered at each
predelivery visit to ascertain use of alcohol, tobacco,
marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and injected drugs during
pregnancy. One urine sample for drug testing was
collected at the intake visit and one was collected during
labor or immediately postpartum. Urine was screened
for cocaine, heroin/opiates, marijuana, alcohol, or their
metabolites using a radioimmunoassay followed by
confirmatory gas chromatography and mass spectrometry
[7].
Women in dynamic SMARTT completed a substance use
interview within 7 days of delivery, and women in static
SMARTT completed this interview at time of enrollment
[median ¼ 3.7 years after pregnancy, interquartile range
(IQR) ¼ 1.8­6.2 years]. In a subsample of the dynamic
cohort, meconium ­ an infant's first stool ­ was collected
and screened for cocaine, heroin/opiates, marijuana,
alcohol, tobacco, or their metabolites using an immu-
noassay technique followed by confirmatory gas chroma-
tography and mass spectrometry [25].
Women were classified as using a substance if they self-
reported or had a positive biological sample for alcohol,
tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, or heroin during pregnancy.
Polysubstance use was defined as using two or more
substances during pregnancy.
Statistical methods
The proportion of women in each substance use category
was calculated, stratified by year of delivery. To test
whether the proportion of women using substances
during pregnancy changed over time while accounting
for correlation between repeated pregnancies, we used
log binomial generalized estimating equation (GEE)
models. As meconium samples were not available for all
SMARTT participants, we conducted two sensitivity
analyses; the first included only WITS pregnancies,
whereas the second also included the SMARTT
pregnancies with meconium data.
Multivariable logistic GEE models were constructed to
evaluate predictors of substance use in the pre-highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (1990­1995) and
HAART (1996­2012) eras. These models included race/
ethnicity, age, education, household income, marital
status, HIV diagnosis prior to pregnancy, and antire-
troviral therapy regimen.
To evaluate trends within individuals, log binomial GEE
models were used in the subset of women with multiple
pregnancies under observation in WITS/SMARTT.
We compared substance use prevalence in WITS/
SMARTT with use among pregnant women in a
nationally representative household survey, the National
Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). In NSDUH,
substance use during pregnancy is defined as self-report of
past 30-day substance use and being pregnant. We
compared WITS/SMARTT and NSDUH beginning in
118 AIDS 2015, Vol 29 No 1

1994 [26­44], the first year NSDUH collected data
on pregnancy.
All analyses were performed in SAS version 9.2 (SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA).
Results
Of the 5724 pregnancies in WITS/SMARTT, we
excluded 233 because self-reported substance use infor-
mation was unavailable and 40 because delivery year was
unknown. Therefore, a total of 5451 pregnancies from
4408 individual women were included in this analysis.
Maternal characteristics for each pregnancy are described
in Table 1.
Nearly 82% of respondents used at least one substance in
1990; this proportion decreased linearly over time until
2006, when it plateaued at approximately 23% (Fig. 1).
A similar pattern was observed for each individual
substance over the 23-year period. The prevalence of
tobacco use decreased from 64.9 to 18.2%; alcohol from
57.4 to 9.3%; marijuana from 25.5 to 6.7%; cocaine from
36.2 to 1.3%; and heroin from 27.7 to 0.0%. The
prevalence of injection drug use declined from a peak of
17.1% in 1991 to 0.0%, and polysubstance use fell from
64.9% in 1990 to approximately 10% from 2007 onwards
(data not shown).

All decreases were statistically significant. Each year, risk of
substance use among HIV-infected pregnant women
decreased by 6%, on an average [risk ratio (RR), 0.94;
95% confidence interval (CI), 0.94­0.95]. The largest
reductions in risk over the 23-year period were for
injection drugs (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.77­0.83), heroin
(RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.85­0.88), and cocaine (RR, 0.87;
95% CI, 0.86­0.88). The smallest reductions in risk were
for marijuana (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.93­0.96) and tobacco
(RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.94­0.95). Both sensitivity analyses
produced estimates comparable to those presented above.
In the pre-HAART and HAART eras, multivariable
models showed non-Hispanic white race, older age, less
education, and being unmarried were associated with
substance use during pregnancy (Table 1). In the pre-
HAARTera, not receiving any antiretroviral therapy was
associated with substance use [odds ratio (OR), 1.50; 95%
CI, 1.15­1.95]. Similarly, in the HAART era, women
receiving no antiretroviral therapy (OR, 2.12; 95% CI,
1.54­2.92), zidovudine monotherapy (OR, 2.37; 95% CI,
1.88­2.98), or another non-HAART antiretroviral
therapy (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11­1.61) had greater odds
of substance use, compared with women receiving
HAART.
Of the 4408 women included in the previous analysis,
824 had multiple pregnancies under study observation.
For most substances, the risk of a woman using the
substance did not change with successive pregnancies;
the association between pregnancy order and use of
tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, any substance,
multiple substances, or injected drugs was not statistically
significant. Risk of alcohol use was slightly reduced in
later pregnancies (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.82­1.00). Of
note, women who used a substance in their previous
pregnancy had an elevated risk of substance use during
their next pregnancy (RR, 5.71; 95% CI, 4.63­7.05).
We compared annual prevalence of alcohol, tobacco,
marijuana, cocaine, and heroin use during pregnancy
among HIV-infected women in WITS/SMARTT with
estimates from NSDUH (see Figures, Supplemental
Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/QAD/A595).
From 1994 to the early 2000s, use of these substances was
substantially higher among women in WITS/SMARTT,
compared with pregnant women in the general
population. However, from the mid-2000s to 2012,
prevalence of substance use appears comparable between
the two groups.
Discussion
We describe the substantial decline in licit and illicit
substance use during pregnancy that occurred between
1990 and 2012 in a population of two US-based cohorts
of HIV-infected women. Although the prevalence of
substance use was initially considerably higher in WITS/
SMARTT, it has become similar to that of pregnant
women in the general US population.
Women who used substances in previous pregnancies had
over a five-fold increased risk of using a substance in
future pregnancies. Therefore, we posit that the observed
decrease in substance use is not due to the cessation of
substance use in women who previously used substances,
but rather, HIV is affecting a different population of
women. It is possible that an epidemiological transition
has occurred, in which the types of women becoming
infected with HIV in the Unites States has changed. This
is supported by data from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, which show that the primary route of
infection among women has gradually transitioned from
injection drug use to heterosexual contact [21,22].
We observed that substance use is inversely associated
with receiving antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women,
consistent with a past study of HIV-infected adults [45].
Others have reported current injection drug users were
less likely than past users to receive antiretroviral therapy
[46], and substance users not enrolled in treatment
programmes were less likely to receive antiretroviral
therapy than those receiving treatment [47]. Because
substance use is inversely associated with antiretroviral
therapy and a number of potential outcomes, it may be an
important confounder in antiretroviral safety studies,
especially those using historical comparison data.
Our study has several limitations. First, our sample may
not represent the larger population of HIV-infected
women who gave birth from 1990 to 2012. Second,
different biological specimens were used to confirm
substance use in each cohort. Urine-based and meco-
nium-based tests have varying sensitivity, specificity, and
windows of detection [48­50]. Third, only 22% of
women in SMARTT had meconium samples analyzed
for substances, and some women in the static SMARTT
cohort had long recall periods. However, restricting our
analysis to women with available biological assays suggest

that our findings are not explained by recall or social
desirability bias. Furthermore, past analyses of the
dynamic SMARTT cohort have shown reliable sensitivity
and specificity of self-reported substance use compared
with biological measures [25]. Fourth, NSDUH's
classification of substance use during pregnancy (being
pregnant and using a substance in the past month) differs
from that of WITS and SMARTT, and was not
confirmed by biological assays, meaning data from
NSDUH in the Supplemental Digital Content may be
underestimated (http://links.lww.com/QAD/A595).
Finally, this analysis could not investigate temporal trends
in prescription opioids because WITS did not collect the
necessary information. However, few women in
SMARTT (4.4%) reported medical or nonmedical use
of prescription opioids during pregnancy.
This study provides important information about temporal
trends in substance use among HIV-infected pregnant
women in the United States. We documented a dramatic
decrease in prevalence of substance use during pregnancy
since 1990, which may be due to a shift in the HIV
epidemic among women in the United States. The finding
that substance use during pregnancy has historically been
associated with lack of antiretroviral use is concerning and
may warrant further investigation. Our observation that
HIV-infected women who used substances in past
pregnancies are at increased risk of use during future
pregnancies suggests they may be important to target in
efforts to further reduce substance use in this population.
