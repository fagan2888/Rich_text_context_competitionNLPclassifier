Introduction
Animal-assisted activities (AAAs) have been applied for
more than 40 years in patients with different psychological
and physical disorders. In AAA, the bond between humans
and animals is used as an integral part of a patient's treat-
ment. AAA in health care involves a variety of species like
dogs, cats, horses, and domesticated birds. Despite their
increasing application in a wide range of therapeutic ser-
vices, the empirical evidence base ofAAAs is limited (Beetz,
Uvnas-Moberg, Julius, & Kotrschal, 2012; Munoz Lasa
et al., 2015). There are only few randomized studies which
have investigated the effect of AAA, as listed in Table 1
(Borgi et al., 2016; Calcaterra et al., 2015; Cole, Gawlinski,
Steers, & Kotlerman, 2007; Friedmann et al., 2015; Harper
et al., 2015; Ko, Youn, Kim, & Kim, 2015; Majic, Gutzmann,
Heinz, Lang, & Rapp, 2013; Menna, Santaniello, Gerardi, Di
Maggio, & Milan, 2015; Nurenberg et al., 2015; Vagnoli
et al., 2015; Wohlfarth, Mutschler, Beetz, Kreuser, &
Korsten-Reck, 2013). Most of these studies were carried out
in patients with psychiatric disorders.
However, patients with cardiovascular disorders may also
benefit from AAA. AAA use in cardiovascular disease has
been previously reported only from hospitalized patients. In
one study of patients with advanced heart failure, a 12-min
hospital visit with a therapy dog improved hemodynamic
parameters, neurohormone levels, and anxiety (Cole et al.,
2007). In a further study of 69 patients, canine-assisted
ambulation was a safe and effective adjunct to an early
ambulation program for hospitalized heart failure patients
(Abate, Zucconi, & Boxer, 2011). It is unknown, however,
whether these beneficial effects persist during a long-term
follow-up period after hospital discharge.
It has been observed that physiological variables such as
cardiac autonomic activity change during short-term interac-
tions with animals and are positively influenced by pet-
ownership (Abate et al., 2011; Aiba et al., 2012). Registration

Feasibility of Home-Use Animal-Assisted
Activities in Patients With Implanted
Cardiac Electronic Devices: A Pilot Study

Christian Wegner3, and Claudia Stöllberger1
Abstract
Animal-assisted activities (AAAs) are mainly carried out in institutions. The aim of this prospective pilot study was to assess
the willingness of patients with cardiac implanted electronic devices (IEDs) to participate in AAA. The sample included
75 ambulatory patients (18 females, M age = 69 years), who attended an outpatient clinic for control of antibradycardic
pacemakers (n = 15) or implanted cardioverter defibrillators (n = 60). Twenty-three percent were current and 48% were
previous pet-owners. Current pet-owners were younger than non-pet-owners (63.5 vs. 72.0 years, p = .0003). Twelve
patients (16%) showed interest in AAA visits. However, only two patients agreed to an AAA visit. Both patients were
visited once, but declined further visits. Hence, AAA sessions at home were poorly accepted, mainly because the patients
considered themselves too busy or healthy, or due to a general disinterest in AAA. Potential health benefits associated with
AAA may not be feasible to investigate during home visits of AAA-teams in patients with IEDs who are healthy enough to
leave their homes. For further studies concerning AAA in patients with cardiovascular diseases, we suggest focusing on
institutions like rehabilitation centers or day care centers and on more severely sick, homebound patients.

of parameters of cardiac autonomic activity requires monitor-
ing devices which have to be carried by the patient and, thus,
might induce stress and inconvenience (Lobodzinski & Laks,
2012). Parameters of cardiac autonomic activity are also regis-
tered by modern implanted electronic devices (IED) like pace-
makers or cardiac defibrillators and can be measured by device
interrogation. Potential benefits of AAA on cardiac autonomic
activity could be ideally studied in patients with IED.
So far, AAA has been carried out mainly in institutions,
such as nursing homes; rehabilitation units; psychiatric, sur-
gical, or orthopedic departments of hospitals; or prisons
(Abate et al., 2011; Aiba et al., 2012; Beetz et al., 2012; Borgi
et al., 2016; Calcaterra et al., 2015; Cole et al., 2007;
Friedmann et al., 2015; Harper et al., 2015; Harris, Rinehart,
& Gerstman, 1993; Ko et al., 2015; Majic et al., 2013; Menna
et al., 2015; Munoz Lasa et al., 2015; Nurenberg et al., 2015;
Vagnoli et al., 2015; Wohlfarth et al., 2013). Home visits for
AAA are unusual in Europe; however, they are an offered ser-
vice in the United States for homebound patients and are
appreciated by patients who are too sick to leave their homes
by themselves (Harris et al., 1993). It is unknown if ambula-
tory outpatients with cardiovascular disorders would be inter-
ested to be visited by AAA-teams in their homes. The aim of
this prospective pilot study was to assess the willingness of
patients with IEDs to participate in AAA home sessions.
Method
The study is a prospective, single arm, observational study.
Subjects included were consecutive outpatients with IEDs
who were scheduled for an appointment in the outpatient
clinic for control of their IED between November 2012 and
March 2013 in a cardiological outpatient clinic of a 900-bed
community hospital in the center of a large city.
Step 1: In the waiting area of the outpatient clinic, pam-
phlets were displayed about AAA aimed to inform the
patients.
Step 2: The study physician (P.J. or D.G.) approached the
patient in the waiting area, introduced himself as study
physician and informed the patient about AAA referring
to the pamphlet.
Step 3: If the patient showed interest, the patient was
interviewed by the study physician about current and pre-
vious pet-ownership according to a preset questionnaire.
The subjects were offered AAA free of any charge. They
could choose being visited at home or to meet with the
therapy team in the outpatient clinic and between a dog
and a cat as therapy animals. The potential health benefits
of regular AAA-visits over the course of the study were
identified. Finally, patients were asked whether they were
interested in visits ofAAA-teams, and those who were not
interested were asked to explain precisely why.
Step 4: In case they were interested, physicians explained
to them the study procedures, the opportunities, aims,
and potential benefits. The patients had to fill in a ques-
tionnaire about their former experiences with animals.
In addition, the following demographic and clinical data
were documented: age, gender, type of IED, and current
and previous pet-ownership. All these recruitments were

done in the waiting room. The cardiologist responsible
for the clinical examination and check-up of each
patient's IED was not involved in the study. This person
was informed of the activity of the study physician in the
waiting area, but did not interfere with or influence
patients' decisions regarding their possible participation
in AAA.
Step 5: After initial contact, the patients were approached
by telephone within 1 week by a certified AAA-team to
arrange an appointment. Informal records, without the use
of a specific pro forma, were made of patients' reactions
to the telephone call.
The AAA-teams considered the following activities
which they typically carry out according to the preferences
of the patients: encouraging patients to pet the dog, brush the
coat, throw a ball, give treats, let the dog perform some feats,
or talk about the patient's experience with pets. As the pur-
pose of the pilot study was to determine feasibility of the
AAA home visits, the activities during the AAA-visits were
not specifically planned in advance, and no preset protocol
forms for documentation of the activities was developed.
The agreed procedure included writing an informal report
about each visit. If a current pet-owner expressed an interest
in an AAA visit, the procedure included the plan of an indi-
vidual approach by theAAA-team to avoid conflicts between
the visiting therapy animal and the resident pet.
The AAA-teams consisted of specially trained and certi-
fied therapy dogs and their handlers, being members of the
organization "Tiere als Therapie" (Animals for Therapy), an
ESAAT (European Society for Animal-Assisted Therapy)
member association with high quality standards and long
experience in AAA (http://www.en.esaat.org/). The require-
ments for the therapy animals of this organization are as fol-
lows: excellent health status with a health certificate renewed
every year by a veterinarian, free of any pain, good-tempered
character, free of any parasites and precautions against para-
sites, and completely vaccinated. Furthermore, therapy ani-
mals are trained using positive reinforcement techniques to
be stress-resistant and relaxed with regard to contact with
new situations, children, and other animals and stress-resis-
tant with regard to unknown sounds, movements, and optical
stimuli. An annual evaluation of the therapy animal's behav-
ior and the AAA-team performance is carried out to ensure
best working practice.
For statistical analysis, differences among categories
were tested by applying Fisher's test for categorical vari-
ables and by t test for continuous variables. The analysis
was conducted by the statistical software R (R Core Team,
2014).
The study was ethically approved by the institutional
review board of the Wiener Krankenanstaltenverbund in
Vienna, and oral informed consent was obtained from all
included patients for the interview in the waiting area.
Results
Step 1: Overall, 120 patients were asked to participate in
the interview in the waiting area.
Step 2: Twenty of these 120 patients declined the inter-
view because of the following reasons: no interest in the
interview (n = 8), language barriers (n = 7), and hardness
of hearing (n = 5).
Step 3: The remaining 100 patients were interviewed;
however, 25 of them were excluded because they had no
IED. Thus, 75 patients, 57 males and 18 females, with a
mean age of 69 years (range = 42-91) were included in the
analysis. Fifteen patients had antibradycardic pacemakers
(PM), 44 had implanted cardioverter defibrillators (ICD),
14 had an ICD combined with a cardiac resynchronization
device (CRT-D), and two patients had a PM combined
with an ICD. All 75 patients were ambulatory, none of
them were wheelchair-bond or in need for assistance to
attend the outpatient clinic.
Six of the 75 patients did not provide information about
previous or current pet-ownership. From the remaining 69
patients, the following information about pet-ownership was
provided: Sixteen of the patients (23%) were current pet-
owners (dog: n = 6, cat: n = 4, dog and cat: n = 4, hamster:
n = 1, bees: n = 1). The mean age of the 16 current pet-owners
was lower than that of the 53 current non-pet-owners (63.5
vs. 72.0 years, p = .003). Of the 53 current non-pet-owners,
33 patients reported previous pet-ownership (dog: n = 19,
cat: n = 7, dog and cat: n = 5, hamster: n = 2). The clinical
characteristics of the 49 former and current pet-owners did
not differ from the 20 patients who were never pet-owners,
as listed in Table 2.
Step 4: Twelve of the included 75 patients (16%) were
initially interested in receiving AAA during home visits.
None of the patients were interested in meeting with the
AAA-team in the outpatient clinic. Ten of these 12 were
previous pet-owners and only two had never had a pet
(p = .0553). Their clinical characteristics were not differ-
ent from those of the 63 patients who were not interested
in AAA. The following reasons were given by the 63
patients who were not interested in AAA: no interest at all
(n = 19), too busy (n = 13), current pet-ownership (n = 11),
living outside of Vienna (n = 6), aversion to animals (n = 3),
no trust inAAA(n = 4), language problems (n = 3), refusal
to speak (n = 2), scheduled surgery (n = 1), and mental
illness (n = 1).
Step 5: Of the 12 patients who were initially interested,
only two agreed to a visit of an AAA-team in their homes.
The AAA-teams reported that during the visits, both
patients were engaged. One patient was not interested in
AAA but was happy to have someone to talk to. He did
not show any interest in the dog and considered himself
inappropriate for AAA. Therefore, no further visits were
4 SAGE Open
carried out. The second patient, a previous dog owner,
was interested in the dog, enjoyed, and was engaged in the
visit but still did not want a continuation of the visits
because he did not expect any benefit for his situation.
The remaining 10 patients, who were initially interested,
refused a visit due to the following reasons: one patient's
wife was hospitalized, therefore, AAA would have been too
much stress for him. Another had too many appointments
and no time for AAA, while a further patient was afraid that
the dog could harm her dialysis shunt. One patient from the
group felt too healthy for any therapy, two had lost interest in
AAA, and one was hospitalized and subsequently died. Two
patients could not be contacted by telephone, and one could
not remember that he had claimed interest in AAA.
Overall, the results of this pilot study showed that 23% of
patients with IEDs were current pet-owners, 48% previous
pet-owners, and 29% have never owned a pet. Pet-owners
with IEDs were younger than non-pet-owners. Only 16% of
patients with IEDs expressed an interest in visits of AAA-
teams in homes, while only two patients agreed to a visit.
While only two patients (2.6%) were visited, both patients
declined continuation of AAA. Thus, it seems that AAA-
visits in their homes were not valued by patients with IEDs,
although a high proportion of them were previous or current
pet-owners.
Discussion
The low rate of interest forAAAmay be due to the fact that the
included patients considered themselves as relatively healthy,
thus avoiding any additional contact with the hospital. This
assumption is substantiated by the finding that none of the
patients wanted AAA-team visits in the outpatient clinic.
Surprisingly, although 12 patients were interested in and
consented to home visits, in only two cases were visits actu-
ally completed. It is possible that patients were fearful of
jeopardizing their care by saying no, even if the physician
was not objectively coercive in any way and the physician,
who explained the study, was not the care provider. A further
factor may be the lack of a specific protocol or script for the
telephone call making the visit appointment. It is therefore
not possible to be sure that each patient received exactly the
same information over the phone.
It remains unclear if outpatients with cardiovascular dis-
orders are willing to accept visits of AAA-teams in their
homes. The results of our pilot study suggest a low rate of
acceptance due to various reasons, mainly because the
patients consider themselves as too busy or healthy, or are
not interested in AAA. As home settings differ from institu-
tions in patients' degree of control, privacy, and how time is
spent, patients' estimation of AAA might differ between
these settings (Harris et al., 1993). Patients may prefer not to
have "guest pets" in their homes.
Based on these experiences with this subset of outpatients
with IEDs, it has to be investigated whether AAA in another
setting, outside the patients' homes, would be more accepted
or whetherAAA-team visits in patients'homes with advanced
stages of heart failure would be an option. For further studies
concerning AAA in patients with cardiovascular diseases, we
suggest focusing on institutions like rehabilitation centers or
day care centers. Furthermore, the monitoring function of
IEDs could be used to assess the influence of animal­human
interaction on parameters of cardiac autonomic activity in
interested patients, pet-owners as well as non-pet-owners,
with IEDs. Care has to be taken to define a protocol for infor-
mation transmitted by phone between AAA-teams and
patients to avoid misunderstandings.
Limitations of the study are the low number of patients
and the absence of any assessment of psychiatric comorbidi-
ties like depression or anxiety, which could have had an
impact on the very low interest in AAA. Furthermore,
degrees of sickness and functional disability were not
assessed. Information on the ethnic and religious background
of the patients was not gathered, meaning that any possible
relationships between these factors and interest in AAA
could not be assessed.
Our findings suggest that the previously reported benefits
of AAA in ambulatory outpatients with cardiovascular disor-
ders may not be feasible to investigate during home visits of
outpatients with IEDs by AAA-teams. More studies with
patients across the range of cardiac illness severity are needed.
