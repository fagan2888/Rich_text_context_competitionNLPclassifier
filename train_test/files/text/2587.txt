ABSTRACT
Background: The associations between early life-socioeconomic status and health, specifically
substance use, are well substantiated. The vulnerabilities associated with adversity in childhood,
particularly poverty, can have a cumulative effect on an individual's risk and resilience throughout
the life course. While several studies substantiate the relationship between substance use and
welfare participation, less known is the impact of and prevalence of behavioral health problems
later in life among young adults who were welfare recipients before age 18. Objective: This article
explores whether childhood welfare participation before the age of 18 years influences substance
use until young adulthood (24­34 years). Methods: This study used Add Health data with sample
sizes ranging from 12,042 to 12,324 respondents, and propensity score matching methods to
balance the samples and account for selection bias. Matched data were then used to run a series
of regression models. Results: Those who participated in welfare before the age of 18 years had a
significant lower probability of remaining substance-free until young adulthood (marijuana-free
by 30%, p < 0.001; and other illicit substances-free by 16%, p < 0.05). However, no significant
between-group differences were found on any of the alcohol-related variables. Conclusions:
Findings highlight long-term behavioral health risks, especially substance use, faced by young
adults who participated in welfare before the age of 18 years. Acknowledging the vulnerabilities
associated with welfare participation and living in poverty could help increase the effectiveness of
program and treatment efforts. The prevention of long-term behavioral health disorders hinges
on early diagnosis and intervention.

Introduction
Childhood adversities such as poverty and socioeconomic
stress have been cited as important predictors of health
outcomes into adulthood (1­4) and can have a cumulative
effect on ones' risk and resilience (5). The associations
between early life-socioeconomic status and health, speci-
fically substance use, throughout the life course are well
documented (4,6­8). Several studies substantiate the rela-
tionship between substance use and welfare participation
(9­12). However, less known is the impact of and preva-
lence of behavioral health problems later in life among
children who were welfare recipients before age 18. Using
longitudinal data from the nationally representative Add
Health dataset, this study contributes to the literature by
exploring whether welfare participation before the age of 18
predicts substance use rates, and prevalence until young
adulthood, a period categorized broadly between 24 and 34
years of age (13,14).
In terms of substance use rates, youth and young adults
constitute the groups most likely to use alcohol or illicit
substances (15­17). Current estimates suggest 23 million
individuals in the United States, or 9% of the population 12
years and older, meet diagnostic criteria for a substance use
disorder (18,19). As 1996 welfare reform was debated,
estimates ranged dramatically from 6% to 37% of welfare
recipients who had a substance use problem (20). However,
these data are for adult welfare recipients only and to date,
there are no comparable data of substance use rates later in
the life course for children and adolescents who received
Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), or
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits
before age 18. Additionally, the discrepancy in the wide
range is due to different data sources, definitions, metho-
dology, and thresholds for substance use over different
increments of time. In order to understand the influence
of childhood welfare participation on adulthood substance
use, the social safety net of welfare assistance warrants
further attention.

Reconciliation Act of 1996 (also commonly referred to
as "welfare reform"), was signed by President Clinton
and is considered to be a main safety-net welfare pro-
gram for children and families delivered through fed-
eral block grants for states to administer (21). Under
TANF, substantial changes to welfare include a max-
imum 5-year lifetime limit of benefits, work (or in
some states, school) requirements, and more state dis-
cretion on how benefits can be administered or sanc-
tioned (1,22,23). As a result of welfare reform, caseloads
have been reduced from 5 million families in 1993 to
3.94 million in 1997, and to 1.95 million in 2011 (23­
25). While these numbers reflect lower rates of partici-
pation in welfare overall, a more nuanced understand-
ing recognizes that declining caseloads resulted from
stricter eligibility requirements and not due to poverty
alleviation (1,22). Further, stigma associated with wel-
fare participation has been documented and connected
to welfare participation rates historically (26,27).
Precisely because studies have shown that those who
experience chronic childhood adversity, such as socio-
economic disadvantage, have a greater likelihood of
substance use disorder and an increased risk for
chronic adversity (6,28­30), the impact of childhood
welfare participation on substance use later in life war-
rants further attention. Specifically, childhood poverty
has been linked to a host of physical and psychological
disorders during childhood and later in life (4,28)
including social adjustment (31); disadvantaged neigh-
borhood conditions (32); educational achievement
(33,34); housing mobility, economic capital, and self-
sufficiency (34,35); and obesity rates (36,37). However,
given the heightened vulnerabilities of children experi-
encing poverty and participation in means-tested wel-
fare programs, the literature remains surprisingly
nascent on the impact of receiving welfare in the early
part of the life course (<18 years old) and rates of
substance use in adulthood. To fill this gap, this study
attempts to connect adversities in childhood, such as
poverty and as indicated by welfare participation before
the age of 18 with adult substance use.
Methods
Data
This study used survey data from the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health
(Add Health). Add Health is a longitudinal study of
nationally representative cohort survey of grades 7­12
students of 1994­1995 academic year conducted by the
Carolina Population Center at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. Participants were followed into
young adulthood (ages 24­34 at Wave IV; 13) with four
waves of in-home interviews (Wave I, 1995, N = 20,745
to Wave IV, 2008­2009, N = 15,701), yielding rich data
that tracked participants' social, economic, psychologi-
cal, and physical well-being dimensions from childhood
to adulthood (see (38) for detailed information on the
Add Health survey design). In addition, this survey
collected parents' information at Wave I (N = 17,670).
For this article, we used the subpopulation of respon-
dents who finished both the Wave I and Wave IV
survey. We also included participants' family back-
ground and their parent's information to explore the
potential effects of welfare participation on substance
use. Our sample size started at 15,701 and reduced to
final analytic ranges of 12,042 to 12,324 for several
reasons including: roughly 15% of adolescents had par-
ents who did not finish the interview at Wave IV, and
Wave IV sampling weights had 901 missing values,
including the dependent variables.
Measures
Dependent variables
For this study, the substance use dependent variables
included six dimensions of alcohol use and five cate-
gories of drug use of adults in Wave IV.
Alcohol use
The Add Health survey defined "a drink" as "a glass of
wine, a can or bottle of beer, a wine cooler, a shot glass
of liquor, or a mixed drink, not just sips or tastes from
someone else's drink." To yield a better understanding
and more precise measure of alcohol use, participants
were asked to recall six dimensions of their alcohol use
for both long-term (during the past 12 months) and
short-term periods (past 30 days). For longer-term alco-
hol use, participants were asked: (a) "how many days
they drank alcohol". Seven response categories were
provided: 0 = None, 1 = 1 or 2 days a year, 2 = once
a month or less (3­12 days) a year, 3 = 2 or 3 days a
month, 4 = 1 or 2 days a week, 5 = 3­5 days a week,
and 6 = (almost) every day; (b) participants were asked
"Think of all the times you have had a drink. How
many drinks did you usually have each time?"
Responses ranged from 0 to 18 drinks; (c) participants
were asked "how many days did you drink (5 or more/4
or more) drinks in a row?" Response options were the
same as the first dimension range from 0 to 6; and (d)
participants were asked to report how many days did
they get drunk or very high on alcohol, also using the
same seven responses as the first dimension. Short-term
use was categorized as drinking during the past 30 days:
(e) participants were asked how many days they drank,
2 S. WU ET AL.
using the same responses from 0 to 6 as the first
dimension; and (f) participants were asked "Think of
all the times you have had a drink during the past 30
days. How many drinks did you usually have each
time?" Responses range from 0 to 18 drinks.
Substance use
At the Wave IV data collection, the Add Health survey
asked participants whether they had ever used the follow-
ing drugs before the Wave IV survey time point: (a)
steroids, including anabolic steroids or body-building
drugs; (b) marijuana, including hashish, bhang, and
ganja; (c) cocaine, including crack and coca leaves; (d)
crystal meth, also known as ice, crank, or tweak; and (e)
other types of illicit drugs, such as lysergic acid diethyla-
mide (LSD), phencyclidine (PCP), ecstasy, heroin, psilo-
cybin mushrooms, or intoxicative inhalants. These
questions used dichotomous responses, with yes coded
as 1 and no coded as 0. Notably, the Wave IV Add Health
survey did not ask young adult respondents about their
current use of all these five types of substances. Given this
limitation of the data, our analysis could not include an
explicit measure of substance use during adult years only.
However, a response of no indicated that the respondent
had never used illicit substances at least until young
adulthood. Therefore, we created the five variables indi-
cating no use of a particular substance before the Wave IV
survey time point: steroid-free, marijuana-free, cocaine-
free, crystal meth-free, and free of other types of illicit
drug use (1 = never used; 0 = previously used).
Table 1 presents the distributions of each dependent
variable. For participants' alcohol use, in past 12 months,
the average number of days when alcohol was consumed
was 2.29 (SD = 1.8), with 2.72 (SD = 2.99) being the
average number of alcoholic drinks consumed at each
episode. Table 1 also offers alcohol use variables pre-
sented in the past 30 days. As for rates of drug use, more
than half of the respondents (55%) reported previous use
of marijuana, followed by other illicit substances (22%),
cocaine (19%), crystal meth (9%), and steroids (2%).
Although just over half of the sample had used mar-
ijuana before adulthood, 45% had not used marijuana,
and the vast majority of respondents reported no pre-
vious use of other illicit substances (78%), cocaine (81%),
crystal meth (91%), and steroids (98%).
Key independent variable
Our aim was to explore whether a household's receipt
of public welfare assistance before a child was 18 years
old had an impact on substance use once the respon-
dent reached young adulthood. To answer this ques-
tion, we divided participants into two groups based on
responses to the question: "Before you were 18 years
old, did anyone in your household ever receive public
assistance, welfare payments, or Food Stamps?"
Responses to the questions were based on data from
Wave III (aged from 18 to 26); for participants missing
Wave III data, responses were based on Wave IV data.
Overall, about 18% of participants were from a welfare
recipient family.
Covariates
We controlled for demographic and socioeconomic vari-
ables at individual, parental, household, and community
levels on all the analytic models identified in the literature.
At the individual level from Wave I, we controlled for
adults' gender (1 = female; 0 = male), age (as a continuous
variable), and race. Race was recoded as five dummy
variables: white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native
American and others. Self-perceived intelligence was
assessed by asking adults "compared to other people in
your age, how intelligent are you?" Responses ranged
from 1 to 6, denoting "moderately below average" to
"extremely above average". We also controlled for adults'
personal income level from Wave IV, which was recoded
as three dummy variables: low income (<$10,000), mod-
erate income ($10,000­$ 99,999), and high income (>
$99,999). Educational level from Wave IV was recoded

as four dummy variables: high school graduate or less,
some colleges, college graduate, and some graduate school
and above. Marriage status from Wave IV was coded as a
dummy variable (1 = married or cohabitating; 0 = other).
We controlled for adults' parental education,
employment status, and health status from Wave I.
Parental education ranges were scored from 0 (less
than 8th grade) to 7 (professional training after col-
lege). Employment status was coded as four dummy
variables: unemployed and not looking for a job, unem-
ployed and is looking for a job, part-time employed,
and full-time employed. Parental health status was
recoded as three dummy variables: good, fair, and
poor. In addition, we controlled whether respondent's
family had enough money to pay their bills (1 = yes; 0 =
no). Family structure was measured as four dummy
variables: two biological parents, two parents' one bio-
logical; single parent, and other, and household size
(number of persons living in the household) from
Wave I.
For all of the five drug use outcomes, we addition-
ally controlled for whether participants' assessed drug
use as a problem within their neighborhood to gauge
their normative beliefs regarding drug use. This was
recoded as three dummy variables that substance use
was perceived as: not a problem, a small problem, and
big problem; we also controlled for whether partici-
pants had learned about drug use in a class at school
(1 = yes; 0 = no). For all the six alcohol use outcomes,
we controlled for parental alcohol use (recoded as
three dummy variables: never, sometimes, and more
than 3 days a week), and whether participants had
learned about issues of drinking in a class at school
(1 = yes; 0 = no).
Analytical strategies
First, we conducted descriptive analysis to capture the
overall distributions for all of the variables. Then, to
investigate whether young adults whose family had ever
received welfare benefits before 18 years had impact on
their adulthood substance use, given the non-randomi-
zation design of this study, we conducted propensity
score matching so that the two groups (received welfare
vs. not received welfare) were comparable. By conduct-
ing these analytic steps, the sample selection bias could
be reduced (39,40).
To conduct propensity score full matching, first, we
used logistic regression to predict each participant's
probability (i.e., propensity score) of living in a family
that received welfare benefits before 18 years based on
all the covariates that were introduced previously.
Second, we matched each adult who grew up in a
welfare recipient family with someone who did not
grow up in a welfare recipient family but had the
closest propensity scores. We used 0.01 as the caliper
for the matching (39). We limited our matching in a
common support region with overlapped propensity
scores, and did balance checks on all the control vari-
ables before and after matching to ensure the match-
ing process was conducted appropriately. Tables 2 and
3 show that most of the covariates did not balance
before matching, whereas those imbalanced variables
were all balanced after matching. The adequate bal-
ance after matching indicates that the adults who grew
up in a welfare recipient family are very similar to
their counterparts who did not grow up in a welfare
recipient family.
Finally, we conducted regression models (logistic
regression for the five drug use models, whereas OLS
regression for the six alcohol use models) to examine
the association between the key independent variable
and each of the outcome variables, while controlling for
the demographic and socioeconomic factors at the indi-
vidual, parental, household, and community levels. All
of the analysis was conducted by using Stata 13.1 for
Windows. Based on Chen and Chantala's suggestion
(41), we used survey command with sampling weights
for the analyses, which can adjust the complexity sur-
vey design (unequal probability and clustering selec-
tion) of Add Health, and yield national population
estimates for selection bias.
Results
The results of our analysis on the effects of welfare
participation before 18 years on six dimensions of the
alcohol use are shown in Table 4. Overall, young adults
(24­34 years old) raised in a household that ever
received welfare had lower levels of alcohol use as
adults when compared with adults who did not parti-
cipate in welfare during childhood. Although between-
group differences were found among the six dimen-
sions of alcohol use, none reached statistical signifi-
cance at the 0.05 level.
Effect of childhood welfare participation on drug
use
As shown in Table 5, we found that, as compared with
counterparts whose families had never received welfare,
young adults whose families received welfare before the
age of 18 had a 30% lower probability of remaining
marijuana-free until young adulthood (OR = 0.702, p <
0.001). Similarly, young adults with childhood welfare
experience before the age of 18 had a 16% lower

probability of remaining free of use of other illicit
substances (OR = 0.844, p < 0.05) until young adult-
hood. However, childhood welfare participation had no
statistically significant effect on the probability of
remaining cocaine-free, steroid-free, and crystal meth-
free until young adulthood.
Column (b) of Table 5 shows that in comparison
with counterparts with no welfare experience, the prob-
ability of a person with welfare experience in childhood
remaining marijuana-free until young adulthood was
affected by other factors, including having parents with
higher education (OR = 0.901, p < 0.001), parents with
full-time jobs (OR = 0.731, p < 0.01), and parents with
good health status (OR = 0.667, p < 0.001). A statisti-
cally significant lower probability of remaining mari-
juana-free was also associated with household-level
covariates, including young adults from a single-parent
family (OR = 0.812, p < 0.05), and adults living in
neighborhoods recognized as having a low level of
drug use (OR = 0.786, p < 0.01). For the covariates at
the young adult level, higher probability of remaining
marijuana-free until young adulthood was found for
females (OR = 1.513, p < 0.001), Hispanics (OR =
1.466, p < 0.01), blacks (OR = 2.082, p < 0.001), and
young adults with education at the graduate school
level or above (OR = 1.402, p < 0.001). In addition,
for every one year increase in age, the probability of
remaining marijuana-free until young adulthood
increased by 15% (p < 0.001).
Column (e) of Table 5 shows that in comparison
with counterparts with no welfare experience, the prob-
ability of a person with welfare experience in childhood
remaining free of use of other illicit substances until
young adulthood was affected by other factors, includ-
ing having parents with higher education (OR = 0.915,
p < 0.01), parents with full-time jobs (OR = 0.518, p <
0.001), and parents with part-time jobs (OR = 0.606,
p < 0.01). A statistically significant lower probability of
remaining free of use of other illicit substances was also
associated with household-level covariates, including
young adults from a single-parent family (OR = 0.745,
p < 0.05), young adults from two parents with only one
biological parent (OR = 0.684, p < 0.01), and adults
living in neighborhoods recognized as having a low
level of drug use (OR = 0.802, p < 0.05). For the
covariates at the young adult level, higher probability
of remaining free of use of other illicit substances until
young adulthood was found for females (OR = 1.105, p <
0.001), Hispanics (OR = 1.466, p < 0.05), blacks
(OR = 5.667, p < 0.001), young adults with a high
income level (OR = 1.848, p < 0.05), with education at
the graduate school level or above (OR = 1.818, p <
0.01), and for those who were married or cohabitating
(OR = 1.413, p < 0.01). In addition, for every one year
increase in age, the probability of remaining marijuana-
free until young adulthood increased by 11% (p < 0.001).
Discussion
Behavioral health problems among welfare recipients
have become important themes in the broader public
discourse about welfare reform and new policies to
drug-test welfare participants (11). Establishing the
rates of substance use problems among welfare recipi-
ents has been important for prevention and targeted
treatment among this population (9, 12). Findings of
this study highlight long-term behavioral health risks of
young adults whose families participate in welfare pro-
grams before the age of 18. This population focus is
important given the developmental tasks associated
with emerging and young adulthood that can impact
physical health, behavioral health, and social develop-
ment, as well as participation in community and
employment contexts (42).
The web of factors impacting substance use are
multifaceted and complex and include environmental,
interpersonal, social, and individual level risks (43).
This study draws attention to various risk and protec-
tive factors that impact substance use into adulthood
among adults who before the age of 18 participated in
welfare. Participation in welfare is one casual mechan-
ism that impacts rates of illicit drug use as one ages.
However, equally important are the protective factors
that reduce the likelihood of engaging in substance use,
despite the known risks of poverty on human develop-
ment and subsequent health outcomes. Across the con-
tinuum from policy makers developing programs to
assist families living in poverty to those on the ground
implementing programs and services, families impacted
by poverty are at increased risk for adverse circum-
stances (44). These adversities last beyond childhood
and have impact on human development throughout
the life course. Family structure, neighborhood safety,
educational attainment, and gender differences warrant
additional focus especially as the impact of welfare
participation before age 18 is further understood.
Interestingly, there were no significant differences
between any of the alcohol use variables and welfare
participation before the age of 18. While Keyes et al.'s
(45) work underscores the importance of social context
THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE 11
and social norms in how alcohol use impacts popula-
tion level determinants of the population's alcohol use,
it is possible that these factors were not sufficiently
controlled for within this study. Ample research exists
to confirm that alcohol outlets are concentrated in
minority and low-wealth communities (46­49), and
may impact community level norms and attitude con-
cerning alcohol. Cultural norms and values have a
powerful influence on alcohol-related behaviors, as
well as on belief systems about use (50) indicating
that more research is warranted around these norms
and later alcohol use among welfare recipients
specifically.
The prevention of long-term negative outcomes,
including the development of behavioral health disor-
ders, hinges on early diagnosis and intervention. In
order to reach more children, adults, and families
impacted by poverty and potential substance use, addi-
tional focus on the prevention of behavioral health
problems is crucial. This includes "effective programs
to scale at the school, neighborhood and community
level" (43, p. 245) in addition to a clear understanding
of the intersection between adverse social conditions
and the social policies in place to remedy them. With
the passage of the Affordable Care Act and a move
toward integrated systems of care, there is a renewed
emphasis on the screening, prevention, and early inter-
vention for behavioral health problems; this new
approach can have great benefit, particularly for those
experiencing poverty early on in the life-course and
among recipients of welfare programs.
This study has several strengths: first, this study used
a nationally representative large sample size data from
Add Health, which allowed us to more broadly general-
ize study conclusions. Second, this study used several
measures of substance use (i.e., five dimensions for
drug use and six dimensions for alcohol use) to yield
a better understanding of the type and severity of sub-
stance use and also to show the impacts of household
welfare participation on participants' substance use
later on in the life course. Third, this study used pro-
pensity score matching method to reduce the sample
selection bias, and could yield more precisely results, as
compared with running regressions on unmatched
samples. This study can significantly enhance the cur-
rent literature and fill the research gap of exploring the
relationship between childhood welfare participation
and adulthood substance use.
Despite these strengths, several limitations need to
be acknowledged: first, Add Health survey used a
school-based sampling approach, which excluded
adolescents who were not in school for a variety of
reasons. Second, given the consideration of the
complicated survey design (i.e., needs to use survey
commend with weights), we lost a large amount of
the original sample size due to missing data. For
future studies, using multiple imputation could be a
robust method for dealing with missing data, rather
than just deleting the cases as was done in this ana-
lysis (51). Third, given the limitation of the Wave IV
Add Health data, our analysis could not include an
explicit measure of drug use during adult years only.
Therefore, instead of looking at the adulthood drug
use, we examined the impacts of childhood welfare
participation on probability of remaining drug-free
until young adulthood. Lastly, although this study
used propensity score analysis to control the selection
bias for the effects of household welfare participant
and several other influential variables on adulthood
substance use, this statistical methodology cannot
conclusively rule out the unmeasured or unobserved
variables that may be crucial to the "treatment"
effects. A randomized experiment in which both
observed and unobserved predictors are balanced
would be an ideal approach.
Further research is needed to capture a more
nuanced analysis that includes variables to assess the
depth and context of childhood adversity and poverty
and the impact on later life behavioral health issues.
This includes the length and duration of welfare parti-
cipation in childhood given the adversities of poverty
can differ based on pervasiveness and when in child
development they occur (1). Precisely because "perso-
nal responsibility" and "work" were the key focus of
1996 welfare reform, and employability continues to be
an important barometer for contributing to society
(11), the impact of welfare participation warrants
close consideration for the long-term behavioral health
and well-being of program participants.
