Introduction: To better understand, and ultimately prevent, infant/child homicide, it is imperative to more
thoroughly elucidate the circumstances and conditions related to such instances. Data were obtained from
the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) to illuminate circumstances related to homicide
among children aged 4 years or less, and to identify demographic groups which may be at increased risk.
Methods: The NVDRS is an active surveillance system that provides comprehensive information on all
violent deaths that occur within participating states within the US. Standard statistical tests were conducted
to determine homicide rates among children ages 0­4 across states that provided data for both 2003 and
2004 (Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia). These data
were further used to investigate infant/child homicides by race, gender, and other relevant circumstances
(for example, victim-suspect relationship, weapon type, and location of homicide). A Poisson regression
model was fitted to the sample data to investigate the multivariate relationship between the infant/child
homicide rate and available demographic information.
Results: The 2003 homicide rate for children ages 0­4 was 3.0 per 100 000 population. The 2004
homicide rate was 2.5 per 100 000 population. African Americans were 4.2 times as likely as whites to
be victims of homicide. Suspects were commonly parents/caregivers. The vast majority of infant/child
homicides occurred in houses or apartments, using weapons that include household objects.
Conclusion: Homicides of infants and young children are most often committed in the home, by parents/
caregivers, using ``weapons of opportunity''. This suggests that the risk of infant/child homicide is greatest
within the primary care giving environment. Moreover, the use of ``weapons of opportunity'' may be
indicative of maladaptive stress responses. Prevention and intervention strategies to reduce infant/child
homicide should target the home environment and attend to maladaptive stress responses.
Homicide is the leading cause of infant deaths due to
intentional injury in the US.1 2 In 2003, there were 717
reported homicides of children between zero and four
years of age.1 3 4 The risk for homicide is greater in infancy than
in any other year of childhood before the age of 15 years.3
Prior research suggests that the vast majority of perpe-
trators of infant/child homicide are female, most often the
mother.2 3 As such, certain maternal characteristics have been
cited as well established risk factors for infant/child
homicide: age 19 or younger; single marital status; 12 or
fewer years of education; previous births; and late initiation
of prenatal care.3 5­7 Further, infant characteristics associated
with infant homicide include low birth weight, low gesta-
tional age, low Apgar scores, and male sex.8­10
Using data obtained from the National Violent Death
Reporting System (NVDRS), the current study explores the
circumstances and characteristics of homicide among chil-
dren aged four years or less.
METHODS
The NVDRS
The NVDRS is an active state based surveillance system that
provides comprehensive information on all violent deaths
within participating states within the US. Seven states
(Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon,
South Carolina, and Virginia) provided data to the NVDRS
in 2003. Six additional states (Colorado, Georgia, North
Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) provided
data to the NVDRS in 2004. In the current study, we report
only on the seven states that began providing data in 2003.
The NVDRS defines violent death as death resulting from
an intentional act (for example, poisoning) and/or the
intentional use of physical force or power against oneself or
another person. This includes homicides, suicides, and legal
intervention deaths. Unintentional firearm related deaths
and deaths of undetermined intent are also included in the
NVDRS. Legal executions and acts of war are excluded. The
primary data sources for the NVDRS are death certificates,
coroner/medical examiner records, police records, and crime
lab data. Secondary, optional data sources include child
fatality review team findings, supplementary homicide
reports, hospital records, emergency department data, and
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)
trace information on firearms. The NVDRS makes a unique
contribution to injury surveillance in that information on
circumstances related to suicide, undetermined deaths,
homicides, and unintentional firearm injuries are contained
in a single database.
Statistical methods
We determined the homicide rate among children aged four
years and under across participating states. In addition,
infant/child homicide rates were stratified by race, gender,
and other relevant circumstances and conditions (for
example, victim-suspect relationship, weapon type) to enable
examination of stratum specific variations in rates. Further,
we fit a Poisson regression model to investigate the multi-
variate relationship between the infant/child homicide rate
and available demographic information and to facilitate
simultaneous statistical adjustment for the effects of all
variables of interest. Denominator data were obtained from

the National Center for Health Statistics.11 We determined the
percentage of homicides with particular suspect-victim
relationships, weapons, and location of homicide. To incor-
porate into the estimation process an allowance for random
variability in the observations, 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were generated relative to all percentages and parameter
estimates. CIs for rates were calculated using asymptotic
methods.12 13
RESULTS
We report homicide rates, victim-suspect relationship,
weapons used in homicide, and location and timing of
homicides.
Homicide rates
During the two year period spanning 2003 and 2004 the
NVDRS recorded a total of 129 deaths of children aged four
years or less across the seven states that reported data in both
2003 and 2004. Seventy deaths occurred in 2003; the
remaining 59 deaths occurred in 2004 (see table 1). This
translates to 3.0 deaths per 100 000 population (95% CI 2.3 to
3.7) in 2003 and 2.5 deaths per 100 000 population (95% CI
1.9 to 3.2) in 2004. Overall, the infant/child homicide rates for
2003 and 2004 were not significantly different (p = 0.28).
In both 2003 and 2004, African Americans accounted for
51% of homicide victims age four years or less. As shown in
table 1, the rate per 100 000 population for African American
children in 2003 was 7.2 (95% CI 5.2 to 9.9) and 5.8 (95% CI
4.1 to 8.3) in 2004. The rates per 100 000 population for
males in 2003 was 3.5 (95% CI 2.6 to 4.7) and 2.2 (95% CI 1.5
to 3.2) in 2004. The corresponding rates for females were 2.4
(95% CI 1.7 to 3.5) in 2003 and 2.7 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.8) in
2004.
To investigate the multivariable relationship among homi-
cide rate and certain demographic characteristics, we fit a
Poisson regression model, with number of homicides as the
dependent variable and, as independent variables, year of
report (2003 (reference level), 2004), gender (male (reference
level), female), race (African American (reference level),
white, and other), and all two-way interactions. All multi-
variate analyses also accounted for state-specific variations in
infant homicide rates by treating state as a seven-level factor
in the Poisson regression models. We used backwards
stepwise regression to identify statistically significant vari-
ables.
In the multivariate model, only race and the factor
representing state-specific variations in infant homicide rates
remained after stepwise regression. Controlling for the effects
of other factors, African American infants were 4.2 times
(95% CI 2.9 to 6.0) times more likely be homicide victims
than white infants. Previous studies have found that male
gender is a risk factor. If we do not control for state, gender
effects are significant. State specific variation in homicide
might be a confounder of the association between gender and
homicide victimization.
Victim-suspect relationship
We also explored the victim-suspect relationships for
homicides of children aged four years or less by race and
gender for 2003­04. Parents and other caregivers were most
often the primary suspects, followed by family acquaintances
and friends. Parents and other caregivers were identified as
the primary suspect(s) in 52% of homicides involving African
American female infants and young children, and 49% of
homicides involving African American male infants and
young children. In comparison, parents were identified as the
primary suspect in 50% of homicides involving white male
infants and young children, and 39% of homicides involving
white female infants and young children (see table 2).
Moreover, the overall rate of homicides by parents/guardians
for 2003­04 was 3.3 per 100 000 population (95% CI 2.8 to
3.9).
While the percentage of homicides in which parents or
other caregivers were suspects was similar across most of the
comparison groups (white females were the exception,
displaying the only percentage that did not approach or
surpass 50%), comparisons of homicide rates did however
reveal that the risk of being killed by a parent or other
caregiver was greater for African Americans than for whites.
The risk of an African American male infant/child dying in a
homicide for which a parent or other caregiver was the
suspect was 3.4 times (95% CI 1.7 to 6.8) greater than the risk
for white males and 5.8 times greater than the risk for white
females (95% CI 2.6 to 13.1). The largest relative risks for
homicide by parent(s) were observed among African
American females. Compared to white males and females,
the risks of being killed in a homicide in which a parent or
other caregiver was suspect were 3.8 (95% CI 1.9 to 7.4) and
6.4 times (95% CI 2.8 to 14.3) greater for these children.
Family acquaintances and friends were also suspects in a
sizeable portion of homicide deaths among those aged 0­4
years. Family acquaintances and friends were identified as
suspects in 30% of homicide deaths involving white female
infants/children, and 28% of homicide deaths involving white
male infants/children. In comparison, family acquaintances
and friends were identified as suspects in 24% of homicides
involving African American female infants and young
children, and 12% of homicide deaths involving African
American male infants and young children.
We found no significant differences in the rates of
homicides in which acquaintances/friends were suspects for
African American male, white male, and white female
infants/children. However, our findings indicate that
African American females were 3.9 times more likely to die
in a homicide in which a family acquaintance/friend was a
suspect than were white females (95% CI 1.4 to 10.6) and 3.2
times more likely than white males (95% CI 1.2 to 8.2).
Weapon type
The NVDRS weapon-type categories include firearms, blunt
instruments (for example, club or bat), sharp instruments
(for example, knife, razor, broken glass, etc), poisoning,
hanging (including strangulation and suffocation), personal
weapons (for example, fist, feet, hands). Weapons not
corresponding to any of the aforementioned categories were
designated ``other.'' In 2003­04 ``other'' weapons constituted
the most common weapon type for homicide perpetration.
Weapons designated as ``other'' were cited in 32% of

homicides involving infants and young children 0­4 years of
age.
Overall, 16% of the infant/child homicides involved blunt
instruments. Within this particular weapon category, African
American male infants/children accounted for 21% of
homicide victims. African American females accounted for
18% of homicide victims in this weapon category. Twelve
percent of white males and 9% of white females were victims
of homicide via blunt instruments.
The relative risks for homicide using blunt instruments
show that African American male infants/children were 6.0
times more likely to be slain by blunt instruments than white
males (95% CI 1.8 to 20.5), and 11.4 times more likely than
white females (95% CI 2.4 to 55.0). For African American
females the risk of being slain by a blunt instrument was 5.0
times greater than the risk for their white female counter-
parts (95% CI 1.5 to 189) and 10.1 times greater than that for
white males (95% CI 2.0 to 50.2). We found no significant
differences in the rates of homicide via blunt instruments for
African American males and females.
Personal weapons were used in 16% of all infant/child
homicides. African American male infants/children
accounted for 18% of these homicide victims. White male
infants/children accounted for 16% of homicide victims via
personal weapons followed by white females who accounted
for 13% of homicide victims in this weapon category. Lastly,
African American female infants/children accounted for 12%
of homicide victims due to the use of personal weapons.
African American male infants/children were 4.1 times
more likely to be murdered with personal weapons than
white males (95% CI 1.2 to 13.4). Moreover, African
American male infants and young children were 6.5 times
more likely to suffer homicide victimization via personal
weapons than white females (95% CI 1.4 to 26.1). Similarly,
we found that the risk of being killed with a personal weapon
among African American female infants and young children
was 5.0 times greater than that of white females (95% CI 1.0
to 20.1). We observed no significant differences in terms of
the risks for homicide via personal weapons among African
American males and females, nor for African American
females when compared to white males.
Finally, NVDRS data indicate that firearms were used in
only 5% of the homicides of children aged four years and
under. However, it should be noted that African Americans
infants and young children were again overrepresented as
victims. In 2003­04, all firearms related infant/child homicide
victims were African American.
Multiple victims
In 2003­04, 71% of firearms related homicides of infants and
young children involved multiple victims. Moreover, multiple
victims were involved in 7% of homicides in which weapons
designated as ``other'' were used. Further, multiple victims
were involved in 4% of homicides where blunt instruments
used and 44% of homicides involving a combination of
weapons.
Three of these multiple victim incidents occurred within
the context of intimate partner violence, three others
occurred as the result of arguments, and one was precipitated
by robbery. Arson was cited as the cause of death for one
victim while another victim was murdered during an assault.
The specific circumstances surrounding the deaths of four
infants were unknown.
Location and timing
Homes and apartments including driveway, porch, or yard
were the most frequent locations/places where infant/child
homicide occurred. Public highways, streets, roads, as well as
commercial, recreational, and natural areas were locations
where at least one homicide occurred. Overall, 97% of infant/
child homicides in 2003­04 occurred in a home/apartment.
The percentage of deaths occurring in this location varied
minimally across racial groups ranging from 91% among
African American male infants/children, to 100% for both
African American and white female infants and young
children.
Crude rate comparisons reveal that African American male
infants and young children were 3.3 times more likely to be
killed in homes or apartments than their white male
counterparts (95% CI 2.0 to 5.5). Moreover, African
American male infants and young children were 4.3 times
more likely to be killed in these locations than white female
infants and young children (95% CI 2.5 to 7.3). Similarly, for
African American females aged four years and under, the
probability of being murdered in a home or apartment was
3.8 times greater than that for white males (95% CI 2.4 to
6.2) and 4.8 times more than that of white females (95% CI
2.8 to 8.3). Lastly, prior studies have suggested that certain
days of the week may be linked to a greater number of
homicide occurrences among certain populations.14 15

DISCUSSION
Implications for prevention
Infant/child homicide is a serious issue. It is essential that the
public health community continue to develop and refine
prevention and intervention strategies aimed at curtailing the
incidence and prevalence of this phenomenon. In order to
develop appropriately targeted infanticide prevention and
intervention programs, it is vital to have an informed
knowledge of risk factors associated with this outcome.
Such efforts may be bolstered by the use of information
regarding the circumstances, events, and conditions related
to infant/child homicide.
The current study identified the importance of the NVDRS
as a surveillance tool, and why it should be considered in
future analyses related to the study of child maltreatment in
general and infant/child homicide in particular. The use of
NVDRS data allowed for a broad examination of the
circumstances, conditions, and patterns related to infant/
child homicide across all participating states. Few surveil-
lance data are able to provide information pertaining to
victim-suspect relationships, weapon type, multiple victims,
location, and timing in the study of infant/child homicide.
Hence, the NVDRS should continue to be developed and used
to monitor patterns and possible trends related to infant/child
homicide.
Circumstances and characteristics
NVDRS data indicate that African American infants and
young children are at substantially greater risk for homicide
victimization than are their white counterparts. Moreover,
infant/child homicides were primarily perpetrated either by
parents or friends and acquaintances and committed with
weapons designated as ``other''. Lastly, the majority of these
offences occurred in a home or an apartment. These findings
corroborate prior research which asserts that infants and
young children are most often murdered by those who are
charged with, and/or responsible for their care and that
homicides among this population are concentrated in
primary care-giving environments.2 16
Within the context of the NVDRS, the designation ``other''
includes household items that because of close proximity or
accessibility may be used as weapons of opportunity. This
might indicate that a sudden loss of temper may play a
noteworthy role in homicides among infants and young
children.17 It is plausible that some individuals are simply
unable to effectively cope with the demands and pressures of
daily living and thus lash out in anger that unfortunately
results in the death of a child. Certainly, the responsibility
and care for young children can be extremely demanding.
This, along with other duties, commitments, and responsi-
bilities may over-tax individuals who have less than adequate
coping resources, including lack of help-seeking behaviors
and social support networks.
High risk groups
African Americans and other minorities are disproportio-
nately exposed to marginal socioeconomic conditions.8 10 18
Such conditions may compound the stressors associated with
childcare, deplete internal coping reserves, and make it
extremely difficult to access resources (for example, personal
counseling services) that might reduce the likelihood of
infant/child homicide. Some researchers have explored this
supposition via the economic stress hypothesis which
predicts maternal aggression and lethal violence in the
context of economic stress.19 The comprehensive nature of
the NVDRS makes it a prime vehicle by which to more
thoroughly explore this hypothesis.
Recommendations
To reduce the potential for infant/child homicide, the public
health community should use information like that provided
by the NVDRS to identify emerging patterns and risk factors
that may portend this most unfortunate outcome.
Furthermore, in light of the racial disparities discussed
herein, it is essential that the public health community
develop prevention and intervention efforts that are sensitive
to and reflective of the populations with whom they are to be
used.7
Limitations
The current study is subject to several limitations that can be
attributed to the fluid nature of the NVDRS and the recent
nature of its development and implementation. First, child
abuse and maltreatment are widely acknowledged but largely
untested risk factors for infant/child homicides.20 In the
current investigation, the Child Fatality Review (CFR)
records were examined in an effort to obtain additional
information on the circumstances associated with infant/
child homicides. CFR records were available for only 13%
(n = 9) of infant/child homicides in 2003 and 12% (n = 7) of
infant/child homicides in 2004. In those cases wherein a child
fatality review was conducted, most contained responses of
No, Unknown, Not available, Not reported, Not collected, or were
missing variables that may have indicated a prior history of
child maltreatment within the victim's household. These
findings are due to the fact that the collection of CFR data is
currently optional and also that only two states were funded
to assess the availability and feasibility of collecting data
from child fatality review teams. As a result, the CFR data
cannot currently be used to extend our knowledge of the
circumstances surrounding homicides among infants and
young children. It is possible that the utility of this
component of the NVDRS will increase substantially if CFR
data are redefined as a primary NVDRS data element and
subsequently collected more widely by NVDRS member
states. The success of such an expansion would, nevertheless,
hinge largely on availability (and standardization) of CFR
data for all child deaths. The data currently available pertain
largely to fatalities stemming from specific causes; the
specific cause given attention may vary by state and by the
data year of interest.
Moreover, the data did not contain information on
household socioeconomic status when this study was
conducted. Prior research has demonstrated a consistent link
between socioeconomic status and rates of homicide. States
with large numbers of impoverished women of childbearing
age tend to have high rates of infant/child homicide.4 18 19
Ongoing efforts to expand the scope of the geospatial and
economic data provided by the NVDRS will make it possible
to eventually link NVDRS data to the zip codes of victims,
suspects, and incident locations. This information could then
be cross referenced with census tract data to obtain aggregate
information pertaining to socioeconomic status. Such infor-
mation may allow further exploration of the relationship
between socioeconomic status and infant/child homicide.
Lastly, two final facts must be noted. First, while every
effort is made to include all appropriate deaths, some might
have been missed or not entered into the system when the
present study was initiated. As a result it is suggested that the
current research be considered an interim look at the NVDRS.
Second, the presented rates and percentages only apply to the
states used in the study's central analyses, although it is
plausible that the results are more broadly applicable.
