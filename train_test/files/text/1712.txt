Abstract
Background: The high prevalence of childhood obesity underscores the importance of
monitoring population trends in children's activity and screen time, and describing associations with
child age, gender, race/ethnicity, and weight status. Our objective was to estimate the proportion
of young children in the US who have low levels of active play or high levels of screen time, or who
have both these behaviors, and to describe associations with age, gender, race/ethnicity, and weight
status.
Methods: We analyzed data collected during the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys 2001­2004, a US nationally representative cross-sectional study. We studied 2964 children
aged 4.00 to 11.99 years. Our main outcomes were reported weekly times that the child played or
exercised hard enough to sweat or breathe hard (active play), daily hours the child watched
television/videos, used computers, or played computer games (screen time), and the combination
of low active play and high screen time. Low active play was defined as active play 6 times or less
per week. High screen time was defined as more than 2 hours per day. We accounted for the
complex survey design in analyses and report proportions and 95% confidence intervals. We used
Wald Chi-square to test for differences between proportions. To identify factors associated with
low active play and high screen time, we used multivariate logistic regression.
Results: Of US children aged 4 to 11 years, 37.3% (95% confidence interval, 34.1% to 40.4%) had
low levels of active play, 65.0% (95% CI, 61.4% to 68.5%) had high screen time, and 26.3% (95% CI,
23.8% to 28.9%) had both these behaviors. Characteristics associated with a higher probability of
simultaneously having low active play and high screen time were older age, female gender, non-
Hispanic black race/ethnicity, and having a BMI-for-age 95th percentile of the CDC growth
reference.
Conclusion: Many young children in the US are reported to have physical activity and screen time
behaviors that are inconsistent with recommendations for healthy pediatric development. Children
who are overweight, approaching adolescence, girls, and non-Hispanic blacks may benefit most
from public health policies and programs aimed at these behaviors.

Background
The prevention of childhood obesity is a public health pri-
ority in the United States [1]. Recommendations for the
prevention of childhood obesity call for children to be
active daily and to spend less time in sedentary pursuits,
such as watching television and videos and playing video
and computer games, collectively known as screen time
[2-6]. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommend
that children accumulate no more than 2 hours per day of
screen time [3,5], and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention recommend that children be active daily for at
least 60 minutes [7].
Few nationally representative analyses have been pub-
lished describing relationships between sociodemo-
graphic characteristics and physical activity in children
under age 12 [8-11], and we are unaware of published US
estimates of levels of activity in children younger than 6
years old. A recent analysis of accelerometry data from the
US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 2003­2004 found differences by gender and
race/ethnicity in activity level among 6 to 15 year old chil-
dren [11]. Analyses from NHANES III (1988­1994) of 8­
16 year old children's reported bouts of vigorous physical
activity per week also found differences in levels of physi-
cal activity relative to child age, gender, and race/ethnicity
[8]. Adolescent boys were more likely than girls to engage
in vigorous activity, but at younger ages no difference by
gender was observed; non-Hispanic white children
reported more bouts of vigorous activity per week than
non-Hispanic black or Mexican American children [8].
Among 9­13 year old US youth surveyed by telephone in
2002 [9], participation in organized physical activity was
related to race/ethnicity, parental education, and parental
income with Hispanic and non-Hispanic black youth less
likely than non-Hispanic white youth to have participated
in organized physical activity in the preceding 7 days, and
greater parental education and income being associated
with greater likelihood of the child having participated in
organized physical activity [10]. Participation in organized
physical activity was not related to gender or age, but boys
were significantly more likely than girls to report having
participated in free-time physical activity during the prior
week (74.1% vs 80.5%) [10].
Associations between television viewing, media use, and
children's sociodemographic and weight status character-
istics have been studied more frequently [12-17]. Many
studies have found that television viewing time and com-
puter use is similar for boys and girls; however boys are
more likely than girls to play video games, and boys may
be somewhat more likely than girls to have very high
screen times (>4 hours per day) [15].
Sedentary behavior is not simply the inverse of physical
activity [18-20], and children who are highly physically
active may also spend a lot of time in sedentary activities.
Thus it is important to understand the prevalence and
sociodemographic correlates of low levels of physical
activity and high levels of sedentary behaviour individu-
ally, as well as in combination. Very little is known about
how risk behaviors, such as low levels of physical activity
or high levels of sedentary behavior, cluster together [21].
We are unaware of published reports representative of US
young children that describe the proportion of children
who have the combination of low levels of activity and
high levels of sedentary behaviour.
The high prevalence of childhood obesity underscores the
importance of monitoring population trends in children's
activity and screen time, and describing associations with
child age, gender, race/ethnicity, and weight status. Young
children's physical, social, emotional, and cognitive
development is enhanced by active play, particularly
unstructured play [22]. Adequate daily activity and lim-
ited levels of sedentary behavior benefit children's cardio-
vascular health, coordination, fitness, and psychosocial
development [23-26] in addition to lowering risk for
obesity.
Our objective was to estimate the proportion of US chil-
dren aged 4 to 11 years who are participating in low levels
of active play, having greater than 2 hours per day of
screen time, or both participating in low levels of active
play and having more than 2 hours per day of screen time.
We also sought to understand the relationship of these
behaviors with child age, gender, race/ethnicity, and
weight status.
Methods
We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001­2004. These data
are representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized,
US population. Data from cycles 2001­2002 and 2003­
2004 were combined as recommended by NHANES ana-
lytic guidelines [27]. Survey design and operations are
described in detail, and data are publicly available at
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm. The Ohio State
University biomedical IRB has determined that because
data from NHANES are publicly available and partici-
pants cannot be identified, analyses of NHANES do not
require IRB review.
Analyses included 2964 children aged 4.00 to 11.99 years.
Children were examined in the NHANES Mobile Exami-
nation Center. A proxy reporter (typically a parent, most
often the mother) responded to interview questions about
the subject child; for simplicity we will say 'parent'
throughout this report to indicate the proxy reporter.

Active play
A parent reported the number of times per week their
child played or exercised actively. Frequency and not
duration of activity was assessed for children under age
12. The wording of the question asked was, 'Now I'd like
to ask you some questions about {Child's} activities.
How many times per week does {Child} play or exercise
enough to make {him/her} sweat and breathe
hard?'[28,29] We categorized a child as having a low level
of active play if the response to this question was less than
7 times per week. The American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP) [4], the American Heart Association [6], Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [7], and the US
Department of Health and Human Services and US
Department of Agriculture [30] recommend that children
be physically active daily for at least sixty minutes.
Screen time
A parent reported the average hours per day their child sat
and watched television or videos, and also the time the
child used a computer or played computer games. The
specific questions asked were, 'Over the past 30 days, on
average about how many hours per day did {Child} sit
and watch TV or videos? and 'Over the past 30 days, on
average about how many hours per day did {Child} use a
computer or play computer games?" In each case,
response options were: "less than 1 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours,
3 hours, 4 hours, 5 or more hours, or none" [28,29]. We
coded a response of 'less than 1 hour' as 0.5 hours and a
response of 5 or more hours as 5 hours. We summed aver-
age hours of television/videos and computers/computer
games to estimate "screen time." We defined high screen
time as greater than 2 hours per day.
Weight status ­ BMI-for-age 95th
Children's weight and standing height were measured
using a standardized protocol as part of the physical
examination in the Mobile Examination Center. Four chil-
dren, who were weighed while wearing a medical device,
were excluded from analyses. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of
height in meters. Age and gender-specific BMI percentiles
were calculated using the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's BMI-for-age growth reference [31]. We
defined obesity as having a BMI z-score 95th percentile
relative to the CDC reference [5].
Race/ethnicity
Race/ethnicity of the child was reported by the parent and
classified by NHANES as Mexican American, non-His-
panic black, non-Hispanic white, other Hispanic, or
other. The category 'other' includes individuals who indi-
cated a single race/ethnicity other than those above, iden-
tified with 2 or more race/ethnicity categories
(multiracial), or were missing information on race/eth-
nicity. In our logistic regression analyses we combined the
categories 'other Hispanic' and 'other.'
Covariates
The child's country of birth was reported by the parent;
children were categorized as born in the US, or born out-
side the US. We used the poverty income ratio (PIR) as a
measure of socioeconomic status. PIR is a measure of
wealth that is based on family income in relation to US
Census Bureau income thresholds for poverty; these
income thresholds take into account family size and com-
position. Higher PIR values denote greater wealth. To pro-
tect confidentiality in NHANES, PIR is top-coded at 5 for
all participants with a PIR above 5 [32].
Analytic approach
Children were grouped by age at last birthday into age cat-
egories as follows: 4­5 year olds, 6­8 year olds, 9­11 year
olds. To account for the complex survey design, sample
weights were applied in all analyses. Analyses were con-
ducted with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC);
prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were
calculated using PROC SURVEYMEANS and PROC SUR-
VEYFREQ. We used Wald Chi-square to test for differences
between proportions and logistic regression (PROC SUR-
VEYLOGISTIC) to test for age-related trends. An alpha
level of 0.05 was required for statistical significance. To
identify sociodemographic and weight status factors asso-
ciated with low levels of active play and high screen time,
we used logistic regression with age (as a continuous var-
iable), gender, race/ethnicity, weight status, poverty
income ratio, and whether the child was born outside the
US as predictors. We hypothesized the possibility of a
number of interactions between these risk factors, and
therefore we systematically tested for interactions between
age and gender, gender and race/ethnicity, gender and
weight status, and race/ethnicity and weight status in
logistic regression models.
Results
Demographic characteristics of US children aged 4 to 11
years are presented in Table 1. The prevalence of obesity
(BMI z-score 95th percentile) among 4­5 year old and 6­
8 year old children was approximately 15%, and was
almost 20% among 9­11 year old children.
The number of times per week that children in the sample
were reported to play or exercise hard enough to sweat or
breathe hard (active play) ranged from a minimum of 0 to
a maximum of 77. Weighted to be representative of chil-
dren aged 4 to 11 years in the US, ten percent of children
engaged in this level of active play two or fewer times per
week, and ten percent of children engaged in this level of
active play ten or more times per week. Table 2 presents
the median (25th percentile, 75th percentile) and mean

(95% confidence interval) of the times per week of active
play by gender and age category. For all age-gender com-
binations the median and 75th percentiles were 7 times
per week, except for girls aged 9­11 years where the
median was 6. The median number of hours of television/
videos watched per day by US children age 4 to 11 years
was two hours; ten percent of children watched 30 min-
utes or less per day and ten percent of children watched 4
or more hours per day. Half of US children age 4 to 11
years used computers or computer games for 30 minutes
or less per day, ten percent of children used computers or
computer games 2 hours per day or more, and the top five
percent used computers or computer games 3 or more
hours per day. Table 2 presents the mean (95% confi-
dence interval) of reported television viewing and compu-
ter/computer game use by gender and age category. The
mean hours of reported computer/computer game use
ranged from 0.6 hours per day for 4­5 year old girls to 1.2
hours per day for 9­11 year old boys. The correlation
between active play and screen time was -0.08 (Spearman
r, p = 0.001) for boys and -0.02 (Spearman r, p = 0.34) for
girls.

Comparisons by gender and age
Overall, 37.3% (95% confidence interval, 34.1% to
40.4%) of US children aged 4 to 11 years were reported to
play or exercise hard enough to sweat or breathe hard less
than 7 times per week (low levels of active play). The pro-
portion of boys with low levels of active play (31.4%) was
lower than the proportion of girls with low levels of active
play (43.4%) (Table 3). In each age category, girls were
more likely than boys to have low levels of active play,
although in the youngest age group (4­5 years) this differ-
ence did not reach statistical significance at an alpha level
of 0.05 (p = 0.061). For boys and girls, the percentage of
children with low levels of active play was higher at older
ages. Sixty-five percent (95% CI, 61.4% to 68.5%) of US
children 4 to 11 years old overall (67.7% of boys and
62.0% of girls) were reported to have more than 2 hours
per day of screen time (high screen time). The prevalence
was higher at older ages for boys and girls (Table 3).
Although fewer girls than boys were reported to have >2
hours per day of screen time, these gender differences
were not statistically significant within age categories. The
percentage of US children 4 to 11 years old who were
reported to have both low levels of active play and high
screen time was 26.3% (95% CI, 23.8% to 28.9%) overall
and was 23.7% for boys and 29.1% for girls. Girls were
more likely than boys overall to have low levels of active
play and high screen time, but when stratified by age cat-
egory this gender difference was only statistically signifi-
cant in the 6­8 year age category (18.8% boys, 26.9%
girls, p = 0.009). The likelihood of this combination was
greater at older ages for both boys and girls; 31.2% of boys
and 37.7% of girls in the 9­11 year age category had both
low levels of active play and high screen time (Table 3).
Comparisons by weight status
Among US children 4 to 11 years old, 16.9% (95% CI,
14.8% to 18.9%) had a BMI 95th percentile. Overall, chil-
dren with a BMI 95th percentile (obese) were more likely
than children with a BMI below the 95th percentile (non-
obese) to have low levels of active play (42.5% vs. 36.4%,
p = 0.053; borderline statistical significance), were more
likely to have screen time >2 hours per day (70.9% vs.
64.3%, p = 0.040), and were more likely to have both
behaviors simultaneously (32.8% vs. 25.2%, p = 0.031).
Table 4 presents the percentage of children with low levels
of active play, high screen time, and both behaviors strat-
ified by gender and weight status. When stratified by gen-
der, differences between obese and non-obese children
(age 4 to 11 years overall) were statistically significant in
girls for high screen time, and the combination of low

active play and high screen time. Obese girls were not sta-
tistically significantly less likely than non-obese girls to
have low levels of active play (47.9% vs 42.7%, p =
0.299). In boys, obese boys 4 to 11 years old were more
likely than non-obese boys to have low levels of active
play (38.1% vs 30.1%) but this comparison failed to reach
statistical significance (p = 0.099), and appeared to be
driven by the 9­11 year age category in which 53.3%

of active play compared to 36.5% (95% CI, 28.6% to

mates in the obese subgroup are wide, particularly when
stratified by age category, due to small sample sizes within
these cells.

panic black girls to be more likely than Mexican American
girls (31.9% vs 24.7%) to have this combination of
behaviors (Table 5).
Multivariate models: sociodemographic and weight status
risk factors
We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to iden-
tify characteristics of a child being reported to have low
levels of active play, or to have >2 hours per day of screen
time, or to have both of these behaviors together. Param-
eter estimates, odds ratios, and 95% confidence limits are
presented in Table 6. Interactions between age and gen-
der, gender and race/ethnicity, gender and weight status,
and race/ethnicity and weight status were tested and were
not statistically significant. In a multivariate adjusted
model, the following characteristics were associated with
increased probability of having low levels of active play:
older age, female gender, Mexican American race/ethnic-
ity, and higher poverty income ratio (greater wealth). As
predictors of having high screen time, older age, male gen-
der, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, and having been
born in the US were associated with increased probability.
The likelihood of a child having both low levels of active
play and high screen time was increased with older age,
female gender, non-Hispanic black or 'other' race/ethnic-
ity, obesity, and having been born in the US. Based on this
latter model, a girl would be 33% (95% CI: 8% to 63%)
more likely than an otherwise similar boy to have both
low levels of active play and >2 hours per day of screen
time. A child with a BMI 95th percentile would be 39%
(95% CI: 1% to 93%) more likely than a non-obese child
to have both these behaviors.

mates of the proportion of US children (age 4 to 11 years)
by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and weight status, who
have low levels of active play and high levels of screen
time. As compared to adolescents, for younger children
less is known about of these behaviors at the national
level. In addition we provide estimates of the proportion
of US children who both have low levels of active play and
high screen time. Little is known about how frequently
these behaviors cluster in young children and we are una-
ware of previously published nationally representative
estimates describing the proportion and sociodemo-
graphic characteristics of children who have low levels of
activity in combination with high levels of sedentary
behavior.
Our analyses suggest that a substantial proportion of
young children in the US are inadequately active and
highly sedentary. Low levels of active play and high levels
of screen time in young children are likely contributors to
childhood obesity rates in the US. When these behaviors
are combined, as in almost 20% of 4­5 year old boys and
girls and over 35% of 9­11 year old girls, the positive
energy balance required for excess weight gain is particu-
larly likely to result [33]. That sedentary behavior and
physical activity are not strongly negatively correlated is
perhaps surprising, and whether they are correlated
depends upon how both are measured, but having a high
level of sedentary behavior does not presume that one has
a low level of physical activity [19,20]. Consistent with
this, in our analyses the correlation between active play
and screen time was small (-0.08 in boys and -0.02 in
girls). In addition, other than age and gender, the sociode-
mographic factors most strongly associated with low
active play were not the same as those associated with
high screen time. Based on our multivariate models, Mex-
ican American children had increased likelihood of low
active play whereas non-Hispanic black children had
increased likelihood of high screen time. In contrast to
other studies [18], we observed that higher wealth (pov-
erty to income ratio) was associated with increased likeli-
hood of low active play, but not associated with
likelihood of high screen time.
Independent of age, gender, race/ethnicity, poverty to
income ratio, and non-US country of origin, children with
a BMI z-score above the 95th percentile were more likely to
have the combination of low levels of active play and high
screen time. Although, cross-sectional analyses such as
these do not provide information about cause and effect,
they do indicate co-occurrence; regardless of causality,
children with high BMIs are at higher risk for obesity as
adults [34,35], and the combination of low levels of active
play and high levels of screen time may increase the like-
lihood of obesity persistence into adulthood.
Our findings are consistent with a growing body of
research demonstrating high levels of television viewing
and media use in children in the US and other developed
countries. Our study indicated that 65% of 4 to 11 year
old children in the US spend, on average, more than 2
hours per day in front of a television or computer screen
(high screen time). Even for preschool children (4­5
years), 60% of boys and 55% of girls had high screen time.
By age 10, this proportion was above 70% in both gen-
ders. This is comparable to estimates from a study of 10 to
12 year old children in Melbourne Australia, in which
61% of boys and 57% of girls reported watching, on aver-
age, more than 2 hours per day of television [36]. Like-
wise, in a nationally representative survey of Canadian
adolescents, 59% of girls and 66% of boys watched more
than 2 hours per day of television [14]. Analyses of the US
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
1988­1994, indicated that 26% of 8 to 16 year old chil-
dren watched 4 or more hours of television per day [8].
Similarly, in the Health Behaviour in School-aged Chil-
dren study (1988), the proportion of 11 to 15 year old
youth watching more than 4 hours per day of television
was approximately 19% in Austria, 21% in Norway, 23%
in Finland, 28% in Hungary and Scotland, and 37% in
Wales [37]. In a recent analysis of NHANES 1999­2002,
Mendoza et al. examined preschooler's prior day media
use and reported that 31.4% of 2 to 5 year old children
had watched greater than 2 hours per day of television/
videos on the previous day; when computer use was
included 37.3% of preschoolers had greater than 2 hours
per day of screen time [16]. Consistent with this, in a US
nationally representative telephone survey conducted in
2005, 44% of 3 to 4 year olds and 30% of 5 to 6 year olds
had media use greater than 2 hours per day [17]. These
estimates are substantially lower than our estimate for 4 to
5 year old children of 58% having greater than 2 hours per
day of screen time; this difference may be due in part to
how screen time was assessed. In the studies by Mendoza
et al. [16] and Vandewater et al. [17] parents were asked
to report how much television, video, and computer time
their child had on the previous day, whereas our estimates
are based on questions asking parents to report the average
hours per day their child watched or used a computer dur-
ing the previous 30 days. Between NHANES 1999­2000
and NHANES 2001­2002 the time period referenced in
the questions about children's television viewing and
computer/video use changed from the prior day to the
average of the previous 30 days [38].
In our analyses of 4 to 11 year old children, age was
related to screen time, with older children having greater
daily screen time than younger children. This is consistent
with other studies of preadolescent children [15,39,40].
Research suggests that the association between age and
screen time may be curvilinear with increasing levels in
BMC Public Health 2008, 8:366 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/8/366

early childhood, a peak at about age 9 to 12 years and
decreasing levels in adolescence [15]. Gender was related
weakly to screen time, with 67.7% of boys and 62.0% of
girls having more than 2 hours per week; but this gender
difference was more pronounced in the 9­11 year olds
than in the 4­5 year olds or 6­8 year olds. Estimates from
our multivariate model indicate that a girl was 77% as
likely to have high screen time as an otherwise similar
boy. Some of this gender difference in screen time may be
due to computer/video game use rather than television
viewing [36]. Consistent with other studies [41], children
who were born outside the US were less likely to have high
screen time.
Many studies have shown an association between screen
time and increased adiposity in children [8,12,13,16,20].
Evidence supports a number of different, but potentially
correlated, mechanisms by which screen time may influ-
ence risk for obesity; these include exposing children to a
greater degree of food advertising and thus potentially
influencing their intake of energy dense, nutrient poor,
snack foods [42-44], encouraging greater food consump-
tion when children eat while viewing television [45,46],
and impacting sleep quality or quantity [47,48]. Whether
or not screen time displaces physical activity is controver-
sial [19,49]. In our analyses, a statistically significantly
higher proportion of obese girls had high screen time
compared to non-obese girls (72% vs 61%) and this was
particularly true in the 6­8 year age category in which
78% of obese girls had high screen time compared to 61%
of non-obese girls. In boys, the difference between obese
and non-obese boys overall (70% vs. 68%) was consider-
ably smaller and not statistically significant. Interestingly,
as in the girls, it was the 6­8 year old age category for boys
in which the difference in prevalence by weight status was
largest (75% of obese compared to 64% of non-obese 6­
8 year old boys); however this difference in boys is not sta-
tistically significant, and thus might be due to sampling
error. We speculate that the influence of obesity on a
child's screen time may be different by gender because of
societal differences in how obesity is perceived in boys
and girls; stigmatization of obesity is greater in girls, and
girls are more likely than boys to have concerns about
appearance [50]. It is possible that obese girls are thus
more likely to socially withdraw and choose activities,
such as screen time, that are typically more solitary. How-
ever, our analyses are cross-sectional and as such provide
no information about whether or not television viewing
causes obesity. In our multivariate model, obesity was
associated with increased likelihood of high screen time;
however this was not a statistically significant association
when controlling for the other variables in the model.
Estimates of physical activity from nationally representa-
tive samples of children under age 12 years are few; these
estimates for US adolescents are more available because
physical activity is assessed in the Youth Risk Behavior
Surveillance Survey [51], and was assessed in the National
Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health [52]. Compari-
son of estimates from our analyses of levels of active play
to the few estimates of physical activity that are available
for preadolescent children in the US is difficult because of
differences in question wording, respondent (parent or
child), and when the data were collected. In 2002, a
nationally representative telephone survey of school-age
(9 to 13 years) youth assessed self-reported participation
in organized and unorganized physical activity and found
that 61.5% of these children had not engaged in any
organized physical activity (outside of school) in the pre-
vious 7 days, and 22.6% had not engaged in any unorgan-
ized physical activity [9,10]. Published analyses of
NHANES III (1988­1994) indicate that 80% of 8 to 16
year old US children had engaged in 3 or more bouts of
vigorous activity in the previous week [8]. Recently pub-
lished analyses of physical activity as measured by acceler-
ometry in US 6 to 11 year old children indicate that 49%
of boys and 35% of girls in this age range accumulate 60
minutes or more of moderate or vigorous activity on at
least 5 out of 7 days [11]. These findings are not inconsist-
ent with our estimates of low levels of active play among
26% and 39% of 6­8 year old boys and girls respectively,
and 39% and 53% of 9­11 year old boys and girls. Inter-
national comparisons of the level of physical activity
among 10 to 16 year old youth in 34 countries indicate
that US youth may be more active than youth in other
developed countries; 49.5% of US youth in the 2001­
2002 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Study
reported engaging in at least 60 minutes of physical activ-
ity on 5 or more days per week, and this percentage was
higher than any other country (Ireland was next highest at
47.2% of youth and France was lowest at 19.3%) [53].
In adolescents, age-related declines in physical activity
among girls and boys have been observed repeatedly [54-
58]. Younger children have been studied less frequently,
but evidence suggests that age-related declines in physical
activity may begin before adolescence. Trost et al [59]
studied 1110 first- through twelfth-grade public school
students in Western Massachusetts (US) and found that
physical activity was highest at the youngest grades and
decreased over the older grades. In a prospective study of
379 Iowa (US) children observed at approximately age 5.5
years and again 3 years later, physical activity as assessed
by accelerometery was higher at baseline than at follow-
up [39]. Troiano et al [11] analyzed physical activity as
assessed by accelerometery in NHANES 2003­2004 and
found that both the average accelerometery counts per
minute and minutes per day in moderate or vigorous
activity were higher for 6­11 year old boys than 12­15
year old boys, with a similar pattern by age for girls. In our
BMC Public Health 2008, 8:366 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/8/366

analyses of NHANES 2001­2004, a larger sample size
allowed for narrower age categories. We observed that 9­
11 year old boys were more likely than 6­8 year old boys
to have low levels of active play, and that the same was
true for girls. In the European Youth Heart Study, 9 year
old and 15 year old children from Denmark, Estonia, and
Portugal were assessed, and the older children had lower
levels of physical activity than the younger children irre-
spective of country or gender [60]. In contrast, analyses of
US children studied in 1988­1994 (NHANES III) indi-
cated that for boys and girls 11­13 year olds were some-
what more active than 8­10 year olds [8]. We observed
that boys were more active than girls across the age range
we analyzed, and this is consistent with many previous
studies [11,55,57-60]. In our multivariate model older age
and female gender were both associated with increased
likelihood of low active play.
Assessment of physical activity in population-based stud-
ies of children presents substantial challenges [61]. Objec-
tive monitoring of physical activity, as occurs with
accelerometry, is beyond the scope of most studies and
not without its own methodological issues [61,62]. Begin-
ning in 2003­2004, NHANES included assessment of
activity by accelerometry for participants over age 6 years
[11]. Questionnaire-based methods are more common,
and rely on self- or proxy-reports (the latter most often by
a parent). Evidence for the validity of parent reports of
children's physical activity is quite limited. A comparison
of parent and child-reports of physical activity in seventh-
through twelfth-grade youth found moderate agreement
in the report of physical activity correlates [63]. In a recent
study comparing early elementary school-aged children's
responses to those of their parents, moderate agreement
was found for reporting of commonly played games and
activities and transportation to school [64]. Young chil-
dren are generally unable to accurately report the number
of minutes spent in physical activity [65], and therefore
parent reports or objective observations are necessary. In
NHANES, subjects age 12 years and older are asked a
series of questions regarding their frequency, duration,
intensity, and type of physical activity, whereas for
younger children, a parent is asked to make a much cruder
assessment of frequency of bouts of moderate to vigorous
activity. In contrast, the screen time items query the
number of hours of television or video viewing, or using
the computer. This approach makes good sense for televi-
sion viewing, where TV is generally consumed in 30-
minute portions [66]. However, this may not be true for
other aspects of screen time, and little empirical data are
available to assess the accuracy of parental reports of chil-
dren's computer or video use.
Several limitations of our analyses are noteworthy. First,
our estimates of the proportion of children who have low
levels of active play are likely to be underestimates. We
categorized children as having low levels of active play if
their parent's response to the question, ''How many times
per week does {Child} play or exercise enough to make
{him/her} sweat and breathe hard'' was 6 or fewer. How-
ever, some children who had 7 or more times of active
play per week may not play actively daily; for example, a
child could be play actively 7 times on 1 day and not again
the remainder of the week. Second, active play and screen
time were not measured directly; a proxy (generally a par-
ent) reported the frequency with which their child played
or exercised hard enough to sweat or breathe hard, and
the hours per day their child watched television and vid-
eos or played on a computer. Research on social desirabil-
ity [67] would suggest that it is more likely that a parent
would over-report activity, and under-report screen time
than the reverse. For all these reasons, we believe that our
estimates of the proportion of children who have low lev-
els of active play or more than 2 hours per day of screen
time are conservative. Third, some aspects of screen time
may not have been captured; video games were not asked
about directly, and it is not clear whether parents would
include video games when responding to the question
about computers and computer games. In addition, our
analyses are cross-sectional, and thus causal associations
cannot be inferred between the sociodemographic and
weight status factors we studied in relation to low active
play, high screen time, and the combination of low active
play and high screen time.
Conclusion
Many childhood obesity prevention policies call for chil-
dren to be physically active daily and to limit their televi-
sion viewing and other screen time. It is worrisome that
many young children may not be engaging in active play
every day. Perhaps more worrisome is the combination of
high screen time and low levels of active play. When high
screen time is combined with low levels of active play it
raises questions about how young children are spending
their time, and the impact this may have on their develop-
ment and ultimately the health of our society. Our analy-
ses make clear the potential for all segments of the
population of 4 to 11 year old children in the US to
become more active and less sedentary. Children who are
approaching adolescence, girls, and non-Hispanic blacks
are most likely to have low levels of active play and high
screen time, and may benefit most from public health pol-
icies and programs aimed at these behaviors.
