Introduction
The metabolic syndrome, as the cluster of hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and body obesity, is a com-
mon cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases and
one of the most serious threats to public health. It is under-
stood that adipose tissue produces and secretes some pro-
inflammatory factors. Dysregulated production of
proinflammatory factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-
(TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), is
associated with the pathophysiology of obesity-related
disorders.
Patients with essential hypertension and obesity are at
increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Several recent clinical
trials have suggested that blockade of the renin­angiotensin
system (RAS) may protect against the development of de
novo diabetes in `at risk' patients.1 Evidence shows that
the RAS may have a direct role in the pathogenesis of dia-
betes. Local RAS was activated in the adipocyte, which
makes the adipose tissue the potential target of angiotensin
II receptor blockers.
In this context, the present study was designed to eluci-
date the effect of telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor
blocker, on the proinflammatory factors' secretion using
3T3-L1 adipocytes. We hereby show that telmisartan can
decrease the proinflammatory factors'secretion from 3T3-
L1 adipocytes and decrease the adiposity, which may favor
the adipocytes with insulin sensitization.

Abstract
Aim: To investigate the effect of telmisartan on the lipometabolisms and the proinflammatory factors secreted from
3T3-L1 adipocytes and to explore the possible mechanisms.
Materials and methods: Telmisartan was applied to interfere with mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The culture's free fatty
acids, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) were evaluated. Oil Red O staining was used to determine
the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 18F-FDG uptake levels corrected for protein content were determined by cellular
radioactivity. The total RNA was isolated for hybridization experimentation in the microarray.
Results: Telmisartan reduced lipid storage and increased 18F-FDG uptake in a dose-dependent manner, reduced the
levels of IL-6 and TNF and increased those of free fatty acids. One hundred and fifty-seven differentially expressed genes
were found by microarray. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway involved in the secretion
of proinflammatory factor and lipid metabolisms was affected by telmisartan. The expression of endothelial nitric oxide
synthetase gene 3 (Nos3) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) was up-regulated by telmisartan.
Conclusions: Telmisartan affected lipometabolisms and the proinflammatory factors secreted from adipocytes. Nos3,
CPT1 and the MAPK pathway being affected by telmisartan may be the underlying cause of the improvement in lipid
metabolisms and secretion of proinflammatory factors of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Materials and methods
Cell culture and adipocyte differentiation
3T3-L1 cells (Shanghai Institute of Life Science of CAS,
Shanghai, China) were cultured and differentiated into adi-
pocytes as described previously.2 Briefly, 3T3-L1 cells
were immersed in DMEM plus 10% heat-inactivated FCS
(10% FCS/DMEM), housed in a humidified incubator set
at 5% CO2
and 37°C. Cells were grown for two days post-
confluence (referred to as day 0) in 10% FCS/DMEM.
Differentiation was induced with 10% FCS/DMEM con-
taining 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)
(Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), 1 µM dexamethasone (DX)
and 10 µg/ml insulin for three days. The cells were then
incubated in 10% FCS/DMEM with insulin for three days
and maintained thereafter with 10% FCS/DMEM to day
12. The medium was changed every other day. After dif-
ferentiation, more than 90% of the adipocytes displayed a
round shape with a cytoplasm completely filled with mul-
tiple fat droplets. Only cultures with a differentiation den-
sity 90% were used in experiments.
Treatments of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes
with various concentrations of telmisartan
The experiment was designed for five groups according to
the concentrations of telmisartan (Sigma-Aldrich, MO,
USA): control group (DMSO), T1 group (0.01 µg/ml), T2
group (0.1ug/ml), T3 group (1ug/ml) and T4 group (10ug/
ml). Telmisartan was dissolved in 100% DMSO at 1 mg/
ml, diluted in RPMI 1640 medium to a concentration of 10
µg/ml and stored at ­20°C until use. The final concentra-
tion of DMSO was less than 0.1% and considered to be
non-toxic to the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
Oil Red O staining
The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) twice, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h and then
stained with 0.6% (w/v) Oil Red O solution (60% isopro-
panol, 40% water) for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were
then washed with water to remove unbound dye. Stained
Oil Red O was eluted with isopropanol and quantified by
measuring the optical absorbance at 550 nm.
Proinflammatory factors and free fatty acids
assay of cultural medium
The concentrations of proinflammatory factors TNF- and
IL-6 were measured using a commercially available
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for rat
(Rapidbio, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. Each sample was measured in duplicate with a
microplate reader and expressed as means ± SEM. The
values of free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations were
obtained by enzymatic assay on an automatic analyzer.3
Cellular 2-[18F]-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake
measurements
Uptake measurements were performed in 3T3-L1 mature
adipocytes treated with 0.1% DMSO (control) and various
concentrations of telmisartan for three days by adding 370
kBq (10 Ci) of 2-[18F]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG;
Nuclear Medicine Department of Chinese PLA General
Hospital, Beijing, China) to the culture of cells and incu-
bating in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2
at 37°C.
Time course experiments showed that 18F-FDG uptake in
3T3-L1 adipocytes reached a relative plateau after 25 min
incubation (data not shown). Hence, the remaining 18F-
FDG uptake experiments were performed with 25-min
incubation, when the adherent cells were washed twice
with PBS and then lysed in 1 ml distilled water before the
radioactive counts were measured on a high-energy
-counter (Wallac). 18F-FDG uptake levels of each sample
were corrected for protein content as determined by the
Bradford method and expressed as percentage of uptake
relative to that of the control cells.
High throughput gene expression profiling by
microarray
In order to detect the possible genes involved in the effects
of telmisartan on the 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a cDNA microar-
ray analysis was performed for the chosen two groups:
control group and T2 group (telmisartan 0.1µg/ml). The
control and telmisartan-treated groups were treated with 1
ml Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, MD, USA). RNA isolation
and quality were checked by spectrophotometry. All pro-
cedures of the hybridization experiments of oligonucleo-
tide microarray analysis (CapitalBio 36k Mouse Genome
Array) were conducted by CapitalBio Corp. (Beijing,
China). 36k Mouse Genome OligoArray comprises 35,852
70-mer oligo probes from Mouse Genome Version 4.0 of
Operon (http://www.operon.com), representing approxi-
mately 25,000 genes and 38,000 transcripts of Mouse
Genome. The housekeeping genes ACTB, GAPD, LDHA
and RPL5 were printed as internal positive controls of
hybridization. The results were analyzed with LuxScan 3.0
and the KEGG and BioCarta genome databases retrieved
with CapitalBio Molecule Annotation System 4.0 software
for pathway analysis.4
Quantitative real time polymerase chain
reaction
Parts of the differential expressed genes screened by
the microarray were verified by quantitative real time

formed more than three times and similar results were
observed every time.
Results
Telmisartan reduced fat drop and lipid storage
of the 3T3-L1 adipocytes
To explore the potential effect of telmisartan on the lipid
storage of the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, 3T3-L1 preadi-
pocytes were differentiated with standard differentiation
inducers. During day 12 to 16 of differetiation, telmisartan
was added to the media every day. As shown in Figure 1,
higher doses of telmisartan (T2, T3 and T4 groups) reduced
fat drop and lipid storage of the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells
in a dose-dependent manner, while a lower dose (T1 group)
did not (Figure 1).
Effect of telmisartan on secretions of the
mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes
To examine a potential impact of telmisartan on the FFAs
and proinflammatory factors secreted from the differenti-
ated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, an assay of the culture levels of
IL-6 and TNF was performed. After differentiation of
3T3-L1 cells (day 12), the cells were incubated with vehi-
cle (DMSO) and 0.1 µg/ml (T2) and 1 µg/ml (T3) of tel-
misartan for 12 h. Then the levels of the proinflammatory
factors and FFAs in the cultural solution were measured.
Compared with the control, the higher dose (T3) of tel-
misartan decreased the levels of IL-6 and TNF and
increased those of FFAs. The lower dose (T2) of telmisar-
tan reduced the levels of IL-6 and had no significant effects
on the levels of TNF and FFAs (Figure 2).
Effect of telmisartan on 18F-FDG transport in
the mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes
To examine the potential impact of telmisartan on glucose
transport in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, an 18F-FDG
(2-DG) uptake assay was performed. Exposure of differen-
tiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes to telmisartan resulted in a sig-
nificant enhancement in 18F-FDG uptake in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 3). In the absence of insu-
lin, treatment with 1 and 10 µg/ml telmisartan for 72 h
increased 18F-FDG uptake to 174.5% ± 31.2% (p<0.05)
and 246.1 ± 38.6% (p<0.01), respectively. In the presence
of 1 µM insulin, 0.1, 1 and 10 µg/ml telmisartan signifi-
cantly augmented glucose uptake to 149.3% ± 21.5%
(p<0.05), 166.8% ± 28.7% (p<0.05) and 273.4% ± 47.2%
(p<0.05), respectively.
Result from microarray study and Q-PCR
To determine which gene might be involved in the adi-
posity, we used 3T3-L1 adipocytes from the control and
telmisartan (0.1 µg/ml) groups for microarray analysis.
One hundred and fifty-seven genes differentially
expressed between the groups were found from the
microarray. These genes were involved in transport, cell
adhesion and signal transduction of the adipocytes; pre-
liminary analyses of these gene functions and their rela-
tionship were performed (unpublished). In the present
study, we focused on analyzing the gene expression pro-
file related to the processes of lipometabolism and the
secretion of proinflammatory factors from the differenti-
ated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. By retrieving the KEGG and
BioCarta database, we propose that some cell signaling
pathways involved in the secretion process of adipocy-
tokines and proinflammatory factors were affected by
telmisartan. The significant pathways affected by tel-
misartan are listed in ascending order of p-values (and
multiple-comparison corrected Q-value)5 in Table 1.
According to the pathway analysis, the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was signifi-
cantly different. The analysis revealed nine differentially
expressed genes involved in the MAPK signaling path-
way (Table 2). Moreover, the result also showed that
Nos3 and CPT1 (Table 3), which encode the endothelial
nitric oxide synthase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase
1A respectively, were up-regulated. Consistent results
were obtained by the Q-PCR with Nos3, CPT1 and the
three select genes, which are Fos, Prkcc and Fgf22, from
the MAPK signaling pathway (Table 3).

Discussion
We have demonstrated that telmisartan reduced the lipid
storage and increased the 18F-FDG uptake in differentiated
3T3-L1 adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner. At the
same time, telmisartan reduced the levels of IL-6 and
TNF and increased that of FFAs in the culture medium.
Microarray analysis revealed that the MAPK signaling
pathway and oxidative stress were implicated in the secre-
tion of proinflammatory factor and lipometabolisms and
were affected by telmisartan. Regulation of Nos3 and
CPT1 expression by telmisartan, which was detected by
the microarray, may also be the underlying cause of the
improvement in the lipometabolisms.
Currently, more than 50 different adipokines are recog-
nized. The adipokines are implicated in a wide range of
physiological processes, including appetite and energy bal-
ance, glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, blood pres-
sure regulation, hemostasis and angiogenesis. IL-6 and
TNF are two of the inflammation-related proteins whose
circulating levels are increased during obesity and are
directly linked to inflammation and inflammatory

3T3-L1 cells in a dose-dependent manner in T2 (0.1 µg/ml, 15.2 ± 5.3% decrease), T3 (1 µg/ml, 26.8 ± 5.7% decrease) and T4 (10
µg/ml, 29.0% ± 6.9% decrease) groups, whereas a lower dose (T1 groups, 0.01 µg/ml) did not.

response.6 These proteins also include C-reactive protein,
interleukin-18, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and hap-
toglobin, which are the basis for the view that obesity is
characterized by chronic low grade inflammation. Adipose
tissue is one of the main origins of IL-6 and TNF.7 In addi-
tion, RAS components, including angiotensin II receptor,
exist in the adipocyte, which makes the adipose tissue a
potential target of angiotensin II receptor blockers.
Numerous clinical studies in subjects with a variety of car-
diovascular conditions have shown that blockade of the
renin­angiotensin system demonstrates suppression of pro-
inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF.8­10 Our
study showed that telmisartan reduced the levels of IL-6
and TNF, which suggests that the direct effect of telmisar-
tan on adipocyte secretion is one of the causes of the sup-
pression of IL-6 and TNF in vivo. In addition, the

microarray analysis indicates that the MAPK pathway and
oxidative stress implicate this effect of telmisartan.
We then tested the hypothesis that telmisartan exerted a
direct impact on adipocyte metabolism using the 3T3-L1
adipocytes model. The results showed that telmisartan
reduced fat drop and lipid storage of the adipocytes.
Previous research found that Ang II can significantly
increase triglyceride content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in
human adipose cells. These effects were mediated through
the Ang II AT2 receptor, but not Ang II type 1 receptor.11
As one of the Ang II AT1 receptor blockers, the action of
telmisartan on adipocyte may be independent of the Ang II
AT1 or AT2 receptor. We also demonstrate that telmisartan
dose-dependently augments 18F-FDG uptake both in the
basal and in the insulin-stimulated state of 3T3-L1 adipo-
cytes. These data are consistent with a previous report,
which speculated that telmisartan induces glucose trans-
porter type 4 (GLUT4) expression and subsequent glucose
uptake via peroxisome proliferator activated receptor

(PPAR) activation in adipocytes.12 Enhancement of
GLUT4 expression and PPAR activation can facilitate
lipid accumulation in the process of 3T3-L1 cell differen-
tiation from preadipocytes to adipocytes.12 During the in
vitro studies, evidence has suggested that PPAR activa-
tion increases body weight and causes a shift in the fat
distribution from visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue.13
Telmisartan is effective at reducing body weight and adi-
posity14 and can prevent thiazolidine (PPAR agonist)-
induced weight gain without interfering with its
insulin-sensitizing properties.15 In human studies, tel-
misartan has also been proven to reduce fat content and
affect fat distribution in individuals with the metabolic
syndrome.16 These facts raise a question regarding the dif-
ferential effects of telmisartan and thiazolidine, both
PPAR agonists, on body weight and adiposity. Some
investigators hold the view that reduction of body weight
is associated with reduction of food intake and a down-
regulation of orexigenic peptides after AT1-blockage.17,18
Others presume that it is a direct effect of angiotensin
receptor blockers (ARBs) on the lipid metabolisms in the
liver and/or the adipose tissue.19 In the present study, we
observed the effect of telmisartan on the lipid metabolisms
of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and provided evidence
that the telmisartan has direct impact on the adipocytes,
reduces lipid storage and increases FFA secretion from the
cells. Thereafter the possible mechanisms were explored
by the microarray, which showed that telmisartan affected
the MAPK signaling pathway and gene expressions of
Nos3 and CPT1 during the reduction of lipid storage.
Local endothelial nitric oxide synthetase can increase the
nitric oxide synthesis of adipocytes and also regulates
energy metabolism via influencing mitochondrial biogen-
esis20 and lipolysis.21 Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A is
the key regulatory enzyme of the long-chain fatty acid
enzyme of -oxidation. Recent studies suggest that a mod-
erate increase in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A activity
is sufficient to substantially reduce hepatic triglyceride
levels. Overexpression of CPT1 increased the rate of
-oxidation and was accompanied by a significant reduc-
tion in triglyceride accumulation by hepatocytes which
have potential benefits in the treatment of fatty liver.22 In
adipocytes, it is known that increasing the expression of
CPT1 can also enhance the fatty acid oxidation.23
Abuissa et al.,1 in a meta-analysis of 12 recent rand-
omized controlled clinical trials that enrolled patients
with hypertension, chronic heart failure or coronary heart
disease, showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors and ARBs produced a highly significant
25% reduction in the incidence of new-onset diabetes
when compared with placebo, diuretics, beta-blockers or
calcium channel antagonists. However, these mechanisms
are not fully understood. Our experiment suggests that the
adipocyte is one of the major targets for telmisartan, and
the actions of reducing proinflammatory factors from
adipocyte, increasing glucose uptake and decreasing the
lipid content of adipocytes may enhance the beneficial
metabolic effects of telmisartan. Collectively, the present
findings of our experiments indicate that telmisartan may
be involved in regulation of adipose mass and secretion of
adipocytes. Local effects of telmisartan on the adipocytes
could thus be expected to change the factors known to
regulate adipocyte metabolism. Additional studies will be
necessary to determine whether there are similar effects of
telmisartan on regulation of lipid metabolisms and proin-
flammatory factors secretion in vivo.
Conclusions
Telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, affected
lipometabolisms and the proinflammatory factors secreted
from adipocytes. Our research revealed that Nos3, CPT1
and the MAPK pathway affected by telmisartan may be
the underlying cause of the improvement in the lipid
metabolisms and proinflammatory factors affecting the
secretion of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
