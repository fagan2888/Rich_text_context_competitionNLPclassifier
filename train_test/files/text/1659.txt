RECENTLY, researchers have reported that adults should
be obtaining adequate amounts of water if they respond
to their thirst signals (1). However, one water recommenda-
tion may not be appropriate for all age groups (2). Both in-
sufficient water intake and increased water excretion make
aged individuals susceptible to dehydration. Consequently,
some researchers contend that promoting adequate fluid in-
take is the most important modifiable health behavior for
ensuring fluid homeostasis in older adults (3).
Age-related changes in behavior and health status predis-
pose all older adults (65 years) to dehydration (4,5). Many
older adults deliberately avoid drinking beverages because
they fear nighttime incontinence (6). In addition, older
adults may not recognize that they are thirsty as the sensa-
tion of thirst decreases with age, probably due to changes in
the activity of osmoreceptors (7). Although it is difficult to
examine the effects of aging independently of chronic dis-
ease, research suggests that aging is associated with kidney
atrophy, decreased cortical blood flow and glomerular filtra-
tion rate, and diminished maximal urinary concentrating
capacity (8,9). These changes can lead to electrolyte imbal-
ances and enhanced water diuresis (10). Often, dehydration
is cited as a reason for emergency room visits and as a second-
ary diagnosis for hospitalization in the elderly; however, oth-
erscontendthatdehydrationmaybemisdiagnosedinlong-term
care patients (11­13). Unchecked dehydration can cause
changes in body chemistry, kidney failure, kidney stones, uri-
nary tract infections, bowel cancer, and death (14­18).
Despite the consequences of poor hydration, very little
attention has been devoted to the measurement of total daily
water intake of community-dwelling older adults (19). Stud-
ies reported include those with area-specific populations
(20), limited sample size (21), or middle-aged participants
(50 years) included in the analysis (22). Other researchers
have examined total water intake in countries other than the
United States, particularly Germany and Hungary (3,23,
24). To our knowledge, estimates of total water intake for
three older adult age groups, including the oldest-old
(85 years), from a national U.S. sample have not been
reported.
Using a national sample of independent, community-
living older adults, we evaluated differences in total water
intake for three older age groups (65­74, 75­84, and
85 years). The relative contributions of drinking water,
beverages, and food sources to total water intake were de-
termined for these older age groups. Differences in water
intakes from beverages at meals versus beverages at snack
occasions were also evaluated. Finally, the time of day that
the beverages were consumed and the major beverage
sources of water for each age group were identified.

Background. Literature reporting total daily water intake of community-dwelling older adults is limited. We evaluated
differences in total water intake, water sources, water from meal and snack beverages, timing of beverage consumption,
and beverage selection for three older age groups (young-old, 65­74 years; middle-old, 75­84 years; and oldest-old, 85
years).
Methods. Data for 2,054 older adults from the 1999­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were
used for this study. Multivariate analyses controlling for age, sex, race­ethnicity, education, and marital status were con-
ducted to determine differences in water intake variables across the age groups.
Results. Total water intakes found for the middle-old and oldest-old age groups were significantly lower than those
found for the young-old age group. The relative contributions of beverages to total water intake were 40.8%, 38.3%, and
36.4% for the young-old, middle-old, and oldest-old, respectively. The water intakes from beverages consumed at snack
occasions were significantly lower for the middle-old and oldest-old groups than those for the young-old group. All
groups consumed the greatest amount of water in the morning. Coffee was the predominant source of water from bever-
ages for all groups.
Conclusions. This study fills a gap in the literature by providing an analysis of the daily water intake of middle-old
and oldest-old adults. We found that the total water intake for the middle-old and oldest-old was significantly lower than
that for the young-old. Future research needs to investigate the clinical outcomes associated with declining water intakes
of community-dwelling older adults.

Methods
Data Set
The data source was the U.S. Federal Government's Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
for 1999­2002, which provides information on American
health, demographic, socioeconomic, and food and nutrient
consumption characteristics. NHANES 1999­2002 is a
complex, multistage probability sample of the civilian, non-
institutionalized population of the United States. Although
individuals of all ages were sampled, we selected those re-
spondents who were 65 years or older (N = 2,054) at the
time of their interview. Statistical weights were applied to
make the sample representative of the U.S. population.
Dietary Assessment
For the 1999­2002 NHANES, individual dietary intakes
were collected for 1 day. Although the reliability of total
water intake measurements has not been reported, research-
ers have indicated that food intake data using a 1-day di-
etary recall are reliable measures of the usual intakes of
energy, macronutrients, and several micronutrients of popu-
lation groups (25). Data were collected with the Automated
Multiple-Pass Method, a five-step computer-assisted inter-
view that has been validated with doubly labeled water and
investigator-observed food intakes (26­28). Specific probes
were used to collect detailed information about each food
and beverage item and the amount consumed. Respondents
were asked to report the time each food and beverage was
eaten and what they would call the eating occasion (e.g.,
meal vs snack) for that item. Following the 24-hour recall,
respondents were asked to estimate their plain drinking wa-
ter consumption during the previous 24-hour period.
In this analysis, total water intake is defined as the sum of
the amount of drinking water consumed and the amount of
water consumed from food and beverage sources (NHANES
total nutrient intake file). The coding and nutrient calcula-
tions of the 24-hour recall were detailed elsewhere (29, 30).
Total water intake is presented as grams, grams per kilo-
gram body weight, and grams per 1,000 calories. Total wa-
ter intakes (g) were compared with the Adequate Intake
(AI) recommendations (3,700 g for men and 2,700 g for
women) (2).
To determine the contribution of water from food and
beverages, the NHANES individual foods file was used.
This file contains detailed information about the type and
amount of individual foods and beverages reported by each
respondent and the amount of water from these foods and
beverages. The United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies
1.0 was used to identify beverages in the individual foods
file (the specific USDA food codes are available from the
authors). The relative contributions of water (g) from bever-
ages, foods, and plain drinking water were calculated.
The specification of snack and meal occasions was de-
scribed elsewhere (31). The individual foods file contains
the time each beverage was consumed. The relative contri-
bution of beverages to water intake was calculated for four
time blocks in a 24-hour period: (i) midnight to 4:59 am, (ii)
5:00 am to 12:59 pm, (iii) 1:00 pm to 6:59 pm, and (iv) 7:00 pm
to 11:59 pm.
Statistical Software and Analysis
Data manipulation was conducted using SAS software
(Version 9.1, 2005; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The
NHANES are multistage, stratified area probability sam-
ples. To account for sample design and sampling weights,
we used STATA (Version 10; College Station, TX) to esti-
mate descriptive and inferential statistics (32).
Linear regression models controlling for gender, race­
ethnicity, education, and marital status were used to exam-
ine the association between age and total water intake and
between age and water intake from beverages consumed at
meal and snack occasions.
Age groups are defined as young-old (65­74 years),
middle-old (75­84 years), and oldest-old (85 years). Race­
ethnicity information included Mexican Americans, other
Hispanics, non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and
other race. Because of the small sample sizes, Mexican
Americans and other Hispanics were combined to form
Hispanics, and the other race was combined with non-
Hispanic Whites. The level of education was defined as less
than a high school degree or greater than or equal to a high
school degree. The married group also included those who
reported living with their partner. The single group included
those who were widowed, separated, or never married.
Results
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study population.
The total water intake for both the middle-old (p < .001,
p = .019, and p = .027 for g, g/kg, or g/1,000 kcal, respec-
tively) and the oldest-old (p < .001, p = .040, and p = .032
for g, g/kg, or g/1,000 kcal, respectively) was significantly
lower than that for the young-old (Table 2). When compared
with the AI, we found that 37%, 27%, and 19% of the
young-old, middle-old, and oldest-old, respectively, met or
exceeded their AI.
The relative contributions of beverages to total water in-
take were 40.8%, 38.3%, and 36.4% for the young-old,
middle-old, and oldest-old, respectively. The relative contri-
butions of plain drinking water to total water intake were
38.1%, 39.4%, and 39.5% and the water contributions of
foods were 21.1%, 22.2%, and 24.2% for the young-old,
middle-old, and oldest-old, respectively. Because we found
an age-related decrease in the relative contribution of bever-
ages to total water intake, our subsequent analysis focused
on beverages.
WATER INTAKES OF OLDER ADULTS 483
Table 3 shows the water intakes from beverages con-
sumed during snack and meal occasions. Water intake from
beverages consumed at meal occasions did not differ sig-
nificantly for the middle-old (p = .172) or the oldest-old
(p = .057) compared with the young-old. However, the water
intake from beverages consumed at snack occasions was
significantly lower for both the middle-old (p < .001) and
the oldest-old (p < .001) compared with the young-old.
Water intakes from beverages consumed during the
24-hour period are presented in Table 4. We found similar
consumption patterns in the three age groups. All elderly
consumed the greatest amount of water early in the day
(5:00 am to 12:59 pm). Thereafter, water consumption de-
creased with the time of day: Less water was consumed in
the afternoon (1:00 pm to 6:59 pm) and still less in the eve-
ning (7:00 pm to 11:59 pm). Little water was consumed by
any group between midnight to 4:59 am.
The major beverage contributors to water intakes are pre-
sented in Figure 1. Coffee was the predominant beverage
source of water for all three groups. Although soft drinks
were the second leading source of water for the young-old,
milk beverages were the second leading source for the
middle-old and oldest-old. The third leading sources of water
were the milk beverages group, the soft drinks group, and
the tea group for the young-old, the middle-old, and the
oldest-old, respectively.
Discussion
This study fills a gap in the literature by defining the wa-
ter intakes of a nationally representative sample of middle-
old and oldest-old adults. Results from this study indicate
that total water intakes appear to decrease with age. This
decrease is observed even when considering body weight
and caloric intake. Contrary to our results, two smaller area-
specific studies found no differences in fluid intake between
younger and older adults (21,33). However, neither study
included participants in the oldest-old age group. Compa-
rable with our study, but using a representative sample of
older German adults, Volkert and colleagues (3) reported
that total daily water intake and daily beverage intake de-
creased with age and found that those 85 years or older had
the lowest water intakes. Using hydrogen-labeled water,
Raman and colleagues (34) found that water from ingested
foods and beverages did not differ significantly among age
groups until the eighth decade of life. In a smaller British

study, researchers reported that average daily water intakes
of community-living older adults (69­88 years) were lower
than those found in younger populations (35).
As expected from the total water intakes, the proportion
of study participants meeting their AI was the lowest in the
oldest-old group. AI is based on the intakes of healthy indi-
viduals who appear to be adequately hydrated; however,
individuals can be adequately hydrated at lower or higher
levels. However, having so few study participants meeting
their AI warrants further investigation.
The credibility of the "8 × 8" (eight 8 ounce glasses daily)
water recommendation has been questioned (36). No single
measure completely discriminates between dehydrated and
nondehydrated individuals (5). Lindeman and colleagues
(20) suggested that eight glasses of liquid a day may be in-
appropriate and actually may contribute to incontinence
and/or water overload. More recently, Negoianu and Gold-
farb (1) questioned the validity of the commonly held belief
that adults should drink eight glasses of water per day. Over-
all, there has been little research to measure the fluid intake
of community-dwelling older adults, and fluid intake rec-
ommendations for all adults should be evidence based (19).
Thus, our aim was to provide a population-level assessment
of water intake to assist in the development of evidence-
based fluid intake recommendations for older adults.
There were interesting differences between the water con-
tributions of meal and snack beverages. The water intake from
beverages consumed as snacks decreased significantly as the
age of the population increased. The role of snacking in a
healthful diet has been questioned (31). Our results suggest
that the consumption of beverages during snack occasions
may play an important role in maintaining fluid homeostasis.
There were also differences in the timing of beverage
consumption; most beverages were consumed in the morn-
ing, whereas few were consumed at night. This finding, and
that of De Castro, supports the claim that older adults may
deliberately avoid drinking in the evening in order to avoid
nighttime incontinence (6,21).
Although there has been a clear societal trend toward
soda consumption and away from milk consumption (37),
we found that milk beverages were the second leading
source of water for the middle-old and oldest-old and that
soft drinks were the second leading source of water for the
young-old. Some have suggested that these differences may
be a cohort effect rather than an effect of aging (21). How-
ever, this may be an actual behavior change associated with
aging. Jungjohann and colleagues (23) found that elderly
men drank significantly fewer soft drinks than the same
men did when they were younger. Researchers examining
total diet quality have shown that dietary behaviors become
more health promoting as individuals age (38).
Coffee and tea consumption were common in our study
population. Many health professionals advise individuals to
avoid coffee and teas because they contain caffeine and re-
lated methylxanthine compounds (39). It is commonly be-
lieved that these beverages may trigger dehydration because
of their diuretic effects (3). However, Maughan and Griffin

(39) found little evidence supporting this hypothesis. The
authors noted that little is known about the influence of age
and gender on the diuretic effect of caffeine. However, rec-
ommendations for older adults to decrease caffeine con-
sumption may be appropriate considering its other stimulant
effects and the potential for drug interactions.
One drawback to this analysis is the use of only one
24-hour dietary recall interview. Water intake may vary
from day to day. In addition, underreporting issues can
be an issue with self-reported data such as a 24-hour
dietary recall interview. In a study that examined under-
reporting issues, the results obtained from 30-year-olds
were significantly different than those obtained from
older age groups (40-, 50-, and 60-year-olds), but differ-
ences were not found when comparisons were made be-
tween the older three age groups (40). All our participants
were noninstitutionalized; however, there may be the
possibility of cognitive impairment in these participants,
and this would affect their ability to recall their diet.
Another drawback is that we were unable to control for
environmental variables (geographical location, season-
ality) that could influence water intakes. The AI is for
individuals living in temperate climates; thus, we may
have misclassified individuals residing in warm climates.
With our analysis, we are unable to determine the clini-
cal significance of the observed decrease in water intake.
A review of literature in the dietary reference intakes
report suggests that increased total water intake may be
effective therapy to prevent recurrent kidney stones, gall-
stones, distal colon tumors, and bladder cancer (41).
An advantage of our study is that we used a nationally
representative sample that allows us to generalize to the
U.S. population. Another advantage is that we were able to
examine adults 85 year or older. Finally, a 24-hour dietary
recall allowed us to describe behaviors affecting beverage
intake such as timing and beverage selection, which are
important considerations when trying to implement be-
havior change.
Our results suggest that water intakes, particularly the
contribution from beverages, appear to decline with age.
Future research needs to investigate the clinical outcomes
associated with declining water intakes of community-
dwelling older adults. Identifying the associations between
water intakes and clinical outcomes will also assist in evalu-
ating and determining evidence-based water intake recom-
mendations for older adults.
