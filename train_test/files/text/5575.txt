Working memory refers to the idea that there is a general
capacity-limited system (or set of systems) responsible for
the storage and manipulation of information in the human
mind. In the last few years, studies of working memory
training have bourgeoned. In this article, we review the
background on working memory training and provide a
meta-analytic review of the many studies in this field. Our
conclusion is that there is no good evidence that working
memory training improves intelligence test scores or other
measures of "real-world" cognitive skills. We finish with
some recommendations for future research.

Abstract
It has been claimed that working memory training programs produce diverse beneficial effects. This article presents
a meta-analysis of working memory training studies (with a pretest-posttest design and a control group) that have
examined transfer to other measures (nonverbal ability, verbal ability, word decoding, reading comprehension, or
arithmetic; 87 publications with 145 experimental comparisons). Immediately following training there were reliable
improvements on measures of intermediate transfer (verbal and visuospatial working memory). For measures of far
transfer (nonverbal ability, verbal ability, word decoding, reading comprehension, arithmetic) there was no convincing
evidence of any reliable improvements when working memory training was compared with a treated control condition.
Furthermore, mediation analyses indicated that across studies, the degree of improvement on working memory
measures was not related to the magnitude of far-transfer effects found. Finally, analysis of publication bias shows that
there is no evidential value from the studies of working memory training using treated controls. The authors conclude
that working memory training programs appear to produce short-term, specific training effects that do not generalize
to measures of "real-world" cognitive skills. These results seriously question the practical and theoretical importance
of current computerized working memory programs as methods of training working memory skills.

The Foundation of Working
Memory Training
The rationale for working memory training developed
from suggestions that limitations in working memory
capacity may have wide-reaching effects on other aspects
of cognition. For example, according to one theory varia-
tions in fluid intelligence reflect to a large degree varia-
tions in working memory capacity (Engle, 2002; but see
Heitz et al., 2006). Others have argued that limitations in
working memory capacity may be responsible for impair-
ments in the development of reading (Swanson, 2006),
language (Archibald & Gathercole, 2006), and mathemat-
ical skills (Passolunghi, 2006). The idea that working
memory limitations may place constraints on diverse higher
cognitive functions leads directly to the suggestion that if
working memory capacity can be increased by training, this
should produce transfer effects to diverse untrained tasks
that depend on such a capacity (Shipstead, Redick, &
Engle, 2010).
A specific example makes the approach clearer. In a
pioneering study, Klingberg, Forssberg, and Westerberg
(2002) assessed whether they could improve working
memory capacity by training and whether this, in turn,
would produce improvements on other cognitive tasks.
The participants were children diagnosed with attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Children in the
working memory training group were given computer-
ized training on three working memory tasks (visuospa-
tial span, backward digit span, letter-span) and a choice
reaction time task. For each of the working memory
training tasks, the difficulty level for the trained group
was adjusted adaptively across trials by changing the
number of stimuli to be remembered in response to the
participant's performance. The logic of such an adaptive
training regime is that it makes the task challenging and
ensures that participants are performing at the limits of
their working memory capacity. Participants in the trained
group were required to complete 30 trials on each task
each day (roughly 25 min training per day) for a total of
24 days of training, giving a total training dose of roughly
10 hr spread over 5 to 6 weeks. Participants in the control
group performed easy versions of the same tasks where
the difficulty level was fixed to a low level in each task.
However, children in the control group only did 10 trials
per session on each task and had less contact with the
experimenter than the children in the treatment group.
Klingberg et al. (2002) reported that working memory
training improved performance in comparison to the con-
trol group on a variety of tasks, including measures
directly trained (visuospatial working memory) and tasks
similar to those trained (span board, another visual memory
task). More surprisingly, they also reported significant
increases in scores on a standardized measure of intelli-
gence (Raven's progressive matrices) after working memory
training. This is an example of far transfer--improvement
on a task that is seemingly remote from the tasks that
have been trained. The claim that playing a set of com-
puter games for roughly 10 hr can improve a child's intel-
ligence test scores is provocative and has led many others
to try to confirm such an effect.
This study proved highly influential (and formed the
basis of the popular commercial working memory train-
ing program CogMed; www.cogmed.com). However,
there are some obvious weaknesses in this study: The
group sizes (7 children per group) are tiny--this study is,
like many other studies in this area, severely underpow-
ered. Another problem with the design of this study is
that any differences found as a result of training may
reflect differences in the duration of the computerized
tasks performed by the two groups, rather than being
effects of adaptive working memory training, per se. Nev-
ertheless, if the claim that working memory training
improves intelligence test scores could be confirmed and
substantiated it would have potentially important impli-
cations for education and economic productivity, as well
as for theories about the nature and limitations of human
cognitive abilities. Because studies in this area are gener-
ally underpowered, summarizing them in a meta-analysis
may be valuable as a way of clarifying the conclusions
that can be drawn from the many inconsistent findings.
Prior Reviews of Working Memory
Training
In this article, we report an updated meta-analysis of cur-
rent evidence for the effectiveness of working memory
training. We focus on two key issues: (a) Does working
memory training improve the skills directly trained? (b) If
so, does such training transfer to improve other skills
such as intelligence test performance? Recently, there
have been many working memory training studies that
have been summarized in several qualitative and quanti-
tative reviews, with seemingly conflicting conclusions
(see Appendix in the Supplemental Materials available
online for references to other reviews and meta-analyses
of interest).
Melby-Lervåg and Hulme (2013) reported a meta-anal-
ysis of all 23 published studies (at the date of their review)
of working memory training in both adults and children.
They found evidence that the training programs produced
reliable short-term improvements in working memory
skills. However, these improvements in working memory
skills did not appear to be maintained a few weeks after
training had ended. Furthermore, there was no convinc-
ing evidence of generalization from working memory
training to other skills (nonverbal and verbal ability, inhib-
itory processes in attention, word reading, and arithme-
tic). They concluded that working memory training
programs appear to produce short-term effects that do
514 Melby-Lervåg et al.
not generalize to tasks that have not been directly trained.
Clearly, the most critical issue, theoretically and practi-
cally, is whether or not working memory training pro-
duces far-transfer effects (Barnett & Ceci, 2002; 
Taatgen,
2013), for which our previous review (Melby-Lervåg &
Hulme, 2013) failed to find any convincing evidence. These
findings of small immediate effects with no reliable effects
at follow-up have also been replicated by Schwaighofer,
Fischer, and Buhner (2015).
Recently, two meta-analyses have claimed that working
memory training can be effective in enhancing cognitive
skills in adulthood (Au et al., 2014) and stemming cogni-
tive decline in old age (Karbach & Verhaeghen, 2014).
However, the conclusions from these articles can be ques-
tioned because of the following: (a) The failure to take
account of baseline differences when calculating effect
sizes is of great importance, because relying only on post-
test differences can cause biased effect-size estimates,
especially in a field with small sample sizes and studies
that have imbalance at baseline; (b) the failure to base
conclusions on studies that include treated control groups,
because only these studies provide adequate control for
nonspecific effects (such as familiarity with being assessed
on a computer) that may arise in computerized working
memory training studies; and (c) the merging of measures
such as reading comprehension and executive measures
into one far-transfer construct. Melby-Lervåg and Hulme
(2016) reanalyzed the studies from these two meta-analy-
ses and concluded that there was no convincing evidence
that working memory training produces general cognitive
benefits (see also Dougherty, Hamovitz, & Tidwell, 2016).
However, recently there have been other meta-analyses of
working memory and cognitive training concluding that it
is effective for specific age/patient groups (Karr,

Areshenkoff, Rast, & 
Garcia-Barrera, 2014; Kelly, Loughrey,
& Lawlor, 2014; Spencer-Smith & Klingberg, 2015; Weicker,
Villringer, & Thöne-Otto, 2016).
Previous reviews seem to show conflicting findings for
two main reasons: First, some methodological decisions
may have led to biased conclusions (see Melby-Lervåg &
Hulme, 2016). Second, previous reviews typically have
examined subsets of studies restricted to specific types of
working memory training, age groups, or participant sta-
tus. An alternative approach is to include as broad a
range of studies as possible and then examine whether
certain study characteristics can explain variations
between them. This is the approach adopted here. We
have identified a total of 87 publications with 145 differ-
ent experimental comparisons (up from 23 publications
with 30 experimental comparisons identified by Melby-
Lervåg & Hulme, 2013, and from 47 studies with 65
experimental comparisons identified by Schwaighofer
et al. (2015), which is a considerably larger number than
all other reviews in this field. We have designed our
review to be as inclusive as possible to reach a clear
statement as to what conclusions are justified by current
evidence in this contentious field.
Also, in this review we will pay particular attention to
possible effects of publication bias using a novel method,
p-curve analysis (Simonsohn, Nelson, & Simmons, 2014).
In the past few years, there has been much attention paid
to issues of replicability in psychology (e.g., Ioannidis,
2012; Open Science Collaboration, 2015; Pashler & Harris,
2012). By analyzing publication bias in more detail, we
can get a better understanding of how it can affect a field
when one study shows a newsworthy finding with an
extremely large effect size (as in the study by Klingberg
et al., 2002). Our analysis using p-curves provides evi-
dence of publication bias in studies of working memory
training.
The Current Review
The current meta-analysis focuses on four interrelated
questions:
1. Does working memory training improve perfor-
mance on working memory tasks (i.e., produce
improvements on the tasks trained and on visuo-
spatial and verbal working memory tasks)?
2. Does working memory training improve perfor-
mance on tests of nonverbal skills (particularly
measures of nonverbal reasoning, such as Raven's
matrices)?
3. Does working memory training improve perfor-
mance on tests of verbal skills (verbal ability, word
decoding, reading comprehension, and arithmetic)?
4. Is there a relationship between intermediate-trans-
fer and far-transfer effects (i.e., if training produces
improvements on measures of working memory,
are improvements on more distant measures of
transfer such as nonverbal reasoning proportional
to the improvements found in working memory)?
Question 1 addresses whether training is effective in
improving performance on measures that are identical or
closely related to tasks that have been trained (near-
transfer measures). Questions 2 and 3 address aspects of
far transfer; more specifically, they are relevant to per-
haps the most provocative claim for working memory
training--that it can increase scores on measures of intel-
ligence and attainment. Question 4 addresses the mecha-
nisms responsible for possible far-transfer effects.
Theoretically, such far-transfer effects are only expected
in the presence of improvements in working memory
capacity, because effects of working memory training on
fluid intelligence or academic attainment are typically
seen as being mediated by (i.e., dependent on) increases
in working memory capacity (Harrison et al., 2013; Lange
& Süß, 2015; Tidwell, Dougherty, Chrabaszcz, Thomas, &
Working Memory Training on Intelligence Measures 515
Mendoza, 2014; von Bastian & Oberauer, 2014). If work-
ing memory training studies find increases in fluid intel-
ligence or attainment in the absence of increases in
working memory capacity, this pattern would be difficult
to explain theoretically. It would have to be argued, for
example, that the component of intelligence that is
improved by working memory training is different from
the components of intelligence that are dependent on
working memory capacity.
The four questions outlined above are critical for any
attempt to assess evidence for the effectiveness of work-
ing memory training. However, in reaching a satisfactory
answer to these broad questions, a number of method-
ological issues need to be taken into account. One poten-
tially critical factor is the type of activity to which the
control group is exposed (Boot, Simons, Stothart, &
Stutts, 2013; Buschkuehl & Jaeggi, 2010; Melby-Lervåg &
Hulme, 2013; Shipstead, Hicks, & Engle, 2012). We have
categorized studies into those with untreated controls
(i.e., where the control group receives no intervention)
or treated controls (i.e., where the control group receives
a non-working memory training intervention of a similar
type and of equivalent intensity and duration). Arguably,
only studies with treated control groups can provide con-
vincing evidence of specific benefits from working mem-
ory training. If a study only has an untreated control
group, any effects of training could arise from quite gen-
eral effects--for example, familiarity with computerized
tasks, additional contact with the experimenter (demand
characteristics), and motivational differences related to
belief about the study purpose (expectancy effects)
rather than effects on working memory processes, per se.
Because untreated control conditions are likely to overes-
timate the true size of any training effect, they are poten-
tially most useful for preliminary evaluations of novel
effects, but not for understanding causal mechanisms or
evaluating whether a treatment offers an improvement
over current practice (see Mohr et al., 2009, for a review).
Thus, if there are true effects of training, this should be
apparent both in studies using treated controls and in
studies using untreated controls. For these reasons, we
will analyze studies with untreated controls separately
from those with only treated controls, and our discussion
and interpretation of the meta-analytic results will largely
focus on analyses of studies with treated controls.
Studies of working memory training also differ on
numerous other dimensions that potentially may affect the
results of training. Therefore, we will conduct analyses to
examine whether training effects differ according to:
1. The age of participants. On the basis of ideas about
brain plasticity (Buschkuehl, Jaeggi, & Jonides,
2012), some researchers have suggested that indi-
viduals at different ages may be more receptive to
benefits from working memory training (Lövdén,
Bäckman, Lindenberger, Schaefer, & Schmiedek,
2010). This finding could take the form of working
memory training being more effective for children or
young adults relative to older adults, although other
research (Zinke et al., 2014) indicates that age may
moderate working memory training gains even
within the older population.
2. The duration or dose of training received. One of
the first working memory training studies (Jaeggi,
Buschkuehl, Jonides, & Perrig, 2008) reported that
the amount of transfer to fluid intelligence was
dependent on the number of training sessions
completed. Working memory training studies have
varied widely in terms of training duration, which
may account for some of the variation in transfer
observed between studies.
3. Learner status. Under the assumption that individ-
uals who have cognitive impairments (e.g., ADHD,
dyslexia, low working memory, or other neuropsy-
chological disorders) may be more receptive to
benefits from working memory training, we sepa-
rated studies according to whether participants
were selected for having a learning difficulty. Sta-
tistically, individuals with lower cognitive abilities
before training may have more room for improve-
ment, and thus training and transfer might be more
effective for these individuals relative to healthy,
typically developing participants.
4. Study design. We examined whether studies used
random allocation of participants to conditions. Tra-
ditionally, it has been argued that random allocation
of participants to conditions is the surest way of
ensuring that the results of an intervention reflect
a causal effect (Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002).
However, meta-analyses indicate that under some
circumstances, data from nonrandomized experi-
ments may yield similar estimates of effect size
to those from randomized experiments (e.g.,
Heinsman & Shadish, 1996; Shadish & Ragsdale,
1996). The analyses presented later will examine this
issue further.
5. Publication bias. Several studies have found that
intervention studies are particularly vulnerable to
publication bias and for lacking replicability
(
Cuijpers, Smit, Hollon, & Andersson, 2010;
Scherer, Langenberg, & von Elm, 2007). Here, we
will pay particular attention to this, both by retriev-
ing as much grey literature as possible (see

Rothstein, Sutton, & Borenstein, 2005) and by esti-
mating the impact of publication bias using statis-
tical procedures. Studies from the grey literature
were retrieved through electronic database
searches, by e-mailing researchers in the field, and
by attending conferences and asking for posters/
unpublished material (see Fig. 1).

Working Memory Training on Intelligence Measures 517
6. Type of working memory training program.
Numerous training programs have been used in
working memory training studies. For example,
the commercial CogMed program includes vari-
ous versions of verbal and visuospatial memory
span tasks. Other commonly used working mem-
ory training programs include: (a) running mem-
ory span tasks, where participants must recall in
order only a specified number of items at the end
of a long list of stimuli; and (b) complex memory
span tasks, where the participant completes a dis-
tractor processing task interleaved with to-be-
remembered stimuli within the span task. Finally,
variations of the N-back task have been used fre-
quently; in these tasks participants indicate
whether or not the currently presented stimulus
matches one that was presented n stimuli back in
a list (e.g., Jaeggi et al., 2008). The different types
of working memory training tasks used could
account for the variation in results across studies
and is examined here as a potential moderator. In
addition, the stimulus content (verbal, visuospa-
tial, or both) of the working memory training pro-
grams was coded.
In summary, we present a meta-analysis to synthesize evi-
dence from all studies of working memory training (both
published and unpublished) that we have been able to
identify. We will focus particularly on evidence for the
most provocative claim of working memory training (that
it improves intelligence), though we will also consider
other claims, particularly those concerning generalized
improvements on untrained measures of both verbal and
visuospatial working memory. This study will clarify previ-
ous working memory training meta-analyses. We will pro-
vide more fine-grained analyses of several different
outcomes, analyzing follow-up effects and controlling for
baseline differences, while examining multiple working
memory training programs (in contrast to Au et al., 2014)
and including participants across the entire life span (in
contrast to Au et al., 2014, and Karbach & Verhaeghen,
2014). In contrast to Melby-Lervåg and Hulme (2013) and
Schwaighofer et al. (2015), we have a considerably larger
sample of studies, providing us much more robust esti-
mates of effect size and allowing us to perform moderator
analyses that have more power (Hedges & Pigott, 2004).
Further, in comparison to Melby-Lervåg and Hulme (2013)
and Schwaighofer et al. (2015), we will also provide a
more fine-grained analysis of working memory measures
and publication bias. Critically, we will use mediation
models to examine whether differences among the studies
in terms of gains in working memory are related to differ-
ences in gains on the transfer measures.
Method
This meta-analysis was designed in line with the state-
ment for systematic reviews developed by PRISMA (Pre-
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses, www.prisma-statement.org).
Search, inclusion criteria and coding
The literature search, criteria for inclusion and exclusion
and flow of studies are shown in Figure 1. Only studies
that had a control group and a training group with pretest
and posttest measures before and after working memory
training were included in the review. Our decision as to
whether a study trained working memory was guided by
previous research examining the factor structure of work-
ing memory measures (see Ackerman, Beier, & Boyle,
2005; Engle, Tuholski, Laughlin, & Conway, 1999;

Gathercole, Pickering, Ambridge, & Wearing, 2004; Kane
et al., 2004; Schmiedek et al., 2009). For a study to be
included, the training had to involve tasks that typically
have been found to load on working memory in latent-
variable studies. Examples include visuospatial and verbal
versions of simple span (forward and backward), complex
span, running span, updating (e.g., keep track), and N-back
(single and dual). In cases where an intervention had mul-
tiple components, the working memory tasks had to consti-
tute at least 50% of the intervention. Studies based purely on
training task-switching, inhibition, or reasoning were
excluded in an attempt to isolate the construct being trained
as working memory and not other potentially related con-
structs (e.g., executive functioning). We included only stud-
ies of computerized working memory training.
The studies examined could be randomized or quasi-
experiments, but they had to include tests of either non-
verbal ability, verbal ability, reading comprehension,
word decoding, or arithmetic as outcome measures. We
also included verbal and visuospatial working memory
outcomes, but only if the study included one of the far-
transfer constructs. Measures of problem solving without
a clear reliance on language were coded as nonverbal
ability tests (common examples include Raven's progres-
sive matrices and the Cattell Culture Fair test). Measures
of verbal ability were largely tests of receptive or expres-
sive vocabulary knowledge, along with reasoning based
on alphanumeric content (e.g., Letter Sets, Number
Series). Measures that involved text reading with subse-
quent questions about the meaning of a passage were
classified as reading comprehension tests. Measures of
word decoding included tests of the accuracy or fluency
of word or nonword reading. Arithmetic measures
included tasks involving addition, subtraction, multiplica-
tion, or division. Near-transfer measures were tests that
518 Melby-Lervåg et al.
were similar or identical to the tasks trained. For working
memory measures, we distinguished between measures
of verbal and visuospatial working memory (where the
participant had to remember verbal or visuospatial mate-
rial, respectively). Simple memory span tests such as digit
span were excluded from the analyses if only the forward
version was administered, unless the forward-only ver-
sion of the task was considered a criterion measure that
was identical to a training task. If the backward version
of a simple span task was administered separately, or a
combined score for the forward and backward versions
was reported, the outcome was included as well.
We separated the measures into three different catego-
ries: (a) near-transfer measures (tests that were similar or
identical to the tasks trained), (b) intermediate-transfer
measures (verbal and visuospatial working memory mea-
sures), and (c) far-transfer measures (measures that dif-
fered substantially from those trained, i.e. nonverbal
ability, verbal ability, reading comprehension, word
decoding, or arithmetic).
We also took steps to account for the nonindependence
of effect sizes from the same or different studies. Violating
the assumption of independence by computing an overall
effect size based on information from the same sample
more than once can lead to biased estimates (Borenstein
et al., 2009). For this reason studies from the same author
were examined to detect duplicate samples, and studies
based on the same participants were only coded once (see
Fig. 1 for detailed information). When a study had multiple
indicators for the same construct (for instance more than
one measure of verbal working memory) the mean of the
indicators was used to yield a single effect size for that
study. Finally, some studies compare the same control
group to different experimental groups and are included
in the same analysis of a mean effect size for treated and
untreated controls. Because the correlations between the
multiple comparisons and their outcomes are not reported
in the original studies reviewed, we included these studies
in the analyses, assuming zero correlation between the
outcomes. Note, however, that we also did analyses where
we combined the different treatment groups into one in
these studies, and this produced essentially identical
results to those reported here.
All the studies were coded by two independent raters.
The interrater correlation (Pearson's) for outcomes was
r = .99, 95% CI [.97, 1], p < .0001, and agreement rate =
97.00%. For the moderators, the agreement rate was 98%.
Any disagreements between raters were resolved by con-
sulting the original article or by discussion.
Meta-analytic procedure and analysis
The analyses were conducted using the "Comprehensive
meta-analysis" program (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, &
Rothstein, 2005). We calculated effect sizes by dividing
the differences in gain between pre- and post-test in the
treatment and the control group by the pooled standard
deviation for each group at pretest; this method of effect-
size calculation for pretest-posttest designs is recom-
mended (Morris, 2008). Thus, when the effect size is
positive, the group receiving working memory training
made greater pretest-posttest gains than the control
group. We adjusted the effect size for small samples using
Hedges's g (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). Effect sizes for fol-
low-up tests were calculated in an analogous way (pre-
test to follow-up).
The mean effect sizes were calculated by a weighted
average of individual effect sizes using a random-effects
model. Because previous meta-analyses have found a
large difference between studies using treated and
untreated controls (Dougherty et al., 2016; Lilienfeld,
Ritschel, Lynn, Cautin, & Latzman, 2014; Melby-Lervåg &
Hulme, 2013), these two designs were analyzed sepa-
rately. Treated controls received computerized training
either based on nonadaptive memory tasks or other tasks
that did not involve memory training but which were of
similar duration to the training received by the interven-
tion group. Untreated controls had no contact other than
completing the pretest, posttest, and follow-up transfer
sessions.
For moderator analyses, studies were separated into
subsets based on the categories in the categorical mod-
erator variable (e.g., children vs. young adults vs. older
adults). A Q test was used to examine whether the effect
sizes differed between subsets. When there were fewer
than four studies in a subset (k < 4), this analysis was not
conducted. The overlap between confidence intervals
was used to examine the size of the difference between
subsets of studies. Because of the limited number of
training studies examining follow-up effects, moderator
analyses were not conducted. In addition, moderator
analyses were not calculated for decoding, reading com-
prehension, and arithmetic, given the limited number of
comparisons for treated and untreated controls.
Publication bias refers to the notion that a mean effect
size can be upwardly biased because only studies with
large or significant effects get published (i.e., file-drawer
problem with entire studies) or that authors only report
data on variables that show effects (often referred to as
p hacking, or the file-drawer problem for parts of studies;
see Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011; Simonsohn
et al., 2014). In line with recommendations for meta-anal-
yses, we made special efforts to retrieve studies from the
grey literature and used this as a moderator when possi-
ble (Higgins & Green, 2011). To estimate the impact from
publication bias statistically, commonly funnel plots have
been used in combination with a trim-and-fill analysis.
However, there are several problems with the funnel
Working Memory Training on Intelligence Measures 519
plot/trim-and-fill method (Lau, Ioannidis, 
Terring, Schmid,
& Olkin, 2006). P-curve is a recently developed method
that deals with the weaknesses in the funnel plot/trim-
and-fill analysis (Simonsohn et al., 2014). A p-curve plots
the distribution of statistically significant p values (p <
.05) in published studies, and the shape of the p-curve is
a function only of the effect size and sample size, when
the power level is taken into account. If there are true
effects, one expects the distribution of published p values
to be right-skewed with more low (.01) than high (.04) p
values. However, if a set of studies is affected by publica-
tion bias (because researchers discard entire studies or
discard analyses or parts of studies), the p-curve becomes
left-skewed or flat. Such a form of p-curve is said to pro-
vide no evidential value (i.e., no support for an appre-
ciable effect size).
When coding articles, it became clear that there were
numerous instances of missing data. If data were critical
to calculate an effect size, articles with missing data were
excluded if authors did not respond to an e-mail request
to provide the data (see inclusion criteria in flow chart).
In cases where an effect size could be computed on one
outcome but data were missing on other outcomes or
moderator variables, the study was included in all the
analyses for which sufficient data were provided.
Moderator variables
Moderators are variables that may explain why different
studies show different results (Pigott, 2012). The follow-
ing moderator variables were used:
Age.The average age of participants in each study was
coded. Because of a nonnormal distribution, it was not pos-
sible to analyze age as a continuous variable. Studies were
therefore separated into three groups: studies of children
(18 years), adults (18­64), and older adults (65 years).
Training dose.The duration of training (total number
of hours in training) was coded. Again, because of a non-
normal distribution, training duration was divided into
discrete bands (studies with a total training duration of
up to 10 hr vs. those with more than 10 hr).
Design type.The procedure for separating participants
into training and control groups was coded (randomized
or nonrandomized).
Learner status.The sampling of participants in the
study was coded: learning disorder (e.g., ADHD, reading,
math, or other learning disorders) or unselected.
Training type.The training programs were split into
four categories: N-back, CogMed, complex span, and
other tasks (which could include combinations of the
four specific types of training listed). There were too few
running span studies to consider them as a separate
category.
Publication type. Each experiment was coded as grey
literature (theses, dissertations, conference posters) or
published studies (journal articles, chapters, peer-
reviewed conference proceeding papers).

Immediate effects of working memory
training on far-transfer measures
Figure 2 shows a summary of the effects of working
memory training on far-transfer measures. In studies with
treated controls, the effects of training on nonverbal abil-
ity, verbal ability, word decoding, and arithmetic are close
to zero and not significant (see Table 1). For reading
comprehension, the effect size for studies with treated
controls is small though significant (g = 0.15). Closer
inspection shows that 10 comparisons with treated con-
trols give small to large positive effects (g = 0.10 to 0.87).
Of these, six comparisons across four studies (Jaeggi,
Buschkuehl, Shah, & Jonides, 2014; Lee, 2014; Redick &
Wiemers, 2015; Shiran & Breznitz, 2011) show an odd
pattern with the control group showing decreases in
reading comprehension from pretest-posttest (see Redick,
2015, for examples of this pattern). This pattern of results
makes these studies very difficult to interpret. Theoreti-
cally, there is no reason to expect decreases in a rela-
tively stable construct such as reading comprehension
ability between pretest and posttest in a control group;
such decreases presumably can only reflect error of mea-
surement. Also, one of these studies (Shiran & Breznitz,
2011) showed large effects compared with the others
(above 3 SDs from the mean effect size). When the com-
parisons with the problematic pretest-to-posttest decline
520 Melby-Lervåg et al.
in the control group are excluded, the effects of working
memory training compared with treated controls for
reading comprehension becomes trivial (g = 0.08) and
similar in magnitude to the other far-transfer outcomes.
As seen in Table 1, even studies using passive controls
did not produce significant effects on verbal abilities,
decoding, and reading comprehension. Thus, when
directly comparing treated and untreated controls, the dif-
ference in effect size was only statistically significant in the
case of nonverbal ability, Q(1) = 6.09, p = .01. On most
measures the pattern of findings across studies were con-
sistent (the true variation between studies was zero or not
significant, see Table 1). Note that N-back training shows a
significant effect on nonverbal ability (g = 0.15, p = .02) in
studies with treated controls. Further examination of the
studies with the largest effect sizes for N-back training
transferring to nonverbal ability revealed several short-
comings, which unfortunately are common in the working
memory training literature (see Redick, 2015). For the five
largest effect sizes, all comparisons had (a) small sample
sizes (less than the minimum 20 observations per group as
recommended by Simmons et al., 2011) and (b) used only
one test to measure nonverbal ability (in contrast to mul-
tiple indicators of the intended nonverbal ability construct;
Shipstead, Redick, & Engle, 2012; von Bastian & Oberauer,
2014). In addition, four of the five comparisons had large,
unexplained pretest-to-posttest decreases for the control
group, which were larger than the training group's pretest-
to-posttest increases. These crossover interactions thus
artificially produced large effect sizes (Boot, Blakely, &
Simons, 2011; Fischer-Baum, 2015; Redick, 2015; Redick &

Webster, 2014), and are responsible for the significant
effect of N-back training and transfer to nonverbal ability.
After only the most problematic study has been removed
from the analysis (Schweizer, Hampshire, & Dalgleish,
2011), the effects of N-back training on nonverbal ability
with treated controls is negligible (g = 0.10). In the mod-
erator analyses, studies with adults showed a small though
significant effect (g = 0.10) as did studies with a small
training dose (g = 0.13); however, both of these significant
effects within the moderator analyses include the prob-
lematic comparisons described above, and when these
studies are excluded the effect sizes reduce to trivial levels.
In any case, these effect sizes are arguably too small to be
relevant to educational practice (Cooper, 2008; also see
Promising Practices network at www.promisingpractices
.net and the What Works Clearinghouse at www.w-w-c
.org). For further details of the moderator analyses of far
transfer, see Table S4­S5 in the Supplemental Material

Follow-up effects from working
memory training on far-transfer
measures
Table 2 shows the effect sizes for each of the far-transfer
measures at follow-up (on average, 5 months after train-
ing). For treated controls there are no statistically signifi-
cant effects on nonverbal ability, verbal ability, word
decoding, or reading comprehension. There is, however, a
significant effect at follow-up for treated controls on arith-
metic. Unfortunately, once again this effect seems to be
driven by three comparisons across two studies (
Alloway,
Bibile, & Lau, 2013; Nussbaumer, Grabner, Schneider, &
Stern, 2013), where the control group shows decreases in
performance between pretest and posttest. When these
studies are excluded the effect size is negligible (g = 0.14).
The findings are consistent between studies; there is no
significant variation between studies on any measure.
Immediate effects of working memory
training on intermediate-transfer
measures
Figure 2 shows a summary of the effects from working
memory training on verbal and visuospatial working
memory measures. These effects are significant and mod-
erate in size, and there is evidence of true heterogeneity
between studies (see Table 1). On verbal working memory
tests (see Table S6 in the Supplemental Material available
online), children and older adults show significantly larger
effects of training than adults, and samples with learning
disorders show larger effects than samples without
learning difficulties. Also, for verbal working memory,
CogMed shows a significantly larger effect than the other
training programs (see Table S6 in the Supplemental Mate-
rial available online). For visuospatial working memory,
none of the moderators for treated controls were reliably
related to variation between studies (see Table S7 in the
Supplemental Material available online), although studies
with treated controls produced smaller effects compared
to untreated controls, Q(1) = 4.52, p = .03.
Follow-up effects of working memory
training on intermediate-transfer
measures
Table 2 shows the effect sizes for each of the intermedi-
ate-transfer outcomes at follow-up (on average, 5 months
after training). At follow-up, the effects for verbal working
memory were no longer significant in studies with treated
controls but still significant for studies with untreated con-
trols. For visuospatial working memory, there were still
significant effects at follow-up (see Table 2). It is impor-
tant to note, however, that for many studies, the visuospa-
tial working memory tests consisted of tasks that were
similar in stimuli or method to those that were trained
(e.g., the CogMed program and the span tests used in
many of the CogMed studies).
Effects of working memory training
on near-transfer measures
There were large effects on tasks that are similar or iden-
tical to those that are trained (see Fig. 2). The findings,

though statistically significant, vary across studies (true
heterogeneity is present, see Table 1) and are maintained
at follow-up (5 months after training; see Table 2). At
posttest, studies with treated controls show significantly
smaller effects than those with untreated controls, Q(1) =
13.70, p = .0001. In treated-control studies, age was a
significant moderator, with smaller effects among chil-
dren than younger and older adults. In addition, near-
transfer effects were larger in subjects that were healthy
and did not have a condition associated with impaired
working memory. There were no other significant mod-
erators (for details, see Table S8 in the Supplemental
Material available online).
The relationship between measures
of near and far transfer
A series of mediation models were used to assess the
extent to which improvements in working memory per-
formance following training accounted for improvements
on far-transfer measures (nonverbal ability and verbal
ability). The first model contains the subset of studies that
reported measures of both nonverbal ability and working
memory measures similar to the tasks that were trained.
Because treated controls showed significantly smaller
training effects on nonverbal ability than untreated con-
trols, we ran a meta-regression model (random effects
model, method of moments) where we controlled for the
type of control group with a dummy variable (coded as
1 for treated and 0 for untreated). The results showed that
type of control was a predictor of gains on tests of non-
verbal ability ( = .27, p = .04). However, improvements
in nonverbal ability were not significantly related to
improvements on the near-transfer working memory
tasks ( = -.01, p = .86, k = 26). Second, we examined
whether improvements on visuospatial working memory
mediated the effects from working memory training on
nonverbal ability. The meta-regression model showed
that type of control (untreated vs. treated controls) was a
significant predictor of gains in nonverbal ability ( = .20,
p < .01) but improvements in the visuospatial working
memory measures did not explain any further variance
( = .13, p = .10, k = 38). Finally, we examined whether
the degree of verbal working memory improvement
mediates the degree of improvement on measures of ver-
bal ability. We ran a meta-regression model where we
first controlled for type of control group in the subset of
studies that reported data on both verbal working mem-
ory and verbal ability. The results showed that type of
control group did not account for any statistically signifi-
cant differences in gains in verbal abilities ( = -.03,
p = .75). Second, we examined whether improvements
on verbal working memory mediated the effects from
working memory training on verbal abilities, and there
was no evidence of an effect ( = .11, p = .19, k = 29).
Overall, these analyses fail to provide support for the
idea that improvements on measures of far transfer are
mediated by improvements in working memory capacity.
The absence of such effects calls into question the theo-
retical rationale for the training studies reviewed here,
because such studies are predicated on the notion of a
mediated relationship (that improvements on far-transfer
measures are causally dependent on the degree of
improvement in working memory capacity, which is seen

as a limiting factor for performance on measures of far
transfer). In contrast, the meta-regression results pro-
vided additional evidence that the type of control group
used (treated vs. untreated) accounts for significant vari-
ance in the nonverbal ability outcomes.
Analyses of publication bias
To address publication bias, we analyzed whether there
were differences between published studies and the grey
literature (see Table S9 in the Supplemental Material
available online). Overall, there was a tendency for stud-
ies in the grey literature to have smaller effect sizes, but
this was only significant for verbal working memory and
visuospatial working memory (note that we did not con-
duct tests for outcomes where there were four or fewer
grey studies).
We did a p-curve analysis of published studies that
have reported significant (p < .05, two-tailed) far-transfer
effects from working memory training. In a p-curve anal-
ysis, if the studies have evidential value, we expect to
find a right-skewed curve with more low p values than
higher p values. If the opposite is the case, and the stud-
ies have no evidential value (likely due to publication
bias or p-hacking), we expect to find a left-skewed
p-curve with more higher than lower p values. Because
of the differences between treated and untreated controls
found in the previous analyses, we did one p-curve for
studies with untreated controls and one for treated con-
trols. For studies with untreated controls we expected to
find evidential value (a right skewed p-curve with more
lower p values), because these studies are likely to show
evidential value because the untreated control compari-
son overestimates the "true" effects of intervention. For
the studies with treated controls, we expected to find no
evidential value in the p-curve because the overall mean
effect size concerning far transfer from studies that use
active controls is close to zero. In spite of this, numerous
published studies have reported significant far-transfer
effects. We therefore expect to find evidence of publica-
tion bias here (exclusion of studies or analyses).
Detailed rules for including studies in the p-curve
analysis are shown in Table S10, in the Supplemental
Material available online. For details of the studies that
the p-curves are based on, as well as excluded studies,
see Table S11 in the Supplemental Material available
online. Unfortunately, there has been an extensive use of
one-tailed significance tests in published studies in this
field (multiple studies with analysis of variance and anal-
ysis of covariance models, which is not possible given
that the F distribution is asymmetric). In the p-curve anal-
ysis these p values were transformed into two-tailed val-
ues. Six of the studies that claimed significant far transfer
when using a one-tailed test exceeded p = .05 when we
used this more conventional two-tailed approach (see
Table S11 in the Supplemental Material available online).
Because a p-curve analysis only includes studies that
report significant findings, these six studies were excluded
from the p-curve analysis.
Figure 3 (panel A) shows the p-curve for published
studies with untreated controls. In line with our hypoth-
esis, the p-curve shows that these studies have evidential
value with a right-skewed p-curve (i.e., significantly more
p values of .01 or below than higher p values, z(16) =
-3.41, p < .01). Figure 3 (panel B) shows the p-curve for
studies of working memory training using treated con-
trols only; this confirms our hypothesis, as there is no
evidential value from the studies of working memory
training using active controls, z(11) = -2.19, p = .01. The
p-curve is flat or slightly left-skewed, providing evidence
of publication bias (exclusion of whole studies or parts of
studies). If a real effect existed, we would expect the
p-curve to be right-skewed.
Discussion
Our meta-analysis of working memory training reveals a
clear pattern. Current working memory training programs
yield short-term improvements on both verbal and visuo-
spatial working memory tasks. For verbal working mem-
ory, these short-term near-transfer effects are not
sustained when they are reassessed after a delay of a few
months. For measures of visuospatial working memory,
modest training effects appear to be maintained at fol-
low-up, but these outcome tasks often share features
(memoranda, method) with the tasks trained. Most seri-
ously, however, there is no evidence that working mem-
ory training convincingly produces effects that generalize
to important real-world cognitive skills (nonverbal ability,
verbal ability, word decoding, reading comprehension,
arithmetic) even when assessments take place immedi-
ately after training, especially when compared against a
treated control group.
There were two cases where there appears to be weak
evidence for transfer from working memory training to
measures of real-world cognitive skills: improvements in
reading comprehension immediately after training (that
were not sustained at follow-up) and improvements in
arithmetic at follow-up (in the absence of effects at imme-
diate posttest). However, we believe that there are strong
reasons to doubt that these effects are genuine. Both
effects appear to be driven by studies in which the control
group show a decrease between pretest to posttest, and
such a pattern inflates estimates of the effect size obtained
(in extreme cases a large decrease in scores in the control
group, coupled with no significant change in scores for
the trained group, would lead to a significant but arguably
artefactual effect of training). This pattern of declines in
524 Melby-Lervåg et al.
the controls on stable constructs such as reading compre-
hension and arithmetic is completely unexpected and
presumably reflects measurement error. Contrary to the
claims made in the original articles, we believe that such
a pattern provides no evidence for a training effect
(Redick, 2015). In addition, neither of these effects was
significant in the untreated control comparisons.
Given our broad inclusion criteria, we were able to
examine a number of possible moderators of working
memory training effects on transfer. In contrast to specu-
lation in the literature that the characteristics of the par-
ticipants (age, learning difficulties) and training procedure
(dose, training type) are critical for producing far transfer
in certain studies, we found virtually no evidence of sig-
nificant moderator effects, especially for nonverbal abil-
ity. We did find significant moderator effects on
intermediate and near transfer (verbal and visuospatial
working memory), suggesting that we had sufficient
power to detect such effects if they were present. We
believe that the lack of significant moderator effects on
nonverbal ability is important since it contradicts many
suggestions in the literature.
Methodological issues in the studies of
working memory training
One major methodological issue comes out strongly from
our review: the problem of using untreated control
groups. In our analyses, we separated studies with treated
controls from those with untreated controls. It is clear
from our analyses that the effects of working memory
training on measures of far transfer are absent (nonverbal
ability, verbal ability, word decoding, arithmetic) in stud-
ies using treated control groups. As noted in the Intro-
duction, only studies using treated control groups provide
a sound basis for claiming support for specific causal
effects of working memory training. Just as new medica-
tions are compared against inert pills in clinical trials to
control for placebo effects, working memory training
interventions should be compared against treated control
groups to provide evidence for specific effects of work-
ing memory training in causing gains in unpracticed abil-
ities. We recommend that investigators stop conducting
working memory training studies with untreated control
groups and that journals stop publishing them. It should
also be noted that the type of active control group used
is also potentially important (see Mohr et al., 2009). For
example, whether an active control group uses a non-
adaptive training regime or a different, adaptive activity
may have effects (Weicker et al., 2016). Because many of
the studies reviewed did not describe the active control
group scheme in much detail, there were too few studies
to do a more fine-grained analysis of this. However, this
is potentially important to consider in future studies.
Another important methodological issue is the use of
mediation analyses to relate changes on far-transfer mea-
sures to changes in working memory capacity. Such anal-
yses allow us to investigate the extent to which changes
on a far-transfer measure can be accounted for by
changes in the theoretically critical mediating variable--
working memory capacity (see Hulme et al., 2012, for an
application of such analyses to explaining effects of inter-
vention procedures in studies of reading development).
In this article, we reported meta-regression models to
assess the extent to which, across studies, improvements
in outcome measures (e.g., verbal ability) were related to
improvements in theoretically relevant mediators (e.g.,
verbal working memory capacity). Those analyses
revealed no evidence for any mediated relationships.
These findings undermine the rationale for working
memory training studies. If working memory training

Working Memory Training on Intelligence Measures 525
produces far transfer because of increased working
memory capacity, there should be a direct relationship
between the degree to which working memory skills
increase and the extent of increases in measures of far
transfer, such as fluid intelligence. We believe it is impor-
tant for future studies of working memory training to be
adequately powered to allow for convincing tests of
mediated relationships.
On a related point, many of the studies included in the
meta-analyses we have reported here contain small sam-
ple sizes, which result in very low power. For instance in
the 120 studies that reported transfer effects to nonverbal
IQ, the mean sample size was 22.4 participants in the
training group and 22.1 in the control group (see Table S3
in the Supplemental Material available online). The larg-
est effect size for working memory training on nonverbal
ability came from the earliest study (d = 2.18; Klingberg
et al., 2002), which included only 7 subjects in each of
the training and control groups. Given the tendency for
small sample sizes to produce inflated effect-size esti-
mates (Button et al., 2013), future studies should include
larger samples to produce more precise effect-size
estimates.
Here is one demonstration of how small sample sizes
produce inflated effect sizes in the current dataset.

Simmons et al. (2011) recommended that at a minimum,
20 subjects/observations need to be present in each cell
(in this case, group). Therefore, we analyzed posttest
nonverbal ability effect sizes for studies that had at least
20 subjects in each of the training and the control group
versus studies that had less than 20 subjects in each of
the training and the control group. For treated controls,
the k = 34 studies meeting the minimum recommended
sample sizes produced no effect, g = 0.01, whereas the
k = 25 comparisons with fewer subjects produced a sig-
nificant effect, g = 0.26. For untreated controls, the k = 31
studies meeting the minimum recommended sample
sizes produced a significant effect, g = 0.16, as did the
k = 18 comparisons with fewer subjects, g = 0.33. These
results provide clear evidence that nonverbal ability
transfer is largest in studies with untreated controls and
small sample sizes, and no effects are observed in studies
with treated controls and at least the minimum recom-
mended number of subjects in the training and control
groups.
The problem with studies of low power is that pub-
lished studies are likely to be biased because only those
with large or very large effect sizes will generate statisti-
cally significant results and therefore get published (the
so-called "file-drawer problem"). This is termed by Bogg
and Lasecki (2015) a "winner's curse" because such very
large effect sizes are unlikely to be true. Kraemer,
Gardner, Brooks, and Yesavage (1998) have argued force-
fully that meta-analyses should exclude studies that are
underpowered, as this will go a long way to removing
the problem of misleading conclusions arising from the
file drawer problem. The p-curve analyses presented ear-
lier provide evidence of publication bias in studies with
treated control groups in this field.
Practical implications
Working memory training has frequently been claimed to
increase intelligence and other important real-world
skills. However, based on an analysis of the 87 studies
containing 145 independent experiments reviewed here,
we observed no evidence of such effects. The general
pattern of a lack of transfer to real-world constructs fits
with other recent meta-analyses that assess the potential
therapeutic benefit of working memory training. For
example, there is no evidence that working memory
training reduces symptoms in individuals with ADHD
(Cortese et al., 2015; Rapport, Orban, Kofler, & Friedman,
2013).
Theoretical implications
Given the strong relationship between working memory
capacity and fluid intelligence (for a review, see Unsworth,
2015), the lack of transfer effects from working memory
training to nonverbal and verbal abilities may appear sur-
prising. The absence of such effects may simply reflect the
fact that there is no causal relationship between working
memory capacity and fluid intelligence (Harrison et al.,
2013). However, working memory capacity and intelli-
gence share approximately 50% common variance (mea-
sured with latent variables; Kane, 
Hambrick, & Conway,
2005). If working memory training did work to produce
increases in intelligence, increases in working memory
after training must be responsible for increasing the pro-
cesses that are shared with intelligence. As we have
shown with our mediation analyses, the available evi-
dence suggests that is not the case--gains on measures
of working memory were not related to the size of gains
on measures of intelligence (nonverbal and verbal abil-
ity). This result may reflect the fact that individual differ-
ences in working memory capacity are multifaceted
(Gibson & Gondoli, 2013). Having participants repeat-
edly practice a working memory task may not necessarily
engage those aspects of working memory that reflect
common processes shared with measures of intelligence.
For example, according to one prominent view of
individual differences in working memory capacity, indi-
viduals vary in (a) the number of items that can be held
in primary memory; (b) the ability to search strategically
among items in secondary memory; and (c) the ability
to control attention according to goals (Unsworth,
Fukuda, Awh, & Vogel, 2014). Unsworth et al. (2014)
526 Melby-Lervåg et al.
demonstrated that all three sources of variance (primary
memory, secondary memory, attention control) were
necessary to fully mediate the relationship between
working memory capacity and fluid intelligence. An
important question, then, is how likely is it that repeat-
edly practicing a task such as N-back leads to changes in
any or all of these three sources of working memory
capacity? Hypothetically, even if repeatedly practicing an
N-back task were to improve an individual's attention
control, it may be that this would not be sufficient to
increase the individual's intelligence score from pretest to
posttest. In addition, it is important to remember that "the
variance of the score gains can have a radically different
composition than the variance of the scores themselves"
(Hayes, Petrov, & Sederberg, 2015, p. 9). Therefore, even
though variation in working memory capacity may
account for up to 50% of the variance in fluid intelligence
at pretest, pretest-to-posttest increases in scores on an
intelligence test do not necessarily reflect working mem-
ory increases, even after a working memory training
intervention (see also Estrada, Ferrer, Abad, Román, &
Colom, 2015, and Haier, 2014, for discussion of intelli-
gence gain scores in the context of training).
As is evident in our figures, even though the meta-
analytic effect sizes tended to be nonsignificant, there
are certainly individual studies that demonstrate trans-
fer effects. If working memory training is not respon-
sible for these changes, then what is? For studies in
which untreated controls are used (and even in studies
with treated controls where the subjects have different
expectancies than the training group about the inter-
vention) motivation could partially explain differences,
given previous research showing effects of motivation
on intelligence tests (Duckworth, Quinn, Lynam,
Loeber, & Stouthmaer-Loeber, 2011). For intermediate-
and near-transfer effects to verbal and visuospatial
working memory tasks, the development of task- or stim-
ulus-specific strategies is likely to explain a large amount
of the pretest-to-posttest improvement (Dunning &
Holmes, 2014; Gibson, Gondoli, Johnson, & Robison,
2014; Sprenger et al., 2013). As noted elsewhere (Logie,
2012), high- and low-ability individuals performing the
same complex task may strategically use their cognitive
resources differently so that repeatedly practicing the
same task over sessions may not address the same cog-
nitive processes to the same degree across all people.
Whether the correct explanation is in terms of changes
in motivation or strategy, it seems quite possible that
improvements on working memory tasks following
training do not reflect genuine increases in working
memory capacity. It is also possible that some positive
effects in this literature reflect the effects of publication
bias (because positive effects are more likely to be
published than null results).
Conclusions
Our meta-analysis included an impressive number of
studies from the burgeoning working memory training
literature, but the pattern of results is consistent with an
earlier review (Melby-Lervåg & Hulme, 2013). Although
there is evidence for near transfer to similar verbal and
visuospatial working memory tasks, all immediate and
delayed comparisons of nonverbal ability, verbal ability,
reading comprehension, word decoding, and arithmetic
were not significantly different from zero when com-
pared against treated controls and eliminating outlier
studies. Using mediation analyses, we showed that the
size of working memory gains was not related to the size
of gains on measures of "far transfer." We conclude that
there is no evidence that working memory training yields
improvements in so-called far-transfer abilities.
It cannot be concluded from the current review that
working memory training could never produce improve-
ments on measures of intelligence or other real-world
cognitive skills. However, the extensive efforts in this
field to date are discouraging. We believe that current
evidence suggests that further attempts to increase work-
ing memory capacity by repetitively practicing simple
memory tasks on a computer are unlikely to lead to gener-
alized cognitive benefits. We believe new training
approaches, likely based on deeper theoretical analyses,
will need to be developed and tested if the field of working
memory training is to move forward. As we have discussed
elsewhere (Redick, Shipstead, Wiemers, Melby-Lervåg, &
Hulme, 2015), given the repeated finding that training
produces near transfer, training specific skills with inter-
ventions that are similar to the targeted outcome will
likely be a more fruitful approach than current working
memory training programs. In this vein, there is good
evidence that difficulties with word reading and prob-
lems with reading and language comprehension can be
improved by intensive, targeted educational interventions
(see Hulme & Melby-Lervåg, 2015). We believe that
attempts to produce lasting improvements in attainment
and intelligence may be better pursuing these more "con-
ventional" approaches (particularly approaches that
involve more varied and stimulating educational inter-
ventions) than using repetitive computerized memory
games. Finally, we have highlighted a number of critical
methodological weaknesses in many studies in this area
and have made some recommendations that we believe
are important for guiding future studies in the field of
cognitive training more generally.
