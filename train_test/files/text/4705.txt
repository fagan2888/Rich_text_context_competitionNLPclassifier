Introduction
Visceral adipose tissue is not only a storage depot of
excess energy, but also an endocrine organ that secretes a
number of factors into circulation, some of which exag-
gerate systemic inflammation, leading to the development
of insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases.1­5
Perivascular adipose tissue (PAT), one of the ectopic adi-
pose tissues, is thought to serve as a structural support for
blood vessels. However, recent studies show that PAT
secretes numerous vasoactive molecules involved in vas-
cular remodeling and vasoreactivity.6­10 Takaoka et al.

Abstract
Background: Perivascular adipose tissue is implicated in vasoreactivity; however, its effect on atherosclerosis remains
undefined.
Methods and results: We examined the effect of a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) on phenotypic alterations of the
thoracic periaortic adipose tissue (tPAT) in apoE-deficient (apoE­/­) mice. Gene expression of the components of the
renin angiotensin system and that of macrophage markers were significantly higher in apoE­/­ mice fed an HCD than in
those fed a chow diet (CD). These changes were absent both in angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blocker (ARB)-treated
apoE­/­ mice and in Ang II type 1 (AT1
) receptor-deficient apoE­/­ (Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­) mice. To evaluate their effect on
atherosclerosis, we transplanted tPAT into apoE­/­ mice alongside the distal abdominal aorta. Transplanted tPAT was
harvested from apoE­/­ and Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ mice fed a CD (tPAT-CD/apoE­/­, tPAT-CD/Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­), HCD (tPAT-
HCD/apoE­/­, tPAT-HCD/Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­), or HCD in combination with ARB treatment (tPAT-HCD/ARB/apoE­/­).
Four weeks after transplantation, a significantly increased oil red O-positive area was observed in the aorta of tPAT-
HCD/apoE­/­ mice than in tPAT-CD/apoE­/­ mice. Such a change was absent in tPAT-HCD/ARB/apoE­/­ and tPAT-HCD/
Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ mice.
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that AT1
receptor plays a crucial role in HCD-induced phenotypic alterations
of tPAT, modulation of which could exert beneficial effects on atherosclerosis.

and concluded that this contributed to exaggerated neoin-
timal formation following arterial injury.11 Chatterjee et
al. also found elevated pro-inflammatory gene expression
and diminished adiponectin expression in the PAT sur-
rounding diseased human coronary arteries.12 These find-
ings suggested that, through its paracrine effects on
vasculature, PAT influenced the development of athero-
sclerosis. However, the precise roles of PAT in atherogen-
esis remained unknown.
Thoracic periaortic adipose tissue (tPAT) surrounding
the descending thoracic aorta has similar characteristics to
those of brown adipose tissue13 and has recently become a
focal point of cardiovascular disease risk assessment. Fox
et al. reported that the volume of tPAT, quantified by com-
puted tomography, correlated with the incidence of periph-
eral arterial disease.14 These authors also found that a high
volume of tPAT in the absence of a high volume of visceral
adipose tissue correlated with a higher prevalence of car-
diovascular disease.15 Considering that phenotypic altera-
tionsoftPAT,suchashigherexpressionsofpro-inflammatory
cytokines accompanied by inflammatory leukocytes infil-
tration, were observed in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD),12
these changes likely had a proatherogenic effect. However,
Chang et al. recently reported that, owing to reduced ther-
mogenic capacity, the absence of tPAT in their gene-manip-
ulated mouse model exaggerated atherosclerosis
development upon cold exposure.16 These findings led us to
hypothesize that, depending on the phenotypic alterations
that occur under specific conditions, tPAT plays contrasting
roles in the development of atherosclerosis.
We have previously reported that tPAT-specific activa-
tion of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) occurred in
uninephrectomized apoE-deficient (apoE­/­) mice, and that
this was partially responsible for the accelerated atheroscle-
rotic development observed in chronic kidney disease.17
Here, we examined high-cholesterol diet (HCD)-induced
phenotypic alterations in tPAT, and investigated their roles
in atherosclerosis development using a tPAT transplanta-
tion model. An HCD promoted the expression of RAS
components as well as that of macrophage markers. Such
changes were not observed in epididymal white adipose tis-
sue (WAT). These tPAT-specific phenotypic alterations
were absent both in angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blocker
(ARB)-treated apoE­/­ mice and in Ang II type 1 (AT1
)
receptor-deficient apoE-/- (Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­) mice. We dem-
onstrate for the first time that, compared to tPAT from chow
diet-(CD) fed apoE­/­ mice, transplantation of tPAT from
HCD-fed apoE­/­ mice significantly exaggerates athero-
sclerosis development in the entire aorta. Further, trans-
plantation of tPAT from ARB-treated apoE­/­ mice or
Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ mice markedly inhibited atherosclerosis
development when compared to tPAT transplantation from
control mice. Our findings suggest that HCD-induced phe-
notypic alteration of tPAT, mediated by AT1
receptor,
directly contributes to atherosclerosis development, and
that therapeutic targeting of the phenotypic changes of
tPAT could potentially remediate and prevent cardiovascu-
lar diseases.
Methods
Animals
ApoE­/­ mice (C57BL/6) were obtained from Taconic Co.,
Ltd. (Germantown, NY, USA). AT1a
receptor-deficient
(Agtr1­/­) mice (C57BL/6) were obtained from Tanabe
Seiyaku Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Agtr1­/­ mice were
crossed with apoE­/­ mice. Heterozygous animals were
crossed until homozygous double knockout (Agtr1­/­/
apoE­/­) mice were obtained (backcrossed > 10 times).
Eight-week-old male apoE­/­ mice were fed a CD or HCD
(36% fat, 1.25% cholesterol; Oriental Yeast Co., Tokyo,
Japan) in combination with ARB (Olmesartan, 1 mg/kg/
day) or saline (using an osmotic minipump) for four or
eight weeks. Eight-week-old male Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ mice
were fed a CD or HCD for four or eight weeks. The animals
were housed in a room that was maintained at 22°C under a
12-hour light/dark cycle and were provided with drinking
water ad libitum. Mice were anaesthetized using isoflurane
(2%, 0.2 ml/min) throughout the surgery during transplan-
tation. The depth of anesthesia was confirmed by lack of
tail pinch response. A laparotomy was performed under
sterile conditions with the assistance of an operating stere-
omicroscope. A periaortic fat pad near the descending tho-
racic aorta (tPAT) was harvested from 16-week-old donor
apoE­/­ mice, fed for eight weeks either with a CD (tPAT-
CD), an HCD (tPAT-HCD), or an HCD in combination with
ARB treatment (tPAT-HCD/ARB), and subsequently trans-
planted over the endogenous infrarenal abdominal periaor-
tic adipose tissue of 20-week-old apoE­/­ mice fed an HCD
for 12 weeks. A periaortic fat pad from 16-week-old donor
Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ mice, fed for eight weeks with a CD or
HCD, was similarly transplanted into 20-week-old apoE­/­
mice. Finally, the musculofascial and skin incisions were
sutured. Sham surgeries of control animals were performed
in the same manner, but without transplantation of tPAT.
Mice were anaesthetized before the implantation of osmotic
minipumps. At 24 weeks of age, the area of the atheroscle-
rotic lesion in the aorta was evaluated. Before harvesting
the tissues (aortas), mice were euthanized by trans-cardiac
perfusion under terminal anesthesia induced by intraperito-
neal administration of pentobarbital (200 mg/kg). All
experiments were performed by strictly adhering to
Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and to
the Guidelines for Animal Experiments of the Kyoto
Prefectural University of Medicine, following approval by
a local university ethics review board.
Hemodynamic analysis
Mean blood pressure and heart rates were measured
under conscious and unrestrained conditions using a
Irie et al. 69
programmable sphygmomanometer (BP-98A; Softron,
Tokyo, Japan).
Plasma lipid analysis.Measurements of total cholesterol,
triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol,
and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol were out-
sourced to SRL, Tokyo, Japan.
Quantitative measurement of atherosclerotic lesions. Mice were
euthanized at the age of 24 weeks, and atherosclerotic lesions
were analyzed. Imaging and analysis of oil-red O-stained
aortas were accomplished using Scion Imaging Software.
The aortic lesion area in each animal was expressed as the
percentage of lesion area per total aortic area.
Immunohistochemistry.tPAT was quickly removed after
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) perfusion, embedded in
paraffin, and immunofluorescently labeled using a combi-
nation of anti-mouse Mac2 antibody (CEDARLANE, Burl-
ington, Ontario, Canada) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Nuclei were labeled using diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) solution (DOJINDO, Kumamoto, Japan), and the
sections were examined using an LSM 510 METAconfocal
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For a negative
control, non-immune immunoglobulin and Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated secondary antibodies were used. The num-
ber of Mac2-positive cells was assessed using data col-
lected from five sections and six animals in each group.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from adipose tissue and reverse
transcribed to prepare cDNA. Real-time PCR was per-
formed on a Thermal Cycler Dice (Takara Bio, Shiga,
Japan), using SYBR Premix Ex Taq 2 (Takara Bio, Shiga,
Japan). Dissociation curves were examined for the aber-
rant formation of primer dimers. PCR-amplified products
were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels to confirm the
presence of a single amplicom. Data were expressed as
gene expression levels relative to that of control.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay
Blood from the right ventricular was collected in tubes con-
taining citrate at a final concentration of 0.01 M. Serum was
separated by centrifugation at 1000 g for 20 minutes, and
stored -80°C. Adipose tissue was homogenized in 600 µl
buffer containing PBS and 0.04% Tween 80 using a rotary
homogenizer. Homogenized tissue samples were centrifuged
at 10,000 g for 10 minutes and the supernatants were col-
lected. The amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-),
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and adiponectin present in the serum
were estimated using commercial ELISA kits (MTA00B,
M6000B and MRP300, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).
The levels of TNF-, IL-6 and adiponectin in the adipose
tissue were estimated using ELISA kits (cat.88-7324 and
cat.88-7064, eBioscience, San Diego, CA, and MRP300,
R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The assays were carried
out according to the manufacturers'instructions.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as the mean ± SE. Mean values
were compared using ANOVA. If a statistically significant
effect was found, Scheffe's F test was performed to ana-
lyze the differences between the groups. p < 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
Periaortic adipose tissue-specific activation of
the RAS in HCD-fed apoE­/­ mice
To examine the effect of an HCD on phenotypic alterations
of adipose tissue, 8-week-old apoE­/­ mice were fed either
a CD or HCD until they reached 12 weeks of age. The
body weight and body weight ratios of tPAT and epididy-
mal WAT pads were not affected by HCD feeding (Figure
1(a)). The histomorphological analysis of both adipose
pads revealed no discernible differences between the two
groups of mice (Figure 1(b)). We compared the expression
of adipocyte differentiation-related genes, RAS compo-
nents, monocyte/macrophage markers, and adipocy-
tokines. An HCD significantly upregulated the expression
of adipocyte differentiation-related genes, including those
of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR)
and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) both in tPAT and
WAT (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). The expression levels of
RAS components, including angiotensinogen (AGT),
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and AT1a
receptor
(AT1a
R), were significantly higher in the tPAT of HCD-fed
mice, while AGT expression level was significantly lower
in the WAT of HCD-fed mice (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)).
Furthermore, the levels of monocyte/macrophage markers,
including CD68 and CD206, were significantly higher in
the tPAT of HCD-fed apoE­/­ mice, whereas no such differ-
ences were observed in the WAT (Figures 2(e) and 2(f)). In
both tPAT and WAT, the expression levels of the inflamma-
tory adipokines, TNF-, IL-6, and monocyte chemoat-
tractant protein 1 (MCP-1), were not altered by the HCD
(Figures 2(g) and 2(h)). These findings suggested that
HCD feeding led to the activation of adipose tissue RAS in
a tissue-specific manner, and that this was accompanied by
increased accumulation of monocytes/macrophages.
HCD-induced phenotypic alterations are
significantly suppressed by angiotensin II
receptor blockade or AT1
receptor deficiency
We next examined the involvement of the AT1
receptor
in tPAT-specific HCD-induced phenotypic alterations.
70 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(1)
Neither ARB treatment nor AT1
deficiency (data not
shown) affected pad weight. Four weeks of ARB treat-
ment along with HCD significantly suppressed the
mRNA expression of AGT, ACE and PPAR (Figures
3(a) and 3(c)). Additionally, treatment with ARB blocker
led to a significant reduction in the gene expression lev-
els of the monocyte/macrophage markers, including
F4/80 (Figure 3(e)). Notably, the gene expression of the
proinflammatory adipokines, TNF-, IL-6, and MCP-1,
markedly diminished after ARB treatment (Figure 3(g)).
The HCD-induced phenotypic alterations observed in
apoE­/­ mice were absent in Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ mice
(Figures 3(b), 3(d), 3(f) and 3(h)). These findings sug-
gested that the AT1
receptor plays a critical role in tPAT-
specific HCD-induced phenotypic alterations, and that
AT1
blockade could be used as a potential strategy to
suppress inflammatory responses in the tPAT.
Intra-abdominal transplantation of the tPAT from
ARB-treated apoE­/­ mice prevents atherosclerotic
development throughout the aorta
Intra-abdominal tPAT transplantation was performed to
examine whether tPAT-specific phenotypic alterations con-
tributed toward the development of atherosclerosis. The
tPAT was harvested from 16-week-old apoE­/­ mice fed a
CD (tPAT-CD), an HCD (tPAT-HCD), or an HCD in combi-
nation with ARB administration (tPAT-HCD/ARB), and
transplanted alongside the distal abdominal aorta of
20-week-old apoE­/­ mice fed an HCD starting from 8
weeks of age. The weights of transplanted tPAT were 11.3 ±
0.7, 8.8 ± 0.5, and 6.0 ± 0.3 mg, respectively. The weights of
tPAT from HCD-fed and ARB-treated HCD-fed apoE­/­
mice were significantly lower than CD-fed apoE­/­ mice (p
< 0.05). Four weeks after transplantation, compared with
tPAT-CD transplanted mice, the atherosclerotic lesion area
of the entire aorta in tPAT-HCD transplanted mice showed a
modest, yet significant, increase (29%, p < 0.01) (Figures
4(a) and 4(b)). The body weight and body weight ratios of
epididymal WAT pads were also equivalent among the
groups after fat transplantation (Supplemental Figures 1(a)
and 1(b)). The hemodynamic parameters and lipid profiles
did not differ between these two groups (Supplemental
Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). In contrast, the areas of atheroscle-
rotic lesions in tPAT-HCD/ARB transplanted mice were
reduced by 34%, 24% and 42% compared with those of
sham-operated control, tPAT-CD transplanted, and tPAT-
HCD-transplanted mice, respectively (p < 0.01). These
results suggested that transplantation of tPAT-HCD/ARB not
only ameliorated the augmented atherosclerotic develop-
ment as observed in tPAT-HCD transplanted mice, but also
counteracted it when compared to no transplantation in the

sham control. To further elucidate the mechanisms of tPAT
transplantation-associated atherosclerosis development, we
evaluated the atherosclerotic lesion area of the suprarenal
and infrarenal aorta separately. The atherosclerotic lesion
area of the infrarenal aorta differed only between tPAT-
HCD- and tPAT-HCD/ARB-transplanted mice, suggesting
that the anti-atherogenic actions of tPAT-HCD/ARB-
transplanted mice are likely due to its paracrine effects on
the vasculature of the abdominal aorta (Figure 4(c)). The
atherosclerotic development of the suprarenal aorta fol-
lowed similar trends as that in the entire aorta (Figure 4(d)),
supporting the notion that transplanted tPAT exerted both
systemic and local paracrine effects on atherogenesis.

20-week-old recipient apoE­/­ mice fed an HCD from 8
weeks of age. The weights of transplanted tPAT from
HCD-fed Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ mice were significantly lower
than CD-fed Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ mice (7.6 ± 0.6 vs. 14.0 ± 1.6

transplanted mice compared with tPAT-CD/Agtr1­/­/apoE­

transplantation from apoE­/­ mice. The body weight and
body weight ratios of epididymal WAT pads were also
equivalent among the groups after fat transplantation
(Supplemental Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). Hemodynamic
parameters and lipid profiles did not differ between the
two groups (data not shown). A significant reduction in the
atherosclerotic lesion area was observed both in the supra-
renal and infrarenal aortas (Figures 5(c) and 5(d)), sug-
gesting that the inhibitory effect of AT1
receptor deficiency
on atherogenesis occurred at the systemic level.

Effect of tPAT transplantation on the circulating
levels of adipocytokines
To elucidate the mechanisms by which transplanted tPAT
influenced the development of atherosclerosis, we meas-
ured the serum concentrations of adipocytokines related
to atherogenesis. The concentrations of TNF-, IL-6, and
adiponectin in the serum were comparable between tPAT-
CD- and tPAT-HCD-transplanted animals. However,
TNF- and IL-6 levels were significantly lower in tPAT-
HCD/ARB-transplanted mice compared to tPAT-CD- or
tPAT-HCD-transplanted animals (Figures 6(a) and 6(b)).
Conversely, the serum concentration of adiponectin in
tPAT-HCD/ARB-transplanted animals was significantly

higher than that in other groups (Figure 6(c)). These find-
ings suggested that marked reduction in serum proinflam-
matory adipokine levels and an associated increase in
adiponectin concentration are likely responsible for the
anti-atherogenic effects observed in tPAT-HCD/ARB-
transplanted mice.
Transplanted tPAT from ARB-treated apoE­/­
mice exerts anti-inflammatory effects in
recipient mice
To identify the primary tissue source of proinflammatory
cytokines and adiponectin, we examined the transplanted
tPAT grafts in recipient mice. tPAT grafts harvested from
tPAT-CD and tPAT-HCD transplanted mice showed uni-
locular fat droplets similar to those of a WAT, whereas a
transplanted tPAT graft from tPAT-HCD/ARB showed
multilocular fat droplets characteristic of brown adipose
tissue (Figure 7(a)). Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed that the number of Mac-2-positive cells was sig-
nificantly lower in tPAT-HCD/ARB than in tPAT-HCD
(Figures 7(b) and 7(c)). Consistent with the circulating
levels of proinflammatory cytokines, the mRNA expres-
sion levels of TNF- and IL-6 were lower in tPAT-HCD/
ARB, whereas adiponectin mRNA expression was similar
in all three groups (Figure 7(d)). The protein levels of
TNF-, IL-6, and adiponectin were significantly lower in
tPAT-HCD/ARB (Figure 7(e)). In contrast to the tPAT, the
morphological characteristics and mRNA expression lev-
els of adipocytokines in the WAT of all three groups were
comparable (Supplemental Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). The
protein levels of adipocytokines did not differ between
tPAT-HCD and tPAT-HCD/ARB (Supplemental Figure
3(c)). These findings suggested that reduced expression of
TNF- and IL-6 in transplanted tPAT, accompanied by a
relatively limited accumulation of macrophages, likely led
to lower circulating levels of these pro-inflammatory
cytokines and contributed to the prevention of atheroscle-
rotic development in tPAT-HCD/ARB-transplanted mice.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that an HCD induced tPAT-
specific enhanced expression of RAS components and

accumulation of monocytes/macrophages, and that such
changes were absent in ARB-treated apoE­/­ mice as well
as Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ mice. Further, intra-abdominal trans-
plantation of the tPAT from HCD-fed apoE­/­ mice signifi-
cantlyexaggeratedatheroscleroticdevelopmentthroughout
the aorta; atherosclerotic development was markedly sup-
pressed in mice transplanted with the tPAT from ARB-
treated HCD-fed apoE­/­ mice. We also determined that
transplantation of the tPAT from HCD-fed Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­
mice suppressed atherosclerotic development to a greater
extent than transplantation from CD-fed Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­
mice. The tPAT grafts from ARB-treated apoE­/­ mice
expressed lower amounts of proinflammatory cytokines
and had fewer monocytes/macrophages. This was associ-
ated with significantly lower circulating levels of TNF-
and IL-6, and higher adiponectin levels. Our findings
clearly suggest that AT1
receptor-mediated proinflamma-
tory phenotypic alterations of the tPAT are involved in the
development of atherosclerosis, and that modulation of
tPAT phenotype may be a useful therapeutic strategy to
prevent cardiovascular diseases.
It has been reported that the tPAT exhibits a brown adi-
pose tissue-like appearance and the expression profile of
adipocyte-related genes.13,18 Recently, Chang et al. devel-
oped a smooth muscle cell-specific PPAR-deficient
mouse model, in which absence of tPAT markedly reduced
the thermogenic capacity and energy expenditure of exces-
sive nutrition.16 The authors demonstrated that atheroscle-
rosis development was significantly exaggerated when the
animals were housed at 16°C, but not at 22°C, because of
the intravascular temperature-associated endothelial dys-
function and impaired lipid clearance. They also showed
that mRNA expression levels of uncoupling protein 1
(UCP-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-
coactivator (PGC-1) were significantly higher in tPAT
from control mice housed at 16°C than at 22°C, suggesting
that cold-mediated activation of the tPAT exerted anti-ath-
erogenic effects. Therefore, we examined the relationship
between tPAT activation and atherogenesis. UCP-1 mRNA
expression was significantly higher in tPAT-HCD than in
tPAT-CD, whereas such an increase was absent in tPAT-
HCD/ARB (Supplemental Figure 4(a)). Similarly, PGC-
1 mRNA expression was markedly lower in tPAT-HCD/
ARB than in the other groups (Supplemental Figure 4(b)).
Considering that mice were housed at 22°C throughout the
study, tPAT activation was unlikely to be involved in the
tPAT-associated development of atherosclerosis.
It has been established that the AT1
receptor exerts
proatherogenic actions, and that pharmacological block-
ade or a deficiency of the AT1
receptor ameliorates athero-
sclerotic development.19­21 Adipose tissue is a mixture of
various cell types,22 and adipocytes as well as monocytes/
macrophages abundantly express RAS components.23
Putnam et al. have recently generated adipocyte-specific
AT1a
receptor-deficient mice that developed striking
adipocyte hypertrophy when fed a low-fat diet.24 The
authors showed that incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with
Ang II increased oil red O staining and mRNA expression
of PPAR, suggesting that AT1
receptors regulated adipo-
cyte differentiation and morphology. Consistent with their
results, we observed that an HCD promoted the expression
of PPAR as well as RAS components, and treatment with
ARB suppressed PPAR mRNA expression (Figures 2(a),
2(c), and 3(a)). However, suppression of adipocyte differ-
entiation by AT1
blockade may increase lipid storage and
hypertrophy of remaining adipocytes, and promote the
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines,
leading to increased accumulation of inflammatory leuko-
cytes in adipose tissue.25,26 Therefore, future studies using
adipocyte-specific AT1
receptor-deficient atherosclerosis-
prone mice are needed to elucidate the role of adipocyte
AT1
in atherogenesis. In contrast, HCD feeding led to
increased monocytes/macrophages accumulation in the
tPAT, which was blocked by ARB treatment (Figures 2(e)
and 3(e), Supplemental Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). We have
previously reported that bone marrow AT1
receptors play a
crucial role in monocyte differentiation and/or prolifera-
tion.27 Considering that monocytes/macrophages abun-
dantly express all components of RAS23 and may serve as
a predominant source of pro-inflammatory cytokines/
chemokines in adipose tissue,25,26 AT1
receptors expressed
in these cells likely play an important role in HDC-induced
phenotypic alterations in the tPAT and atherosclerotic
development.
Visceral adipose tissue has been reported to release sev-
eral pro-inflammatory cytokines into circulation, causing
systemic inflammation and contributing to the develop-
ment of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance.1­5
Clinical studies have shown that a circulating concentra-
tion of pro-inflammatory cytokines is well correlated with
the incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular dis-
eases.28,29 Studies using animal models also demonstrate
the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines on atherosclerotic
development.30­32 We examined whether tPAT-derived adi-
pocytokines modulated the development of atherosclerosis
in recipient mice. Unexpectedly, there was no difference in
the circulating levels of TNF-, IL-6, and adiponectin
between tPAT-CD- and tPAT-HCD-transplanted mice. The
precise mechanism responsible for the exaggerated athero-
sclerosis observed in tPAT-HCD-transplanted mice is not
clear. However, tPAT from ARB-treated mice exerted an
inhibitory effect on atherosclerotic development. tPAT-
HCD/ARB transplanted mice exhibited higher concentra-
tions of circulating adiponectin and HDL cholesterol
(Figure 6(c) and Supplemental Figure 2(b)). Pro-
inflammatory cytokines have been reported to inhibit adi-
ponectin secretion.33,34 Our results suggested that
transplantation tPAT from tPAT-HCD/ARB exerted a ben-
eficial effect on lipid homeostasis by suppressing systemic
inflammation.
Irie et al. 77
We examined the circulating cytokine levels in the
recipient mice transplanted with AT1
-deficient tPAT; how-
ever, serum concentrations of TNF- and IL-6 did not dif-
fer between tPAT-CD/Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ and tPAT-HCD/
Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ mice (Supplemental Figures 6(a) and
6(d)). Cytokine levels in transplanted tPAT graft also
showed no difference between the two groups
(Supplemental Figures 6(b) and 6(e)). Considering the dis-
crepancy between the data from tPAT-HCD/ARB apoE­/­
mice and tPAT-HCD/Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ mice, we cannot
completely exclude the possibility that residual ARB
within the transplanted tPAT could act as a source of ARBs
in the recipient animal. Conversely, proinflammatory
cytokine levels in epididymal WAT was markedly
decreased in tPAT-HCD/Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ mice compared
with tPAT-CD/Agtr1­/­/apoE­/­ mice (Supplemental
Figures 6(c) and 6(f)), suggesting that tPAT graft from
tPAT-HCD/Agtr1­/­/apoE-- mice could exert an anti-
inflammatory effect on endogenous adipose tissue.
Potential mediators and underlying mechanisms responsi-
ble for these effects need to be investigated in a future
study.
In this study, HCD-induced tPAT phenotypic alteration
was examined in apoE­/­ mice; however, HFD-induced
tPAT modulation in wild-type mice was a quite important
issue, especially in the setting of obesity. We also exam-
ined HFD (but not HCD)-induced phenotypic alteration of
tPAT in wild-type mice and found that macrophage accu-
mulation and gene expression of the RAS components
were exaggerated in tPAT of obese wild-type mice com-
pared with lean control mice (data not shown). Their rele-
vance to atherosclerosis development needs to be examined
in a future study using a tPAT transplant model.
In conclusion, our results showed that periaortic adi-
pose tissue-specific activation of RAS is involved in the
atherosclerotic development in HCD-fed apoE­/­ mice,
and that inhibition of this depot-specific activation of RAS
exerts an anti-atherogenic effect by suppressing systemic
inflammation. Our findings shed new light into the role of
tPAT in atherogenesis, and suggest that perivascular adi-
pose tissue may be a useful new therapeutic target for the
prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
