The Association Between Allergy Skin Testing,
Atopic Respiratory Conditions, and Stroke Mortality
in Middle-Aged and Elderly Adults
Eric M. Matheson, MD, Arch G. Mainous III, PhD, and Mark A. Carnemolla, BS
Background: A history of atopic respiratory conditions has been linked to an increased risk of stroke.
What remains unclear is whether positive allergy skin testing is associated with an increased risk of
stroke. The primary goal of this study was to determine whether positive allergy skin testing is associ-
ated with an increased risk of fatal stroke. A secondary goal is to determine whether having both posi-
tive allergy skin testing and an atopic respiratory condition is associated with a particularly high risk of
stroke death.
Methods: An analysis was performed of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II Mor-
tality Cohort.
Results: Controlling for age, gender, race, alcohol use, smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, and
body mass index, patients with positive allergy skin testing had a hazard ratio for stroke mortality of
1.56 (95% CI, 1.01­2.40) versus those without positive allergy testing. Patients with both positive al-
lergy testing and an atopic respiratory condition had a hazard ratio for stroke mortality of 2.31 (95%
CI, 1.13­4.73).
Conclusions: Individuals with both positive allergy skin testing and an atopic respiratory condition
have more than a 2-fold increased risk of fatal stroke. This novel risk factor has substantial implica-
tions for a large segment of the population not previously considered at risk. (J Am Board Fam Med
2009;22:604­609.)
Stroke is the third leading cause of mortality in the
United States, accounting for more than 150,000
deaths in 2004.1,2 This number is expected to rise
significantly as the population of the United States
ages. Progress has been made in identifying the risk
factors that are responsible for stroke, but our un-
derstanding remains incomplete. Even the most
complex multivariate models including major risk
factors such as smoking and diabetes as well as
more minor risk factors fail to fully predict who is
at risk for stroke.3
In an effort to expand the understanding of
stroke risk factors, researchers have investigated the
link between stroke and a number of chronic dis-
eases. One promising area of investigation has been
research examining the relationship between atopic
respiratory conditions and stroke. Asthma, a disease
strongly tied to atopy, was associated with a 50%
increase in combined fatal and nonfatal stroke risk.4
Building on the notion that atopy may be a risk
factor for stroke, we found that a history of physi-
cian-diagnosed hay fever was associated with more
than a 70% increase in combined fatal and nonfatal
stroke risk.5 Because hay fever may have some mis-
classification as an indicator of atopic sensitivity, it
is unclear whether the relationship between atopic
respiratory conditions and stroke exists with a more
systematic measure of atopy such as allergy skin
testing. To clarify this issue, we examined the risk
of stroke mortality in patients with positive allergy
skin testing in a nationally representative cohort.
We then subdivided the group of patients with
positive allergy skin testing into those with a his-

and/or asthma) and those without atopic respira-
tory conditions.
Methods
Dataset
We analyzed data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey II (NHANES II)
and linked it to the NHANES II Mortality Cohort.
The NHANES II is a nationally representative
survey based on a complex sampling design that
allows for weighted population estimates of the
noninstitutionalized United States population. The
NHANES II was conducted in the United States
between February 1976 and February 1980. The
sample was composed of approximately 27,801
noninstitutionalized United States civilians, with an
age range of 6 months to 74 years, recruited at 64
sampling sites. The survey included a physical ex-
amination, numerous laboratory studies, allergy
skin testing, and an extensive questionnaire about
lifestyle, diet, and medical history. A thorough de-
scription of the NHANES II survey and sampling
procedure has been described previously.6
The NHANES II Mortality Study was a pro-
spective cohort study comprising 9252 adults be-
tween the ages of 30 and 75 and done at the time of
the original NHANES II study.7 Deaths were cap-
tured by linking information from the National
Death Index to matching personal identifiers in the
NHANES II. Based on previous studies, more than
90% of all deaths can be identified by using this
method.8,9 In our study, we followed patients 45
years of age and older from 1976 through Decem-
ber 31, 1992 (Table 1). We did not include patients
younger than 45 years of age because the patho-
physiology of strokes in that population differs sig-
nificantly from those older than age 45. In individ-
uals 45 years of age, 42.7% of all strokes are
either subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhages,
whereas in individuals 45 years of age these com-
prise only 15.7% of strokes.10
Atopic Respiratory Conditions
Individuals were considered to have an atopic re-
spiratory condition if a physician had ever diag-
nosed them with asthma, hay fever, or both asthma
and hay fever.
Allergy Testing
For the purposes of our analysis, all patients who
reported a history of positive allergy skin testing
were included in the group with positive allergy
skin testing. Those who did not report a history of
positive allergy skin testing underwent allergy skin
testing and were included in the positive allergy
skin testing group if they had a positive allergy
response to one or more of the tested allergens.
Allergy testing was performed using a traditional
"skin prick test" administered in a sterile fashion
with a 25 gauge, 3/8-inch needle. The allergens

muda grass, cat, dog, house dust, mixed long and
short ragweed, oak, and perennial rye grass. Hista-
mine served as the control. After administration of
the allergens, readings for wheal and flare reactions
were made at 10 minutes and again at 20 minutes.11
For the purposes of our analysis, we considered a
test positive if a wheal and flare reaction occurred
or if a flare reaction of greater than 5 mm devel-
oped with any of the allergens tested.
Stroke Mortality
Stroke mortality was determined using death cer-
tificates through the National Death Index. We
used the International Classification of Disease
Ninth Revision codes 430 to 438 for stroke mor-
tality.
Control Variables
Several control variables have been identified as risk
factors for stroke mortality and thus may be potential
cofounders of any relationship between positive al-
lergy skin testing and stroke mortality.12­17 Control
variables in our study included age, sex, race, body
mass index (body weight in kg/height in m2), hyper-
lipidemia (defined as low-density lipoproteins 160
mg/dL), diabetes, hypertension, and smoking. Age
and body mass index were treated as continuous vari-
ables. Sex, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension,
and smoking were treated as categorical variables.
Hyperlipidemia was defined as a low-density lipopro-
tein level 160 mg/dL, and patients were categorized
as either being hyperlipidemic or nonhyperlipidemic.
Diabetes was determined by self-report and patients
were categorized as either diabetic or nondiabetic.
Hypertension and smoking were also categorized by
self-report and patients were categorized as either
hypertensive or normotensive and as either a current
smoker or current nonsmoker, respectively.
Analysis
Because of the complex sampling design of the
NHANES II, we used the statistical packages
SUDAAN (SUDAAN Statistical Software Center,
Research Triangle Park, NC) and SAS (SAS Inc.,
Cary, NC) to perform all analyses. We excluded
participants with a history of stroke or coronary
vascular disease because of their extremely high risk
of death from recurrent stroke.17 We used 2 anal-
ysis to examine the bivariate relationships between
participants with positive allergy skin testing and
those with negative allergy skin testing for each of
the categorical control variables. T tests were com-
puted to examine the relationship between partici-
pants with positive allergy skin testing and those
with negative allergy skin testing for each of the
continuous control variables. We used a Cox pro-
portional hazards regression to model time to
stroke mortality, adjusting for age only. We used
age as a covariate (1) because the prevalence of
positive allergy skin testing decreases with age and
(2) because stroke prevalence increases with
age.18,19 For example, in our current dataset, if we
compare patients aged 45 to 54 to those aged 65 to
74, the incidence of stroke increases by more than
850%, whereas the incidence of positive allergy
skin testing decreases by 25%. Because of this re-
lationship, if we fail to adjust for age we confound
any relationship that may exist between positive
allergy skin testing and stroke. After completing
the preliminary regression we performed a fully
adjusted regression with age, sex, race, body mass
index, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and hyper-
lipidemia as covariates. Because we were using a
Cox proportional hazards analysis, we conducted a
Schoenfeld's test to determine whether the hazards
were proportional.20 After performing our primary
analysis examining the relationship between posi-
tive allergy skin testing and risk of fatal stroke, we
performed 2 further survival analyses using the
same cohort. In the first analysis we performed a
Cox proportional hazards analysis comparing the
risk of fatal stroke for individuals with a reported
history of respiratory atopy versus those without a
history of respiratory atopy. We did not include
allergy skin testing in this analysis. In the second
analysis we performed a Cox proportional hazards
analysis comparing the risk of fatal stroke for indi-
viduals with both a history of respiratory atopy and
positive allergy skin testing versus the remainder of
the cohort.
Results
Our cohort consisted of a unweighted sample of
5119 eligible participants (weighted, 45.8 million)
at baseline with a mean follow-up of 11.2 years and
an average age of 57.4 years. There were 119 stroke
deaths (weighted, 732,363 stroke deaths) during
follow-up, with 30 stroke deaths (weighted,
202,081 stroke deaths) in the group with positive
allergy skin testing and 89 stroke deaths (weighted,
606 JABFM November­December 2009 Vol. 22 No. 6 http://www.jabfm.org
530,282 stroke deaths) in the group without posi-
tive allergy skin testing. Participants with positive
allergy skin testing comprised 23.0% of the cohort.
In bivariate relationships, age and alcohol use were
significantly different between the group with pos-
itive allergy skin testing and the group with nega-
tive allergy skin testing. Individuals with positive
allergy skin testing were approximately 1 year
younger than those with negative allergy skin test-
ing and a higher percentage consumed alcohol
(66.1% in the group with positive allergy skin test-
ing versus 59.0% in the group with negative allergy
skin testing).
In a survival analysis adjusting for age, patients
with positive allergy skin testing had a hazard ratio
(HR) for stroke mortality of 1.45 (95% CI, 0.93­
2.25) versus those with negative allergy skin testing.
A statistically significant relationship between pos-
itive allergy testing and risk of stroke mortality was
found in a fully adjusted model (HR, 1.56; 95% CI,
1.01­2.40), controlling for relevant confounding
variables (Table 2). In a survival analysis adjusting
for age, patients with a self-reported history of
respiratory atopy had an HR for stroke mortality of
1.45 (95% CI, 0.76­2.80) versus those without a
history of respiratory atopy. In a fully adjusted
model, patients with a self-reported history of re-
spiratory atopy had an HR for stroke mortality of
1.52 (95% CI, 0.80- 2.92), controlling for relevant
confounding variables (Table 2). In a survival anal-
ysis of individuals with both positive allergy skin
testing and a history of respiratory atopy, we found
an HR for stroke mortality of 2.11 (95% CI, 1.02­
4.37) versus the remainder of the cohort, control-
ling for age. In a fully adjusted model, patients with
both positive allergy skin testing and a history of
respiratory atopy had an HR for stroke mortality of
2.31 (95% CI, 1.13­4.73), controlling for relevant
confounding variables (Table 2).
Schoenfeld testing indicated that the hazards
were proportional in all of the survival analyses that
were performed.
Discussion
The results of this study support previous works
suggesting a relationship between atopic respira-
tory conditions and increased stroke risk. The cur-
rent findings indicate that individuals with a history
of both respiratory atopy and positive allergy skin
testing could have more than a 2-fold increased risk
of fatal stroke. It is significant that individuals who
have both respiratory atopy and positive allergy
skin testing are at much higher risk than those with
either a history of respiratory atopy or positive
allergy skin testing alone. Given that 23% of our
cohort had positive allergy skin testing to one or
more common allergens, this study's findings may
have broad public health implications regarding
who may be at increased risk of stroke death.
Why might atopic respiratory conditions be a
risk factor for future stroke? One potential expla-
nation is that atopic respiratory conditions could
exacerbate sleep apnea by increasing airway resis-
tance through swelling of the respiratory mucosa.21
This may be important because sleep apnea is a
noteworthy risk factor for stroke.22
Another possibility is that atopic respiratory
conditions may increase the risk of stroke by in-

creasing blood pressure.23,24 Although our analysis
suggests that the association between atopic respi-
ratory conditions and stroke remains even after
controlling for a self-reported history of hyperten-
sion, blood pressure may still be important because,
we suspect, atopic respiratory conditions raise
blood pressure only intermittently during acute al-
lergy attacks, which could easily be missed with
typical blood pressure screenings. We also suspect
that atopic respiratory conditions contribute to the
so-called "upper airway resistance syndrome,"
which can cause increased blood pressure during
sleep in otherwise normotensive individuals.25 We
believe it is important to emphasize that patients
can have upper airway resistance syndrome without
meeting the formal definition of sleep apnea.26
During the past 2 decades, increasing evidence
has linked variations in the expression of inflamma-
tory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10,
and 5-lipoxygenase, to stroke.27­32 Atopic respira-
tory conditions have also been linked to similar
changes in IL-6, IL-10, and 5-lipoxygenase.33­36
Given these relationships, inflammation may be a
critical link between atopic respiratory conditions
and stroke.
This study has a few limitations of note. Stroke
death was determined using death certificates
rather than through direct imaging; however, be-
cause the attending physician is responsible for
death certificate completion, he or she would pre-
sumably know how the patient died. In addition,
participants who reported a history of positive al-
lergy skin testing did not undergo allergy skin test-
ing but were included in the allergy group. Because
repeating previously positive skin allergy testing
was not performed in the NHANES II, we in-
cluded in the positive allergy skin testing group
those individuals who stated that they had a previ-
ous positive skin test despite the lack of indepen-
dent confirmatory testing. It is possible that this
could overestimate the true number of individuals
with positive allergy skin testing, but because mis-
representation of a previous positive skin test is not
likely to be related to future stroke, we do not feel
that this would have influenced our results. In ad-
dition, we hoped to investigate the relationship
between allergies and stroke type (ischemic versus
hemorrhagic), but we lacked sufficient power to
perform this analysis. Finally, we were unable to
determine how the use of antihistamines to treat
respiratory atopy may be related to the risk of
stroke because the NHANES II did not clearly
delineate antihistamines from other allergy medi-
cations such as decongestants.
Conclusions
Having both a history of respiratory atopy and
positive allergy skin testing seems to be a risk factor
for stroke mortality. This relatively novel risk fac-
tor has substantial implications for a large segment
of the population not previously considered to be at
risk. We believe additional research is merited to
further explore these findings and determine
whether allergy medications such as antihistamines
modify stroke risk in those with an atopic respira-
tory condition.
