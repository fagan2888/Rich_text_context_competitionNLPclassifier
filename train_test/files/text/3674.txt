Introduction
Interest in the problem of classifying and coding occupations
can be traced back at least as far as the 1850 population cen-
sus, and in subsequent decades it became a major focus of
attention by census officials on both sides of the Atlantic
(Conk, 1978; Woollard, 1999). Reasons for this are not hard
to find. Whether it was tracking the overall progress of indus-
trial society, urban industrial specialization, the social mobil-
ity of immigrants or finding surrogate measures of wealth
and social class, occupational information was one of the
most valuable tools available to census statisticians and offi-
cials in other government agencies (Edwards, 1933).
However, the quest for a satisfactory system of classification
for the U.S. census was still in progress at the start of the
20th century (Hunt, 1909).
Much more recently, the growing availability in digital
form of large historical population data sets containing indi-
vidual-level data, anonymized or otherwise, has re-kindled
interest within several academic disciplines in the seemingly
rather dry topic of occupational classification. However, this
same availability of large data collections, which are now
open to systematic evaluation using powerful database tech-
nologies, in ways that were infeasible until relatively recent
times, has begun to raise a number of questions. These relate
not only to the 19th century census enumeration practices
and published statistics based on the resulting 19th century
census figures but also to the validity, reliability, and "fit-
ness-for-purpose" of electronic coding, both of occupational
data transcribed from manuscript census schedules and of
other measures derived partly or wholly from these data. It is
important that such questions are examined sooner rather
than later, as funding bodies are increasingly relying on the
availability of large secondary data sets, as part of a drive for
efficient use of public monies for research. Yet, in most
cases, much less effort has been expended to date in deter-
mining the quality of these data sets and their suitability for
different types of analyses, than would ideally be the case,
given they are intended to form an accepted part of general
research infrastructure internationally.
It is important to stress at the outset that this is not primar-
ily a criticism of the leading U.S. and European data archives
and centers, such as the member organizations of the North

A New Occupational/Industrial
Coding System for 19th Century
U.S. Heavy Industrial Workers
Richard Healey1
Abstract
Many census occupational classification systems have been developed over the last 150 years. Availability of digital census data
sets now means such classifications can be systematically analyzed. Examination of heavy industrial workers in the full count
U.S. 1880 census, and other censuses, has revealed major problems in the attribution of occupations to industrial sectors.
This is traceable to the original enumeration process, and it particularly affects generic tradesmen such as blacksmiths and
carpenters, who worked in numerous industrial sectors. As a result, the imputation of industrial sector codes from recorded
occupations by the North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP) is substantially in error, suggesting that re-coding of existing
census records using non-census sources would be necessary for such industrial sector codes to have empirical validity. A
new occupational/industrial coding system, incorporating the NAPP-modified HISCO scheme, is presented. This system is
capable of supporting both future re-coding work, in a structured data warehouse environment, and the systematic coding
of occupational data from a range of archival sources such as company records and city directories.

Atlantic Population Project (NAPP), which have undertaken
sterling work in making large demographic data sets acces-
sible to researchers (Minnesota Population Center, 2008).
Rather, a distinction needs to be made between four potential
sources of problems in these data sets, two of which relate to
the original manual collection and processing and two to the
much later phase of conversion into digital form. The first
derives from inherent shortcomings in the collection of the
original data, while the second relates to the methodology
used for the subsequent manual classification/tabulation,
whose end products were the published census tabulations.
The third involves transcribing and data entry errors in the
digitization process and the fourth is the digital equivalent of
the manual classification problem, namely, how data fields
within the digital census records are to be coded accurately
and consistently. A further question, which has been exam-
ined in the course of several large projects, is how coding
consistency can be extended beyond national boundaries to
encompass international comparisons, although this topic
goes beyond the scope of the present discussion.
As there are numerous data fields, even in late 19th cen-
tury census records (the digital version of the U.S. 1880 cen-
sus has about 90 fields, for example), a detailed examination
of these four types of problems in relation to each data ele-
ment in turn would be a major undertaking. The focus of
attention here will therefore be restricted to an examination
of quality issues surrounding the coding and classification of
occupational and related industrial categories, and how they
can be addressed, as these are among the key types of infor-
mation utilized by researchers (e.g., Hirschman & Mogford,
2009; Sarkar, 2009). The topic will be further restricted
mainly to consideration of the U.S. 1880 census because it is
the only complete count census available for that country in
digital form and thus it is becoming widely used as a refer-
ence point for all types of historical demographic analysis,
even when earlier and later sample census data sets are also
used in combination with it (Ruggles et al., 2010; Sobek &
Dillon, 1995). That said, questions have been raised about
the possible manipulation of occupational data, at the enu-
meration and processing stages, for the young, the elderly,
and married women in this census (Carter & Sutch, 1996). It
is also recognized that the 1880 time point was part of an
extended process of "learning by doing" in the planning and
execution of decennial census-taking, so it must also be set
within this broader context.
This article begins by identifying a number of problems
inherent in the approach to coding of occupations adopted by
NAPPfor the 1880 census, and by extension for the earlier and
later census samples the latter project has also made available.
These problems point to the requirements for a new coding
system that removes the limitations identified. The main body
of the article explains the design and implementation of this
system that provides an operational basis for commencing the
long-term and difficult process of re-coding industry sector
codes in historical population censuses, which must
necessarily be undertaken using non-census sources. In the
process, it will also be made clear that the new system can be
used to classify and standardize employment and occupational
data from non-census sources independently and additionally
to its deployment in support of future work on re-coding of
industry sector information in large census data sets.
Occupational and Industrial Sector
Coding in the 1880 Census
At the outset, some examples serve to indicate why such a
study needs to be undertaken. The first relates to the U.S.
railroad sector, a very important contributor to the processes
of 19th century industrialization (Chandler, 1965; Vance,
1995). For 1880, there are two independent sources of rail-
road employment data. The first is the person-level records
from the population census, where individuals could iden-
tify themselves as working in a railroad-related occupation
(U.S. Census Office, 1883a). The second is a quite different
special report on transportation, where each railroad com-
pany was asked to notify the Census Bureau of the total
number of people in its employment (U.S. Census Office,
1883b). Although a few local short-line railroads in isolated
areas doubtless escaped enumeration, all lines of any sub-
stance could be identified relatively easily, in terms of
ensuring quite comprehensive data coverage. As the compa-
nies are all named in the report, it is also easy now, as it was
then, to check the figures against other reports made to State
Railroad Commissioners in the different states. Such checks
suggest that considerable confidence can be placed in the
reported figures, as state officials with local knowledge
would likely have been able to identify any attempts at sys-
tematic misrepresentation in the data. The final employment
total from the Census special report gives 418,957 workers
in the railroad sector.
In the digital 1880 population census from NAPP, the
original transcribed text strings describing occupations asso-
ciated with individual records have been standardized and
coded using a variant of the standard Historical International
Standard Classification of Occupations (HISCO) scheme
(explained further below) into many hundreds of numerical
categories represented by the US80A_OCC variable. A sec-
ond coding of occupations places them on a 1950 basis using
the variable US80A_OCC50US, to try and provide a consis-
tent classification across multiple censuses, although this
particular variable will not be examined here further. Of the
US80A_OCC variable values, 18 codes refer directly to dif-
ferent aspects of steam railroad work and a further three
doubtless include railroad employees, but may also overlap
with horse-drawn street railroad employment, for example,
code 36010--unspecified conductors. Counting the records
assigned to the 18 codes across the entire census yields a
total of 237,480 workers. Adding in the three less specific
categories raises the total to 251,490. The first figure very
closely matches that of 236,058 for 1880 given by Edwards
Healey 3
(1943, p. 109) in his classic article on occupational trends in
the U.S. census, though there is no documentation on exactly
how that specific figure was obtained. This does, however,
suggest that the recently developed digital coding system for
occupations closely reproduces earlier manual findings. This
would support the view that present day transcription and
coding has not introduced any significant new sources of
error, a similar finding to that reported by Woollard for work
on the historical censuses of the United Kingdom (Woollard,
1999). That said, it is apparent that the railroad employment
total based on the 18 codes is only 56.7% of the total from
the 1880 Special Report and adding the other three codes has
relatively little effect. Despite the substantial difference in
these two totals, there is no clear evidence from the literature
that this rather important disparity has ever been noticed or
made the subject of further investigation.
One possible approach to resolving the problem would
initially appear to be to use another variable from the 1880
NAPP data set, namely, the industry classification (variable
US80A_IND50US), though this classification is also on a
1950 basis for comparative purposes (cf. Ronnander, 1999).
This variable has a code (506) for "railroads and railway
express service," which has already been used in the pub-
lished literature as part of a comparison of employment
changes in industrial sectors over time, although in this case
the IPUMS census samples, which use the same industrial
codes as the full NAPP data set, were used (Hirschman &
Mogford, 2009; Ruggles et al., 2010). The industry code
only identifies 266,659 railroad employees in 1880. This is a
modest increase over the occupation code count, but it is less
apparent what the derivation of this figure is, as it does not
correspond to the earlier calculations by Edwards noted
above. Although neither the NAPP documentation nor the
standard reference on NAPP occupational coding make this
clear (Roberts, Woollard, Ronnander, Dillon, & Thorvaldsen,
2003), the industry code is necessarily very largely imputed
from the occupation data by the NAPP project and is not an
independent and additional source of data on individuals, as
there is no column in the manuscript census schedules for
industrial sector. The effect of this imputation can be seen by
cross-referencing the occupational and industrial codes
attached to individual records. Taking an example of five
industrial states (Pennsylvania, etc.), which have a total of
61,616 individuals given industry code 506, of these almost
88% have one of the 18 railroad occupation codes, a figure
that rises to 91%, if the three less specific categories are
included. Working in the other direction, nearly 99% of indi-
viduals with one of the 18 occupation codes have an indus-
trial code of 506, or nearly 97% if the wider definition is
used. Thus, in the vast majority of cases, the industry code
provides no additional information over the occupation code.
Judging by detailed examination of the original transcribed
occupation text strings (which somewhat negates the value
of having a code), the limited number of cases where the
industry code does provide additional information reflect
situations where additional non-standard text in the string in
question allowed a more precise industrial sector attribution
to be made. For example, a worker might be described as
"boilermaker in the B&O shops," which would identify him
as a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad employee for the industry
code, but under occupation he would be standardized to just
"boilermaker." The data coders have thus endeavored to
make maximum use of any data present in the census. Despite
this painstaking work, still only 63.7% of the railroad work-
force can be identified on an individual basis, leaving in
excess of 150,000 workers unaccounted for in this industrial
sector alone. Similarly, problematic findings have been
reported for the anthracite coal mining sector, a large
employer in Pennsylvania, though in this case, use of occu-
pational data gave better results than the industry variable
(Healey, 2011).
This earlier study traced the source of the discrepancies
in the employment counts to the distinction between work-
ers in generic occupations, such as blacksmiths and machin-
ists, and those in industry-specific occupations, such as coal
miners or railroad brakemen. The large numerical impact of
these discrepancies does not appear to have been recognized
in previous studies devoted to the problem of occupational
coding. In general, industry-specific occupations were quite
accurately recorded in the population census, so industry
sector can usually be imputed correctly for these workers.
However, the vast majority of generic workers in 1880 did
not give census enumerators details of the industrial sector
in which they worked, so it is not possible to impute the
industry correctly for these individuals without using non-
census sources. Part of the reason for this can be attributed
to the lack of clear instructions to enumerators about the
collection of occupational information, with the exception
of the case of railroad clerks (Healey, 2011; U.S. Census
Office, 1880). Unfortunately, instead of recognizing the
problem both in the data set and in the documentation for
the industry variable, the NAPP project has made incorrect
industry imputations for hundreds of thousands of workers
in generic occupations.
A brief analysis of the occupational/industry code combi-
nations in the entire 1880 data set makes clear how serious a
problem this is. Taking the case of blacksmiths, 99% of the
177,193 individuals are given an industry code of 817 for
"miscellaneous repair services." Only 373 blacksmiths are
coded as railroad employees, 142 to different iron and steel
related codes, and a mere five to coal mining. Such figures
are entirely incorrect and extremely misleading. For exam-
ple, a single anthracite mine (the Diamond) out of more than
100 in one of the four anthracite coalfields, employed four
blacksmiths and three blacksmith's helpers in mid-1880
(Diamond Payroll, 1880), so across both the anthracite and
bituminous mining sectors, thousands of blacksmiths would
have been employed and the same would have applied to the
other sectors named above. For machinists, the situation is
similar. Of 97,424 workers in this occupation, 97.3% were
4 SAGE Open
coded to the mysterious category of "miscellaneous machin-
ery" (code 358) and only 1,177 or 1.2% to the railroad sector.
However, the 1880 census special report has a specific break-
down of numbers of machinists (unlike blacksmiths), and it
states that 22,766 of them worked for the railroads across the
United States (U.S. Census Office, 1883b). This means that
more than 21,000 of this sub-group are misclassified.
Likewise, the Mine Inspectors' reports for 1880 record 813
"outside mechanics" employed at mines in the northern
anthracite field (calculated from data in Inspectors of Mines,
1880). While this definition may not exactly equate to
machinists, according to the NAPP data set there were no
machinists at all who worked in coal mining.
Prior to 1880, the enumerators' instructions were no more
specific than in 1880, despite a minor caution against using
"machinist" if a more precise description could be given
(U.S. Census Office, 1870, 14). After 1880, the instructions
for 1890 and 1900, which are largely the same in both years,
suggested in places the need for accurate qualification of job
titles, by means of isolated examples such as "railroad
laborer" or "carriage blacksmith," but there is no clear recog-
nition of the systematic need to distinguish generic from
industry-specific occupations. This can be seen in the com-
plete omission of generic trades (as opposed to laborers)
from the list of steam railroad occupations (U.S. Census
Office, 1900, pp. 32, 36). As a result, the same problems with
underreporting are to be expected both in the earlier and later
censuses. This is unequivocally demonstrable in the case of
1890, as there was also a special report on transportation in
this year (though not in 1900). The special report gives a
figure of 750,017 employees, but the Edwards Report only
counts 462,213 (Edwards, 1943, p. 109; U.S. Census Office,
1895, p. 130). This special report figure for 1890 is also
greatly in excess of Edward's 1900 figure of 582,150, at a
time when railroad employment was still expanding, so the
underreporting issue was still not resolved by this date.
Although attention has been focused on generic skilled
tradesmen in the previous examples, unskilled general labor-
ers also make a substantial contribution to the overall prob-
lem, because of their comparatively large numbers, and the
likelihood that their industrial sector was also not recorded
by the enumerators. Further to this, laborers in irregular
employment, say in railroad construction, may well not have
identified themselves as part of the railroad industry, even if
specifically questioned to that effect.
The much wider implication of these problems is that the
NAPP/IPUMS 1% sample census data sets for other census
years after 1850 (excluding 1890) are also subject to the same
difficulties of interpretation and inaccurate assignment of
sample individuals to industrial sectors. Any research find-
ings based on these specific industrial codes may therefore be
very much in error, and these errors are unlikely to be consis-
tent between different industrial sectors. The potential impact
on studies of inter-sectoral mobility is substantial. The same
applies to inter-censal analyses of changing occupational/
industrial structure based on aggregate statistics, or of detailed
occupational mobility, based on linked samples derived from
NAPP or IPUMS data sets. This is apparent, because there is
no means of determining from census records alone, whether
occupational information about given linked individuals was
recorded in the same way in successive censuses, so workers
may appear to be railroad employees in one census but not the
next, when their employment status did not actually change.
Further to this, sampling from undifferentiated occupational
groupings, when those same groupings actually contain dif-
ferent sub-populations of individuals in different industrial
sectors, may be a source of concealed bias in statistical stud-
ies. For example, it has already been shown that railroad
machinists and blacksmiths in Baltimore in 1860 had differ-
ent socio-demographic characteristics than their non-railroad
counterparts (Healey, Thomas, & Lahman, 2013). It is there-
fore most important that these coding issues are more widely
discussed and analyzed, to prevent inappropriate analyses
being undertaken that generate misleading or false results. A
further inference is that historical census data sets, standardly
viewed as "givens" for secondary data analysis, should more
accurately be viewed as "works in progress," resources whose
data quality needs to be enhanced progressively over time, by
means of comparison with other sources, to increase the con-
fidence that can be placed in analytical results derived from
them. This is not a welcome finding for research funding bod-
ies, who would doubtless have wished that researchers could
capitalize on their past investments in large data sets without
the need for ongoing expenditure on quality improvement. It
also leaves some individual researchers in a quandary, as it is
now clear that the coded data presently available cannot sup-
port certain types of analyses that would previously have
been deemed viable. They can either restrict the scope of their
work (e.g., by avoiding use of industrial sector codes) or
shoulder the rigorous additional burden of making the
required data quality enhancements using non-census sources.
While the latter may be a feasible strategy for well-resourced
work with limited geographical coverage, it is infeasible for
individuals wishing to engage in larger-scale studies. Also, in
the absence of any agreed approach to the use of non-census
sources or how any re-coding might be undertaken, there is
serious risk of incompatibilities quickly arising between stud-
ies, which will greatly hinder future comparative work.
Where studies only make use of very broad occupational cat-
egories (e.g., Ferrie, 2005), the impact of these detailed prob-
lems may be lessened, but it can no longer be assumed that
they do not exist.
Requirements for a New Coding
System
To address this unwelcome situation in a systematic manner,
a new approach is required to the problem of quality enhance-
ment of existing historical census data sets, such as the NAPP
1880 census. This involves several initial steps. The first of
Healey 5
these is to provide an overview of the main types of non-cen-
sus sources that may eventually contribute to the re-coding
process. The second is to evaluate what new developments, in
terms of coding capabilities, are required to mesh together
census and non-census sources. The third is to identify a suit-
able computational methodology or methodologies that will
support these new capabilities. The fourth is to identify opera-
tional considerations that could facilitate the take-up of new
coding system capabilities, and finally, there is the need to
outline future possibilities for systematic re-coding projects
(e.g., of specific industrial sectors) of sufficient substance to
demonstrate unambiguously the full nature and extent of the
data quality problems for the sectors in question, and to pro-
vide guides to assist subsequent projects aimed at other sec-
tors. The main emphasis of the present discussion will be on
the first three of these steps, followed by a brief commentary
on the remaining two stages, the implementation of which
lies, at least in part, in the future.
The first question to address is which other non-census
sources are available to assist with census (re-)coding. A
range of these can be identified in the U.S. context, but they
vary widely in their temporal, geographical, and sectoral
coverage and indeed their degree of comprehensiveness,
even for specific locations and time points. Among the most
obvious candidates are city directories, company payrolls,
marriage and death records, and naturalization records. Less
obvious candidates would include the harrowing industrial
accident records found in state railroad commission reports
and mine inspectors' reports. While space precludes a
detailed survey of these sources, several brief comments
serve to highlight relevant issues. The census has the enor-
mous advantage of relative geographical comprehensive-
ness over a broadly comparable time interval (the concept of
a precise census date was not well-developed in earlier
years), and provides information on age, family, and house-
hold status, occupation and birthplace. Marriage and death
records will provide a subset of this information possibly
with links to parental names. Company records, such as pay-
rolls, being employment-focused, lack much of this infor-
mation, including age-related data (though this may be
found in employee card indexes). However, this is offset by
the detailed work history information they contain.
Directories, though largely confined to urban areas, have
varying degrees of comprehensiveness for the populations
they served, lack age or family data, but provide addresses
and often contain valuable employment-related information
for multiple time-slices falling between census years. The
potential research benefits of being able to combine data
about individuals over time and space from these and other
relevant sources are easy to see, though the practical prob-
lems of achieving the required data linkage in a reliable
manner may be quite another matter.
To examine some of these sources in more detail, experi-
ence with city directories, for example, suggests they are
most informative for occupational purposes in the 1850s to
1870s, rather than in later years, and the larger the city the
less informative, owing to pressure on space in individual
volumes. By more informative, is meant more likely to pro-
vide not only an occupation for each individual, but also an
industrial sector or even specific manufacturing establish-
ment/company department (e.g., foreman of the car repair
shop of a specific named railroad). Comprehensiveness of
population coverage probably increased over time, as direc-
tory compilers became more organized and better funded,
though systematic studies of this are largely lacking
(Goldstein, 1954). Payrolls are usually much more detailed,
though far more sporadic in space and time. Thus, only a
small fraction of 19th century anthracite mines have surviv-
ing payrolls, and regrettably even fewer railroads, but the
documents that do survive, will reveal much finer job sub-
divisions than "coal miner" or "railroad hand." They may
also indicate the department of the company in which
employees worked, and provide information on how they
were paid (piece-work or hourly) and the regularity of work
over shorter or longer periods, depending on the length of
surviving records. The clear advantage of payroll records,
and indeed industrial accident records, because the informa-
tion is firm specific, is that they are guaranteed to address the
problem of identifying generic workers in specific industrial
sectors at particular dates. This is not standardly the case for
city directories, although some early volumes do contain a
good deal of the requisite information.
Setting aside questions about relative ease of processing
of printed versus manuscript sources, and the major topic of
nominal record linkage between different sources (for a
review, see Winkler, 2006), which are beyond the present
scope, key requirements for an occupational coding system
that facilitates re-coding of census records using non-census
data can now be identified, based on the range of information
that may be available in different types of non-census
sources. First, and most importantly, the system must enable
workers in generic occupations to be "tagged" with their spe-
cific industrial sector, where known. Second, it should extend
beyond the rather general occupational categories favored by
census enumerators and "genealogical" sources, such as
marriage records, to encapsulate the greater range of employ-
ment information provided by payrolls, industrial accident
records, and many early directories. This information
includes detailed job titles, major and minor sub-divisions
within companies and whether employees were engaged in
construction work or activity related to production/opera-
tion. Thus, the system should be able to distinguish black-
smiths involved in railroad construction from those employed
in the operation of rolling mills in the iron industry. Such
distinctions are impossible to make with the version of the
HISCO coding system used for the U.S. 1880 census and the
samples from earlier and later censuses. This is the main rea-
son why a new system is required. Further to this, however,
if non-census sources are to be used, it is sensible to abstract
as much relevant information on employment structure from
6 SAGE Open
them in a single pass as possible, to avoid the need to keep
referring back to them for more detailed information. In this
sense, the resulting occupational/industrial code then serves
as a kind of employment structure index to the archival
source (e.g., a payroll), in addition to its main function as a
classificatory device. This proves to have wider implica-
tions, as will be seen below. At the same time, the wide usage
of the HISCO system means that backward compatibility
with it should also be provided by the new system. Relating
detailed job titles to the more general HISCO categories also
obviates the necessity for a separate look-up table of indi-
vidual titles. Finally, unlike some of the older systems devel-
oped in the pre-Internet era, it will be assumed that the
system can take full advantage of a range of readily available
digital and database-related technologies, including Web
connectivity.
Focus of the New Coding System
As Wrigley has correctly observed, there is no right or wrong
in terms of coding systems, but each will have a particular
class of problems to which it is especially well suited
(Wrigley, n.d.). In his case, Wrigley adopted a focus on the
distinction between primary, secondary, and tertiary (PST)
sectors in the economy, because of a particular interest in the
changing relative importance of these sectors over the long
term as the Industrial Revolution progressed. Herschberg, in
contrast, seems to have sought an all-encompassing census
coding system, with a certain focus on industrial sectors,
though his precise aims are not very clearly articulated, and
there is no recognition of the problems caused by lack of
specificity in the occupational/industrial sector enumeration
of generic workers (Herschberg, 1976). In the present sys-
tem, a particular, though not exclusive, focus is on the ques-
tion of occupational and geographical mobility of heavy
industrial workers. This has many facets, as workers can
change jobs within and between industrial concerns in the
same sector or utilize existing generic skills in new ways by
changing industrial sector, for example, a machinist moving
from the mining to the railroad industry. Such occupational
movements, which may be upward, horizontal, or occasion-
ally downwards, in terms of the job and remuneration hierar-
chy, may or may not be accompanied by geographical
mobility. Changes of location in pursuit of career advance-
ment have been characterized as a major feature of the
"American Dream" (cf. Ferrie, 1995, 1999) and thus the
problem of mobility touches on a wide range of debates
about immigration and 19th century economic growth
(Thomas, 1973).
A focus on occupational mobility has also been the pre-
ferred approach in relation to the U.S. Department of Labor
Dictionary of Occupational Titles (Miller, Trieman, Cain, &
Roos, 1980). A substantial body of work on coding systems,
both for the U.S. census and for inter-agency work within the
U.S. Government, undertaken in the first half of the 20th
century and summarized by Palmer (1939), concluded that
rigorous and consistent classification based on a distinction
between skilled and unskilled work was infeasible. In con-
trast, both Herschberg (1976) and Morris (1990), in the U.K.
context, have stressed the need for any coding system to
reflect both occupational characteristics and industrial sector
affiliation. This is particularly significant, as the NAPP-
modified HISCO system (Roberts et al., 2003) does not do
this as part of its structure, though some specialized occupa-
tions will tend to be associated with particular industrial
categories.
General Design Criteria for the New
System
There are four general design criteria for the system that
need to be explained prior to detailed treatment of the indi-
vidual components of the overall structure. The first derives
from the requirement stated above that the system must be
able to code both census/vital registration records and occu-
pational data from industrial/company records. The HISCO
system was only developed on the basis of the former type of
data (Van Leeuwen, Maas, & Miles, 2004). Second, as the
coding system is intended to capture the more detailed infor-
mation derived from company records and some city directo-
ries, it should be able to do this in a way that facilitates
analysis of occupational mobility within industrial sectors, as
well as among them. None of the systems in current use sup-
port this type of analysis. The third criterion is that a single
code will be used, rather than a multi-component code, as in
the case of the PST and Herschberg systems. Likewise, as
noted earlier, NAPP data sets have separate industrial and
occupational codes. The present codes therefore span both
industrial sector and occupational categories. While this may
initially appear to hairsplitting, it proves to be of major
importance in implementation terms. The final criterion is
that the coding system is strictly hierarchical, even if this
makes it appear "verbose" in places. The combination of
these two criteria allows this system, unlike its predecessors,
to be used in the exacting implementation environment of a
properly constructed data warehouse, where in-built Online
Analytical Processing (OLAP) functions allow automated
aggregation and dis-aggregation of categories and sub-cate-
gories of data, based on different hierarchical levels in the
occupational coding of individual records (Healey, 2011).
Within the overall structure, there are eight hierarchical lev-
els, as indicated in Table 1. As with all such systems, there is
no intrinsic validity to this number of levels, but it was found
in pilot tests on different industry sectors that it allowed for
considerable detail about the nature of employment catego-
ries within industrial concerns to be captured, as well as
inter-sector differences. This is obviously of particular value
when working with company records, which have not formed
the basis of the better-known systems reported in the litera-
ture. Each level is represented by a specific number of digits
Healey 7
in the code, the number of digits varying between levels, as
required. In the first version of the system, the overall code is
14 digits long. Simple database string manipulation func-
tions allow any level sub-code or combination of sub-codes
to be selected, in addition to the entire code, so it is very flex-
ible in use. The individual levels will now be examined in
more detail, and the full implementation can be examined
online (Healey, 2010).
Individual-Level Sub-Codes
From Table 1, it is apparent that the numbering of levels
runs from the highest at 8 (the most general) to 1 (the lowest
and most disaggregated). Level 8 (2 digits) is the broadest
level of industrial classification in the system. Comparison
with other systems shows a great variety of methods of clas-
sifying industrial sectors. For 19th century purposes,
Herschberg (1976), for example, found earlier releases of
the present day Standard Industrial Classification (SIC; U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, 2011) to contain
anachronisms. The SIC also omits categories now unimport-
ant, but previously extremely large, for example, anthracite
coal mining. Equally, the industrial codes used by NAPP
correspond to the system set out by the Bureau of the Census
in 1950 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1950). Necessarily
designed primarily for 20th rather than 19th century census
coding, this system is subject to exactly the same criticisms
leveled at the SIC codes above, for example, it merges
anthracite and bituminous mining, fails to distinguish canal
transportation from other kinds of transportation on inland
waterways and groups blast furnaces, steel works, and roll-
ing mills together into a single code. It also provides guid-
ance on which occupations fall within which industrial
sectors, but in the present context some of its specific direc-
tives are very problematic, such as the instruction to include
mine laborers under the very general and uninformative cat-
egory of "operatives and kindred workers," rather than
under the still too broad category of "coal mining" (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1950, p. xx). Given the rather limited
attention, apparently given in this system to proper hierar-
chical structuring of the codes into major and minor catego-
ries, and the problems listed above, there is little to be gained
(and a good deal to lose) by trying to match the 1950 indus-
trial codes to those used here. Indeed, by deliberately mak-
ing the present codes quite different, it reinforces the
argument above that the 1950 codes, as deployed by NAPP,
contain limited useful information which reduces their value
for detailed analytical purposes. As the coding system has
primarily been established for heavy industrial workers, in
the first instance, the Level 8 categories currently imple-
mented include coal mining, iron and steel, and transporta-
tion.These categories are more than sufficient to demonstrate
the structure and operation of the overall system.
Level 7 (1 digit) provides appropriate sub-categories of the
main industries. Thus, coal mining is currently divided into
anthracite and bituminous mining. To the non-specialist, this
may appear unnecessary. However, the marked difference in
the ratios of "inside" (underground) to "outside" workers and
the major differences in the range of outside occupations
between the two sub-categories provide the rationale for this.
Anthracite coal requires extensive processing and sorting into
size fractions in a "coal breaker" after being hoisted to the
surface, whereas bituminous coal does not, so the range of
occupational types and the number of outside employees is
much larger in the former case (DiCiccio, 1996). This level
also distinguishes primary iron manufacture from steelmak-
ing, a necessary distinction even after more integrated iron
and steel works began to appear from the late 1860s to early
1870s onward in the United States (Temin, 1964). In the
transportation category, railroads are currently implemented,
but additional sub-categories will obviously be required in
future, for canal workers and employees in other forms of
navigation on inland waterways, both major rivers and the
Great Lakes.
Level 6 (1 digit) makes the important distinction between
workers who are engaged in productive enterprise and those
who are responsible for the construction of mines, mills, and
conduits of transportation, such as railroad lines or canals.
There are many reasons for wanting to maintain such a dis-
tinction. For example, construction activity, following on
from investment decisions, was broadly cyclic in nature and
could attract hundreds or even thousands of workers to spe-
cific localities for extended periods of time, running into
years for large mining or railroad developments (Healey
et al., 2013). However, once construction was completed and
productive operations began, the nature of employment
opportunities could change rapidly, necessitating substantial
geographical mobility of labor, in search of continuing work.
For example, various stages of wooden coal breaker con-
struction required large numbers of carpenters, but once a
specific mine was in operation, the demand for these generic
tradesmen at that location dropped sharply (and standard car-
pentry skills were not immediately transferable to
Table 1. Hierarchy of Levels in the New Coding System.

the specialized job of "inside timber-man," responsible for
shoring up underground mine workings). Accurate identifi-
cation of construction workers is much more likely to be pos-
sible when payroll information is available, although
justifiable inferences can also be made under appropriate
circumstances, for example, when a city directory lists a
worker employed at a specific mine and it is known from
other sources that this mine is under construction at the time
in question. Examination of the NAPP 1880 data set suggests
that industrial construction activity is very largely hidden
from view, not least because the vast majority of the large
cadre of construction laborers are simply reported under the
generic laborer codes.
Level 5 and Level 4 (each 1 digit) enable increasingly
detailed tracking of the main and detailed sub-divisions/
department within a company where individual employees
worked and, depending on the particular industry sub-sector,
their relationship to their employer in contractual terms.
Taken together, they represent an important contribution to
coding methodology, because such information is largely
lacking from all the standardly used systems (even
Herschberg's extensive coding structure does not approach
the level of detail captured here). Where the necessary data
to inform the coding is available, these levels can be used to
analyze horizontal and vertical occupational mobility of
workers within a single large firm. This mobility may also
have an important geographical component if the firm oper-
ates on multiple sites. While the best choice of level at which
to make certain sub-divisions may be arguable, pilot testing
indicated that Level 5 should be used for major sub-divisions
of productive activity and Level 4 for more detailed sub-divi-
sions. Not all industry sectors would necessarily require use
of both levels, in which case a "pass-through" mechanism is
deployed, whereby the classification from the level above is
simply repeated one level down. This is an example of how
the code may appear verbose or slightly redundant in some
instances, but the advantages of a standardized hierarchical
structure, common to all industries, greatly outweighs any
minor lack of elegance in implementation. Thus, at Level 5,
the iron industry sub-divides into different types of activity,
which may or may not be found on the same site. These
include blast furnaces, rolling mills, and foundries. At Level
4 in rolling mills, for example, contract or piece-workers are
separated from workers paid a daily wage. A somewhat anal-
ogous process applies to anthracite mining, where Level 5
separates inside from outside workers, and with Level 4
inside workers, "company men" paid a daily or monthly
wage are coded differently to contract miners, paid by the car
of coal mined and loaded. These distinctions are immedi-
ately apparent when processing anthracite mine payrolls and
present very few problems of interpretation under these cir-
cumstances. In the absence of such archival sources, it may
be very difficult to benefit fully from these coding distinc-
tions, as neither the census nor city directories report at this
level of detail and the undifferentiated term of "coal miner"
or even just "miner" is normally found. For railroads, Level
5 currently serves as a pass-through, but Level 4 is very
important because it is used to reflect the standard depart-
mental and accounting breakdown that came to be used on
most railroads during the 19th century. The main sub-divi-
sions are Conducting Transportation, Maintenance of Way,
and Motive Power. The first of these is concerned with the
daily operation of train services, both freight and passenger.
Maintenance of Way covers all track and depot repairs and
Motive Power refers to the building and repair of locomo-
tives and rolling stock and all associated engine-house and
machine shop functions. An early reference to such a clas-
sificatory scheme, crediting the Georgia Railroad as the orig-
inator, can be found in the 1850 annual report of the
Pennsylvania Railroad (Pennsylvania Railroad, 1851).
Initially, "maintenance of cars" was treated as a separate
department, but over time this was merged into the "motive
power" heading. With minor variations, the scheme was
widely adopted by the 1880s. For coding purposes, the
scheme has been extended to include a category of "General
Administration," as, by convention, these administrative
employees and company officers were not included in the
threefold sub-division above. There are also "catch-all" cat-
egories for employees for whom detailed information is not
available. Interestingly, in cases where payrolls are available
for years prior to the adoption of the scheme by a given rail-
road, aggregation of individual lower-level job codes (see
below) to these Level 4 categories has already been shown to
provide a very effective standardized means of analyzing the
changing employment structure of a given railroad over
time. By extension, it can also be used effectively for system-
atic comparison of the structure of different railroads (Healey
et al., 2013).
The lowest three levels (1-3) are designed to provide
compatibility with the NAPP-modified HISCO coding sys-
tem, while also enabling this system to be extended substan-
tially to include the much wider range of specific occupations
found in non-census records. The maximum possible com-
patibility is sought, subject to the constraints of a strictly
hierarchical coding system. While HISCO very largely meets
these requirements, there are occasions where lack of consis-
tency or other considerations required slight modifications to
be made or minor re-naming to take place. The effects of
these changes are limited, however, so the overwhelming
majority of HISCO codes can be readily identified within the
new system. However, some modifications that do require
highlighting at the outset are that the codes as they appear on
the NAPP list have an additional digit to the left and two to
the right of the code in the present system. Partly, as a conse-
quence of this, the division of the code into levels for hierar-
chical decomposition differs slightly from that in the original
HISCO scheme. In the latter, codes have the form 9.99.99,
where 9 is the placeholder. The highest level (one digit) rep-
resents major groups, the middle-level (two digits) minor
groups, and the lowest level (two digits) the individual
Healey 9
occupational categories (Van Leeuwen et al., 2004). In the
present scheme, the structure is 09.9.99900, using zeroes to
show the new digits, but, as can be seen, the five HISCO
digits remain, though divided slightly differently.
Examining the new expanded structure above, Level 3 (2
digits) corresponds to the HISCO major groups, which can
be given broad labels such as "Professional and Technical"
(sub-code 01) or "Production, Construction and Transport"
(sub-code 09). The additional digit is used to provide a 10th
category, not found in HISCO, which cover the varied
instances where occupation is lacking, but useful informa-
tion is still provided, for example, for retired persons. This
permits inclusion within the code of data that in the HISCO
scheme is separated out into multiple additional variables
such as STATUS or RELATION, that do not form part of the
main code structure (Van Leeuwen et al., 2004). Level 2 (1
digit) provides a middle-level breakdown, corresponding to
the first part of the HISCO minor grouping, although it is
argued that the categories used here are much more obvious
than in the NAPP/HISCO code list (NAPP Code List, 2013)
and have been given clear labels. For example, under the
Level 3 sub-code 09 for inside company workers in anthra-
cite mines, the Level 2 sub-categories are mine development
workers (095), stationary engine operators (096), transport
equipment operators (098), and workers not elsewhere clas-
sified (099). Comparison with the NAPP code list immedi-
ately shows how the present system aims to preserve
compatibility with HISCO wherever possible, but does not
allow the latter to restrict necessary extensions/modifications
to the code structure. Thus, HISCO has no equivalent of
mine development workers, as it lacks sufficient detail to
code them separately. Consequently, the codes in HISCO
beginning with 95, which relate to various types of building
work, are deployed in this specific branch of the system con-
cerned with mining, to refer to "building" work inside the
mine, which is necessary for mine development under-
ground, but which is not actual mining of coal. In contrast,
major types of stationary engine operators can be readily
identified in the NAPP list as codes starting with 96, so these
can be deployed directly in the current system, but with the
additional interpretation at this point, derived from the higher
levels of the code, that they are stationary engine operators
working inside a mine. The same type of argument can be
applied to the other Level 2 sub-categories in this example.
At Level 1 (5 digits), considerable additional detail about
specific individual occupations can be coded. The first three
of these digits comprise the remainder of the full HISCO
code for the occupation in question, assuming it appears in
the NAPP code list. The final two digits provide the ability to
add extensive refinements of the HISCO occupational cate-
gories, based on additional information from company
records, or to add new codes for jobs that are not found in the
NAPP code list. Thus, to continue with the stationary engine
operators example for inside mining employees, the full
NAPP/HISCO code for "Stationary engineers and engine
men" is 96230. This appears as an entry in the present sys-
tem, as 09623000, to show that the full NAPP/HISCO code
is embedded in this more expanded code. However, other
sub-categories, such as "donkey runner" (for operator of
auxiliary "donkey" engine) or pump-man, neither of which
have NAPP/HISCO equivalents, appear as sub-codes of sta-
tionary engine operator, that is, sub-codes 09623010 and
09623040, respectively. For clarity, their full codes, showing
all levels, are 10111109623010 and 10111109623040. As all
digit positions are fixed in the code, it is a trivial database
operation to select all codes that refer to stationary engineers,
wherever they appear under different branches of the system,
such as inside mines, in blast furnaces, or in railroad motive
power divisions. This means that the system can immedi-
ately be used to generate aggregate occupational statistics
that are compatible with those that can be derived from the
NAPP census data sets. Table 2 provides a further illustration
of the overall structure of the coding system, using an exam-
ple of workers in a rolling mill and following this specific
occupational sub-tree down through the eight levels. The
three dots ". . ." in several cells in the table indicate that there
are additional categories at the level in question, which are
not shown for reasons of clarity.
Expanding the Range of Occupational
Titles--Coding Issues and Data Sources
Within the coding system, the occupational description that
accompanies each code at the lowest level may be derived
from a variety of sources. The more generic job titles cor-
respond to those in the NAPP/HISCO system and are read-
ily identifiable as a result. However, as previous studies
have pointed out, the NAPP/HISCO coverage of occupa-
tional types found within different industrial sectors is very
variable. Thus, there are 18 different NAPP/HISCO codes
specifically associated with railroads, but only two codes for
the mining industry (71120 "miners," which unhelpfully
includes both coal and ore miners, and the general and very
rarely used 71190 "others working in mines and quarries").
The rather unclear code 71200 "mineral or stone treaters"
might also be partially relevant, but it is not obvious from
the code list whether this relates to mining activity as nor-
mally understood (see below). This comprehensive failure
to recognize the occupational complexity of the mining
industry was particularly striking to the present writer,
because earlier unrelated analysis of anthracite mine pay-
rolls in the 1880s and 1890s had already shown that about
200 distinct types of work could be identified without any
difficulty. More recent work on payrolls from the 1860s, as
this coding system was developed, and mine inspectors'
reports from the 1870s onward has further extended this list
of job types to around 300 in total, not all of which are yet
incorporated in the system (Healey, 2013).
Also, in an attempt to clarify the use of the code 71200 in
the NAPP 1880 census data set, the detailed occupational
10 SAGE Open
transcriptions for workers with this code were examined on a
sample basis. This revealed interesting and important lessons
in the present context, both for those engaged in the coding
of census occupations, and subsequent users of the coded
data. As noted earlier, a unique characteristic of anthracite
mines was the requirement to prepare the coal for market in
large "breakers" on the surface (Hudson Coal Company,
1932). This meant that large numbers of boys (and some
elderly ex-miners) were employed at each anthracite mine to
help with this preparation process, which was only partially
mechanized in the 19th century. Many thousands of these
"breaker boys" or "slate pickers" (so-called because they
removed rock or "slate" from the coal before it was loaded
into railroad cars) were employed in the anthracite coalfields,
but not in the bituminous mining regions, where breakers
were not required. In the NAPP data set, these boys have
almost all been coded to 71200. This separates them from
"miners" per se and their NAPP/HISCO occupational
description tends to mislead rather than inform, as they are
never described as "mineral treaters" in the mining literature.
The rationale for this coding decision is also much more
apparent following the above explanation of the work of
breaker boys, than it is when examining a code list to identify
potential mining industry employees, as one group among
many chosen for analysis. Put another way, if it is necessary
to utilize detailed industry knowledge and the original occu-
pational transcriptions to understand the use of a code, then
it is probably not a very effective numerical shorthand.
Further to this, from an industrial sector perspective, use of
71200 confounds coal mining-related activity with unrelated
stone-dressing in quarries or mineral ore processing to an
unknown degree in any county data set, though it is fortunate
that anthracite is only mined in a very limited number of U.S.
counties. In contrast, these breaker boys are always reported
as an integral part of the anthracite mining industry, both in
mine inspectors' reports and in company payrolls them-
selves. The present system therefore identifies them under
the code 10112209900220, which specifies that they are
anthracite industry employees paid by the day to work
outside the mine in the coal breaker. To avoid perpetuating
the confusion generated by the 71200 code, a different code
not used by NAPP/HISCO, namely 99000, has been used
here, to provide the basis for sub-codes to match the lengthy
list of job types found in coal breakers.
Although the NAPP/HISCO codes are more informative
and differentiated for the railroad than the mining sector, the
18 codes still only represent a small fraction of the job types
actually found in railroad employment. They are excellent
for trainmen, who would fall under the "conducting transpor-
tation" heading, but not for the generic trades more promi-
nently found in railroad shops, who were classified under
"motive power." To remedy this deficiency and provide a
more balanced coverage of occupational types across the
sector, two main sources were used to provide a list of about
300 job titles. These include the published payroll lists of the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which cover the years 1842 to
1857 (Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, 1842, 1852,
1858) and the reports of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Industrial
Statistics (PBIS; Secretary of Internal Affairs, 1877, 1881).
The latter are especially important, as they contain details of
the occupational structure, including job titles, of large num-
bers of different railroads, large and small, within the state
during the 1870s and 1880s. Although no set of listings can
be considered exhaustive, comparison of the returns for the
different railroads in Pennsylvania with those of the
Baltimore and Ohio in Maryland and Virginia provides an
excellent basis for the railroad job titles to be coded in the
present system. Most importantly, unlike NAPP/HISCO, this
list is not biased toward the trainmen, and provides good
coverage not only across all the three main departments of
railroad operation but also extending to categories of railroad
construction workers, as these were recorded in the large
payroll list of the Baltimore and Ohio in 1857.
The PBIS returns are not limited to railroad reports, and
they also provide details of employment in bituminous coal
mines, in primary iron and steel manufacturing concerns, and
in rolling mills. These have been utilized within the coding sys-
tem, and, as would be expected, a distinction is made between

workers with otherwise similar titles, depending on whether
they were employed at blast furnaces or in foundries and so on.
Overall, across the various sectors, the system currently
has 2,372 occupational entries, each of which has the eight
levels of the hierarchical code structure attached, making
nearly 19,000 code values, though the number of different
job titles is much smaller (814), because generic occupa-
tions, such as machinist, will be found under several sector
and sub-sector headings. Any user would only use the 2,372
Level 1 codes; the others are used by the data warehouse in
which the code system is embedded. In any primary data
source, a number of individuals will have incomplete
employment attribution, for example some blacksmiths may
be known to be employed by a given iron and steel works,
but it is not stated whether they worked at the blast furnace
or the foundry. To allow for this, every level of breakdown
enables workers without a more precise lower-level classifi-
cation to be coded as "unspecified" and the numbering con-
vention is standardized for this (codes end in "95").
Examples would be "Inside Mine Worker Unspecified
Occupation" or "Bloomery Worker Unspecified
Occupation." Further to this, there are a group of codes for
generic occupations in industries other than those currently
handled in detail. These codes still convey slightly more
information than their HISCO equivalents, as identified
workers in these occupations in the main heavy industry cat-
egories have already been separated out. For example, they
allow coding of individuals, who are recorded in city direc-
tories as carpenters in furniture manufacturing plants. This
flags the existence of some additional information in the
original sources about these workers, should that be needed.
If such industries as furniture are specifically coded in
future, these workers can be retrieved from the data set and
given more precise codes at that time. Where no industrial
sector attribution is available, separate codes again are
available to cover individuals who are simply recorded as
"carpenters" or "blacksmiths," and there are the usual
"catch-all" codes for individuals who lack the information
to enable them to be otherwise usefully classified.
While the hierarchical structure closely guides the coding
process, the opportunity has been taken to standardize cer-
tain code components to facilitate the retrieval of individuals
with particular employment characteristics that may span
multiple occupations. For example, all titles that include the
word "helper" or "assistant" end in the digit "1" at the lowest
level. However, as an assistant master of machinery is a very
different level of job than a blacksmith's helper, the fixed
number of digits in each code means that the simple applica-
tion of a format mask to the code allows assistants in super-
visory posts to be distinguished easily from helpers in
standard trades. A similar convention applies to apprentices,
all the codes of which end with the digit "2." This approach
equates to that used by Herschberg, but differs from HISCO,
where such qualifying information would have to be found in
the separate STATUS code.
Operational Use of the New Coding
System
As noted at the outset, the new coding system is a key com-
ponent of a future process of what might be termed occupa-
tional accuracy improvement for historical census data sets.
This is a long-term goal, which must be approached sys-
tematically, if it is to have any likelihood of success. It will
undoubtedly require work by a number of research groups
and will increasingly deploy the methods of citizen science
or crowd sourcing, whereby large numbers of individuals
contribute limited packages of work that amount in total to
a major research contribution. However, crowd sourcing
approaches take time to establish and gather momentum. In
the interim, a pilot project has been launched by the present
author, focused on major urban centers in the American
Manufacturing Belt, such as the cities of Cleveland, Ohio
and Scranton and Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania to examine
the potential for extracting additional information from city
directories, and where available, company records, and
matching it to census records. As would be expected from
the foregoing, the emphasis is on the railroad, mining and
iron and steel sectors, which, to differing degrees, formed a
major part of the industrial base of these and similar cities.
This combination of specific geographical locations and
selected industrial sectors means that the resulting data sets
will be valuable in their own right as case study examples
and become increasingly so, as the scope for comparability
between cities and sectors grows over time. Further to this,
as employment in these sectors was heavily concentrated in
and around these cities in the Manufacturing Belt as late as
1880 and beyond, these new data sets will progressively
create growing collections of re-coded data. One of the
future uses of these collections will be to determine the pos-
sibility of applying correction factors to other data still to
be re-coded, to improve estimated findings based originally
on the latter. When re-coded occupational/industrial data
are added in bulk to an existing census data warehouse, it
will also become possible to compare tabulations based on
the original codings with those based on the quality
enhanced, re-coded data.
Preliminary findings indicate the feasibility of abstracting
many thousands of new data records from city directories,
though accurate matching to census records is a resource-
intensive process. It has also been found, as was anticipated,
that managing lengthy numerical codes in the course of man-
ual coding of directory and other data, is problematic for the
personnel involved, though the subsequent computational
use of the numerical codes is very straightforward and effec-
tive. To bridge this operational gap, while retaining the con-
siderable database/data warehouse benefits of the numerical
codes, a structured set of mnemonic character abbreviations
has been devised, and the railroad sector is being used as a
first test of their effectiveness. These abbreviations corre-
spond to the relevant sections of numerical codes,
12 SAGE Open
so automated conversion can be undertaken, but unlike the
latter, early experience shows they are finding ready accep-
tance for manual coding purposes. This is facilitated by the
fact that a limited group of occupations, such as brakeman
(mnemonic = rrb) and conductor (mnemonic = rrcn) in the
railroad sector, account for a significant proportion of all
employees, so the most frequently used mnemonic codes can
be memorized quickly through repetition. After testing is
completed, these mnemonics and the conversion tables will
be made publicly available in the same way as has already
been undertaken for the numerical codes, so other research

Conclusion
The system resolves the key shortcomings of the HISCO
coding system, by encompassing it within a much more
sophisticated structure that allows comprehensive coding of
data from both census and non-census sources, to a level of
detail compatible with that provided in the original source
documents. As it includes the HISCO codes, it maintains a
very high level of compatibility with that approach, yet
avoids the necessity for separate look-up tables, as provided
by Wrigley for the PST system (Wrigley, n.d.). However, as
Wrigley has helpfully provided such tables, this also means
that a high degree of compatibility exists with that system
also, by deploying these intermediate tables in conjunction
with standard database queries. The new system has the
important ability to standardize employment data from com-
pany payrolls and other industrial archives, as well as coding
census and vital registration records. The fine breakdown of
employment characteristics that it provides offers a much
more nuanced approach to the analysis of inter-departmental,
inter-sectoral, and geographical mobility than is possible
using other coding systems. A further important motivation
for its original development was to allow comparison of the
demographic characteristics of sub-populations of generic
workers in different industrial sectors and this capability has
already been demonstrated in a small case study in Baltimore
(Healey et al., 2013). Further work on re-coding selected
data from the 1880 census in a data warehouse context is
planned to develop this approach on a larger scale.
Future Development of the Coding
System
While an exhaustive list of occupational titles for different
U.S. industrial sectors in the 19th century is probably an
unattainable goal, a very comprehensive list can eventually
be arrived at through comparison of multiple sources, both
printed and archival. While much of the groundwork for this
has been laid for the heavy industrial sectors, more can still
be achieved by incorporating data from two late 19th century
sources. The first of these is the report of the Commissioner
of Labor (1890), on railroad labor, which contains complete
lists of job titles for a small sample of major railroad systems
across the country. While the vast majority of the common
titles listed in this source are already in the system, some of
the less common ones are not. The second is the Weeks
Report and the associated database (Meyer, 2004; Weeks,
1884), which contains a large number of job titles in different
industrial sectors, though it makes no claim of completeness.
Ideally, more payroll information would also be incorpo-
rated, although payrolls both for railroads and large iron/
steel works are surprisingly difficult to locate in any quantity
for the latter part of the 19th century (see Knowles (2013) for
examples of the use of earlier iron company records).
Another issue is that, over time, certain titles fell into dis-
use, or persisted in some regions but not others, or the nature
of the work activity that they represented changed quite sig-
nificantly, as technology moved forward. The original largely
European focus of the HISCO system raises further questions,
as many U.S. occupational titles differed from their British
equivalents (measured in terms of the tasks involved) or the
English translation of French or German terms may not cor-
respond to U.S. usage of the word in question. Hence, there is
a wider research agenda, not well-articulated in the literature,
than the narrower field of comparability between occupations
recorded in censuses internationally. As the new coding sys-
tem aims to include original job titles, not a subset of standard-
ized categories, it also has the potential to act as an index to
more extensive textual resources that describe the "task lists"
of apparently equivalent jobs in different companies, sectors,
and locations and how these evolve or change over time. This
would be a useful extension to the helpful occupational
descriptions and illustrations already provided online for
HISCO codes (History of Work Information System, 2013).
Some progress in this direction has already been made, in
terms of identifying published descriptions of railroad jobs in
a range of companies from the 1860s onward. While time-
consuming to develop such a textual resource, it is straightfor-
ward to link it directly to the online version of the coding
system. This would also serve to encourage contributions from
the wider scholarly community to extend the resource, as this
would be of considerable value for future studies of work and
labor in the United States during the 19th century.

William G. Thomas, Department of History and the students, staff,
faculty, and directors at the Center for Digital Research in the
Humanities, all at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln originally
provided the raw digitized data file for the Baltimore and Ohio RR
1857 payroll, from which a large number of railroad job titles were
drawn for inclusion in the new coding system. Jennifer Mahalidge
and Tiffany Rogers coded the mine payroll records from which a
number of mining titles were derived.
