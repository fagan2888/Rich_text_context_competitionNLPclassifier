Bridging the Gap in Academic
Achievement
Education in America is the means to achieving success in
life. The research indicates, however, that African Americans
begin schooling at a tremendous disadvantage. If education
and success are synonymous, the lack of an education is tan-
tamount to a lifetime of frustration. According to Jencks and
Phillips (1998),
African Americans score lower than European Americans on
vocabulary, reading, and math tests, as well as on tests that claim
to measure scholastic aptitude and intelligence. The gap appears
before children enter kindergarten and it persists into adulthood.
It has narrowed since 1970; however, the typical American
Black still scores below 75 percent of American Whites. There
is a lot of overlap between the two groups. Nonetheless, the test
score gap is large enough to have significant social and economic
consequences. (p. 24)
Johnson (2002) further interjected that despite a multitude
of school reform efforts directed at closing the gap in
achievement, we begin the 21st century with the same prob-
lem. These gaps are in evidence with large percentages of
low-income African American, Latino, and Native American
students when compared with their middle- and high-income
Caucasian and Asian counterparts.
The purpose of this phenomenological study was to
describe the implications of the gap in academic achieve-
ment for young urban adults. The achievement gap will gen-
erally be defined as the discrepancy in academic achievement
among different groups of students. The gaps appear by
income, race, and ethnicity.
This review of the literature was designed to determine
the research currently available to address this discrepancy,
and future research needed to gain a total perspective of the
economic, social, and political issues involved in this educa-
tional conundrum. This research study has been conducted to
answer the following research question, "How has the gap in
academic achievement impacted the lives of young urban
adults?"
A considerable body of knowledge suggests that the pur-
pose of education is to provide each student with the oppor-
tunity to excel. The forum for that success will be both in the
classroom and in life. Schools are expected to provide an
appropriate education to all students, which in turn will serve
as a social catapult to upward mobility and the cultivation of

A Phenomenological Case Study of the
Experiences of African American High
School Students
Edna Theresa West1
Abstract
In a progression of scholarly research on the achievement gap, the results remain the same. The data show that there
is a statistically significant difference in the achievement of African American and Hispanic students compared with their
Caucasian and Asian academic counterparts. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to describe the implications of
the gap in achievement for young urban adults. The participants were five African American students who had dropped out
of traditional school. These students described their academic decline through interviews and focus group sessions at two
alternative educational sites. The data were collected and the results indicated that the students felt disconnected from their
teachers and the process of education. As a result of this disconnection, they became adrift in the educational system and
were eventually swallowed by the undertow.

young adults who will make a positive contribution to our
democratic society. Because educational attainment is posi-
tively correlated with life achievement, schools play a sig-
nificant role in the lives of children.
Empirically, too, there is substantial scholarly evidence
that the challenges of providing equal access to all students
are of sizable measure in public education. According to
Hunter and Bartee (2003), "Public schools face critical chal-
lenges when defining equitable access and equality of oppor-
tunity for racial minorities in today's standardized system of
education" (p. 151). These standardized assessments link
access and opportunity to contrived outcomes aligned with
those in power. Placing blame in a wagon and leaving it at
the urban schoolhouse door is a single-sided view of educa-
tional reform. Using standardized tests as battering rams will
not bridge the gap in academic achievement because the root
system goes far deeper than these simplistic, topical solu-
tions. According to Hunter and Bartee, "Closing the perfor-
mance gap between the racial minorities and the racial
majority in schools requires more systemic and institutional
approaches that cannot be achieved through standardized
testing" (p. 157).
Boykin and Noguera (2011) asserted, "What has become
increasingly clear is that doing more of what hasn't worked
over the last eight years is unlikely to produce a different set
of results." They continued, "Requiring public reports of test
score results by race has exposed the lack of focus on educa-
tional equity, even though the law does nothing to help
school districts address the problem" (p. 140). The need to
provide effective educators is underscored by Ladson-
Billings (2009).
Moreover, Lipman (2004) stated, "To me it just seems
obvious that guiding kids in the process of becoming lifelong
critical thinkers, learners, readers, leaders, and participants
for change is not related and cannot be `measured' on a stan-
dardized test bereft of context" (p. 1). Burbridge (1991) has
identified in her study that socioeconomic status, more than
any other variable, determines educational outcomes. V. E.
Lee and Burkam (2002) further corroborated the importance
of socioeconomic status, as did Payne (2005). Bainbridge
and Lasley (2002) indicated, "Far more relevant than race or
gender as academic predictors are the education levels of stu-
dents' parents (as well as other adults) and family socioeco-
nomic status" (p. 424).
Uhlenberg and Brown (2002) further explored the causes
of the gap in academic achievement. Extending a multifac-
eted theory that takes into consideration the child, parenting
and the home environment, the teacher, and the schools helps
us to see that addressing this issue will require a multifaceted
approach. This research aligns with the theory offered by
Lareau (2003). In her qualitative study of 12 families, she
looked at several variables that contribute to the gap in aca-
demic achievement. Through in-depth observations and
interviews conducted with a purposeful sample that com-
prised members of upper-middle-class, working-class, and
poor families, Lareau determined that social class is the most
powerful influence in the lives of children. This theme influ-
ences the organization of daily life, the use of language, and
the interaction between families and institutions. These
themes governed activities such as participation in outside
activities, requesting a specific teacher, and selecting a cer-
tain school, and knowledge of professionals in a capacity to
provide assistance and services. Utilizing the social domi-
nance theory, Van Laar and Sidanius (2001) reiterated the
research of the powerlessness inherent in low social status.
This powerlessness, in turn, leads to the low academic per-
formance of the disenfranchised.
Furthermore, in a study conducted by Ladson-Billings
(2001), the important role of the teacher in closing the gap in
student performance is reiterated. High expectations on the
part of the teacher, aligned with a positive relationship, will
provide the academic foundation necessary for educational
success. Talbert-Johnson (2004) identified the structural
inequalities in urban schools. The redeeming factor will be
providing professional development that will increase the
pedagogical skills of the teachers on staff. Ferguson (2003)
has studied the achievement gap extensively. The Tripod
Project is his effort to eliminate this gap through a rigorous
curriculum, rich in academic content and high standards for
mastery, provided by teachers who have developed positive
relationships with their students, utilizing an effective,
research-based instructional pedagogy. Unfortunately,
Uhlenberg and Brown (2002) have identified low expecta-
tions on the part of classroom teachers as a continuing prob-
lem in their research. Furthermore, their study determined
that Black students seem to be more sensitive to their teach-
ers' perceptions than their White counterparts.
Notwithstanding, Carter (2005) provided research that
offers a different perspective on the manner in which culture
is used to explain the engagement of urban minority students.
According to Carter, culture is a critical feature in the lives of
urban children. The full spectrum of cultural interactions
spans the range of social and political responses to school-
ing. Rather than marginalizing and minimizing the import of
culture in the psyche of urban minority students, we should
choose instead to understand it in relationship to socializa-
tion processes in our educational institutions. We must
respect our children for who they are and give credence to
the journey they have traveled to secure their identity.
However, to move them to the next level, we must set high
standards for academic achievement and high levels of
expectation for content mastery. Fryer and Torelli (2005)
focused on the important impact of culture in closing the gap
in academic achievement. Thernstrom and Thernstrom
(2003) have written a book titled No Excuses: Closing the
Racial Gap in Learning, in which they state,
Excellent schools deliver a clear message to their students: No
Excuses. No excuses for failing to do your homework, failing to
work hard in general; no excuses for fighting with other students,
West 3
running in the hallways, dressing inappropriately, and so forth.
Americans need to say to their schools as well: No Excuses.
Given the challenges urban students face, more money well
spent could improve education. But it does not cost more to set
high academic and behavioral standards, and inadequate funding
and overcrowded classes do not explain the racial gap. Neither
does racial isolation. Family poverty is no excuse for failing to
teach kids. (p. 272)
Accordingly, the research on the gap in academic achieve-
ment is replete with causes and possible solutions. There is,
however, a paucity of research on the student casualties of
this educational and sociological disconnection. The discon-
nection begins with the inability to gain meaningful employ-
ment and ends with economic and social disenfranchisement.
This qualitative study depicted, in detail, the educational
experiences of five students who fell through the gap in
achievement. These are the students described by Thernstrom
and Thernstrom (2003) as being "left behind." The research
added human qualities to the data and sought to personalize
the dramatic impact of this experience.
Given this abundance of information about the gap in
achievement, most of us would expect what V. E. Lee and
Burkam (2002) elucidated, "A key goal of education is to
make sure that every student has a chance to excel, both in
school and in life" (p. 1). Schooling is the dominant factor in
the future success of adults. The impact of education rever-
berates into the areas of college admissions, professions pur-
sued, and salaries paid. Closing the gap in academic
achievement, as stated by the authors, more than any other
single strategy under consideration, would serve to promote
racial equality in the United States.
Method
This was a phenomenological study, which utilized a critical
qualitative approach. My goal was to research the effects of
the gap in achievement on the lives of young urban students
utilizing the social and political aspects of the educational
system, which served to shape their reality of American
schooling. My application was first submitted to the Human
Subjects Review Board at Ashland University for approval.
Upon the approval of my application, the study was con-
ducted with the use of two gatekeepers who served to
identify students who had dropped out of traditional urban
public schools. The program administrators at each campus
approached five students who agreed to participate in this
study. The project was thoroughly detailed in a meeting with
each student. Each participant was then subjected to an inten-
sive review of the goals of this study and the requirements
for the collection of data. The participant consent form was
introduced, read orally, and discussed. Each student signed
and dated the form once all questions were answered. The
youngest member of this study was required to obtain signed
parental permission in order to participate.
Data were collected in the form of one 90-min interview
of three of the five study participants; two 90-min focus
group sessions; two unobtrusive observations, one at each
campus; and a review of artifacts in the form of report cards,
attendance data, and documents pertinent to the students'
matriculation through and eventual graduation from the
alternative high schools. The time line for data collection and
corroboration of results was 8 weeks.
Participants
Five African American students between the ages of 16 and
22, who had previously dropped out of school, served as my
purposeful sample. Two students were male and three were
female. Please refer to Table 1 for a delineation of the study
participants. This population was selected because they all
were pursuing their high school diplomas at an alternative
educational facility. Each student in this study was raised in
an urban area in a large metropolitan city. Each had attended
public schools and had failed at least one grade level.
According to the Ohio Department of Education (2003)
extremely large numbers of children from low-income com-
munities are leaving school unprepared for the demands of
the workplace or postsecondary education. These students
are representative of populations from our African American
and Hispanic communities, along with our children with
disabilities.
Data Collection Methods
The data collected for this phenomenological study were
guided by the following research questions:
Research Question 1: In what ways are the aftereffects of
the gap in academic achievement magnified in the
lives of young urban adults?

Research Question 2: What experiences have these stu-
dents undergone as a result of this phenomenon?
Research Question 3: What meanings have these individ-
uals ascribed to these experiences?
Research Question 4: What are the structural themes that
facilitate a description of these experiences?
To utilize qualitative research to respond to the aforemen-
tioned questions, data were collected in the form of 90-min
tape-recorded interviews and focus group sessions, two
unobtrusive observations, along with report cards and atten-
dance records for each of the five participants. Triangulation
of the data was conducted through detailed journaling of the
entire data collection process, member checks, and clarifica-
tion of researcher bias, along with rich, thick descriptions.
This was a phenomenological study that utilized intensive
open-ended interviews and follow-up interviews for data
collection. Initial interview sessions were structured to get to
know the participants and to establish trust. Each member of
the study signed a participant consent form detailing the
goals and data collection requirements of the study. One par-
ticipant, below the age of 18, also required parental consent.
Questions for the subsequent interviews and focus group
meetings expanded the perceptions and experiences of for-
mal schooling of the initial study participants of Jane, Mark,
and Karl. The study participants were selected through the
use of two gatekeepers, the two administrators at the alterna-
tive education facilities at which the interviewing occurred.
In addition, two focus group sessions were conducted. Two
observations, one at each campus, were completed.
Interviews.The interviews were of 90 min in duration and
were conducted in an office on the site of each educational
facility. The open-ended questions were as follows:
Tell me about yourself. What are your interests and hobbies?
Please share your childhood memories. Tell me about your
experiences in elementary school. What do you remember about
your middle school years? How about your experiences in high
school? What did those experiences mean for you? Who was a
part of your support system? Which teachers do you remember?
If you were to put all of your school memories in order, which
do you feel made the greatest difference in your life? Do you
think others feel as you do?
Focus Groups. The focus group interviews were coordinated
following an analysis of the data from the initial interview
sessions. A new consent form was generated, as the need to
expand the source of data became apparent. This new per-
mission form thoroughly described the study for the benefit
of the participants. This was necessary because the study was
described in detail to the first focus group participants. This
amount of detail was not provided for the second focus group
participants. In the first focus group session with the initial
study participants, extensive information was provided about
the goals and purposes of the study. The consent form was
reviewed thoroughly before they were asked to sign it. They
were queried for concerns; however, when formulated in a
focus group, they indicated that they were in different labs.
We spent time at the beginning of the session with introduc-
tions and a brief overview of the expectations for this ses-
sion. Their questions were generated from previous interview
responses and were as follows:
Describe the connection you felt to school. Did you find school
boring? Why? Did your peers feel the same way? Did you feel
your academic challenges were related to real-world events?
Did you feel your teachers had high expectations for your
learning? Were you prepared by your earlier schooling when
you entered high school? Did you get help when you needed it?
Did repeating a grade keep you from continuing in school? Did
you cut classes and refuse to go to school before actually
dropping out? Was there an adult who tried to get you to go to
class? Do you feel you had too much freedom and not enough
rules? Did your parents know that you were about to drop out of
school? Do you feel that not having a diploma makes it hard to
find a good job? What is different for you now?
The second focus group session was held with the same
orientation to structure, introduction to the process, and
refined questions. The two students in the second session
knew each other well and were in the same lab.
Observations.Unobtrusive observations were conducted at
each alternative educational facility. The first was conducted
in early spring. This center is located in Urban Area 1. I
arrived in the classroom of Karl at 1:20 p.m. Upon entry, I
introduced myself to the teacher and instructional aide. They
knew about my anticipated arrival. I asked for a place in the
classroom where I would not disturb the structure of the ses-
sion. I was offered a seat at the teacher's desk. As I looked
around the room, prior to the beginning of class, I detected
the Center's mission statement posted above the doorway for
each student to read upon entry and departure. According to
the guidelines provided, the Center seeks to impart to all stu-
dents the knowledge, desire, and confidence needed to suc-
ceed with academic and workplace goals. The Center strives
to teach, guide, and support all students through their educa-
tional growth and development.
As each student arrived, he or she signed in on a clipboard
that was located on the instructor's desk. Seventeen students
poured into the classroom in a single file line. They retrieved
work packets from a file cabinet and embarked on their per-
sonalized assignments at their designated computer worksta-
tions. Karl, the youngest study participant, looked over and
smiled at me in recognition as he passed by my observation
location at his teacher's desk. I smiled in return. All comput-
ers in the lab were in service, with the exception of one. This
incapacitated machine was turned so that the screen faced the
back wall. All students in attendance wore muted colors,
with an emblem bearing the Center's logo printed in a vivid
contrast over their hearts. The students ranged in age from 16
West 5
to 22. Students settled down to their assigned coursework
and began completing the tasks that would help them to earn
the credit necessary for graduation. The teacher and the
assistant, a male and a female, circulated among the students
to assess progress. The instructors would sit very close to
each student in each interaction. This continued throughout
my visit. As students completed mandatory assignments,
they turned them in to the instructional assistant and began
another. Karl kept his jacket on as he worked through his
sequence of activities. All assignments were located in two
stuffed file cabinets in the front of the classroom. The stu-
dents were focused on their individual goals and remained on
task. On the faces of some, I could read contentment. Others
had unreadable countenances. Karl was one whose emotions
were not readily visible.
The posters in the classroom reflected the following
themes: "What would you try if you heard that you would not
fail?" "If you don't have time to do it right, you must have
time to do it over." "Those who stand for nothing will fall for
anything." I drew a diagram of the classroom, and quietly
thanked the teachers for allowing me to observe their class. I
departed at 2:30 p.m.
The second site was a center located in an urban area sev-
eral miles away from the first center. I arrived at this center
on a crisp, sunny morning in April. The center's mission was
to provide an education tailored to the needs of each student.
The receptionist greeted me as I approached her enclosed
area and notified the administrator of my presence. I waited
in the reception area with two women who were interviewing
for jobs at this center. I watched as they waited in nervous
anticipation. One had selected to review her notes; the other
was nibbling away at her fingernails. A parent arrived to
withdraw her son who refused to attend school. She shifted
from foot to foot in apparent agitation at her son's educa-
tional apathy. This parent struggled with a baby carrier upon
her arrival. I wondered if the child was her grandson or
granddaughter. So many guardians of adult children and
grandparents are finding their child-rearing responsibilities
to be perpetual. I watched as students arrived to class.
Attendees dressed in jeans, sweatshirts, short skirts, tennis
shoes, and flip-flops arrived and departed as I observed and
scripted notes. The students enrolled in this program attend
class 4 hr each day, 5 days a week. Instruction is highly dis-
ciplined, utilizing the support of a teacher facilitator and an
instructional assistant in each laboratory setting. Once the
students graduate, they receive a state-recognized high
school diploma, not a General Equivalency Diploma. This
1-hr observation session was structured by the following
questions:
What are the places where social activity occurs? Who are the
people involved in the social action? What are the individual
activities in which people are engaged? What are the group
activities in which people are engaged? What are the objects
people use? What is the sequence of activity? What things are
people trying to accomplish? What emotions are expressed?
The computer labs were operated on a staggered daily
schedule that would accommodate 500 students. As students
arrived and departed with no interruption of the educational
process, and an even flow of the academic procedures, it
appeared as if this center had established a very organized
program structure. This occurred throughout my unobtrusive
observation period. The students came and left in a predeter-
mined manner. The social activity occurred in the front park-
ing lot, as students either drove to their places of employment
or to other destinations of their determination. All students
were enrolled in a computer curriculum, which will allow
them to earn the Carnegie Units required for graduation. That
goal is kept alive with the oversized diploma prominently
displayed in the office of the school's administrator. The stu-
dents are assigned to time slots based on their employment
schedules. Jobs are secured, coordinated, and assigned by
career guidance counselors. For the vast majority of the stu-
dents, this is the first meaningful employment in which they
have participated. The students were actively engaged in
exuberant conversation as they arrived and departed. I con-
cluded my observation at 11:30 a.m.
Document Review
Areview of documents and products brings to light the following
themes: Attendance patterns became sporadic as students
became detached from formal schooling. Students attended
several different schools in their academic careers. Students
began to fail prior to actually dropping out of school. The
participants had repeated at least one grade level in their school
careers.
Jane began her sixth grade year at an urban campus, which
accommodated students in Grades 6 through 8. She received
a letter grade of D in language arts, a C in social studies, a D
in math, a B in physical education, a C in science, and a C in
a course titled Star 6. By the third quarter of this academic
year, there were no grades posted. Jane's radical decline
began in the fourth quarter in which she failed most of her
major subjects. She began her seventh grade year with fail-
ing grades in every major subject, with the exception of
mathematics. Karl's academic records indicate that he never
attended a traditional high school. Instead, his father selected
to enroll him in an alternative learning facility at the conclu-
sion of his eighth grade year, at the age of 16. Mark earned
credits in mathematics, social studies, and two electives.
Annette's transcript shows that she has been in attendance
for 1 year at the alternative educational facility and earned
one credit. She has neither taken any portions of the Ninth
Grade Proficiency Test nor the Tenth Grade Graduation Test.
Barbara began attending the center 2 years ago, and dropped
out the following year. She has returned this school year to

complete the process. She, too, will need to complete the
state-mandated testing.
Data Analysis Procedures
The typological data analysis strategy (Hatch, 2002) was uti-
lized to organize the data in this study and to make judg-
ments about the meaning of the data. The data were analyzed
by identifying the topologies present. The initial interviews
led to a set of focus group studies. This expanded process
allowed important themes and categories to emerge. The fol-
lowing topologies from the initial set of interviews and archi-
val research were present in the data sets of each study
participant:
1. The participants were a part of a nomadic home cul-
ture that required them to move among several
schools in the same district, and in some cases, among
different school districts. This created a disconnected
and discombobulated educational foundation permit-
ting students to be lost in the system and experience
early academic failure.
2. The study participants were required to grow through
their formative years with only one parent or legal
guardian, causing feelings of abandonment and loss.
This would point to the need for establishing this
emotional connection in the formal setting of school.
3. All participants verbalized the need to have instruc-
tors who took a personal interest in them. The sub-
themes apparent in the focus group sessions were that
the study participants did not feel a connection in
school. In addition, the teachers did not have high
expectations for their students' learning; therefore,
their instruction was not challenging and related to
their real-world experiences. The final subtheme was
the regret verbally expressed by each participant for
not having earned his or her diploma in the traditional
school format.
Research has shown that a relationship exists between
school system effectiveness, the socioeconomic status of
families in the community, and the education level of parents
(Bainbridge & Lasley, 2002). In the research of Ferguson
(2003), the importance of an enriched curriculum taught by
teachers exceptionally trained in the pedagogy of their field
and committed to providing an outstanding education to their
young urban students is reiterated. Ladson-Billings (2001)
asserted that successful teachers focus on students'academic
achievement, develop students' cultural competence, and
foster a sense of sociopolitical consciousness. Payne (2005)
described the physical, emotional, and physical resources
necessary for these students to succeed. Critical in this pro-
cess is an educational system that is accepting of all students
and an instructional environment that maintains high expec-
tations for achievement throughout the academic process.
The patterns, relationships, and themes within the typologies
are aligned with the research on the achievement gap.
Bainbridge and Lasley (2002) asserted that closing the gap in
achievement requires that educators recognize the inherent
social complexity associated with the educational process. It
is critical that we understand the road traveled by each stu-
dent present in the classroom, appreciate the process, and
build on prior knowledge. Competent, caring educators hold
the key, as corroborated in the research and in this study.
Results
The data were consistent throughout the collection process.
The participants uniformly agreed on specific aspects of their
schooling. Their academic records provided documentation
of the following themes and subthemes:
Theme 1
Mark verbalized the first theme of a disconnected educa-
tional structure in the following transcript:
I moved around a lot. I went to M., E.C., G., L., and also another
school I can't remember. I been to like five elementary schools.
We moved to different schools each year. We lived in E., E.C.
Can't remember none of the rest. . . I failed sixth grade the first
time because I didn't know nothing. I was always skippin' and
stuff, but then after I failed, I started going to school every day
and stuff and started doing my work. And then, toward the end
of my eighth grade year, that's when I started getting in trouble
in the streets and stuff like that. All the teachers in the school
knew me as being bad, and like I was with the wrong crowd and
stuff.
Karl described his experiences as follows:
I went to E. B. D., C., S., W., a lot of schools. We used to travel
everywhere. Can't remember the names of some of the schools.
We used to move all of the time.
Jane stated,
It is probably where I belonged (gifted classes). But I was so
used to being in regular classes. Cause I was going to so many
alternative schools, skipping around from school to school, I
never really noticed that work was too easy or the work was not
hard enough. I do the work, make noise. Make straight A's, one
F. I make an F, and probably tell `em I don't like the teachers and
don't go to class.
Annette remembered,
I bounced around from school to school, to school until I just
stopped. I went to like three elementary schools, seven middle
schools, and two high schools until I just stopped.
In the words of Barbara,
West 7
I went to several schools. I've been to like five elementary
schools, every middle school in this city, and about five high
schools.
The documents for each candidate were peppered with the
names of various schools in two large urban metropolitan
areas used in this study. The same school names were repli-
cated at a later date on their high school transcripts, which
indicated that the study participants withdrew and reenrolled
at the same school within a matter of a year or two.
The subtheme was a lack of connection to school and the
educational process, and thereby finding school to be boring
with no connection to their futures. In the focus group ses-
sions, each participant was asked to describe the connections
he or she felt in school. The responses were sometimes cho-
ral in agreement as they stated,
I didn't feel no connections in school. No connections! I went to
school because I didn't want to be like my sister. The family be
down on me and my sister. Others responded, I hated going to
school! I went to school because my mother made me . . . certain
things were boring and others were not. I like science and math
with hands-on stuff. I like hands-on stuff, too. I did not know
how much I needed school until I got older. I didn't think I
needed to go. Everybody was telling me that I needed to, but it
wasn't clicking in.
The study participants willingly shared that they felt no
connections to school. They went to school because they
were forced to do so by a parent or legal guardian. Comments
such as "I hated school!" were uttered in the tape-
recorded focus group sessions. They all shared regret for not
having completed their schooling; however, their lack of
connection--a firm grasp on the educational system--
allowed them to slip into the abyss of the huge gap in achieve-
ment and become statistics. Uhlenberg and Brown (2002)
stated that Black students seem to be more sensitive to their
teachers' perceptions than their White counterparts. One of
the persistent topics in the achievement gap literature is high
expectation for educational attainment. Teachers must
believe that their children can master complex instruction
taught in a pedagogy that is appropriate. Each of the study
participants moved among schools in a rudderless fashion. It
is very difficult for students to master the expectations of so
many different teachers in elementary school. If special
learning needs existed, it was difficult to detect them and
provide the necessary remediation accordingly. V. E. Lee and
Burkam (2002) posited that social inequalities increase as
students advance through school because of the differentia-
tion in educational experiences that begin as early as the first
grade. The participants in this study began their race at a
decided disadvantage and never gained their educational
footing to advance in alignment with their nondisadvantaged
peers, students who remain in one school district their entire
academic career and students whose parents advocate for
educational placement services for their children as
necessary. Van Laar and Sidanius (2001) observed that
socially powerful parents possess a great deal of cultural and
social competence, along with capital that will prove benefi-
cial to the academic achievement of their children. These
parents can more easily navigate their way through public
and private bureaucracies and pull the necessary strings
within these institutions. The participants in this study did
not have the benefit of this level of advocacy in their process
of schooling.
Theme 2
The second theme of abandonment and loss was expressed in
the words of Jane.
I really didn't have a childhood. My childhood was skipped, my
father was in jail till I was 18. Went in when I was 2 and got out
when I was 18. My mother was off doing God knows what, so I
lived with my grandmother and my little sister. I really didn't
have a childhood. I had to grow up faster than I wanted to. My
toys went to my sister; I had to clean up after my little sister. I
had to do a lot of stuff after her. I didn't have no childhood. I am
just now getting a childhood at 20.
Jane is soon to become a mother. She is both emotionally
and physically removed from the father of her child. In Jane's
interview, she described the loss of her grandmother, who
was her primary caretaker throughout her formative years.
She shared her lucid memories of the demise of her third-
grade teacher from cancer, the same cause of death as that of
her grandmother. She lost an uncle to a heart attack at an
early age, and another uncle was tragically removed from her
life as he was swept away in the violence of the streets. This
was in addition to the loss of her mother and father.
Karl shared his childhood memories in the following
fashion:
I don't remember nothing. I don't know why. Playing with my
uncle and them. We used to be fighting and stuff. He taught me
football and karate. I remember getting my hand cut and going
to the hospital. My father left his job to take me to the hospital.
I was trying to open a can of milk when I was 9 or 10. I been
livin' with my dad for a year or two. We made the change
because we was getting on my mother's nerves. We was good
kids, though. I played football in the projects with my brother--
everybody looked up to us because we was so good. We played
outside my house and on other peoples'streets. We bet money to
see who would win.
Karl talked about the time he spent in the custody of his
mother. He turned 17 years of age during the year of the
study, and to date has only earned one Carnegie Unit toward
his high school graduation. Karl left middle school and was
immediately enrolled into the alternative learning facility. He
never attended a traditional high school. The oldest male par-
ticipant in this study, Mark, shared the following:
8 SAGE Open
I am the oldest in my house now. My older sister and her baby
were hit by a car last year in April. She was 1 year older than me.
There's mostly boys and four girls in my family. The youngest is
2. Everybody stays with my mother. I don't know where my
father is. He left when I was little . . . I can only remember him
in pictures. I look like him. . . .I was in jail most of my teen years
from like 15 to 17. My friends was in jail too. My older brother
gave up on school . . . he started getting in trouble in the eighth
grade.
Mark spoke in a quiet monotone as he shared the atrocity
of losing his sister and nephew to a drunk driver a year ago.
He has been involved in the juvenile justice system, the over-
worked social system that has been unable to provide for the
academic and social needs of children like Mark. He lost 2
years of his life to incarceration. At the tender age of 18, he
has experienced so much; however, his current sense of
direction is refreshing. Completing school to earn his high
school diploma is very important to Mark. In conjunction
with this, Talbert-Johnson (2004) concluded that,
African American males, compared to White males, regardless
of socioeconomic level, are much more likely to be suspended at
a younger age, to receive lengthier suspensions, to be placed in
special education classes, to be programmed into punishment
facilities such as juvenile court rather than into treatment, and to
be given more pathological labels than warranted . . . Punitive
techniques are ineffective, counterproductive and overzealous,
especially for situations involving African American males.
(p. 26)
In the second focus group setting at the alternative educa-
tional facility in Urban Area 2, Annette shared her thoughts
in the following manner:
When I was going to school, it wasn't like it is now. Like now if
you don't do your work, you don't show up, the teachers call
home the same day you weren't in class. But, back then it was
just basically like if you come to school, or come to class you
just come. If you don't come, the teachers don't care. They ain't
gonna send you no homework. You get suspended 10 days. They
don't care. I had really just stopped going.
Barbara, from the same center, added the following:
I really didn't feel no connection. I was about tired of school. I
was going to F [name of a high school] and the teachers up there
did not care. And I was tired of it, it was like I would be there
doing the work and like I was pregnant and some days I couldn't
come. Me and my mother were going through some things,
where she wouldn't excuse my absences. And I had seven
unexcused absences and you on noncredit status. And I'm like
what's the point of me coming.
The subtheme of the need for emotional connections to
fill the void, resound in the achievement gap literature. This
can occur with smaller class sizes, as suggested by Jencks
and Phillips (1998), who posited that having smaller
classrooms and competent teachers with high expectations
will serve to close the gap in academic achievement. These
teachers would be able to connect to their students to create
the emotional bridge necessary to provide academic instruc-
tion to pupils who have experienced this level of loss.
Talbert-Johnson (2004) described the feelings of alienation
reported by African American youth within the school com-
munity. This research indicates that these students fail to see
school as rewarding. Because American schooling is a mid-
dle-class concept, which identifies the academic process as
the means to the end, the members of the middle class will be
required to form the bridge to those who are alienated to per-
petuate this perspective. A lack of identification, according
to this author, is shaped by negative teacher expectations.
Theme 3
Each participant adamantly expressed the need to have quali-
fied, committed, competent instructors who took a personal
interest in him or her. Jane shared,
Teachers told me that I wouldn't amount to nothin'. They say I
don't even know why you come to class. Whether you learn or
not, I'm gonna get paid anyway . . . I was like in the sixth grade
. . . I had to go back to [an urban middle school] and the principal
tell my grandmother, "I don't like her, I don't know why you
sent her here, I don't know why she come here, stay out of my
way or she's gonna be suspended.
Mark concurs with the following:
They told me, you know, they told me I was smart, you know
how they be saying that you intelligent. You should be coming
to school and stuff like that and some of `em told me the same
thing that they told them, too. They say they gonna get paid
anyway . . . I started cutting' classes and hangin' out.
According to Karl, the youngest participant,
Teachers wasn't fun if they didn't have hands-on, or stuff like
that. A couple taught that way, but not everyone. If they didn't
explain it, it was hard for everybody to get it . . . I wasn't
achieving. I don't remember the name of the teacher, but I
remember his face. He used to like use the blocks to explain it
and keep going over it so we could know.
Talbert-Johnson (2004) reported that a well-qualified
teacher can be the single most powerful variable affecting
student performance in schools. Uhlenberg and Brown
(2002) stated that teachers represent the front line in edu-
cation. Ladson-Billings (2001) identified the critical com-
ponents of academic achievement for all students as
follows:
·
· The teacher presumes that all students are capable of
being educated
West 9
·
· The teacher clearly delineates what achievement
means in the context of his or her classroom
·
· The teacher knows the content, the learner, and how to
teach content to the learner
·
· The teacher supports a critical consciousness toward
the curriculum
·
· The teacher encourages academic achievement as a
complex conception not amenable to a single, static
measurement. (p. 74)
Bainbridge and Lasley (2002) offered the argument that
closing the achievement gap means that educators must
recognize the inherent social complexity associated with
the educational process. We must accept our students as
they come to us, build on their prior knowledge and levels
of experience, and expect high levels of performance.
Teachers are our front line of defense as they spend the
greatest amount of time with our children in classroom
settings.
The limitations of this study begin with the sample size.
There are only five participants who were interviewed for
this study, and their perceptions cannot be generalized to a
much larger group of adults who have experienced the after-
effects of the gap in academic achievement. However, their
views provide us with direction for future research. In addi-
tion, the youngest participant, Karl never attended a tradi-
tional high school. He technically never officially dropped
out of school. Karl continued to attend traditional schools,
despite the fact that he was 16 years of age and never entered
high school. His father enrolled him in this alternative learn-
ing facility. Another source of concern from a research valid-
ity perspective was that the male members of this study were
less loquacious and far less verbose than their female coun-
terparts. It was necessary to conduct several member checks
to make sure the data I had transcribed were their perception,
and not my opinion of their tape-recorded sessions, which
were heavy-laden with pregnant pauses. There were also
concerns regarding the duration of the study. The minimum
time in the field obtaining, collating, and triangulating data
for a study of this magnitude would be 12 months. This
would have permitted observations in alternative settings for
each of the study participants. Finally, the entire sample
comprised students who have selected to return to school to
earn their high school diplomas. This study could not be uti-
lized for those who have not selected to complete the process
or those who have instead chosen to obtain their General
Equivalency Diploma.
Please refer to Table 2 for a summary of the themes and
subthemes developed in this section.
Discussion
The goal of this study was to provide a window into the lives
of the students who have fallen victim to the gap in aca-
demic achievement. This study was designed to give a voice
to and personalize the data. The responses to the research
questions that gave direction and focus to this study pro-
vided an intensely personal perspective of this educational
conundrum.
Each participant in this study expressed the importance of
obtaining a traditional high school diploma, and regret for
having not completed his or her education originally. The
aftereffects have involved incarceration at one extreme and
an inability to locate gainful, meaningful employment at the
other. Each of the female participants either is or will become
a mother. Perhaps the early involvement of social services in
a proactive capacity in conjunction with our urban educa-
tional institutions would help these young mothers to be able
to provide for their children economically, educationally, and
emotionally. Each young mother expressed a desire for
something better for her child or children. In each case, the
road to the alternative learning facility was long and punctu-
ated with challenges. Each expressed a desire to attend
college.
Table 2. Themes and Subthemes: Bridging the Gap in Academic Achievement.
 I. Lack of academic stability
 Students moved among several different schools during their formative years of education
 Students lacked the adult support system necessary to guide them through the pitfalls of the educational process
 Students failed one or more grades in school
 Students dropped out of school
II. Feelings of abandonment and loss
 Students grew up without one or more of their biological parents
 Students experienced loss of significant others in their lives and/or a part of their lives in the juvenile justice system
 Students did not feel a connection to formal schooling
 Students expressed grief over dropping out of school
III. The need to form bonds with their teachers
 Students felt no connection to the academic process
 Students felt no connection to most of their teachers
 Students felt that their teachers did not have high expectations for their learning
 Students felt that their instruction was not challenging and related to the experiences of their lives
10 SAGE Open
The most dramatic experience these students have shared
is a lack of preparation for their desired avocation. They feel
they have been left behind by and disconnected from the tra-
ditional educational process. The first comment made regard-
ing their current schooling is the size of the classes and the
caring of their instructors. The research aligns with this per-
ception. In the unobtrusive observations conducted at each
facility, the close proximity of the teachers to the students
was demonstrative of the connection each participant sought.
The educators appeared to be committed to making sure that
the students in their charge mastered the personalized, indi-
vidualized instruction developed for them.
The meanings the students have unanimously ascribed to
their educational experiences were that their teachers did not
care about them or about their learning process. The instruc-
tors and role models they remembered were those who con-
nected their instruction with creative activities and had high
expectations for them. The teachers were culturally compe-
tent. Carter (2005) has determined that the requisite knowl-
edge base in American society needs to be expanded and
culturally inclusive. All teacher education programs must be
imbued with this culturally relevant knowledge base in the-
ory and in practice. As Ladson-Billings (2001) so elegantly
stated, we can and must educate all children. This can occur
when teachers have high expectations for learning, and
understand that all children are capable of learning. These
teachers must know the content, the learner, and how to teach
that content to the learner, as well as support the develop-
ment of critical consciousness and cultural competence.
When high academic standards are maintained, achievement
is the by-product of all instruction.
And, finally, the themes expressed were those of a lack of
academic stability, feelings of disconnection, and the need to
establish positive relationships with their teachers. This per-
fectly aligns with the research of Ferguson (2003), in which
the quality of the instructor, in conjunction with the high
level of expectation, and the provision of an enriched cur-
riculum utilizing effective pedagogy are required for closing
the gap in academic achievement. This must occur in the
classroom of a caring, conscientious professional who not
only understands his or her children but is also willing to
establish a positive rapport with each one. The attitude must
be that expressed by Thernstrom and Thernstrom (2003).
They reiterate the importance of accepting no excuses for
failing to instruct all children. In the words of Gates (2006),
Once we realize that we are keeping low-income and minority
kids out of rigorous courses, there can be only two arguments for
keeping it that way--either we think they can't learn, or we
think they're not worth teaching. The first argument is factually
wrong; the second is morally wrong. (B. Gates, personal
communication, March 30, 2006)
The current research indicates that teachers and adminis-
trators must move beyond blaming children and their parents
for low achievement. This was evident in a survey adminis-
tered by Boykin and Noguera (2011). According to the sur-
veys and interviews that were conducted with educators, it
was reported that the quality of their work was fine and that
it was up to parents to do something to improve student
achievement outcomes. The authors continue by reviewing
schools successful in making a difference for all children.
They conclude that ultimately, the only way to close the
achievement gap is by paying careful attention to creating
learning conditions in which academic success is more likely.
Providing enriched learning opportunities after school will
extend learning time in ways that are most likely to make a
difference.According to Rod Paige, the former U.S. Secretary
of Education, we must first understand the ramifications of
the Black­White achievement gap, then we must accept
responsibility for closing this gap, and we must develop a
sense of urgency about accomplishing this critical academic
challenge.
Giving a voice to the students who have personally expe-
rienced the results of the gap in academic achievement helps
us to understand the importance of bridging this crevasse.
Because a key goal of education is to assure the success of all
students, we can no longer continue to ignore a large portion
of our students. We owe our commitment to Jane, Karl,
Mark, Annette, and Barbara. We owe our determination to
their offspring.
We owe our perseverance to all children. According to V.
E. Lee and Burkam (2002), closing the gap in achievement,
more than any other single strategy under consideration,
would serve to promote racial equality in the United States.
The results of this phenomenological study provided a per-
sonalized perspective of the research that will lead to the
attainment of this most noble goal.
