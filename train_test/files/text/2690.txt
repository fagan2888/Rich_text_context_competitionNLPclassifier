Abstract
Objectives:This study examines the potential use of interviewer-rated health (IRH) as a complementary measure of self-
rated health (SRH) through a systematic comparison of their components and mortality-predictive powers in the Chinese
elderly population.
Methods: This study used a nationwide dataset with more than 12,000 adults aged 65 or older drawn from the 2005 and
2008 waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey (CLHLS).
Results:Disability, cognitive function, chronic disease conditions, psychological well-being, and health behaviors
influenced both the SRH and IRH of Chinese older adults; these factors, especially disabilities, explained a large
portion of the association between SRH and mortality. However, the impact of these factors on the association
between IRH and mortality was limited. Furthermore, when both SRH and IRH were included in the analytical
models, the association between SRH and mortality disappeared, while the association between IRH and mortality
still persisted.
Discussion:Although there is some difference between IRH and SRH, IRH captures similar health information as SRH
and is strongly predictive of mortality independent of SRH; thus, IRH could be a good supplementary measurement for
well-adopted SRH.
Key Words: China--Interviewer-rated health--Mortality--Older adults--Self-rated health
Numerous studies have shown that self-rated health (SRH)
is a good measurement of health, and it is strongly asso-
ciated with subsequent health outcomes such as mortal-
ity (Borawski, Kinney, & Kahana, 1996; DeSalvo, Bloser,
Reynolds, He, & Muntner, 2006; Huisman & Deeg, 2010;
Idler & Benyamini, 1997). In the existing literature, a sin-
gle item asking respondents to rate their global health is
the generally adopted measure of SRH; this persists even
though there have been attempts to use multiple-item scales
of SRH (Bjorner and Kristensen, 1999) or comparative
SRH--an evaluation of an individual's own health relative
to that of age peers or to one's past health (Vuorisalmi,
Lintonen, & Jylhä, 2005). SRH has thus been proposed as
a cost-effective and reliable substitute for objective health
indicators and a valuable complement to routine medical
diagnosis and screening (Federal Interagency Forum on
Aging-Related Statistics, 2003). A large number of studies
have already been conducted on this simple but effective
measurement; yet, researchers continue to demand more
research to better understand what affects the self-rating
539
process of SRH, what health aspects it captures, what
makes up its mortality-predictive power, and how it varies
across populations and social/cultural contexts (Benyamini,
2008, 2011; Smith and Goldman, 2011).
SRH is essentially a subjective measurement that involves
complex perceptions over multiple health or health-related
domains (Benyamini, Idler, Leventhal, & Leventhal, 2000;
Goldman, Glei, & Chang, 2004; Kaplan & Baron-Epel,
2003). Studies consistently show that the self-assessment
of overall health may take into account not only physical
health conditions (e.g., illnesses, diseases, or functioning)
but also other factors such as cognitive capacity, psycho-
logical well-being, clinical risk factors, health behaviors,
health experience and history, health services utilization,
medication use, and social participation (Benyamini et al.,
2000; Goldman et al., 2004; Kaplan & Baron-Epel, 2003;
Mäntyselkä, Turunen, Ahonen, & Kumpusalo, 2003;
Mavaddat et al., 2011; Singh-Manoux et al., 2006; van
Doorn, 1999). As a subjective evaluation, SRH is affected
by a set of cognitive factors (Huisman & Deeg, 2010; Jylhä,
2009). First, because the criteria used to judge global health
(i.e., self-criterion) vary considerably across individuals,
this often leads to different ratings (DeSalvo & Muntner,
2011; Idler, Hudson, & Leventhal, 1999). Choices about
whom to use as a reference--namely, self-referencing (e.g.,
age peers, ideal image or role models, or individual's own
past health)--also affect the outcome of SRH (van Doorn,
1999). Cultures, especially culture-based health values and
beliefs, play an important role in personal health percep-
tions as well (McMullen & Luborsky, 2006). Jylhä (2009)
has recently proposed a conceptual model to reflect such a
subjective process: individuals first prioritize biomedical or
functional conditions and risk factors that form self-per-
ception; next, they compare their personal health to that
of their chosen referent; finally, they take cultural/social
norms into consideration and express their assessment.
As SRH may introduce certain biases due to its subjec-
tivity, researchers have also embarked on efforts to examine
external evaluations of global health that can be completed
by raters such as medical professionals, spouses/family
members, or survey interviewers (Todd & Goldman, 2013).
Relative to SRH, these external evaluations might be more
costly due to the intensive communication and observation
required; however they may provide valuable complemen-
tary information for SRH that could help increase the accu-
racy of measurements of overall health and better predict
subsequent health outcomes (Ayalon & Covinsky, 2009;
DeSalvo & Muntner, 2011; Giltay, Vollaard, & Kromhout,
2012; Markides et al., 1993; Smith & Goldman, 2011;
Todd & Goldman, 2013).
Existing literature on external ratings of health focuses
mostly on evaluations by medical personnel (e.g., DeSalvo
& Muntner, 2011; Kriegsman et al., 1996; Markides
et al., 1993). Studies have shown that physicians' ratings
are valid predictors of patients' mortality, independent of
SRH (Giltay et al., 2012). A medical professional's rating
could be more advantageous over SRH, as the former fol-
lows a scientific evidence-based procedure that integrates
objective clinical data gathered via a diagnosis of diseases,
a review of medical history, an evaluation of symptoms,
a physical examination, and an assessment of risk factors
(Giltay et al., 2012). However, health ratings made by non-
professional persons such as spouses/family members, or
survey interviewers have been studied infrequently, and the
association between these ratings and respondents' mortal-
ity has not been well established. Several studies reported
that the health reports made by spouses could predict part-
ners' mortality--independent of SRH and other objective
health measures (Daugherty, 2009; Peek et al., 2006; van
Doorn, 1998)--and that the combined use of spouse-rated
health reports and SRH led to better mortality prediction
than the use of SRH alone (Ayalon & Covinsky, 2009).
A more recent study further corroborated that compared
to the subject's own rating, proxy-rating may evaluate the
global health condition of the subject differently and pre-
dict subsequent mortality differently (Vuorisalmi, Sarkeala,
Hervonen, & Jylhä, 2012).
The health ratings of survey interviewers, that is, inter-
viewer-rated health (IRH), have recently gained increasing
attention. Chen and Wu (2008) found that the SRH­mor-
tality association among the Chinese oldest-old was sub-
stantially attenuated by the inclusion of IRH. Based on
a survey of older adults in Taiwan, Smith and Goldman
(2011) found that, in contrast to SRH, IRH gives more
weight to certain health aspects such as physical function-
ing, and they proposed that IRH could be a complemen-
tary measure to SRH. More recently, Todd & Goldman
(2013) examined the predictive powers of SRH, IRH, and
physician-rated health for mortality over a 5-year period
for a cohort of Taiwanese elderly. They concluded that IRH
performed the best and thus advocated increased use of
IRH at the end of social surveys to complement routinely
adopted SRH.
As compared to SRH, IRH could have the following
advantages (Brissette, Leventhal & Leventhal, 2003): inter-
viewers may develop a good understanding of the global
health of a respondent based on onsite observations and
communications; interviewers can capture valuable health
information such as physical appearance and environmen-
tal characteristics, which are outside of the range of objec-
tive medical tests; interviewer evaluations are not affected
by the self-serving biases of respondents; and based on their
observations of multiple respondents, interviewers often
adopt a referent scheme that is clearer and more stable
than the vague and subjective ones used by respondents.
More importantly, IRH often incorporates the information
of SRH, as IRH is usually done after the interview and the
interviewers already know the SRH of their respondents
(Todd & Goldman, 2013).
This study examines the potential use of IRH as a com-
plementary measure of SRH through a systematic compari-
son of their components and mortality-predictive power

in the Chinese elderly population. More specifically, we
aim to examine: (a) components of SRH and IRH for the
elderly Chinese, (b) the predictive power of SRH and IRH
with respect to 3-year all-cause mortality, and (c) the extent
to which each component of SRH and IRH influences the
SRH­mortality and IRH­mortality associations.
We proposed a conceptual framework to guide the
following empirical analyses (see Supplementary Figure
A). The possible components of SRH include multidi-
mensional health conditions (e.g., biomedical conditions,
psychological, and social well-being), which are based on
major findings in previous research (e.g., Idler, Hudson, &
Leventhal, 1999; Østbye et al., 2006; van Doorn, 1999).
A set of biopsychosocial factors from biological, psycho-
logical, behavioral, and social domains was also included
in the conceptual framework. Research has shown that
various demographic and socioeconomic factors in dif-
ferent populations are associated with SRH (Chandola,
Ferrie, Sacker, & Marmot, 2007; Han, Kim, & Lee,
2012; Kunst et al. 2005; Schütte, Chastang, Parent-
Thirion, Vermeylen, & Niedhammer, 2013; Yamaoka,
2008). Education, for example, has proved to be associ-
ated with SRH in many countries, regardless of the level
of economic development (Furnée, Groot, & van den
Brick, 2008; Hanibuchi, Nakaya, & Murata, 2012; Nishi
et al., 2012; Subramanian, Huijts, & Avendano, 2010).
Psychosocial and behavioral factors have also proved to
be highly associated with SRH (Mackenbach et al., 2002;
Malinauskiene et al., 2011; Manderbacka, Lundberge,
& Martikainen, 1999; Sargent-Cox, Anstey, & Luszcz,
2010). Recent research has further revealed that SRH is
strongly associated with major biomarkers and certain
genetic components (Jylhä, Volpato & Guralnik, 2006;
Svedberg, Lichtenstein, & Pedersen, 2001; Zeng, Hughes,
Lewis, Li, & Zhang, 2011). In addition, there is grow-
ing evidence that, independent of other possible influ-
ences, health conditions during childhood could exert
long-term effects on SRH in adulthood (French, Sargent-
Cox, & Luszcz, 2012; Wen & Gu, 2011). The environ-
mental characteristics of the respondent's daily life,
macro socioeconomic conditions, and cultural values also
affect health self-rating (French et al., 2012; Han et al.,
2012; McMullen & Luborsky, 2006; Sacker, Worts, &
McDonough, 2011; Subramanian, Kubzansky, Berkman,
Fay, & Kawachi, 2006).
In the lower section of Supplementary Figure A, we
incorporated external ratings of global health as provided
by IRH. Similar to SRH that is affected by the personal
and contextual characteristics of respondents, we proposed
that IRH is influenced by characteristics of both respond-
ents and interviewers and the respondent's multidimen-
sional health conditions. Additionally, to reflect the fact
that IRH often incorporates information of SRH as it is
usually asked at the end of the survey interviews, we added
an arrow to link the SRH and IRH in the figure.
Data and Methods
Study Population
The data came from the 2005 and 2008 waves of the
Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS),
which were conducted in a randomly selected half of the
counties/cities in 22 Han-ethnicity-dominant provinces
in China (851 counties/cities in 2005). The CLHLS is an
ongoing project with the goal of interviewing all centenar-
ians in the sampled counties/cities as well as a compara-
ble number of randomly selected males and females with
approximately equal sample size at each age from 65 to
99. The data were collected through in-home interviews
by trained interviewers who are local staff members from
the county-level network system of the National Bureau of
Statistics of China. All interviewers have received 12+ years
of schooling, and most have earned a college degree. Each
interviewer was accompanied by a local doctor, a nurse, or
a medical college student so that some health check-ups
could be performed. The sampling procedure and quality of
data have been detailed elsewhere (Zeng et al., 2008) and
descriptive documents are accessible via the CLHLS web-
site (http://centerforaging.duke.edu/chinese-longitudinal-
healthy-longevity-survey). Duke University Health System's
Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved ethics
for this survey, and informed consent was obtained from
each respondent.
Due to the availability of data on the major variables
of interest, the 2005 wave and the 2008 follow-up wave
were used in this study. The 2005 cross-sectional sample
consisted of 15,638 individuals aged 65 and older. Of these
initial respondents from the 2005 cross-sectional sample,
7,472 (47.8%) survived to the 2008 survey, while 5,111
(32.7%) died before the 2008 survey, and 3,055 (19.5%)
were lost to follow-up. These 12,583 cases (7,472 plus
5,111), who were not lost to follow-up in the year of 2008
and thus had mortality information, make up the 2005­
2008 longitudinal sample. The response rate for each wave
of the survey was around 90%. Respondents lost to fol-
low-up were excluded from the analyses because we were
unable to determine their survival status in the 2008 survey.
A sensitivity analysis of inclusion of those lost to follow-up
with imputed survival information from multiple imputa-
tions with covariates produced similar results.
SRH and IRH
In the baseline survey of 2005, respondents were asked
to rate their overall health as "very good," "good," "fair,"
"poor," or "very poor." For this study, we combined the
"poor" and "very poor" categories due to small frequen-
cies. An additional category, "unable to answer" was des-
ignated for respondents who were too sick to answer the
question (about 8%). We compared three approaches to
dealing with this category: (a) dropping cases in this cat-
egory from the analysis, (b) coding them as "poor/very
Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 3
541
poor," and (c) imputing values for these cases based on the
responses of the respondents with the same demographic
and socioeconomic characteristics, health resources, and
disabilities. Because the results of the three methods were
similar, we used imputed estimates for this category in the
final analyses. In the 2005 wave, survey interviewers were
asked to rate the overall health of the respondent after
the completion of each interview (i.e., IRH). Interviewers
could categorize respondents as "healthy,""fairly healthy,"
"slightly ill," or "moderately or severely ill."These four cat-
egories correspond to the four categories used to measure
SRH.
Components of SRH and IRH
In the conceptual framework outlined above, the following
health-related conditions were considered as components
of SRH and IRH: Physical health, cognition, psychologi-
cal well-being, and social participation. Physical health
was measured by disability, disease condition, and ill-
ness. Disability includes disability both in activities of
daily living (ADL) (Katz et al., 1963) and in instrumental
activities of daily living (IADL) (Lawton & Brody, 1969).
ADL disability was defined as a self-reported need for
assistance in performing any of the following six tasks:
bathing, dressing, eating, indoor transferring, toileting,
and continence. Each item was assigned a value of 0 if
no assistance was needed and 1 otherwise. The final ADL
disability score ranges from 0 to 6. IADL disability refers
to a self-reported need for assistance in performing any
of the following eight activities: visiting neighbors/friends,
shopping, cooking, washing clothes, walking 1 km, lifting
5
kg, crouching and standing up three times, and taking
public transportation. The coding of IADL was similar to
that of ADL, and the final score ranges from 0 to 8.
Disease condition was measured in terms of self-reported
number of chronic diseases (out of 25 listed in the question-
naire, including most of the major ones such as cardiovascu-
lar diseases, diabetes, pneumonia, and arthritis) that affect
the respondents. With regard to illnesses, respondents were
asked whether they had felt "not well" in the last 2 weeks
(yes vs. no), and the number of hospitalizations or period
of being bedridden they had experienced in the last 2 years.
"Not feeling well" in the last 2 weeks reflects the respond-
ent's overall subjective or emotional state in a very recent
time period and it could more directly impact how respond-
ents rated their health status at the time of interview.
Cognitive impairment was measured by the Chinese
version of the mini-mental status examination (MMSE)
(Wen & Gu, 2011), which tests seven aspects of cognitive
functioning: Orientation, registration, copy and design,
calculation, recall, naming, and language (repetition, read-
ing and obeying, writing, and commands). We considered
a respondent's cognition as normal if the MMSE score was
24 or higher; otherwise, the respondent was considered
as cognitively impaired (Wen & Gu, 2011). Psychological
well-being was measured by two items: first, does the
respondent often look at the bright side of things (i.e., opti-
mistic) (always/often vs. fair/seldom/never); second, does
the respondent feel as happy as when he/she was young
(always/often vs. fair/seldom/never). Social participation
was defined as active if the respondent reported either
playing Mahjong with others or taking part in any form
of social activities--both on a weekly or more frequent
basis; if not, the respondent was categorized as inactive. To
assess whether study respondents used overall health in the
past year as a reference when rating their current health,
we added a variable that measures self-perceived changes
in global health in the past year (better, unchanged, and
worsened).
Mortality
Mortality risk was the dependent variable in survival
analyses, which was measured by survival status (died or
survived in the 2008 wave) and the duration of survival
(days of survival between the two waves). The dates of
the interviews were recorded for both the 2005 and 2008
waves. For those who died before the 2008 interview, the
dates of death were collected from officially issued death
certificates whenever available; next-of-kin and local resi-
dential committees were consulted when a death certificate
was not available. Our supplementary analysis showed that
the data quality of death rates in the CLHLS from 2005 to
2008 was high based on comparisons between the CLHLS,
censuses taken in 2000 and 2010, and a 1% population
sampling survey taken in 2005.
Control Variables
The analyses controlled for numerous factors that could con-
found the SRH­mortality and IRH­mortality associations
(Burström & Fredlund, 2001; Idler & Benyamini, 1997;
Mackenbach, Simon, Looman, & Joung, 2002); these fac-
tors include demographic characteristics, early-life condi-
tions, socioeconomic status (SES), social connection and
support, health practices, life satisfaction, and family longev-
ity (a proxy for genetic traits). Two contextual factors, the
local per capita GDP and average years of schooling in the
county in which the study respondent was living at the time
of survey (both measured in 2005), were also included in the
model. To account for the substantial geographic variation
in socioeconomic development across China, we included a
regional measure with five categories: North, Northeast, East/
Southeast, Central China, and Northwest. Coding details for
covariates are not presented in the current manuscript due to
space limit, yet are available from the authors upon request.
Statistical Analysis
To achieve the first research goal (i.e., examining the
major components of SRH and IRH), we used the 2005
Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 3
542
cross-sectional sample and multilevel ordered logistic
regressions based on the generalized linear latent and
mixed models (gllamm) (see Skrondal & Rabe-Hesketh,
2004). Two sequential models were designed for both SRH
and IRH (see Table 2). We did not present models with age
and gender as the controls only because the results are very
close to those with additional covariates. To achieve the
second research goal (i.e., assessing the predictive power
of SRH and IRH with respect to 3-year all-cause mortal-
ity), three models were conducted using data from the
2005­2008 longitudinal sample (See Models B-I to B-III
in Table 3); shared-frailty parametric models with random
effects were employed in order to take into account the
correlations between respondents within the same county
(Gutierrez, 2002). In a similar vein as for the first goal, we
did not present models with age and gender as the controls
only. To fulfill the third goal (i.e., investigating the extent
to which these components attenuate the SRH­mortality
and IRH­mortality associations controlling for a number
of covariates), six models were designed using the same
longitudinal sample for the second goal (See Models B-IV
to B-IX in Table 3). In the sequential models for fulfilling
the second and third goals, we designed models including
SRH and IRH separately and simultaneously not only to
compare the predictive power of SRH and IRH, but also
to investigate how the SRH­mortality association changes
when IRH is adjusted for.
With the exceptions of parental age at death, the propor-
tion of missing values for all other variables in the analysis
was less than 2%. To reduce possible bias due to missing
values in the analysis and inferences, we employed the mul-
tiple imputation technique for all variables except parental
age at death, for which we treated missing (around 20%)
as a special category. We did not apply sampling weights in
the regression models because the CLHLS weight variable
was unable to reflect the national population distributions
with respect to variables other than age, sex, and urban/
rural residence. All analyses were performed using STATA
12.0.
Results
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for both the 2005
baseline sample and the 2005­2008 longitudinal sam-
ple (all results were unweighted). As shown in the table,
with respect to elders in the baseline sample, about 10%
described their health as very good, 37% as good, 36%
as fair, and 18% as poor or very poor; for IRH, the corre-
sponding proportion of health ratings were 27% (healthy),
56% (fairly healthy), 15% (slightly ill), and 2% (moder-
ately or severely ill). The distributions suggest that respond-
ents were more likely to report their health status as very
good or good, while interviewers seemed to favor the fairly
healthy category. The distributions of the major variables in
the longitudinal sample were mostly similar to those in the
cross-sectional sample.
Table 2 presents how the components were correlated
with poorer SRH and IRH. The overall patterns with
regards to the components for SRH and IRH were simi-
lar, showing that the components of SRH could also be
applied to IRH. However, by looking into the 95% confi-
dence intervals of odds ratios (not shown), we find some
difference in associates for SRH and IRH. For instance,
IADL disability, ADL disabilities, and cognitive impair-
ment all had a stronger association with poorer IRH than
with poorer SRH. In Model A-II for SRH, the 95% con-
fidence intervals of the odds ratios were 1.14­1.18 for
IADL, 1.15­1.21 for ADL, and 1.04­1.23 for cognitive
impairment, respectively; correspondingly, Model A-II
for IRH had 1.26­1.31 for IADL, 1.29­1.37 for ADL,
and 1.43­1.71 for cognitive impairment, respectively.
Moreover, self-perceived change in overall health in the
past year had a stronger influence on poorer SRH than
on poorer IRH (95% confidence intervals: 3.95­5.03
for SRH vs. 1.65­2.14 for IRH from Model A-II). These
results imply that study respondents placed more emphasis
on their own perceptions and past experience when rating
health, whereas interviewers emphasized more externally
detectable measures.
Among the individual-level biopsychosocial fac-
tors, in the adjusted models, older age was associated
with lower odds of both respondents and interviewers
reporting poorer health. For IRH, minority ethnic status
(relative to Han status) was also related to lower odds
of poorer health. There were significant geographic dif-
ferences in both SRH and IRH, with a larger variation
found for IRH. Higher SES in adulthood or old age was
associated with lower odds of poorer SRH and IRH.
Higher levels of family/social support or connections
were positively associated with better SRH, but were
not associated with IRH. Current smokers, alcohol con-
sumers, and those doing regular exercise had better SRH
and IRH. Good life satisfaction was associated with bet-
ter SRH and IRH. Among the community level biopsy-
chosocial factors, higher per capita GDP was associated
with lower odds of poorer SRH and IRH. The average
educational level of residents in a community was posi-
tively associated with poor IRH, but had no association
with SRH.
Supplementary Figure B presents the proportion of
death between the two waves in terms of ratings of SRH
and IRH. Clearly, the mortality gradient across IRH
ratings is more pronounced than that across SRH rat-
ings. The relative hazards of 3-year mortality for differ-
ent ratings of SRH and IRH are summarized in Table 3.
Compared to the ratings for very good SRH, the ratings
for good SRH, fair SRH, and poor/very poor SRH were
associated with 14%, 36% and 88% increase in mortal-
ity risk, respectively, controlling for a number of covari-
ates (Model B-I). The IRH­mortality association was
also significant. Compared to the healthy rating of IRH,
the relative hazards of ratings of fairly healthy, slightly

The remaining models in Table 3 demonstrate the extent
to which the SRH and IRH components influence the SRH­
mortality and IRH­mortality associations when all associ-
ates were controlled for. Model B-IV shows that, when the
physical health components were added to Model B-I, the
association between SRH and mortality diminished. The
SRH­mortality association became insignificant when IRH
was further included (Model B-VI). For the IRH­mortal-
ity association, it diminished as well once physical health
components were added in the model (Model B-V). But in
the presence of SRH in addition to physical health compo-
nents, the IRH­mortality association had almost no change
(Model B-VI). When components of cognitive function,
psychological well-being, social participation, and change
in global health in the past year were additionally included
in the analyses, the SRH­mortality and IRH­mortality
associations continue to further diminish. Nevertheless,
all poorer ratings of IRH continue to be significantly asso-
ciated with a higher risk of mortality compared with the
healthy rating.
Discussion
Several recent efforts have attempted to introduce external
health ratings such as IRH to complement SRH (Smith &
Goldman, 2011; Todd & Goldman, 2013). Using data from
the 2005 and 2008 waves of the CLHLS, we compared the
SRH and IRH for Chinese older adults by examining their
components, their predictive power with respect to mor-
tality, and the role of each component in influencing their
associations with mortality. The main insight of this study
is that although some difference exists between IRH and
SRH, IRH captures similar health information as SRH and
is strongly predictive of mortality independent of SRH;
thus, IRH could be a valuable supplementary measurement
for SRH.
Our results show that ADL and IADL disability, chronic
diseases, recent illnesses and hospitalizations, cognitive
function, psychosocial well-being, and social participation
were all important components for both SRH and IRH in
Chinese older adults. However, when the structure of these
components were compared with respect to SRH and IRH,
the respondents tended to place more emphasis on personal
health experiences and perceptions (e.g., self-perception of
changes in health in the past year); by contrast, the inter-
viewers relied more on externally detectable health condi-
tions such as ADL and IADL disabilities. These findings
are consistent with studies on Western populations (e.g.,
Benyamini, Leventhal, & Leventhal, 1999; Brissette et al.,
2003; Østbye et al., 2006).
The finding that the robust power of IRH in predicting
mortality in the presence of SRH and a variety of covariates
among Chinese elders echoes some previous studies that
advocated IRH as an excellent complement to SRH (Smith
& Goldman, 2011; Todd & Goldman, 2013). Reviewing
how CLHLS interviewers evaluated respondents' health
may help explain the advantage of IRH to predict mortal-
ity. In the CLHLS, IRH was completed immediately after
an interviewer finished collecting data from the respond-
ent. That is, the interviewer health evaluation was based
on rich information about the respondents. In particular,
the information of SRH was also incorporated into the
rating process of IRH. Moreover, because interviewers
usually investigated multiple respondents, they were able
to develop a relatively objective standard for rating the
respondents in comparison to peers. Consequently, the
personal subjective biases of interviewers may have been
avoided to some extent. Furthermore, onsite observations
and communications may have allowed interviewers to
capture unmeasured health information in their ratings.
For example, observing whether or not a bathing facil-
ity was available could help an interviewer understand
whether self-reported ADL difficulties in bathing were
intrinsic or due to environmental barriers (Purser, Feng,
Yi, & Hoenig, 2012). The higher educational attainment
of the interviewers than the respondents could also matter.
Only 38.9% of our respondents had received 1+ years of
schooling; by contrast, most interviewers had received 12+
years of schooling, and their better health literacy may have
allowed them to provide more accurate assessments of the
global health of the respondents.
Our findings on the value of IRH among Chinese older
adults have broad implications for individuals, family, and
public health practitioners. From the perspectives of both
individuals and families, our study suggests that the health
ratings by a nonprofessional rater could still provide added
value to health assessment in addition to the well-known
SRH. Our study recommends the adoption of external
health ratings such as IRH in social surveys and fieldwork.
Doing so may help refine overall health measurements and
improve their accuracy and predictive powers on subse-
quent health outcome such as mortality. In practice, we
consider it feasible to add a question regarding IRH at the
end of survey questionnaires. Such an additional question
may not incur too much cost, but could provide a way to
refine health measurements including SRH (also see Todd
& Goldman, 2013). If possible, we also suggest that sur-
veys include a few more questions that would capture per-
sonal information about the interviewer as a rater of IRH
(e.g., demographic characteristics, education, occupations,
health literacy, and information related to the subjective
process of rating of study respondents). This information
could facilitate future studies to better understand how
characteristics of interviewers might affect their health
assessment of respondents.
It needs to be noted that we are not proposing to take
IRH as an alternative or replacement to SRH. First, SRH
should be still preferred as an easier and more cost-effective
health measure than IRH, as the latter usually involves face-
to-face interviews. Second, as shown in our findings, unlike
SRH, IRH is more likely to be based on detectable condi-
tions of physical health, but unable to capture somatic and

emotional states as effective as SRH. More importantly,
although the predictive power of IRH for mortality is inde-
pendent of SRH, the rating of IRH is somewhat associated
with SRH because IRH was performed after interviewers
acquired the information on SRH. Users of IRH should
treat this issue with particular caution, and future stud-
ies are encouraged to investigate the performance of IRH
when measured without any information regarding SRH.
This study also has some other interesting findings. We
found that, among Chinese older adults, a higher mortal-
ity risk of fair or poorer SRH relative to very good SRH
was primarily explained by ADL and IADL disabilities.
Why was the SRH­mortality association more sensitive to
ADL and IADL disabilities than the other components in
this population? ADL and IADL disabilities are indeed the
strongest mortality predictors among the Chinese elderly
population (Feng, Hoenig, Gu, Yi, & Purser, 2010). Because
the measurements of ADL and IADL disabilities are directly
based on respondents' daily experiences, they may be less
affected by response errors than health measures that
require more knowledge or more accurate memories such
as self-reports of chronic diseases, psychological well-being,
or hospitalization history. This could be particularly true in
China, where certain health indicators such as chronic dis-
eases may not be reported accurately by respondents who
have low educational attainment, few chances to undergo
medical examinations, and little access to advanced medi-
cal diagnostics techniques. Results about associative fac-
tors of SRH and IRH are also noteworthy. Current smokers
and alcohol drinkers are found to be associated with better
SRH in China, which is inconsistent with previous litera-
ture (Manderbacka et al., 1999). We speculate that poorer
SRH among smoking quitters and the exclusion of fre-
quency or amount of smoking/drinking in analyses may be
partially responsible. Furthermore, smoking and drinking
in East Asian cultures is indicative of the maintenance of
a social network, which, in turn, promotes psychological
well-being in late life (Gu, Feng, & Sautter, 2008). We have
also observed significant geographic differences in both
SRH and IRH, especially the latter. Unobserved regional
heterogeneity in culture, socioeconomic development and
access to medical resources may contribute to differences
among respondents with respect to health awareness, lit-
eracy, and judgments in evaluating global health. Besides
these factors, interviewers' characteristics that are unavail-
able for us to explore in this study may also contribute to
the geographic variation in IRH. We call for future research
to shed more light on these issues.
This study has some limitations. First, like SRH, IRH
is also subjectively determined by personal evaluations of
interviewers. Therefore, the characteristics of interviewers
and the criteria they have used in health evaluations may
have affected the outcome of IRH. As our current data did
not contain such information, we were unable to explore
this issue. Second, our empirical findings to support IRH
as a useful complement of SRH are based on a study of
the Chinese elderly population; these findings may not be
directly generalized to Western societies as cultural and
socioeconomic contexts often affect health perceptions and
reporting (Hanibuchi et al., 2012; McMullen & Luborsky,
2006; Nishi et al., 2012; Schütte et al., 2013). However, we
think, it is very likely that IRH performs similarly across
cultures. As we have discussed, most of the advantages of
IRH over SRH--such as the incorporation of rich health
information and the relatively objective evaluation frame-
work based on multiple respondents--may still apply in
other societies regardless of the cultural and socioeconomic
background. Lastly, the Chinese wording of the four cat-
egories for SRH--namely "very good," "good," "fair,"
or "poor/very poor"--are not semantically the same as
the categories used for IRH--namely "healthy," "fairly
healthy," "slightly ill," or "moderately or severely ill." We
have translated these terms word-for-word based on their
original meanings in Chinese. Although such semantic vari-
ance between the two sets of response items may introduce
some bias, it should not alter our primary findings, as they
are still comparable schemes in the Chinese context. We
call for future studies to examine this issue by using exactly
identical response items for these two measurements.
