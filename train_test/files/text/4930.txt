ABSTRACT
Since the identification of the gene responsible for HD
(Huntington's disease), many genetic mouse models have
been generated. Each employs a unique approach for
delivery of the mutated gene and has a different CAG repeat
length and background strain. The resultant diversity in the
genetic context and phenotypes of these models has led
to extensive debate regarding the relevance of each model to
the human disorder. Here, we compare and contrast the
striatal synaptic phenotypes of two models of HD, namely
the YAC128 mouse, which carries the full-length huntingtin
gene on a yeast artificial chromosome, and the CAG140 KI
(knock-in) mouse, which carries a human/mouse chimaeric
gene that is expressed in the context of the mouse genome,
with our previously published data obtained from the R6/2
mouse, which is transgenic for exon 1 mutant huntingtin.
We show that striatal MSNs (medium-sized spiny neurons)
in YAC128 and CAG140 KI mice have similar electrophys-
iological phenotypes to that of the R6/2 mouse. These
include a progressive increase in membrane input resistance,
a reduction in membrane capacitance, a lower frequency of
spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and a greater
frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents
in a subpopulation of striatal neurons. Thus, despite
differences in the context of the inserted gene between
these three models of HD, the primary electrophysiol-
ogical changes observed in striatal MSNs are consistent.
The outcomes suggest that the changes are due to the
expression of mutant huntingtin and such alterations can be
extended to the human condition.

INTRODUCTION
Since the identification of the huntingtin gene (The
Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993),
many genetic models of HD (Huntington's disease) have been
generated, ranging from transfected cells to invertebrates,
rodents and, most recently, primates. The most studied of
these are the mouse models of HD, which have been shown to
replicate facets of the disorder (Bates et al., 2002; Hickey and
Chesselet, 2003; Levine et al., 2004). Mouse models have
employed a number of different approaches for delivery of
the mutant gene and a range of promoters to drive
expression at various levels. In addition, experimenters have
used either truncated or full-length DNA. The differences in
genetic context and resultant phenotypes of these models
have led to extensive debate regarding the consistency of
outcomes and relevance to the human disorder. Often
different research groups have chosen a preferred model in
which to conduct experiments, and findings from different
models are not systematically contrasted. In a comparative
study, we recently reported that similar electrophysiological
synaptic phenotypes were identifiable in cortical pyramidal
neurons of three different mouse models of HD (Cummings
et al., 2009). The first was the R6/2, the most widely studied
mouse model of HD (Bates and Hockly, 2003; Woodman et al.,

2007), which expresses a truncated transgene consisting of
exon 1 with ,150 CAG repeats (Mangiarini et al., 1996). The
second, the YAC128 mouse, carries the full-length HD gene
on a yeast artificial chromosome (Slow et al., 2003). The third
model used a gene-targeting or KI (knock-in) approach to
insert a chimaeric mouse/human exon 1 containing 140 CAG
repeats into the murine huntingtin homologue (Hdh) and
thus expresses the mutant HD gene in the normal context of
the mouse genome (Menalled et al., 2003). We concluded
that the basic cortical electrophysiological phenotype is
consistent across these models and is likely to be true for the
human disease.
In the present experiments, we compared electrophysio-
logical alterations in synaptic transmission in striatal MSNs
(medium-sized spiny neurons) in the same three models.
Previously, we described progressive decreases in the
frequency of spontaneous EPSCs (excitatory postsynaptic
currents) and increases in spontaneous IPSCs (inhibitory
postsynaptic currents) in MSNs of both R6/2 and R6/1 mice
(Cepeda et al., 2003, 2004). Here, we examined spontaneous
EPSCs and IPSCs in MSNs in the YAC128 and CAG140 KI
mice. We demonstrate that the progressive decrease in
excitation and increase in inhibition also occur in these
mouse models and therefore likely represent a striatal
synaptic dysfunction in human HD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Mice were obtained from our colonies at the UCLA (University
of California Los Angeles). All procedures were performed in
accordance with the USPHS Guide for Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at UCLA. Transgenic mice
containing the full-length human HD gene with 128 CAG
repeats on a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC128, line 53)
(Slow et al., 2003), maintained on an FVB/N background, were
examined at 1, 6 and 12 months of age. KI mice had a
chimaeric mouse/human exon 1 containing 140 CAG repeats
inserted into the murine huntingtin gene (Menalled et al.,
2003), maintained on a mixed 129/SVXC57BL/6 background,
were examined at 6, 12 and 18 months of age. These
ages were based on previous studies defining behavioural
phenotypic milestones in each of the lines (Slow et al.,
2003; Hickey et al., 2008). Appropriate age-matched WT
(wild-type) littermates were used as controls. Mice were
genotyped at least twice, once at weaning and again after
experimentation, to verify genotype. For all experiments, mice
of both genders were used as there were no consistent
differences between measures obtained from males and
females.
Slice preparation
Mice were anaesthetized using halothane and then decapi-
tated, and the brain rapidly removed to ice-cold dissection
ACSF (artificial cerebrospinal fluid), containing 130 mM NaCl,
3 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3,
1.25 mM NaHPO4
, 10 mM glucose,
5 mM MgCl2
and 1 mM CaCl2
; aerated with 95% O2
/5%
CO2
; pH57.2; 290­300 mOsm/l. The hindbrain was removed
with a razor blade and glued by the caudal axis to the stage
of a vibrating microtome (model VT1000S; Leica), and 350 mm
coronal slices that included the striatum were cut. Slices
were then stored and allowed to recover at room temperature
(25°C) in a submerged chamber in oxygenated standard
ACSF (the same composition as dissection ACSF, except
that MgCl2
and CaCl2
were 2 mM) for at least 1 h prior to
experimentation.
Whole-cell patch­clamp recordings
MSNs were visualized in the dorsolateral striatum using IR
videomicroscopy and differential interference contrast
optics and identified by somatic size and basic membrane
properties. Whole-cell patch­clamp recordings were made
using glass micropipettes (electrode impedance 4­6 MV)
filled with a caesium methanesulfonate-based solution
containing 125 mM caesium methanesulfonate, 4 mM NaCl,
3 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2
, 9 mM EGTA, 8 mM Hepes, 5 mM
MgATP, 1 mM Tris/GTP, 10 mM disodium phosphocreatine
and 0.1 mM leupeptin; pH57.2; 270­280 mOsm/l. During
electrophysiological recordings, slices were continuously
perfused in ACSF at a flow rate of ,2 ml/min at room
temperature.
To record spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs, the membrane
current was filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 100­200 ms
using Clampex 8.2 (gap-free mode) (Molecular Devices). Cells
were voltage-clamped at 270 mV to assess basic membrane
properties and to examine glutamate receptor-mediated
EPSCs. Where indicated, 20 mM BIC (bicuculline methobro-
mide) was applied in order to block GABAA
(c-aminobutyric
acid type A) receptor-mediated currents. To isolate GABAA
receptor-mediated IPSCs, membranes were stepped to a
holding potential of +10 mV and the ionotropic glutamate
receptor antagonists CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-
2,3-dione; 10 mM) and AP5 (DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric
acid; 50 mM) were applied. All drugs were obtained from
Sigma­Aldrich. Stock solutions were prepared in distilled
water (or NaOH for AP5) and then dissolved in ACSF to
required concentrations.
Statistical analyses
Spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs were analysed offline using the
automatic detection protocol within MiniAnalysis program
(Justin Lee; Synaptosoft; 1999) and subsequently checked
manually for accuracy. Event counts were carried out by an
experimenter blind to genotype. The threshold amplitude

IPSCs) was set above the root mean square noise (1­2 pA at
Vhold
5270 mV and 2­4 pA at Vhold
5+10 mV). Event kinetics
were analysed using MiniAnalysis software. Events with
amplitudes between 10 and 50 pA (EPSCs) and 15 and 70 pA
(IPSCs) were aligned by half-rise time and normalized by peak
amplitude. Events displaying complex peaks were excluded
from this analysis. The decays of both EPSCs and IPSCs could be
fitted with second-order exponential curves, and these were
used to determine rise time, decay time and half-amplitude
durations.
Values in the Figures are presented as means¡S.E.M.
Numerical values for the estimated parameters and sample sizes
are indicated within the Figures. Differences between group
means were assessed with appropriate Student's t tests (two-
tailed, unpaired with or without Welch's correction for unequal
variance) or appropriately designed analyses of variance followed
by Bonferroni's post-hoc test. Microsoft Excel and SigmaStat
2.03 (SPSS) were used to perform all statistical analyses.
RESULTS
Basic membrane properties of MSNs
The basic membrane properties of striatal MSNs have been
shown to be progressively altered in slices from R6/2 mice
(Cepeda et al., 2001, 2004; Klapstein et al., 2001). No
differences in input resistance or capacitance in MSNs of R6/
2 mice were seen prior to the onset of the overt motor
phenotype, while MSNs from behaviourally phenotypic mice
showed increased input resistance and decreased capacitance.
We therefore assessed basic membrane properties in the
YAC128 (Table 1) and CAG140 KI (Table 2) mice. At 1 and 6
months, no differences in the input resistance of YAC128
MSNs and their respective WTs were observed. By 12 months,
however, a highly significant (P,0.0001) increase in input
resistance occurred. No significant differences in membrane
capacitance were observed at any age. MSNs from the
CAG140 KI mice showed no change in input resistance at 6
months but by 12 (P,0.01) and 18 (P,0.05) months, MSNs
displayed input resistances that were significantly increased
compared with their respective WTs. KI mice also showed a
decrease in capacitance at 12 (P,0.05) and 18 (P,0.01)
months, but no difference at 6 months.
Spontaneous EPSCs
We next examined spontaneous EPSCs, which have been
shown previously to have a progressive decrease in
frequency in MSNs of R6/2 and R6/1 mice with overt
phenotype progression (Cepeda et al., 2003; Rossi et al.,
2006). Similar effects occurred in both the YAC128 and KI
models (Figure 1). When cell membranes were voltage-
clamped at 270 mV and spontaneous currents recorded in
ACSF (Figure 1A, left), YAC128 MSNs at 1 month showed no
difference in spontaneous EPSC frequency compared with
their WT counterparts. By 6 months, a significant reduction
in frequency occurred in YAC128 MSNs (P50.01 compared
with WT; P,0.01 compared with 1 month YAC128). Further
reductions were seen at 12 months (P,0.001 compared with
WT; P,0.05 compared with 6 months YAC128). Similar
progressive decreases in EPSC frequency were observed
in the CAG140 KI mice (Figure 1A, right). No difference in
frequency was observed in CAG140 KI MSNs at 6 months
compared with WTs. By 12 months a significant reduction
was evident (P50.001 compared with WT; P,0.001
compared with 6 months CAG140). This reduction with
respect to WTs was maintained at 18 months (P,0.01
compared with WT).
Effects of BIC on spontaneous EPSCs
A proportion of the spontaneous currents recorded at 270 mV
in standard ACSF could be mediated by GABAA
receptors
and/or the excitatory drive of presynaptic cortical and
thalamic projection neurons could be suppressed by inhib-
itory inputs from local interneurons. We applied the GABAA
receptor antagonist BIC (20 mM) to eliminate these
influences. Previously, in the R6/2 mice, we observed a
reduction of 10­20% in spontaneous EPSC frequency in both
genotypes (Cepeda et al., 2003). There was no significant
difference in the percentage change seen in WT compared
with R6/2 mice and, moreover, the reduction in frequency
was maintained. In the YAC128 and KI mice, a different
pattern occurred in response to BIC application (Figures 1B
and 1C). In all cells from WTs, there was a decrease in
frequency of EPSCs in BIC. In YAC128 mice, however, some
cells responded with a decrease in frequency, while others
responded with an increase (Figures 1B and 1C, left panels).
At 1 month, only one of eight cells responded with an
increase in frequency after BIC treatment, and the overall
outcome of BIC application was not statistically different

from that of WTs. At 6 months, 36% of cells responded with
an increase in EPSC frequency, but the overall outcome of BIC
application was still a decrease that was not significantly
different from WTs. By 12 months, 75% of cells showed an
increase after BIC application and the overall outcome was a
significant increase in EPSC frequency (P,0.001). Despite the
increase in EPSC frequencies in response to BIC, the decrease
in spontaneous EPSC frequency in YAC128 mice compared
with values in WTs still occurred at 6 and 12 months. At 6
months, the effect was a trend that was not statistically
significant (P50.07), but it was significant at 12 months
(P,0.05).
This differential effect of BIC also occurred in MSNs of
CAG140 KI mice (Figures 1B and 1C, right panels). At 6
months, in both WT and KI MSNs, BIC application resulted in
a reduction in frequency of EPSCs. At 12 months, 53% of
CAG140 KI cells responded with an increase in EPSC
frequency and, similarly to the oldest group in the YAC128
mice, the overall effect of BIC did not reach statistical
significance (P50.06). Because of the ,25% decrease in
frequency seen in WT MSNs and the ,25% increase seen in KI
MSNs, the difference in mean EPSC frequency was not
maintained in the presence of BIC in this group of cells. Due
to the technical difficulties of recording from animals at 18
months of age, the effects of BIC were not tested at this age
in the CAG140 KI mice.
Spontaneous IPSCs
We reported previously that two populations of MSNs were
identifiable in the R6/2 striatum. One population displayed
an LF (low frequency) of IPSCs and was indistinguishable
from WTs. The other population displayed an HF (high
frequency) of IPSCs, which were never seen in WTs (Cepeda
et al., 2004). When IPSCs were isolated at a holding
membrane potential of +10 mV in the presence of the
ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX (10 mM)
and AP5 (50 mM), two populations of MSNs were again
observed in YAC128 and CAG140 MSNs (Figure 2). At all ages
in the YAC128 mice (Figure 2, left), a small population of
MSNs with an HF of IPSCs (P,0.001 compared with WT) was
identified, but only in transgenic mice. Unlike the R6/2, a
progressive difference was also observed in the LF popu-
lation of cells. At 1 month, the mean frequency of LF IPSCs
in YAC128 was identical with WTs. At 6 and 12 months,
however, there was a significant reduction in frequency in
the LF population of cells compared with WTs (P,0.01 at
both 6 and 12 months).
The changes in IPSCs were less pronounced and transitory
in the CAG140 KI mice (Figure 2, right-hand panel). At 6
months, no differences in the frequency of IPSCs, including
no cells with HF IPSCs, were observed. At 12 months, both LF
and HF cells were identified. Similar to the YAC128 mice, the
LF population of cells showed a lower frequency of IPSCs than
WTs (P,0.05). Very few HF cells were observed (3/18 cells),
but these showed a highly significant increase in frequency
compared with WTs (P,0.001). At 18 months, the LF
population of cells maintained a reduction compared with
WTs (P,0.05), but no HF cells were observed in the cells
sampled.
Event kinetics
When the kinetics of averaged spontaneous EPSCs were
analysed in R6/2 MSNs, we observed no differences in rise
time, decay time or half-amplitude duration for any age
(Cepeda et al., 2003). In contrast, Milnerwood and Raymond
(2007) demonstrated faster spontaneous EPSC decay kinetics
in MSNs of YAC128 mice at 1 month. In our hands, at this age
no differences in EPSC kinetics between WT and YAC128
neurons were observed (Figure 3A, left panels). At 6 and 12
months, a faster decay time of EPSCs was observed (P,0.01
and P,0.05 respectively). Rise time and half-amplitude
duration were unaltered at any age. No differences in the
EPSC kinetics of 6 or 12 month CAG140 KI mice were
identified (Figure 3A, right panels). At 18 months of age, cells
from these animals had EPSCs with faster decay times
(P,0.05).
We also examined the kinetics of spontaneous IPSCs. In the
LF and HF populations of R6/2 MSNs, IPSCs were found to have
faster decay times (Cepeda et al., 2004) and this effect was also
observed in the two lines of mice studied here (Figure 3B). At 1
month of age, IPSCs in the LF population of YAC128 cells
(Figure 3B, left panels) had a faster decay time (P,0.05). The
faster decay time in the HF population of cells did not reach
statistical significance. Half-amplitude duration did not show
significant differences at this age. By 6 months, both the LF
(P,0.01) and HF (P,0.05) populations had IPSCs with faster
decay times and shorter half-amplitude durations, an effect
that was maintained at 12 months (P,0.05 to P,0.001). In the
CAG140 KI mice (Figure 3B, right panels), only the HF
population of cells at 12 months showed altered IPSC kinetics.

DISCUSSION
The present experiments demonstrate that both YAC128 and
CAG140 KI mouse models of HD show similar alterations in
basic membrane properties and both spontaneous EPSCs and
IPSCs to those observed previously in the R6/2 and R6/1
models of HD (Cepeda et al., 2003, 2004; Cummings et al.,
2009). The reduction in EPSC frequency has also been
confirmed by others in the R6/2 mouse and the neurotoxic
3-nitropropionic acid rat model of HD (Rossi et al., 2006).
Spontaneous EPSCs were also studied by Milnerwood and
Raymond (2007) in MSNs of the YAC128 mouse at 1 month of
age and, similar to our results, no differences in EPSC
frequency were identified, although there were changes in
EPSC kinetics. Here, we extend the striatal data in YAC128 to
12 months and CAG140 KI mice to 18 months, demonstrating
a reduction in EPSC frequency. Similarly, a reduction in
spontaneous EPSCs has been observed at 6 months in a model
of HD in which full-length human huntingtin is carried on a
bacterial artificial chromosome with 97 mixed CAA-CAG
repeats (Gray et al., 2008). Similar to the present dataset, the
cortical electrophysiological phenotype was demonstrated to
be common to each of the R6/2, YAC128 and CAG140 KI
mouse models of HD (Cummings et al., 2009).
MSNs receive a major excitatory drive from the cortex, in
which pyramidal neurons from almost the whole cortical
mantle, but in particular the motor and somatosensory
cortices, project to the striatum (Bolam et al., 2000).
Therefore the reduction in EPSC frequency probably represents
a disconnection between the cortex and striatum, which is
likely to be mediated by the loss of spines and the presence of
dysmorphic neuronal processes characteristic of both cortical
and striatal neurons in HD (Klapstein et al., 2001).
Thalamostriatal projections also provide an excitatory input
on to MSNs (Ding et al., 2008; Smeal et al., 2008).
Corticostriatal and thalamostriatal terminals appear to be
equal in number in non-disease states (Lacey et al., 2005) and
may synapse on to distinct populations of MSNs (Dube
´ et al.,
1988) and excitatory synapses formed by corticostriatal and
thalamostriatal projections have differential electrophysio-
logical properties (Ding et al., 2008; Smeal et al., 2008).
However, the properties of neurons within the thalamic nuclei
or their influences on striatal neurons have yet to be
determined in HD.
There were commonalities and differences in GABAergic
neurotransmission between the three models of HD. All
showed two populations of cells, one with LF IPSCs and one
with HF IPSCs. No difference was observed between the LF
IPSCs in the R6/2 mouse compared with WTs (Cepeda et al.,
2004). In contrast, in both the YAC128 and CAG140 KI mice
there were reductions in frequency compared with their
respective WTs for this population of cells. Whereas the
change in glutamatergic neurotransmission probably reflects
alterations in corticostriatal (and thalamostriatal) connections,

animals only. One displayed LF IPSCs and the other HF IPSCs. IPSCs were isolated at a holding potential of +10 mV and in the
presence of CNQX and AP5. Results show mean frequencies¡S.E.M. for each age. Statistical significance with respect to WTs is
indicated by **P,0.01 and ***P,0.001.

the alterations in GABAergic currents reflect abnormal
synaptic transmission local to the striatum. MSNs receive a
major inhibitory drive from striatal interneurons (Tepper et al.,
2004, 2008; Plotkin et al., 2005) and it is therefore likely that
dysfunctional, fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons underlie
the changes observed in inhibitory currents in MSNs. Altered
MSN­MSN interactions may also be of importance, as these
neurons receive inputs from other MSNs via both electrical
(gap junction) and chemical (synaptic) connections (Wilson
and Groves, 1980; Venance et al., 2004), although their
importance relative to fast-spiking interneuronal inputs is still
debated (Tunstall et al., 2002; Czubayko and Plenz, 2002).
Furthermore, connectivity between interneurons has been
shown to affect both excitatory and inhibitory inputs to MSNs,
as knockout of the neuronal gap junction gene for connexin 36
leads to reductions in both EPSC and IPSC frequency
(Cummings et al., 2008). An altered connexin 43 expression
pattern has been demonstrated in post-mortem HD brain (Vis
et al., 1998). While the connexin 43 subunit is associated with
the coupling of astrocytes, if changes in the neuronal connexin

36 occur in HD, altered interneuronal synchrony is likely to
result.
The influence of GABAA
receptor-mediated inhibition on
EPSCs was altered differentially in the YAC128 and CAG140
mice, a finding contrary to that in the R6/2 mouse model
(Cepeda et al., 2003). In R6/2 (and WT) mice, application of a
GABAA
receptor antagonist reduced the frequency of events
recorded at a holding potential of 270 mV, suggesting that a
proportion of these events were GABAergic in origin. In
contrast, in MSNs from YAC128, a higher proportion of cells
responded with an increase in frequency upon GABAA
receptor blockade as animals aged. This was also observed
at 12 months in MSNs from CAG140 KIs. Such an effect may
be due to altered inhibition within the striatum, which may be
shunting excitatory inputs received from the cortical and
thalamic terminals. Alternatively, cortical pyramidal cells are
known to be hyperexcitable in the R6/2, YAC128 and CAG140
KI models of HD (Walker et al., 2008; Cummings et al., 2009).
Application of BIC to the corticostriatal slices may thus
exacerbate the hyperexcitability of cortical cells, leading to
increased release of glutamate, reflected in MSNs as increased
EPSC frequency.
The rate of progression of the electrophysiological
phenotypes varied between the different models (Figure 4).
This divergence is likely to be due to a combination of
the precise regulation of the huntingtin gene expressed in the
alternative models and cumulative compensatory mech-
anisms, which may be more prevalent in the slower onset
models. Differences in EPSC frequency were detectable as
early as 40 days in the R6/2 model, while no differences were
detected until 6 months in the YAC128 and only at 1 year in
the CAG140 KI. These effects correspond to previous reports
of phenotypic progression in the YAC128 and KI lines. The
finding that no difference in EPSC frequency was observed at
the youngest ages in any line of HD mouse models suggests
that presymptomatic HD gene carriers are likely to have more
normal excitatory inputs to MSNs. In contrast, IPSC frequency
increased in a population of cells in the youngest age group
of YAC128 mice and a trend towards an increase in IPSC
frequency was evident in R6/2 mice (Cepeda et al., 2004), but
no difference was observed in CAG140 mice. This suggests
that alterations in inhibitory inputs probably from fast-
spiking interneurons within the striatum are affected at a
much earlier stage than the excitatory inputs received by
MSNs from cortical and thalamic projections. Furthermore,
our previous data suggest that a cortical electrophysiological
dysfunction may occur earlier than observed in the striatum
and that the predominant cortical phenotype is an alteration
in GABAergic neurotransmission (Cummings et al., 2009). As
interneurons are relatively spared in HD (Ferrante et al.,
1985), there has yet to be a systematic electrophysiological
examination of striatal interneurons in an HD mouse model
to determine whether and how they are dysfunctional.
The differences that we identified between the models
included altered EPSC kinetics, an altered effect of GABAA
receptor blockade on EPSC frequency, and a reduced
frequency of IPSCs in a subpopulation of cells in YAC128
and CAG140 KI mice that were not observed in R6/2 mice.
These differences may suggest that these alterations require
the full-length mutant huntingtin to occur or may reflect the
presence of the transgene over a protracted period of time
and would therefore not be observed in the R6/2 mouse that
reaches end stage at approx. 3­4 months of age. It is
tempting to speculate, therefore, that the disparate finding
observed in R6/2, YAC128 and CAG140 mice may represent
differences between adult- and juvenile-onset HD.
Notwithstanding these differences, the predominant synaptic
phenotype was consistently observed across models. Recently,
an in vivo study of striatal MSNs showed reduced bursts of HF
activity and a loss of synchrony in both the R6/2 and CAG140
KI mice (Miller et al., 2008). Also, the R6/2 mouse and a KI
mouse carrying 150 CAG repeats showed consistent changes
in molecular phenotypes when background strain and disease
progression were taken into account (Woodman et al., 2007).
Therefore it appears that the precise HD gene construct does
not significantly alter the basic electrophysiological pheno-
types observed in the cortex (Cummings et al., 2009) and
striatum.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that a full-length model
(YAC128) and a targeted model (CAG140 KI) of HD display
similar basic striatal electrophysiological phenotypes to the
R6/2 mouse, namely a decrease in EPSC and an increase in
IPSC frequencies in striatal MSNs. The consistency of these
phenotypes across different mouse models of HD suggests
that these changes are a result of the mutant huntingtin
gene rather than being idiosyncratic to a particular model.
