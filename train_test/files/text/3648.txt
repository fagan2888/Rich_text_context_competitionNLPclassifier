Introduction
The importance of leadership has grown significantly in
organizations as compared with the past. Globalization,
shifting social and demographic trends, enhanced knowl-
edge of workforce, and rapid technological innovations
have created a need among organizational top manage-
ment to utilize all their efforts toward bringing organiza-
tional change (Graetz, 2000). Leadership is identified as
one of the most important factors for this successful trans-
formation (Kotter, 1995). It is considered as a key con-
tributor towards building organizational capacity for
change (Judge, 2011), as organizations aim to enhance
their capacity to change requires effective and trustworthy
leadership (Judge, 2011; Judge & Elenkov, 2005; Soparnot,
2006). These leaders organize and align followers toward
a common goal by giving them direction and defining the
most appropriate behaviors and attitudes needed for
change (Geller, 2003; Northouse, 2007). They develop
trusting followers that ultimately leads to enhanced capac-
ity for organizations to change (Judge, Bowler, & Douglas,
2006).
The available literature provides evidence that the busi-
ness environment is changing rapidly and becoming impul-
sive and volatile. Organizations try to cope with such
environment and initiate change, but at times they fail due to
poor change management and lack of change leadership
practices (Higgs & Rowland, 2000; Judge, 2011). Successful
leaders and organizational change agents are essential to deal
with the unpredictable and hypercompetitive organizational
environment (Judge, 2011). Therefore, new dimensions for
effectively managing changes are continuously explored to
help an organization best handle the process of change.
Organizational change capacity (OCC) is a relatively new
theoretical development for effectively managing change
(Soparnot, 2011). Judge (2011) described OCC as "a dynamic,

Abstract
This article intends to examine the role of leadership styles (transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire) and employees'
trust toward organizational change capacity (OCC). Data were collected from a convenient sample of managers, coordinators,
officers, community facilitators, social organizers, and activists through questionnaires. A total of 250 respondents were sent
questionnaire, usable questionnaires were 204. Results revealed positive and significant relationship between transformational
leadership and employees' trust. Moreover, an insignificant relationship was found between transactional leadership and
employees' trust, whereas laissez-faire and employees' trust were found to be negatively associated. Findings of the study
also depicted a positive and significant relationship of transformational leadership and transactional leadership with OCC.
However, laissez-faire was negatively associated with OCC. Results also revealed that employees' trust mediates the
relationship between leadership styles (transformational and laissez-faire) and OCC. However, employees' trust did not
mediate the relationship between transactional leadership and OCC. Finally, implications and suggestions for future research
are provided.

multidimensional capability that enables an organization to
upgrade or revise existing organizational competencies, while
cultivating new competencies that enable the organization to
survive and prosper" (p. 14). Comprehension of the OCC
construct is still in its refinement stages (Judge, 2011).
Therefore, empirical researchers are required to observe its
efficacy and the impact that various related concepts (i.e.,
leadership and trust) can place on it (Judge, 2011; Soparnot,
2011). Effective navigation of the organization through
change capacity development requires involvement of all the
employees. It requires trust of the employees in leadership
and organization (Geller, 2003; Judge, 2011). Thus, leader-
ship, via building trust of the employees, can surely get them
participating in the change process, thereby contributing to
the change capacity of an organization. Therefore, the change
capacity of an organization, to a great extent, depends upon
the leaders. This is the reason that leadership is extremely
important and crucial for the effective management and
implementation of organizational change (Higgs, 2003; Higgs
& Rowland, 2000).
Pakistan is an important part of Asia-South Pacific, where
philanthropic and voluntary activities have a long history.
These activities are accomplished in the areas of health, civil
rights, social welfare, and education. Such activities emerge
out of national culture with strong influence of Islamic ideol-
ogy. The people of Pakistan trust these organizations more
than the government organizations and donate generously to
them; despite being a developing country, Pakistani society
contributes massively to the non-profit organizations
(Pakistan Center for Philanthropy, 2015). Thus, non-profit
organizations play an important role in Pakistan and to meet
the philanthropic needs of the growing population of
Pakistan, they should continuously improve and upgrade
themselves. Therefore, research is needed to observe the fac-
tors that influence the change process, and for this reason,
this research intends to examine the factors (leadership and
employees' trust) that influence the change capacity of these
organizations.
The current study focuses on finding the effect of leader-
ship styles on OCC through the mediating role of employees'
trust. The study is novel and original for many reasons. First,
few studies in the previous literature depict that there is a
lack of empirical research on the notion of OCC both in the
Western and Asian contexts, and relatively little is known
about its antecedent conditions (Judge, 2011; Judge et al.,
2015; Oxtoby, McGuiness, & Morgan, 2002; Ramezan,
Sanjaghi, & Rahimian Kalateh baly, 2013; Soparnot, 2011).
Second, the literature on the relationship between OCC and
leadership (i.e., transformational leadership, transactional
leadership, and laissez-faire leadership) lacks attention.
Third, the study incorporates employees' trust as a mediator
in the relationship between leadership styles and OCC.
Finally, the study is based on the evidence from non-profit
organizations that have been working in Pakistan for decades
on social, economic, and developmental issues.
Objectives of the current study are to examine the rela-
tionship between leadership styles (transformational, trans-
actional, and laissez-faire) and OCC, to investigate the
relationship between leadership styles and employees' trust,
and to examine employees'trust as a mediator in the relation-
ship between leadership styles and OCC, specifically in the
non-profit organizations working in Pakistan.
Literature Review
Leadership
Organizations exist for different purposes. Such as, commu-
nity-based organizations exist to empower the community,
whereas business-oriented organizations are to generate and
maximize profits. To achieve their objectives, leadership of
these organizations plays an important role. Several leader-
ship models exist; however, the full range leadership model
proposes that the leadership process is a continuum that
starts from the non-effective leadership approach that is lais-
sez-faire leadership and moves toward an involving leader-
ship approach that is transactional leadership and ends at
transformational leadership, a motivating and inspiring lead-
ership style (Avolio & Bass, 2004; Bass & Avolio, 1990a;
Xirasagar, 2008).
Transformational leadership is known for its change ori-
ented leadership style at the organizational, group, and indi-
vidual level of analysis with positive outcomes (Judge &
Piccolo, 2004). Transformational leadership comprises four
components (Avolio & Bass, 1991; Bass & Avolio, 1990b):
idealized influence is the degree to which the leader instills
values, beliefs, respect, a strong sense of purpose, and collec-
tive sense of mission; intellectual stimulation is the ability to
accept different perspectives and stimulate thinking; indi-
vidualized consideration is appreciating each individual's
contribution; and inspirational motivation is the ability to
motivate and inspire subordinates. These leaders are able to
communicate considerable standards, encourage and pro-
mote followers to align with organizational goals to attain
performance objectives (Imran, Zahoor, & Zaheer, 2012;
Kelloway, Barling, & Helleur, 2000), and assist in enhancing
employee satisfaction and innovative work behavior (Fatima,
Imran, & Zaheer, 2010; Imran, Zaheer, & Noreen, 2011).
However, transactional leaders accomplish goals by reward-
ing subordinates who meet their expectations (Bass & Avolio,
1990a). These rewards may come in the form of pay increase,
advancement, and recognition. However, employees who fail
to perform well are penalized. Such transactions or exchanges
are characterized as effective transactional leadership (Bass,
Avolio, Jung, & Berson, 2003). Moreover, a laissez-faire lead-
ership refers to indifferent or a lack of leadership (Xirasagar,
2008). Therefore, scholars view that both transformational and
transactional leadership styles are necessary for an organiza-
tion in different circumstances. As transformational leadership
performs well when an organization is experiencing rapid
Yasir et al. 3
change, transactional leadership is suitable for an organization
operating in a stable environment (Castiglione, 2006).
OCC
OCC is known as the combination of organizational and
managerial capabilities that allows an enterprise to adapt
more effectively and quickly than its competition to chang-
ing situations (Judge & Douglas, 2009). Judge (2011)
described OCC as "a dynamic, multidimensional capability
that enables an organization to upgrade or revise existing
organizational competencies, while cultivating new compe-
tencies that enable the organization to survive and prosper"
(p. 14). This dynamic capability is critical for all forms of
organizations at some point of time (Oxtoby et al., 2002) and
is associated with higher levels of organizational perfor-
mance (Judge et al., 2015; Ramezan et al., 2013). OCC
enables organizations to adapt and settle old capacities as
well as to cope with newly emerging opportunities (Judge &
Elenkov, 2005).
OCC is affected by human capabilities, structural arrange-
ments, statutes, rules, and regulations that are important for
routine operations and new developments (Judge & Douglas,
2009; Judge, 2011). Judge and Douglas (2009) found eight
distinct but interrelated dimensions of OCC concerning
issues of formal organizational processes, informational
organizational culture and human capabilities. The identified
dimensions of OCC are as follows:
·
· Trustworthy leadership is the ability of top manage-
ment to earn the trust of employees and to guide them
along the path to achieve collective goals.
·
· Innovative culture is the ability of an organization to
encourage innovative activities and establish norms of
innovation.
·
· Involved mid-management refers to the ability of mid-
dle managers/supervisors to effectively link senior
officials with the rest of the organization.
·
· Trusting followers is the ability of non-executive
employees' willingness to follow a new path provided
by the organizational top management, or to construc-
tively dissent it.
·
· Capable champions refers to the ability of an organi-
zation to attract, empower, and retain change leaders
to emerge and evolve.
·
· System thinking is the ability of an organization to rec-
ognize interdependencies within and outside the
organization.
·
· Effective communication refers to the ability of an
organization to effectively communicate horizontally,
vertically, and with customers.
·
· Accountable culture is the ability of the organization
to successfully meet pre-determined deadlines and to
carefully manage resources (Judge & Douglas, 2009).
Leadership and OCC
Leadership has been linked to a variety of positive outcomes
in the previous literature (Khan et al., 2014; Yasir &
Mohamad, 2016). There is lucid evidence that leadership
plays a key role in the process of change and its significant
impact on successful change implementations (Higgs, 2003;
Higgs & Rowland, 2001; Kotter, 1990; Lutz Allen, Smith, &
Da Silva, 2013). Transformational leadership is considered
to be the most appropriate leadership style for effectively
managing the change process. These leaders not only influ-
ence the change process but also facilitate the change process
with their interactive leadership style (Long & Mao, 2008;
Northouse, 2007). These leaders are good mentors who
evoke emotions, foster a trustworthy climate (Harms &
Credé, 2010), and provide a vision for change (Bennis &
Nanus, 1997). Therefore, Lutz Allen et al. (2013) suggested
that individuals must incorporate and adopt the behaviors of
the transformational leadership style for successfully manag-
ing and implementing organizational change. Thus, this
study assumes that transformational leadership will be posi-
tively associated with OCC. Therefore, it is postulated as
follows:
Hypothesis 1: Transformational leadership is positively
related with OCC.
Change is facilitated by a transactional leadership style as
it rewards the positive outcomes (Lowe, Kroeck, &
Sivasubramaniam, 1996). Scholars view that leaders should
be interactive, supportive, and dynamic to acknowledge the
efforts of the employees and their achievements by reward-
ing them (Harms & Credé, 2010; Judge & Piccolo, 2004).
Therefore, previous literature shows a positive relationship
between transactional leadership and organizational change
(Long & Mao, 2008). Moreover, when transactional leaders
focus on rewards (contingent reward), managing incentives,
and meeting quality standards, they play an important role in
supporting and managing organizational change process
(Bass &Avolio, 1990a). Therefore, the present study assumes
that transactional leadership will be positively associated
with OCC. Thus, it is hypothesized as follows:
Hypothesis 2: Transactional leadership is positively
related with OCC.
During the change phase, a continuous interaction
between the leader and followers is vital for success (Kotter,
1995). However, in the case of laissez-faire leadership, there
is minimal interaction between leaders and followers
(Northouse, 2007). Therefore, laissez-faire leadership nega-
tively influences the organizational change process (Lutz
Allen et al., 2013) and negatively influences the change
capability of an organization (Long & Mao, 2008). Therefore,
the current study assumes that laissez-faire leadership will
4 SAGE Open
have a negative relationship with OCC. So, this study pro-
poses the following:
Hypothesis 3: Laissez-faire leadership is negatively
related with OCC.
Employees' Trust
Employees' trust in their leadership is widely acknowledged
as a critical determinant of organizational effectiveness
(Chughtai, Byrne, & Flood, 2015). Previous literature shows
that employees trust in their leadership can lead toward desir-
able outcomes, such as a higher level of performance (Neves
& Caetano, 2009) and greater exchange of ideas and knowl-
edge (Renzl, 2008). In previous literature, trust has been con-
ceptualized in several different ways. For instance, Nyhan
and Marlowe (1997) viewed trust as "the level of confidence
that one individual has in another's competence and his or her
willingness to act in a fair, ethical, and predictable manner"
(p. 616). Moreover, Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, and Camerer
(1998) defined trust as "a psychological state comprising the
intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expecta-
tions of the intentions or behavior of another" (p. 395). Thus,
trust comprises the individuals' beliefs, assumptions, and
expectations regarding the positive outcomes of others'future
behavior (Robinson, 1996). In addition, previous literature
shows that individuals with varying cultural, social, and intel-
lectual background differ in their propensity to trust (Hofstede,
1991; Hofstede & Hofstede, 2001).
Leadership and Employees' Trust
Successful leaders create and maintain employees' trust
through their leadership behavior (Bennis, 2002). Likewise,
a transformational leader understands the individual capa-
bilities and needs of followers, and demonstrates that they
care about followers; therefore, these leaders can be trusted
(Conger, Kanungo, & Menon, 2000; Jung & Avolio, 2000).
Transformational leaders' practice individualized support
and foster acceptance of group goals, which are positively
related to trust in leadership (Butler, Cantrell, & Flick, 1999;
MacKenzie, Podsakoff, & Rich, 2001). Similarly, Gillespie
and Mann (2004) argued that, when leaders act in a way that
builds respect, pride, and confidence of their followers, they
will be trusted. Therefore, employees who believe that their
supervisors are engaged in transformational leadership
behavior will have a higher degree of trust in their leadership
(Holtz & Harold, 2008). Therefore, this study hypothesizes
the following:
Hypothesis 4: Transformational leadership is positively
related with employees' trust.
There exists mixed reporting on the effect of transactional
leadership on employees' trust. Transactional leadership, in
contrast to transformational leadership, is believed to not
acquire a higher level of trust between leaders and followers
(Jung & Avolio, 2000). Some empirical studies report that
transactional leadership does not influence employees trust
in the leader (Pillai, Schriesheim, & Williams, 1999;
Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, & Fetter, 1990), whereas
other studies report a positive association between transac-
tional leadership and employees' trust in the leader (Dirks &
Ferrin, 2002; Shamir, 1995). As transactional leaders reward
subordinates for their compliance with the set directions
(Bass & Riggio, 2006) and leadership style, equipped with a
contingent reward will contribute toward trust-building pro-
cess (Gillespie & Mann, 2004). These leaders admire a fol-
lower's achievements through providing contingent rewards,
thus building employees' trust in their leadership (Shamir,
1995). Therefore, this study proposes the following:
Hypothesis 5: Transactional leadership is positively
related with employees' trust.
Laissez-faire leadership has an unattractive characteristic
toward the trust-building process (Bass, 1985). Employees'
trust in their leadership requires leadership's presence, con-
stant support, and input from the leaders. However, laissez-
faire leadership style means absence of leadership with no or
minimal interaction with employees (Northouse, 2007).
Therefore, scholars assert that laissez-faire leadership fails to
develop employees' trust in the leader (Gillespie & Mann,
2004; Northouse, 2007). Therefore, this study proposes the
following:
Hypothesis 6: Laissez-faire leadership is negatively asso-
ciated with employees' trust.
Employees' Trust and OCC
OCC requires the trust of employees in their organization
and its leadership (Judge, 2011; Soparnot, 2011). Therefore,
change attempts are stifled, if employees'trust in their leader
is inadequate (Ertürk, 2008). Moreover, employees' trust in
their leadership and organization makes them dedicated to
bring about successful change with greater commitment;
thus, the trusting followers become an aide for the overall
change capacity of the organization (Judge, 2011). Thus,
scholars argue about the significance of employees' trust for
OCC in an organization (Judge & Douglas, 2009; Soparnot,
2011). Therefore, this study hypothesizes the following:
Hypothesis 7: Employees' trust is positively related with
OCC.
OCC, Employees' Trust, and Leadership
Scholars argue about the significance of trust as a core emo-
tional and cognitive process in the dynamics of the
Yasir et al. 5
leader­follower's relationship (Bligh & Kohles, 2013). Trust
leads to greater employee confidence in a leader's fair inten-
tions behind the change (Harvey, Royal, & Stout, 2003). Past
research demonstrates that trust in leadership is an important
element for organizational change (Smollan, 2013), and
might be as a consequence or a predecessor of the relation-
ship at work (Neves & Caetano, 2009; Saunders & Thornhill,
2003).
Scholars argue that effective goal achievement by the
employees of an organization during the change phase is
solely dependent upon the level of trust employees have in
their leadership (Kotter, 1995). Scholars also identified that
interpersonal trust within the team members is important for
an organization to perform well during the change phase. It
is dependent upon the way a leader treats her or his subordi-
nates or team members (Ferrin & Dirks, 2003). Therefore,
this study proposes the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 8: Employees' trust mediates the relationship
between transformational leadership and OCC.
Hypothesis 9: Employees' trust mediates the relationship
between transactional leadership and OCC.
Hypothesis 10: Employees' trust mediates the relation-
ship between laissez-faire leadership and OCC.
Method
Sampling
The current study was based on the survey of 11 non-profit
organizations in Pakistan. The sampling frame addressed the
non-profit, community, and project-based organizations
working for women's development (civil rights, education,
health, and economic empowerment) in Pakistan. Data were
collected from a convenient sample of managers, coordina-
tors, officers, community facilitators, social organizers, and
activists through questionnaires. A total number of 250
respondents were sent the questionnaire, and usable ques-
tionnaires were 204 with a response rate of 81%. The sample
consists of 61% female and 39% male, 79% employees
belonged to the age group of 25 to 40 years, and 21% employ-
ees belonged to the age group of 40 to 55 years.
Instruments and Control Variables
Leadership styles (transformational, transactional, and lais-
sez-faire) were measured by using the "Multifactor
Leadership Questionnaire" by Bass and Avolio (1995). The
instrument comprises 36 items, that is, 20 items for transfor-
mational leadership, 12 items for transactional leadership,
and four items for laissez-faire leadership. A sample item
from the instrument is as follows: "My supervisor expresses
confidence that goals will be achieved." The employees'
level of trust in their leader was measured by a scale devel-
oped by Robinson and Rousseau (1994). It comprises seven
items with a sample item as follows: "In general, I believe
my supervisor's motives and intentions are good" and "I am
not sure that I fully trust my supervisor"; the latter item was
reverse coded. The capacity of an organization for change
was measured through the OCC scale developed by Judge
and Douglas (2009) comprising 32 items. Sample item
include the following: "Do frontline employees have oppor-
tunities to voice their concerns about change?" All items
were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale, anchored at 0 = not
at all, 1 = once in a while, 2 = sometimes, 3 = fairly often, and
4 = frequently, if not always.
Age, gender, level of experience, current position, and
level of education were tested as control variables to test
their effect on dependent variables. The results indicated that
these demographic variables had an insignificant effect on
the dependent variable OCC; thus, they can be treated as
control variables.
Results
This section illustrates the results of statistical procedures
applied to test the hypothesized model. This section is
divided into two parts. First part deals with the reliability and
validity of the measurement model using Cronbach's alpha
and inter-construct correlation. In addition, this part also pro-
vides the descriptive statistics of the constructs. Second part
deals with the structural model validation through direct and
indirect effects.
Table 1 exhibits the mean, standard deviation, reliability
statistics, and correlation matrix of the variables. Results
indicate values for Cronbach's alpha which are .93 for OCC,
.87 for transformational leadership, .81 for transactional
leadership, .73 for laissez-faire, and .88 for employees' trust.
All these values are within the acceptable range which is
above .70 (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, & Tatham, 2006).
Table 1 demonstrates that OCC is significantly and posi-
tively correlated with transformational leadership (r = .74,
p < .05), transactional leadership (r =.31, p < .05), and
employees' trust (r =.59, p < .05), whereas laissez-faire lead-
ership (r = -.29, p < .05) is significantly but negatively cor-
related with OCC. This correlation measures the extent and
direction of the relationship between the variables of interest
(Bryman & Cramer, 1990).
Moreover, Table 1 reveals that transformational leader-
ship is significantly and positively correlated to employees'
trust (r = .68, p < .05). The table shows that transactional
leadership and employees' trust (r = .16, p < .05) are signifi-
cantly and positively correlated. Whereas laissez-faire lead-
ership and employees'trust (r = -.32, p < .01) are found to be
significantly but negatively correlated.
Common Method Bias
Scholars argue about the effects of common method bias in
self-reporting variables (Conway & Lance, 2010). Therefore,

previous literature has identified several statistical remedies
to detect and control for any possible common method bias
(Chang, Van Witteloostuijn, & Eden, 2010). This study used
Harman's one-factor test to check for common method bias.
Table 2 shows the overall variance of 21.255%, which is less
than the 50% threshold for substantive common method
variance.
Model Evaluation
For the analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM) has
been used. Preacher and Hayes (2008) suggested path analy-
sis technique to investigate mediation using bootstrapping
technique to overcome criticism raised on Baron and Kenny
(1986) four-step mediation model. Therefore, SEM has
recently become a widely used statistical tool applied in aca-
demic research (Hayes, 2009). For this study, two models
have been tested. Model 1 represents the direct effect between
leadership styles and OCC, whereas Model 2 represents the
indirect effects. Fit indices and path coefficient are shown in
Table 3.
Table 3 describes the models fitness indices using Amos
21 software. The suggested value for chi-square/degree of
freedom ratio (CMIN/DF) is minimum 2 and maximum 5,
whereas the value for goodness of fit index (GFI), adjusted
goodness of fit index (AGFI), normed fit index (NFI), and
comparative fit index (CFI) should be greater than 0.90 and
root mean square of approximation (RMSEA) should not be
greater than 0.08, indicating a good model fit (Hair et al.,
2006). Table 2 shows the model fit values for the hypothe-
sized Model 1, which are CMIN/DF = 3.3, GFI = 0.933,
AGFI = 0.912, NFI = 0.921, CFI = 0.932, and RMSEA =
0.070, this indicates a good fitness of the hypothesized
Model 1. For Model 2, the values are CMIN/DF = 4.2, GFI =
0.919,AGFI = 0.901, NFI = 0.906, CFI = 0.910, and RMSEA
= 0.040, this indicates a good fitness of the hypothesized
Model 2. Therefore, both the models fulfill the threshold val-
ues of GFI, AGFI, NFI, CFI, and RMSEA (see Table 3).
Path coefficients were examined for Model 1, and all the
paths are found to be significant and in line with the stated
hypothesis. Transformational leadership is found to be posi-
tively related with OCC having path coefficient value .67 and p
value less than .05, which provides evidence to support
Hypothesis 1. Transactional leadership is found to be positively
related with OCC having path coefficient value of .20 and p

value less than .05; therefore, Hypothesis 2 is supported.
Laissez-faire leadership is found to be negatively related with
OCC having path coefficient value of -.17 and p value less
than .05; thus, Hypothesis 3 is supported (see Figure 1).
In Model 2, employees'trust has been added as a mediator
between leadership styles and OCC. Path analysis indicates
that transformational leadership has a positive direct effect on
employees' trust with a path coefficient .63 having p value
less than .05; so, Hypothesis 4 is supported. Transactional
leadership has an insignificant relationship with employees'
trust; therefore, Hypothesis 5 is not supported, whereas,
Hypothesis 6 is supported with path coefficient -.21 and p
value less than .05, and indicates a negative relationship
between laissez-faire leadership and employees'trust. Finally,
employees' trust and OCC were found to have a positive
direct relationship, with path coefficient .59 and p value less
than .05; therefore, Hypothesis 7 is supported (see Figure 2).
This study investigated the mediating role of employees'
trust in the relationship between leadership styles and OCC.
Therefore, indirect effects have been examined as suggested
by Preacher and Hayes (2008) using bootstrapping technique
with 1,000 iterations to test the significance of indirect
effects (see Table 4).
The indirect effect of transformational leadership
(TFL) on OCC through employees' trust (ET) is having
path coefficient value .37 and is significant with p value
less than .05. Ratio of indirect effects to the total effect is
55.3%. Moreover, upper confidence level was 0.49 and
lower confidence level was 0.11 (zero is not between the
lower and upper confidence level). Thus, ET mediates the
relationship between TFL and OCC; hence, Hypothesis 8
is supported.
The indirect effect of transactional leadership (TSL)
on OCC through ET is having path coefficient value .03
and is insignificant, which indicates that employees'
trust does not mediate the relationship between transac-
tional leadership and OCC; thus, Hypothesis 9 is not
supported.
The indirect effect of laissez-faire leadership (LFL) on
OCC through ET is having path coefficient value -.12 and is
significant with p value less than .05. Ratio of indirect effects
to the total effect is 72.3%. Furthermore, upper confidence
level was -0.07 and lower confidence level was -0.20. Thus,
employees' trust in their leadership mediates the relationship
between laissez-faire and OCC; therefore, Hypothesis 10 is
supported.

Discussion
Findings from this study, based on 204 employees from the
non-profit organizations of Pakistan, provided enough sup-
port to all of our propositions with the exception of two.
First, there was no significant relationship found between
transactional leadership and employees' trust. Second,
employees' trust was not found to mediate the relationship
between transactional leadership and OCC.
Past literature provides evidence that leadership plays an
important role toward OCC, as transformational leadership is
found to have a positive impact on the change process
(Brown, 1994; Long & Mao, 2008). Furthermore, Soparnot
(2011) identified that transformational leadership plays a sig-
nificant contribution toward OCC of an organization.
Moreover, Lutz Allen et al. (2013) suggested that individuals
must adopt the behaviors of transformational leadership style
for successful implementation of organizational change, par-
ticularly in non-profit organizations. Thus, transformational
leadership facilitates OCC and increases the likelihood for
successful management and implementation of change.
Previous literature also shows the existence of a positive
association between transactional leadership and change
(Bass & Avolio, 1990a; Long & Mao, 2008).
Moreover, Lowe et al. (1996) suggested that change is
also facilitated by the transactional leadership style as it
rewards the positive outcomes. Therefore, transactional lead-
ers who acknowledge their subordinate's efforts by encour-
aging and rewarding them will play an important role in
supporting OCC. The current research also proposed a nega-
tive relationship between laissez-faire leadership and OCC.
Findings from the study also reported this relationship.
Previous literature shows that laissez-faire leadership is neg-
atively associated with change capability of an organization
(Long & Mao, 2008). As the interaction between leaders and
followers is essential for successful change phase (Kotter,
1995), however, in laissez-faire leadership, there exists mini-
mum interaction between leaders and followers (Northouse,
2007). Therefore, laissez-faire leadership negatively affects
the change process, particularly in non-profit organizations
(Lutz Allen et al., 2013). Hence, individuals with laissez-
faire leadership behavior will negatively affect OCC.
The results of this study reveal a positive relationship
between transformational leadership and employees' trust in
the leader. Our findings are similar to the previous literature
which identifies the positive relationship between transfor-
mational leadership and employees' trust in leaders (Conger
et al., 2000; Gillespie & Mann, 2004; Holtz & Harold, 2008;
Jung &Avolio, 2000; Kotter, 1995; Pawar & Eastman, 1997).
Scholars assert that transformational leadership behavior
builds confidence of their followers (Gillespie & Mann,
2004), motivates and inspires them (Bass & Avolio, 1990a),
and shares a vision of the organization with them, which con-
tributes toward the trust-building process (Pawar & Eastman,
1997). These leaders understand individual needs of follow-
ers and assist them; thereby followers tend to trust their lead-
ership (Conger et al., 2000; Jung & Avolio, 2000). Therefore,
transformational leadership behavior will assist in develop-
ing the trust of the employees in their leadership, due to their
inspiring and motivational attitude. However, the current
research exhibits that there is no association between trans-
actional leadership and employees'trust in non-profit organi-
zations of Pakistan, as mixed evidences of the nature of
association between transactional leadership and employees'
trust exist in previous literature. Pillai et al. (1999) and
Podsakoff et al. (1990) provided empirical evidence that
transactional leadership does not influence a follower's trust.
The concept of transactional leadership is based on contin-
gent rewards, which is rewarding the positive outcomes and
punishing for poor performance (Northouse, 2007). However,
transactional leaders are unlikely to motivate, inspire, and
address individual needs of the followers; hence, transac-
tional leadership behavior does not assist in developing an
employee's trust in the leader, specifically in the non-profit
organizations of Pakistan. However, there is an existence of
a significant though negative relationship between laissez-
faire leadership and employees' trust. Findings of this
research are congruent with the postulations of early
researchers (Northouse, 2007), as laissez-faire leadership has
an unattractive behavior toward trust-building process due to
their minimal input, support, and interaction with followers.
Thus, laissez-faire leadership behavior negatively affects an
employee's trust in their leadership.

Scholars' argue that employees' trust in their leader
plays a crucial role in achieving a higher level of OCC; in
addition, trust can be strengthened (or destroyed) during
the course of discussions and acts (Soparnot, 2011). Thus,
employees' trust in their leader positively contributes
toward OCC, as results of the current study reveal a sig-
nificant and positive relationship between employees' trust
and OCC. Findings of the present research are in line with
previous studies (Judge, 2011; Judge et al., 2006; Soparnot,
2006; Soparnot, 2011). Past researches identify that a suc-
cessful change process depends upon the level of employ-
ees' trust in their leadership (Kotter, 1995; Smollan, 2013),
and employees who trust their leaders will assist the change
capacity of an organization (Judge, 2011). Therefore,
transformational leaders build trust of the employees in
their leadership for the reason that they engage employees
in the change process, inspire them, and appreciate them
for their contribution, which positively affects OCC.
Previous literature also identifies that laissez-faire leader-
ship negatively affects trust of the employees in their lead-
ership (Northouse, 2007) and organizational change (Long
& Mao, 2008; Lutz Allen et al., 2013). However, findings
of the current study show that if employees' trust their
leaders, even if they have laissez-faire leadership behavior,
employees' trust will assist in decreasing the negative
effects of laissez-faire leadership on OCC. Although, in
most cases, laissez-faire leadership fails to produce
employees'trust, therefore, its positive contribution toward
OCC through employees' trust can be an exceptional case
from the non-profit organizations of Pakistan. But, employ-
ees' trust was not found to play a mediating role in the
relationship between transactional leadership and OCC,
because transactional leadership behavior fails to build
employees' trust in the current study findings. However,
transactional leadership has a positive relationship with
OCC.
The current study has laid the foundation to test the newly
emerging concept of change management with other vari-
ables. The study examined the relationship of leadership
styles (i.e., transformational leadership, transactional leader-
ship, and laissez-faire leadership) with OCC, which is a
novel contribution to the literature of leadership and change
management. The research has also created a link between
the two change management paradigms, that is, management
and complex. The study has found a significantly positive
relationship between transformational leadership and OCC.
Transformational leadership is a part of the driving dimen-
sion of the management paradigm in the theories and con-
cepts of change management (Klarner, Probst, & Soparnot,
2007), whereas OCC is a part of the complex paradigm
(Judge & Elenkov, 2005). Establishing a link between the
two different components of management paradigm and
complex paradigm, that is, transformational leadership and
OCC, is a promising and unique contribution within the
change management literature.
Limitations and Future Research
Constructs of leadership styles, employees' trust, and OCC
have been examined unidimensionally. Impact of the facets
of leadership behavior, that is, idealized influence, inspira-
tional motivation, intellectual stimulation, individualized
consideration, contingent reward, management by excep-
tion-active, and management by exception-passive, are rec-
ommended to be tested individually with OCC in a future
study. Moreover, the current study sample is from the non-
profit organizations. Future studies should consider the role
of leadership styles and employees' trust for OCC in private
(for profit) or public sector organizations. Another limitation
was its cross-sectional research design. Also, the examina-
tion of the process of leadership behavior and employees'
trust, and its impact on OCC requires a relatively longer
period. For instance, the relevance of pre-existing levels of
trust and tendency to trust were not examined. Therefore, a
follow-up of this study may be performed with a longitudinal
study design, which will present a true picture of perceived
trustworthiness of change leaders. In addition, a more
enriched comparison should be completed with culturally
diverse organizations exploring cross-cultural replication of
this study, thereby adding depth to the existing knowledge.
Finally, the present study respondents were from both long-
and short-term projects of the non-profit organizations.
Future studies may examine the current model in long- and
short-term projects separately, or make a comparative study
of it. The current research uses a convenient sampling design
that is simple to use but is vulnerable and lacks generaliz-
ability. Future researches may use a reliable sampling design.
Conclusion
Organizations aiming toward successful transformation,
based on their capacity to change, need to focus on their
leadership behavior. For successful implementation and
management of the change process, organizations are
required to develop their capacity for change, which
demands active, supportive, responsive, interactive, and
trustworthy leadership. Transformational leadership is
found to be much more successful in developing the change
capacity of an organization, because the leaders are inspir-
ing, active, and supportive. Similarly, transactional leader-
ship also seems to have an important role, while laissez-faire
leadership negatively influences the change capacity of an
organization. Therefore, top management, while going
through the change phase, needs to avoid the laissez-faire
leadership style, and focus more on the transformational
leadership behavior with a complementing role of transac-
tional leadership behavior to the extent of rewarding
employees' efforts for successfully managing the change
phase. Finally, employees' trust plays a crucial role in
developing OCC as the present study shows that, if employ-
ees trust their leaders, even if they have the laissez-faire
10 SAGE Open
leadership behavior, the trust factor can minimize the direct
negative effect of laissez-faire leadership on OCC.
