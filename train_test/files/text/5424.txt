ABSTRACT
The SVZ (subventricular zone) contains neural stem cells and
progenitorsofvariouspotentialities.Althoughinitiallyparsed
into A, B, and C cells, this germinal zone is comprised of a
significantly more diverse population of cells. Here, we char-
acterized a subset of postnatal PRPs (PDGF-AA-responsive
precursors) that express functional PDGF and  receptors
from birth to adulthood. When grown in PDGF-AA, dissoci-
ated neonatal rat SVZ cells divided to produce non-adherent
clusters of progeny. Unlike the self-renewing EGF/FGF-2-
responsive precursors that produce neurospheres, these PRPs
failed to self-renew after three passages; therefore, we refer
to the colonies they produce as spheroids. Upon differen-
tiation these spheroids could produce neurons, type 1 as-
trocytes and oligodendrocytes. When maintained in medium
supplemented with BMP-4 they also produced type 2 as-
trocytes. Using lineage tracing methods, it became evident
that there were multiple types of PRPs, including a subset
that could produce neurons, oligodendrocytes, and type 1
and type 2 astrocytes; thus some of these PRPs represent
a unique population of precursors that are quatropotential.
Spheroids also could be generated from the newborn neo-
cortex and they had the same potentiality as those from
the SVZ. By contrast, the adult neocortex produced less than
20% of the numbers of spheroids than the adult SVZ and
spheroids from the adult neocortex only differentiated into
glial cells. Interestingly, SVZ spheroid producing capacity di-
minished only slightly from birth to adulthood. Altogether

INTRODUCTION
The SVZ (subventricular zone), most pronounced in the dor-
solateral wall of the lateral ventricle, is comprised of a het-
erogeneous cell population consisting of NSCs (neural stem
cells) and progenitors of various potentialities. Precursors
isolated from the SVZ have been shown to be EGF (epi-
dermal growth factor)- and FGF (fibroblast growth factor)-
responsive (Reynolds et al., 1992; Reynolds and Weiss, 1992;
Gritti et al., 1995, 1999), but more recent studies have deter-
mined that another subset of cells in the SVZ express recep-
tors that respond to PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor)
(Jackson et al., 2006; Assanah et al., 2009). PDGF has been
shown to stimulate the growth of PDGFR (PDGF receptor )-
positive cells from both the embryonic and the adult mouse
SVZ (Chojnacki and Weiss, 2004; Jackson et al., 2006).
In the neonatal period, the SVZ is a major source of glial
progenitors. These glial progenitors migrate from the SVZ
ventro-laterally to the adjacent striatum and dorsally to the
white matter and the neocortical gray matter, where they

can give rise to both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Levi-
son et al., 2005; Levison and Goldman, 2006; Zhu et al., 2008).
Whereas the architecture and composition of adult SVZ has
been richly described (Doetsch et al., 1997; Alvarez-Buylla
and Garcia-Verdugo, 2002; Giachino et al., 2014), the new-
born SVZ has received less attention, even though studies
suggest that it is far more complex.
The newborn SVZ has been shown to contain unipoten-
tial astrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitors as well as
bipotential glial progenitors (Levison and Goldman, 1997).
PDGFR is generally agreed to be a factor essential for
oligodendroglial development and has been shown to be
expressed by neuroepithelial cells as early as E8.5 (Andrae
et al., 2001). In the neonate, PDGFR is expressed by oligo-
dendrocyte precursors and their PSA-NCAM + (polysialated
neural cell adhesion molecule positive) pre-progenitors (Ben-
Hur et al., 1998). These PSA-NCAM + pre-progenitors have
been isolated from P6 cerebral white matter by immunopan-
ning and shown to generate oligodendrocytes and astrocytes
in vitro (Grinspan et al., 1990a, 1990b). Upon characteri-
zation, these PSA-NCAM + cells lacked markers for O-2A
(oligodendrocyte-type 2 astrocyte) progenitors, such as GD3
and yet were able to give rise to O-2A cells that differentiated
into type 2 astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Grinspan et al.,
1990a). Other studies established that PDGF is a survival fac-
tor for these PSA-NCAM + pre-progenitors (Grinspan and
Franceschini, 1995; Ben-Hur et al., 1998). When differenti-
ated, they produced large percentages of oligodendrocytes
and astrocytes, as well as a few neurons. However, clonal
analyses were not performed to determine whether there
was a common bipotential precursor or whether there were
two sets of glial-restricted precursors that each expressed
PDGFR.
Some studies suggest that there are other multipoten-
tial precursors in the SVZ that are PDGFR + . Although
PDGFR + SVZ cells are generally associated with gliogene-
sis, there are PRPs (PDGF-responsive precursors) of the E14
ventral forebrain that are tripotential, giving rise to oligo-
dendrocytes, astrocytes and neurons (Chojnacki and Weiss,
2004). Furthermore, in the adult brain, it has been reported
that there is a subset of GFAP + (glial fibrillary acidic pro-
tein) Type B cells that are also PDGFR + (Jackson et al.,
2006). A more recent study, however, concluded that the
PDGFR + precursors are not stem cells, and thus distinct
from the GFAP + adult stem cells of both mouse and human
SVZ (Chojnacki et al., 2011).
Much of the research investigating PRPs of the SVZ have
either focused on the glial-restricted precursors or multi-
potential cells of embryonic brain and some of these stud-
ies are contradictory (Jackson et al., 2006; Chojnacki et al.,
2008; Jackson and Alvarez-Buylla, 2008; Chojnacki et al.,
2011). To date, the PDGFR + cells of the neonatal SVZ have
been poorly characterized. Therefore, the goal of this study
was to investigate this interesting subset of SVZ cells. We
sought to characterize their growth requirements, to deter-
mine whether they are stem cells or progenitors, to evaluate
whether this is a homogeneous or diverse cell population and
to assess their relative abundance across the lifespan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Spheroid cultures
Cultures were established from Wistar rat brains across
a spectrum of ages, from postnatal day 3 (P3) to
adult (P70) as well as from SD (Sprague­Dawley) rat
pups that ubiquitously expressed GFP [Sprague-Dawley-
Tg(GFP)Bal/2Rrrc (RRRC:0065) (Missouri Research Animal Di-
agnostics Laboratory)]. Newborn rats were decapitated un-
der sterile conditions and their brains were placed into PBS
with 0.6% glucose and 2 mM MgCl2
. Adult rats were eu-
thanized by carbon dioxide inhalation prior to decapitation.
Incisions were made 2 mm from the anterior end of the
brain and 3 mm posterior to the first cut. These blocks
were transferred to fresh PBS-glucose-MgCl2
and the SVZDL
and dorsal cerebral cortex were grossly isolated. Isolated tis-
sue was minced with a scalpel and/or forceps. The tissue
was then transferred to conical tubes and centrifuged at
200 g for 5 min. The pellet was enzymatically dissociated us-
ing a 2:3 dilution of Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies)
or an enzyme solution containing trypsin (0.25%), collage-
nase III (0.001 g), papain (0.01 g), DNase I (0.0002 g), MgSO4
(0.00385 g) and L-cysteine (0.0175 g) dissolved into 10 ml of
MEM-Hepes. The neonatal tissue was digested for 5­10 min
and adult tissue for 20 min at 37C with manual agita-
tion during incubation. An equal volume of medium sup-
plemented to 10% NCS (newborn calf serum) was added and
the mixture was triturated for several cycles using P1000
and P100 tips, adding additional media during later cycles.
The single-cell suspension was passed through a 100 m cell
strainer and then a 40 m strainer to eliminate clumped
cells from the final mixture. Then the cells were centrifuged
at 200 g for 5 min and the supernatant removed.
Viable cells were counted and plated at 3.75×104,
7.5×104 or 1.5×105 cells/ml in ProN media [DMEM (Dul-
becco's modified Eagle's medium)/F12 medium contain-
ing 10 ng/ml D-biotin, 25 g/ml insulin, 20 nM proges-
terone, 100 M putrescine, 5 ng/ml selenium, 50 g/ml
apo-transferrin and 50 g/ml gentamycin (all purchased
from Sigma­Aldrich, except gentamycin that was purchased
from Life Technologies)]. ProN medium was supplemented
with 30% B104 neuroblastoma conditioned medium (B104
CM) (Young and Levison, 1997), 10 ng/ml recombinant rat
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-AA) (R&D Systems),
50 ng/mL noggin (R&D Systems) or 20 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech)
and 5 ng/ml FGF-2 (Peprotech) with 1 ng/ml heparin sulfate
(Sigma­Aldrich). PRPs were allowed to grow into spheroids
for 7­10 DIV (days in vitro) in 2% O2
, 5% CO2
, 93% N2

at 37C. To dissociate the
spheroids, cells were either treated with Accutase or a pH-
balanced solution containing collagenase III (0.002 g), pa-
pain (200 units), and DNase I (0.0002 g) in 10 ml of Papain
Buffer [DMEM/F12 with 0.48 g of Hepes, 0.02 g of EDTA and
0.0175 g of L-cysteine]. Spheroids were continuously pas-
saged by digestion in Accutase followed by mechanical trit-
uration. Viable cells were plated at 7.5×104 cells/ml in 50%
spheroid conditioned media. To differentiate the spheroids,
they were plated with or without dissociation in N2B2 me-
dia [ProN supplemented with 0.66 mg/ml BSA and either a
0.5% or 20% fetal bovine serum or 10 ng/ml BMP-4 (bone
morphogenetic protein 4) (R&D Systems)] for 72 h. All an-
imal work was performed according to Institutional Ani-
mal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines of UMDNJ,
protocol #10012.
Western blot
Spheroids (grown in ProN supplemented with PDGF-AA) and
neurospheres (grown in ProN supplemented with EGF
and FGF-2) were cultured for 7 DIV in 2% O2
, 5% CO2
and
93% N2
as previously described (Alagappan et al., 2013).
To evaluate responsiveness to PDGF, spheroids were growth-
factor-starved for 6 h and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml
PDGF-AA. Untreated spheroids were collected at 15 min and
treated spheroids were collected at either 15 or 30 min
after PDGF-AA addition. OPCs (oligodendrocyte progenitor
cells) were generated from mixed glial cultures prepared
from neonatal rat brains. Meninges were collected from the
same animals prior to isolating deeper tissues. Cells were
collected by gentle centrifugation and then lysed with 1%
Triton-X100, 0.1% SDS, 1% 0.1 M sodium orthovanadate
and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics) dissolved
in PBS. The cells were sonicated then centrifuged at 9300 g
for 15 min at 4C. The protein concentration was quanti-
fied with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoScien-
tific). Twenty-five g of denatured protein was loaded on
to a 4­12% Novex NuPage Bis Tris Gel (Invitrogen) then
transferred to nitrocellulose (Invitrogen). Blots were probed
with rabbit anti-PDGFR (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technol-
ogy), rabbit anti-PDGFR (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technol-
ogy), rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (mitogen-activated
protein kinase) [pERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated ki-
nase 1/2)] (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-
p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology),
and mouse anti--actin (1:5000, Sigma­Aldrich), washed and
incubated with secondary antibody against rabbit or mouse
conjugated to HRP (horseradish peroxidase) (1:2500, Jack-
son ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Signals were detected by
chemiluminescence-ECL (PerkinElmer) and quantified using
a UVP Bioimaging system.
Immunofluorescence
Cells were fixed with 4% PFA (paraformaldehyde) and
stained with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temper-
ature (20C) or overnight at 4C, using mouse anti-PSA-
NCAM (1:500, Millipore), O4 (1:5, supernatant), A2B5 (1:4,
supernatant), D1.1 (1:4, supernatant), R24 (1:4, supernatant),
Rmab (1:3, supernatant), TuJ1 (1:400, Covance), rabbit anti-
NG2 (1:200, generously provided by Bill Stallcup), rabbit anti-
Olig2 (1:500, Millipore) and rabbit anti-GFAP (1:500, Dako)
antibodies.
For additional differentiation experiments, single cells (2­
4×104 cells/well) or whole spheroids (10­20 spheroids/well)
were plated on to PDL and laminin-coated chamber slides
and fed with N2B2 media or N2B3 media [N2B2 with 30 nM
T3 (triiodothyronine)] and 2% NCS and maintained in an at-
mospheric incubator overnight to allow cells to adhere to
the slides. The differentiation media was replaced with ei-
ther N2B2 + 0.5% FBS, N2B3 + 0.5% FBS or N2B2 + 0.5%
FBS supplemented with 10 ng/ml human BMP-4 (R&D Sys-
tems) for 3­5 DIV. To identify astrocytes, oligodendrocytes
and neurons, cells were stained live for O4, Rmab, or A2B5
for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed and incubated with ap-
propriate fluorochome-conjugated secondary antibodies for
1 h at room temperature. The cells were fixed for 5 min in
4% PFA and sometimes 100% methanol, blocked, and then
incubated with TuJ1 and GFAP. The cells were washed and
further incubated with secondary antibodies. Some cells were
counterstained with DAPI for 10 min.
Stained cells were washed thoroughly and mounted with
Fluorogel (EMS) and allowed to dry overnight. Immunore-
active cells were visualized using an Olympus Provis AX70
microscope and images of stained cells were collected using
a Photometrics cooled charged coupled device camera inter-
faced with IP Lab scientific imaging software (Scanalytics).
Labeled cells in at least four random (non-adjacent) fields
were counted per well under a 20× or 40× objective and
a total of four wells per independent group were evaluated
with at least 100 cells counted based on DAPI staining. To
evaluate the potentiality of a single spheroid, a minimum of
60 spheroids per group were assessed for their potentially.
pNIT retrovirus production, cell infection and
clonal analysis
Replication-deficient viruses with VSV-g coats were gener-
ated from pNIT- plasmid (Milosevic and Goldman, 2002) as
previously described (Bain et al., 2010). Briefly, pNIT-293 cells
were maintained with 0.8 mg/ml G418 in DMEM with 10%
NCS. Cells were split on to seven PDL-coated plates in media
lacking G418 2­3 days before transfection. When pNIT-293
cells were 90­95% confluent, a VSV-g plasmid was trans-
fected into the cells using LipofectamineTM 2000 Reagent
(Life Technologies). Supernatant from transfected virus pro-
ducing cells were collected after 2­3 days and titered by
incubating NIH 3T3 cells with serial dilutions of retrovirus.
The CFU was calculated by multiplying the number of GFP +
cell clusters by the dilution factor.
SVZ cells from Wistar neonates were propagated as
spheroids and then gently dissociated into a single cell

suspension and seeded at 2×104 cells/well on to PDL-coated
chamber slides in ProN with or without B104 CM supple-
mented with 2% serum and maintained in an atmospheric
incubator for 6­12 h. Dissociated cells were infected with 50
CFU pNIT retrovirus followed by medium replacement 24 h
later to N2B2 + 0.5% FBS. Media was changed every other
day for 7 days, after which cells were fixed in 4% PFA and
stained for GFP (Aves Labs), O4, GFAP and TUJ1.
In a separate set of experiments, SVZ cells from GFP-
expressing SD rats were dissociated and mixed with SVZ cells
isolated from wild-type SD rats at an initial cell ratio of 1:150,
1:75, 1:30 and 1:15. These cells were propagated as spheroids
and then seeded as whole spheroids (30 spheres/well) on
to PDL and laminin-coated chamber slides in ProN with 2%
serum. Media (N2B2 + 0.5% FBS) was changed every other
day for 7 days, after which cells were fixed in 4% PFA and
stained for GFP, O4, GFAP and TUJ1.
Limiting dilution assay
Primary spheroids and neurospheres were cultured as previ-
ously described above, dissociated and plated into a 96-well
plate with a minimum of six replicate wells per condition.
Cells were plated at 1000, 750, 500, 250, 100, and 50 cells per
well in 200 l of ProN supplemented with 10 ng/ml PDGF-AA
or 20 ng/ml EGF and 10 ng/ml FGF-2 with 50% conditioned
media. After 7 DIV wells were scored for the presence of at
least one sphere per well. To discern a sphere from a cluster of
cells the cell suspension was pipetted several times and then
analyzed. To measure the fraction of sphere-forming cells
where  equals the number of positive wells and r equals
the total number of wells, the Poisson discrete distribution
probability (Fr
= r
r !
e-) was used where negative wells
(Fo
= e-) and positive wells (F1
= e-) are plotted as a
semi log plot (Lefkovits and Waldmann, 1999).
Statistical analysis
Results were analyzed for statistical significance using a Stu-
dent's t test or by ANOVA with Fisher's PLSD post-hoc test.
Error bars represent S.E.M. Comparisons were interpreted as
significant when associated with P < 0.05.
RESULTS
The postnatal SVZ is a mosaic of precursors that have the po-
tential to produce many different types of neurons and glia
of the nervous system. The neurosphere culture method pro-
vides the means to propagate NSCs as well as their progeny;
however, there are other precursors residing in the SVZ that
have been less well studied. Importantly, to date there is
no accepted cell culture system for growing the tripotential
and bipotential progenitors of the SVZ. Here we specifically
sought to optimize an in vitro system to culture PRPs and to
characterize their developmental potential.

Spheroids and neurospheres were generated from neonatal SVZs and cultured
for 7 DIV in 2% O2
, 5% CO2
, 93% N2
. OPCs were generated from mixed glial cell
cultures from neonatal rat brains. (A) Expression levels of pERK1/2 (44,42 kDa)
and total ERK1/2 (44,42 kDa) in 6 h growth factor-starved spheroids untreated
(T0) or treated with 10 ng/ml PDGF-AA stimulation for 15 min (T15) and 30 min
(T30). (B) Expression levels of PDGFR (195 kDa) and PDGFR (185 kDa) in
OPCs, spheroids, neurospheres and meninges. Data are representative of two
independent experiments.
To propagate PRPs, the SVZs of neonatal rats were mi-
crodissected from the brain, dissociated into a single-cell
suspension and grown in a hormone-supplemented medium
containing 10 ng/ml PDGF-AA. Over several days in vitro
these precursors divided and formed clonal clusters that grew
independent of the substrate, like the neurospheres formed
by NSCs. However, these colonies are distinct from neuro-
spheres; therefore, we will refer to these clusters as spheroids.
For example, the spheroids were less compact than the con-
ventionally studied neurospheres.
Levels of phosphorylated ERKs were measured to deter-
mine whether the PRPs within the spheroids were responsive
to exogenous PDGF-AA. After a 6 h starvation period (T0),
pERK-1 and 2 were detected as a doublet that migrated at
44 and 42 kDa (Figure 1A). Upon addition of PDGF-AA to
achieve 10 ng/ml in the media, levels of both pERK-1 and 2
increased above baseline by 15 min (T15) and 30 min (T30).
To determine whether the cells in the spheroids ex-
pressed either or both the  or  isoforms of the PDGFRs,
Western blotting was performed using well-characterized
antibodies against these receptors (Figure 1B). OPCs and
meningeal fibroblasts were used as positive controls for
the PDGFR and PDGFR, respectively. A band that mi-
grated at 195 kDa was seen using the antibody for
PDGFR. The relative expression levels for the PDGFR
were as follows, OPCs>neurospheres>meninges>spheroids.
A band that migrated at 185 kDa was seen using the
antibody for PDGFR. The expression of this receptor

ence or absence of markers. Data represents averages of three independent

differed from that of the PDGFR with expression as
follows: meninges>spheroids>neurospheres>OPCs. These
studies verified that the PRPs do indeed express PDGFR
and lower levels of PDGFR.
Cells propagated as spheroids were characterized using
a panel of stem, progenitor and lineage-restricted antigens
(Table 1). The majority of cells within a spheroid were PSA-
NCAM + (78%), while 39% expressed the oligodendrocyte
transcription factor 2 (Olig2). About one-third expressed
nestin (34%) and GFAP was present in 21%. Of the markers
that label O-2A cells, 19.1% and 17.5% were immunoreac-
tive for A2B5 and R24 surface antigens, and 26% expressed
the NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Less than 10%
labeled using the D1.1 monoclonal antibody.
As we were interested in creating a culture system favor-
able for studying early progenitors, and as PSA- NCAM has
been reported to be expressed on early neural and glial pro-
genitors, we evaluated several medium formulations for their
ability to enrich for PSA-NCAM + cells (Figure 2A). The basal
media for all cultures was a hormone-supplemented, serum-
free media. One test medium was supplemented with B104
CM +
- noggin, a BMP antagonist. BMPs have been previously
established to contribute to astrocyte specification (Mabie et
al., 1997; Grinspan et al., 2000); therefore, noggin was added
to neutralize any BMPs that might be generated by the pro-
genitors. The other medium formulation was supplemented
with 10 ng/ml PDGF-AA.
Contrary to our hypothesis, the addition of noggin had no
effect on spheroid formation. Furthermore, we found no sig-
nificant difference in the total percentage of PSA-NCAM +
cells, regardless of the growth conditions, with the aver-
age percentage ranging from 74.9% to 82% PSA-NCAM +
cells (Figure 2A). The relative GFAP + cell percentages ranged
from 11.1% to 21.6% among groups. To assess the differenti-
ation potential, the spheroids were dissociated and differen-
tiated for 4 days. All four conditions generated similar ratios
of type 1 astrocytes to oligodendrocytes, with low levels of
O4 - /GFAP - cells (Figure 2B).
The effect of the initial plating cell density on the number
of spheroids formed was evaluated since cells secrete growth
and trophic factors that conditions the medium and, there-
fore, density may affect their growth. Spheroids were plated
at initial densities of 1.5×105 cells/ml, 7.5×104 cells/ml and
3.75×104 cells/ml and maintained for 10 days (Figure 3A).
These studies showed that cell density was crucial for pri-
mary spheroid development. There was a non-linear decrease
in spheroids formed at the lowest cell density (0.375×105
cells/ml) within both O2
conditions (Figure 3B). Interestingly,
when cells plated at the lowest density were provided condi-
tioned media from the cells cultured at the highest density
there was a robust recovery of spheroid formation. In the
following experiments cells were plated at an initial density
of 0.75×105cells/ml.
Extracellular O2
and intracellular reactive oxygen species
can regulate the balance between self-renewal and differ-
entiation in neural precursors (Smith et al., 2000; Noble et
al., 2003; Le Belle et al., 2011); therefore, superphysiological
levels of O2
could affect the proliferation and differentiation
of the spheroids. To determine whether O2
had an effect on
rat spheroid growth, neonatal rat SVZ cells were cultured in
either 2% O2
or 20% O2
(Figure 3A). Spheroids were gen-
erated in all culture conditions and there was no significant
difference in spheroid numbers as a function of O2
level (Fig-
ure 3B). However, spheroids grown in 2% O2
were generally
larger than those grown in 20% O2
(Figure 3A). In subsequent
experiments cultures were maintained in 2% O2
.
To determine whether O2
would affect macroglia mat-
uration, spheroids generated in 2% O2
were differentiated
in either 2% or 20% O2
for 5 days. In these experiments
there was no significant difference in the percentages of
O4 + or GFAP + cells differentiated in 2% or 20% O2
(Fig-
ure 3C). However, the morphology of the differentiated O4 +
cells varied with O2
concentration. Oligodendrocytes formed
when differentiated in 2% O2
possessed fine processes and
fewer myelin-like sheets (Figure 3D') and, therefore, may be
less mature than the oligodendrocytes differentiated in 20%
O2
that displayed a more mature morphology (Figure 3D"). In
general the SVZ is not a heavily vascularized region, therefore,
the lower O2
conditions may sustain cells in a less differenti-
ated state. In subsequent experiments, cells were allowed to
differentiate in 20% O2
.
Several studies have provided thyroid hormone to en-
hance oligodendrocyte production from glial precursors (Baas
et al., 1997; Jones et al., 2003; Chojnacki and Weiss, 2004).
Therefore, we added thyroid hormone (T3) to the spheroid
growth medium; however, no significant difference in the
percentage of O4 + cells in the presence or absence of
T3 was observed (Figure 3E). Similarly, the ratio of cells
that differentiated into immature oligodendrocytes (O4 + )
or type 1 astrocytes (GFAP + ) remained constant. In subse-
quent experiments cells were differentiated in the absence
of T3. Population studies have provided evidence for the
existence of embryonic PRPs that can generate both neu-
rons and glia, whereas postnatal PRPs have been generally

regarded as glial restricted precursors. Therefore, we sought
to determine whether the postnatal SVZ PRPs were multipo-
tential (Figure 4). SVZ cells were cultured in media containing
EGF/FGF-2, B104 CM or PDGF-AA. After 8­10 DIV the neu-
rospheres (Figure 4A) or spheroids (Figures 4B and 4C) were
differentiated for 5 days in the absence of growth factors
on PDL and laminin-coated chamber slides. All three culture
media supported macroglia growth as expected (Figures 4A2,
4B2, 4C2, 4A3, 4B3 and 4C3). Unexpectedly, B104 CM and
PDGF-AA supplemented media also produced TUJI + neurons
as did the EGF/FGF-2 responsive NSCs (Figures 4A1, 4B1 and
4C1). In fact, when individual neurospheres were analyzed,
64% had at least one neuron present although the bulk of
cells were oligodendrocytes and astrocytes (Figure 4D2). Sim-
ilarly, the majority of spheroids (Figures 4D1 and 4D3) were
tripotential. Interestingly, the EGF/FGF-2 responsive neuro-
spheres and PDGF-AA responsive spheroids had almost iden-
tical differentiation ratios where 64% were tripotential, ap-
proximately 30% were bipotential producing astrocytes and
oligodendrocytes, 3% were bipotential producing neurons
and astrocytes, and approximately 5% were unipotential re-
stricted to only astrocyte production (Figures 4D1 and 4D2).

The neurospheres and spheroids that only contained astro-
cytes were significantly smaller than the spheres or spheroids
that were tri- or bipotential. We did not observe any bipoten-
tial spheroids containing neurons and astrocytes or unipo-
tential spheroids when cultured in B104 CM (Figure 4D3).
We next sought to determine whether the spheroids
could also produce type 2 astrocytes. For these experiments
spheroids from the SVZ and neocortex were grown and differ-
entiated in either 0.5% or 20% FBS (Figure 5). After 3 days,
cells were stained for the oligodendrocyte marker, Rmab (Fig-
ures 4A1, 4B1 and 4C1), the O-2A cell and type 2 astrocyte
marker A2B5 (Figures 5A2, 5B2 and 5C2) and the interme-
diate filament protein of both type 1 and type 2 astrocytes,
GFAP (Figures 5A3, 5B3 and 5C3). All conditions produced
Rmab + oligodendrocytes and A2B5 - /GFAP + type 1 as-
trocytes. Confirming our predictions, there were few, if any,
A2B5 + /GFAP + type 2 astrocytes when differentiated in
the presence of 0.5% FBS (Figure 4A4), whereas there was
a robust production of type 2 astrocytes from the SVZ (Fig-
ure 5B4) and neocortical (Figure 5C4) spheroids when differ-
entiated in 20% FBS.
Although a high serum concentration is optimal for type 2
astrocyte differentiation, serum is toxic for neurons in vitro.
Therefore, to verify that a single spheroid could produce
neurons, oligodendrocytes, type 1 astrocytes and type 2 as-
trocytes we lowered the concentration of serum to 0.5%
FBS and supplemented the medium with 10 ng/ml BMP-4, to
simultaneously promote neuron differentiation and type 2
astrocyte production. These culture conditions permitted a
single spheroid to produce all four cell types (Figure 5D).
In fact, the majority of spheroids from the neonatal SVZ
were capable of producing neurons (Figure 5D1), type 1 (Fig-
ure 5D2) and type 2 astrocytes (Figure 5D3), and oligodendro-
cytes (Figure 5D4). By contrast, although spheroids could be
generated from the neonatal neocortex, neurons were rarely
produced from neocortical spheroids.
Whereas the spheroids produced neurons, astrocytes and
oligodendrocytes, these spheroids might be comprised of
lineage-restricted progenitors, with separate precursors for
astrocytes and others for oligodendrocytes or neurons, or
they might be comprised of multipotential progenitors that
could give rise to all cell types. To characterize the differenti-
ation potential of individual progenitors we used replication-
deficient retroviruses and infected a limited number of cells.
The fates of cells derived from single precursors were then
analyzed after 5 days of differentiation (Figure 6). A colony
was defined as GFP + cells that were at least 150 m from
another cluster. This technique has been previously estab-
lished to define single clones while avoiding the overlap-
ping of two separate clones (Levison and Goldman, 1993,

both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In a follow-up ex-

ing in the B104 CM, a strikingly similar outcome was ob-
tained. Out of a total of 117 counted colonies, 65% were

PDGF-responsive SVZ progenitors
Figure 5 Spheroids from the neonatal SVZ and neocortex generate colonies that contain neurons, type 1 astrocytes, type 2 astrocytes
and oligodendrocytes
Spheroids were cultured with 10 ng/ml PDGF-AA, differentiated for 3 days in either 0.5% FBS or 20% FBS then stained for oligo-
dendrocytes (Rmab) (A1, B1, C1), O-2A lineage (A2B5) (A2, B2, C2), and astrocytes (GFAP) (A3, B3, C3). The pseudocolor images
show an overlay of Rmab (magenta), A2B5 (green), GFAP (red), and DAPI (blue) (A4, B4, C4). When differentiated in 0.5% FBS and
10 ng/ml BMP-4, a single spheroid produced neurons (TUJ1), type 1 astrocytes (A2B5 - /GFAP + ), type 2 astrocytes (A2B5 + /GFAP + )
and oligodendrocytes (Rmab) (D). Examples of the four cell types from a single spheroid neuron (D1), type 1 astrocyte (D2), type 2

TUJI + /GFP + neurons were not observed in either experi-
ment, even though TUJI + /GFP - neurons were present in
the cultures.
Since specific types of neurons are known to silence retro-
viral vector reporter gene expression (Gaiano et al., 1999), it is
possible that neurons produced from a PRP may have silenced
GFP expression and thus eluded detection. Therefore, we used
a co-culture system where SVZ cells were isolated from the
SVZs of P3 transgenic GFP + neonates and their GFP - litter-
mates, and then mixed whereupon the GFP + cells comprised
a small proportion of the total. Single cells were suspended
at ratios of 1:150, 1:75, 1:30, and 1:15 (GFP + /GFP - ) and
cultured in 50% conditioned media. After 8 DIV, spheroids
containing a mixture of GFP + and GFP - cells were fre-
quently observed (Figure 7A); however, small spheroids com-
prised uniformly of GFP + cells were also observed. Spheroids
were scored as GFP + if they contained at least five or more
GFP + cells, even if some of the cells in the spheroid were
GFP - (Figure 7C).
Since many of the spheroids contained GFP + and non-
GFP + cells, that may have formed by PRP adhesion or
spheroid fusion, we performed a statistical analysis using the
hypergeometric probability model to determine the proba-
bility that the GFP + cells within a spheroid were descended
from a single progenitor (Ross, 2010). Given the number of
GFP + to GFP - cells we initially plated (3×103 GFP + to
4.5×105 GFP - ) and the generation of 112 spheroids, of
which 11 were GFP + (containing at least five GFP + cells),
it was possible to compute the probability that a single GFP +
PRP formed a cluster of GFP + cells within the spheroid. The
model concluded that for there to be a greater than 5%
chance that more than two GFP + PRPs are giving rise to
daughter cells in a single spheroid, the number k of spheroid
forming cells within a single spheroid would have to exceed
15 parent cells. Although k is unknown, k exceeding 15 is
highly unlikely based on our limited dilution assay where
the percentage r of spheroid-forming cells is approximately
1% (Figure 8B). Therefore, we can conclude that in our low-
est plating density of GFP + cells (1:150) there were 30
GFP + PRPs (r = 1% of 3×103) that were spheroid forming.
These 30 GFP + PRPs comprised a mosaic of over 4.5×105
cells where the vast majority were GFP - . Thus, the likelihood
of two or more GFP + PRPs adhering to each other in these
culture conditions are highly improbable and, therefore, we
can report with almost certainty that each GFP + cluster
originated from one GFP + cell.
To assess the developmental potentials of these PRPs, all
of the spheroids from the lowest initial plating density of
GFP + cells were plated on to PDL and laminin-coated cham-
ber slides and differentiated in the absence of growth fac-
tors or serum for 5 days. Clusters of GFP + cells that were
widely separated from each other were stained for TUJ1 (Fig-
ure 7B2), O4 (Figure 7B3), and GFAP (Figure 7B4). We counted
90 colonies and found that 51% of the clones were astrocyte-
generating, 21% were oligodendrocyte-generating, 3% were
neuron-generating, 17% were bipotential astrocyte and
oligodendrocyte generating, and 3% were bipotential as-
trocyte and neuron generating. None produced oligoden-
drocytes and neurons and 4% were tripotential generating
astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons (Figure 7D).

Jackson et al. (2006) suggested that some PDGFR +
cells in the adult SVZ were stem cells. Therefore, to deter-
mine whether the spheroids were formed by stem cells we
tested their self-renewal capability (Figure 8). To determine
the number of cells within a sphere that were self-renewing
and capable of giving rise to subsequent spheres we used the
limiting dilution assay. Using informative serial dilutions we
determined the ratio of sphere-forming cells within spheroid
and neurosphere cultures. To graphically represent the Pois-
son distribution, we generated a graph with the semi-log plot
of the negative logarithm of the fraction of negative wells
as compared to cell plating density (Figure 8A). The Poisson
distribution line intercepts x at the reciprocal negative loga-
rithm 1/e or 37% and defines  = 1, which is linearly pro-
portional to the mean number of sphere-forming cells. This
analysis showed that the cells of the neurosphere that were
capable of forming new neurospheres was 1 in 800 as com-
pared to the PRPs which was 1 in >1000 cells. Next we grew
the cells as bulk cultures and analyzed self-renewal across se-
rial passages (Figure 8B). Across the first two passages there
was an amplification of cells that formed spheroids. Approxi-
mately 1% of the total cell population directly isolated from
the neonatal SVZ formed spheroids whereas 4.3% of the cells
in the 2nd passage formed secondary spheroids. However,
from passage 3 through passage 4 (tertiary to quaternary) the
percentage of self-renewing cells within the spheroids plum-
meted. Cells able to form tertiary spheroids generated in the
3rd passage declined to 3.5% of the total cell population and
at the 4th passage less than 0.1% of the total cell population
formed spheroids. By contrast, cells that formed neurospheres

(B4). Spheroids that contained 5 GFP + cells, by fluorescence imaging followed by ImageJ analysis, were counted as a GFP +

directly from the neonatal SVZ represented 0.7% of the total
cell population, which increased to approximately 3% at the
2nd passage and then was maintained. Furthermore, primary
neurospheres and spheroids were morphological dissimilar.
Prior to the 1st passage the neurospheres (Figure 8B1) were
more circular than the spheroids (Figure 8B2). Secondary neu-
rospheres (Figure 8B3) and spheroids (Figure 8B4) were more
similar. After three serial passages, the neurospheres consis-
tently formed new symmetrical spheres (Figure 8B5), whereas
the spheroids were extremely small and irregularly shaped
(Figure 8B6). Progenitors exist outside the SVZ that can gen-
erate new glial cells (and neurons under non-physiological
conditions) throughout adulthood; therefore, we evaluated
the capacity of neocortical progenitors to generate spheroids
and assessed their potentiality (Figure 9). Single-cell suspen-
sions from neonatal and adult neocortices were grown in
B104 CM. The neonatal neocortical cells (Figures 9A1 and
9A2) formed spheroids by 7 days while the adult neocorti-
cal cells (Figures 9B1 and 9B2) required twice the amount
of time to produce spheroids. Surprisingly, progenitors in
the adult neocortex only produced spheroids when the cells
were grown in 2% O2
, unlike the neonatal cells that grew
well in more highly oxygenated medium. The cells from the
adult brain also required a higher plating density to produce
spheroids (3×105 cells/ml). Next we compared the differ-
entiation potentialities of neocortical versus SVZ PRPs from
both neonates and adults. The differentiation patterns of the
SVZ cells observed from the adult brain were not very dif-
ferent from the neonatal brain. Moreover, spheroids from
the adult and neonatal neocortices produced both O4 +

9C2). By contrast progenitors isolated from the adult neocor-
tex did not produce neurons. Finally, we assessed the relative
numbers of PRPs present across the lifespan. With age the
number of spheroids produced from the neocortex decreased
(Figure 9D). By contrast, the capacity of the SVZ to produce
spheroids was maintained.
DISCUSSION
The SVZ is a germinal matrix that contains NSCs and progeni-
tors of various potentialities. These stem and progenitor cells
are present in the brain throughout adult life. Evidence has
emerged to suggest that a PDGFR + precursor, with similar
potentiality to the NSCs, also resides in this niche (Jackson
et al., 2006). Whereas previous studies on the PDGFR +
cells of the brain have focused on their roles in gliogenesis
(Richardson et al., 1988; McKinnon et al., 2005), recent in vivo
studies of the PRPs in the embryo and adult have implicated
them in neurogenesis (Chojnacki and Weiss, 2004; Chojnacki
et al., 2008; Rivers et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2010). The aim
of this study was to establish a well defined in vitro culture
system to study the PRPs of the postnatal SVZ, to determine
whether the postnatal PRPs are stem cells or progenitors, to
assay whether they are a homogeneous or heterogeneous
population and to evaluate their relative abundance across
the lifespan.
PDGF-AA is a growth factor that signals through PDGFR
to stimulate cell proliferation and to also promote cell sur-
vival (Barres et al., 1992; McKinnon et al., 2005). We modified
the well-established neurosphere procedure to amplify the
PRPs of the postnatal SVZ. By culturing isolated SVZ cells in
media supplemented with PDGF-AA we obtained colonies of
nonadherent cells that grew as clusters. We refer to these

Spheroids were generated from P5 neocortex (A1), P5 SVZ (A2), P70 neocortex (B1) and P70 SVZ (B2). Neonatal cells were grown for
7 days while the adult cells where grown for 16 days in 2% O2

5 days then stained for oligodendrocyte (O4-green) and astrocyte (GFAP-red) markers (C1, C2). The average number of spheroids from

clusters as spheroids to distinguish them from neurospheres
formed in EGF/FGF-2 supplemented media. Morphologically,
primary spheroids have an asymmetric appearance versus
primary neurospheres that grow as tight symmetric spheres.
Since PDGFR is known to be associated with glial dif-
ferentiation it seemed likely that the SVZ cells that were
PDGF-AA-responsive would only produce glial progeny (Hill
et al., 2013). However, we found that PRPs of the SVZ
were not only a prominent source for forebrain macroglia,
giving rise to oligodendrocytes and two types of astro-
cytes, but that they also produced neurons. Neurons are
not traditionally thought to develop from PDGFR + pre-
cursors. Rather, they have been shown to develop from
EGFR + or FGFR + precursors of the VZ and SVZ. How-
ever, our experiments clearly demonstrate that PDGFR +
SVZ cells can give rise to immature neurons at least un-
til postnatal day 12. Using FACS, we have recently estab-
lished that Lex + /CD133 - /NG2 + /PDGFR + cells sorted
from the neonatal SVZ and from neurospheres are capable of
differentiating into A2B5 - /GD3 - /GFAP + polygonal as-
trocytes, A2B5 - /GD3 + /GFAP + radial glial-like astrocytes,
TuJ1 + immature neurons and O4 + oligodendrocytes when
cultured in the presence of PDGF-AA. Thus quatropotential
progenitors also exist in the mouse SVZ (Buono et al., 2012).
Moreover, our studies on the composition of the mouse SVZ
confirmed that the multipotential PRPs are lost as the brain
matures (Buono et al., 2012). Other laboratories have used
transgenic animals and traced the fates of NG2 + /PDGFR +
cells throughout the adult CNS and discovered that these
cells are capable of giving rise to new projection neurons
in the ventral forebrain and in the piriform cortex (Rivers
et al., 2008). More specifically NG2 + /PDGFR + cells have
been shown to differentiate into functional pyramidal glu-
tamatergic neurons in the piriform cortex (Guo et al., 2010).
Like the SVZ, spheroids produced multiple cell types as
assessed using a panel of markers that identified immature
oligodendrocytes, type 1 astrocytes, type 2 astrocytes and
neurons. Surprisingly a majority of spheroids analyzed in
the B104 CM and PDGF-AA supplemented media produced
spheroids that were capable of generating oligodendrocytes,
astrocytes and neurons at the same ratio as the neurospheres.
We initially hypothesized that our culture conditions would
be optimal for growing glial lineage restricted progenitors
but our results contradicted that hypothesis. Not only were

these PRPs tripotential, making neurons, type 1 astrocytes
and oligodendrocytes, but they were also capable of gen-
erating type 2 astrocytes. An important conclusion of our
studies is that there is a unique, quatropotential progenitor
within the SVZ.
Despite multiple attempts, we were unable to culture sin-
gle PRPs to study their differentiation potentials. Therefore,
to study single PRPs we used replication-incompetent retro-
viral fate mapping. In these studies, over 96% of the virally
infected colonies contained identifiable glial cells. The ma-
jority of the colonies (65%) only generated astrocytes and
20% contained only oligodendrocytes. A third subset, ap-
proximately 10% of the progenitors, produced both oligo-
dendrocytes and protoplasmic astrocytes. A small fraction of
the infected cells (3­4%) did not stain for either GFAP or
O4. These clones were likely comprised of progenitors that
had not yet acquired lineage-restricted markers. Clusters of
neurons and glia were not observed.
Since subsets of neurons, and striatal neurons in particu-
lar, can silence retroviral promoters (Gaiano et al., 1999), we
performed fate-mapping studies using mixtures of GFP +
and GFP - PRPs. At the ratio analyzed for these studies,
GFP + cells comprised only 0.6% of the total population, en-
abling us to assess clonality. Many of the resulting spheroids
were a mixture of GFP + and GFP - cells, which is con-
sistent with previous studies that showed that precursors
can adhere to each other to form spheres and that smaller
spheres can aggregate and eventually fuse to become a single
larger sphere (Ladiwala et al., 2012). While spheroid fusion
can complicate clonal analyses, the results of the hyperge-
ometric probability model, using parameters matching our
experimental setup, indicate that there is a less than 5%
probability that two or more GFP + cells contributed to a
single spheroid even when 15 cells contributed to the for-
mation of a spheroid. Our limited dilution studies indicate
that this overestimates the number of spheroid forming cells,
thus the probability that two or more GFP + cells formed a
spheroid is even less.
In the PRP mixing experiments, 51% of the colonies
were astrocyte-generating, 21% were oligodendrocyte-
generating, 3% were neuron-generating, 17% were bipo-
tential astrocyte and oligodendrocyte-generating, 3% were
bipotential astrocyte and neuron-generating, none produced
oligodendrocytes and neurons and 4% were tripotential,
generating astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. Thus,
using two different approaches for lineage analyses, we have
determined that the PRPs are very heterogeneous with unipo-
tential, bipotential, tripotential and presumably quatropo-
tential progenitors capable of generating oligodendrocytes
and two types of astrocytes, as well as a subset of neurons.
Moreover, our results show that the PRPs of the SVZ re-
tain their proliferative and multi-potentiality into adulthood
whereas PRPs in the neocortex become depleted and lineage
restricted. The adult neocortical spheroids did not produce
neurons, unlike the spheroids from the neonatal neocortex.
This suggests that the PRPs in the adult neocortex, although
capable of proliferating, are glial lineage restricted and thus
different from the PRPs of the neonate. There is a contro-
versy over whether some NSCs are PDGFR + (Jackson et al.,
2006; Chojnacki et al., 2011). We show that the neurospheres
and the spheroids have similar differentiation potentials but
the PRPs have limited self-renewal capacity. After four serial
passages, the neurosphere-forming cells retained their ability
to form subsequent spheres, however, the spheroid-forming
cells after repeated passages became depleted. Previous stud-
ies on mouse PRPs found that these cells could be passaged
when FGF-2 was added to the media (Chojnacki and Weiss,
2004). However, given that other studies have shown that
FGF-2 de-differentiates cells in vitro we did not add FGF-2 to
our medium (Kondo and Raff, 2000). Moreover, in our exper-
iments, rat PRPs could be grown as spheroids and passaged
without FGF-2 for up to three generations. Therefore, PRPs,
and even the quatropotential PRPs, appear to have a limited
self-renewal capacity and, therefore, by definition are not
stem cells. These data confirm and extend the work of Choj-
nacki and colleagues (Chojnacki and Weiss, 2004; Chojnacki
et al., 2011).
Spheroids formed at low plating densities, supporting the
view that a spheroid can be derived from a single PDGF-
AA responsive precursor. However, the spheroids grew more
robustly at high densities, and providing conditioned me-
dia from high density spheroid cultures restored the growth
potential of the low density plated cells. These observations
suggest that these PRPs secrete factors that exert autocrine
and/or paracrine signaling effects. Although the exact mech-
anism is unknown, it has been suggested that growth factor-
dependent SHH (sonic hedgehog) signaling promotes sur-
vival, growth and/or self-renewal of PRPs (Chojnacki and
Weiss, 2004). When PRPs were grown in the presence of
cyclopamine, an inhibitor of SHH signaling, colony size and
number were reduced. Conversely, when the PRPs were grown
in the presence of SHH their numbers increased. These data
suggest that SHH is promoting the ability of PRPs to produce
spheroids.
The detection of increased levels of phosphorylated ERK-
1 and 2 after PDGF-AA stimulation provides direct evidence
that these cells express functional PDGF receptors. Although
spheroids that were constantly grown in PDGF-AA did express
low levels of the PDGF receptors, they responded poorly to
PDGF stimulation with no significant change in downstream
targets molecules (data not shown). Since it has been well es-
tablished that cells down-regulate growth factor receptors in
the constant presence of growth factors, we removed the in-
sulin and PDGF-AA in the medium for 6 h prior to stimulating
the cells with PDGF-AA and collecting protein for Western
blot analyses. Using this modified culture paradigm we were
able to detect both PDGFR and PDGFR and demonstrated
that ERK-1 and 2 phosphorylation increased upon PDGF stim-
ulation.
Despite the fact that the majority of cells within the
spheroids were PSA-NCAM + , the spheroids were clearly
comprised of a mixed population of cells that expressed

PDGF-responsive SVZ progenitors
markers of both restricted and unrestricted progenitors. Sev-
eral markers of tripotential progenitors, such as PSA-NCAM
(Grinspan and Franceschini, 1995; Ben-Hur et al., 1998), Dlx2
(Marshall and Goldman, 2002), Olig2 (Marshall et al., 2005)
and NG2 (Nishiyama et al., 1996; Aguirre et al., 2004) were
expressed by a large percentage of the cells. Almost 35%
of the cells also expressed nestin, which is commonly as-
sociated with stem cells and early progenitors in the CNS
(Dahlstrand et al., 1995; Kawaguchi et al., 2001; Beech et al.,
2004; Mignone et al., 2004). Vimentin, another intermediate
filament, which is expressed by immature astrocytes and glial
progenitors was also present, but in a smaller subset of cells.
Furthermore, 20% of the cells were A2B5 + , which is often
used as a marker for glial-restricted precursors, but which was
originally described as a neuronal maker (Eisenbarth et al.,
1979; Rao and Mayer-Proschel, 1997; Scolding et al., 1999).
GFAP was found in 20% of the cells. Ganglioside GD3 and
acetylated ganglioside GD3, both of which have been well
established to be enriched on SVZ and cerebral progenitors
(Levine et al., 1984; LeVine and Goldman, 1988) were present
in a small percentage of the cells. This was unexpected given
that GD3 is highly expressed in the in vivo neonatal SVZ.
Since an in vitro culture system has not been well es-
tablished to grow PRPs of the postnatal SVZ, we evaluated
combinations of B104 CM and PDGF-AA +
- noggin, as these
growth supplements have been used to propagate neural pre-
cursors (Noble et al., 1988; Grinspan et al., 1990b; Gard and
Pfeiffer, 1993; Grinspan and Franceschini, 1995; Avellana-
Adalid et al., 1996; Nishiyama et al., 1996; Seidman et al.,
1997; Zhang et al., 1998; Vitry et al., 1999; Lim et al., 2000;
Kondo and Raff, 2004; Izrael et al., 2007). We found that
these culture media formulations all generated 80% PSA-
NCAM + cells, where PSA-NCAM is a marker established to be
expressed by both precursors capable of producing neurons,
astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. There was no significance
between the individual conditions. These in vitro results sup-
port previous in vivo studies of postnatal SVZ-derived precur-
sors, where 80% expressed PSA-NCAM (Levison and Gold-
man, 1997). Spheroids produced in medium supplemented
to 30% B104 CM generated the most equivalent balance
between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, while maintain-
ing the highest percentage of GFAP - /O4 - cells, which are
likely non-lineage-restricted progenitors.
Spheroids grew larger when maintained in 2% O2
versus
20% O2
. This observation is analogous to previous studies
that showed that O2
tension is a critical determinant in NSC
propagation (Chen et al., 2007; Pistollato et al., 2007; Le Belle
et al., 2011). These studies also showed that growth in 5% O2
expanded nestin + /CD133 + /CD24 + precursors that read-
ily differentiated into all three neural lineages, whereas neu-
ral precursors maintained in 20% O2
preferentially generated
astrocytes regardless of the presence of other mitogens (Chen
et al., 2007; Pistollato et al., 2007). They also found that in-
creases in O2
tension promoted oligodendrocyte maturation,
which is similar to our findings. However, we did not observe
the ratio of oligodendrocytes to astrocytes being affected
by the concentration of O2
, likely because our studies were
performed on rat progenitors which are less sensitive to O2
than either mouse or human neural precursors (Chen et al.,
2007; Pistollato et al., 2007).
Adult PRPs have been postulated to be tumor-initiating
cells in the adult neocortex since they are slowly dividing cells
that can produce both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and
persist across the lifespan (Assanah et al., 2009). Although
gliomas are known to start from a single transformed cell
and they are most frequently found in the adult neocortex,
our data suggest that some tumor-initiating cells might also
reside within the SVZ; however, were one of the SVZ PRPs to
become transformed, it would more likely form a primitive
neuroectodermal tumor rather than a glioma.
