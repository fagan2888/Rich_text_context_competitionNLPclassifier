Introduction
Youthful age is desired by most adults in today's society, and
a number of studies have shown that adults in general deny
their chronological age, claim to be younger than they are,
and see aging negatively (Barak, Mathur, Lee, & Zhang,
2001; Goldsmith & Heiens, 1992; Kastenbaum, Derbin,
Sabatini, & Artt, 1972; Montepare & Lachman, 1989; Oberg
& Tornstam, 2001; Peters, 1971; Rubin & Berntsen, 2006;
Stephan, Caudroit, & Chalabaev, 2011; Ward, 1977; Wilkes,
1992). Furthermore, it is generally claimed that most adults
want to remain young and claim to be younger than their
biological age and, in particular, see younger years (18-39
years) as the golden years (Rubin & Berntsen, 2006; Stephan
et al., 2011). Therefore, the question of why this discrepancy
exists in terms of life span of adults wanting to be younger
needs to be explored. One way to account for this discrep-
ancy is to explore perceptions around aging within a homo-
geneous group of adults (i.e., pre-service teachers) with a
shared common experience, to provide a qualified, holistic
explanation. Thus, exploring how pre-service teachers per-
ceive their own age may provide insights into how they come
to document or record their own aging process in terms of
their own life trajectory (Henderson, Goldsmith, & Flynnm,
1995). The present study will fill a gap in the literature in
terms of how adult pre-service teachers come to perceive
their own aging. Knowing how pre-service teachers perceive
their own aging will provide insight into the discrepancy of
why adults want to appear younger than they are
biologically.
This notion of wanting to remain young is neither a new
nor novel concept, as it stretches back to age old cultures,
mythologies, and legends, where individuals over time have
grappled to live longer and younger, and defy the aging pro-
cess (Eibach, Mock, & Courtney, 2010). A biological under-
standing of aging argues that aging is an inevitable biological
construct that not only involves physical and psychological
change but can also neither be turned back nor stopped
(Eibach et al., 2010; Peterson, 2010). In addition, significant
investment has been made into scientific research to find
ways for people to defy the very process of aging (Couteur &
Sinclair, 2010; Langer, 2010). For example, advances in bio-
gerontology have led to the discovery of a molecule called
Resveratrol, which when consumed claims to improve health
and increase longevity; however, while this has not been
adequately tested on human beings, many individuals seem
to be using this drug to defy aging (Baur et al., 2006).
Furthermore, the use of antioxidants to delay aging has not
been found to be an effective defense against aging either
(Couteur & Sinclair). To this end, medical science or bio-
gerontology, while trying to address the issue of longevity,
still appears to have no conclusive answers to preventing
aging. Therefore, the answer may not lie in medicine, and
given this, perhaps it is better to address aging from an "atti-
tude" point of view in terms of a developmental trajectory
perspective around aging, subjective experience, and percep-
tions of aging in general (Langer, 2010; Stephan et al., 2011).
For this article, the life span is divided into the following
stages: infancy, early childhood, middle childhood,

Pre-Service Teachers' Perception of Age
Through a Developmental Lens
J-F1, K. Swabey1, and D. Pullen1
Abstract
The present study examined the perception of aging among a cohort of pre-service teachers undertaking an undergraduate
degree in primary school education. Using a self-reported questionnaire adapted from the work of Rubin and Berntsen, 331
undergraduate students were asked a series of questions relating to their perceptions of aging. It was concluded that younger
pre-service teachers held a more positive perception of aging than older pre-service teachers. Younger pre-service teachers
seemed to display a greater level of optimism toward future life experiences, eager to explore their world and make new
relationships, than were older aged students.

adolescence, early adulthood (18-39 years), adulthood
(midlife, from around 40 to 49 years), later adulthood (50-65
years), and old age (65+ years; Peterson, 2010). From this
perspective, it is likely that in adolescence and early adult-
hood, most people claim to feel older than their chronologi-
cal age, while in midlife, that is, adulthood, they tend to feel
younger than their chronological age (Eibach et al., 2010;
Montepare & Lachman, 1989). It is also claimed that adults
above the age of 40 report feeling 20% younger; it is further
asserted that the process of discrepancy between actual age
and ideal age increases with chronological age (Barak et al.,
2001). To this end, a great majority of adults (40+ years) per-
ceive younger age (18-39 years) to be far more exciting, fun,
and enjoyable and view aging as a barrier to their quality of
life (Farney, Aday, & Breault, 2006; Foos & Clark, 2011;
Rubin & Berntsen, 2006). Montepare and Lachman (1989)
supported the above by noting that older adults are not only
likely to deny their actual age but also see themselves as
younger than they are. Monk and Eibach (2011) argued that
how a person feels about his or her own age is an important
phenomenological concept as it "determines whether people
take into account their aging attitudes when evaluating their
own lives" (p. 979); thus, exploring how adults perceive and
come to see their own age can provide insights into the dis-
crepancy between how they feel about their own age, their
actual age, and the aging process in general.
Perhaps then, subjective experience in terms of attitudes
show how one comes to process his or her own aging, it may
be necessary to consider this as a prelude to explaining the
discrepancy of wanting to be younger. Monk and Eibach
(2011), in a 10-year longitudinal study, found that when indi-
viduals have unfavorable aging attitudes, they are likely to
experience negative outcomes in their aging. Data were col-
lected at two different time periods: Wave 1 initial surveys
(n = more than 7,000) were collected by MacArthur Midlife
Research Network between 1994 and 1995, and the Wave 2
set of data was collected by the Institute on Aging at the
University of Wisconsin­Madison between 2004 and 2006.
The second survey contained more than 70% of the partici-
pants from the original sample. Aging attitudes and life satis-
faction questions were posed through a questionnaire, and
this measured positive and negative attitudes about the aging
process. Subjective age was measured through the difference
between reported chronological age and the age participants
reported feeling. Monk and Eibach found that participants in
Wave 1 (86%) and Wave 2 (83%) reported feeling younger
than their chronological age. In terms of positive affect, it
was found that better perceived health around aging led to
positive affect, and negative perceived health led to negative
affect among participants. Based on this finding, Monk and
Eibach claimed that subjective age and well-being are depen-
dent on a person's attitude toward aging. However, equally,
how one quantifies and measures subjective age, well-being,
and attitudes likely vacillates the findings; hence, consider-
ation must be given to how one comes to experience his or
her own aging beyond a later positive and negative affect.
To understand aging, Rubin and Berntsen (2006) closely
examined three questions: What is the distribution of subjec-
tive age over life span? Does it support the age denial life-
span-developmental view? and Are there discrepancies in
age denial in early adulthood? All of the participants (N =
1,470; with ages ranging from 20 to 97) were from Denmark.
There was a 58% response rate to the surveys. All of the
questions in the survey were concerned with how one felt
about his or her age (e.g., How old do you feel inside?).
Results showed that age discrepancy among participants
grew exponentially as participants got older until the age of
40, after which there was no significant change. Furthermore,
younger participants (up to age 25) reported feeling older
than their chronological age, meaning that they were more
favorable toward aging. However, 70% participants above
the age of 39 reported that they felt younger, while 27%
reported they felt exactly the same as their age, and only 2%
reported feeling older than their age. Overall, this study
found that participants reported that they felt 20% younger
than their actual age, and this was more predominant in par-
ticipants in their 40s and above.
In terms of perceptions around aging, Montepare and
Lachman (1989), using a life-span-developmental frame-
work, explained this discrepancy between actual age, ideal
age, and felt age by noting that "the tendency of aging adults
to maintain younger subjective age identities is a form of
defensive denial by which they can dissociate themselves
from the stigma attached to growing old" (p. 73). Langer
(2010) argued that how one perceived his or her age influ-
enced his or her quality of life, life satisfaction, and how one
comes to age. Langer found that there was an increase in
quality of life, health, and longevity among elderly when
they were encouraged to re-think how they viewed aging,
such that those who were able to perceive their aging posi-
tively became healthier and more active. Stephan et al.
(2011), in support of Langer (2012), noted that younger or
youthful subjective age (e.g., the sense of feeling younger
than one's own age) leads to greater life satisfaction and per-
haps even longevity.
Montepare and Lachman (1989) explored self-percep-
tions of age from adolescence to old age alongside life satis-
faction among individuals living in Boston (N = 187; 81
males and 106 females, age range 14-78). All participants
completed a survey that related to how old they felt in terms
of their looks, actions, behaviors, and current life satisfac-
tion. Participants were also invited to answer questions about
their fears, apprehensions about their own age, and the aging
process. Results showed that younger (i.e., 20 years) partici-
pants had a more positive outlook on age as they embraced
older age identities. Middle-aged (40 years) and older
(60 years) participants saw themselves younger than their
actual age. Older participants not only rejected their own age
identities but viewed aging with reluctance by not positively
welcome aging. In terms of gender difference, older woman,
although they reported younger age identities, reported less
life satisfaction. However, with older men, life satisfaction
J-F et al. 3
was independent of their age. Importantly, Montepare and
Lachman (1989) found that younger people not only enjoyed
their actual age but also appeared to want to grow older and
looked forward to aging with greater optimism. Could these
findings be similar for pre-service teachers, where younger
pre-service teachers look forward to aging?
Another explanation as to why individuals want to remain
young could be due to the prevailing societal stereotypes,
views, and attitudes that portray being young as more allur-
ing and desirable and equally that old age brings far more
difficulties and challenges to everyday life (Eibach et al.,
2010; Peterson, 2010). Holladay (2002) supported the above
by noting that the discrepancies between actual age, felt age,
and ideal age are due to the regular "exposure [of] elderly
[on] television, television commercials, movies and print ads
. . . [that] heighten. . . awareness of problems of aging, rang-
ing from cognitive difficulties to financial insecurity"
(p. 681). It also appears that popular media not only upholds
negative stereotypes about aging and enforces them as reali-
ties for everyone but also promotes adults to be younger
(Holladay, 2002). In addition, although the media presents a
few positive messages of aging, the overall message is nega-
tive: Older adults are perceived negatively and are more
salient within everyday media (Horton, Baker, Cote, &
Deakin, 2008). Such views may be influenced by negative
stereotypes and perceptions of older adults as less active, not
capable of everyday activities, and dependent on others
(Farney et al., 2006; Palmore, 1980). Williams, Nowak, and
Scobee (2006) believed that misconceptions about the pro-
cess of aging could be attributed to minimal social encoun-
ters across ages.
Negative portrayal of older people is likely to lead to indi-
viduals denying their actual age so that they are not labeled
dependent and needful (Farney et al., 2006; Foos & Clark,
2011). Recognizing this, Holladay (2002) noted that popular
media shapes and maintains our views, as well as cultivates
our "conceptions of what later life might hold for aging indi-
viduals" (p. 681). Thus, it is important to know whether and
to what extent these stereotypes and/or popular media come
to influence a person's perception of his or her own age,
especially among pre-service teachers, in an effort to find out
to what extent they adhere to such stereotypes. One way to
address negative stereotypes in society is to expose individu-
als to facts and real-life experiences about aging. Gorelik,
Damron-Rodriguez, Funderburk, and Solomon (2000) stud-
ied undergraduates' (n = 189) interest in aging by comparing
them with a random comparison group (n = 261). All partici-
pants completed a survey on aging interest and found that
regular contact with older adults and engaging in aging
courses positively influenced undergraduate students to view
aging more positively. Gorelik et al. argued that regular
exposure to gerontology content and regular contact with the
elderly were likely to influence students to view old age
positively.
Similarly, Van Dussen and Weaver (2009) conducted a
study using university students (n = 552) to understand stu-
dent attitudes toward older people and gerontology educa-
tion in general. They found that students with greater contact
with older adults had a more positive outlook on aging and
the elderly. Over the past few decades, much of the interest
in aging studies has been influenced by knowledge around
aged care and support for the elderly (e.g., 65+), and little
focus has been given on how pre-service teachers view or
perceive their own age and what meanings and values they
attach to their own age. Several studies have been under-
taken in the area of gerontology, in terms of women studies
and facial decoding of older people, but very few studies
have looked at how pre-service teachers, both male and
female, perceive themselves in terms of their own age
(Gorelik et al., 2000; Van Dussen & Weaver, 2009).
While a number of studies have focused on aging, no
study has actually documented real-life accounts of pre-
service teachers around their views of aging. The reason for
choosing pre-service teachers was to not only capture their
perceptions about aging but also because to date no study has
documented their experiences and importantly it will assist
in their overall assessment of their own aging process as they
begin to work school students. Based on the premise of "at
what age does the young, middle-aged, and the elderly feel
. . . too old" (Farney et al., 2006, p. 215), the present study
aimed to capture how pre-service teachers come to experi-
ence their own age and aging process
Method
Pre-service teachers at a university in Tasmania enrolled in a
human development unit were invited to participate in the
study. Although sampling occurred mainly on the basis of
convenience, care was taken to ensure that participation was
voluntary without any academic credit, incentives, or mone-
tary reward. Furthermore, no identifiable information was
collected from participants. Information and consent for the
study were presented to students online through the units
online home page using Blackboard.
Instrument
Pre-service teachers were invited to complete a question-
naire constructed to capture perceptions of age adapted from
the work of Rubin and Berntsen (2006). This questionnaire
had eight questions: Three were demographic (e.g., age, gen-
der, and ethnicity), three were forced responses related to
perception of age (with a provision to make qualitative
descriptions for their response), and two were qualitative
questions directed at determining what factors influence
one's perception of one's own age. Furthermore, the ques-
tionnaire was used to collect preliminary demographic infor-
mation (age, gender, and ethnicity) and information relating
4 SAGE Open
to perceptions of age. Questions relating to age were pre-
sented in multiple-choice format (e.g., Are you happy with
your age?--yes, no, or neither) with the provision of open-
ended responses to describe the reason for the participants'
response/choice.
Participants
All participants (N = 331) were pre-service teachers enrolled
in a first-year pre-requisite unit on human development at a
university in Tasmania. The majority of participants were
female (76%), and the age range of participants was from 18
to 56 (M = 26 years); 73% were below the age of 30 and just
more than 50% of the participants below the age of 20.
Design
This study used a survey design. Overall, this activity took
approximately 5 min for participants to complete. The sur-
vey questionnaire was completed online through Blackboard
as part of a weekly learning activity within the unit.
Method of Analysis
Given that the focus of the study was mainly qualitative, data
analysis aimed to explore and identify broad and unique
themes from within the data. Data from Blackboard were
exported to an Excel spreadsheet, each row of the Excel
spreadsheet clearly showing each participant's response,
respectively, against his or her demographic information
(e.g., age, gender, etc.). The three forced responses related to
perception of age were used to assess overall percentages of
responses in terms of yes or no, and quantitative data around
demographic details were presented through simple descrip-
tive statistics. All qualitative descriptions were thematically
coded. In this, qualitative data were obtained by comparing
all specific descriptions to develop a common theme, which
was directly validated by the participant's description.
Hence, qualitative analysis occurred on a thematic level to
show how participants perceived their own age.
Results
Each qualitative response in the "Results" section of this
article is followed by the age and gender of the participant;
this is shown in parentheses. Further qualitative responses
are shown in line with main themes. Results are presented for
each question asked.
Q1. Are you happy with your current age? (Actual Age)
A majority (83%) of the participants reported that they
were happy with their current age. Both younger (18-39) and
older (40+) participants reported that they were happy with
their current age.
Younger participants reported a greater sense of cheerful-
ness and independence entering their adulthood years; this is
best summed up by one participant reporting, "I feel I have
many possibilities and opportunities awaiting my life" (F19).
Another participant (F18) reported, ". . .I am young, healthy,
and legal! . . .," and yet another (F18) reported, "I am happy
because as an 18 . . . you can do what you want." Another
participant (M18) said, "I'm enjoying the responsibilities
and freedom associated with adulthood," indicating a sense
of optimism and cheerfulness about his own age. Another
major theme was optimism toward the future. This was best
expressed by a participant (M18) who described an eager-
ness toward future prospects:
I am happy with my age because I have a whole future of
prospects ahead of me such as completing university, getting
married to my fiancée, traveling, becoming a psychologist and
having children. Although it is frightening to be growing up so
quickly I have many things in my future to look forward to.
It also appears that this sense of optimism leading to a
sense of identity was felt by another participant (F18) who
stated, "I am happy with my age as I feel I am at the age
where I am respected as an adult but still can enjoy life as a
kid sometimes."
Older participants reported a sense of contentment, free-
dom, enjoyment, and accomplishment with their current age
as one participant described, "I am happy because I have
some freedom to do what I please, I am old enough to be
taken seriously and I still aspire to do many things before I
die" (F56). Another participant reported,
I am happy because this is where I am, I am starting a new part
of my life and it is fun to experience what is happening in my
life now. I do not wish to be 18-25 because I have been there and
it's not as much fun. It is a hard life struggling to keep a roof
over your head and food on the table . . . life is good now and
full. (F45)
Yet another participant reported, "I have been able to
enjoy lots of different experience . . ." (M47). There was also
a great level of contentment in how participants came to see
their own age; participants appeared not to count their age by
year but in how they came to accept themselves. One partici-
pant stated,
I feel content within myself and comfortable within my own
skin. I am learning new things with the added benefit of life
experience and hindsight. I have overcome conflicts from my
youth and am now free from the anxieties and unhappiness they
used to cause me. I am very happy with the age I am at now and
would not wish to go back in time. (M43)
Q2. Do you feel younger or older? (Felt Age)
Less than half (41%) of the participants reported that they
felt neither older nor younger. More specifically, more than a
J-F et al. 5
quarter (26%) of the participants reported feeling older, and
just over one third (31%) reported feeling younger than their
own age.
Younger participants reported feeling young, and a small
percent reported feeling older; such views seemed to be
intrinsic for some and extrinsic for others with one partici-
pant reporting, "I feel immature for my age [as in I am not]
emotional wise, I feel childish and often stupid. I look physi-
cally younger than my age too, and that doesn't help" (F18).
Equally, some participants claimed that they felt old and
young at the same time with one participant (M19) reporting,
"I do not feel older or younger than my age." Another
reported feeling both:
I feel younger because a lot of people assume I am a lot younger,
thus they treat me like a child. But I have recently felt older too,
because of a fall-out with a friendship group made me realize
how immature they were and how I have different goals and
aspirations to them. I also feel older because I have had to move
out of home to study this course and it has put more responsibility
on me. On the other hand, moving out of home has made me feel
younger too, because I find it very difficult to cope without my
parents. (F18)
However, when participants had responsibilities such as
jobs and family commitments, and were involved in study,
they reported feeling older. One participant reported, "I feel
a little older than my age because I am always so tired with
doing Uni full time and working two jobs along with teach-
ing a martial art. I am too busy feel about 30 years old"
(M20). Another reports, "I feel around 30 I would say it is
most likely that this is because I have had a child and feel the
pressure and responsibility that usually comes with age"
(F20).
Older participants reported that they felt younger than
their chronological age; they claimed to feel younger through
relationships or associations. One participant reported,
My children make me feel younger. I have a close relationship
with them both, very
strong bonds. I remain interested in their lives which keeps me
informed of the changes society is going through and how it
affects them, not just me. My husband is 13 years older than me
(l am 40, he is 53). He has always referred to me as his young
wife, and after 17 years together, he must have conditioned me
to believe this. I try to keep as healthy as I can, my mind as
active as I can, so I don't feel older than 40. I suppose some days
I feel my age, but mostly I feel mid's. (F40)
Another participant reported, "In many ways I still feel
like I did when I married (at 19yrs), or when my children
were young. I am still very much the same person, with a lot
more wisdom and life experience" (F40). In other cases,
although participants recognized biological aging, they still
claimed to be younger either in how they looked, acted, and
behaved or in how they perceived experiences. In relation to
this, one participant reported, "I still feel the same as I did 20
years ago. My body would contradict that as I am not as fit or
active as I used to be" (F50). Another participant reported,
I act younger than my age. I refuse to conform to what a 42-year-
old should wear for example. I am active and have a positive
outlook on life, which makes me feel younger. My kids keep me
young. (F42)
Q3. Do you wish you were younger or older? (Ideal Age)
More than half of the participants (68%) reported wishing
to be neither younger nor older. Around a quarter (25%) of
the participants reported wishing to be younger, while a
small (5%) group reported wanting to be older.
Younger participants (only a small group) reported they
were older in terms of responsibility due to wanting life sta-
bility and maturity. One participant reported,
I wish that I was in my early 20s between 20 and 25 because
then I would no longer be in Uni and I would be old enough to
get married and start having a family. I am very anxious about
how my life will turn out (e.g. who I will marry, where I will
work/live, etc.) so I would like to be a little bit older so that I can
start to think about these things. (F18)
Another reports, "I wish I was 22 years of age, so as I am
not looked upon as young; according to my age rather than
my maturity" (F19). However, a great majority of partici-
pants reported that they did not wish to be younger or older
suggesting that they were comfortable with their current age.
One participant reported, "I do not wish that I were older or
younger than the age I am now" (M19); another reported, "I
am very happy with the age I am at now!" (F18). Yet another
reported,
I feel happy at my current age (18) as it is the first time in my life
where I have gained a sense of independence and no one is
dependent on me (i.e. I have no children to worry about, etc.). I
am looked upon as young, which seems to have nothing but
positive things associated with it, that is, don't have to worry
about the signs of aging. Therefore I am happy with my age.
(M18)
Another participant reported,
I am happy being 32. I do not wish to be younger again, as I
LOVED my teenage/early 20s, but I have no desire to return to
them. I love being a Mum and concentrating on my family time.
I also do not wish to be any older. (F32)
Older participants reported that they were younger and
denied their chronological age: "I wish I was younger,
although I don't look or feel 48, I am not comfortable being
close to 50" (F48). Another participant reported, "I feel
younger, because I don't look 50. I have a young son who
keeps me young" (F50). Others wished they were younger
6 SAGE Open
due to inherent physical benefits, and to this end, one partici-
pant reported, "I'd like to be in my 30s with the physical
energy and looks I had then" (F53). Another participant sim-
ply reported, "younger to be more mobile and fit" (F49). Yet
another reported, "I'd like to be in my 30s with the physical
energy and looks I had then, but the knowledge about life
that I have now" (F53). However, similar to younger partici-
pants, a majority of older participants also did not wish to be
either younger or older suggesting perhaps that they were
comfortable with their age. One participant reported, "I am
happy being the age I am now. I would not want to change it"
(F40). Another participant reported, "I like my age and don't
wish to be younger or older" (F40).
Discussion and Conclusion
A novel aspect of the study is that the findings reported here
are highly consistent with those reported by prior research-
ers, even with a unique pre-service teacher sample from
Tasmania, Australia. The findings of this study revealed that
older participants were positive about aging. Older partici-
pants seemed content with their age and seemed to be more
emotionally positive about their aging while recognizing that
they were aging physically; to this end, older participants
were also quite comfortable with their actual age. One expla-
nation for this could be due to the fact that they were at the
university as students interacting with younger students,
which in turn could have possibly reinforced a sense of
youthfulness. Attaching positive meaning to aging could
have resulted in older participants feeling younger but not
wishing to be younger (i.e., ideal), and this is in line with the
findings of Monk and Eibach (2011). This finding confirmed
Langer's (2010) notion that how one perceives his or her age
influences his or her quality of life and life satisfaction.
Unlike the findings of Rubin and Berntsen (2006), the pres-
ent study found only a very small percentage (5%) of older
students reporting that they felt younger, where they denied
their chronological age. This is in line with Horton et al.
(2008) who noted that older people saw themselves far more
positively in terms of their own aging compared with nega-
tive stereotypes and beliefs about age in society. Furthermore,
it was likely that this group of individuals have conceptual-
ized aging in terms of their relationships, associations (e.g.,
relating to their own children and interacting with students at
university who are far younger than themselves), and activi-
ties they are involved in rather than in terms of their biologi-
cal clock or chronologically.
Younger participants seemed to be positive with all
aspects of their aging; this was in line with the findings of
Montepare and Lachman (1989). Younger participants were
more excited coming to terms with their age and having free-
dom as an adult. Also, given that younger students have
begun their first year at university, this may have further led
them to experience new found freedom, make new friends,
gain independence, and in some cases, experience living
away from home, and, therefore, all these collectives could
have led them to appreciate and anticipate several new expe-
riences leading them to appreciate their actual age. Perhaps
these shared experiences appeared to be far more salient than
other external influences such as media views or societal ste-
reotypes of aging (Farney et al., 2006; Foos & Clark, 2011;
Holladay, 2002).
Overall, the results of the current study found that younger
students were more positive about their actual age than older
students; younger students perceived their age more favor-
ably and with greater optimism than older students. Older
participants were content and positive about their current
age. These findings also underscore several important issues
for future research. First, it would be important to determine
whether the study's domains were restrictive or were robust
across diverse populations. Qualitative studies would allow
more careful exploration of the meaning of specific con-
structs across diverse groups. Second, research is needed to
determine whether specific attributes of aging are missing.
Quite possibly, there are other beliefs about aging that have
not been captured by the published literature. Finally, there is
a need for teacher educators to examine how they teach aging
or life-span development in their courses.
This study provided new and important information about
aging in tertiary students. Using a survey based on the aging
work of Rubin and Berntsen (2006) and the published litera-
ture, the study showed that pre-service teachers' perceptions
of aging did not differ from the published literature concern-
ing the "main stream" population. This indicated that those
entering the teaching profession have attitudes and percep-
tions relating to aging that are consistent with the general
population.
