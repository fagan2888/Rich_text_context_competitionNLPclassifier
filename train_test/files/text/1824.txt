Objective: To describe dietary supplement use among
US children.
Design: Analysis of nationally representative data from
the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES).
Setting: Homeinterviewsandamobileexaminationcenter.
Participants: Children from birth through 18 years who
participated in NHANES (N=10 136).
Main Exposure: Frequency of use of any dietary supple-
ment product.
Outcome Measure: Prevalence of use and intake of key
nutrients from supplements among children.
Results: In 1999-2002, 31.8% of children used dietary
supplements, with the lowest use reported among in-
fants younger than 1 year (11.9%) and teenagers 14 to
18 years old (25.7%) and highest use among 4- to 8-year-
old children (48.5%). Use was highest among non-
Hispanic white (38.1%) and Mexican American (22.4%)
participants, lowest among non-Hispanic black partici-
pants (18.8%), and was not found to differ by sex. The
type of supplement most commonly used was multivi-
tamins and multiminerals (18.3%). Ascorbic acid (28.6%),
retinol (25.8%), vitamin D (25.6%), calcium (21.1%), and
iron (19.3%) were the primary supplemental nutrients
consumed. Supplement use was associated with fami-
lies with higher incomes; a smoke-free environment; not
being certified by the US Department of Agriculture Spe-
cial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, In-
fants and Children in the last 12 months; lower child body
mass index; and less daily recreational screen time (tele-
vision, video games, computers, etc) (P.005). The high-
est prevalence of supplement use (P.005) was in chil-
dren who were underweight or at risk for underweight
(P.005).
Conclusions: More than 30% of children in the United
States take dietary supplements regularly, most often mul-
tivitamins and multiminerals. Given such extensive use,
nutrient intakes from dietary supplements must be in-
cluded to obtain accurate estimates of overall nutrient
intake in children.

MOST ADULTS IN THE
United States take di-
etary supplements.1-6
In the 1999-2000 Na-
tional Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey (NHANES),
57% of women and 47% of men reported
using a supplement in the past 30 days.6
Adult dietary supplement users in the
United States typically have higher in-
comes and education levels, are more
physically active, and have diets that more
closely follow dietary guidelines than non-
users.6-11 In contrast, little is known about
supplement use by infants, children, and
adolescents (henceforth children).
The American Academy of Pediatrics
and other professional organizations em-
phasize diet as the best source of nutri-
tion for healthy children.12,13 However,
since the 1930s, physicians have recom-
mended nutrient supplements for chil-
dren whom they believe are at risk of de-
ficiency.14,15 Because rickets continues to
be a concern, the American Academy of
Pediatrics recommends a supplement con-
taining 200 IU of vitamin D per day for in-
fants who are breastfed or who ingest less
than 500 mL per day of vitamin D­forti-
fied formula or milk and for children and
adolescents without regular exposure to
sunlight who ingest less than 500 mL of
vitamin D­fortified milk per day and do
not take a daily supplement containing at
least 200 IU of vitamin D.16-19 Other nu-
trients are recommended for children at
risk of specific deficiencies because of their
environment or lifestyles.12,20-22
Data on the use of dietary supple-
ments among nationally representative
samples of US children are more limited
than for adults. Available data indicate that
past prevalence of dietary supplement use
among children was similar to or greater

than that of adults.4-7,11,23-28 The prevalence of regular vi-
tamin or mineral supplement use in the 1976-1980
NHANES II varied from 41.7% for 1- to 2-year-old chil-
dren to as low as 10.1% for 11- to 19-year-old males.26
The 1981 National Health Interview Survey indicated that
36% of US children younger than 18 years used a vita-
min or mineral supplement within the past 2 weeks.25
(The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, is the principle source
of information on the health of the US population. It has
been conducted continually since 1957.) More recent data
from the 1991 follow-up to the 1988 National Maternal
and Infant Health Survey indicated that 54.4% of all
3-year-old children in a nationally representative sample
were given a vitamin-mineral supplement in the past
month.27
In the 1988-1994 NHANES III, young children (age,
1-5 years) exhibited the highest prevalence of supple-
mental vitamin and mineral use during the past month
(42.0%-51.0%), with a lower prevalence through the teen-
age years (12-19 years; 21.4%-32.9%).5,23,28-31 These data
are the best nationally representative information avail-
able on dietary supplement intake in children during the
past 30 years. This report presents the latest national es-
timates of dietary supplement use among US children de-
rived from the most recent NHANES data from 1999-
2002. Nutrients from supplements may provide a
significant contribution to the overall nutrition of a child,
which cannot be discounted in assessing overall health.
METHODS
THE NATIONAL HEALTH AND NUTRITION
EXAMINATION SURVEY
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey is a na-
tionally representative, cross-sectional examination survey that
includes personal and family interviews, usually conducted in
the home, and a medical examination in an NHANES mobile
examination center. It samples the US noninstitutional civil-
ian population using a complex, stratified, multistage prob-
ability cluster sampling design.32,33 Participant consent is re-
quired. Participants older than 17 years sign their own consent
forms. Parents sign consent forms for children younger than
18 years, though children 12 through 17 years also sign a form.
While adults generally respond to the survey questions for chil-
dren younger than 18 years, the children often participate.
We used combined data from the 1999-2000 and 2001-
2002 NHANES data releases,32,33 which included 21 004 indi-
viduals (of whom 10 150 were aged between birth and 18 years)
with interview data and 9755 with examination data. Dietary
supplement data were available for 10 136. Table 1 presents
unweighted sample sizes and weighted percentages of US chil-
dren who used supplements in 1999-2002 by selected demo-
graphic and lifestyle characteristics.
UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS
Eight demographic and household characteristics (Table 1) were
used as covariates in the analyses: age; race/ethnicity; annual fam-
ily income; family health insurance status; household participa-
tion in the US Department of Agriculture Special Supplemental
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC);
smokers in the household; total time spent by the child engaged
in television, computer, and/or videogame screen time per day;
and the child's body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in ki-
lograms divided by height in meters squared; only available for
children older than 2 years). We categorized each child's age in
months into 1 of the 5 groups used in the Dietary Reference In-
takes34: younger than 1 year, 1 to 3 years, 4 to 8 years, 9 to 13
years, and 14 to 18 years of age. We calculated each child's BMI
using measured height and/or length, weight, and age and cat-
egorized each child as underweight (5th percentile), at risk of
underweight(5th-15thpercentiles),probablyhealthyweight(15th-
85th percentiles), at risk of overweight (85th-95th percentiles),
and overweight (95th percentile), using BMI for males and fe-
males separately based on the National Center for Health Statis-
ticschartsandtheUSDepartmentofAgriculture/AgriculturalRe-
search Service Children's Nutrition Research Center categorical
criteria.35-37 The population-weighted prevalence of children in
the 5 BMI categories were underweight (3.6%), at risk of under-
weight (5.8%), probably healthy weight (61.3%), at risk of over-
weight (14.4%), and overweight (14.9%). Older children had a
higher prevalence of overweight or being at risk of overweight.
DIETARY SUPPLEMENT DATA COLLECTION
Participants, or their proxies if the participant was younger than
16 years, were asked if they had taken any vitamins, minerals,
or other dietary supplements in the past 30 days. Trained in-
terviewers recorded each supplement's name and manufac-
turer from the label, if possible, or from the participant. Par-
ticipants were also asked for how long, how often, and how
much they had taken each product. National Center for Health
Statistics staff later obtained the label for each supplement used.
DATA PREPARATION AND CALCULATIONS
National Center for Health Statistics staff incorporated supple-
ment-label information--including the name, ingredient con-
tents and amount, product form, recommended intake, and in-
tended target age of the product (infant, child, adult, or older
adult)--into the data record. For supplements where Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics staff could not identify a prod-
uct match, the participant was coded as having taken a supple-
ment, but no label details were included.
Dietary supplements were independently categorized in the
NHANES database based on their ingredients using 2-digit codes
to represent ingredient classes (eg, single botanical, single min-
eral, single amino acid, and multiple vitamin). The 804 indi-
vidualsupplementswerecodedinto177dietarysupplementtypes,
thenconsolidatedinto40(1999-2000)and44(2001-2002)larger
type classes, such as multivitamin and multimineral, multibo-
tanical, and multimineral, for our analysis. All steps in the cat-
egorizationwerecross-checkedpriortoanalysis.Supplementtypes
with the highest prevalence of use are reported here.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data were analyzed using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary,
North Carolina), and SUDAAN, version 9.0 (RTI Interna-
tional, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) statistical soft-
ware programs. Standard errors were estimated using a Taylor
series linearization method that incorporated sampling weights
and used variance formulas appropriate for the NHANES sample
design. All statistical analyses used NHANES sample weights,
which accounted for unequal probabilities of selection, non-
response, and oversampling.38,39 Analyses were conducted on
the 1999-2002 data using the 1999-2002 NHANES 4-year in-
terview sample weights for the combined data.

Because of the large number of statistical tests employed,
we chose a very conservative significance level (=.005) in-
stead of 5% (=.05), so that only 0.5% of all tests would be
statistically significant by chance. As seen in Table 2, overall
differences by characteristics were tested using a Wald 2 sta-
tistic. We used t tests on unweighted and weighted frequency
distributions of BMI and total screen-viewing time by age cat-
egory to separately assess the interaction of age with these vari-
ables. Family income for all children younger than 19 years was
classified into 1 of the following 4 categories: $0 to $24 999;
$25 000 to $44 999; $45 000 to $64 999; and $65 000 or more.
Values were then coded as income level 1, 2, 3, or 4, and a lin-
ear trend test, derived using a logistic regression model, was
performed to assess whether or not prevalence of dietary supple-
ment use increased with annual family income. Linear trend
tests were conducted with 4 age categories (omitting infants
younger than 1 year because of their small numbers) and supple-
ment use (any and multivitamin/multimineral) and the preva-
lence of intake of the 6 nutrients in Table 2.
Multivariate analysis was performed using the 8 models that
showedsignificantvariationintheunivariateanalysis(Table 3).
WaldandSatterwaite-adjustedFtestswereusedtodeterminewhich
characteristicsweresignificantpredictorsofuse.Resultsfromthe
2 tests did not differ; results from the Wald F test are presented
in Table 3. Linear trend tests were performed to determine if the
probability of intake increased with income or age.
To place these results of dietary supplement use in chil-
dren in perspective with life span use in the United States, we
separately plotted the 1999-2002 NHANES data for all ages from
0 to 85 years and use of any dietary supplement by year of age

for children and 5-year age increments for adults (Figure).
Trend analyses were conducted separately on curves for chil-
dren (age, 0-18 years) and adults (age, 19-85 years).
RESULTS
Nearly one-third of children (31.8%) used any dietary
supplement in the past month, with no significant sex
differences (Table 2). When supplements were catego-
rized based on ingredients, 18.3% said they used multi-
vitamin and multimineral supplements. Use of other di-
etary supplement types was much lower: 4.2% for single
vitamins, 2.4% for single minerals, and 0.8% for any bo-
tanical supplements, with no significant differences by
sex. The remaining 6.1% of supplement use was divided
among a (1) diverse array of other supplement types com-

posed of single nutrients or (2) very low frequency of use
of complex ingredient combinations, including multivi-
tamins, multiminerals, botanicals, and supplements with
proprietary blends (40 separate dietary supplement types
in 1999-2000 and 44 types in 2001-2002). The most com-
monly used botanical supplements were citrus bioflavo-
noids, ginseng, echinacea, ginkgo, and grape seed ex-
tract. Type of supplement use differed significantly by
age for all categories of dietary supplements with the ex-
ception of single minerals (P.005).
The prevalence of dietary supplement use was lowest
(12%) in the first year, highest among young children,
and declined among adolescents (38% for children aged
1-3 years, 40% for children aged 4-8 years, 29% for chil-
dren aged 9-13 years, and 26% among teenagers 14-18
years old) (Table 2). When infants were excluded, in-
take of any dietary supplements and multivitamins/
multiminerals showed a significant linear downward trend
with increased categorical age (P.005).
When we separately plotted intake of any dietary
supplement by age, data conformed to a quadratic rela-
tionship (P.005); prevalence increased from infancy
with a peak at 5 years of age (40%), then declined in the
teenage years, as shown in the Figure. We placed supple-
ment use by children into the context of use across all
ages by also plotting the prevalence and SE of adult supple-
ment use by 5-year increments, from the same NHANES
series (1999-2002) (Figure). In contrast to children, there
is a significant (P.005) linear trend in prevalence of
supplement use for adults aged from 19 to 65 years, with
the highest prevalence in persons older than 65 years.
Overall, prevalence of any supplement use in the last 30
days increased from infancy to 40% in 5-year-old chil-
dren, followed by a decrease among teenagers, then a
steady increase in 5-year age increments through adult-
hood to age 65 years, where prevalence leveled off.
Table 2 summarizes the prevalence of supplement use
and intake of key nutrients from supplements by chil-
dren, as related to demographic and household charac-
teristics. More than 20% of US children take a dietary
supplement regularly, whether multivitamin/
multimineral, single nutrient, or various combinations
of nutrients and other supplement ingredients that con-
tain retinol, ascorbic acid, and vitamin D. Iron, which
has long been of concern in child health, is taken as a
supplement by approximately 19% of children. Supple-
mental fluoride is used by relatively few children (3.0%).
When infants were omitted, significant age differences
in the intakes of retinol, ascorbic acid, vitamin D, fluo-
ride, and iron followed the same trend as that of multi-
vitamin use, with an overall downward trend with in-
creased categorical age through the teenage years
(P.005). Intake prevalence of supplements and all nu-
trients from supplements, with the exception of fluo-
ride, was highest among children aged 4 to 8 years.

multimineral supplements, and supplements contain-
ing retinol, ascorbic acid, vitamin D, calcium, and iron

was highest among non-Hispanic white children and low-
est among non-Hispanic black children (P.005). Preva-
lence of use increased significantly with annual family
income (P.005) and was significantly higher in house-
holds that were not eligible for WIC in the past 12 months
(P<.005) and in families where no one in the house-
hold smoked (P.005). Linear trend analysis was sig-
nificant (P.005) for categorical family income for the
use of any dietary supplements, multivitamin and mul-
timineral supplements, and intake of retinol, ascorbic acid,
vitamin D, fluoride, and iron.
Children in families with health insurance were sig-
nificantly more likely to use supplements that con-
tained retinol, ascorbic acid, vitamin D, and calcium
(P.005). Children who engaged in more hours of com-
bined recreational television, video game, and/or com-
puter game use per day had a lower prevalence of use of
any dietary supplements and lower intakes of retinol,
ascorbic acid, and vitamin D from supplements (P.005).
With the exception of fluoride intake, use of any supple-
ment, use of multivitamins and multiminerals, and nu-
trient intake from supplements was higher in children
with lower BMIs. This association reached statistical sig-
nificance with children's use of any dietary supplement
and multivitamin and minerals, as well as intakes of reti-
nol and vitamin D from dietary supplements (P.005).
Additional analyses demonstrated that children who
used supplements took them regularly, with more than
50% having taken a supplement 30 times in the past
month and more than 60% having taken supplements for
at least 12 months. Among children who used supple-
ments, an estimated 83.9% took 1 supplement, 11.8% took
2, and 4.3% took 3 or more. Teenagers (age, 14-18 years)
were significantly more likely to have taken 2 or more
supplements compared with younger children (P.005).
Non-Hispanic black children were the least likely to take
more than 1 supplement (P.005).
Table 3 presents a multivariate model analysis of the
adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for
demographic and household variables. A child's age was
significantly associated with use of any dietary supple-
ment, multivitamins and multiminerals, and intake of iron,
fluoride, retinol, ascorbic acid, and vitamin D from supple-
ments (P.005). There was a statistically significant lin-
ear decrease with increasing age for use of any dietary
supplement and intake of fluoride, retinol, and vitamin
D from supplements (P.005). Significant (P.005)
positive associations for use of any dietary supplement
were apparent for non-Hispanic white children, for chil-
dren from families with higher incomes, and for house-
holds without smokers.
COMMENT
Dietary supplement use has increased among adults in
recent years,6 yet it appears to have remained relatively
constant or to have declined in children. This population-
based survey indicated that about one-third of US chil-
dren took supplements in 1999-2002. The prevalence of
supplement use increases from low levels in infants and
young children to about 49% for 5-year-old children, fol-
lowed by a steady decline to 20% among 15-year-old ado-
lescents, with an increase among older teenagers (28%)
and into young adulthood (Figure). These data are the
first to include information on the use of botanical as well
as nutrient-containing dietary supplements among chil-
dren. Few children younger than 3 years used botanical

supplements, and the maximum prevalence was only 1%
in teenagers. Use of botanicals and specialty supple-
ments show up primarily in some smaller, location-
specific studies, but the national data presented here sug-
gests that such use is neither widespread nor uniform.40-42
Supplement use among teenagers appears to have re-
mained relatively constant since it was first recorded by
NHANES in the 1970s.31,43 In contrast, there appears to
have been a decline in supplement use among nation-
ally representative samples of young children, from
roughly 50% of children aged 1 to 3 years from the 1970s
to the mid-1990s27-31 to 38% in our study. In part, this
may be because of revisions in infant formulas after the
Infant Formula Act of 1980, which are now fortified with
iron, vitamin D, and other nutrients, making them com-
plete foods for infants.
Multivitamins and multiminerals remain the most com-
monly consumed type of dietary supplement in all pedi-
atric age groups,26,30,31,43,44 with more than 25% of children
overall receiving retinol, ascorbic acid, and vitamin D from
these products. As was found in earlier studies,30 most chil-
dren take only 1 dietary supplement. As in NHANES III30
and among adults in the 1999-2000 survey,6 supplement
users and nonusers differed in specific characteristics. Di-
etary supplement use was highest among non-Hispanic
white children, those from higher-income families, those
whose families were not eligible for WIC, those who had
nonsmoking environments, and children who engaged in
less video and television use.
ChildreninthelowestBMIcategoriesandathighestrisk
of underweight had the highest prevalence of supplement
use,whichwassignificantlyhigherthanforoverweightchil-
dren. The follow-up to the 1988 National Maternal and In-
fant Health Survey did not include BMI but found that chil-
drenaged3yearswhousedsupplementshadsimilarfamilial
and lifestyle profiles and were more often reported to have
eating problems or poor appetites.27 Young children at the
lowest BMI for age (near or below the 5% level of weight
for height-reference categories) might appear thin to par-
ents and other caretakers and might be given more dietary
supplements to "make them healthy." These findings sup-
port previous suppositions that supplement use in young
children is based on caregivers' perception of the health of
the child and their own dietary beliefs.27 An alternative ex-
planation might be that children with lower BMIs are more
likely to be part of health-oriented families and therefore
be more physically active and spend less time at seden-
tary, screen-related recreation.
Withtheexceptionofinfants,wefoundthelowestpreva-
lenceofsupplementuseinolderteenagers(age,14-18years).
Otherstudieshavefoundthatyoungteenagerswhodonot
take supplements have diets that are less likely to meet na-
tionaldietaryguidelinesandtobeatriskforconsumingless
than recommended amounts of nutrients.24,44,45
Current pediatric recommendations are for children to
receive their nutrients principally from diet with supple-
mentation in specific situations,such as supplemental fluo-
rideinareasonlywheretherearenoorsuboptimalamounts
of fluoride in the drinking water46 and vitamin and/or min-
eral supplements for children at risk of specific nutrient de-
ficiencies because of their age and/or life situa-
tions.12,13,19-22 Ouranalysisindicatesthatapproximately30%
of children receive dietary supplements and that the high-
est prevalence of nutrient intakes from these products are
for retinol, ascorbic acid, vitamin D, calcium, and iron. Cal-
cium, vitamin D, and iron are nutrients of most concern
for healthy childhood development and bone growth and
are often consumed in lower than recommended
amounts.12,13,19-22,43,45 The limited use of fluoride supple-
ments by childreninthis analysis may reflectphysicianand
dental practitioner concerns about excess fluoride intakes
associated with dental fluorosis.46
These data also illustrate that children in higher-
incomefamilies,childrenwithlessrecreationalscreentime,
and children in smoke-free households are most likely to
usesupplements.Incontrast,childreninfamilieswithlower
income, non-Hispanic black children, children in families
without heath insurance, children in households where
people smoke, and children who spend more time en-
gaged in recreational screen time are the least likely to take
supplements.Adultswhousedietarysupplementshavebeen
described as similarly differing from nonusers in lifestyle,
demographic, health, and dietary characteristics.6,10,11
The strength of NHANES data on supplement use is
that information is recorded directly from the label by
trained interviewers in participants' homes, the data are
reviewed by NHANES nutritionists, and the data can be
used for nationally representative group estimates. Limi-
tations of this study include the cross-sectional design
of NHANES; respondent reporting errors caused by use
of proxies for those younger than 16 years; and differ-
ences in definitions and methodology over time, which
limit comparisons of prevalence data regarding dietary
supplement use among different survey cycles within
NHANES and with other nationally representative
samples, such as the Continuing Survey of Food Intake
by Individuals and the National Maternal and Infant
Health Survey.3,26,28
In conclusion, dietary supplements provide a consis-
tentdailysourceofnutrientsfornearlyone-thirdofUSchil-
dren, yet individual and national-level estimates of nutri-
ent intake rarely account for them.44,47,48 Dietary Reference
Intakes34 and Dietary Guidelines for Americans49 provide
recommended nutrient intakes and advice on food choices
that promote health and reduce the risk of disease. To truly
assess the nutrient status and estimate the potential health
risks of US children, we must include nutrient intakes from
dietary supplements as well as from food.
