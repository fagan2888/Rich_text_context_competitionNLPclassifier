ABURGEONING literature links parental well-being to
qualities of their relationships with grown children
(Fingerman, Pitzer, Lefkowitz, Birditt, & Mroczek, 2008;
Lowenstein, 2007; Pudrovska, 2009; Umberson, Pudrovska,
& Reczek, 2010; Ward, 2008). Although positive and nega-
tive feelings in relationships undoubtedly play an important
role in parental well-being, other facets of offspring's lives
may also be significant. Parents have a distinct investment
in grown children reflecting decades of child rearing. This
study drew on the developmental stake hypothesis, which
posits that parents are more invested in their grown children
than children are in parents (Giarrusso, Feng, & Bengtson,
2005; Shapiro, 2004). Moreover, parents tend to view their
offspring as extensions of themselves, even after their
children are grown (Levitzki, 2009). As such, parents may
experience lower well-being when grown children suffer
problems. Likewise, parents may experience increased
well-being when children are successful.
Further, we considered multiple children. Although fer-
tility rates have dropped in the past 50 years, most parents
in the United States have more than one child (Hagestad &
Uhlenberg, 2007). Yet, most studies of parental well-being
have examined only one grown child (e.g., Knoester, 2003;
Silverstein & Bengtson, 1991; Umberson 1992; for excep-
tions, see Suitor, Pillemer, & Sechrist, 2006; Ward, 2008).
The few studies addressing problems and successes have
asked about children in general, rather than considering
within-family patterns (Pillemer & Suitor, 1991; Ryff, Lee,
Essex, & Schmutte, 1994). Parental well-being may vary
depending on whether one child or all children suffer problems,
whether some are successful, or all offspring are successful.
Grown Children's Problems and Successes and Parental
Well-being
We tested two models regarding multiple grown chil-
dren's problems and successes: (a) an exposure model and
(b) a cumulative stress and rewards model. The exposure
model implies that having even one problem-ridden or suc-
cessful child may evoke emotional reactions associated
with parental well-being. The cumulative model suggests
that having a greater number of problems or successes in the
family will show an incremental association with better or
worse parental well-being.
Offspring problems.--Due to their investment in off-
spring, parents may be distressed when offspring incur dif-
ficulties. Prior studies have found associations between

Objectives. Middle-aged parents' well-being may be tied to successes and failures of grown children. Moreover, most
parents have more than one child, but studies have not considered how different children's successes and failures may be
associated with parental well-being.
Methods. Middle-aged adults (aged 40­60; N = 633) reported on each of their grown children (n = 1,384) and rated
their own well-being. Participants indicated problems each child had experienced in the past two years, rated their chil-
dren's successes, as well as positive and negative relationship qualities.
Results. Analyses compared an exposure model (i.e., having one grown child with a problem or deemed successful)
and a cumulative model (i.e., total problems or successes in the family). Consistent with the exposure and cumulative
models, having one child with problems predicted poorer parental well-being and the more problems in the family, the
worse parental well-being. Having one successful child did not predict well-being, but multiple grown children with
higher total success in the family predicted enhanced parental well-being. Relationship qualities partially explained
associations between children's successes and parental well-being.
Discussion. Discussion focuses on benefits and detriments parents derive from how grown progeny turn out and
particularly the implications of grown children's problems.

PARENTAL WELL-BEING AND GROWN CHILDREN 185
offspring's problems and poorer parental well-being (e.g.,
Greenfield & Marks, 2006; Milkie, Bierman, & Schieman,
2008; Pillemer et al., 2007; Suitor et al., 2006). In these
studies, researchers have assessed negative events in off-
spring's lives such as illnesses, emotional problems, di-
vorce, problems with the law, and financial or employment
issues. Detrimental life events lead to increased worry and
depressive feelings among parents (Hay, Fingerman, &
Lefkowitz, 2007), perhaps in part because they violate pa-
rental desire to see children in a positive light. Likewise,
offspring's distress as a result of difficult life circumstances
may affect parents' well-being. Knoester (2003) found
that children's psychological distress led, over time, to an
erosion of parents' well-being.
Moreover, parents may experience greater distress when
offspring's problems may be due to their own behaviors or
lifestyle, as opposed to less controllable physical or emo-
tional situations (Birditt, Fingerman, & Zarit, 2010; Pillemer
& Suitor, 1991; Pillemer et al., 2007; Suitor et al., 2006). For
example, parents may deem problems with the law or drug
and alcohol addiction as more controllable, thus evoking dis-
appointment and anger. Physical and emotional difficulties
such as health problems, developmental disabilities, or psy-
chopathology may evoke empathetic distress but less blame.
The exposure model suggests that even one child with
problems may diminish parental well-being as in the apho-
rism, "A mother is only as happy as her least happy child."
This model is consistent with the premise that negative
emotions are more intense and exert greater influence on
well-being than positive emotions (Baumeister, Bratslavsky,
Finkenauer, & Vohs, 2001). Even one child suffering a
problem may dampen parental well-being, particularly if
the problem arises from the child's own behaviors (Pillemer &
Suitor, 1991).
The cumulative model is derived from theories of stress
that suggest individuals may weather a single stress suc-
cessfully but find it increasingly difficult to cope when mul-
tiple challenges accumulate (Pearlin, Pioli, & McLaughlin,
2001). Based on this theory, we predicted parents with a
greater number of problematic children would have lower
well-being than parents with fewer problematic children
(Milkie et al., 2008).
Offspring success.--By contrast, due to parents' invest-
ment in their children, parental well-being may benefit from
grown children's achievements. Successful offspring may
make parents feel they did a good job raising them (Ryff
et al., 1994). Parents may bask in their children's accom-
plishments. Successful offspring also provide support to their
middle-aged parents (Fingerman, Miller, Birditt, & Zarit,
2009) and are expected to provide assistance in the future
when parents experience declines of old age (Pillemer &
Suitor, 2006).
Prior studies of offspring's achievements have taken two
approaches to measurement. Some studies have examined
attainment of adult roles (e.g., marriage, employment) as
indicators of achievement (Fingerman, Chen, Hay, Cichy, &
Lefkowitz, 2006; Suitor, Sechrist, & Pillemer, 2007). Other
studies, however, have used parental assessments of off-
spring's successes (e.g., Birditt et al., 2010; Cichy, Finger-
man, & Lefkowitz, 2007; Levitzki, 2009; Ryff et al., 1994).
Young adults may be working to attain adult roles, and thus,
objective indicators do not assess their potential for eventual
success (e.g., an 18-year-old may be pursuing education).
Parents' appraisals of grown children's successes may
better incorporate future potential than do objective indica-
tors especially among offspring aged 18­23 (Fingerman
et al., 2009). Here, we used parental appraisals of offspring
achievement.
With regard to multiple children, consistent with the
exposure model, one successful child may give a parent
bragging rights, provide support, or render a sense of ac-
complishment that enhances well-being. Having many suc-
cessful grown children may enhance these effects.
Alternately, due to ceiling effects on measures of well-being,
a plateau may occur whereby parental well-being is not
improved by more children with more successes.
Mixture of children with problems and successes.--We
also examined the mix of children suffering problems or
deemed particularly successful in the family. Family mem-
bers often share socioeconomic backgrounds associated
with problems and success (Grundy, 2005). Thus, a parent
who has one child suffering a problem may have other chil-
dren who suffer problems. Alternately, siblings' attempt to
differentiate themselves from their brothers and sisters may
lead to differences in achievement or problems among sib-
lings in the same family (Conley, Pfeiffer, & Velez, 2007;
Sulloway, 1996). Thus, we examined whether children in
families are similar to or different from one another with
regard to successes and problems (e.g., all children suffer
problems, all have successes, or there is a mixture in the
family).
Likewise, we were interested in whether a successful
child mitigates effects of children who suffer problems on
parental well-being. This issue has not been investigated but
having a successful child may reaffirm one's ability as a
parent, support the sibling with problems, or mitigate dele-
terious effects of the child who suffers problems. We exam-
ined possible moderating effects of successful children in
the same family as children who suffer problems.
Relationship Qualities With Grown Children Who Suffer
Problems or Incur Success
The second goal of this study was to assess whether rela-
tionship qualities explain associations between grown chil-
dren's successes and problems and parental well-being.
Children engulfed in their own problems may generate con-
flict. Milkie and colleagues (2008) found that parents who
FINGERMAN ET AL.
186
reported their children had problems also reported being
poorly treated by children. Another study found parents ex-
perienced more negative feelings in relationships with off-
spring suffering problems (Birditt et al., 2010). Offspring
who incur problems also evoke greater ambivalence for par-
ents (Fingerman et al., 2006; Pillemer et al., 2007). Thus,
we predicted parents with children who suffer problems
would report poorer well-being, in part because parents ex-
perience more conflict and negative emotions with these
offspring.
We also considered positive feelings in the relationship.
Our prior research suggests parents experience comparable
feelings of affection for children who suffer problems and
who incur successes (Birditt et al., 2010). Other studies sug-
gest parents have more positive relationships with grown
children who have achieved normative markers of adult-
hood (Suitor et al., 2007) and who are deemed successful
(Fingerman et al., 2009). Thus, affectionate ties or positive
quality relationships may help explain why successful chil-
dren would be associated with better parental well-being.
Additional Factors Associated with Relationships Between
Adults and Their Parents
In examining the models, we considered family size.
Larger families may be more likely to provide support for
the exposure model because the probability of having at
least one child with a problem or perceived as successful is
greater in larger families. Family size also has implications
for the cumulative model; the total number of problems or
successes is greater in larger families. Studies have included
number of children as a control variable and found contra-
dictory associations with parental well-being (Koropoeckyj-
Cox, 2002; Ward, 2008). Here, we took a distinct approach
and considered possible moderating effects of family size
on patterns of association.
Middle-aged parents have relationships with grown chil-
dren spanning from late adolescence to early midlife them-
selves. Children of different ages may have different
implications for parental well-being. For example, parents
may habituate to older offspring's problems or successes.
Thus, younger offspring might have a greater impact on
well-being because their problems or successes have long-
term implications for their future. Alternately, parents may
view offspring in young adulthood as malleable and may be
less affected by what they view as transient problems or
successes. We examined offspring's age as a possible mod-
erating variable on patterns in this study.
We also included covariates that might account for paren-
tal well-being. Some studies find mothers' well-being is
more susceptible to grown children's successes and prob-
lems than fathers' (Rossi & Rossi, 1990; Ryff et al., 1994),
but other studies have found offspring affect mothers and
fathers similarly (Fingerman et al., 2008; Knoester, 2003;
Pillemer & Suitor, 1991). We included parental gender
without a specific hypothesis. Parental marital status also
may play a role in patterns of association. Parents who are
married typically rate their spouse as their most important
social contact, but unmarried parents rate their children as
their most important contacts (Fingerman, Hay, & Birditt,
2004). Socioeconomic status indicators such as household
income and education are associated with well-being
(Farmer & Ferraro, 2005). We also considered race because
offspring problems have been found to exert a greater effect
on African American than White parents (Milkie et al.,
2008). Finally, because families may share stressful circum-
stances (Greenfield & Marks, 2006), we controlled for
problems in the parents' own lives to ascertain whether their
children's problems contributed to their well-being.
In sum, this study examined problems and successes of
multiple children and parental well-being. We compared (a)
the exposure model (i.e., having one child with a success or
problem) and (b) the cumulative model (i.e., multiple chil-
dren with multiple problems and successes). The literature
does not provide a basis for favoring one model. Using
these models, we expected parents with children who incur
problems to report more negative relationship quality and
negative relationship qualities to be associated with parents'
poorer well-being. We predicted the opposite pattern for
successful grown children.
Method
The sample included adults aged 40­60 from the Family
Exchanges Study who had at least one child older than 18
years and who resided in the Philadelphia Primary Metro-
politan Statistical Area, covering urban, suburban, and rural
areas (Pennsylvania State Data Center, 2001). Potential par-
ticipants were identified via purchased listed samples and
random digit dialing within regional area codes. Partici-
pants completed computer-assisted telephone interviews
regarding their well-being and relationships with grown off-
spring. In 2007, 92% of adults in this age range lived in
households with landlines (Blumberg & Luke, 2008).
Sample Description
Participant characteristics.--Table 1 includes back-
ground information regarding participants and their grown
children. By oversampling high-density minority neigh-
borhoods, we obtained a diverse sample; 31% of the sam-
ple identified themselves as African American and 6% as
multiracial.
Participants provided their age (M = 50.60, SD = 4.99
years); gender (302 men, 331 women; 52% women); mari-
tal status; and household income in 2007 coded as 1 (less
than $10,000), 2 ($10,001­$25,000), 3 ($25,001­$40,000),
4 ($40,001­$75,000), 5 ($75,001­$100,000), and 6 (more
than $100,000). The sample was slightly better educated
(M = 14.18 years of education, SD = 2.02) but comparable
PARENTAL WELL-BEING AND GROWN CHILDREN 187
on income to the general population of the Philadelphia area
(median income $40,001­$75,000; U.S. Census Bureau,
2008; see Fingerman et al., 2009). On a scale of 1 (poor) to
5 (excellent), participants rated their health as good to very
good (M = 3.48, SD = 1.09).
Offspring characteristics.--On average, participants had
2.16 children older than 18 years (SD = 1.46, range 1­11).
For each child older than 18 years (N = 1,384), participants
reported background characteristics, problems, and support.
To avoid fatigue, we asked participants detailed information
(i.e., success, relationship qualities) for up to three grown
children. Most participants (n = 555, 88%) had three or
fewer children. For the 12% of participants with four or
more grown children, we selected the child who received
most assistance, least assistance, and a random child.
Because this study focused on parental well-being, we
aggregated offspring characteristics within parents prior to
examining descriptive information about the offspring.
Thus, characteristics of offspring in larger families did not
bias the descriptive data. As can be seen in Table 1, off-
spring ranged in age from 18 to 42 years (M = 24.24, SD =
4.95); most offspring (90%) were aged 18­33. Among fam-
ilies with more than one child, 25% had all daughters, 31%
had all sons, and 44% had a mix of sons and daughters.

ies to assess life problems, we asked participants whether

any of their children had experienced nine problems in the
past two years (Fingerman et al., 2009; Greenfield & Marks,
2006; Milkie et al., 2008). When participants indicated one
or more child had incurred a problem, they identified which
child(ren). We then coded each problem dichotomously (0,
1) for each child. Drawing on prior research (Pillemer et al.,
2007; Suitor et al., 2006), we first generated two subscales:
physical and emotional problems and lifestyle or behavioral
problems (Birditt et al., 2010). Physical and emotional
problems included developmental delay, physical disability,
health problem or injury, and psychological problems. Life-
style­behavior problems included trouble with the law,
drinking or drug problems, financial difficulties, divorce, or
serious relationships problems. We asked about being a vic-
tim of a crime, but this item did not load on either scale in
confirmatory factor analysis. We also generated a total scale
combining the two subscales. We also had reports of these
problems for a subset of parents (n = 399) whose family
members also participated in the study.
Offspring achievements.--Participants rated each child's
achievement compared with adults the same age for (a)
relationships and family life and (b) education and career
from 1 (less successful) to 5 (more successful). These two
items were derived from a study using open-ended re-
sponses regarding offspring's achievements (Ryff et al.,
1994). The measure was parsimonious to allow parents to
complete it for each child. These parental ratings corre-
spond to actual achievements for offspring older than 24
years (Fingerman et al., 2009). See Table 2 for the distribu-
tion of offspring's problems and successes by family.
Relationship qualities with offspring.--As in prior stud-
ies, we assessed positive qualities of the relationship using
two items (how much does he/she make you feel loved and
cared for, how much does he/she understand you) and nega-
tive relationship qualities using two items (how much does
he/she criticize you or make demands on you) rated from 1
(not at all) to 5 (a great deal; Birditt et al., 2010; Fingerman
et al., 2008, 2009; Umberson, 1992).
FINGERMAN ET AL.
188
Dependent Variable: Parental Well-being
Using procedures based on World Health Organization
recommendations and prior studies, we devised a composite
score for psychological well-being (Antonucci, Ajrouch, &
Janevic, 2003; Fingerman et al., 2009; World Health Orga-
nization Quality of Life Group, 1998). The score combined
a standardized one-item assessment of life satisfaction
(Diener, Gohm, Suh, & Oishi, 2000), rated from 1 (not at
all satisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied) and the five-
item depression scale from the Brief Symptom Inventory
(Derogatis, 2000; Derogatis & Melisarator, 1983), a = .83.
We reverse coded the depression scale prior to estimating z
scores, such that higher scores represent better psychological
well-being.
Covariates
We included covariates coded as follows: gender 1
(father), 0 (mother); age in years; marital status 1 (married
or remarried), 0 (not married); years of education; income
from 1 (less than $10,000) to 6 (more than $100,000);
minority status 1 (ethnic or racial minority), 0 (non-Hispanic
White); and number of children in the family. Because we
only obtained parental problems for a subset of parents, we
controlled for parental problems in post hoc analyses.
Analytic Strategy
We first examined the distribution of children's successes
and problems. Then, we assessed effects of multiple grown
children on parental well-being with regard to the exposure
and the cumulative stress model. Choices in aggregating
multiple children have theoretical as well as statistical im-
plications. We considered (a) an exposure model, using the
metric of the presence of one child suffering problems or
deemed successful, and (b) cumulative stress and rewards
model, using the metric of the total sum of problems or the
total success scores across all children in the family. Consis-
tent with other studies of multiple grown children (e.g.,
Ward, 2008), we used ordinary least squares (OLS) regres-
sion to examine associations among these metrics (e.g., to-
tal number of problems) and parental well-being.
We conducted analyses to assure that family size did not
bias results. Analyses included two tests of whether family
size moderates associations between children's problems
and successes and parental well-being: (a) regression mod-
els with interaction terms between family size and problems
or successes and (b) separate regression models for families
with one grown children versus multiple grown children.
We also estimated the exposure models in a stratified man-
ner by family size, including a weight for the probability of
having a child with a problem or deemed successful.
Finally, we first tested hypotheses regarding children's
problems by examining behavioral­lifestyle problems versus
health and emotional problems in separate models. The
pattern of findings was identical for the two types of prob-
lems. Thus, we did not differentiate types of problems further.
Results
Distributions of Successes and Problems
At the parent level, 68.2% (n = 432) reported at least one
grown child suffered one or more problems in the prior two
years. The proportion of parents who had a grown child
who was above average in success (i.e., 4 or 5 on ratings of
success) was 48.7% of parents (n = 308).
Next, we looked at these ratings with regard to each child.
Overall, parents indicated 45% of their offspring had expe-
rienced at least one problem in the prior year and rated
43.4% of their offspring as more successful than others the
same age.
Given these findings, a median split offered a mathemat-
ically simple and face-valid means of dividing grown chil-
dren as high or low on problems and successes. For
problems, the median fell at 1 problem. The median split
fell between 3 and 4 on each success item.
Using this split, we examined the distributions of chil-
dren suffering problems and success within the same fami-
lies. Distributions for the 633 parents were as follows: (a)
all children above average in success and none suffering
problems (n = 106, 17%), (b) all children suffering at least
one problem and none above average on success (n = 96,
15%), (c) a mixture of children suffering problems or
deemed successful (n = 382, 60%), or (d) no children in the
upper half for problems or success (n = 49, 8%).
We looked separately at parents who had two or more
grown children (n = 431) and thus had the possibility of
both a child deemed successful and a child with problems.
Of these parents, 329 (76%) fell in the "mixed" category, 51
(12%) had all successful children, 39 (9%) had all children
suffering problems, and only 13 (3%) had children with nei-
ther indicator. In sum, most parents with more than one
child reported a mix of problematic and successful children.
Children With Problems or Success and Parental
Well-being
To test hypotheses regarding children's successes and
problems, we used OLS regression with the composite
well-being measure as the outcome. Table 3 presents the
tests of the exposure and cumulative models for the associa-
tion between child problems and parental well-being. Con-
sistent with the exposure model, having even one child
suffering problems was associated with poorer well-being.
Consistent with the cumulative stress model, a higher sum of
problems in the family was associated with poorer parental
well-being.
Table 3 presents the test of the exposure and cumulative
effect models for associations between children's success and
parental well-being. Findings did not support the exposure
PARENTAL WELL-BEING AND GROWN CHILDREN 189
model; simply having one successful child was not associ-
ated with parental well-being. Findings did support the
cumulative model; parents who reported more children with
greater total success reported better well-being.
We then conducted analyses to examine whether associa-
tions between children's problems and success and parental
well-being were consistent in analyses using family con-
figuration. We estimated a regression including the categor-
ical classification of families: (a) all successful children, (b)
a mixture of children deemed successful and children suf-
fering problems, and (c) all children suffering problems.
Post hoc tests for this categorical predictor revealed the
three groups significantly differed with regard to parents'
well-being. Participants who had all successful children re-
ported the highest level of well-being, followed by partici-
pants with a mix of children with success and problems, and
parents whose children all suffered problems reported the
poorest well-being, controlling for number of children and
other variables.
Finally, we tested the hypothesis that having a successful
child or multiple successes in the family buffers against del-
eterious effects of children with problems on parental well-
being. We included interaction terms between children with
successes or problems: (a) presence of one or more children
with problem × one or more children with success and (b)
total number of problems × total success scores within family.
These interaction terms were not significant.
Relationship Qualities and Parental Well-being
We then examined whether relationship qualities may
explain why children with problems or success are associated
with parental well-being. We averaged negative relationship
quality scores for children in each family and also consid-
ered the average of positive relationship quality scores for
children within each family (e.g., Lowenstein, 2007).
We estimated four OLS regressions with average ratings
of positive and negative relationship quality in the family as
the outcome variables. The metrics of problems and success
for the exposure and cumulative models (i.e., presence of
one child with problem or above median success, sum of
total problems and success scores within the family) served
as the predictors, and we included the control variables. For
example, we estimated a regression with average positive
relationship quality as the outcome and metrics for the
exposure model (i.e., presence of at least one child with
a problem or one child above the median on success) as
predictors. Then, we did the same for negative relationship
quality.
For the exposure model, the presence of at least one prob-
lematic or successful child did not predict positive relation-
ship quality. The total number of problems and success in
the family predicted both positive and negative relationship
quality (see Table 4). Parents who had more problematic
children and fewer successful children reported greater neg-
ative and lower positive relationship quality.

We then conducted OLS regression predicting parental
well-being using relationship qualities across children and
total problems and successes in the family as predictors.
Thus, we treated relationship qualities as proxy mediators
of the association between children's problems or success
and parental well-being. Positive and negative qualities of
relationships were associated with parental well-being, and
the effect of successful children was no longer significant
and reduced in size in this model. Having children with
problems continued to be significantly associated with
parental well-being (see Table 3).
Family Size and Parental Well-being
We conducted analyses to ascertain whether patterns of
findings differed as a function of family size. First, we con-
sidered whether number of children moderates patterns of
association. Treating family size as a continuous variable,
we centered the variables on their means and then estimated
two interaction terms, number of children × problems and
number of children × successes. We estimated regressions
with each of these interaction terms, including main effects
and covariates. No significant interactions emerged, but the
main effects remained significant.
We also separated the sample into the following: (a) fam-
ilies with one child and (b) families with two or more chil-
dren. When we examined these models, the effects remained
significant.
Finally, we estimated analyses regarding the exposure
model to account for differing probabilities of having at
least one child with a problem or with a success. For ex-
ample, 45% of grown children had at least one problem. In
families with two children, the chance that at least one child
had a problem was 69%; in families with three children, the
probability jumps to 83%. For the exposure model, we reran
analyses stratifying by family size and weighting by the prob-
ability that at least one child had a problem (1 - pfamily size,
i.e., 1 - .55family size for problems). The pattern of findings
was surprisingly robust, and significant effects remained for
problems and successes when analyses were estimated in
this manner.
Post hoc Tests of Stability in Findings
We reestimated the models to assure findings were stable.
We repeated the models with other metrics to assure stabil-
ity of findings: (a) maximum scores within a family (e.g.,
child with the best and the worst relationship quality; Ward,
2008), (b) total number of children in the family with a
problem or deemed successful. Findings were consistent
across metrics.
We also estimated the models for the 399 parents with
reports on their own problems, controlling for the number
of parent problems as a predictor. Parents' problems were
significantly associated with their well-being in all analy-
ses, but offspring's problems and successes remained sig-
nificant in each model as well.
We examined associations involving children's problems
or success and parental well-being for different groups of
parents. We estimated models separately for mothers and
fathers, for White and minority families, for married and
unmarried parents, and for families in which all the off-
spring were younger than 24 years and for families in which
at least one child was aged 24 or older. Again, findings were
consistent.
Discussion
This study contributes to a burgeoning literature indicating
the parent­child tie is associated with parents' well-being

PARENTAL WELL-BEING AND GROWN CHILDREN 191
(Byers, Levy,Allore, Bruce, & Kasl, 2008; Fingerman et al.,
2008; Lowenstein, 2007; Milkie et al., 2008; Pudrovska,
2009; Ward, 2008). Unlike previous research (e.g., Ryff
et al., 1994), this study examined midlife parents and their
perceptions of multiple grown children and revealed several
interesting findings. Importantly, there is considerable vari-
ability in parents' perceptions of their children's successes
and problems within and between families, and these per-
ceptions are associated with parents' overall well-being. In
particular, children suffering problems appear to affect their
parents' well-being, above and beyond the presence of suc-
cessful children or their own problems.
Grown Children With Problems or Deemed Successful
Prior studies have suggested that parents' well-being
suffers when grown children incur problems with health,
finances, or other circumstances (Koropoeckyj-Cox, 2002;
Milkie et al., 2008; Pillemer & Suitor, 1991). This study
contributes to that literature by assessing grown children's
accomplishments as well as problems. Our findings suggest
that parents may react to their grown children's successes as
well as their failures, but as we discuss, only when suc-
cesses in the family are cumulative.
To examine implications of grown children's successes
and failures, we considered an exposure model and a cumu-
lative model for the total number of problems or success
scores for all children. Interestingly, different theoretical
models apply when predicting parents' well-being, depend-
ing on whether we considered children's problems or suc-
cesses. Consistent with the exposure model, having even
one problematic child is harmful to parents' well-being but
having at least one successful child does not appear to have
the same effect. In line with the cumulative model, having
more grown children suffering a greater number of prob-
lems was associated with poorer parental well-being. For
successes, only when parents had many children with high
success, did parental well-being fare better. Thus, it may be
true that parents are only as happy as their least happy child.
Indeed, these findings are consistent with theory regard-
ing negative emotions. Literature reviews have established
that negative experiences typically are more salient and
more difficult to emotionally regulate than positive experi-
ences (Baumeister et al., 2001; Charles, 2010). Further-
more, studies find negative emotions tend to be of longer
duration and to exert a stronger influence on well-being
than do positive emotions (Larsen, 2009). The general
human tendency to be on the alert for negative events is
evident in other relationships. In the marital tie, differences
in negative interactions predict which couples will divorce,
but positive interactions do not (Karney & Bradbury, 1997;
Markman, Rhoades, Stanley, Ragan, & Whitton, 2010). At-
tention to adverse events involving one's progeny may have
served evolutionary purposes for survival and persist after
those offspring are grown.
The difference in findings for problems and successes also
may reflect distinct measurement techniques. Consistent
with prior research, we assessed negative life events by ex-
amining children's problems (Greenfield & Marks, 2006;
Milkie et al., 2008; Pillemer et al., 2007; Suitor et al., 2006).
The success ratings depended on subjective appraisals
(Fingerman et al., 2009; Ryff et al., 1994). If measurement
artifacts shaped the findings, however, we might expect
subjective appraisals of success to be more strongly associ-
ated with participant well-being than an objective list of
problems. Furthermore, in most families with more than one
grown child, parents rated children with successes and with
problems, suggesting parents were not rating offspring based
on their own psychological state. It is also notable that off-
spring's problems and successes contributed to parental well-
being controlling for their own problems. Nonetheless, future
research might seek greater comparability in assessments.
Moreover, our findings indicate the importance of con-
sidering multiple children in a family on parental well-
being (Ward, 2008). Having two children suffering problems
was more demanding than having only one child who suf-
fers problems. We also ascertained that one successful child
does not buffer effects of children suffering problems.
Relationship Qualities With Grown Children
Consistent with other studies (Fingerman et al., 2008;
Lowenstein, 2007; Silverstein & Bengtson, 1991), positive
and negative qualities of relationships with grown children
were associated with parental well-being. Prior research re-
vealed that parents experienced more negative quality rela-
tionships with children suffering problems than with
successful children (Birditt et al., 2010), and poor quality
relationships were linked to diminished well-being (Milkie
et al., 2008). In this study, variations in relationship quality
accounted for the effect of successful children on well-
being but not the effect of children with problems. Parents
may feel proud and derive benefits from low conflict and
high regard with successful grown children. Relationship
quality may not explain diminished well-being when off-
spring suffer problems because multiple factors lead to
poorer well-being among these parents such as the drain on
their resources, shameful interactions with other parents,
and their own sense of failure as a parent.
Limitations and Future Directions for Research
We recognize several limitations of the study that provide
important directions for future research. The cross-sectional
design and self-report nature of data may yield biases. Par-
ents who are higher in psychological well-being may view
their offspring as more successful and may also report bet-
ter relationships, simply because they feel better about their
lives. In addition, the study included a limited definition of
well-being, pertaining to parents' depressive symptoms and
FINGERMAN ET AL.

life satisfaction. Indeed, although the regressions and pre-
dictors were significant, the proportion of variance ac-
counted for in those analyses was small to modest. Studies
that incorporate a wider range of positive aspects of well-
being, such as feelings of pride and self-acceptance, might
find stronger associations between offspring's successes
and parental well-being. Moreover, longitudinal research is
necessary to verify causal ordering of parental well-being
and offspring experiences.
By examining parents' perceptions of multiple children,
this study revealed that children have differential associa-
tions with parents' well-being. This study examined chil-
dren's successes as well as their problems. Children's
successes were associated with more positive and lower
negative relationship qualities, whereas children's problems
were associated with poorer quality relationships that may
generate conflicts and stress for parents. Parental well-being
reflected these combined factors across multiple children.
Previous studies have examined problems in the aggregate
or parents' perceptions of one child. This study included
multiple grown children and helped substantiate that grown
children's distress may be contagious. Grown children's
problems may harm parental well-being, even when other
children in the family are thriving.
