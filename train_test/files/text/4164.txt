Introduction: Language, Culture, and
Communication
It is a truism that language and culture are intertwined.
Language is the carrier of culture and culture the substance of
language: The two cannot exist separately (Romaine, 2000).
To succeed in communicating with others, one must be aware
of the culture behind the language used in communication
(Tanck, 2004). When speaking a foreign language, the issue
of culture becomes critical. English as Foreign language
(EFL) learners, especially those with languages different and
distant from English psychologically, culturally, phonologi-
cally, and syntactically, may struggle when attempting to
communicate in English. Non-proficient language learners
are not only jeopardized by their imperfect language knowl-
edge but obstructed by their inadequate knowledge of culture.
To compensate for their lack of knowledge, EFL learners may
fall back on their own linguistic cultural reservoir, translating
utterances from their mother tongue and applying their own
cultural rules when communicating in English (Al-Eryani,
2007; Lauper, 1997). This might lead to pragmatic errors that
could result in misunderstanding and embarrassment or
pragma-linguistic failure (Riley, 1989; Thomas, 1983; Umale,
2011). Hence, it is essential to integrate pragmatics in the
teaching and learning of a foreign language. To avoid break-
downs in communication, it is important to explore how
culture and linguistic background can affect one's utterances
or speech acts to raise student and instructor awareness of this
and help them address it appropriately. This is especially
important nowadays as "cross-cultural communication is
becoming an integral part of life, with globalization and rapid
advances in new technology" (Umale, 2011, p. 19). In addi-
tion, employment opportunities in the local and global market
increasingly demand good language proficiency and commu-
nicative ability. Therefore, teaching pragmatic rules in a way
that they would involve communication strategies and speech
acts will give students the English knowledge and communi-
cative competence that will secure good job placements after
graduation.
The present study aimed to explore how well Omani col-
lege English language learners communicate in English and
what factors could have influenced them. Taking the refusal
speech act as a case in point, it sought to discover how Omani
EFL college students used English when refusing requests,
invitations, offers, and suggestions presented to them in a set

Refusal Strategies Among Omani EFL
Students
Rahma Al-Mahrooqi1 and Khalsa Al-Aghbari1
Abstract
The main objective of this study was to investigate the refusal speech act among Omani EFL college students. It examined
how they refused in various situations and whether their responses were appropriate in terms of culture and accurate in
terms of language. Forty-one English as foreign language (EFL) learners completed a Discourse Completion Test (DCT)
consisting of 12 scenarios by supplying written refusals to three requests, three suggestions, three invitations, and three
offers. Students' responses were rated by two professors: one a native English speaker and the other not. A convenient
sampling procedure was employed. The findings indicated that students' responses were largely inappropriate and inaccurate.
Further examination showed that they were heavily influenced by the students' culture, many being mere translations of
refusal responses in Omani Arabic. Others were inappropriate because they were too direct, due to students' lack of
knowledge of the role of social status when issuing refusals to a person of high status. Language mistakes were mainly in the
sentence structure, which affected the meaning clarity. Findings suggest that, to help students become better communicators
in English, it is important to teach them directly the most common speech acts, especially those they might frequently use in
their everyday conversations with professors and classmates.

of scenarios. The scenarios were organized in a way that
would involve interlocutors of differing social status: high (a
boss, for example), same (friend or colleague), and low (an
employee or a housekeeper). The study examined whether
the responses were appropriate pragmatically and accurate
linguistically and the factors that could have influenced
them.
Literature Review: Speech Acts
The intimate connection between language and culture is
clearly reflected in people's everyday language use as it por-
trays different functions or speech acts. For this reason,
studying speech acts has been the focus of much recent
research. It is well known in sociolinguistics that Austin
(1962) and Searle (1969) were the first researchers to speak
of speech act theory. They maintained that speech acts are
meaningful forms of behavior regulated by rules. Hence, a
speech act is an utterance carrying a language function that is
based on performance not on description (Baleghizadeh,
2007). To put it more succinctly, a speech act is an action
performed by an utterance (Belza, 2008; Bruti, 2006). The
utterance usually carries an attitude, and this attitude corre-
sponds to the speech act being performed (Bach, n.d.). The
listener's understanding of the attitude leads to understand-
ing the speech act.
Studying speech acts is similar to studying sentence mean-
ings, because sentences can express speech acts (Searle, 2001).
Speech acts are either direct or indirect, and people usually use
indirectness either to show more politeness (Bruti, 2006) or to
make their speech more interesting (Justovà, 2006). This must
be clear to the hearer, who needs to understand the message to
respond appropriately (Justovà, 2006).
For a speech act to be culturally appropriate, knowledge of
the spoken language's culture is crucial (Umale, 2011). This
is an important aspect of communicative competence and
speakers of a given language need to know how to perform
speech acts to function appropriately. Although speech acts
are universal in themselves, different cultures express them
differently (Al-Kahtani, 2005; Miller, 2005; Morsi, 2010) as
cultural factors have an important impact on their frequency,
distribution, and functions. According to Al-Khateeb (2009),
"cultural factors play a role in the development of diverse
ways of talking and communicating" (p. 20).
Examples of speech acts include requesting, offering,
apologizing, complimenting, congratulating, sympathizing,
and refusing, all of which are language-based actions.
Because this article focuses on refusals as produced by
Omani EFL college students, the following section reviews
the literature on this particular speech act.
Refusal as a Speech Act
Refusal is a "face-threatening act that tends to disrupt har-
mony in relationships" (Umale, 2011, p. 18). Due to its
sensitivity, a refusal can be perceived differently between
speaker and listener. It is a negative response to another speech
act issued in the form of a request, invitation, or suggestion
(Abdul Sattar, Che Lah, & Suleiman, 2011). Due to their
nature, refusals can affect people's relationships adversely if
perceived as impolite or uncaring.According to Umale (2011),
refusals may damage the positive face of the speaker and
threaten the negative face of the listener. Therefore, the author
continues to "mitigate threats to face" caused by refusals,
speakers can use politeness strategies (p. 19).
Soepriatmadji (2010) and Umale (2011) maintain that
several social factors may affect refusal strategies, such as
gender, age, setting, topic, educational level, status, and
interlocutors. Social status and social distance between inter-
locutors are major factors and thus figure quite frequently in
studies focusing on refusal. They affect the directness or
indirectness of refusals. Of course the direct way of refusing
an invitation is simply to say "no," "I can't," "I will not," or
"I don't think I can" (Abed, 2011). Beebe, Takahashi, and
Uliss-Weltz (1990) found that, when speaking with people
from the same social status, U.S. native speakers of English
used indirect refusal while native speakers of Japanese used
indirect refusals with people of higher status and direct refus-
als with people of a lower status. In Malaysia, Malays were
found to avoid the use of direct refusals with people of higher
status, but use the direct "no" when refusing people of equal
or the same status (Abdul Sattar et al., 2011). As for gender,
it was found that although males use more direct refusals
than females, refusal strategies based on gender are usually
not apparent in other areas (Abed, 2011; Soepriatmadji,
2010). Nelson, Al-Batal, and El Bakry (2002) found that
both Egyptian and U.S. males and females use direct refus-
als, but Egyptian men tend to be more direct than U.S. males
and females of both countries.
Indirect refusal strategies include, among other things,
showing regret, giving excuses, making suggestions, and
promising later acceptance (Abed, 2011). According to
Al-Kahtani (2005), U.S. native speakers of English tend to
use regret when refusing people from a higher or equal status
more often than giving excuses, while Saudis and Japanese
use more explanations and give more excuses. Arabs and
Japanese also show gratitude when refusing an invitation or
request. Tanck (2004) confirms that native speakers of
English use regret followed by an excuse. Malaysians, how-
ever, tend to use the regret strategy when refusing in all situ-
ations, regardless of social status.
As for speakers of English as a foreign or second lan-
guage, refusal strategies have been found to be influenced by
the culture of their native language (Al-Eryani, 2007; Lauper,
1997). Lauper found that Spanish English speakers' use of
refusal strategies was similar in both English and Spanish
and that these differed from English speakers' strategies.
Yemeni English language learners' refusal strategies were
not as direct as Americans', and they often offered reasons
for the refusal. Moreover, Yemeni learners' refusals showed,
Al-Mahrooqi and Al-Aghbari 3
in addition to linguistic competence in English, evidence of
native culture influence (Al-Eryani, 2007).
English speakers from Ghana were found to use excuses
often when refusing familiar or unfamiliar people because it is
impolite in Ghanaian culture to refuse without offering an
excuse (Safro, 2011). Safro also indicated that people in close
relationships sometimes refuse by asking clarification questions
or repeating the request or suggestion. However, Delin and
Tavil (2010) found that Turkish learners of English use direct
refusals with close relatives and friends but indirect ways with
distant relationships. Their main indirect refusal strategies were
giving excuses, showing regret, or showing regret followed by a
statement about future or past acceptance.
As seen above, culture can have a salient effect on students'
communication skills and their use of various speech acts. If
cultural transfer takes place, then miscommunication or a break-
down in communication can take place. Because the main
objective of learning English as a foreign language is to com-
municate with people with whom students do not share a mother
tongue, it is essential that they master the art of communicating
appropriately and accurately while observing English's prag-
matic and linguistic rules. This study attempts to examine the
ways in which Omani EFLcollege students expressed refusal in
various situations and whether these were appropriate in terms
of culture and accurate in terms of language.
Method
Participants
The population of the study came from the Department of
English in a higher education institution in Oman. The study
employed a convenient sampling procedure. It was adminis-
tered in spring 2012 and fall 2013. Forty-one EFL learners (22
males and 19 females) agreed to participate after being
informed in class of the study's objectives and of the voluntary
nature of participation. Participants majored in English and
belonged to three different departments: Education, English
Arts, and Translation. Being in the second, third, fourth, and
fifth years of their programs, their English levels ranged from
low-intermediate to high-intermediate based on their linguistic
performance in a reading test. The reading test was used with
other groups of students from previous years, and it proved to
be a good measure of their linguistic competence. The authors
decided on the validity and reliability of the instrument used by
having a panel of researchers checking it and then piloting it in
one of the reading classes. The authors then counted the
responses of all the participants to the test as offered below and
examined them according to their linguistic accuracy and prag-
matic appropriacy.
Material and Procedure
ADiscourse Completion Test (DCT) was administered to par-
ticipants. It consisted of 12 scenarios requiring participants to
supply a written refusal to three requests, three suggestions,
three invitations, and three offers. Each of the three scenarios
in each group sought a refusal to a person of a different status.
The first required a refusal to an equal status person, the sec-
ond to a higher status person, and the third to a lower status
person. The DCT was designed by the researchers and based
on the work of Beebe et al. (1990) and Umale (2011). The
appendix details the scenarios that participants were pre-
sented with.
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed by describing the refusal strategies
employed and checking their linguistic accuracy and prag-
matic appropriateness. The authors also explored how sensi-
tive learners were to the role of social status in issuing
refusals and listed pragma-linguistic errors characterizing
the collected refusals.
The refusals were rated by two professors in the
Department of English at Sultan Qaboos University--native
and non-native speakers of English--who judged the
responses based on accuracy and appropriateness. In some
cases, the professors reacted to the responses by stating why
they sounded inappropriate. A non-native speaker rater was
employed for two reasons: (a) to be able to clearly see
whether the Arabic culture influences responses especially
when the non-native rater placed a check mark besides a
pragmatically inappropriate response and (b) to cross check
the ratings of both professors.
According to Umale (2011), arriving at a correct refusal
strategy entails either a statement of reason (e.g., "I cannot
come because I have to take my wife to the hospital") or
regret (e.g., "I am sorry"). Therefore, the responses given by
EFL learners were divided into two idea units and were
assigned a value of either 1 for a reason or 2 for regret.
Following Beebe et al. (1990), Nelson et al. (2002), and
Umale (2011), the refusals in this study were also described
according to the categories presented in Table 1. It is impor-
tant to note that the expressions supplied in the table repre-
sent real refusals taken from our data.
The analysis addressed the following issues:
1. Types of strategies used by EFL learners to refuse:
direct/indirect.
2. How the learners addressed refusals to interlocutors
of distinct social status.
3. Pragma-linguistic failure: length and content.
4. Native speakers' ratings of response accuracy.
Results
Types of Strategies Used in Refusals
As stated earlier, the researchers observed that two types of
strategies were used in the refusals produced by the Omani
4 SAGE Open
learners: direct and indirect. We address direct responses first
and then move to the indirect strategies employed.
Direct strategies.Because the study explored refusals in
requests, offers, suggestions, and invitations, responses var-
ied in terms of being direct or indirect across the four groups.
Results suggest that Omani EFL learners use more direct
refusals of requests with people of low status because 23
(56%) direct refusals surfaced when an employee asked his
boss to leave work early. Examples of direct refusals include
"No, don't go now. I will let you leave the office early today,"
"No, you have to finish your job, then deal with your per-
sonal issues," and "I cannot! We have some work to do."
There were nine (22%) direct refusals to a person of equal or
higher status. This paralleled the direct refusals to an offer
made by a person of higher status. Refusals that surfaced
with people of equal and higher status included "No, I don't
have money. Actually, I invite you, feed you to give me 500
RO [Omani Rials] for this month" and "I cannot, my boss!
This weekend, I must play much [play a match] and be with
my parents at home."1
In invitations, six (15%) direct refusals appeared with
friends (e.g., "No, I don't like magic shows. I don't like to go
outside my house" and "I cannot go tonight. Maybe next
time"). Six learners directly refused invitations from friends,
while only three directly refused invitations made by a per-
son of higher or lower status. Examples of these include "No,
no, I am sorry. Please accept my apologies. I have other
issues" (addressed to a boss) and "Actually, I cannot come
because I have planned something to do," which was a
response given to an employee who invited their boss for
their daughter's birthday.
Offers, as kind social gestures, are special speech acts that
demand careful responses. Direct refusals may break up rela-
tions. They may also be considered as negative, impolite, and
abrupt. The researchers observed that learners were quite
insensitive to the status of the person who made the offer.
They used 22 (54%) direct refusals with a higher status per-
son (e.g., "No, my old beautiful car; that is impossible. Thank
you for the offer" and "Not my old car. It is very very pre-
cious. I can't let it go. It is a treasure for me"). Eight (20%)
direct refusals were given to the same status and six (15%) to
low status people.
Learners sounded abrupt, rude, and/or extremely negative
toward refusals that interfered with their life or future. They
used 25 (61%) direct refusals with low status people and 20
(49%) with friends. Examples of the direct refusals included
"No, Sir! My future is to become a scientist rather than a
football player," "No, I cannot! It is not a career in our societ-
ies. It is just a hobby" (both heard in a response to a careers
counselor suggesting a football career), and "No, I am fine! I
can handle the situation. There is no need to go to Malaysia."
Although learners sounded careful when refusing sugges-
tions made by a higher status person, we suspect that the sce-
nario affected the responses to a large extent.
Table 2 illustrates the number and percentage of direct
refusals along with the status of the person to whom the
refusal was issued:
Although Umale (2011) argued that "Omanis used the
highest number of direct strategies in refusing requests and
offers" (p. 26), this study found that Omani learners used
direct refusals with offers and suggestions. The highest num-
ber of direct refusals surfaced in answers to a low status
person.
Indirect strategies. Participants were also observed to refuse
requests, offers, invitations, and suggestions indirectly. This
happened when they regretted acceptance, gave reasons,
showed consideration for the interlocutor's feelings, pre-
sented a philosophical view, wished they were able to fulfill
the request, and gave promises of future acceptance. In some
cases, two of the above strategies were used simultaneously,
but with a variation in the order they came in.
The researchers observed that Omani learners tended to
use 52 (42%) regrets to requests for money as they used 24
(19%) to a person of the same status and 19 (15%) to a per-
son with a higher status (e.g., "Unfortunately, I am sorry. I
don't have this amount of money" and "Sorry, you cannot
because we have a lot of works needed to be done today").
They tended to use the word "wish" when refusing requests
for money, as in "I wish I could give you, but I seriously
don't have more than I need." In the collected responses,

six (5%) learners showed solidarity with and consideration
for the feelings of a requestor of the same or higher status.
However, none gave any promises for future help with
money. Ten (8%) responses involving reason and consider-
ation for the interlocutor's feelings were given to a person
of the same or higher status (e.g., "Sir, I have to go some-
where that time. I can come next weekend if you want"). In
contrast to responses to a same status person, only one (1%)
wish was given to a person of higher status. The researchers
observed that with a person of low status, learners neither
showed any consideration for the interlocutor's feelings nor
expressed wishes for, or promises of, future acceptance.
The majority of responses were direct refusals or regrets.
Respondents sometimes also used a variety of reasons to
reject requests, such as "I have lots of tasks assigned for
you. I cannot let you go." One philosophical statement in
response to a request made by a person of low status was
"work is work!"
Because invitations are kind gestures that bring people
together, learners were observed to be extremely polite when
refusing them. The majority of responses (46 or 37%) showed
consideration for the inviter's feelings, regardless of the sta-
tus of the person involved. And 20 (16%) responses showed
considerations for, and appreciations of, kind invitations
given to a higher and lower status person. Examples included
"I would be glad to come," "I appreciate your invitation," "It
is an honor, but I have been already invited to have lunch
with one of my friends," and "Oh what a nice thing!"
However, the researchers observed that, with friends, learn-
ers tended to use more regrets, such as "I am sorry, but I
really don't feel like it." One response involved a philosophi-
cal statement made in response to an invitation from an
employee--"I don't think it would be appropriate if I
attended your daughter's birthday party." Moreover, a total
of eight (7%) wishes were made in response to these
invitations.
Offers are other types of acts that help solidify relations
because the person who offers help, money, or anything in
this way shows kindness. Similarly, the responses given to
offers varied greatly. When the housemaid spoiled a new
shirt while ironing, learners responded with "Don't worry
because I have many other shirts" and "Oh it is ok I have
others and I don't need it." They used 36 (29%) responses
showing consideration for the interlocutor's feelings with a
higher status person (e.g., "Thank you but I don't want to sell
my car," and "Thank you. There is no need to do that").
Suggestions can be regarded as intruding statements. A
person suggesting a particular matter can be taken as inter-
fering with the interlocutor's business. Repetition, a new
technique to refuse a suggestion, was introduced in refusing
suggestions (e.g., "Malaysia!!! I heard about it. It is a good
idea to go there but not now because we are in the beginning
of the semester"). One notable difference in responses was
the huge number of philosophical responses (n = 12, or 10%)
produced to suggestions, such as "Soccer does not buy you a
great life but science will".
EFL learners used a variety of strategies to refuse.
However, we observed that they used regret more when
responding to requests, and they showed consideration for
the interlocutor's feelings when refusing offers.
The role of status. One of the objectives of this study was to
explore whether Omani EFL learners were aware of the
social status of their interlocutor when issuing refusals to
requests, offers, invitations, and suggestions. Although the
overall figures for direct refusals show sensitivity toward the
status of the interlocutor, the researchers were rather con-
cerned about the high number of direct refusals produced in
offers where high status people were concerned. In fact,
many responses were more negative, abrupt, and rude than
the literature would suggest.
However, the current study lends some support to Umale's
(2001) finding that "Omanis use more caution and care in
dealing with people of higher status" (p. 28). We observed
that we had substantial figures for "consideration of the
interlocutor's feelings" across the four groups. In a number
of responses, the learners revealed no difference in respond-
ing to a friend or a person of a low status.

Pragma-linguistic failure. Culture plays a crucial role in deter-
mining expected refusals produced by Omani EFL learners to
requests, offers, invitations, and suggestions. The researchers
observed that a large number of respondents transferred their
Arabic speech habits into English. In Arabic, people tend to
give elaborate and detailed refusals so that the feelings of the
interlocutor are not hurt--for example, "I am sorry. I can't let
you go before you finish your work (Table 3). However, if
you are in a hurry, at least finish the urgent tasks that I've
given you." However, this may not work with English speak-
ing cultures, which often demand directness and clear
responses. Moreover, a lengthy response such as the one
above might well result in pragma-linguistic failure.
Omanis are sometimes described as being overly friendly
(Umale, 2001). Therefore, when refusing invitations, offers,
and suggestions, they might sound "obsequious" (to use
Umale's term); they use many introductory statements before
they state their refusal (e.g., "I appreciate your invitation, but
I am sorry I really can't come. Wish your daughter a happy
birthday"). In a number of cases, a reason for refusing the
offer or invitation is given.
The study suggests that Omani EFL learners use a variety
of refusal strategies. In many cases, two strategies are often
used together (i.e., regret followed by reason, consideration
of the interlocutor's feelings followed by reason, a wish fol-
lowed by a reason). Umale (2001) argued that this semantic
formula is very prevalent in Arabic. Omanis using Arabic are
likely to express regret or consideration for the interlocutor's
feelings followed by reasons for a refusal (e.g., "Thanks dear
but I hope to excuse me because I have an appointment with
my love," "That is a good idea but I like to keep the old
things because they are very precious," and "Sorry dear, my
mother does not feel good, I need to stay at home to take care
of her. Again sorry"). This formula is quite common in the
responses EFL learners used as refusals in the present study.
Moreover, many also expressed a wish then refused the offer
or invitation. For example, one learner responded with "I
would be glad to attend, but I am really busy at this time."
According to Umale, native English speakers tend to express
regret and give reasons. They rarely show consideration for
the interlocutor's feelings or express a wish, which means
that the EFL learners featured here transferred their Omani
cultural norms and acts of speech to express refusals in
English. This transfer might result in pragma-linguistic fail-
ure and may hinder smooth communication with native
speakers of English.

Native and non-native speaker's ratings of responses. The refus-
als given by EFL learners were rated by native and non-
native speakers of English who were asked to judge the
responses based on two criteria: accuracy of language and
appropriateness to English speaking culture(s). They were
asked to place a check or cross in the cell indicating their
choice (accurate vs. inaccurate; appropriate vs. inappropri-
ate) and supply a comment. It was noted that the raters failed
to comment on all the responses given. Table 4 illustrates the
number of responses in terms of accuracy and appropriate-
ness, as judged by the two speakers. It is important to note
that there are about 129 refusals in each of the four types.
Table 4 reveals that the non-native speaker of English
considered many EFL learners' responses to be inaccurate.
This may suggest low proficiency in English on the part of
EFL learners. Many faulty statements involving grammati-
cal and structural errors were produced (e.g., "No, no. I will
but another ones. That's fine," "That's kind of you but I have
lots of work to so I am sorry," and "No, I don't want I have
no time"). However, the native speaker rater marked the
majority of refusals as grammatically accurate. The research-
ers observed that the native speaker rater generally focused
more on what could be accepted as "spoken" language in
terms of conveying the meaning rather than as "written"
responses, which were full of mistakes in tenses, punctua-
tion, conjunctions, and structures. For example, a refusal
such as "Sorry, I cannot. Also, I have my own responsibili-
ties and duties" was considered to be accurate by the native
speaker despite having an inappropriate conjunction in the
statement. We also observed that the native speaker over-
looked the fact that these responses included many repeti-
tions and faulty prepositions and punctuations such as "Oh!
I am sort, this weekend I am going to my homeland" and "I
would if I could but I can't because I will be busy up to my
nose during the weekend."
In terms of appropriateness, the non-native speaker judged
many responses as informal with no positive feeling (e.g.,
"Sorry my boss, I've already planned to do something in the
weekend"), too direct/negative (e.g., "Sorry my friend, I
can't lend you because I have a lot of responsibilities"),
abrupt/odd (e.g., "No, I don't have money. Actually, I invite
you, feed you in order to give me 500 OR for this month"),
and repetitive, as in "I really really understand your problem,
but unfortunately I don't have that amount." In terms of
appropriateness, the researchers observed that the non-native
speaker of English, similar to the Arab respondents, was
influenced by Arabic norms and speech acts when rating
responses. He viewed statements that considered the inter-
locutor's feelings and those that expressed regret to be appro-
priate. For instance, he passed statements such as "I would
really like to help you, but I have other commitments during
the weekend, and I would like be very busy," and "You know
that I would love to help you, but I am busy in this weekend."
Statements that expressed direct refusal or listed a reason
were considered inappropriate by the non-native speaker.
The native speaker of English marked fewer statements as
inappropriate, revealing moderate competency on the part of
EFL learners with regard to pragma-linguistic competence.
She considered direct refusals such as "No, I can't because I
don't have that amount of money," to be too brusque; "Am
sorry I can't. I have other plans and I can't ruin them," to be
offensive; and "Sorry but I am very busy," to be curt.
Discrepancies, though strikingly salient, can be attributed
to two facts: (a) the native speaker has lived long enough in
Oman to know that Omanis are generally too friendly to
express direct refusals. Thus, she accepted responses express-
ing regret, reason and consideration of an interlocutor's feel-
ings and overlooked status in many scenarios and (b) the
native speakers' focus was observed to be more on the mes-
sage expressed by the refusal.
Discussion and Conclusion
Omani EFL learners used a variety of pragma-linguistic strate-
gies to address refusals across the four different situations
(requests, invitations, offers, and suggestions). To illustrate, it
was observed that Omani EFL learners used a few direct refus-
als. However, they used a large number of indirect refusals,
which express reason, regret, wish, and other indirect strategies.
The highest number of direct refusals was found in refusing
requests and suggestions. While requests are often hard to fulfill,
suggestions may sound like intrusion into others' business.
Hence, requests and suggestions received some negative, abrupt,
and curt refusals. It was surprising to the researchers to find that

Omani EFL learners used direct refusals with people who are
higher in status than themselves. These may potentially cause a
threat to "face" when used with a boss or when negotiating a
business deal. Direct instruction on the importance of social sta-
tus when addressing refusals in English might increase aware-
ness about accuracy and fluency related to refusals in English.
Most likely, EFLlearners'Arabic cultures played a crucial role
in influencing the refusal strategies used. Many of these strategies
result in mere transfer of L1 speech norms to L2, causing mis-
communication, misunderstanding, and offense. Normally, peo-
ple ensure that they maintain face inAsian cultures, avoid putting
interlocutors into embarrassing predicaments, and respond
politely to friends and people of a lower status. Omani EFLlearn-
ers greatly impinged on social status when they use direct refusals
to an offer made by a person of a higher status. This warrants
examination of other factors that may result in blunt and harsh
refusals such as the low key and high key content of the message
(Hall,1976).Thisisespeciallyimportantbecausethetypeofoffer
can cause anger, frustration, or interference with one's business.
There were apparently large differences in the ratings of
accuracy and appropriateness by the native and non-native
speaker raters. The researchers observed that the native speaker
rater considered the majority of the learners' responses to be
grammatically and pragmatically acceptable. As pointed out
earlier, these responses may sound acceptable when spoken but
not written. To illustrate, a response that drops the third person
singular s may not hinder understanding; however, it is cer-
tainly ungrammatical. The native speaker considered this to be
fine. However, the non-native speaker, who had received for-
mal instruction on the English language, was more meticulous
in judging the accuracy of these written responses. Responses
lacking the third person singular s, and those using wrong verb
tenses or those with misplaced prepositions and punctuation
were marked wrong by the non-native speaker. The differences
between the native and non-native are due to differences in
their level of tolerance for errors, their training, teaching expe-
riences, and their linguistic orientations. We were expecting a
difference, but the degree of difference was not anticipated.
Although this study provided a number of emergent under-
standings in an area that is largely under-researched in the
Omani context, it had a number of limitations that should be
acknowledged. First, the collected refusals were written
responses and not natural reactions. It is very important to note
that respondents are likely to have given different refusals
when facing real situations. Second, the study did not inter-
view the raters to collect more data or check why responses
were judged in the way they were. We believe that the raters'
explanations may have differed from those we have provided,
which could have revealed the actual reasons behind the high
percentage of accurate and appropriate responses rated by the
native speaker compared with the non-native speaker's rat-
ings. However, despite these concerns, the current study does
suggest that EFL learners make serious pragmatic errors in
issuing refusals. Moreover, it maintains that the refusals they
use are not sensitive to the social status of the interlocutors.

Note
1. Many of the responses supplied by English as foreign lan-
guage (EFL) learners are syntactically flawed and grammati-
cally incorrect. A discussion of the accuracy of these responses
as per the ratings of a native and non-native speaker will fol-
low. Thus, for credibility reasons, we have written down the
inaccurate responses without correcting them.
