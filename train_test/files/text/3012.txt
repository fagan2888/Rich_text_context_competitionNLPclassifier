Lipid-Lowering Therapy Based
on Updated NHANES III Data

Background: When the National Cholesterol Educa-
tion Program Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP II) guide-
lines were published, National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey III data for 1988 to 1991 were used to
estimate the number of Americans requiring lipid-
lowering therapy based on ATP II cut points. However,
the guidelines recommend using clinical judgment to de-
termine whether to initiate drug therapy in individuals
whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels re-
main above treatment goals with diet therapy but below
the initiation level for drug therapy.
Methods: We analyzed updated (1988-1994) National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III data, based
on a sample of 6796 adults aged 20 years and older, to
estimate the numbers of American adults with an el-
evated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and re-
quiring drug therapy using cut points vs clinical judg-
ment as specified in ATP II guidelines.
Results: Assuming a 10% low-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol reduction with diet, an estimated 10.4 million
American adults require drug therapy based on ATP II
cut points. If we include individuals for whom the guide-
lines recommend clinical judgment, the estimate in-
creases to 28.4 million. The largest increase occurs in in-
dividuals without known coronary heart disease but with
2 or more risk factors: from 5.5 to 17.5 million. These
high-risk individuals have low-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol concentrations similar to those in patients with
coronary heart disease.
Conclusions: Since the ATP II guidelines were pub-
lished, clinical judgment has been informed by abun-
dant clinical trial evidence establishing the safety
and benefit of lipid-lowering therapy. The large number
of individuals at high risk for coronary heart disease em-
phasizes the need for cost-effective therapy to extend
treatment to the greatest number of individuals who may
benefit.

WHEN THE second
Adult Treatment
Panel (ATP II) of
the US National
Cholesterol Educa-
tion Program published its report1,2 in
1993, data from phase 1 (1988-1991) of
the third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) were
used to estimate the prevalence of hyper-
cholesterolemia as defined in the revised
guidelines,3 based on the ATP II cut points
for initiation of diet and drug therapy
(Table 1). In addition to the cut points,
however, ATP II recommends the use of
"clinical judgment that weighs potential
benefit,possiblesideeffects,andcosts"2(pO-8)

in individuals whose low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (LDL-C) level remains
above goal with diet therapy but below the
initiation level for drug therapy. Adult
Treatment Panel II includes in this cat-
egory individuals with coronary heart dis-
ease (CHD) whose LDL-C level remains
at 100 to 129 mg/dL (2.59-3.35 mmol/L),
individuals without CHD who have 2 or
more risk factors listed in the ATP II pri-
mary prevention algorithm (Table 2) and
an LDL-C level of 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36-
4.13 mmol/L), and middle-aged or older
individuals without CHD who have less
than 2 risk factors and an LDL-C level of
160 to 189 mg/dL (4.14-4.89 mmol/L).
Since the ATP II guidelines and the
previous NHANES III report on hyper-
cholesterolemia were published, evi-
dence-based clinical judgment has been
influenced by new clinical trial data on
the safety and benefits on CHD morbid-

ity and mortality of lipid-lowering therapy with
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase
inhibitors (statins) in both primary and secondary pre-
vention and in patients with both milder and more
severe LDL-C elevations. Included in these studies
were patients who would not have qualified for drug
therapy using a strict application of the ATP II cut
points yet who were shown to benefit from lipid-
lowering drug therapy. During this time, clinical judg-
ment has also been influenced by the availability of
more cost-effective agents. In addition, updated
NHANES III data for 1988 to 1994 are available. Using
these updated data, which are in the public domain for
analysis, we reexamined the prevalence of elevated
LDL-C levels in American adults and estimated the
range of individuals who might require drug therapy
based on the ATP II guidelines, interpreted conserva-
tively by using only the cut points and more broadly
by applying clinical judgment as the guidelines recom-
mend.
RESULTS
In the 155.0 million individuals represented in this analy-
sis, the mean total cholesterol level was 204.1 mg/dL (5.28
mmol/L) and the mean LDL-C level was 127.4 mg/dL
(3.29 mmol/L). Of these individuals, an estimated 107.1
million did not have CHD and had less than 2 risk fac-
tors, 38.5 million did not have CHD and had 2 or more
risk factors, and 9.4 million had known CHD. Overall,
the LDL-C level was above the level recommended in the
ATP II guidelines in 28.8% of individuals (160 mg/dL
[4.14 mmol/L] in individuals without CHD who had
2 risk factors, 130 mg/dL [3.36 mmol/L] in indi-
viduals without CHD who had 2 risk factors, and 100
mg/dL [2.59 mmol/L] in individuals with CHD). In each
risk category, most individuals had normal to mildly el-
evated LDL-C levels (Figure 1). The mean LDL-C level
in the respective risk categories was 122.6 mg/dL (3.17
mmol/L), 139.5 mg/dL (3.61 mmol/L), and 132.8 mg/dL
(3.43 mmol/L).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
DATA SOURCE
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III was
conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics from
October 1988 to October 1994 in two 3-year phases (1988-
1991 and 1991-1994). Each phase was designed to repre-
sent the entire civilian noninstitutionalized US popula-
tion aged 2 months and older. This survey included an
oversampling of the 2 largest racial minorities, African
Americans and Mexican Americans, known to be under-
represented in previous NHANES databases; children aged
2 to 5 years; and persons aged 60 years and older. As noted,
data on the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia from the
first phase were published previously3; the present study
includes data from both phases for computation of more
accurate and recent national estimates because individual
phase estimates may be highly variable. A detailed descrip-
tion of the survey design and methods has already been pub-
lished.4
Basic demographic characteristics were obtained for
all persons (N = 39 695) selected to participate in NHANES
III. The survey consisted of an interview followed by a physi-
cal examination. Overall, 33 994 participants completed the
household questionnaire; 18 825 were adults aged 20 years
and older. Information on cardiovascular disease history--
including questions on family history of heart attack; his-
tory, knowledge, and treatment of high blood pressure, high
blood cholesterol, and diabetes; and history of heart at-
tack, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, and congestive heart
failure--was obtained. Responses to the Rose question-
naire for angina pectoris5 were also included. Current and
past use of cigarettes and lipid-lowering, antihyperten-
sive, and hypoglycemic medications was also assessed, based
on the participant's self-report.

pressure measurement and venipuncture to obtain blood

6-hourfastingsample(nonmorningsubgroup).Forthepres-
entanalysis,weuseddatafromthe8476adultsaged20years
or older assigned to the morning subgroup.
LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS
Lipids
All lipid analyses were based on a single venous blood sample
collected at the mobile examination center or at the home
of persons who were unable to go to the mobile examina-
tion center. Measurements of serum total cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride
levels were made in milligrams per deciliter at The Johns
Hopkins University Lipid Research Clinical Laboratory, Bal-
timore, Md. This laboratory was standardized according to
the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control­National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Lipid Standardization Pro-
gram.6
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were cal-
culated in people with triglyceride levels of 400 mg/dL or
less (4.52 mmol/L) by using the equation developed by
Friedewald et al7 (all units are milligrams per deciliter):
LDL-C = total cholesterol - [HDL-C + (triglyceride/5)].
Participants in the morning subsample who had fasted
less than 9 hours, had triglyceride levels greater than 400
mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L), had hemophilia, or had type 1 dia-
betes mellitus were excluded from this analysis because their
LDL-C level could not be accurately calculated (n = 1680
[19.8%]). Thus, prevalence estimates were based on 6796
subjects with valid LDL-C levels. Because all treatment de-
cisions in the ATP II guidelines are based on LDL-C level,
the analyses in this study are based on LDL-C level.
Plasma Glucose
The plasma glucose level was measured after an overnight
fast lasting 9 to 24 hours in individuals who had not been

category whose LDL-C level was at or above the initiation
level for diet or diet plus drug therapy, assuming LDL-C
reductions of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% with diet alone, are
shown in Table 3. However, the total number of indi-
viduals who require therapy would be higher, because the
sample includes individuals whose LDL-C level has al-
ready been lowered by diet or diet plus drug therapy and
might otherwise be above the initiation level. Lipid-
lowering drug therapy was estimated to be used by 4.5 mil-
lion individuals: 1.4 million (1.3%) with less than 2 risk
factors, 2.1 million (5.4%) with 2 or more risk factors, and
1.0 million (11.1%) with CHD. The LDL-C treatment goals
recommended by the ATP II guidelines were achieved in
72.8%, 30.2%, and 16.6% of the respective risk categories.
Clearly, the broader application of clinical judgment
asdefinedintheguidelineswouldleadtoamarkedincrease
in the number of individuals who might require lipid-
lowering drug therapy (Figure 2 and Table 3), although
theactualnumberofindividualsforwhomtherapywould
beappropriatewouldbesomewherebetweentheextremes
defined by conservative and broader applications of clini-
caljudgment.Themoststrikingincreasewithabroaderap-
plication is in the group with 2 or more risk factors. Of the
38.5millionindividualswithoutCHDwhohave2ormore
risk factors, 23.0 million have an LDL-C level of 130 mg/
dL or greater (3.36 mmol/L), ie, above the level recom-
mendedbytheATPIIguidelines.Withinthisriskcategory,
estimatesofthenumberofindividualsrequiringdrugtherapy
using a "conservative" approach range from 3.7 million
(9.7%) based on 15% LDL-C reduction with diet to 11.1
million (28.8%) based on 0% LDL-C reduction with diet.
Usingabroaderapplicationofclinicaljudgment,therespec-
tive numbers requiring drug therapy range from 13.7 mil-
lion (35.6%) to 23.0 million (59.8%).
Because the group of individuals without CHD and
with 2 or more risk factors represents the largest number
of individuals potentially requiring therapy, we further ex-
amined whether individuals in this group with "border-
line"LDL-Clevelsof130to159mg/dL(3.36-4.13mmol/L)
diagnosed as having diabetes and who were assigned to the
morning subsample. Analysis of samples was conducted at
the Diabetes Diagnostic Laboratory, University of Missouri­
Columbia.4
Blood Pressure
Blood pressure was measured on 2 separate occasions fol-
lowing the American Heart Association standardized pro-
tocol.8 In the present analysis, we used the average of 3 blood
pressure measurements obtained at the participant's home
and 3 obtained at the mobile examination center.
CLASSIFICATION OF RISK CATEGORIES
Participants were classified according to the ATP II risk cat-
egories: (1) with CHD, defined in this analysis as a self-
reported history of a heart attack or a positive score for an-
gina on the Rose questionnaire; (2) without CHD and with
2 or more risk factors(see subsection titled "Risk Stratifi-
cation in Primary Prevention"); and (3) without CHD and
with less than 2 risk factors.
RISK STRATIFICATION
IN PRIMARY PREVENTION
In participants without CHD, risk factors were defined as
in the ATP II algorithm for primary prevention (Table 2),
with the following qualifications reflecting NHANES III data
collection: family history of premature CHD was defined as
a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or offspring) of ei-
ther sex who had a heart attack before the age of 50 years,
and patients were considered to be diabetic if they had ever
been told by a physician that they had diabetes and were tak-
ing insulin or oral diabetes medication or if they had a fast-
ing plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL or greater (7.0
mmol/L).9
Per the ATP II guidelines, a risk score was calculated
for each individual by adding 1 point for each risk factor
present and subtracting 1 point from the total score if the
HDL-C level was 60 mg/dL or greater (1.55 mmol/L), eg,
a 52-year-old woman who was a current smoker with hy-
pertension would have a risk score of 2, but if she also had
a high HDL-C level, the risk score would be 1.
DATA ANALYSIS
Sampling weights reflecting the survey design were used
to produce national estimates.10 Adjustments for nonre-
sponse in NHANES III did not reveal evidence of nonre-
sponse bias (T. M. Ezzati, MS, and M. Khare, MS, unpub-
lished data, 1992). The weights were adjusted to reduce
bias from nonresponse at the interview and examination
stages. The weighted total was 154 987 478 adults aged 20
years or older as of October 1991, the midpoint of NHANES
III. To assess potential nonresponse bias for LDL-C level,
the weighted distributions of individuals in the selected
sample, individuals in the interviewed sample, and indi-
viduals with and without LDL-C values in the fasting morn-
ing subsample for various demographic and health-
related factors were obtained.11 To estimate the total number
of participants with an elevated cholesterol level who might
require lipid-lowering drug therapy, we considered 4 sce-
narios in which dietary intervention would uniformly re-
duce LDL-C levels by 0%, 5%, 10%, or 15%, which was con-
sistent with previous analyses conducted by Sempos et al.3
In addition, we examined the percentage reduction in LDL-C
level required by individuals qualifying for drug therapy
according to the ATP II guidelines, assuming a 10% reduc-
tion in LDL-C level with dietary therapy. A sensitivity analy-
sis was performed on the range of 20% to 50% LDL-C re-
duction needed to achieve ATP II goals by aggregating people
across CHD risk strata. Computer software (Microsoft Ac-
cess 97; Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Wash) was used to per-
form descriptive analyses and summation of weights based
on various criteria. For quality control, the analyses were
reconducted using additional software (Statistical Export
and Tabulation System; US Department of Health and Hu-
man Services, National Center for Health Statistics, Hy-
attsville, Md).

were at lower "global" risk for CHD events if all major risk
factorswereexaminedthantheindividualswithLDL-Clev-
els of 160 mg/dL or greater (4.14 mmol/L). The sub-
group of individuals with 2 or more risk factors and with
an LDL-C level of 160 mg/dL or greater (4.14 mmol/L)
was similar in size to the subgroup with an LDL-C level of
130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36-4.13 mmol/L) (11.1 and 12.0 mil-
lion, respectively), and a comparison of the risk factors in
the ATP II algorithm for primary prevention suggests that
a large number of individuals in the borderline LDL-C sub-
group,whowouldnotqualifyfordrugtherapyunderastrict
application of the ATP II cut points, have a global risk for
CHD that is at least as high as many in the subgroup with
higher LDL-C levels (Table 4). Also, there were ethnic
differencesinthedistributionofindividualsbetweenLDL-C

(3.36 mmol/L), 47.8% had an LDL-C level of 160 mg/dL
or greater (4.14 mmol/L) and 52.2% had an LDL- C level
of 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36-4.13 mmol/L), and of the esti-
mated2.0millionAfricanAmericans,50.9%and49.1%were

mg/dL(3.36-4.13mmol/L),comparedwith42.1%whohad
an LDL-C level of 160 mg/dL or greater (4.14 mmol/L).
Although broader application of clinical judgment
would require treating more high-risk patients, the vast
majority of individuals with an elevated LDL-C level have
only mild elevations and, therefore, need a 30% reduc-
tion or less in LDL-C level to achieve the appropriate ATP
II goal (Figure 3). Assuming a 10% reduction in LDL-C
level with diet and treating the maximum number of in-
dividuals potentially qualifying for drug therapy under
the ATP II guidelines, 94.3% of individuals without CHD
and with less than 2 risk factors, 91.4% of individuals
without CHD and with 2 or more risk factors, and 68.7%
of individuals with CHD would reach the LDL-C goal rec-
ommended by the ATP II guidelines with only a 30% or
less reduction in LDL-C level. Treating only individuals
qualifying for drug therapy by a strict application of the
ATP II cut points, 85.0%, 72.7%, and 36.1% of individu-
als in the respective risk categories would achieve goal
with 30% or less reduction in LDL-C level. Figure 4 il-
lustrates the estimated percentages of individuals in the
3 risk categories combined who can achieve LDL-C goals
recommended by the ATP II guidelines with broader ap-
plication of clinical judgment at different LDL-C reduc-
tions. With 20% and 30% reductions in LDL-C level,
66.8% and 86.4% of US adults, respectively, would reach
ATP II goals. However, the increment in the percentage
of patients reaching the goal is small beyond an LDL-C
reduction of 35% to 40%.
COMMENT
The ATP II guidelines were farsighted in their inclusion
of clinical judgment instead of a narrow application of

arbitrary cut points. Since the ATP II guidelines and the
previous NHANES III report on prevalence of hypercho-
lesterolemia were published in 1993, clinical trial data
have dramatically changed evidence-based clinical judg-
ment. When the guidelines were developed, most of the
published clinical trials of lipid-lowering drug therapy
used agents with low efficacy and adverse effect profiles
that limited compliance; because these agents were not
shown to improve total mortality, questions remained
about the relative benefit vs risk of using drug therapy
to lower elevated LDL-C levels. Accordingly, the ATP II
guidelines recommended the use of clinical judgment to
weigh "potential benefit, possible side effects, and costs"
in determining whether to initiate drug therapy in pa-
tients with LDL-C levels between the cut points for diet
and drug therapy.2(pO-8) Subsequently, however, the use
of statin therapy has become widespread, and long-term
data have become available, establishing the safety and
enhanced efficacy of the statins. In 5 major clinical event
trials enrolling almost 31 000 patients, the benefits of
statin therapy on CHD morbidity and mortality have
been demonstrated in primary and secondary preven-
tion in patients with a broad range of LDL-C levels be-
fore therapy. Patients with severely elevated LDL-C
levels were examined in the secondary prevention Scan-
dinavian Simvastatin Survival Study12 with simvastatin
and in the primary prevention West of Scotland Coro-
nary Prevention Study13 with pravastatin sodium. Pa-
tients with mildly to moderately elevated LDL-C levels
were studied in the secondary prevention Cholesterol and
Recurrent Events trial14 and in the Long-Term Interven-
tion With Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease study,15 both
with pravastatin, and in the primary prevention Air Force/
Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study16 with
lovastatin. In all these studies, statin therapy produced
a consistent reduction in relative risk for coronary events
without any significant increase in noncardiovascular
death, cancer, myopathy, or transaminase elevations
greater than 3 times normal. Similarly, in angiographic
trials of statin therapy, CHD progression has been shown
to be significantly reduced with therapy not only in pa-
tients with severely elevated LDL-C levels but also in pa-
tients whose LDL-C level was only mildly to moderately
elevated.17 Taken together, these clinical trial results have
demonstrated that patients with a range of CHD risk pro-

files, including an LDL-C level that would be consid-
ered "average," benefit from aggressive lipid-lowering
therapy. While the responsible application of clinical judg-
ment also encompasses the exclusion of individuals for
whom drug therapy is inappropriate, the clinical trial evi-
dence supports the extension of treatment to individu-
als who would not be treated with lipid-lowering drugs
under a strict application of the ATP II cut points for drug
therapy.
The majority of patients with CHD do not have mark-
edly elevated LDL-C levels.18 Because too often the first
symptom of CHD is sudden death, primary prevention
in high-risk patients is essential. However, a conserva-
tive application of the ATP II guidelines would mean that
the majority of people at risk would not be treated. This
analysis of NHANES III data estimates that of the 9.4 mil-
lion individuals with documented CHD, 7.3 million (78%)
have an LDL-C level less than 160 mg/dL (4.14 mmol/L)
(Figure 1, C); the majority of individuals who do not have
known CHD but who have multiple risk factors and are,
therefore, at increased risk for developing CHD symp-
toms also have an LDL-C level less than 160 mg/dL (4.14
mmol/L). At the time the guidelines were developed, it
was reasonable to assume that pharmacological therapy
for primary prevention in patients with multiple risk fac-
tors and an LDL-C level of 160 mg/dL or greater (4.14
mmol/L) would provide greater relative risk reduction
than in patients with an LDL-C level less than 160 mg/dL
(4.14 mmol/L). However, this assumption was not borne
out in the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Pre-
vention Study,16 conducted in 6605 men and women with-
out any coronary or vascular disease who had an LDL-C
level of 130 to 190 mg/dL (3.36-4.91 mmol/L) or 125 to
129 mg/dL (3.23-3.35 mmol/L) with a total cholesterol­
HDL-C ratio greater than 6; the mean LDL-C level was
150 mg/dL (3.88 mmol/L), and 83% of the study popu-
lation would not have qualified for drug therapy accord-
ing to a conservative application of the ATP II guide-
lines. Average LDL-C reduction with lovastatin, 20 to 40
mg/d, was 25%, and similar relative risk reductions were
reported across all tertiles of baseline LDL-C level (142
mg/dL [3.67 mmol/L], 143-156 mg/dL [3.67-4.05
mmol/L], and 157 mg/dL [4.05 mmol/L]).
If the relative risk reductions achieved with statin
therapy are similar in individuals with an LDL-C level
of 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36-4.13 mmol/L) and 160 mg/dL
or greater (4.14 mmol/L), then the decision to initiate
drug treatment should be based on the absolute risk for
CHD. Among individuals with 2 or more risk factors, more
individuals with an LDL-C level of 130 to 159 mg/dL
(3.36-4.13 mmol/L) have at least 3 risk factors com-
pared with individuals with an LDL-C level of 160 mg/dL
or greater (4.14 mmol/L). The present guidelines fo-
cus heavily on LDL-C level rather than the absolute risk
of the individual; after trichotomizing patients into 3 broad
risk categories, the ATP II guidelines use LDL-C level as
the basis for determining the initiation and monitoring
the effectiveness of treatment. However, the absolute risk
for a CHD event may be higher in an individual with 3
risk factors and an LDL-C level less than 160 mg/dL
(4.14 mmol/L) than in an individual with no other risk
factors and an LDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL (4.91
mmol/L). In the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention
Study, men aged 55 to 64 years without a previous myo-
cardial infarction had CHD event rates of 1% or less per
year if they only had a high LDL-C level, whereas their
event rates were higher than 2% per year if they also had
any one of the following risk factors: minor electrocar-
diographic abnormalities, preexisting vascular disease,
current smoking, HDL-C level less than 43 mg/dL (1.11
mmol/L), hypertension, or family history of premature
CHD.19 As we look ahead to ATP III, the inclusion of
absolute risk, as in other national20 and international21
guidelines, may help identify high-risk patients.
Limitations of the NHANES III data likely led to un-
derestimation of the number of high-risk patients. In-
ferences from survey participants to the entire popula-
tion are limited by potential sources of bias. Consistent
with observations of other investigators,22 various de-
mographic and clinical characteristics were similarly dis-
tributed between persons assigned to the morning sub-
group and the interviewed sample. However, people with
hypertension, a high cholesterol level, and diabetes were
underrepresented among responders to the LDL-C analy-
sis, partly because diabetic patients taking insulin were
excluded from the morning subgroup, which requires a
9-hour fasting blood sample. Data from self-reported
smoking may also have a potential for underreporting and
recall bias, particularly among ethnic minorities, older
persons, and people with a lower socioeconomic sta-

tus.23 These subgroups are more likely to have CHD risk
factors than the entire population. Furthermore, per-
sons with CHD may have been misclassified in the ab-
sence of a validating clinical diagnosis or if the presence
of other atherosclerotic disease was not ascertained.24
Overall, these biases likely resulted in an underestima-
tion of the numbers of people in the higher-risk groups
who require therapy to lower LDL-C levels under the ATP
II guidelines.
Although the ATP II algorithm for primary preven-
tion weights all risk factors equally, recent studies sug-
gest that some risk factors, such as diabetes or low HDL-C
level, may confer greater risk than other risk factors. Dia-
betic patients without known CHD have been reported
to have the same incidence of fatal or nonfatal myocar-
dial infarction as patients with known CHD.25 Among in-
dividuals with 2 or more risk factors, a larger percent-
age of those with an LDL-C level of 130 to 159 mg/dL
(3.36-4.13 mmol/L) have diabetes than of those with an
LDL-C level of 160 mg/dL or greater (4.14 mmol/L)
(Table 4), and as noted the actual number of diabetic in-
dividuals is likely higher than the estimates reported
herein because individuals unable to provide a fasting
blood sample have been excluded. In the Scandinavian
Simvastatin Survival Study26 and the Cholesterol and Re-
current Events trial,27 patients with diabetes had the high-
est absolute risk for CHD events, and lipid-lowering
therapy produced greater absolute risk reductionsforclini-
cal events in diabetic patients than in patients overall.
Despite the increased incidence of diabetes among Mexi-
can Americans, high-risk Mexican Americans, most of
whom have an LDL-C level of 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36-
4.13 mmol/L) (Table 4), may be less likely to be recom-
mended for drug therapy than other ethnic groups. Be-
cause of the importance of diabetes as a risk factor and
because most diabetic patients eventually die of CHD, the
American Diabetes Association recommends more
aggressive treatment of hyperlipidemia in patients with
diabetes.28
Another important risk factor is HDL-C level. Par-
ticularly in individuals with a borderline LDL-C level, a
low HDL-C level may greatly increase the risk for CHD.
In the Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study,29
conducted in patients with CHD and a mildly to mod-
erately elevated LDL-C level of 115 to 190 mg/dL (2.97-
4.91 mmol/L), patients with a baseline HDL-C level less
than 35 mg/dL (0.9 mmol/L) had more angiographic
progression than patients with a higher HDL-C level; how-
ever, patients with a low HDL-C level also had more ben-
efit from lipid-lowering therapy with fluvastatin so-
dium. In a number of trials that used diverse methods to
identify high-risk subgroups that may receive the most
benefit from therapy, including ultracentrifugation to mea-
sure intermediate-density lipoprotein and very LDL,30 LDL
density measurement,31 apolipoprotein and lipoprotein
particle assessment,32 and LDL-C cut points in patients
with hyperapolipoprotein B-100,33 the high-risk group
was also characterized by a lower HDL-C level. In the Air
Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study,
conducted in patients with below-average HDL-C levels
(45 mg/dL [1.16 mmol/L] in men and 47 mg/dL
[1.22 mmol/L] in women), benefit on first major coro-
nary event was similar across all tertiles of baseline
HDL-C level, although patients in the lowest tertile
were at the highest absolute risk; among patients as-
signed placebo, an estimated 6.7% with baseline HDL-C
levels of 34 mg/dL or less (0.89 mmol/L) had events
compared with 4.1% with HDL-C levels of 40 mg/dL or
greater (1.02 mmol/L).16 Although overall relative
risk reductions in the statin trials were impressive, the
wide range of absolute risk reductions and numbers
needed to treat highlight the importance of treating pa-
tients according to their absolute risk.34 Relatively
simple tools to assess the absolute risk for CHD are
available, such as the most recent Framingham algo-
rithm, which includes categorical variables for age,
blood pressure, and diabetes and smoking status, as
well as LDL-C and HDL-C levels.35 Targeting therapy to
those most likely to receive benefit would also allow for
more cost-effective treatment.
With the accumulation of clinical trial evidence, the
issues surrounding lipid-lowering drug therapy have
shifted from scientific questions regarding efficacy to cost-
effectiveness concerns.36 With the increasing number of
individuals who may benefit from therapy comes the
growing problem of allocation of resources. To extend
treatment to the largest number of individuals who might
benefit, algorithms have been devised to maximize cost-
effectiveness by targeting high-risk patients, improving
treatment efficacy (including increased compliance to diet
and exercise), and minimizing the cost of therapy.34 The
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is sponsoring
a large prospective study that should provide better in-
formation not only on the predictive value of newer di-
agnostic tests for detecting subclinical CHD but also on
the cost-effectiveness of these tests. Another important
means of reducing the cost of treatment is to match
therapy to the patient by using less expensive agents when
they are sufficient to achieve LDL-C targets. The subset
of individuals without known CHD but with multiple risk
factors and mildly to moderately elevated LDL-C levels
represents the largest segment of the US adult popula-
tion needing lipid-lowering therapy by either a broad or
a conservative application of clinical judgment. Most of
these patients need only moderate LDL-C reductions to
achieve goal: based on the latest NHANES III data, 91%
of patients with multiple risk factors but without docu-
mented CHD could reach the ATP II goal with only a 30%
or less reduction in LDL-C level. Advances in evidence-
based medicine, which extend the benefit of lipid-
lowering therapy to patients with mildly to moderately
elevated LDL-C levels, provide the necessary basis for in-
formed clinical judgment as recommended in the ATP
II guidelines.

Figure 1. Distribution of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels: A, in individuals without coronary heart disease (CHD) who had less than
2 risk factors; B, in individuals without CHD who had 2 or more risk factors; and C, in individuals with CHD. The LDL-C level was normal to mildly
elevated in most individuals in each risk category. Individuals with "borderline" LDL-C levels would be considered for drug therapy using a broader
application of clinical judgment as recommended in the Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP II) guidelines. Bar height indicates the number of individuals
in each LDL-C range. To convert LDL-C levels from milligrams per deciliter to millimoles per liter, multiply milligrams per deciliter by 0.02586.
