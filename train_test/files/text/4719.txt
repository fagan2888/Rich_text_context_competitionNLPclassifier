ABSTRACT
Combined anti-retroviral therapeutic drugs effectively
increase the lifespan of HIV-1-infected individuals who
then have a higher prevalence of HAND (HIV-1 associated
neurocognitive disorder). Soluble factors including HIV-1
proteins released from HIV-1-infected cells have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of HAND, and particular
attention has been paid to the HIV-1 Tat (transactivator of
transcription) protein because of its ability to directly excite
neurons and cause neuronal cell death. Since HIV-1 Tat
enters cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and since
endolysosomes play an important role in neuronal cell life
and death, we tested here the hypothesis that HIV-1 Tat
neurotoxicity is associated with changes in the endolyso-
some structure and function and also autophagy. Following
the treatment of primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons
with HIV-1 Tat or as controls mutant-Tat or PBS, neuronal
viability was determined using a triple staining method.
Preceding observations of HIV-1 Tat-induced neuronal cell
death, we observed statistically significant changes in the
structure and membrane integrity of endolysosomes,
endolysosome pH and autophagy. As early as 24 h after
HIV-1 Tat was applied to neurons, HIV-1 Tat accumulated
in endolysosomes, endolysosome morphology was affected
and their size increased, endolysosome membrane integrity
was disrupted, endolysosome pH increased, specific
activities of endolysosome enzymes decreased and auto-
phagy was inhibited, as indicated by the significant
changes in three markers for autophagy. In contrast,
statistically significant levels of HIV-1 Tat-induced neur-
onal cell death were observed only after 48 h of HIV-1 Tat
treatment. Our findings suggest that endolysosomes are
involved in HIV-1 Tat-induced neurotoxicity and may
represent a target for therapeutic intervention against
HAND.

INTRODUCTION
More than 40 million people worldwide are infected with
HIV-1, and combined anti-retroviral therapeutic drugs have
effectively increased the lifespan of people living with HIV.
Increased as well is the prevalence of HAND (HIV-1-associated
neurocognitive disorder) with recent epidemiological studies
indicating that the prevalence of HAND in the U.S.A. is greater
than 50% of HIV-1-infected people (Ellis et al., 2010; Heaton
et al., 2010). Clinically, HAND represents a set of conditions
ranging from subtle neuropsychological impairments to
profoundly disabling HIV-associated dementia. Although the
underlying mechanisms for HAND pathogenesis are not fully
understood, soluble factors including HIV-1 viral products and
pro-inflammatory mediators released from the infected glia
and monocytes have been implicated (Ghafouri et al., 2006;
King et al., 2006; Wallace 2006; Ances and Ellis, 2007). Among
the viral products, HIV-1 Tat (transactivator of transcription)
protein has been shown to be neuroexcitatory and neurotoxic,
and it continues to be implicated as a causative agent in HAND
(Sabatier et al., 1991; Weeks et al., 1995; Haughey et al., 1999;
Nath et al., 2000; Perez et al., 2001; King et al., 2006; Buscemi
et al., 2007b; Agrawal et al., 2012).
HIV-1 Tat is a non-structural transcriptional regulator
essential for the replication of HIV-1. The first exon of HIV-1
Tat encodes the first 72 amino acids and the second exon
encodes another 14­32 amino acids. Tat1­72
is sufficient for
transactivation, which requires the arginine-rich domain of Tat
between amino acid residues 49 and 57. Nanomolar concentra-
tions of HIV-1 Tat have been reported in sera of HIV-1-infected
patients, but these levels are almost certainly underestimated,

given how avidly HIV-1 Tat binds to proteins and cells
(Westendorp et al., 1995; Xiao et al., 2000). HIV-1 Tat can be
transported across the blood­brain barrier from the systemic
circulation (Kim et al., 2003; Banks et al., 2005), can be secreted
by infected macrophages and microglia, and has been detected
in brain of patients with HIV-1-associated dementia
(Westendorp et al., 1995; Ellis et al., 2000; Nath, 2002).
HIV-1 Tat enters neurons via receptor-mediated endocytosis
involving CD26 (Gutheil et al., 1994), CXCR4 (CXC chemokine
receptor type 4) (Xiao et al., 2000), heparin sulphate proteoglycans
(Tyagi et al., 2001) and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) receptor-
related proteins (Liu et al., 2000; Vendeville et al., 2004; King et al.,
2006; Deshmane et al., 2011). Endocytosis is a very rapid and early
event, which results in the accumulation of HIV-1 Tat in
endolysosomes from which it can be released into the cytoplasm
and uptaken into the nucleus (Vives et al., 1997; Liu et al., 2000;
Caron et al., 2004), most probably through the mechanisms
involving the high H+ gradient maintained by vacuolar H+-ATPase
(Vendeville et al., 2004). The endolysosome system is very dynamic,
and lysosomes and other acidic sub-cellular compartments are
involved in endocytosis and autophagy (Jeyakumar et al., 2005;
Nixon and Cataldo, 2006). Endosomes and lysosomes process
proteins and other materials that are endocytosed, whereas
autophagy predominantly process cytosolic proteins.
Neurons are highly polarized long-lived post-mitotic cells,
which possess an elaborate endolysosome system critical for
the maintenance of neuronal function (Nixon and Cataldo,
1995, 2006). Increasingly, endolysosome dysfunction has
been implicated in neuronal damage and in the pathogenesis
of a variety of neurological disorders including AD
(Alzheimer's disease), Parkinson's disease and HAND
(Gelman et al., 2005; Spector and Zhou, 2008; Zhou and
Spector, 2008). Here, we tested the hypothesis that HIV-1 Tat
induces neuronal damage by affecting the structure and
function of endolysosomes. We report that HIV-1 Tat
enlarged endolysosomes, disrupted endolysosome membrane
integrity, elevated endolysosome pH, decreased specific
activities of endolysosome enzymes and inhibited autophagy.
Our findings suggest that the disturbed structure and
function of endolysosomes play an early and important role
in HIV-1 Tat-induced neuronal damage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Hippocampal neuron primary cultures
Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared
from embryonic day 18 Sprague­Dawley rats as described
previously (Buscemi et al., 2007) using a protocol approved
by the University of North Dakota Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee adherent with the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication number 80­23).
Pregnant dams (embryonic day 18) were killed by
asphyxiation with CO2
. The fetuses were removed, decapitated,
and meninges-free hippocampi were isolated, trypsinized and
plated on to 35-mm poly-D-lysine-coated glass-bottom tissue
culture dishes. Neurons were grown in the NeurobasalTM
medium with L-glutamine, antibiotic/antimycotic and B27
supplement, and were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2
for
10­14 days at which time they were used for the experimenta-
tion. Typically, the purity of the neuronal cultures was greater
than 95% as determined by neuronal staining with mouse anti-
NeuN or goat anti-MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2)
antibodies (Millipore); astrocytes were identified using a mouse
anti-GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) antibody (Sigma).
Neurons were treated either with HIV-1 Tat1­72
(100 nM, a gift
from Dr Avindra Nath, Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine, Baltimore, MD, U.S.A.), mutant Tat (TatD31­61
, 100 nM)
or PBS as vehicle.
Neuronal cell viability assay
Neuronal cell viability was determined using a triple staining
method as described previously (Buscemi et al., 2007).
Neurons were stained with Hoechst 33342 (10 mg/ml),
ethidium homodimer-1 (4 mM) and calcein (1 mg/ml).
Hoechst 33342, which labels DNA, was used as a marker for
identifying condensed nuclei characteristic of apoptotic cell
death. Cells dead or dying as a result of loss of membrane
integrity were unable to exclude ethidium homodimer-1 dye.
Cells were considered viable when cytoplasm was stained
with green fluorescence after the cleavage of the non-
fluorescent calcein AM (acetoxymethyl ester) to calcein.
Fields were chosen randomly and at least five images from
five separate fields of culture dishes for every experimental
condition were taken with our Axiovert 200 M fluorescence
microscope (Zeiss) and filter-based imaging system. The
number of dead or dying neurons (ethidium-labelled red
nuclei and blue-condensed nuclei without green cytoplasmic
staining) and total neuron numbers were counted manually.
More than 900 neurons were counted per experimental
condition. Neuronal viability was reported as a percentage of
total neurons.
Measurement of endolysosome pH
Endolysosome pH was measured using a ratio-metric
lysosome pH indicator dye (LysoSensor Yellow/Blue DND-
160 from Invitrogen); a dual excitation dye that permits pH
measurements in acidic organelles independently of dye
concentration. Neurons were loaded with 2 mM LysoSensor
for 5 min at 37°C. Light emitted at 520 nm in response to lex
at 340 and 380 nm was measured for 20 ms every 30 s using
a filter-based imaging system (Zeiss). The ratios of light
excited at 340/380 nm and emitted at 520 nm were con-
verted to pH using a calibration curve established using
10 mM of the H+/Na+ ionophore monensin, and 20 mM of the
H+/K+ ionophore nigericin dissolved in 20 mM Mes, 110 mM
KCl, and 20 mM NaCl adjusted to pH 3.0­7.0 with HCl/NaOH.

Living cell imaging
The morphology of endolysosomes in living neurons was
determined using a LysoTracker dye. After treatments,
neurons were loaded with LysoTracker Red DND-99 (50 nM,
Invitrogen) and calcein AM (1 mg/ml, Invitrogen) for 30 min
at 37°C. Fields were chosen at random and at least five
images from every experimental condition were acquired by
confocal microscopy (Olympus). The sizes of endolysosomes
(LysoTracker) were analysed with the particle-analysing
program in Image J software. For measurement of Tat
endocytosis, neurons were incubated with FITC­Tat (100 nM,
AnaSpec) for 1 day at 37°C, followed by loading of
LysoTracker Red DND-99 (50 nM) and Hoechst 33342
(10 mg/ml) for an additional 30 min. Images were taken with
an Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope (Zeiss).
Immunocytochemistry
Neurons were fixed with cold methanol (220°C) for 10 min,
washed with PBS, blocked with 5% goat serum, and
incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies targeting
EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1; 1:500, rabbit polyclonal,
Santa Cruz) or LAMP1 (lysosome-associated membrane
protein-1; 1:500, rabbit polyclonal, Sigma). After washing
with PBS, neurons were incubated with Alexa FluorH 546-
conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen). Neurons
were examined by confocal microscopy (Olympus). Controls
for specificity included staining neurons with primary
antibodies without fluorescence-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies (background controls) and staining neurons with only
secondary antibodies.
Endolysosome membrane permeability
Endolysosome membrane permeability was determined by mea-
suring the leakage of endolysosome fluorescent dye Lucifer
Yellow CH (Invitrogen). Neurons were incubated with
Lucifer Yellow (100 mg/ml) for 16 h, followed by incubation
with Tat at 37°C for 1 and 2 days. Levels of dye inside of neurons
were detected by confocal microscopy (Olympus).
Immunoblotting
Neurons were lysed with RIPA buffer (Pierce) containing
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). After centrifugation
(14000 g for 10 min at 4°C), supernatants were collected,
and protein concentrations were determined with a DC
protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins (10 mg)
were separated by SDS/12% PAGE, and, following transfer,
PVDF membranes (Millipore) were incubated overnight at
4°C with anti-EEA1 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti-LAMP1 (1:1000, Sigma), anti-acid phosphatase (1:1000,
mouse monoclonal, Abcam), anti-cathepsin B (1:500, mouse
monoclonal, Sigma), anti-cathepsin D (1:1000, mouse mono-
clonal, Sigma), anti-LC3 (light chain 3) b (1:1000, rabbit
polyclonal, Abcam), anti-Atg5 (autophagy-related gene-5;
1:2000, mouse monoclonal, Millipore) or anti-p62 (1:1000,
rabbit polyclonal, Sigma) antibodies; anti-b-actin (1:10000,
mouse monoclonal, Abcam) antibody was used as a gel-
loading control. The blots were developed with enhanced
chemiluminescence, and bands were visualized and analysed
by LabWorks 4.5 software on a BioSpectrumH imaging System
(UVP). Quantification was performed by densitometry and the
results were analysed as total integrated densitometric
volume values (arbitrary units).
Measurement of activities of endolysosome
enzymes
Enzyme activities of acid phosphatase were determined using an
acid phosphatase assay kit (Sigma); a luminescence-based assay
that uses 4-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate (Chen et al.,
2010). Enzyme activities of cathepsins D and B were determined
using assay kits (BioVision); fluorescence-based assays that used
cathepsin D or cathepsin B preferred substrates labelled with
MCA (Chen et al., 2010). Enzyme activities were expressed as
absorbance per 10 mg of protein. Specific activities of each
enzyme were expressed as a ratio of enzyme activity to protein
levels as determined by immunoblotting.
Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as means¡S.E.M. Statistical signifi-
cance for multiple comparisons was determined by one-way
ANOVA plus a Tukey post hoc test. P,0.05 was considered to
be statistically significant.
RESULTS
In order to compare the effects of HIV-1 Tat on neuronal
damage and the structure and function of endolysosomes, we
needed to first determine the time course and extent to
which HIV-1 Tat decreased neuronal viability. HIV-1 Tat1­72
induced significant amounts of neuronal cell death starting
from 48 h of treatment (n55, P,0.05) with a maximum of
50% neuronal cell death (n55, P,0.001) after the treatment
for 96 h (Figure 1). These data were consistent with previous
studies that have shown similar neurotoxic effects of HIV-1
Tat (Kruman et al., 1998; Haughey et al., 1999; Bonavia et al.,
2001; Aksenov et al., 2003; Buscemi et al., 2007; Eugenin
et al., 2007). No statistically significant increases in neuronal
cell death were observed with either mutant TatD31­61
or PBS,
consistent with previous reports that this deletion mutant of
Tat is not directly toxic to neurons (Buscemi et al., 2007).
In neurons and other cells, HIV-1 Tat uses receptor-
mediated endocytotic mechanisms (Liu et al., 2000; Vendeville
et al., 2004; King et al., 2006) to enter cells where HIV-1 Tat
accumulates first in endolysosomes. Since the basic region of

amino acids 49­57 of HIV-1 Tat is required for binding to
membrane receptor proteins (Sabatier et al., 1991) and
exerting its neurotoxic effects (Weeks et al., 1995), we used
a FITC-labelled Tat47­57
to determine first the extent to which
HIV-1 Tat accumulated in endolysosomes in neurons. After
incubating neurons with the FITC-labelled HIV-1 Tat47­57
(FITC-
Tat), we observed significant intracellular accumulation of
FITC-Tat, which was mainly compartmentalized in endolyso-
somes as identified with LysoTracker dye (red, Figure 2A).
Since alterations in the structure and function of
endolysosomes have been implicated in the neuropathogen-
esis of a number of neurological disorders, we next
determined the extent to which HIV-1 Tat-affected endoly-
sosome morphology. In living neurons, we identified endolyso-
somes with LysoTracker, and we found that treatment
with HIV-1 Tat for 1 and 2 days increased significantly
(n515, P,0.05) the size of endolysosomes (Figures 2B and 2C).
Treatment with mutant Tat did not affect endolysosome
morphology (L. Hiu, X. Chen and J.D. Geiger, unpublished data).
Using immunocytochemistry methods, we found that endo-
somes labelled with EEA1 antibody and lysosomes labelled with
LAMP1 antibody were relatively small and evenly distributed in
neurons treated with PBS or mutant Tat, but were markedly
enlarged and clumped together in HIV-1 Tat-treated neurons
(Figure 2B, middle and bottom panels).
Figure 2 HIV-1 Tat-altered the structure of neuronal endolysosomes
(A) HIV-1 Tat is accumulated in endolysosomes of primary cultured neurons. FITC-labelled Tat47-57
peptide (100 nM, green) was co-
localized with endolysosomes (red, LysoTracker) and DAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; blue) was used for staining nuclei.

manner
Significant amounts of neuronal cell death were observed after 2-day
incubation with HIV-1 Tat (100 nM) and reached a maximal level of 50% cell
death by the fourth day. No significant neuronal cell death was observed in
neurons treated with either mutant Tat or PBS (n55, *P,0.05 and
***P,0.001).

The observation that HIV-1 Tat alters endolysosome
morphology led us to determine next the extent to which
HIV-1 Tat-affected endolysosome function. Since pH is critical
for endolysosome function, we determined the extent to which
HIV-1 Tat-affected endolysosome pH using LysoSensor dye,
which permits ratio-metric assessment of pH changes in acidic
organelles. We found that HIV-1 Tat, but not mutant Tat
treatment for 1 or 2 days elevated significantly (n520,
P,0.001) endolysosome pH in cultured hippocampal neurons
(Figure 3). As endolysosome pH affects endolysosome enzyme
activity, we next determined the protein levels and activity of
endolysosome enzymes as evaluations of endolysosome
function. Treatment of neurons with HIV-1 Tat for 1 or 2 days
increased significantly protein levels of the endolysosome
enzymes acid phosphatase (Figure 4A, n54, P,0.01 at 1 day
and n54, P,0.05 at 2 days), cathepsin B (Figure 4C, n54,
P,0.05) and cathepsin D (Figure 4E, n54, P,0.01 at 1 day
and P,0.05 at 2 days). However, the specific activity levels of
Figure 3 HIV-1 Tat-elevated endolysosome pH in primary cultured neurons

Tat (100 nM) treatment for 1 and 2 days elevated significantly endolysosome
pH (n520).

acid phosphatase (Figure 4B), cathepsin B (Figure 4D) and
cathepsin D (Figure 4F) were decreased significantly (n54,
P,0.001) in HIV-1 Tat-treated cultures.
Endolysosome dysfunction has been implicated in initiating
stress pathways that lead to cellular dysfunction and death
(Roberg and Ollinger, 1998; Turk et al., 2002; Guicciardi et al.,
2004; Kroemer and Jaattela, 2005; Kurz et al., 2008). Here, we
determined the extent to which HIV-1 Tat-affected endoly-
sosome membrane integrity using Lucifer Yellow dye (Yang
et al., 1998). We found that while control neurons displayed a
discrete punctate pattern of perinuclear fluorescent staining
(Figure 5), HIV-1 Tat-treated neurons displayed increased
endolysosome membrane leakage as evidenced by diffuse
fluorescent staining (Figure 5) in the cytoplasm.
Endolysosomes also function to control autophagy, a
process important for normal physiological functions of
neurons. Dysfunctions in autophagy have been implicated in
the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders
(Wong and Cuervo, 2010) including HAND (Alirezaei et al.,
2008b; Alirezaei et al., 2008a; Spector and Zhou, 2008; Zhou
and Spector, 2008; Zhu et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2011). Based
on the findings that HIV-1 Tat disrupts autophagy in immune
cells (Van Grol et al., 2010), we determined the extent to
which HIV-1 Tat-affected autophagy in primary cultured
hippocampal neurons. Three markers were used to evaluate
the status of autophagy; MAP1 LC3 which regulates the ini-
tiation process of autophagy, Atg5 which regulates the
elongation process of autophagy, and p62 which inhibits
autophagy. We found that HIV-1 Tat treatment decreased
significantly protein levels of LC3 (Figure 6A, n54, P,0.05 at
2 day treatment) and Atg5 (Figure 6B, n54, P,0.05 at 1 day
and P,0.01 at 2 days treatment), but increased significantly
protein levels of p62 (Figure 6C, n54, P,0.05 at 1 and 2 days
treatment).
DISCUSSION
Combined highly active anti-retroviral therapeutic drugs
have increased dramatically the lifespan of people now living
with AIDS. However, this increased lifespan is accompanied by
increased prevalence of HAND, which affects up to 50% of
people with HIV-1 infection (Ellis et al., 2010; Heaton et al.,
Figure 5 HIV-1 Tat-disrupted endolysosome membrane integrity
Endolysosome membrane integrity was evaluated by measuring the leakage
of Lucifer Yellow dye. Control neurons displayed a discrete punctate
fluorescent staining pattern in perinuclear regions with no fluorescence in
cytoplasm (left panel), whereas neurons treated with HIV-1 Tat for 1 day
displayed endolysosome membrane leakage as indicated by diffusion of
fluorescence into cytoplasm (right panel, bar 510 mm).
Figure 6 HIV-1 Tat-inhibited autophagy
Autophagy was estimated by measuring protein levels of LC3, Atg5 and p62.
(A) HIV-1 Tat (100 nM) decreased significantly protein levels of LC3. (B) HIV-
1 Tat (100 nM) reduced significantly protein levels of Atg5. (C) HIV-1 Tat
(100 nM) increased significantly protein levels of p62. Representative
Western blots and quantitative data from each of proteins are shown, and
actin was used as a loading control (n54).

2010). The underlying mechanisms for HAND pathogenesis
are not fully understood, but one mechanism that appears to
be important yet relatively understudied is the involvement
of endolysosomes. Disturbed endolysosomes have been noted
in brain of HIV-1-infected individuals (Gelman et al., 2005;
Spector and Zhou, 2008; Zhou and Spector, 2008), but the
mechanisms for these pathological observations are not
known. Since neurons are long-lived post-mitotic cells with
extreme polarity, they possess an elaborate endolysosome
system that contains hydrolases that degrade macromole-
cules, high concentrations of readily releasable calcium
(Christensen et al., 2002; Moreno and Docampo, 2009; Patel
and Docampo, 2010), and high concentrations of potentially
redox-active iron (Brun and Brunk, 1970; Kidane et al., 2006).
When dysfunctional, endolysosomes can contribute to altered
calcium homoeostasis (Korkotian et al., 1999; Pelled et al.,
2005; Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008) and increased oxidative stress
(Pivtoraiko et al., 2009). Disruptions in endolysosome
functions perturb numerous cellular functions and can
ultimately result in the initiation of cell death pathways
(Kroemer and Jaattela, 2005; Kurz et al., 2008). Therefore it is
of potential significance to further understand the patho-
genesis of HAND that we found that HIV-1 Tat-enlarged
endolysosomes, elevated endolysosome pH, decreased specific
activities of endolysosome enzymes, disrupted endolysosome
membrane integrity and inhibited autophagy, all of which
occurred prior to significant increases in HIV-1 Tat-induced
neuronal cell death. Thus, the altered structure and function
of endolysosomes could underlie, at least in part, the
pathogenesis of HAND.
HIV-1 Tat protein continues to be implicated in the
pathogenesis of HAND, in part, because there is significant
neuronal dysfunction even though neurons are not infected
by HIV-1 virus (Nuovo et al., 1994; Merino et al., 2011). HIV-
Tat has been shown to, for example, activate NMDA (N-
methyl-D-aspartate) receptors (Nath et al., 2000; Haughey
et al., 2001; Eugenin et al., 2003), alter calcium homoeostasis
(Kruman et al., 1998; Haughey et al., 1999; Bonavia et al.,
2001), and increase oxidative stress (Kruman et al., 1998;
Aksenov et al., 2001; Perry et al., 2005). HIV-1 Tat is actively
secreted by infected glial cells and, following binding to
neuronal cell surface receptors, it enters the endolysosome
system following receptor-mediated endocytosis (Mann and
Frankel, 1991; Liu et al., 2000). Although we did not
determine the extent to which previously identified receptors
mediate the endocytosis of HIV-1 Tat in neurons, including
CD26 (Gutheil et al., 1994), CXCR4 (Xiao et al., 2000), heparin
sulphate proteoglycans (Tyagi et al., 2001), and the LDL
receptor-related protein (Liu et al., 2000; Deshmane et al.,
2011), we did observe the presence of HIV-1 Tat in neuronal
endolysosomes.
Neurons are long-lived post-mitotic cells that possess an
elaborate endolysosome system to exercise quality control.
Substrates for degradation are delivered to lysosomes by two
general routes: endocytosis and autophagy. Endocytosis is not
only responsible for taking up extracellular nutrients, but also
is responsible for maintaining the integrity of axons and
synapses because neurons are extremely polar cells with
especially large volumes of cytoplasm. In contrast, autophagy
is responsible for removing unwanted cytosolic proteins and
`worn out' organelles (Nixon and Cataldo, 1995, 2006).
Alterations in the structure and function of neuronal
endolysosomes have been noted in HAND (Gelman et al.,
2005; Spector and Zhou, 2008; Zhou and Spector, 2008) and
because HIV-1 Tat can accumulate in neuronal endolyso-
somes, we determined the extent to which HIV-1 Tat
disturbed neuronal endolysosome structure and function.
We demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat disturbed endolysosomes
and inhibited autophagy as indicated by changes to marker
proteins. There exist three types of autophagy in cells: macro-
autophagy, microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autop-
hagy. As the best-studied type of autophagy, macroauto-
phagy includes three stages such as autophagosome
membrane origination, autophagosome formation and auto-
lysosome formation. Accordingly, we focused our studies of
the effects of HIV-1 Tat on macroautophagy using three
markers: LC3 which mediates the initiation process of
(Winslow and Rubinsztein, 2008), Atg5 which drives the
elongation process of (Mizushima, 2007), and p62 which
inhibits autophagy (Ichimura and Komatsu, 2010; Bjorkoy
et al., 2005; Pankiv et al., 2007). Our findings suggest that
HIV-1 Tat directly affects the morphology and function of
endolysosomes and autophagy.
Low pH is critical for the degradation of internalized
materials, the trafficking and fusion of endolysosomes and
the formation of autophagy (Marshansky and Futai, 2008;
Ravikumar et al., 2010; Williamson et al., 2010). Thus, central to
the observed changes might be the ability of HIV-1 Tat
to elevate endolysosome pH. Our observations of elevated
endolysosome pH could help to explain alterations in the
digestive capability of endolysosomes as evidenced by
decreased specific activities of three different endolysosome
enzymes, which results in increased accumulation of inter-
nalized material thus altering the structure and size of
endolysosomes. In addition, elevation of endolysosome pH
could result in alterations in the trafficking and fusion of
endolysosomes (Hart and Young, 1991; Saftig and Klumperman,
2009). Furthermore, elevation of endolysosome pH could result
in alterations in the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes
(Kawai et al., 2007) thus inhibiting autophagy. Together,
elevation of endolysosome pH could exaggerate neuronal injury
and degeneration (Wong and Cuervo, 2010), and contribute
directly to HIV-1 Tat-induced neurotoxicity.
Although the underlying mechanisms whereby HIV-1 Tat
elevates endolysosome pH are unknown, the arginine-rich
domain of HIV-1 Tat between amino acid residues 49 and 57
could be responsible for HIV-1 Tat-induced elevation of
endolysosome pH because a series of other arginine-rich
peptides including penetratin, an amino acid domain from
the Antennapedia protein (sequences 43­58) of Drosophila,
a flock house virus coat peptide (sequences 35­49) and oligo-
arginines (R9) all have the ability to elevate endolysosome

pH (L. Hui, X. Chen and J. D. Geiger, unpublished data). It has
been shown that most of these arginine-rich peptides have
the ability to escape endolysosomes using the high proton
gradient (Drin et al., 2003; Potocky et al., 2003; Fischer et al.,
2004; Magzoub et al., 2005; Henriques et al., 2006), and here
we postulate that a proton-dependent peptide transporter
might be present on endolysosome membranes. Such a
peptide transporter could transport HIV-1 Tat out of
endolysosomes, and during the transporting process protons
leak out and endolysosome pH is elevated. Another way that
HIV-1 Tat could increase pH is by directly disrupting the
membrane integrity of endolysosomes and this is consistent
with our observations of increased leakage of Lucifer Yellow
dye into cytosol. Consistent with these findings are previous
reports that low pH induces the exposure of a highly
conserved tryptophan residue and allows the insertion of HIV-
1 Tat into endolysosome membranes (Yezid et al., 2009).
Furthermore, disrupted endolysosome membrane integrity per
se could lead to neuronal dysfunction and ultimately cell death
because the increased endolysosome membrane permeability
occurs in several models of apoptosis (Roberg and Ollinger,
1998; Turk et al., 2002; Guicciardi et al., 2004; Kroemer and
Jaattela, 2005; Kurz et al., 2008) and is an early event in the
apoptotic cascade that precedes destabilization of mitochon-
dria and caspase activation (Kroemer and Jaattela, 2005; Kurz
et al., 2008). These potential mechanisms warrant further
investigation.
Our finding that HIV-1 Tat disturbed the structure and
function of endolysosomes in primary cultured neurons prior
to any significant increase in HIV-1 Tat-induced neurotoxicity
suggests that the effects of HIV-1 Tat on endolysosomes may
cause considerable neuronal dysfunction. Further elucidation
of the involvement of endolysosomes in HAND might lead
to the design of novel therapeutic strategies, including
blocking the entry of HIV-1 Tat into endolysosomes and block-
ing HIV-1 Tat-induced elevation of endolysosome pH.
