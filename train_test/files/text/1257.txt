BMI and Headache Among Women:
Results From 11 Epidemiologic Datasets
Scott W. Keith1, Chenxi Wang2, Kevin R. Fontaine3, Charles D. Cowan4 and David B. Allison1
Objective: To evaluate the association between BMI (kg/m2) and headaches among women.
Methods and Procedures: Cross-sectional analysis of 11 datasets identified after searching for all large publicly
available epidemiologic cohort study datasets containing relevant variables. Datasets included National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS): 1997­2003, the first National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey, Alameda County
Health Study (ACHS), Tecumseh Community Health Study (TCHS), and Women's Health Initiative (WHI). The women
(220,370 in total) were aged 18 years or older and had reported their headache or migraine status.
Results: Using nonlinear regression techniques and models adjusted for age, race, and smoking, we found that
increased BMI was generally associated with increased likelihood of headache or severe headache among women.
A BMI of ~20 was associated with the lowest risk of headache. Relative to a BMI of 20, mild obesity (BMI of 30) was
associated with roughly a 35% increase in the odds for experiencing headache whereas severe obesity (BMI of
40) was associated with roughly an 80% increase in odds. Results were essentially unchanged when models were
further adjusted for socioeconomic variables, alcohol consumption, and hypertension. Being diagnosed with migraine
showed no association with BMI.
Discussion: Among US women, a BMI of ~20 (about the 5th percentile) was associated with the lowest likelihood
of headache. Consistently across studies, obese women had significantly increased risk for headache. By contrast,
the risk for diagnosed migraine headache per se was not obviously related to BMI. The direction of causation and
mechanisms of action remain to be determined.

Introduction
Various forms of headache (e.g., chronic daily headache,
tension-type headache, migraine headache) are disabling
conditions (1­3) that, compared to other common pain con-
ditions, produce the greatest loss of productive time in the US
workforce (2). Because the prevalence of the different forms
of headache varies widely in published studies (e.g., 1.3­86%
for tension-type headache (1)) it is difficult both to derive a
definitive estimate and to assess whether the headache preva-
lence has changed over time (4,5). Headache has been shown
to be associated with breathing disorders, caffeine consump-
tion, alcohol consumption, hypertension, anxiety, and depres-
sive disorders (6). Emerging evidence from case­control (6,7)
and observational studies (8­10) suggests that increased BMI
(kg/m2) might be a risk factor for headache.
In this study we estimate the association between BMI
and headache among adult women using data from several
large publicly available epidemiologic datasets. We restricted
our analyses to women because it has been established that
headache prevalence is much higher among women (3), and
preliminary unpublished data suggested that obesity's associa-
tion with headache varied substantially depending on gender.
This is consistent with the different associations observed for
men and women between obesity and a variety of health issues
(11­14). Rather than analyzing a single dataset and issuing the
near ubiquitous call for replication in the discussion, to evalu-
ate the reproducibility of results and show how results might
change as a function of study-related factors, we opted to ana-
lyze multiple data sets using identical statistical procedures.
This allowed us to derive estimates of the magnitude of the
BMI-headache association across all publicly available epide-
miologic datasets meeting a set of inclusion criteria.
Methods and procedures
Inclusion criteria for datasets
To rigorously evaluate the association between BMI and head-
ache among women, we used cross-sectional epidemiologic datasets
that met the following requirements: (i) they must be large enough

(i.e., 500 women) to allow us to generate reasonably precise esti-
mates across a broad range of BMI; (ii) they must contain the height
and weight of respondents (measured or self-reported) allowing cal-
culation of BMI; (iii) they must contain respondents' age, race, and
other variables of interest (i.e., smoking status, socioeconomic status,
and hypertension); and (iv) they must contain information on the
presence/absence of headache.
Dataset search procedures
To obtain epidemiologic datasets that met the aforementioned criteria,
we searched among the following electronic resources: Inter-University
Consortium for Political and Social Research (http://www.icpsr.umich.
edu/access/index.html), the National Center for Health Statistics
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/express.htm), the National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute (NHLBI) Population Studies Dataset (http://apps.nhlbi.
nih.gov/popstudies), the North Carolina Center for Population Studies
(http://www.cpc.unc.edu/restools/sdf), the Economic and Social Data
Service, United Kingdom (http://www.esds.ac.uk/access/access.asp),
and the National Library of Medicine's Medline and pre-Medline data-
set (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The search among these resources
yielded 11 datasets that met the criteria for inclusion in our analyses.
Overview of datasets used
We briefly describe here and in Table 1 the characteristics of the 11
datasets used in our analysis.
The Alameda County Health Study (ACHS) followed adults
selected in 1965 to represent the non-institutionalized population of
Alameda County California (15). Data collected included self-reported

demographic information, as well as physical, cognitive, psychological,
and social functioning.
The Tecumseh Community Health Study (TCHS), initiated in 1959,
investigates health and disease determinants in the rural community of
Tecumseh, Michigan. Participants completed extensive questionnaires
and medical examinations (16).
The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS: 1997­2003), begun
in 1969, is a continuing nationwide survey of the US civilian non-

institutionalized population conducted in households on a yearly basis
(17). A probability sample of households is interviewed each year.
Detailed information on the health of each living member of the sample
household is obtained.
TheFirstNationalHealthandNutritionExaminationSurvey(NHANES
I) was conducted from 1971 to 1975 on a nationwide probability sample of
individuals aged 1­74 years. We analyzed the data from women aged 18
and over. NHANES I collected data via 
questionnaire as well as through
comprehensive medical and dental examinations. NHANES I design and
sampling methods have been reported 
previously (18).
The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a 40-center, national US
study of risk factors and the prevention of common causes of 
mortality,

morbidity, and impaired quality of life in women. Postmenopausal
women, aged 50­79 years, completed health forms and attended a clinic
visit at baseline and 3 years later. Details of the sampling design, pro-
tocol sampling procedures, and selection criteria have been previously
published (19).
Study variables
Predictor. BMI (kg/m2) was the predictor variable of primary interest
and was calculated from either measured or self-reported (NHIS only)
weight and height. Self-reported weight has been shown to correlate
very highly with measured weight (20). BMI is largely independent of
height (r  -0.03), strongly related to weight (r  0.86), and reasonably
correlated with body fatness (21).
Outcomes variables. The datasets varied somewhat with regard to
how headache was assessed (see Table 2). We recoded and dichoto-
mized headache outcomes so that 0 = absence of an indicator of severe
or frequent headache or migraine versus 1 = presence of an indicator of
severe or frequent headache or migraine.
Covariates. Data on age, race, and smoking status were included in
the primary analyses (i.e., the primary models) as covariates. We also
included socioeconomic status variables (income, education, and
employment status), alcohol consumption, and hypertension as covari-
ates in our secondary analyses (i.e., the extended models).
Missing data. Missing data were handled using list-wise deletion (22)
because more complex missing data management procedures would
impose a significantly greater computational demand on an already
computationally demanding set of analyses. Furthermore, the complex
sampling designs of datasets, most notably the NHIS, would create
additional statistical issues related to imputation. Although there was
no reason to hypothesize that "missingness" was systematically related
to the study variables, we noted two datasets in which some study vari-
ables were missing information in at least 5% of records. In these data-
sets, we fitted logistic regression models for each variable that had such
"missingness" (>5%) to test for a relationship between missingness,
coded as a binary dependent variable and the other study variables as
possible predictors.
Statistical analysis
Traditionally, analyses of the association between BMI and dichoto-
mous outcomes such as mortality or the presence/absence of a given
medical condition have been estimated by treating BMI as either a
continuous or categorical variable (23). Each approach has advan-
tages and 
disadvantages. Advantages of treating BMI as a continuous

variable include the fact that it does not degrade the data, tends to
preserve power, and does not impose arbitrary cutoff points. Rather,

one can adjust for curvature in data via the incorporation of polyno-
mials of BMI into the model. The major advantage of treating BMI
as a categorical variable, with the categories chosen a priori, is the
(seeming) ease of communication of the results and the allowance for
marked nonlinearity that may not be easily captured by polynomials.
The nonlinear regression we used offers an alternative that captures
the advantages of treating BMI as both a continuous and categorical
variable (24). Specifically, we applied piecewise linear free knot spline
logistic regression models that do not assume a linear relationship
between BMI and headache and allow for fitting "breakpoints" in
the logit function at so-called knots that may be interpreted to define
categories (24). Thus, these data-driven models can take into account
potential nonlinearity by determining BMI categories for contiguous
BMI groupings of individuals with like patterns of risk while, at the
same time, allowing individuals with different BMI in a category to
have different levels of risk estimated as a function of their BMI. In
brief, we fitted nonlinear models to each dataset, used a parametric
bootstrap procedure to select the optimal spline model for BMI, and
then used a non-parametric bootstrap procedure to calculate accurate
s.e. estimates and confidence intervals that adjusted for complex sam-
ple design features. More details on the nonlinear statistical modeling
are contained in Supplementary Data 1.
Two analyses were conducted on each dataset: primary and secondary.
In the primary analyses, we adjusted for age, race, and smoking status.
In secondary analyses, we assessed an extended model that adjusted
for the aforementioned covariates as well as socioeconomic variables,
alcohol consumption, and hypertension. For the purposes of compar-
ing models within each dataset, the number of knot parameters fitted
in the extended model was fixed at the number of knots found in the
primary model.
We excluded BMI values <14 and >90 to avoid possible outlier
effects and data recording errors. After exclusions, a total of 220,370
respondents from the 11 datasets were available for statistical 
analyses.
Results were presented as parameter estimates with bootstrapped s.e.
and 95% confidence 
intervals. We also plotted odds ratios (ORs) for
graphically demonstrating the shapes of relationships we found and
calculated ORs and confidence intervals at selected BMI values (i.e.,
18, 25, 30, 35, and 40) as compared to a reference BMI value for each
of the 11 datasets. Supplementary Data 2 provides the details for cal-
culating ORs from our results.
Results
Table 3 and Figure 1 present the piecewise logistic regression
results for the primary model (i.e., adjusted for age, race, and
smoking) for each of the 11 datasets. Increased BMI was gen-
erally associated with increased risk for headache or severe
headache among women. Moreover, results from the NHIS
1997, NHIS 1999, NHIS 2003, and ACHS datasets located
"breakpoints" (knots) in the logit function around a BMI of
20 suggesting that the relationship between increased BMI and
the risk of headache may change significantly at this point. As
shown in Figure 1, our models often predicted that a BMI of
~20 was associated with the lowest risk for severe and/or fre-
quent headaches. The NHIS 1997 data also produced a sec-
ond knot at a BMI of ~35. At this point, the increased risk for
headache with increased BMI significantly decelerated sug-
gesting that people with a BMI >35 may share the same level
of headache risk with respect to BMI. The risk associated with
diagnosed migraine headache (as assessed in the WHI) or with
taking medication for headache (as assessed in NHANES I)
were not significantly related to BMI.
Table 4 and Figure 1 present the results for the extended
models (i.e., the primary models extended to include socio-
economic status variables, alcohol consumption, and hyper-
tension as covariates). As can be seen, these estimates were

generally in accord with those derived from the primary
models. The results from the NHANES I data were also not
materially altered when headache was coded either as: (No =
0; occasionally and regularly = 1 OR no and occasionally = 0;
regularly = 1).
Table 5 presents the ORs and confidence intervals derived
from the primary and extended models for selected BMI val-
ues (i.e., 18, 25, 30, 35, and 40) compared with the reference
BMI of 20. We chose a BMI of 20 as the reference level because
it was the most common nadir (i.e., the value most often asso-
ciated with the lowest probability of reporting headache)
across the datasets, thus making the computed ORs >1 in most
cases. This allowed us to present results on a consistent scale
for visually comparing ORs across the datasets we examined.

You can see that among women with BMI >20 the ORs were
mostly statistically significant and exhibited a similar increas-
ing pattern in headache risk across 9 of our 11 datasets. For
example, among the NHIS results: as compared to a BMI of
20, we estimated that mild obesity (BMI of 30) was associ-
ated with an increase in the odds of reporting the presence
of headache ranging from 31 to 65%, whereas severe obesity
(BMI of 40) was associated with an increase in the odds that
ranged from 49 to 118%.
We found that only NHANES I and TCHS had variables
that were missing information from at least 5% of records.
Smoking information was available in only ~40% of the
NHANES I women participants and was removed from
the analyses presented here. Analyses including smokers in
NHANES I produced the same nonsignificant results (data
not shown). The missing data regarding smoking was asso-
ciated with decreased BMI, decreased age, income below
$20,000, not being a current drinker, and hypertension.
Hypertension was missing in 23% of women in NHANES I
and this "missingness" was associated with taking headache
medication, increased age, being white, having attended
graduate school, earning over $20,000, having ever been an
alcohol drinker, and increased BMI (data not shown). In
the TCHS data, missing information on income (22%) was
associated with increased age; missing information on hyper-
tension (9%) was associated with income over $20,000 and
decreased BMI; and missing information on BMI (5%) was
associated with having headaches (data not shown).

Discussion
In this set of analyses of 11 different, large datasets collectively
containing >200,000 US women, we found that increased
BMI was generally associated with significantly increased risk
of headache, but not diagnosed migraines. We note that our
results across all datasets, with the exceptions of WHI (diag-
nosed migraines) and NHANES I (taking headache medica-
tion), suggested that, as compared to a BMI of 20, mild obesity
(BMI of 30) was associated with an ~35% increase in the odds
of reporting headache whereas severe obesity (BMI of 40) was
associated with an ~80% increase in the odds of reporting
headache. Across the databases, a BMI of ~20 was commonly
associated with the lowest risk for headache. These results were
not materially altered when socioeconomic variables, alcohol
consumption, and hypertension were also included in the
model.
With regard to migraine headache, the results from our
primary model of the WHI data, the only dataset that explic-
itly assessed migraine headache diagnosis, suggested that
BMI may not be associated with migraine, but our extended
model revealed a slight negative association. It is noteworthy
that many people with migraines go undiagnosed. Therefore,
the relationship between BMI and diagnosed migraines is not
likely to reflect the BMI relationship with all migraines (both
diagnosed and undiagnosed). Our main conclusion that BMI
was associated with an increased likelihood of headaches is
based on the following logic: (i) the WHI analysis showed no
positive correlation between BMI and diagnosed migraines,
and this is a finding of consequence because of the large WHI
sample; (ii) the NHIS analyses showed a positive association
between BMI and "headaches or migraines"; (iii) the ACHS
and TCHS showed a positive association between BMI and
"headaches" which were probably interpreted by most partici-
pants to include migraines; (iv) finding (i) suggested that there
was no association between BMI and diagnosed migraines in
our NHIS, ACHS and TCHS analyses; and (v) so we concluded
that the findings in NHIS, ACHS and TCHS suggest that BMI
was associated with non-migraine headaches and possibly
undiagnosed migraine.
Most of the databases we analyzed individually provided
ample statistical power to detect the estimated effect sizes we
observed. That, along with the consistency of the results, obvi-
ated the need to conduct a formal meta-analysis. Our find-
ings clarify and accord with previous studies. Specifically,
after adjusting for age, gender, race, and education, Scher and
colleagues (6) found that obesity was associated with preva-
lent chronic daily headache (OR = 1.34). Similarly, Ohayon
(10) and colleagues found that overweight/obese (BMI > 27)
respondents were more likely to report morning headache
than were adults with BMIs 20­25 and among a sample of
~15,000 Australian women, Brown (9) and colleagues found
that obese persons were more likely to report headache (OR =
1.47). Also, consistent with our primary model 
analysis of
WHI data, Bigal and colleagues (8) using data from over
30,000 participants, found that BMI was not associated with
migraine prevalence.
Interestingly, we observed some evidence in four datasets
(NHIS 1997, 1999, 2003; and ACHS) that unusually low BMI
may be associated with increased risk for headache. These
results suggest that increased BMI may be associated with
decreased risk of headache among the category of women with
a BMI <20 and increased risk of headache among those with a
BMI >20. This finding should be interpreted with caution since
the association was statistically significant at the 0.05 level only
in the NHIS 1997 and 1999 datasets. It was noteworthy that,
since only ~5% of all study participants had BMI values <20, we
may have lacked sufficient power to reliably detect the elevated
risk levels estimated to be associated with low BMI across stud-
ies. To our knowledge, low BMI, in the absence of major illness
(e.g., cancer), has not been previously associated with reports
of headache. Nonetheless, this finding merits further investiga-
tion before definitive conclusions can be drawn.
Nine out of the eleven datasets we examined had no study
variables missing >3% data, so any resulting effects from miss-
ingness were likely to be minimal in these cases. In NHANES I
and TCHS where we saw higher levels of missing data for some
variables it was less clear what, if any, effects missing values
might have had on our results. Interestingly, in TCHS, those
reporting headache were ~80% more likely to be missing BMI
data than those not reporting headache, but we cannot know
how this would influence the significant linear relationship we
detected between BMI and headache. Considering the results
available from the more complete datasets (i.e., NHIS 1997­
2003 and ACHS) and the similarity of those results to those
from TCHS, missingness may not have significantly affected
the TCHS results.
The mechanisms that might be responsible for the obesity­
headache association are unclear. However, obesity is asso-
ciated with the metabolic syndrome, a pro-inflammatory,
pro-thrombotic state that may contribute to headache devel-
opment and progression (25,26). Headache is also related to
sleep apnea, a condition highly associated with obesity (27).
Hypertension is also associated with headache (28) and obesity
is a major risk factor for hypertension (29). Moreover, head-
ache is one of the side effects of many medications, including
sibutramine, a medication to treat obesity (30). Each of these
offers a hypothesis meriting further study.
This study has limitations. First, the headache-related ques-
tions in the datasets differed, in some cases substantially. For
example, the WHI headache question focused on migraine
headache and asked, "Has a doctor told you that you have
"migraine"?" By contrast, the NHANES headache question
did not ask whether the respondent suffered from head-
ache but, rather, whether they used medication for headache
("During the past 6 months have you used any medicine,
drugs or pills for headache?"). Although we coded the head-
ache variables in the datasets to create uniformity in out-
come variables (see Table 2), these two datasets (WHI and
NHANES I) which asked about headache in a way related to
diagnosis or treatment are the only two that did not detect
clear and statistically 
significant associations. The assess-
ment of headache in the other datasets focused primarily on
obesity | VOLUME 16 NUMBER 2 | FEBRUARY 2008 383

epidemiology
the presence/frequency/severity of headaches. Second, we
only considered cross-
sectional datasets as they were more
widely available and different statistical methodology would
be required to analyze longitudinal data. Hence, our analy-
ses were restricted to headache or migraine status concur-
rent with BMI status. We did not look at data on subjects
who were free of headache at baseline, that were followed
prospectively to see if BMI or changes in BMI would predict
headache or migraine occurrence over time. Follow-up data
were available in only the two smallest studies (ACHS and
TCHS). In the future, we recommend analyzing any available
longitudinal data on headache and BMI by using nonlinear
methodology, similar to that which we have applied to these
cross-sectional databases.
In conclusion, the results of estimating the association
between BMI and headache in large, nationally representative
samples of women indicated that obese women have signifi-
cantly higher risk for headache. Further research is warranted
to study the direction and mechanisms of causation as well as
to investigate the possible BMI­headache relationship among
men. The possibility that weight loss may alleviate severe or
chronic headache problems among obese people also warrants
investigation.
