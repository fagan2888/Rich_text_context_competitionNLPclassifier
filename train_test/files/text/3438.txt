Introduction
Under headings such as "Plain Language," "Plain English,"
Clarity," and so on, there exists an endeavor to make organi-
zational language more easily comprehensible to costumers
and citizens. While a change to a more comprehensible lan-
guage practice seems quite sensible, the organizational chal-
lenges should not be underestimated.
James (2010) argues that the introduction of plain lan-
guage is an organizational endeavor.
In the following, I will discuss language changes as orga-
nizational changes.
The Danish tax authorities (called SKAT from the Danish
`skat' meaning `tax') are in the middle of a large language
change program, which includes a centralization of the lan-
guage in standard letters as well as occasional letters. Among
other things, this means that the central language unit (in col-
laboration with local offices) is responsible for language
change in a substantial number of letters. I interviewed a rep-
resentative for the central language unit (D. Piil) and two
representatives for the changed letters (L. Pallesen and D.
Poulsen). The names used in this article are fictitious.
All template-based letters are being changed and occa-
sional letters exceeding a thousand in numbers have to be
sent to the language unit (D. Piil, interview, L. Pallesen and
D. Poulsen, interview). The language project is a kind of
plain language project, although not referred to as such, nor
affiliated with any of the plain language organizations.
Head of the language program states the goal of the proj-
ect to be to save time and money: "There may be any number
of reasons to work systematically with language in compa-
nies. At SKAT we do it because it pays" (Holdgaard, 2012,
my translation).
In the following, I will take a look at the SKAT project
and use the SKAT language project as a case, trying to illus-
trate how the language changes in SKAT are reflected in
organizational changes to support and maintain the language
changes.
Literature Review
Plain Language
To begin with, let me just say that here I discuss organiza-
tional change in relation to language change. That means that
I will not discuss reception. This is done by Krone (2013) in
a sense-making approach to how citizens receive letters, and
by Bell (2007) who discusses research methodology when
dealing with the reception of plain language.
Kimble (1994-1995) defines plain language:
Plain language has to do with clear and effective
communication--nothing more or less. It does, though, signify
a new attitude and a fundamental change from past practices. (p.
52).
Kimble's definition makes plain language sound as if it is
the most logical of approaches to communicating with cus-
tomers and clients, but he also includes a few words on why
changing language from hazy and convoluted to clear and

Plain Language and Organizational
Challenges
Karsten Pedersen1
Abstract
Changing the language in an organization is a major organizational change. In this article, I discuss some of the organizational
challenges for one specific language change implementation, taking the stance that language change must be treated as any
other organizational change for it to have an effect. I work with the case of the Danish tax authorities' language project
aimed at producing more readable letters. The empirical data that I work with are two qualitative informant interviews. One
recorded at the language project's headquarters where they lay out the general lines for the project, and the other at the
payment center where they use the revised letters.

effective can be a daunting task, because sometimes people
just do not accept plain language as a language practice that
they can adopt even if it can be shown to work. But even if it
does seem counterintuitive that one would prefer a text that
does not work, over a text that does, we must not disregard
factors such as tradition and professional identity when we
talk about the use of language in organizations (Becker
Jensen, 2006; Lund, 2004; Pedersen, 2012). For us to find
out what it takes for a text to work, we will have to discuss
the organizational settings as well as the actual and desired
(organizational) functions of the text. Also we will have to
acknowledge the existence of communication culture as a
reflection of the degree of openness and dialogue to which an
organization wants to dedicate itself. In such an understand-
ing, organizations that seek secrecy over openness will have
and maintain a culture of secrecy, and organizations that seek
openness over secrecy will have and maintain a culture of
openness. Therefore, an organization that adopts a plain lan-
guage approach must realize that it entails openness and
dialogue.
Organizational Changes
Bolman and Deal (2008) identify four issues that they claim
are present in all organizational changes or innovation
processes:
First, it affects individuals' ability to feel effective, valued, and
in control . . . Second, change disrupts existing patterns of roles
and relationships . . . Third, change creates conflict between
winners and losers--those who benefit from the new direction
and those who do not . . . Finally, change creates loss of meaning
for recipients of the change. (p. 396)
So change, in the eyes of Bolman and Deal (2008), means
that an organization loses some of the stability that it used to
have and that means that any change process must have
something to offer the employees to make up for the loss. In
the case of language change, it means that old ways of
addressing the public are no longer valid, that a more direct
or perhaps inviting way of writing will change the role of the
SKAT employees from that of the keen controller to that of
the friendly advisor. As we shall see later, there will also be
people who find the new ways wrong and hard to live with.
They will be the losers. Those who find the new ways inter-
esting and challenging will be the winners. And all of the
above adds to a loss of meaning that was attached to the tra-
ditional way of writing.
Some of central problems in organizational change pro-
cesses are addressed by Bolman and Deal (2008) in their
reinterpretation of Kotter's (1995) change stages. Bolman
and Deal emphasize a number of elements in change pro-
cesses and list Kotter's change states adding their own four
frames (see Table 1).
Kotter's change states (on the far left of the schematic) are
an attempt to find and isolate the crucial elements in
organizational change processes. The model is a top-down
model, and therefore it applies very well to my case in which
the management has decided to implement language changes
and to have them distributed to the entire organization. The
eight change states are not an exhaustive list, but should be
regarded as the eight most important aspects of organiza-
tional change (Kotter, 1995).
Bolman and Deal's (2008) four frames represent an iden-
tification of four perspectives on organizational change. The
perspectives can be seen as separate in the way that each of
the four perspectives can be the main focus point in change.
At the same time, the four frames must be seen as comple-
ments to each other:
Multiframe thinking is challenging and often counterintuitive.
To see the same organization as machine, family, jungle and
theatre requires the capacity to think in different ways at the
same time . . . Success requires artistry, skill, and the ability to
see organizations as organic forms in which needs, roles, power,
and symbols must be integrated to provide direction and shape
behaviour. (pp. 437-438)
Bolman and Deal's (2008) four frames, it could be said,
lend Kotter's eight stages more detail and make it possible to
systematically talk about quite different initiatives applicable
at each stage.
They say,
Kotter's stages depict a dynamic process moving through time,
though not necessarily in a linear sequence. In the real world,
stages overlap, and change agents sometimes need to cycle back
to earlier phases. (Bolman & Deal 2008, p. 394)
This counters, according to Appelbaum, Habashy, Malo,
and Shafiq (2012), Kotter's own idea of the stages'
implementation:
Kotter argues that the eight steps should be followed in sequence
and that extended overlapping of the steps will compromise
success, implying that steps are requisite of one another.
Therefore, not implementing the first step will make it difficult
or impossible to implement the subsequent steps. Burnes (1996)
argues that such a prescriptive approach does not correlate well
with studies that suggest that organizations prefer to use
approaches to change that stems from their culture and thus
cannot easily be amended or replaced (Cummings and Huse,
1989; Schein, 1985; Burnes and James, 1995). (p. 775)
Table 1 is made with organizational change in mind.
Therefore, it might be fruitful to compare it with James'
(2010) list of success factors in dealing with a transition to
plain language.
James (2010), in contradistinction to Kimble (1994-
1995), takes organizational matters into account and identi-
fies six "critical success factors" for implementing plain
language in an organization. Below, I list James' six factors
together with the corresponding terminology according to

Kotter (as quoted in Bolman & Deal, 2008, p.395). All of
James' six success factors seem to overlap or partially over-
lap with one or more of Kotter's change states:

6. Reform of templates and procedures
Kotter: Remove obstacles and empower people to move

As we can see, only Success Factor 6 (Reform of tem-
plates and procedures) specifically has to do with language.
The five previous success factors are organizational
activities.
In terms of plain language, it should be noted that where
James (2010) talks about evaluating the plain language
effort, this is not the focus for Kotter and Bolman and Deal.
They are interested in anchoring change in the organization
and therefore are not necessarily interested in external fac-
tors such as readability but more so in internal ones such as
acceptance of the changes. The challenge for the proponents
of plain language, then, is to unite these two different
approaches and make external success a criterion for internal
ditto.
Plain Language and the Organization
James (2010) says,
Seeing plain language as just a skills problem for junior staff is
bound to fail. It is equally about changing the underlying culture
that staff have about the way they communicate and how that
communication represents them. It is also about changing the
underlying systems and processes that determine how they will
communicate. (p. 18)
For us to understand the scope of the changes involved in
language change, it is fruitful to view it as organizational
change. So what I discuss here are the prerequisites for a
change in an organization's approach toward writing prac-
tices, not whether or not these practices support plain lan-
guage. Because this is not a question of whether or not plain
language is recommendable, but a question of how organiza-
tional change is implemented.
As we shall see below, making people accept organiza-
tional change seems very dependent on communication that
will make change acceptable and relevant to the employees
affected by the changes. This is why the actual change is as
important as the management's ability to show that new
practices are preferable to the old ones.
Method
My empirical data come from informant interviews. The
interviews were designed to provide me with new knowl-
edge about the change process and therefore I chose to inter-
view a representative for the language center as well as
representatives for the daily users of the letters:
An important use of informant interviews concerns the
exploration of a less well-understood topic of interest. Informants
are selected on the basis of their knowledge, experience, or
understanding of a given topical area (Johnson, 1990). In such
cases, the interviewer takes on the role of student and directs the
interview in such a way as to learn from the informant, who is an
expert in the area. (Johnson, 2004, p. 493)
I performed two interviews. One with D. Piil, spokesper-
son for the language project, and the other with two employ-
ees at the payment center, L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen. The
interviews were semi-structured and both lasted slightly
more than an hour. To secure the informants' reliability, I
rephrased some of my questions to give the informants an
opportunity to change their minds. Also I asked for elabora-
tions and for the informants to explain some of their answers.
To make sure that the interviews were valid, I explained my
purpose for the informants to give them an impression of the
context in which I would use the interviews.
Results
The schematic that I introduced and commented on above is
made with organizational change in mind. Therefore, I found
it fruitful to compare it with James' (2010) list of success
factors in dealing with a transition to plain language. Below,
I will show how the Danish SKAT project deals with these
factors.
Pedersen 5
1. Example of other agencies
a. Sense of urgency, compelling story
There are two elements at stake here. First (the creation
of), a necessity for change; if people can see that other
agencies, other organizations, have changed and gained
from the change, there is a better chance that they will see
a planned change in their own organization as something
positive. Second, change might not seem as too daunting a
task if other organizations have already made similar
changes.
It is not clear from my interview with SKAT (D. Piil,
interview) whether or not they tried to create this sense of
urgency. The informants in the payment center, however,
state that they found some of the letters used before the lan-
guage project started, were "embarrassingly hard to under-
stand" (L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen, interview). That means
that there has been the feeling that it was necessary to do
something about the letters. This feeling did not come from
outside examples. When I ask L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen if
they have been presented with examples of other parts of
government making similar changes, they say that that has
not been the case.
Sense of urgency regarding language practice could take
as its point of departure that if the organization is supposed
to communicate adequately with its costumers, clients, or
partners, a change to different language practices is neces-
sary. Reference to similar organizations that have gone
through the same kind of changes could serve as inspiration
for skeptics. SKAT does not seem to have used reference to
other government agencies with similar projects (L. Pallesen
and D. Poulsen, interview) as a way of creating a feeling of
urgency. In fact, L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen said that as
SKAT is such a large organization, there is no comparison
(L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen, interview).
2. Training
a. Provide training, resources, and support, run team-
building exercises for guiding team
Training is central to change, for it creates the framework for
understanding why change is necessary and what the out-
come of the change is supposed to be. Team-building can be
an important part of the training, because not only might it
support the general training efforts, it might also give col-
leagues an opportunity to align their views on the changes. In
changes that involve language practices, training is abso-
lutely imperative for the organization to be able to get rid of
what could be perceived as well-proven practices.
In my case, SKAT has done exactly what 2 (Training)
Prescribes. The central language unit trains and builds teams,
so that language workers are dispersed all over the organiza-
tion (D. Piil, interview).
This is confirmed by L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen (inter-
view) who state that there have been local as well as central
courses and that the courses have focused upon the letters,
rather than on general writing principles. They emphasize
that they find the local anchoring a central part of the
training.
So training is important, but so is prior education. As
noted by Lund (2004), education is a key element in letter
writing, as any letter writing employee in an organization
draws on his or her general and/or specialized education to
do their job. Drawing on education also means drawing on
any writing norms and traditions implanted therein. But
one's original educational background might also be a con-
servative factor counterbalancing the changes aimed at. And
that is why Bolman and Deal's schematic emphasizes the
training aspect of organizational change. If an organization
can further educate its employees, they will have the possi-
bility of drawing on new organization-specific knowledge,
rather than profession-specific norms. And therefore a
change in language or writing norms is essential, if an orga-
nization does not want several profession-based writing
norms to exist throughout the organization. Writing norms
may come from a strong writing tradition, such as legal writ-
ing (Pedersen, 2006, 2007), but they may also belong to the
organization. If an organization wants its employees to fol-
low a specific writing norm, such as plain language, it will
have to change any already existing writing norms that are in
conflict with its own goals. L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen are
also aware of this aspect. They tell me how some of their col-
leagues still use what they call "drawer letters". These are
letters that the colleagues in question use instead of the new
letters, because the "drawer letters" conform to tradition
rather than the new principles. The reason they give for this
behavior is that the colleagues have been with SKAT for
quite a number of years and they even say that "it is easier for
us, because we come from the private sector" (L. Pallesen
and D. Poulsen, interview).
3. Evaluation
a. Plan for short-term victories, invest resources and
power to ensure early wins, celebrate and communi-
cate early signs of progress
There are several reasons why one would want to evaluate
organizational changes. The most important one is that it
enables you to monitor the development in the change pro-
cesses, so that you might change approach if necessary. Also,
positive evaluations (early wins) might add to the elements
mentioned under 1 (Example of other agencies) above,
thereby giving the process more stamina, as now the positive
stories are coming from within the organization itself.
Also in terms of evaluation, SKAT has done some of the
things that are suggested in 3 (Evaluation) above. What they
did not do was plan for early successes, but instead they were
6 SAGE Open
quite swift to change strategies if there was a reason to do so
(D. Piil, interview).
So evaluation is not only a tool to find out if what you are
doing actually works, it is also a way of convincing employ-
ees of the value of the change. The experience from SKAT is
that one has to be very careful when preparing evaluations,
because one of the experiences was that one specific letter
had prompted the receivers to phone the tax office sending
the letter. This did not happen with the corresponding old
letter and SKAT's assessment of the reason for this is that the
reformulated letter was much more inviting than the old one
(D. Piil, interview). L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen do not recog-
nize the experience that D. Piil talks about when I confront
them with what D. Piil said. They do, however, say that there
was quite some editing going on with the first letter changes
and that some of the changes did come about as a result of
reactions from the receivers of the letters (L. Pallesen and D.
Poulsen, interview). But they are not, as is D. Piil, able to
point to one specific letter and say that it was changed as a
result of more phone calls than they were aiming at. What
this means is that the episode with the letter referred to by D.
Piil seems to have been less significant to L. Pallesen and D.
Poulsen.
Also, according to L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen, there are
generally fewer phone calls now than before the changes in
the letters began. There are, however, no data to substantiate
the claim.
Seen from a plain language perspective, this is a good
thing, but if the promise in the organization has been that the
use of plain language would diminish the time used on the
phone, because receivers now understand the letters, this
increase in the number of phone calls could be counterpro-
ductive in the change process.
4. Internal champions
a. Create a "culture" team, broad involvement in devel-
oping culture, put commanding officer on team, in-
volve people throughout organization, solicit input,
stack team with credible, influential members
Internal champions are what communication theorists would
call opinion leaders; people who are important in an organi-
zations' construction of reality and interpretation of results.
These are the people who will make sure that results are
communicated throughout the organization, and by making
them part of the process chances are they will communicate
a positive take on the changes.
SKAT identified a number of language project ambassa-
dors, so that they have a contact within the various depart-
ments, and that the departments themselves have a contact
with the project. The contacts in the departments are "some-
body interested" within the various parts of the organization.
There are various functions of the local contacts. Two very
important ones are to make the local colleagues part of the
process and to give the central task force knowledge about
rules, regulations, and so on,. that are special to the various
departments (D. Piil, interview). In the payment center, the
approach to this has been exactly as D. Piil outlined with
local steering committees responsible for the development in
the different offices in the payment center (L. Pallesen and
D. Poulsen, interview).
L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen point out that the local com-
mittees have been in contact with various central offices to
make sure that the new letters meet communicational as well
as legal (central) standards.
5. Executive support
a. Put commanding officer on team, stack team with
credible, influential members
This is where the difference between on one side James and
on the other Kotter/Bolman and Deal becomes most clear.
Where the latter seems to take for granted that organizational
change is initiated at executive level, the former finds it rel-
evant to stress the point, to emphasize that changes of some-
thing as basic as an organization's use of language must be
taken seriously, also by its executives.
The SKAT language project was initiated by management
and backed by management. Also management members
have traveled with the language task force to show that they
do back the project. New rules such as mailings with more
than a thousand receivers must be approved by the language
task force have shown that management backs the project
(D. Piil, interview).
Locally, the involvement of commanding officers varies.
In D. Poulsen's office, the head of the office was also the
local head of the language project, whereas in L. Pallesen's
office the head of the office was merely "supportive" of the
changes (also the latter office holds significantly more
employees than the former). It was in L. Pallesen's office that
some of the colleagues used "drawer letters."
6. Reform of templates and procedures
a. Align structure to new culture, remove or alter struc-
tures and procedures that support the old ways
The structures must support the new ideas, and a way of
securing that, for example, letters are written according to
new principles is to update the stock letters and letter tem-
plates, so that everybody has no choice but to use the new
formulations.
I already mentioned SKAT's implementation of new rules
for sending out mass letters, but the most profound language
change was accomplished by simply replacing old letter tem-
plates in various computer systems with new ones (D. Piil,
interview). This ensures that the letters sent to the public are
the letters that management wants to send out. It does not,
Pedersen 7
however, ensure that the senders of the letters feel comfort-
able with the reformulated letters. That, however, can be
dealt with by a targeted approach to change organizational
communication practices. And communication practices are
that mix of organizational, educational, and traditional
approaches to communication that must be addressed in any
strategic language change in an organization.
In my interview with L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen, we saw
that some of the older colleagues still used some old letters,
the so-called "drawer letters." L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen
offer the explanations that this is possible in the office in
question (a) because of the nature of the letters and the fact
that it is possible to bypass the computer system in which the
letters are supposed to be conceived, and (b) because the col-
leagues responsible for bypassing the system are uncomfort-
able with the new letters. In D. Poulsen's office, this would
not be possible at all, because all the letters they send out
must be accessed via a computer system, so even if they
wanted to use the old letters, that would not be possible.
Organizational and educational changes are addressed in
Bolman and Deal's schematic. But tradition and profession-
based norms will be altered as a combination of organiza-
tional change and time. That means that, given enough time
and effort, an organizational (or a communication practice)
change can become a lasting change in the attitude toward
organizational communication. This is emphasized by the
success factors identified by James (2010).
Discussion
The above findings suggest that if plain language practices
are supposed to catch on in an organization, education, eval-
uation, local anchoring, management involvement, among
other initiatives, are crucial. That means that even if plain
language reforms are the goal, they do not have to be in
focus, organizational change does. The interviews seem to
suggest that plain language can actually be accepted and seen
as a relevant and desirable development by most staff as a
result of it being seen as organizational change.
From my interviews, it is clear that what happened in
SKAT was not a point-by-point implementation of Kotter's
change state, but rather a recursive process in which the local
employees were quite instrumental. When asked if they were
listened to and felt that they had a genuine influence on the
letters, L. Pallesen and D. Poulsen both said that they defi-
nitely found that to be the case. But deeming from the exis-
tence of the "drawer letters," it is also clear that had I had the
possibility to talk to other colleagues at the payment center, I
could have heard quite a different take on the project.
The SKAT language project seems to indicate that Bolman
and Deal's interpretation of Kotter's stages as recursive
rather than sequential is the more fruitful approach; as it lets
the changes find local as well as central ownership in the
organization.
Furthermore, the data seem to indicate that there has been
an organizational anchoring of the project, and that, even if
there is the odd "drawer letter," the payment center staff
accept the language changes and adopt the language project.
It is quite clear from the interview with D. Piil that even if
it can be shown that the language project seems to fit nicely
with Bolman and Deal's interpretation of Kotter, they did not
implement the changes by following a model.
This article began with Kimble's (1994-1995) claim that
"plain language has to do with clear and effective communi-
cation--nothing more or less." (p. 52) James (2010) argues
that there is more to language change than language change.
And that the introduction of such measures as plain language
is also very much an organizational project. James' claim
certainly seems to be confirmed in the case of SKAT in the
sense that many of the initiatives taken by the project group
are language change initiatives backed by organizational ini-
tiatives. The corollary for other plain language projects could
very well be to focus much more on organizational changes
than on arguments for the logical reasoning behind the
changes.
Beyond the scope of this organizational investigation lie
investigations to unveil whether or not the organizational
endeavors to convince employees and colleagues of the use-
fulness of plain language or plain language like projects can
be shown to be fruitful in the contact between government
organizations and citizens.
