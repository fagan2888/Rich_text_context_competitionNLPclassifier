GORDON-LARSEN, PENNY, LINDA S. ADAIR, AND
BARRY M. POPKIN. The relationship of ethnicity,
socioeconomic factors, and overweight in U.S. Adolescents
Obes Res. 2003;11:121­129.
Objective: To examine the extent to which race/ethnic dif-
ferences in income and education account for sex-specific
disparities in overweight prevalence in white, African
American, Hispanic, and Asian U.S. teens.
Research Methods and Procedures: We used nationally
representative data collected from 13,113 U.S. adoles-
cents enrolled in the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health. Logistic regression models were used
to examine the relationship of family income and parental
education to overweight prevalence (body mass index 
85th percentile of age and sex-specific cutoff points from
the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/
National Center for Health Statistics growth charts). In
addition, we used coefficients from our logistic regres-
sion models to project the effects on overweight preva-
lence of equalizing the socioeconomic status (SES) dif-
ferences between race/ethnic groups.
Results: Keeping adolescents in their same environments
and changing only family income and parental education
had a limited effect on the disparities in overweight preva-
lence. Ethnicity­SES­overweight differences were greater
among females than males. Given that overweight preva-
lence decreased with increasing SES among white females
and remained elevated and even increased among higher
SES African-American females, African-American/white
disparity in overweight prevalence increased at the highest
SES. Conversely, disparity was lessened at the highest SES
for white, Hispanic, and Asian females. Among males,
disparity was lowest at the average SES level.
Discussion: One cannot automatically assume that the ben-
efits of increased SES found among white adults will trans-
fer to other gender­age­ethnic groups. Our findings suggest
that efforts to reduce overweight disparities between ethnic
groups must look beyond income and education and focus
on other factors, such as environmental, contextual, biolog-
ical, and sociocultural factors.

Introduction
Obesity is a major public health issue contributing sub-
stantially to U.S. total mortality rates. National health ob-
jectives call for reducing ethnic disparities in health (1),
with an emphasis on the fact that economic and racial
inequality seems to have increased in recent decades (2­4).
Research on chronic illness found increasing socioeconomic
status (SES)1­health differentials with age (5). Type II
diabetes, dyslipidemia, and other measures of chronic dis-
eases are found among U.S. adolescents (6). SES-related
differences in obesity emerge during adolescence (7­10).
The literature on race/ethnicity and obesity shows higher
overweight prevalence among African Americans than
whites of the same age and sex (11­14), with an inverse
relationship between obesity and SES among white, but not
African-American or Mexican-American youth (15­17).
Whereas there has been considerable research on SES and
overweight prevalence among adults, little is known about
the impact of SES on lifestyle behaviors among youth (18).
There are no national studies of ethnic differences in over-
weight prevalence, among large ethnically diverse samples,
that take sociodemographic factors into account in a de-
tailed manner. Indeed, a recent review of 20 years of U.S.
cardiovascular disease studies concluded that only a small
percentage included both SES and ethnicity in analysis (19).

Our study examined the relationship of family income
and parental education to overweight prevalence in the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health). We further investigated the extent to which race/
ethnic differences in income and education account for
disparities in overweight prevalence among white, African-
American, Hispanic, and Asian teens; we also projected the
effects on overweight prevalence of equalizing these SES
differences between the groups.
Research Methods and Procedures
Survey Design
The study population consisted of 20,000 adolescents
enrolled in Add Health, a longitudinal, nationally represen-
tative, school-based study of U.S. adolescents in grades 7 to
12, supplemented with minority special samples and col-
lected under protocols approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. For
Add Health, a stratified (e.g., urbanicity, school size, school
type), random sample of all high schools in the U.S. was
selected, and 90,000 adolescents were surveyed. From
this sample, adolescents were selected for a core, nationally
representative sample, after which special samples were
added for greater representation of selected groups (such as
ethnic minorities). The survey design and sampling frame
have been described elsewhere (20).
We used the Wave 2 sample (14,438 eligible adolescents
measured between April and August, 1996). Exclusions
include Native Americans (N  178), because of small
sample size, and adolescents without complete height,
weight, and SES data. Our final analysis sample included
13,113 adolescents (12 to 20 years of age; mean 16.0  0.11
years; 46.5% female) from four major ethnic groups: non-
Hispanic whites (n  7135; 54.41%), non-Hispanic African
Americans (n  2795; 21.31%), Hispanics (n  2263;
17.26%), and Asians (n  920; 7.02%).
Study Variables
Height and weight were measured in Wave 2 during in-
home surveys and overweight status defined as a body mass
index (BMI)  85th percentile of age and sex-specific
cutoff points from the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention/National Center for Health Statistics growth
charts (21). Whereas the 95th percentile may be associated
with greater health risks, we used the 85th percentile to
define overweight for three reasons: 1) to understand the
full range of overweight during adolescence [see Must et al.
(22)]; 2) to allow an analysis using the Asian sample,
because there were very small numbers of Asian females
with a BMI  95th percentile; and 3) because the pattern
and direction of results were very similar using the 85th and
95th percentiles.
A combination of in-home surveys of parents and ado-
lescents provided race/ethnicity, household income, and ed-
ucation data. Race/ethnicity was categorized as Hispanic,
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic African American, or
Asian American. For simplicity, we refer to these groups as
Hispanic, white, African American, or Asian.
We examined income and education separately because
they represent distinct dimensions of SES. Each is used
differently in program and policy implementation (e.g.,
income qualification for many food welfare programs), and
each represents different constraints or advantages that may
affect behavior quite uniquely. Parental education was de-
fined as the highest level of education achieved for either
parent; our data showed that paternal education was higher
than maternal education in 1229 cases. Although differ-
ences were minimal, we used parental, rather than maternal,
education as a better indicator of household level SES. We
initially tested continuous forms of income and education.
In final models, we grouped the highest level of education
achieved for either parent into the following categories: less
than high school, high school/GED (reference), some col-
lege, and college degree and/or graduate or professional
degrees. Income was reported in $1000 increments. Where
income was missing (n  1958; 14.9%), income was im-
puted using data on parental occupation, family structure,
and school community. This method is similar to that used
in other national surveys, such as the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey. Income was used as a
continuous variable or grouped into the following cate-
gories: $0 to $20,000, $20,000 to $40,000 (reference),
$40,000 to $60,000, $60,000 to $80,000, and $80,000 or
greater. Three interaction terms were used in specific
models: income*less than high school, income*some col-
lege, income*college and/or professional degree, with
income*high school/GED as the reference category. Con-
trol variables included age, whether income was pre-
dicted, and pregnancy status (for females).
Statistical Analysis
The intent of this paper was to examine the net effects of
income and education on overweight by sex and ethnicity.
Thus, we used race- and sex-stratified models that included
only income, education, and key controls (e.g., age and
pregnancy), and excluded more proximate determinants of
overweight through which SES may operate. We reasoned
that the net effects of income and education would be the
same irrespective of pathway. Given the age range of our
study sample and the understood relationship between mat-
uration and overweight (23), we tested whether maturation
was important for this analysis. Although the maturation
coefficient was itself significant, inclusion of maturation did
not change the relationship of SES to overweight. We
therefore excluded maturation from the final models.
Statistical analyses were carried out using STATA Ver-
sion 6.0 (24). We used the widely accepted series of
STATA survey (SVY) procedures to correct for multiple

stages of cluster sample design and unequal probability of
selection to ensure that our results were nationally repre-
sentative with unbiased estimates and standard errors. We
used logistic regression models to investigate the associa-
tion between overweight prevalence and ethnicity, income,
and education. Initial logistic regression models confirmed
that the factors associated with overweight prevalence are
different for males and females and by ethnic group. Thus,
models were stratified by ethnicity and sex.
Further analysis demonstrated that the shape of the rela-
tionship between income, education, and overweight prev-
alence differed by ethnicity and sex. Thus, different speci-
fications were required to capture effects of income,
education, and overweight prevalence by ethnicity. Essen-
tially, we started with a basic model including continuous or
categorical income (depending on shape of the relationship)
and categorical education and education with income inter-
action terms. We then removed all nonsignificant interac-
tion terms. The final models consisted of the following: 1)
continuous income and categorical education (Hispanic
males, Asian males and females, and African-American
males and females); 2) continuous income, categorical ed-
ucation, and the income and education interaction terms
(white males); and 3) categorical income and categorical
education (white and Hispanic females). We present coef-
ficients from the models because it is a general principle
that odds ratios from models including interaction terms are
not easily interpretable.
Results
What Are the Disparities between the Racial/Ethnic
Groups?
Overweight was high among all U.S. adolescents (Figure 1).
However, overweight prevalence was highest for African-
American females, followed by Hispanics of both sexes and
white males.
Table 1 shows the distribution of respondents by catego-
ries of family income and maternal education. More than
half of whites, African Americans, and Asians had mothers
with at least some college education, whereas parental ed-
ucation was substantially lower among Hispanic adoles-
cents. Mean family income was lowest in African Ameri-
cans and Hispanics, with a higher proportion of African
Americans and Hispanics in the lowest income category.
The relationship between overweight prevalence and
family income differed by ethnicity (Figure 2), with more
pronounced differences among females. Overweight preva-
lence decreased linearly with increasing income among
white males. Hispanic males had significantly higher over-
weight prevalence than whites at mid-to-high family in-
comes. Asian males had significantly lower overweight
prevalence than whites at both low (less than $20,000) and
high ($60,000) income levels.
There was greater ethnic variation among females than
males. Overweight prevalence declined with increasing in-
come among whites. Overweight prevalence was lowest for
African Americans in mid-income levels, but highest for
those with lowest and highest family incomes, with statis-
tically significant African-American/white differences at all
income levels. Asians had significantly lower overweight
prevalence than whites at $0 to $20,000 and $40,000 to
$60,000 levels.
Results were similar for the relationship between parental
education and overweight (Figure 3). Females showed
greater variability in overweight by parental education than
males. African-American females had significantly higher
overweight than white females across all levels of parental
education except the lowest level. There were no statisti-
cally significant differences in overweight by parental edu-
cation for males.
We next used multivariate models, stratified by sex and
ethnicity, to assess the relationship of family income and

parental education to overweight prevalence. The results
show net effects of income and education, without consid-
eration of more proximate determinants of overweight prev-
alence (such as diet and activity).
Coefficients from these models are shown in Appendix
1. We used the continuous income variable for African-
American adolescents of both sexes and Hispanic males.
The identical model using categorical income for His-
panic females yielded comparable results.
For white males, the main effects of income and education
were not significant, although higher income was associated
with increased overweight prevalence in households with low-
est parental education. Among African-American and His-
panic males, neither income nor education was statistically
significant. In Asian males, higher income and parental edu-
cation were associated with lower overweight prevalence.
Among white females, incomes above $40,000 were signif-
icantly associated with lower overweight prevalence. For Af-

rican-American and Hispanic females, there were no statisti-
cally significant reductions in overweight prevalence with
increasing SES. Asians had significantly decreased likelihood
of overweight prevalence at highest education.
Will Equalizing Income and/or Education Reduce or
Eliminate Disparities in Overweight Prevalence?
In our final analysis, we examined the "experimental" ef-
fects of equalizing SES across the four ethnic groups. We
used coefficients from our logistic regression models (Ap-
pendix 1) to predict overweight prevalence at specified
income and education levels. For example, we estimated
overweight prevalence in each group, assuming that all
adolescents were from low-income households with parents
of less-than-high school education. We repeated this exer-
cise for other combinations of education and income. Re-
sults, in the form of predicted overweight prevalence, are
shown in figures below.
Predicted overweight prevalence results for males are
shown in Figure 4. While maintaining low parental educa-
tion, raising the income from the lowest to the middle level
(Figure 4, panels 1 and 2) increased overweight prevalence

by 15.4 percentage points among whites and 1.5 percentage
points among Hispanics and decreased overweight preva-
lence by 1.5 percentage points and 6.8 percentage points
among African Americans and Asians, respectively.
Moving from middle income/no high school education
(Figure 4, panel 2) to middle income/high school education
(Figure 4, panel 3) among males--which is the pattern for
the majority of whites--overweight prevalence decreased
by 8.5 percentage points in whites and increased 6.1 per-
centage points in African Americans, 1.2 percentage points
in Hispanics, and 7.6 percentage points in Asians. Moving
from this average level to the highest levels of income and
education (Figure 4, panels 3 and 5), overweight prevalence
decreased by 8.7 percentage points in whites, 0.6 percentage
points for Hispanics, and 15.3 percentage points for Asians,
but increased 1.2 percentage points in African Americans.
African-American/white disparity in overweight preva-
lence among males would be the smallest at the lowest SES
and greatest at the middle income/no high school level
(whites were 17.8 percentage points higher than African
Americans). The direction of African-American/white dis-
parity reversed as SES increased. At the highest level,
African Americans had a higher predicted overweight preva-
lence than whites. Hispanic/white disparity was lowest at the
average SES (3.6 percentage points) and highest at the highest
SES category (11.7 percentage points). Asian/white disparity
was lowest at middle income/highest-education levels (2.0
percentage points) and highest at the middle income/no high
school level (13.6 percentage points) (Figure 4).
Among females from low parental-education households,
raising the income level from the lowest to middle level
(Figure 5, panels 1 and 2) decreased overweight prevalence
among white females (10.7 percentage points) and in-
creased it among African-American (0.2 percentage points)
and Hispanic (2.1 percentage points) females, whereas
Asians remained the same.
Moving from middle income/no high school education
to middle income/high school education (Figure 5, panels
2 and 3) among females--which is the pattern for the
majority of whites--overweight prevalence would again
decrease for whites (3.7 percentage points), African
Americans (2.8 percentage points), and Hispanics (2.1
percentage points), but increase for Asians (13.5 percent-
age points). Moving from middle income/high education
to high income/high education (Figure 5, panels 4 and 5),
overweight decreased for whites (2.6 percentage points)
and Hispanics (7.9 percentage points), but changed little
for African Americans (0.2 percentage points) and
Asians (0.1 percentage points). The decline in over-
weight prevalence with increasing SES was of greatest
magnitude among whites, moderate among Hispanics,
and minimal in African Americans, who maintained
high levels of overweight prevalence at all SES levels
(Figure 5).
African-American/white disparity, which was small at
low SES, increased with higher SES, and peaked at the
highest SES (15.6 percentage points). Hispanic/white dis-
parity was highest at the average SES (9) and lowest at the
highest SES (0.1 percentage points). Asian-white dispar-
ity was greatest at lowest SES (29.6 percentage points)
and smallest at average (1.7 percentage points) and high-
est SES levels (2.9 percentage points).
Discussion
There was considerable ethnic disparity in adolescent over-
weight prevalence by SES, with a clear inverse relationship

only among white females. This is, to our knowledge, one of
the first studies to document the variation in association
between SES and overweight prevalence among large sam-
ples of adolescents from four major U.S. ethnic groups.
Will equalizing income and/or education reduce or elim-
inate disparities in overweight prevalence? To answer this
question, we used coefficients from stratified logistic re-
gression models and calculated, in each group, the predicted
prevalence of overweight at selected income and education
levels. This allowed us to see more clearly (given the
relationships found in the Add Health sample) whether
eliminating income and education disparities would also
eliminate disparities in overweight prevalence. Because the
coefficients from stratified models were used to estimate the
effects, we accounted for some of the differences in the
race-/ethnicity-specific effects of income.
We found that even if we were to equalize income and
education, we would not eliminate health disparities. Based
on our simulations, we determined that even at identical
SES levels, there were large differences in overweight prev-
alence by ethnicity. For example, because overweight prev-
alence decreased with higher SES among whites, but in-
creased with higher SES among African Americans at the
highest level of parental education and income, African-
American/white disparity in overweight prevalence among
females actually increased. This suggests that factors other
than SES are very important.
Our analysis strategy of examining only the net effects of
income and education on overweight was designed to test
the net effects of income and education on overweight,
rather than undertake causal modeling of these relation-
ships. Clearly, several other biological, sociocultural, and
environmental factors associated with income and education
are likely to affect overweight prevalence. For example,
environmental factors such as community crime rates and
provision of recreation facilities affect physical activity and
overweight levels (25­27).
We did not consider the more proximate determinants
of overweight prevalence (such as diet, activity, and
maturation) that may vary with socioeconomic variables
and may, in turn, affect risk of overweight. Failure to
account for maturation status may result in misclassifi-
cation of overweight among younger adolescents (28);
early maturing females are more likely to be classified as
overweight, whereas overweight is underestimated in late
maturing females. However, the effect on estimates of
overweight prevalence in the U.S. is small (28). Further-
more, the net effects of SES on overweight will be the
same irrespective of the pathway. There is limited re-
search on the relationship of SES to physical inactivity
(25) and nutritional outcomes (29). Because there is
limited empirical research on the associations between
SES and these proximate determinants, further research
is needed to clarify these relationships.
The strong inverse relationship of SES to overweight
prevalence among white female adolescents in this study is
similar to that found by other researchers (30­32).
Winkleby et al. (33,34) found higher cardiovascular disease
risk factors among African- and Mexican-American high
SES females. More research has been done with adults;
results in children and adolescents show weaker, less con-
sistent findings. Although Must et al. (31), in a study of
young adults (ages 16 to 28 years), found that poverty and
parental education were not related to obesity in white,
African-American, and Hispanic men or African-American
women, the inverse relation was seen for white and His-
panic women. Importantly, there are different meanings to
similar levels of SES based on ethnicity, in that ethnic
minority youth do not receive the same economic and social
benefits at identical SES levels as white youth (35­37).
Generalizability of our results may be affected by non-
participation bias related to overweight, ethnicity, and SES
distribution. For example, research with Danish men shows
that the response rate on a health survey was associated with
lower BMI and higher intelligence test score, educational
level, and social class (38). However, nonparticipation is
unlikely to bias our effect estimates significantly because it
is unlikely that the relationship of SES to overweight differs
in included and excluded adolescents. Attrition by SES,
ethnicity, and overweight has not yet been examined in the
Add Health dataset.
These results suggest that we cannot assume that the
benefits of increased SES found among white adults will
transfer to other age­gender­ethnic groups. Attention must
be paid to national efforts to reduce and prevent overweight
prevalence, particularly in light of national health objectives
for reducing the substantial health disparities between eth-
nic groups in the U.S. Our analysis suggests that reducing
disparities in income and education will not reduce dispar-
ities in overweight prevalence.
