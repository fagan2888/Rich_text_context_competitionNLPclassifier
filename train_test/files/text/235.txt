Are Adolescents Who Were Breast-fed
Less Likely to Be Overweight?
Analyses of Sibling Pairs to Reduce Confounding
Melissa C. Nelson,* Penny Gordon-Larsen,* and Linda S. Adair*
Background: Cohort analyses suggesting that breast-feeding pro-
tects against being overweight have been criticized for inadequately
controlling for confounding associated with the self-selection of
feeding practices.
Methods: Using nationally representative U.S. data from the Na-
tional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1994­1996), we
performed traditional cohort analyses (n  11,998) using logistic
regression to estimate the relation between breast-feeding and ado-
lescent overweight (body mass index 85 percentile, based on year
2000 CDC growth charts), controlling for known potential con-
founders. Breast-feeding also was assessed in a subsample of 850
sibling pairs to account for unmeasured genetic and environmental
factors.
Results: Among girls in the full cohort, the odds of being over-
weight declined among those who had been breast-fed at least 9
months; odds ratios ranged from 0.90 (95% confidence interval 
0.74­1.09) for 3 months of breast-feeding to 0.78 (0.64­0.96) for
9 months. A similar effect was seen in boys, although these trends
were less consistent. In contrast, an analysis of sibling pairs pro-
vided no evidence of breast-feeding effects on weight within dis-
cordant trends.
Conclusion: Cohort data indicate that odds of being overweight
decrease as breast-feeding duration increases, at least among girls.
However, sibling analyses suggest that this relationship may not be
causal but rather attributable to unmeasured confounding related to
mothers' choice to breast-feed, or to other childhood risk factors for
overweight. Our results illustrate the utility of sibling analyses in
understanding the true effect of early life exposures (such as breast-
feeding) on health outcomes over time, independent of confounding
factors that may not be satisfactorily controlled using traditional
prospective cohort methods.

Causes of the obesity epidemic in the United States1,2 are
not fully understood. Cohort analyses suggest that
breast-feeding may reduce the risk of obesity in childhood
and adolescence,3­9 with evidence of a dose­dependent re-
lationship.9,10 Several biologic mechanisms support this ob-
servation, including metabolic responses to bioactive sub-
stances unique to breast milk, the effect of nutrient
composition on insulin responses, and alterations in regula-
tion of feeding.8,11­13
Inconsistencies and null findings,8,9,14­18 however,
have fueled controversy in this area. Cohort studies have been
criticized for inadequate control of confounding factors as-
sociated with the decision to initiate and/or continue breast-
feeding,8 such as maternal care-giving, mother­child inter-
actions or other health-related behaviors. These factors are
difficult to measure in large cohorts, and they also affect
obesity risk, leading to possible erroneous attribution of risk
reduction to breast-feeding rather than other protective be-
haviors.
Other factors commonly measured in cohort studies
(eg, parental education) may be only theoretically important
confounders of the breast-feeding­overweight relationship.
In numerous studies reporting both crude and adjusted mod-
els, inclusion of these potential confounders produced little
change in effect estimates4,5,7,10,15,17,18 and yielded no in-
crease in precision.5,7,10,15,17 Although the underlying factors
that these variables are intended to approximate may be
important confounders, typically only crude proxies have
been measured in large cohort studies. Previous analyses
have devoted scant attention to understanding the actual
confounding effects of these covariates once included in
adjusted etiologic models.

We used matched full-sibling adolescent pairs to reduce
the influence of poorly measured or unmeasured confound-
ing. This analytic strategy helps to address early-life effects
on health19­23 by providing additional household- and ma-
ternal-level controls. Using one sibling as a control for
another accounts for multiple shared environmental and ge-
netic sources of variation that are not assessed in traditional
cohort designs, and allows a more accurate description of the
causal breast-feeding­weight relationship.
Our objectives were to determine whether breast-feed-
ing exposure and duration are protective against adolescent
overweight using traditional cohort analyses in a large, na-
tionally representative sample with measured weight and
height, and then to explore how this effect varies within
matched full-sibling pairs that have been fed differently
(compared with those fed similarly). We hypothesized that if
breast-feeding protects against being overweight, a breast-fed
child is less likely to become overweight compared with a
sibling who was not breast-fed. However, sibling pairs fed
similarly should have similar risks of being overweight.
Therefore, the between-sibling difference in obesity risk
should be greater among sibling pairs fed differently com-
pared with those fed similarly.
METHODS
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
cohort is a nationally representative school-based study of
youths (grades 7­12), augmented with selected subsamples
(eg, sibling pairs). Survey procedures have been described
elsewhere24 and were approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Wave I of the in-home survey (1994­1995) included 20,745
adolescents and their parents. Wave II (1996) included
14,738 wave I adolescents. Only school-aged adolescents
(including dropouts) were followed in wave II; adolescents
who had graduated were not followed.
This analysis excluded participants who were severely
disabled (n  84), pregnant (n  214; because of the
likelihood of weight misclassification), Native Americans (n
 125; because of small sample size), or missing data on
breast-feeding (n  2259) or weight or height (n  220) data.
The sample for the cohort analyses totaled 11,998. Compar-
ing the participants included in our analysis with those who
were not, there were differences by ethnicity (57% vs. 37%
white; 21% vs. 26% black; 17% vs. 19% Hispanic; 5% vs.
13% Asian) and parental education (15% vs. 18% parents
with less than a high school education; 26% vs. 30% parents
with a college degree or higher), but not by maternal obesity
(18% vs. 20% obese mothers).
The outcome measure of being overweight was based
on measured height and weight from wave II and defined
according to recommendations by expert panels.25,26 "At risk
for overweight" is defined as a body mass index (BMI) 85th
and 95th percentile of age- and sex-specific National Center
for Health Statistics/Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion 2000 reference curves,27 and "overweight" as BMI
95th percentile. These 2 outcomes have been combined
according to convention (and hereafter referred to as "over-
weight" for simplicity) as a BMI 85th percentile. Individ-
uals who were older than 20 years of age (n  11) were
considered 20 years of age for the purposes of overweight
status assessment. Information on whether the adolescent had
been breast-fed was obtained from in-home wave I parental
interviews. Breast-feeding refers to any breast-feeding, with
or without complementary feeding; this exposure variable
was categorized as never breast-fed, or breast-fed: 3,
3­5.99, 6­8.99, 9­11.99, 12­23.99, or 24 months. Covari-
ates were measured by traditional survey methods and in-
cluded parental self-reported maternal obesity status (yes/no);
parental education, household income and ethnicity (by pa-
rental and adolescent report); and current smoking habits
(smoker vs. nonsmoker); and pubertal status (early, average,
or late maturer)28 by adolescent self-report. Low birthweight
(LBW) status was defined as less than 2500 g; information
was derived from parental report of adolescents' birthweight.
Full Cohort Analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted using STATA (Re-
lease 7.0, Stata Corp, College Station, TX). Poststratification
sample weights used in descriptive analyses allow these
results to be nationally representative. Survey design effects
of multiple stages of cluster sampling were controlled using
SVY commands.
Logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of
breast-feeding on adolescent overweight. We collapsed cate-
gories of breast-feeding duration because of small sample
sizes at the longest durations. We conducted crude stratified
analyses to examine potential effect measure modification,
and we identified confounding using causal diagrams.29 We
fit a parsimonious logistic regression by specifying a model
with potential effect measure modification and confounding
variables.30,31 First, we removed potential effect measure
modifiers from the model if there was apparent homogeneity
across strata. Remaining effect measure modification terms
were then reduced using likelihood ratio tests, with   0.10
to limit the likelihood of erroneously eliminating important
variables. Lastly, potential confounders were removed from
the model if their inclusion did not satisfy an a priori change-
in-estimate criterion (a change in the odds ratio OR of
10%). Of all covariates evaluated, only the ethnicity and
income variables resulted in changes in the OR that met our
a priori criteria for inclusion in the final model. Gender was

identified as an important effect measure modifier, and there-
fore all models were stratified by gender. Logistic regressions
predicting likelihood of overweight were repeated in the
sibling sample to test whether a protective effect of breast-
feeding was present, without accounting for sibship.
Sibling Pair Subsample and Analyses
To expand the findings of traditional cohort analyses,
we selected a subsample of subjects matched with a full-
sibling adolescent to control for shared genetic and environ-
mental characteristics.32 Our analyses consisted of all full-
sibling, nontwin pairs (n  850) identified in the full cohort,
with complete height, weight, and breast-feeding data for
both siblings. SVY commands were used to control for
household clustering. Statistical power for the multinomial
logistic regression was assessed using nQuery Advisor (Re-
lease 5.0, Statistical Solutions; Saugus, MA). Our analytic
design accounts for sibling pairs and tests whether differences
in feeding practices influence weight outcomes of 2 siblings
with shared environmental exposures and genetic back-
ground. If breast-feeding protects against overweight, we
would expect differences in feeding practices to yield differ-
ences in weight status. This hypothesis was tested using
continuous and categorical outcomes representing weight.
Sibling pairs were ordered by BMI-for-age Z-score,
with the heavier sibling identified as sibling 1. Linear regres-
sion first was used to predict within-pair Z-score differences
from indicator variables of breast-feeding status (ever versus
never breast-fed) for concordant and discordant breast-feed-
ing pairs (Eq 1).

We hypothesized that among pairs that were discor-
dantly fed, the breast-fed sibling would be lighter (ie, have a
lower BMI-for-age Z-score) than the nonbreast-fed sibling.
Using linear regression to predict BMI-for-age Z-score dif-
ferences, we expected large, positive differences in Z-scores
if the lighter sibling was breast-fed and the heavier sibling
was not breast-fed; therefore, if breast-feeding is protective
against overweight, we expect the regression coefficient 
1
to
be greater than 0. Potential confounders were again identified
by causal diagrams, and were evaluated by the a priori
change-in-estimate criterion.
Second, a separate analysis used multinomial (polyto-
mous) logistic regression addressing the hypothesis that
among discordantly fed sibling pairs, the breast-fed sibling is
less likely to become overweight (compared with the non-
breast-fed sibling) and that these differences in risk are
greater than those among pairs who have been fed similarly.
These analyses result in ORs comparing several predicted
outcomes (ie, the odds of both siblings becoming overweight
versus that of only one sibling becoming overweight, and the
odds of neither sibling becoming overweight versus that of
only one sibling becoming overweight).33 Dichotomous
exposure variables were defined as: the heavier sibling not
breast-fed, the lighter sibling breast-fed; the heavier sibl-
ing breast-fed, the lighter sibling not breast-fed; both siblings
breast-fed; and neither sibling breast-fed (referent).
These modeling strategies included assessment of po-
tential confounders (age, sex, birth order, and LBW status)
that differed between siblings. Family characteristics (such as
parental education or household income) were not included in
the models since these are shared between siblings (which is
a strength of this analytic approach). As in previous analyses,
sibling pairs are ordered by BMI-for-age Z-score. Thus in the
discordant overweight group, sibling 1 is overweight, and
sibling 2 is normal weight.
RESULTS
Full Sample Analyses
Characteristics of the nationally representative adoles-
cent cohort are given by breast-feeding duration in Table 1.
Half (52%) were never breast-fed, whereas 15% were breast-
fed for less than 3 months, and 33% were breast-fed for 3
months or greater, with few differences by sex or maternal
obesity. Breast-feeding initiation was lowest in non-Hispanic
black children, and highest among children of Asian parents,
as well as more highly educated parents. Approximately 25%
of girls (n  1179) and 27% of boys (n  1172) had a BMI
85th percentile and thus were considered to be overweight.
Age of participants ranged from 12 to 21 years. The final
cohort analysis sample was 72% non-Hispanic white, 13%
non-Hispanic black, 11% Hispanic, and 3% Asian, and
evenly distributed by sex.
Table 2 details the results of the logistic regression. In
general, ORs declined with increasing duration of breast-
feeding. We also assessed breast-feeding as a dichotomous
variable. Adjusting for ethnicity, parental education, LBW,
maternal obesity, household income, age, puberty and smok-
ing status of adolescent, the odds of being overweight given
that the adolescent had ever been breast-fed were 0.83 (95%
confidence interval CI  0.72­0.95) among girls and 0.90
(95% CI  0.76­1.05) among boys. Income was the only
potential confounder that produced 10% change in the OR.
When the sibling subsample was analyzed without
accounting for sibship and shared environments, the odds of
being overweight among adolescents who were breast-fed
was 0.78 (95% CI  0.63­0.97). The odds of being over-
weight among those breastfed at least 3 months was 0.69
(95% CI  0.54­0.87).

Sibling Pair Analyses
In the sibling subsample, both siblings were breast-
fed in 46% of pairs (n  374 pairs), and neither sibling was
breast-fed in 41% of pairs (n  364). Discordant breast-
feeding (only one sibling breast-fed) occurred in 13% of
pairs (n  112). Among the 374 pairs in which both
siblings were breast-fed, breast-feeding duration differed
in 267 sibling pairs (71%). Sixty-two percent (n  531) of
the sibling subsample were pairs in which neither sibling
was overweight, 26% (n  217) included 1 overweight

sibling, and 12% (n  102) were pairs in which both were
overweight.
In the linear regression model predicting BMI-for-age
Z-score differences, 
1
was not greater than zero regression
coefficient (standard error): 
1
 0.004 (0.11); 
2
 0.09
(0.11); 
3
 0.06 (0.06). Birth order, sibling LBW status,
sex and sibling age difference did little to change the regres-
sion coefficients.
In a separate model of all sibling pairs, difference in
breast-feeding duration between siblings (duration in sibling
1 minus duration in sibling 2) was not a good predictor of the
Z-score difference (
duration difference
 0.01 (0.01)), with the
regression coefficient not in the expected direction. These
results were similar among: only those in which both were
breast-fed, only those that were discordantly fed (ie, pairs in
which both were breast-fed but for different lengths of time,
as well as those in which only one sibling was breast-fed),
and only those in which both were breast-fed but for different
lengths of time.
The results of the multinomial logistic regression model
are presented in Table 3. We expect the odds of discordance
in overweight to be high among pairs in which only the
lighter sibling was breast-fed, indicating that the nonbreast-
fed sibling is overweight and the breast-fed sibling is normal
weight. ORs among pairs where only the lighter sibling was
breast-fed are expected to be 1.0, whereas ORs among pairs
where only the heavier sibling was breast-fed are expected to
be 1.0.
Compared with pairs in which neither sibling was
breast-fed and neither was overweight, the odds that the
lighter sibling of a discordant pair was breast-fed were 1.22
(95% CI  0.64­2.32) times higher and the odds that the
heavier sibling was breast-fed were 1.27 (95% CI  0.65­
1.25) times higher, suggesting little effect of breast-feeding
on weight status. In contrast, when compared with pairs in
which both siblings were not breast-fed and both were over-
weight, the odds that the lighter sibling of a discordant pair
was breast-fed were 0.52 and the odds that the heavier sibling
was breast-fed were 2.03, a result opposite to our original
hypothesis.
DISCUSSION
These analyses illustrate the difficulties of assessing the
influence of breast-feeding on later weight, as well as the
potential impact of unmeasured (or poorly measured) con-
founding in cohort analyses. The use of an alternative study
design (ie, matched sibling analyses) helped to address these
shortcomings. The findings from our traditional cohort anal-
yses are similar to those previously cited in the literature,
suggesting a potentially protective effect of having been
breast-fed on overweight status.3­8 These results also support
findings of a strong effect with increasing duration of breast-
feeding,9,10 although previous research in this area is not
consistent.8,13­18 However, in the sibling subsample, discor-
dant breast-feeding of sibling pairs did not predict BMI
Z-score differences or discordant overweight status. These
alternative results suggest that the effect of breast-feeding on
overweight may be weak or absent. This relationship may be
induced by confounding because of environmental and ge-
netic factors, reflecting characteristics of mothers or families
that choose to breast-feed.
Though the best method to establish a causal effect of
breast-feeding on overweight (independent of other factors) is
a randomized controlled trial, such trials randomizing breast-
feeding are unethical. Alternative data collection and analysis
strategies must be explored, such as the present analysis of
sibling pairs exposed to differing feeding practices but shar-
ing physical and familial environments. By using matched
pairs and thereby controlling for a variety of unmeasured (or
poorly measured) confounders, our results indicate the lack of
a positive effect of breast-feeding on overweight in this
sample. Although the sibling sample size is smaller than
traditional epidemiologic cohorts, it is larger than other sib-
ling samples19­22 and allowed sufficient power to detect an

effect. Similar sibling study designs have been used to eval-
uate relationships between intrauterine exposure to type II
diabetes and risk of adolescent/early adult overweight and
diabetes19,20; maternal feeding practices and preadolescent
overweight21; extreme low birthweight and subsequent cog-
nitive development22; and infant weight gain and childhood
obesity.22 These results provide a unique perspective that
adds to the current literature and allows for further hypothesis
generation, and to our knowledge, this sibling analysis is the
first study of its kind to assess this relationship.
Breast-feeding could be linked to later becoming over-
weight through numerous underlying processes, many of
which are difficult to measure. Although much discussion has
focused on possible biologic mechanisms, there has been
little research on other influential environmental and behav-
ioral factors that may confound this relationship. A mother's
decision to initiate and continue breast-feeding is highly
self-selective and nonrandom in nature. Traditionally unmea-
sured characteristics that may be associated with breast-
feeding, such as maternal care-giving, health behavior or
physical environment, likely also affect later risk of over-
weight.
Covariates measured in large cohort studies may not
adequately capture the underlying factors that affect the
breast-feeding­overweight relationship, thereby limiting the
ability to statistically control for confounding. The analyses
presented here, as well as previous analyses,4,5,7,10,15,17,18
demonstrate that many of these potential confounders result
in minimal changes in the point estimate, indicating little or
no actual confounding. Such comparisons highlight the short-
comings of traditional efforts to control for confounding,
even with use of models adjusted for numerous survey-
derived variables.
The sibling-pair study design can reduce important
unmeasured confounding by maternal and household influ-
ences. Despite the strengths of this approach, however, these
results may be limited in generalizability, as sibling pairs who
are discordantly breast-fed or discordantly overweight may
not be representative of all U.S. adolescents. Simply having
another adolescent sibling may be a factor that limits gener-
alizability.
In addition, this study may also be limited by the
potential residual confounding related to why a mother
chooses to breast-feed one sibling and not another. We
attempted to address this possible source of confounding by
controlling for sibling LBW status in the models. Other
specific factors may confound our results if they influenced a
mother to breast-feed one child and not another, and differ-
entially affected risk of overweight later in life. For example,
these models may be confounded by neonatal complications
in the birth of one of the siblings if the effect of these
complications had a reduction in later odds of adolescent
overweight (and was not reflected in birthweight status).
These types of confounders are not specific to sibling
analyses but rather are problematic in all observational epi-
demiologic methods, including traditional cohort analyses.
Some previous studies have controlled for preterm birth3,10 or
gestational age,18 or have excluded for abnormalities during
birth,4,6 but much of the existing literature has not taken these
issues into account.5,7,14,15,17 Our data may also be limited by
parent-recalled breast-feeding status. Although these types of
recalled measures are reasonable reproducible3,34 and valid,35
they may be less accurate than data collected prospectively.
The protective effect of breast-feeding on later over-
weight status has been accepted in various clinical settings, as
evidenced by its inclusion in a recent policy statement by the
American Academy of Pediatrics on the prevention of pedi-
atric overweight and obesity.36 Given the numerous benefits
of breast-feeding,37 nearly all mothers should be advised to
breast-feed, and initiatives to increase breast-feeding should
be actively pursued. However, the etiology of obesity is
multidimensional, and our findings suggest that any potential
effect of breast-feeding may be outweighed by the influences
of other household characteristics.
In a broader context, our findings suggest the need to
find alternative means of testing exposures that cannot be
manipulated (eg, breast-feeding), and to explore other meth-
ods of observational study design to lend strength to observed
associations and enhance evidenced-based health beliefs,
practices and recommendations. In addition to traditional
cohort analyses, other approaches such as the sibling analyses
presented here should continue to be vigorously explored to
tease apart the underlying determinants of health and disease
across the life-course and address the issue of unmeasured
confounding related to a variety of influences related to the
biologic, social, cultural and/or physical environment.
