Abstract
Purpose of the study:"Life-space" is the spatial area through which a person experiences and interacts with the world.
Life-space constriction, the shrinking of the spatial area that a person traverses, is associated with negative health outcomes
in later life. Racial and gender disparities in mobility as indicated by life-space constriction are thought to contribute to
broader disparities in health and functioning among older adults.
Design and Methods: Data come from the 5-year follow-up of the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital
Elderly (ACTIVE) Study (N = 2,765; mean age = 73.6; 75.8% women; 73.7% White). Life-space constriction was defined
as "not traveling beyond one's town." A series of logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to
estimate risk for incident life-space constriction by race and gender.
Results: Blacks and women had greater likelihood of life-space constriction at baseline. Women were more likely to experi-
ence incident life-space constriction at follow-up relative to men (Hazard ratio [HR]: 1.89, 95% Confidence interval [CI]:
1.26­2.83). Blacks were associated with lower risk of life-space constriction over time (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.45­0.99)
relative to Whites.
Implications: Disparities in life-space constriction by gender and race exist in later life. Understanding the processes under-
lying these mobility restrictions is important to developing intervention programs to enhance health and functioning for
older adults.

In 1943, Winston Churchill stated, "We shape our buildings,
and afterward our buildings shape us." Borgmann extended
this concept to life-space, recognizing the interplay between
the environment and human development (Borgmann, 2010).
Mobility, the ability to move through the environment, is
an important determinant of quality of life (Rantakokko,
Portegijs,Viljanen, Iwarsson, & Rantanen, 2013).Traditional
measures of mobility (e.g., Instrumental Activities of Daily
Living [IADLs]), do not capture person­environment inter-
actions or the spatial range of mobility (Allman, Baker,
Maisiak, Sims, & Roseman, 2004; Peel et al., 2005). These
aspects of mobility are represented by the concept of "life-
space,"the geographic and social boundaries within which an
individual spends his/her daily life. Life-space mobility can be

conceptualized as a series of zones, ranging from movement
within one's home to movement beyond one's town, state, or
geographic region (Baker, Bodner, & Allman, 2003).
A majority of community-dwelling adults aged 65
regularly travel outside their neighborhoods, but 10­20%
are confined to their homes (Ganguli, Fox, Gilby, & Belle,
1996; Zeltzer & Kohn, 2006). Life-space constriction is a
risk factor for frailty (Xue, Fried, Glass, Laffan, & Chaves,
2008), nursing home admission (Sheppard, Sawyer,
Ritchie, Allman, & Brown, 2013), and cognitive decline
(Crowe et al., 2008); and even modest constrictions in
life-space are associated with poor health outcomes (Xue
et al., 2008). Correlates of reduced life-space include
older age, lower education, functional limitations, cogni-
tive impairment, depressive symptoms, health problems,
social isolation, inability to drive, and fewer neighbor-
hood amenities (Barnes et al., 2007; O'Connor, Edwards,
Wadley, & Crowe, 2010; Rosso, Taylor, Tabb, & Michael,
2013; Shah et al., 2012).
While documenting life-space constriction at the pop-
ulation level is informative for provision of health and
social services (e.g., meals on wheels, alternate transporta-
tion services), focused research on specific subgroups (i.e.,
women, racial minorities) provides a unique perspective
on the processes by which disparities in mobility emerge
and is thus informative for efforts to promote health equal-
ity. Parallel to gender and racial disparities in functioning
(i.e., Instrumental Activities of Daily Living [IADLs]) and
disability (den Ouden, Schuurmans, Mueller-Schotte, &
van der Schouw, 2013; Hoover, Rotermann, Sanmartin,
& Bernier, 2013), is a growing body of research indicat-
ing gender and racial disparities in life-space mobility. For
example, older women have smaller life-space relative to
men (Barnes et al., 2007; Boyle et al., 2010; Rosso et al.,
2013), but longitudinal studies are mixed as to whether
the incidence of life-space restriction is greater for women
(Allman et al., 2004; O'Connor et al., 2010; Shah et al.,
2012). Most longitudinal reports operationalized life-space
as a continuous variable, rather than examining specific
categories of constriction that may have more clinical sig-
nificance (i.e., neighborhood, town) (Rantakokko et al.,
2013). Additionally, risk factors for life-space constriction
may differ by gender; for example, married women are
more likely to stop driving in later life than married men
(Choi, Mezuk, Lohman, Edwards, & Rebok, 2013), indi-
cating distinct processes within a household that impact
mobility (i.e., gender or social roles).
By several metrics, Blacks have more functional impair-
ment and greater health burden in later life (Allman et al.,
2004). Such disparities reflect the accumulation of social
and economic inequalities across the life course (Ferraro &
Shippee, 2009). However, evidence regarding racial dispari-
ties in life-space constriction is mixed. Two cross-sectional
studies reported that Blacks have smaller life-space relative
to Whites (Boyle et al., 2010; Rosso, Grubesic, Auchincloss,
Tabb, & Michael, 2013) although others have not reported
this disparity (Sartori et al., 2012). In the only prior lon-
gitudinal study to date, Allman and colleagues (2004)
reported that Blacks had smaller life-space than Whites at
baseline; however, they were less likely to experience inci-
dent life-space constriction over follow-up. Moreover, sev-
eral predictors of life-space constriction (i.e., demographic
and neuropsychological factors, health behaviors, certain
diseases, geriatric syndromes) varied in magnitude by race
(Allman et al., 2004). However, the paucity of longitudinal
research focused on pathways underlying life-space constric-
tion limits the understanding on how these processes differ
by gender and race, and how such differences may contrib-
ute to the broader issue of health and healthcare disparities.
Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the
processes underlying prevalent and incident life-space con-
striction in later life, and to conduct a focused inquiry of the
roles of gender and race on these processes. We examined
these research objectives using data from the 5-year follow-
up of the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and
Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) Study, a prospective community-
based cognitive training randomized controlled trial. Based
on previous research we expected to find significant gender
and racial differences in life-space constriction both at base-
line and over time, even after adjusting for sociodemographic,
cognitive, and health factors. Furthermore, we hypothesized
that these gender and racial disparities would be differential
with respect to prevalent versus incident life-space restriction,
and that the intersection of gender and race (i.e., white men,
black women) would indicate unique patterns of life-space
restriction. We conceptualize these as exploratory research
questions rather than directional hypotheses given the mixed
findings from the limited number of extant studies. Findings
may inform efforts to reduce the impact of gender and racial
inequalities in physical functioning and disability in later life.
Methods
Sample and Procedures
The ACTIVE study is a multisite cognitive training clinical
trial (Jobe et al., 2001; Tennstedt et al., 2010); as a result,
recruitment was limited to older adults who were gener-
ally healthy (e.g., no substantial cognitive or functional
impairments). Participants were randomly assigned to one
of three treatment groups (memory, reasoning, speed of
processing) or control, and follow-up assessments were
conducted approximately 12, 24, 36, and 60 months after
baseline. The baseline sample consisted of 2,802 persons
aged 65­94 recruited in 6 metropolitan areas: Boston,
Massachusetts; Baltimore, Maryland; Detroit, Michigan;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Birmingham, Alabama; and State
College, Pennsylvania. This analysis is limited to non-
Hispanic Blacks (n = 726) and non-Hispanic Whites
(n = 2,039) who had completed data on all relevant
covariates. ACTIVE was approved by the Institutional
Review Boards at each site, and all participants provided
informed consent.

Measures
Life-Space
Life-space was assessed with the nine-item Life-space
Assessment at each wave (Peel et al., 2005). Participants
were asked whether they have been outside of their own
bedroom, house, yard/driveway, property, neighborhood,
and town in the last week, and whether they have been
out of their county, state, and region in last 2 months (each
item: yes/no). Participants traveled to testing sites at base-
line; thus they were able to travel at least beyond their
neighborhood at baseline. Therefore, in our analyses we
defined our outcome variable as life-space constricted to
town, and our final longitudinal model focused on the inci-
dence of life-space constriction within town (i.e. outcome
variable) This level was chosen because larger levels of life-
space constriction (e.g., state) are less likely to be related to
quality of life (Rantakokko et al., 2013).
Gender and Race
The main predictors of interest were gender (men = 0,
women = 1) and race (Non-Hispanic Whites = 0, Non-
Hispanic Blacks = 1) both assessed through self-report.
Other Predictors
Sociodemographic, health, and cognitive predictors identi-
fied in previous studies of life-space were included (Baker
et al., 2003; Boyle et al., 2010; Crowe et al., 2008; Sartori
et al., 2012). Sociodemographic factors included age, years
of education (both treated as a continuous variable), and
living alone (dichotomized as 0 = live with others, 1 = live
alone). Comorbidity was measured as a count of the num-
ber of self-report health conditions experienced out of
11 total (e.g., osteoporosis, asthma, cataracts, glaucoma,
macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, heart disease,
heart failure, stroke, hypertension, and high cholesterol).
Participants reported their driving status via a yes/no ques-
tion as to whether they drove a car in the prior 12 months.
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for
Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, 12-item
version (Radloff, 1977). Participants rated how often (on a
3-point scale) they experienced symptoms during the past
week, and items were summed into a total score; higher
scores indicated more depressive symptoms. Physical per-
formance was assessed by the Turn 360 Test (T360), which
measured the number of steps participants took to turn
in a complete circle. Fewer steps indicated better perfor-
mance, and the average of two trials was used in analy-
ses. Participants reported their self-rated health on a scale
from 1 = excellent to 5 = poor. Mental status was assessed
with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein,
Folstein, & McHugh, 1975). Participants had to score
23 to qualify for the study. Cognitive speed of process-
ing was measured with the Useful Field of View (UFOV)
Test. UFOV measured how quickly participants localized
and identified stimuli on a computer screen. Scores could
range from 16 to 500
ms for each of four subtests, and
the composite score of these subtests was used in analyses
(Edwards et al., 2005). Higher scores indicated poorer per-
formance. Everyday cognitive functioning was measured by
the Timed IADL Test (TIADL). On this test, participants
performed five tasks relevant to daily living (e.g., counting
change; reading food labels). Scores were the total num-
ber of seconds taken to perform all tasks, and errors were
penalized by standardized additions to completion time as
described in Jobe et al. (2001).
A dichotomous indicator for cognitive training arm was
also included in the analyses. It was important to consider
cognitive training because such interventions may improve
mobility(Ball,Edwards,&Ross,2007).Consistentwithpre-
vious research, cognitive training was coded as 0 = control
group and 1 = any training (O'Connor et al., 2010). Finally,
study site was examined in relation to life-space, as com-
munity size and amenities may impact mobility (O'Connor,
Edwards, Waters, Hudak, & Valdes, 2013; Rosso et al.,
2013). Study site was dichotomized as "0 = small cities"
(Birmingham and State College) and "1 = large cities"
(Boston, Baltimore, Detroit, and Indianapolis).
Analyses
Baseline differences between gender and racial groups were
examined using Chi-square tests for categorical variables
and Independent Samples t-tests for continuous variables.
Logistic regression was used to examine the correlates
of life-space constriction to town at baseline. All covari-
ates described previously were included, and continuous
variables were standardized prior to being included in the
model. Next, three Cox proportional hazard models were
fit to examine predictors of incident life-space constriction
to town over the 5-year follow-up period. Benefits of using
the Cox model are that it includes all participants in the
analysis, not just those who completed all years of follow-
up. Therefore, it explicitly incorporates incomplete out-
come assessment through right-censoring. The first model
was run in the entire sample, the second was stratified by
race, and the third was stratified by gender. These longitu-
dinal analyses included participants who had a life-space
beyond town at baseline (N = 2,095) and had completed
follow-up assessments (N = 1,798). Participants were coded
as having experienced life-space constriction at any follow-
up visit, and time-to-event was measured as the number of
months between the baseline assessment and the first report
of constriction. Those who never experienced constriction
were right-censored at their last follow-up. Analyses were
conducted using SPSS v.21 statistical software, and all sta-
tistical tests are evaluated at p < .05, two-tailed.

were Black, and the average age of all participants was
73.6 years. Most participants traveled outside of their own
property or neighborhood within the last week; however,
about one out of five had life-space constricted to town
or county. More than half (57%) of participants reported
they had not traveled outside of state, and most (80.5%)
participants had not been outside of region.
Life-Space Constriction at Baseline
In bivariate analyses, women were more likely to have
life-space constriction than men. However, after account-
ing for sociodemographic covariates etc., the relationship
between gender and life-space constriction was not sig-
nificant (odds ratio [OR]: 1.11, p > .05) (Supplementary
Material). Concerning race, Blacks were more likely to
report constriction at all levels of life-space compared to
Whites (Figure 1). Blacks were also more likely to live in
large cities and be non-drivers. After accounting for other
covariates, Blacks were still more likely to have life-space
constriction than Whites (OR: 1.54, p < .01).
Life-Space Constriction Over Follow-Up
Approximately 16% (n = 203) of participants experienced
incident life-space constriction, and 84% were right-cen-
sored, which means not experiencing incident life-space
constriction during the observation period. The results for
the overall sample are displayed in Table 2. Women were
more likely to experience incident life-space constriction
than men (HR = 1.89, p < .01), and Blacks were less likely
to experience incident life-space constriction than Whites
(HR = 0.67, p < .05). Other significant predictors of inci-
dent life-space constriction were older age, poorer IADL
performance, residing in/near small cities, and being a
non-driver.
Findings for the models stratified by gender and race are
shown in Table 3. Among women, significant risk factors
included White race, older age, poorer self-rated health, liv-
ing in/near small cities, and being a nondriver. Among men,
Black race, residing in/near small cities, and being a non-
driver were significant risk factors for incident life-space.

Whites were female gender, older age, poorer IADL perfor-
mance, being a nondriver, and residing in/near small cities.
However, living in/near small cities was the only significant
risk factor for incident life-space constriction among Black
participants.
Discussion
The primary findings from this study are that approximately
one in five older adults have life-space constriction to their
town, and gender and race differentially relate to life-space
constriction in later life. Moreover, several correlates of
incident life-space constriction also differed across gender
and race. Notably, in this study women were more likely to
experience life-space constriction over time relative to men
in their later lives even after accounting for health character-
istics. Previous reports on travel patterns of older Americans
indicated that women took fewer trips and traveled fewer
miles each day than men (Lynott & Figueiredo, 2011). This
gender disparity in mobility can be understood in the con-
text of gender roles (Choi, Adams, & Kahana, 2013). The
participants in our study spent their young and middle ages
in the era when gender norms were more rigid and women
were often expected to stay home, spending more time on
domestic work than men.
In addition to gender disparity, salient race differences
were identified. Specifically, Blacks were more likely to
have life-space constriction at baseline, but less likely to
experience constriction during follow-up in comparison
to Whites. Our findings were consistent with prior reports,
even though these previous studies defined life-space con-
striction differently from this study (Barnes et al., 2007;
Boyle et al., 2010; Peel et al., 2005; Rosso et al., 2013;
Sartori et al., 2012). Similar racial "crossover" effects have
been reported for racial disparities in late-life mortality
(Whitfield & Baker, 2013). Like the mortality crossover, the
life-space may be the result of additional selection pressures
on disadvantaged groups which results in premature life-
space constriction earlier in life, but leaves a more resilient
group in later life (Mehrotra & Wagner, 2013). Our find-
ings also suggest that future research should explore the
intersection of race and gender as they relate to the emer-
gence of health disparities in mobility in later life.
Findings should be interpreted in light of study strengths
and limitations. It is important to note that the definitions of
"town" may have varied among participants or by geogra-
phy (e.g., rural vs. urban areas); however, our longitudinal
analysis would have accounted for these fixed characteris-
tics. The sample sizes in the stratified groups (i.e. Blacks and
men) were small, which limited statistical power. The use of
self-report measures should be noted too. However, the rela-
tively healthy sample and longitudinal analysis allows us to
examine predictors of incident life-space constriction, and
we were able to examine and account for a wide range of
health and psychosocial predictors of mobility in our models.
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the utility of
explicitly examining the processes by which gender and
racial disparities in mobility emerge in later life. Situating
this study of life-space mobility within a health disparities
framework focuses attention on the differential processes
that impact functioning in later life for socially disadvan-
taged groups. Further research is needed to understand
how these processes that differentially impact functioning
in later life work together to protect against (or exacerbate)
disparities in mobility limitations among older adults by
geographical location (urban vs. rural areas) (Meng et al.,
2009) to provide effective community-level interventions.
In addition, research is warranted that will identify
modifiable risk factors that can be included in behavioral
healthcare interventions that would ultimately minimize

the reduction of life-space constriction and enhance the
quality of life among older adults. For example, nondriv-
ing status was identified as a critical risk factor for inci-
dent life-space constriction in our study; and interventions
that ease older adults transition to nondriving, such as
person-center mobility education programs or alternative
transportation support, might help reduce the risk for inci-
dent life-space constriction in later life (Choi, Adams, &
Kahana, 2012; Dickerson et al., 2007; Liddle et al., 2014).
Alternately, our findings also support research on inter-
ventions that are responsive to the needs of older adults
experiencing life-space restriction, including "smart home"
technologies (Arai et al., 2012; Güttler, Georgoulas, Linner,
& Bock, 2015), telehealth communications (Rocha et al.,
2013) and other emerging technologies that aimed at sup-
porting older adults "aging in place."
