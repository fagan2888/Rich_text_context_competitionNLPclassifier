ABSTRACT
Microvascular dysfunction, loss of vascular support,
ischaemia and sub-acute vascular instability in surviving
blood vessels contribute to secondary injury following SCI
(spinal cord injury). Neither the precise temporal profile of
the cellular dynamics of spinal microvasculature nor the
potential molecular effectors regulating this plasticity are
well understood. TGFb (transforming growth factor b)
isoforms have been shown to be rapidly increased in
response to SCI and CNS (central nervous system)
ischaemia, but no data exist regarding their contribution
to microvascular dysfunction following SCI. To examine
these issues, in the present study we used a model of focal
spinal cord ischaemia/reperfusion SCI to examine the
cellular response(s) of affected microvessels from 30 min to
14 days post-ischaemia. Spinal endothelial cells were
isolated from affected tissue and subjected to focused
microarray analysis of TGFb-responsive/related mRNAs 6
and 24 h post-SCI. Immunohistochemical analyses of
histopathology show neuronal disruption/loss and astro-
glial regression from spinal microvessels by 3 h post-
ischaemia, with complete dissolution of functional endfeet
(loss of aquaporin-4) by 12 h post-ischaemia. Coincident
with this microvascular plasticity, results from microarray
analyses show 9 out of 22 TGFb-responsive mRNAs
significantly up-regulated by 6 h post-ischaemia. Of these,
serpine 1/PAI-1 (plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1) demon-
strated the greatest increase (.40-fold). Furthermore, uPA
(urokinase-type plasminogen activator), another member
of the PAS (plasminogen activator system), was also
significantly increased (.7.5-fold). These results, along
with other select up-regulated mRNAs, were confirmed
biochemically or immunohistochemically. Taken together,
these results implicate TGFb as a potential molecular
effector of the anatomical and functional plasticity of
microvessels following SCI.

INTRODUCTION
Following traumatic SCI (spinal cord injury), significant
vascular disruption occurs at the site(s) of injury. This
interruption of vascular support is thought to be a key
mediator of multiple secondary injury cascades, all of which
contribute to loss of functional tissue (Nelson et al., 1977). In

the intact CNS (central nervous system), the microvasculature
is composed of an integrated unit consisting of ECs
(endothelial cells), pericytes, astrocytes and neurons. Any
perturbation of the normal functional and/or anatomical
integration of the microvasculature results in neural
pathology (Hawkins and Davis, 2005). Ultrastructural studies
have documented vascular pathology minutes after SCI
(Goodman et al., 1979; Koyanagi et al., 1993) and this
persists throughout the acute injury phase (Whetstone et al.,
2003; Benton et al., 2008a). In fact, ECs appear to be the first
cells to die following contusive SCI (Griffiths et al., 1978;
Casella et al., 2006). These immediate vascular events,
including increased permeability of the BSCB (blood-spinal
cord-barrier), induce oedema and contribute to detrimental
inflammation (Amar and Levy, 1999; Mautes et al., 2000). In
the subacute phase of injury, the penumbral microvascula-
ture is also pathologically transformed by loss of astrocytic
investment (Whetstone et al., 2003), regression of pericytes
(Benton et al., 2008a) and the perivascular localization of
infiltrating inflammatory cells (Popovich and Jones, 2003).
This second and more prolonged phase of microvascular
instability has been hypothesized to be a primary event
leading to chronic histopathology after SCI (Casella et al.,
2002; Loy et al., 2002). Cellular protection/stabilization of
microvascular elements within penumbral microvasculature
remains a largely unexplored therapeutic avenue due to a
relative lack of understanding of key molecular pathways
pathologically induced in smvECs (spinal microvascular ECs).
This is a critical issue as preservation of metabolic support of
spinal tissue spared by the primary injury event should result
in enhanced substrate for chronic recovery.
A number of effectors influence BSCB function following
traumatic SCI, including the critical vasoactive molecules
ephs/ephrins, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), and
functionally related co-factor(s), the angiopoeitins (Sharma,
2005). The neurotrophins BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic
factor), NGF (nerve growth factor) and NT3 (neurotrophin 3)
also modulate EC survival and proliferation in vivo (Ward and
LaManna, 2004), but their role in SCI-induced microvascular
plasticity is unknown. Several secreted cytokines, including
TNFa (tumour necrosis factor a) and TGFb (transforming
growth factor b) isoforms are increased following SCI and are
thought to be potent regulators of EC survival, proliferation
and function, as well as BSCB integrity (O'Brien et al., 1994;
McTigue et al., 2000; Han and Suk, 2005), acting, in part, via
the induction of VEGF expression (ten Dijke and Arthur,
2007). Previous in vitro evidence suggests that TGFb1 can act
in concert with VEGF to induce EC apoptosis (Ferrari et al.,
2006), a surprising finding with potentially important
implications for microvascular stability in the injured spinal
cord. Furthermore, MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) are
established regulators of vascular destabilization and EC
dysfunction following SCI (Noble et al., 2002) and cortical
ischaemia (Cunningham et al., 2005). A pathological connec-
tion may exist between TGFb1 and MMPs, as TGFb1 signalling
increases MMP expression (ten Dijke and Arthur, 2007).
Furthermore, MMPs are activators of latent TGFb1 in various
in vivo contexts (ten Dijke and Arthur, 2007), suggesting the
potential for a potent, reciprocal, feed-forward pathological
loop in the microvasculature following SCI.
Thus the principal goal of the present study was to
determine whether ECs are induced by TGFb in the early
phases of SCI utilizing multiple novel approaches. Using a
previously described model of focal spinal ischaemia (Benton
et al., 2005), we sought to replicate the non-traumatic stress/
ischaemia present in penumbral spinal tissue (i.e. immediately
surrounding the traumatic injury site). Furthermore, we
utilized new methodology to isolate spinal cord microvascular
ECs (Benton et al., 2008b) from this ischaemic spinal cord.
These approaches lead to the identification of multiple TGFb/
BMP (bone morphogenetic protein)-responsive/related
mRNAs expressed in the EC compartment concomitant to
the onset of significant histopathology following spinal
ischaemia. Taken together, the present results indeed
implicate TGFb, known to be pathologically altered after
SCI, in the acute pathological transformation of the spinal
microvasculature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Focal ischaemic SCIs
All surgical intervention and subsequent care and treatment
of all animals used in the present study were in strict
accordance with the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources,
National Research Council, 1996) and approved by the
University of Louisville IACUC guidelines. Focal ischaemic
grey matter SCI was accomplished by slight modification of
methods described previously (Benton et al., 2005). A total of
70 adult (approx. 6­8 week old) female Sprague­Dawley rats
(180­200 g; Harlan) were anaesthetized using sodium
pentobarbital [Nembutal; 50 mg/kg, i.p. (intraperitoneally)].
Once anaesthesia was achieved, the surgical site was prepared
by shaving, and a betadine scrub and laminectomies were
performed at the T13 vertebral level, exposing the L1 spinal
cord segment. Animals were randomized into groups
receiving a 0.75 ml microinjection of vehicle (saline+1 mg/
ml rat serum albumin) or rET-1 (rat endothelin-1; 15 pmol;
Sigma, E7764). A single midline incision was made in the
exposed dura and rET-1 was delivered in one microinjection
into the anterior sulcus using bevelled glass micropipettes
custom-pulled to an external diameter of 50­60 mm. The
incision sites were then sutured in layers and the topical
antibiotic Bacitracin was applied to the incision site. Animals
received prophylactic injections of gentamycin to prevent
infection [1 mg/kg, i.m. (intramuscularly)], and a 10 cc bolus
subcutaneous injection of saline was given to prevent peri-
operative dehydration. For longer survival times, rats were

housed two per cage and cages were placed on a 37°C
heating pad overnight. Immediately following surgery and for
48 h post-operatively, animals also received twice-daily
injections of buprenorphine [Bupronex; 0.075 mg/kg, s.c.
(subcutaneously), b.i.d. (twice daily)] and their bladders were
manually expressed twice daily.
Isolation of smvECs
Spinal microvessels in control and injured rat spinal cords
were intravascularly labelled using 200 mg of FITC-conjugated
LEA (Lycopersicon esculentum agglutinin) lectin (FL-1171, 2
mg/ml; Vector Laboratories) as described previously (Benton
et al., 2008b). Following anaesthesia, 100 ml of FITC­LEA was
delivered systemically by intravenous injection into the
surgically exposed right external jugular vein at a rate of
1.2 ml/h using a syringe pump (model # 780100, KD
Scientific). FITC­LEA was allowed to circulate for 15 min prior
to perfusion with saline. Spinal cord tissue containing
intravascularly labelled microvessels was then processed for
microvascular EC isolation. Briefly, 6 and 24 h post-SCI,
approx. 1 cm of spinal cord tissue spanning the injection site
was isolated, and the ventral intact/lesioned grey matter was
dissected and homogenized in ice-cold HBSS (Hanks balanced
salt solution). The crude homogenate was triturated using
multiple passes through 26 and 30 gauge needles and filtered
through a 70 mm mesh. smvECs were purified by FACS using a
MoFlo system (DAKO) using identical parameters with those
previously described (Benton et al., 2008b); approx. 90%
enrichment of microvascular fragments is achieved using this
technique. This microvascular fraction contains mainly small-
diameter vessels (i.e. ,10 mm in diameter) with little evidence
of preserved mural cell ensheathment (Supplementary Figure
S1 at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/001/an001e015.add.htm).
Following FACS isolation, microvascular fragments were
collected by centrifugation (16000 g) at 4°C and stored at
280°C.
TGFb/BMP-related gene microarray analysis
Focused microarray analysis of smvEC gene expression was
accomplished as previously described (Benton et al., 2008b).
Total RNA was extracted from microvascular ECs using the
PicoPureTM RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus Bioscience). Isolated
RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Reaction ReadyTM First
Strand cDNA synthesis Kit (SuperArray Bioscience).
Differential gene expression was conducted using the
RT2ProfilerTM PCR Array (rat, TGFb signalling PCR array;
catalogue number PARN-035, SuperArray Bioscience). qRT-
PCR (quantitative real-time-PCR) was performed using an ABI
7900 real-time PCR instrument. Results were analysed using
the Microsoft ExcelTM analysis template provided by
SuperArray Bioscience using the DDCt method. For each
gene, the fold-changes were calculated as the difference in
gene expression between smvECs from control spinal tissue
and that in smvECs from ischaemic spinal tissue.
Tissue processing and immunohistochemical
analysis
At multiple experimental timepoints post-ischaemia, animals
were perfused using 200 ml of 4% (w/v) PFA (paraformalde-
hyde). Spinal cords were dissected and transversely sectioned
at 20 mm on a cryostat. Sections were thaw-mounted on
microscope slides and stored at 280°C. On the day of staining,
slides were warmed at 37°C for 20 min and the mounting
matrix was removed with forceps. Tissue was blocked in 0.1 M
TBS (Tris-buffered saline; 100 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl,
pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% BSA and 10% normal donkey
serum for 1 h at room temperature (22°C). Primary antibodies
were applied in 0.1 M TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% BSA and
5% normal donkey serum overnight in a humidified chamber
at 4°C. Table 1 contains all information regarding the primary
antibodies used in the present study, including specificity data.
Sections were then incubated with TRITC- (tetramethylrhoda-
mine b-isothiocyanate; 1:200), FITC- (1:100) or AMCA- (1:100)
conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories). Negative controls for each epitope consisted of
experimental tissue exposed to species-specific pre-immune
IgG and did not result in significant staining. All photomicro-
graphs were captured using a Nikon Ti-E automated inverted
microscope equipped with a DS-Ri1 digital camera or an LS-
500 laser confocal microscope (Olympus) and Nikon Elements
BR analysis software or an Eclipse C1 laser confocal microscope
(Nikon Instruments). To eliminate the possibility of `cross-over'
signal, sequential excitation and capture was performed with
tissue containing multiple fluorophores analysed by laser
confocal microscopy.
uPA [urokinase-type PA (plasminogen activator)]
zymography
uPA enzymatic activity was determined as described prev-
iously (Benton et al., 2008b), which has been adapted with
slight modification of an established protocol (Heussen and
Dowdle, 1980). Briefly, 5 mm of spinal tissue, centered on the
ET-1 injection site, was rapidly removed from the spinal
column. Tissue was then bisected into ventral and dorsal
portions. Protein was extracted from the ventral tissue
sample containing ischaemic grey matter. Total protein (10
mg) from spinal cord tissues was resolved under non-reducing
conditions on SDS/PAGE (10% gels) containing 0.01 unit/ml
plasminogen and 1.5 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma). For standard-
ization, 10 pg of rat uPA (American Diagnostica) was loaded
on to each gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed
three times in 2.5% Triton X-100 solution and then incubated
in 100 mmol/l Tris/HCl (pH 8.2) buffer for 18 h at 37°C. The
gels were stained with 0.1% Amido Black solution and
zymograms were quantified by densitometric analysis using
ImageQuant software (Molecular Devices). Specifically, gels
were scanned and the images coverted into greyscale and
inverted so areas of enzymatic activity appeared as dark
staining. A rectangular box was then placed over the largest

band and the total area of dark pixels was counted. The same
box was used to quantify each band for individual
experiments. Background densities for each lane were then
subtracted from enzymatic values obtained from density
measurements of each band. This method has been used
routinely for the detection of uPA activity in diseased brain
(Burk et al., 2008) and spinal cord (Glas et al., 2007).
Statistical analyses
All quantitative data are expressed as means¡S.D. Differences
between two groups (SCI microarray results) were compared
using a Student's t test. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's
HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) post-hoc analysis was
used to compare results for uPA enzymatic activity.
Quantitative results from fold-changes in mRNA levels after
SCI in smvECs were compared using a two-tailed unpaired
Student's t test, assuming unequal variances. For all analyses,
statistical significance was defined at P#0.05.
RESULTS
Neuronal integrity/survival is compromised as
early as 3 h following onset of ET-1-mediated
focal ischaemia
Although anatomically isolated from the microvasculature,
neurons are linked metabolically with ECs and mural cells (i.e.

astrocytes, pericytes and smooth muscle cells) in the CNS.
Thus neuronal death/dysfunction may precipitate patho-
logical transformation of the CNS vasculature (Zlokovic,
2008). The results of the present study show that neuronal
pathology occurs very early following focal spinal grey matter
ischaemia. Significant grey matter pathology is observed by 3
h post-ET-1 injection, as demonstrated by the overt loss of
Map2 (microtubule-associated protein 2)- and NeuN-
immunoreactivity (Figures 1B, 1E and 1F). Large spinal motor
neurons (Figure 1D; arrowheads) were notably absent in the
acute phase of insult in affected grey matter by 3 h following
onset of ET-1-mediated ischaemia (Figure 1F). At early
timepoints following focal ischaemia, only grey matter
perfused by target vessels emanating from the anterior
spinal artery demonstrate significant pathology (Figure 1B).
This decreased Map2- and NeuN-immunoreactivity in
affected spinal grey matter is the result of neuronal death
and not down-regulation of epitopes as evidenced by loss of
Nissl-stained neurons in adjacent sections (Figures 1G­1J).
Temporal course of astrocyte loss from
microvessels affected by ischaemic SCI
Following experimental stroke, loss of perivascular astrocytic
endfeet has been documented by 6 h post-ischaemia,
resulting in substantial permeability and oedema in and
around affected microvessels (Polavarapu et al., 2007). In the
present study, we examined the temporal loss of functional
astrocytic contribution to microvessels following spinal cord
ischemia by Aqp-4 (aquaporin-4) immunostaining
(Figures 2A­2D; arrowheads). Aqp-4 is a water channel
associated with perivascular astrocytic endfeet (Abbott et al.,
2006) and is characteristic of an intact BSCB. At 3 h post-
ischaemia, when overt neuronal pathology is initially
observed, affected microvessels begin to exhibit partial loss
of astroglial investment, with most microvessels devoid of
Aqp-4 immunoreactivity (Figures 2E­2H). By 6 h post-
ischaemia, no GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein)- or Aqp-
4-immunoreactive elements are observed in affected grey
matter (Figures 2I­2L). This astroglial loss becomes more
pronounced by 3 days post-ischaemia, with astrocytes
becoming limited to the perimeter of spinal white matter
and completely absent from the ischaemic core as determined
by GFAP-immunoreactivity (results not shown). Importantly,
this temporal course of astrocyte and anatomical/functional
decoupling from the EC compartment correlates with the
appearance of abnormal EC tight-junctional phenotypes
(results not shown), consistent with what is observed after
contusive SCI in the adult mouse (Benton et al., 2008a).
Spinal endothelial expression of TGFb-related/
responsive mRNAs is induced concomitant with
microvascular plasticity
Table 2 summarizes the greatest magnitude changes in TGFb/
BMP signalling-related mRNA expression acutely after SCI (see
Supplementary Figure S2 at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/001/
an001e015.add.htm for the complete mRNA data set). Of the
83 represented genes, approx. 10% were induced at 6 and/or 24
h post-ischaemia. Of these, nearly all were transcripts known to
be TGFb1-responsive. More specifically, several within this class
were significantly up-regulated at both 6 and 24 h post-
ischaemia including serpine 1/PAI-1 (PA inhibitor-1) (41- and
24-fold), c-fos (34- and 8-fold), plau/uPA (8- and 3-fold) and
Tgif (7- and 3-fold). A smaller subset of mRNAs, including IL
(interleukin)-6 (27-fold), JunB (5-fold), p27Cip1/Waf1 (4-fold)
and Jun (2-fold), had significantly higher expression at 6 h, but
not 24 h, post-ischaemia. Interestingly, a number of the genes
regulating TGFb superfamily signalling in the EC compartment
responded to ET-1-induced focal ischaemia by significantly
down-regulating transcript levels. For example, cystatin C

Intact spinal grey matter staining in the rostral lumbar spinal cord of a sham-
control rat (A). As early as 3 h following ET-1 microinjection, significant loss
of Map2-immunoreactive tissue in focal grey matter supplied by targeted
supply microvessels is observed (B). At higher magnification, a dense network
of neuronal processes in ventral grey matter can be seen (C), a pattern that is
diminished by 3 h post-ischaemia (E). Furthermore, NeuN-immunoreactive
motor neurons are apparent in control tissue (D; arrowheads), but are lost by
3 h following ET-1 microinjection (F). Nissl staining of adjacent spinal cord
sections (G and H) corroborates this neuronal loss. Many Nissl-positive
neurons are apparent in control tissue (I) with obvious loss of these profiles in
ventral grey matter 3 h following ET-1-induced focal ischaemia (J). Scale

expression was significantly decreased at both 6 and 24 h after
SCI (2- and 5-fold respectively), whereas decreased expression
of Fkbp1b and Nbl1 (3-fold) and noggin (4-fold) mRNAs were
seen only at 24 h post-ischaemia. A mixed response of TGFb
superfamily receptor genes was observed, with IGFBP-3 [IGF
(insulin-like growth factor)-binding protein 3]/TGFbRV mRNA
levels exhibiting a 12-fold increase at 24 h post-ischaemia,
whereas significant reductions were observed in Itgb5 (6-fold),
Bmpr1b (3-fold) and Acvr1 (2-fold) mRNA levels only at 24 h.
Tissue levels of uPA are increased acutely
following ischaemic SCI
Previous results have shown uPA mRNA expression and
bioactivity to be acutely induced in smvECs by traumatic SCI
(Benton et al., 2008b). Consistent with these findings, we
show that uPA mRNA levels are significantly increased as
early as 6 h following ischaemic SCI (Table 2). To determine
whether this induction may have biological consequences in
the ischaemic spinal cord, we examined uPA enzymatic

activity in affected spinal tissue. As early as 3 h post-ET-1
microinjection, uPA proteolytic activity was significantly
increased, with levels further increasing by 6 h post-
ischaemia (Figures 3A and 3B). The temporal course of this
increased enzymatic activity parallels both the loss of
astrocytic endfeet in affected microvessels (Figure 2), as well
the induction of TGFb activation of smvECs as demonstrated
by microarray results. This result is important in that it
implicates uPA in the activation of TGFb within the ischaemic
grey matter and in ECs within affected tissue soon after the
onset of ischaemic/reperfusive insult.
MMP-9, a potent modulator of TGFb bioactivity,
is expressed in affected microvessels
In most tissues, including the CNS, pools of TGFb exist in
inactive forms within the pericellular space and may be
rendered bioactive by one or more activators, which include
proteases, integrins and thrombospondins (ten Dijke and
Arthur, 2007). Of these potential activators, expression and/or
activity of MMP-9 is induced in traumatic SCI (Noble et al.,
2002). In control ventral grey matter, no MMP-9 expression
was observed in smvECs (Figures 4A and 4B). The earliest
timepoint post-ischaemia where MMP-9 immunoreactivity
was observed was 12 h, where a marked increase was seen in
affected microvessels (Figures 4C and 4D), although some
affected microvascular elements did not exhibit detectable
immunoreactivity (Figure 4D; arrowheads). By 24 h post-
ischaemia, levels of MMP-9 expression remained elevated in
all affected microvessels (Figures 4E and 4F). This result
suggests a role for MMP-9 in regulation of TGFb activity in/at
affected microvessels in the subacute phases, but not in the
immediate phase, of smvECs activation following ischaemic
SCI.
Detection of multiple TGFb-responsive proteins
in spinal microvessels in ischaemic SCI
The rationale for the selection of mRNAs to validate at the
protein level was based upon (i) the magnitude of the
transcriptional changes revealed by microarray analysis and
(ii) the novelty of their role in acute microvascular
dysfunction in the context of SCI. Based on these criteria,
we chose to define the temporal dynamic of protein
expression levels of PAI-1, IL-6 and IGFBP-3, which represent
the three most highly up-regulated mRNAs examined in
smvECs acutely following ischaemic SCI. Surprisingly for IL-6,
we observed a low level of immunoreactivity in grey matter
microvessels in control tissue (Figures 5A and 5B; arrow-
heads). By 6 h post-ischaemia, levels of IL-6 were qualitatively
increased in activated microvessels (Figures 5E and 5F;
arrowheads). Unexpectedly, little IL-6 expression was

detectable in spinal microvessels 24 h post-ischaemia
(Figures 5I and 5J), but was again observed in vessels 3 days
following ischaemia (Figures 5M and 5N; arrowheads). This
phasic response is consistent with that quantitatively
determined for mRNA levels (Table 2). Microvascular express-
ion of IGFBP-3, another TGFb-responsive molecule involved
in cytokine function, was also complex. Low levels of
immunoreactivity where observed in control ventral grey
matter (Figures 5C and 5D; arrows), with an apparent
increase of smvEC expression by 6 h post-ischaemia
(Figures 5G and 5H; arrows). Expression levels appear to
decrease in affected microvessels by 2 days post-ischaemia
(Figures 5K and 5L), with little detectable IGFBP-3 immuno-
reactivity apparent in perfused microvessels 5 days post-
ischaemia (Figures 5O and 5P). This result suggests a transient
role for IGFBP-3 in the activation of the smvECs following
ischaemic SCI.
The most highly up-regulated mRNA observed in the
present study (40- and 24-fold at 6 and 24 h post-ischaemia;
Table 1) was that encoding the endogenous uPA inhibitor
PAI-1. In sham-control spinal grey matter, no detectable PAI-
1 expression was observed in spinal microvessels (Figure 6B).
As early as 3 h post-ET-1 microinjection, PAI-1 immuno-
reactivity was associated with perfused microvessels in
affected tissue (Figures 6C and 6D; arrowheads). This increase
in PAI-1 expression was maintained throughout the subacute
period post-ischaemia, with detectable levels of PAI-1
expression associated with activated smvECs at 2 and 3 days
(Figures 6E­6H; arrowheads). Interestingly, 5 days post-
ischaemia, little PAI-1 immunoreactivity was observed in
perfused microvessels in affected ventral grey matter
(Figures 6I and 6J). These results implicate PAI-1 in
contributing to the early pathological activation of the
microvasculature following focal spinal ischaemia. Moreover,
these immunohistochemical data showing correlative protein
expression and mRNA levels in ECs support the conclusion
that results obtained from FACS-isolated ECs reflect their
in situ transcriptional state. This is an important issue
considering the stress induced by the isolation protocol.
Figure 4 Microvascular MMP-9 expression is induced by ischaemic SCI
In control ventral grey matter, no detectable MMP-9 immunoreactivity is
present in smvECs (A and B). By 12 h post-ischaemia, significant MMP-9-
immunoreactvity is observed in affected spinal microvessels (C and D),
although a subset of microvessels does not express MMP-9 (D; arrowheads).
This increase in MMP-9 immunoreactivity is maintained 24 h post-ischaemia
(E and F), with all microvessels in affected tissue expressing detectable levels
of MMP-9. Confocal analysis confirms co-localization of RECA-1 and MMP-9
in the xz and yz planes (D and F; arrows). Scale bar550 mm (A­F).
Figure 3 Tissue levels of uPA enzymatic activity are significantly increased
in response to spinal cord ischaemia
At 3 and 6 h post-ET-1 microinjection, 5 mm of experimental spinal cords
(centered on the microinjection sites) were rapidly isolated, ventral spinal
tissue was dissected, and 10 mg of total protein was analysed by uPA
zymography (A). Densitometric analysis of zymographic results revealed that
by 3 h, levels of uPA enzymatic activity were significantly increased compared
with sham-injected tissue (B). Levels of uPA activity are further increased by
6 h post-ischaemia, and were significantly higher than both sham and 3 h
levels (B). Quantitative data are the mean uPA activity¡S.D. (*P#0.05,

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we show that induction of focal spinal
cord ischaemia results in rapid dissolution of NVU (neuro-
vascular unit) integrity. The use of ET-1 to induce vasospastic
spinal cord ischaemia is based upon previous experimental
models of ET-1-mediated stoke (O'Neill and Clemens, 2001).
In mammals, ET exerts its bioactivity via three structurally
related peptides (ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3), which bind two
subtypes of G-protein-coupled receptors (ETA
and ETB
), which
are highly conserved across multiple species (Schinelli, 2006).
Figure 5 smvEC expression of IL-6 and IGFBP-3 after SCI
Basal levels of expression for both IL-6 (A and B; arrowheads) and IGFBP-3 (C and D; arrows) were detected in the vasculature in
control spinal grey matter. Increased IL-6 immunoreactivity was observed in smvECs at 6 h post-ischaemia (E and F; arrowheads).
Interestingly, this expression appeared to exhibit a biphasic pattern, with qualitative levels diminished at 1 day (I and J), but
reappearing in activated microvascular profiles by 3 days post-ischaemia (M and N; arrowheads). Similar to IL-6 staining, levels of
IGFBP-3 immunoreactivity were intensified by 6 h post-ET-1 microinjection (G and H; arrows). However, levels were then found to
diminish progressively beginning at 2 days post-ischaemia (K and L; arrows), with little IGFBP-3 immunoreactivity associated with
perfused microvessels 5 days post-ischaemia (O and P; arrow). Scale bar550 mm (A­P).

In the healthy CNS, receptor expression is observed in
ependymal/subependymal cells (Tuschick et al., 1997),
Bergmann glia of the cerebellum (Tuschick et al., 1997), epithe-
lial cells of the choroid plexus (Tsaur et al., 1997), neurons
(Yamada and Kurokawa, 1998) and astrocytes (Schinelli et al.,
2001), with the highest levels of expression observed in the
vasculature (Yu et al., 1995; Chen et al., 2000; Hansen-Schwartz
et al., 2002). The ET system is up-regulated in response to brain
ischaemia (Edvinsson, 2009), suggesting that it may play a
role in the aetiology of clinical stroke. While less is known
about the precise role of ET-1 in CNS trauma, blockade of ET-1
receptors has been shown to ameliorate tissue loss and
facilitate functional sparing following experimental SCI in rats
(Uesugi et al., 1998; Peters et al., 2003; Ogawa et al., 2008).
Furthermore, blood levels of ET-1 are elevated in patients
suffering from traumatic SCI (Wang et al., 2007). These data,
combined with the results of the present study, support the
idea that ET-1 does play a role in secondary injury cascades
following SCI.
Although the primary action in nervous tissue is in
regulation of intrinsic vascular tone (Schinelli, 2006), it has
more recently been implicated in the modulation of
nociception and sensory function (Khodorova et al., 2009).
Although this implicates direct activation of neurons, little
data exist demonstrating receptor-mediated neurotoxic
actions of ET-1. Indeed, previous results show that direct
application of 1 mM ET-1 to mixed cultures of neonatal
neurons and astrocytes results in neither cell death nor
potentiation of excitotoxicity, whereas as little as 50 nM is
sufficient for cellular activation, primarily via ETB
(Benton
et al., 2005). In the present study, acute grey matter
pathology following ET-1 microinjection is limited to areas
corresponding to patterns of intrinsic blood supply of
targeted penetrating microvasculature (Mautes et al., 2000).
This supports the idea that the mechanism(s) of insult
observed is likely to be due to interruption of blood flow to
affected grey matter and not a direct cytotoxic action.
Results from the present study demonstrate early and
robust transcriptional activation of TGFb-responsive genes in
the EC compartment in response to spinal ischaemia/
reperfusion injury. Previous studies have determined that it
is primarily the TGFb1 isoform that is acutely increased
following traumatic SCI (Semple-Rowland et al., 1995; Streit
et al., 1998; Nakamura et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2009). In
clinical cases of SCI, TGFb1 appears to be primarily associated
with acute injury responses, with other isoforms being
expressed at more chronic phases of injury (Buss et al.,
2008). Among the postulated effects of this early TGFb1
response in traumatic SCI are included altered microglial
chemotaxis (Yao et al., 1990) and astrocyte proliferation
(Lindholm et al., 1992). Present results suggest that TGFb1
activation of the EC compartment in the early phase of spinal
insult may play a role in acute microvascular dysfunction/
plasticity following SCI. Also, these results suggest conser-
vation in the TGFb1 response in traumatic and atraumatic
SCI.
Figure 6 smvEC expression of PAI-1 is rapidly induced by ischaemic SCI
No detectable PAI-1 immunoreactivity was observed in control spinal grey
matter (B). As early as 3 h post-ischaemia, robust PAI-1 immunoreactivity is
observed in affected smvECs (C and D; arrowheads). This expression level is
maintained in smvECs for up to 3 days post-ischaemia (E­H; arrowheads). By 5
days post-ischaemia, PAI-1 immunoreactivity returned to basal levels in
perfused spinal microvessels (I and J). Confocal imaging definitively co-
localizes PAI-1 to FITC­LEA activated/perfused spinal microvessels in the xz
and yz planes (F and H; arrows). Scale bar550 mm (A­J).

The results of the present study suggest de novo synthesis
of TGFb isoforms is unchanged in ECs following ischaemic SCI
(see Supplementary Figure S2), a result confirmed by ELISA
analyses (results not shown). These observations support the
conclusion that EC stimulation by TGFb results from EC
exposure to extracellular sources of bioactive cytokine.
Platelets are a rich source of TGFb1, containing 40­100
times as much as other cells (Assoian et al., 1983). Early
studies of traumatic SCI established platelet aggregation as a
precipitating event in secondary vascular responses to injury
(Griffiths et al., 1978; Goodman et al., 1979). However,
observations of acute platelet aggregation in acute ET-1
lesions using CD61 immunohistochemistry shows little/no
detectable staining (results not shown). Other potential
cellular sources for TGFb isoform(s) in this context include
inflammatory cells (McTigue et al., 2000) and astrocytes
(O'Brien et al., 1994). Additional experiments will be
necessary to definitively identify stimulatory cellular sources
of TGFb in the acute smvEC response to SCI.
Another possibility supported by the present results, is that
local inactive pools of TGFb are rendered bioactive by one of
several potential pathways induced by focal spinal ischaemia.
TGFb1 exists in a biologically inactive form in complex with
the remaining portion of its precursor molecule, LAP (latency-
associated peptide), which is bound to a LTBP (latent TGFb1
binding protein) (LTBP-1, 3 or 4) forming the LLC (large latent
complex). Virtually all of the TGFb1 released from platelets
and other cells is in the LLC (Annes et al., 2003). In the CNS,
TSP-1 (thrombospondin-1) is a very potent activator of
TGFb1, as are the proteases plasmin, mast cell chymase,
metalloproteases [including MMP-9 and MT1-MMP (mem-
brane-type 1-MMP)] and thrombin (ten Dijke and Arthur,
2007). Interestingly, 24 h after contusive SCI in the mouse,
up-regulated expression of both TSP-1 (58-fold) and uPA (21-
fold) was observed in purified microvascular ECs (Benton
et al., 2008b). uPA cleaves plasminogen to plasmin which
directly activates TGFb (Tkachuk et al., 1996) as well as
indirectly by cleaving pro-MMP-9 to active MMP-9 enhan-
cing bioactivation of TGFb from extracellular stores (Zhang et
al., 2005). Thus not only is TGFb activated acutely after SCI, it
is also done so in a positive-feedback loop further enhancing
its actions. The results of the present study support the local
activation of TGFb by uPA in the immediate phase of
ischaemia/reperfusion, with other possible effectors includ-
ing, but not limited to, MMP-9, resulting in TGFb bioactivity/
bioavailability in the subacute phase of microvascular
plasticity in response to ischaemic SCI. Furthermore, these
results suggest that the molecular mechanism of NVU
dysfunction (i.e. increased expression of uPA, MMP-9 and
TSP-1) may be similar in both traumatic and atraumatic (i.e.
ischaemic and excitotoxic) forms of SCI.
Of the TGFb-responsive genes examined, the largest
change was the 11-fold increase in IGFBP-3 24 h post-
ischaemia, a result also demonstrated at the protein level by
immunohistochemistry. The role of IGFBP-3 on EC function in
the injured spinal cord is unknown, but its overexpression
may have implications for smvEC plasticity following SCI.
IGFBP-3 is normally expressed at high levels by hepatic ECs
(Zimmermann et al., 2000) and is the most abundant
circulating binding protein (Guler et al., 1989). The main
function of IGFBP-3 is to bind IGF, which results in enhanced
bioavailability and activity (Guler et al., 1989). In addition,
there are a number of critical IGF-independent actions of
IGFBP-3, including wound healing, cell adhesion/migration,
gene transcription, cytosolic trafficking and neuronal pro-
tection (for a review see Yamada and Lee, 2009). Data on
EC-specific responses suggest a controversial and context-
dependent role in vascular plasticity. IGFBP-3 accelerates EC
senescence in vitro (Kim et al., 2007) and inhibits angiogen-
esis in HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) and
chick chorioallantoic in vitro models (Oh et al., 2006). By
contrast, IGFBP-3 enhances differentiation of EC precursors
in vitro and enhances angiogenesis in an oxygen-induced
retinopathy mouse model (Chang et al., 2007). IGFBP-3
remains a poorly understood biomarker of CNS pathology.
Increased IGFBP-3 expression is associated with amyloid-b
plaque formation in affected microvasculature in brains of
Alzheimer's disease patients (Rensink et al., 2002).
Furthermore, the IGF system has been implicated in both
experimental stroke recovery/susceptibility in patients.
Specifically, IGFBP-3 mRNA is acutely up-regulated in the
mouse brain in response to transient ischaemia (O'Donnell
et al., 2002), a response that was associated with the post-
ischaemic inflammatory response. Interestingly, plasma levels
of IGFBP-3 are inversely correlated with both increased risk of
(Johnsen et al., 2005) and recovery from (Schwab et al., 1997)
clinical stroke. Taken together, the latter findings suggest a
protective role for IGFBP-3 in CNS pathology. To date, no
results exist regarding the putative role of the IGF/IGFBP-3
system in microvascular function and/or neuroprotection
following SCI.
Also of note is the present result demonstrating mRNA
levels of IL-6 to be significantly up-regulated in activated ECs
following SCI, with protein levels increased acutely, but not
sustained beyond, 24 h post-SCI. With respect to IL-6, in
addition to its role as a multifunctional pro-inflammatory
cytokine involved in the regulation of the acute inflammatory
response (Papassotiropoulos et al., 2001; Rose-John et al.,
2007), IL-6 protects HUVECs from H2
O2
-induced cell death
(Waxman et al., 2003). On the other hand, IL-6 induces tight
junction dysfunction and hyperpermeability in rat heart
microvascular ECs in vitro (Tinsley et al., 2008). In the context
of traumatic SCI, IL-6 mRNA levels are increased 3­24 h post-
injury in astrocytes, neurons and resident microglia (Pineau
and LaCroix, 2007). Similarly, IL-6 mRNA is elevated 3­24 h in
response to permanent MCAO (middle cerebral artery
occlusion) in rats, with expression peaking at 12 h post-
ischaemia (Wang et al., 1995). More recently, serum levels of
IL-6 were shown to significantly increase 24 h following
transient MCAO (Martinez-Revelles et al., 2008). Similar
results have been observed in patients within hours following
stroke onset, with a positive correlation seen between plasma

levels of IL-6 and both infarct size and clinical outcome
(Tarkowski et al., 1995; Huang et al., 2006). While no data
currently exist regarding whether the action of IL-6 is
deleterious in SCI, recent findings have linked IL-6 signalling
in the EC compartment with blood­brain barrier failure in
EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) (Linker et
al., 2008). Additional investigations will be needed to
determine the contribution of increased EC expression of
IL-6 on inflammation and/or angiogenesis following SCI.
The temporal response of uPA mRNA and activity observed
in the present study is consistent with observations made in
experimental stroke (Hosomi et al., 2001). Specific inhibition
of uPA in experimental stroke decreases infarct size by
protecting blood­CNS barrier integrity (Hamann et al., 2004).
The acute increase in uPA mRNA in the EC compartment
observed in the present study is likely to be of functional
consequence as uPA activity is increased in smvECs isolated
72 h post-ischaemia (R. L. Benton, unpublished data).
Furthermore, significant inductions of PAI-1 (mRNA and
protein) and uPAR (uPA receptor) (R. L. Benton, unpublished
data) in ECs after ischaemic SCI suggest a role for the PAS
(PA system) in vascular dysfunction and secondary injury
progression following SCI, as has been established in stroke.
The implications of the response observed here, as well as in
other types of neuropathology, are likely to be a fundamental
event underlying secondary degeneration. The PAS is best
known for its function in thrombolysis, but it also plays
substantial roles in many cellular processes outside of the
bloodstream, especially in the CNS (Zhang et al., 2005). The
central active protease of the PAS is plasmin, which is
generated by cleavage of plasminogen by the PAs, tPA
(tissue-type PA) and uPA. While both PAs are secreted
proteases, uPA is unique in that following secretion it binds
its cell-surface receptor (uPAR) where it is then activated,
directing proteolysis to the pericellular space (Cubellis et al.,
1986). tPA appears to be the primary PA expressed in the
intact CNS and is involved in neuronal migration and synaptic
plasticity (Seeds et al., 1997, 1999, 2003). By contrast, little
uPA expression is observed in the adult CNS in the absence of
pathology (Tsirka et al., 1997), with a single report
demonstrating uPA up-regulation in the injured spinal motor
neurons (Minor and Seeds, 2008). The clinical relevance of
this observation is substantiated by the observation of
increased uPAR expression in ECs in human cases of both
TBI (traumatic brain injury) and stroke (Beschorner et al.,
2000). Furthermore, several members of the PAS (uPA, uPAR
and PAI-1) are expressed in ECs and astrocytes within human
stroke foci (Dietzmann et al., 2000).
In conclusion, the increased TGFb signalling demonstrated
in the present study might be a double-edged sword. On one
hand, TGFb1 is known to confer neuroprotection against
various insults, including stroke (Dhandapani and Brann,
2003). However, increased TGFb signalling probably has
destabilizing actions in pathologically activated vessels, in
part via induction of both VEGF and MMP expression (ten
Dijke and Arthur, 2007). While uPA and plasmin are likely
regulators of the action of TGFb1 on spinal microvasculature
(Sato and Rifkin, 1989; Sato et al., 1990; Rainger and Nash,
2001), the present study suggests a comparable role for
regulating spinal microvascular plasticity and/or dysfunction
following SCI. Furthermore, it may be possible that the
activation of the EC compartment by TGFb may be
downstream of a yet-to-be identified cytokine cascade,
involving IL-6 and/or other growth factors. Acutely attenu-
ating the action of TGFb1 in microvessels following SCI may
have therapeutic potential.
