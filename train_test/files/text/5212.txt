Introduction
Among economists, there is a tendency to assume that a con-
fluence of economic growth and urbanization contribute to
increases in localized energy use and individual consump-
tion patterns (Lutzenhiser, 1993; Mazur, 1994; Stern, 1986).
Aggregate-level variables are occasionally used to predict
energy use fluctuations (Oh & Lee, 2004; Soytas & Sari,
2003; Suri & Chapman, 1998; York, 2007). Environmental
studies are explicitly concerned with the link between energy
usage and harmful environmental outcomes (Bennett &
Newborough, 2000; Bin & Dowlatabadi, 2005; Clement &
Schultz, 2011). In social science, economic expansion and
population growth are often utilized as predictive variables
driving energy use patterns. This article asks whether the
inverse of energy consumption (energy depletion) is associ-
ated with threatening disruptions to social order.
The focus on energy withdrawal reflects long-standing
criminological concerns regarding inequality and commu-
nity decay. Although energy use has been overlooked as a
predictive variable in macro-level criminology, recent
research (primarily in the fields of economics and geophys-
ics) suggests that there is substantial inequality across spatial
units in access to (and utilization of) affordable energy
resources (Buzar, 2007; Rosas-Flores, Gálvez, & Zayas,
2010; Spreng, 2005). Considering the emphasis traditional
criminology places on inequality in predicting aggregate pat-
terns of criminal activity, it is surprising that criminologists
have not yet evaluated such a relationship.
Work in the field of environmental sociology and geo-
physics both underscore the robust association between
energy supplies and social life and suggest energy use should
be closely correlated with quality of life indicators.1
Geophysicists who focus on energy depletion have already
suggested economic degeneration associated with energy
shortages may present challenges to socioeconomic func-
tioning and social order (Friedrichs, 2010; Hirsch, Bezdek,
& Wendling, 2005; Höök, Hirsch, & Aleklett, 2009).
If energy use relates to human quality of life (Meadows,
Meadows, & Randers, 1992), consideration should be given
to potential effects of a withdrawal of affordable energy on
various quality of life indicators, including aggregate-level
crime rates. In this article, we present a rudimentary hypoth-
esis linking aggregate energy consumption patterns with
instrumental crime rates across U.S. counties. Diverse
strands of research correspond in emphasizing the relation-
ship of energy consumption to human social life and stress
that economic expansion is impossible without expansion of
energy resources (Deffeyes, 2005; Heinberg, 2005;
Korowicz, 2010; Ruppert, 2004, 2005, 2009).
Interdependencies that arise in the production of goods and
services in today's society are built upon a fossil fuels energy
foundation (Friedrichs, 2010) and appear vulnerable to

Energy Inequality and Instrumental
Violence: An Empirical Test of a
Deductive Hypothesis
Ronald Helms1 and S. E. Costanza2
Abstract
Economic research has firmly established that energy consumption is closely linked to economic growth patterns. The subtext
of such research is that disruptions to stable supplies of affordable energy could adversely affect quality of life and interrupt
patterns of social cohesiveness. This article investigates a hypothesized link between patterns of energy consumption and
instrumental violence across 868 U.S. counties. Tobit regression results confirm an inverse association between a global
indicator of energy consumption and robbery rates, after statistically holding constant numerous theorized correlates of
crime. Results support calls for increased contingency planning in anticipation of energy-related social control challenges and
continued efforts to research and develop alternate and affordable energy.

breakdown in the presence of even relatively small disrup-
tions to stable supplies.
The term energy depletion, often utilized by peak oil theo-
rists, relates to the idea that sustainability of economic
growth is limited by constraints on the ability to consume
energy (Bentley, 2002; Cleveland, 2005; Murphy & Hall,
2011). If energy depletion scenarios become reality, several
new challenges for national and local criminal justice agen-
cies tasked with providing formal social control can be
expected. This is true especially in geographic areas that
experience the negative aspects of general inequalities and
already manifest heightened rates of violent crime. The lit-
erature on violence and inequality is extensive and provides
grist for thinking about links between natural resource dis-
parities and social control.
Literature Review
There are two areas of literature taken into consideration in
what follows. One aspect of review draws attention to arti-
cles in peer-review journals and agency technical reports that
focus on energy consumption and depletion effects. The
implications of this area of literature suggest that energy use
and quality of life indicators are likely empirically knotted
(Cook, 1971; Heinberg, 2005; Pachauri & Spreng, 2004; van
Griethuysen, 2010). If access to affordable energy resources
becomes problematic, one plausible hypothesis is that qual-
ity-of-life for people in the most energy dependent areas will
suffer.
The second body of work considered is fused from two
distinct areas of sociology: environmental sociology (that
addresses energy use) and criminology (that addresses
diverse structural determinants of aggregate-level crime
rates). Research from environmental sociology suggests
energy use is associated with varying economic conditions
(Clement & Schultz, 2011; Costanza, Farber, & Maxwell,
1989; Guy & Shove, 2000). Criminological studies have
focused intensively on documenting empirical links between
conditions of inequality and diverse indicators of crime
(Costanza & Helms, 2012; Elgar &Aitken, 2011; Kovandzic,
Vieraitis, & Yeisley, 1998; Peterson & Bailey, 1991;
Sampson & Wilson, 1995). Research efforts in these two
respective fields have rarely informed one another. This
article seeks to place them in near enough proximity to
begin the process of empirically evaluating the merits of this
hypothesized link.
Literature on Oil Depletion
The first researcher to posit that the world's petroleum sup-
ply was a finite resource was Hubbert (1956) who estimated
a mathematical model predicting a 1970 peak in continental
U.S. oil production. Although many of his contemporaries
ignored Hubbert's research, when conventional oil did peak
in 1972 (see Figure 1), economists and geologists revisited
his research, and subsequently expanded and refined the
model. Höök et al. (2009) recently developed updated esti-
mates for world oil production and their results point to a
disquieting depletion scenario (also see Campbell, 2002).
A major concern in energy literature today regards energy
inputs required to facilitate stable expansion of the economy
(Howland, Murrow, Petraglia, & Comings, 2009; Korowicz,
2010; Martenson, 2011; Meadows, Meadows, & Randers,
1992). A growing body of research articulates a straightfor-
ward insight that energy is essential to practical life in a very
concrete way, affecting the production of pharmaceuticals,
availability of transportation, development of all phases of
agricultural production, transportation, storage, and prepara-
tion, as well as virtually all aspects and phases of industrial
production, the production of media, and delivery of
education.
According to Korowicz (2010), a single barrel of crude oil
contains the equivalent in energy of a person working 40
hours a week 52 weeks a year for 12 years. The world

consumes approximately 85 million barrels of oil each day,
other energy sources notwithstanding. Drawing on standard
physics, energy use represents the ability to get work done.
The loss of even a small amount of this premium source of
energy would present substantial challenges, likely resulting
in a severe reduction in society's capacity for completing
critical work. Any such energy withdrawal would appear to
necessitate a shrinking of productive capacity.2
Heinberg (2005) emphasizes that extraction shortages in
the U.S. have been offset by an increased reliance on
imported oil and, to a lesser extent, conversion of some areas
to nuclear power. The most recent journalistic reports, avail-
able on the Internet, of the evolving nuclear disaster at
Fukishima highlights the complexity and substantial risks
associated with relying on nuclear technology to power the
global economy of the future. Absent an obvious replace-
ment for the foundational energy platform of oil, energy sup-
ply deficits are likely to undermine social stability and
impose new requirements on social control agencies3
(Heinberg, 2005).
Deffeyes (2008) explains that geophysicists and econo-
mists have worked over the past 30 years to develop a defen-
sible model for estimating the rate of oil and natural gas
depletion (Hirsch, 2005, 2008; Ruppert, 2005). Hirsch
(2005) authored a highly regarded report strongly supporting
the modeling efforts of peak oil theorists, which, in sum, has
sought to document using a variety of methodological
approaches decline rates by well, field, region, and the world
collectively. Similarly, Simmons (2005) drew on 225 techni-
cal reports and publicly available research papers from Saudi
energy experts to develop his thesis that the Saudi oil fields,
which represent approximately 20% of the total proven
reserves worldwide, were on the cusp of experiencing an
irreversible decline.
Literature on Sustainability and Natural
Resource Extraction
Heinberg (2005) emphasizes that the critical determination
relating to sustainable production of energy resources
involves what is referred to as energy return on energy
invested (EROEI). If it takes more energy than is contained
in a barrel of oil to explore and discover, extract, process,
refine, store, and transport that barrel of oil to market, then
that barrel will not be extracted. He argues that this relation-
ship between the energy return on energy investments affects
production processes at the level of individual wells, fields,
producing countries, regions, and for the world collectively.
Concurrent literature (King & Fritsch, 2008) suggests that
pricing for oil products influences the rate of investment to
discover new sources of oil, but new discoveries have
remained flat for many years while physical depletion of
existing resources has expanded annually. Greenham (2012),
drawing from an investment model of causation, asserts that
slowing the decline in the availability of oil will require a
doubling of the price of oil in the next decade. Greenham
refers to the phenomenon of "economic peak oil," which he
defines as "the point at which the cost of incremental supply
exceeds the price economies can pay without significantly
disrupting economic activity at a given point in time." He
continues, saying that "Beyond this `pain barrier,' the level
of oil prices will have a dramatic effect on a nation's people
and its economy, threatening stagnation and hardship." We
concur with this conceptualization, noting that geological
physicists with their emphasis on underground forces, energy
researchers with their focus on EROEI, and those emphasiz-
ing economic peak oil all point to a similarly distressing
future characterized by a diminishing supply of easily acces-
sible and affordable liquid fuels based energy, the driving
force in any modern economy.
Worldwide estimates for liquid fuels show a peak in avail-
ability at or about 2006 to 2007. Demand for energy sources
has been increasing at a spectacular pace.4 All of the previ-
ously cited energy researchers seem to concur that the 21st
century will herald the opening of a gap between expanding
world demand for new energy and a moderately declining
available supply. A variety of monographs and peer reviewed
articles in the field of geophysics point to anticipated diffi-
culties for population groups and their respective govern-
ments under this scenario (Deffeyes, 2005; Heinberg, 2005;
Korowicz, 2010; McBay, 2006).
Limitations in Environmental Sociology
Environmental sociologists have noted the link between
energy consumption patterns and global inequalities
(Clement, 2010) drawing attention to ecological dimensions
of inequality. The following quote from a recent article sums
up the way that sociologists have viewed energy consump-
tion: "The point needs to be made that urbanization drives
energy use not just because it amplifies economic activity
but also because human activity, in general, is heightened in
urbanized areas" (Clement & Schultz, 2011, p. 587). We
agree, but note that the social science literature never directly
empirically evaluates conceptual links between energy
resources and shifting requirements for effective social
control.
In sociological literature, energy use is usually explained
as a function of population growth (Meadows et al., 1992),
economic growth (Paul & Bhattacharya, 2004) and often as a
logical cause of environmental pollutants (Alam, Bala, Huq,
& Matin, 1991). Environmental sociology squarely focuses
on economic growth relative to energy usage (Cheng, 1995;
Chontanawat, Hunt, & Pierse, 2008; Hondroyiannis, Lolos,
& Papapetrou, 2002; Lee & Chang, 2008). What is missed by
environmental sociology are the ancillary concerns of crimi-
nology; the functioning of communities and the conse-
quences of a negative rate of growth. There is some
consideration to the issue of global inequality relative to
accessing energy (Bunker, 1985; Parks & Roberts, 2010), but
4 SAGE Open
even in this research, there is little evident consideration of
quality of life effects associated with anticipated energy
withdrawals.
The upshot of environmental sociology is that it empha-
sizes diverse ecological resource disparities and their conse-
quences for social functioning. Bunker (1985), for example,
argues that third world countries struggle with comparatively
massive drains in resources and energy when attempting to
compete with industrial core nations on the export market.
As noted previously, for most energy researchers, energy use
drives urbanization because it augments economic activity
(Lee & Chang, 2008). Energy consumption has been asserted
as a predictive variable of air pollution and economic GDP
(Lutzenhiser, 1993) but the lines between inequality in the
consumption of energy and area crime have not previously
been conceptualized and studied empirically. We address this
gap in the literature with an analysis of the effects of energy
consumption patterns on instrumental crime in the United
States.
Crime and Inequality Literature
Infinite growth cannot continue unabated in a finite world
and when conditions supporting such expansion hit their
peak and thereafter become less available at affordable
prices, there will undoubtedly be environmental and crimi-
nological consequences that follow. Standard macro-level
criminological literature has provided myriad predictive
variables in the attempt to account for variation in rates of
crime. Much of the aggregate crime research emphasizes
concepts such as poverty, cultural capital, and various dimen-
sions of social inequality. Despite this focus, inequality of
access to affordable energy has never been studied directly as
a predictor of aggregate crime. This is surprising, as energy
use patterns have been linked so closely to economic growth
and quality of life in environmental sociological research.
We note, parenthetically, that the introduction of new vari-
ables into criminology has been rare over the last 40 years.
Taking as a point of departure insights from the inequal-
ity-crime research, this article evaluates a hypothesized
inverse association between aggregate energy use and vio-
lence rates. The potential effects of structured inequality on
aggregate crime rates has been tenaciously debated
(Greenberg, Kessler, & Loftin, 1985; Patterson, 1991;
Sampson, Morenoff, & Raudenbush, 2005). Aggregate
income inequality (Hipp, 2007; Hooghe,Vanhoutte, Hardyns,
& Bircan, 2011), unemployment (Cantor & Land, 1985;
Chiricos, 1987), housing (Greenberg, 1985; Sampson et al.,
2005), and education (Lochner & Moretti, 2004; Meghir,
Palme, & Schnabel, 2012), among other predictors have all
been conceptualized and operationalized as sources of crime
variation. Structural research has also focused on race, eco-
nomic inequality, and other social disadvantage indicators
but the empirical results have often been characterized by
mixed or contradictory findings (McCall, Land, & Parker,
2010; Pridemore & Trent, 2010). Perhaps the most consistent
finding is in the race-crime area of research, with most stud-
ies reporting a positive race effect (Kovandzic, Vieraitis, &
Yeisley, 1998; Liska, Sanchirico, & Reed, 1998; Messner,
1983; Parker & Pruitt, 2000).5
Economic inequality has been the focus of violence
research (J. R. Blau & Blau, 1982; Jacobs & Richardson,
2008), but findings have been mixed (Messner, 1982, 1983;
Messner & Tardiff, 1985). Poverty is also seen as an impor-
tant crime correlate (Bailey, 1984; Messner, 1983; Messner,
Raffalovich,&Sutton,2010;Williams,1984).Unemployment
has been theorized as a key source of "economic-induced
strain" (Parker & McCall, 1999, p. 464), and may contribute
to patterned violence, but the evidence, as in other areas of
crime research, has been inconsistent. Kapuscinski,
Braithwaite, and Chapman (1998) report that unemployment
is not associated with homicide rates. Cantor and Land
(1985) report mixed results, whereas Parker and McCall
(1999) and Kovandzic et al. (1998) report significant unem-
ployment effects on violence rates. City size has also been
statistically held constant in most instrumental violence
research (Parker & McCall, 1999; Shihadeh & Ousey, 1998;
Williams, 1984) with similarly mixed results.
Social Disorganization and Theoretical
Links
A review of social disorganization literature provides foun-
dation for many of the theoretical links that are advanced in
this article. Prior studies have documented a link between
energy use and the economy; we suspect that energy con-
sumption is an important correlate with social cohesiveness
and collective efficacy in neighborhoods. In communities
that have experienced decay, economic deprivation is often
thought to significantly influence variation in violence pat-
terns and social control responses (Costanza & Helms, 2012;
Costanza, Kilburn, & Miles, 2013; Helms & Costanza, 2009,
2010; Jones-Webb & Wall, 2010; McCall, Parker, &
MacDonald, 2008; Skogan, 1990; Stark, 1987). Disorganized
neighborhoods are often substantially disenfranchised, hav-
ing limited control over the actions of neighborhood resi-
dents and limited ability to influence the decisions of
politicians and actions of police (Kaylen & Pridemore,
2013). Poverty, family disruption, restricted labor markets,
social and economic marginalization, and political disenfran-
chisement have all been linked to violence rates in urban
jurisdictions in the United States (Jacobs & Richardson,
2008; Jorgenson, Rice, & Clark, 2010).
Social disorganization studies do not characterize the
diverse array of deprivations as having a natural and immu-
table source, but rather these are seen as politically and
socially determined. In the following sections, we seek to
develop a research approach that emphasizes this critical
energy-crime connection. We do not ignore previous research
concerns, but rather, we seek to develop a more complete
Helms and Costanza 5
account by conceptualizing and then assessing correlational
evidence regarding energy inequality effects on patterns of
instrumental crime in U.S. counties.
Theory and Hypotheses
Across communities, patterns of energy consumption vary
substantially. Structural inequality studies (with their focus
on skewing of advantages and concentration of community-
level violence) are suggestive for the purposes of research
developed here. We propose that the skewed ability to con-
sume energy represents a facet of social inequality. We
hypothesize criminal consequences associated with this dis-
parate consumption of energy resources.
The research presented below advances a social ecologi-
cal explanation of crime to explain variance in street robbery
rates across counties. Concepts addressed in this article
extend beyond traditionally used indicators of disorganiza-
tion, as we seek to address the broader issue of energy con-
sumption and how it relates to crime. When discussing
energy consumption, we address the fundamental link
between areas and resources and note that certain geographic
regions are energy rich while others are energy poor
(Jorgenson et al., 2010). We focus first on the energy-com-
munity violence hypothesis and then proceed with other
widely utilized controls from the extant literature on com-
munities and crime.
Energy Consumption and Instrumental Violence
Geological physicists have for many years provided monthly
updates to the world energy picture, based on rigorous mod-
eling efforts. The ASPO (Association for the Study of Peak
Oil & Gas­Irish Chapter, n.d.), in an extensive collection of
100 published newsletters, has demonstrated that oil and
related liquid fuels are becoming increasingly scarce and
more difficult to process at a reasonable investment cost.
Advanced industrial societies can anticipate reductions in
living standards resulting from the peak energy scarcity situ-
ation (Friedrichs, 2010).
Such reasoning finds anecdotal corroboration with the
journalistic linkage between sudden resource shortfalls and
violence, and draws from observations surrounding natural
disasters (Van Heerden & Bryan, 2006). Research docu-
ments how populations respond to abrupt and protracted dis-
ruptions in flows of energy and other related critical resources
(Brinkley, 2006; Van Heerden & Bryan, 2006). The peak oil
thesis implies an evolving structural set of problems with
substantial social control implications, a set of problems that
amount to what one author has referred to as a "long emer-
gency" (Kunstler, 2007, p. 123).
Any substantial disruption to a stable supply of energy
(regardless of the source of that disruption) would be a
deeply influential determinant in the overall crime patterns
of any American community. Critical to this notion is the
understanding that this model does not depend on the truth
of the geological resource scarcity model to predict deleteri-
ous effects for any area faced with reduced access to energy.
Given the link between energy consumption and community
economic well-being in the United States, any disruption to
stable and affordable energy due to either above ground
(political) or below ground (geological) causes would (in
due course) necessitate a community reset to a reduced living
standard.
With the foregoing considerations in mind, one plausible
hypothesis stemming from this thesis is as follows: the
inability of areas to access and consume energy resources at
reasonable cost can be expected to produce aggregated risks
of instrumental forms of social expression, including pat-
terns of heightened disorder and crime. Energy consumption
patterns across units should be inversely associated with
respective rates of instrumental crimes.
Additional Conceptual Controls
Many variables have been assessed for their empirical asso-
ciation with instrumental violence in previous research.
Along with the skewed ability to consume energy, several
factors are likely to be predictive of aggregate crime pat-
terns, and so it is appropriate to statistically control for these
in the presence of the energy consumption indicator. The
logic for these statistical controls follows.
Concentrated Disadvantage
Concentrated disadvantage has been a widely utilized con-
cept and predictor variable in violence research. Literature
on violence highlights several conceptually distinct (but
empirically overlapping) structural factors that should be sta-
tistically held constant to increase the precision of estimated
effects. Land, McCall, and Cohen (1990) emphasized over-
lapping features of social structure that have been linked
with community disorganization and crime. The basic insight
is that overlapping features of social inequality are constitu-
tive of a condition that increases the propensity for violence
across neighborhoods and communities. Conditions includ-
ing race, poverty, and income inequality have been shown to
exhibit overlapping effects on violence rates in previous
studies (Hagan, 1997; Morenoff, Sampson, & Raudenbush,
2001; Ousey & Lee, 2002; Wilson, 1987). We follow the
practice of previous structural research in constructing a
combined indicator of concentrated disadvantage. We expect
the following: In counties where an indicator of concen-
trated disadvantage is heightened, the rate of instrumental
violence should be expanded.
Unemployment
Unemployment has been the focus of a great deal of research
relating to punishment (Chiricos & Delone, 1992). The
6 SAGE Open
relationship extended to instrumental violence (robbery) is
straightforward. Where unemployment is heightened, there
is more pressure to resolve economic strain through redis-
tributive violence. Jacobs and Helms (1997) draw on insights
from Blau (1964), arguing that "redistributive violence is
one method the dependent can be expected to use to over-
come their disadvantaged position in unbalanced exchange
relationships" (p. 1365). Parker and McCall (1999) argue as
well that a high unemployment rate contributes to reduced
legitimate opportunities and may result in "economic-
induced strain" (p. 464). If this argument has merit, we
expect the following: Heightened unemployment should be a
positive correlate with instrumental crime. But where the
unemployment rate is reduced, crime should be curtailed.
Black/White Median Household Incomes
Two alternative models have been prevalent in studying the
relationship between racial income ratios and violence. A
conflict hypothesis sees greater inequality resulting in the
heightening of criminal patterns of economic redistribution,
here operationalized as robberies. In this model, greater dis-
parity in incomes, representing minority disempowerment in
relationship to Whites, would be a factor shaping robbery
patterns. And so we expect to observe a negative sign on the
coefficient. Alternatively, a racial competition model con-
ceptualizes that as Blacks approach parity with Whites, a
range of social difficulties tends to take shape. This would
likely be a consequence of greater direct competition for eco-
nomic resources and shifts in status differentials across racial
groups, as well as the separation of middle-class Blacks from
an increasingly concentrated class of minorities who have
been economically marginalized. A consequence of rising
expectations is the tendency for violence as expectations are
not fully (and equally) gratified. In this competition model,
the relative equalizing of group social power should heighten
competition over the distribution of limited resources and
may trigger diffuse mechanisms that contribute to and result
in heightened rates of robbery. In other words, we would
expect to observe a positive coefficient if the competition
model is supported.
Household Instability
Informal controls are plausibly weakened by rapid turnover
in any community. Early social ecology literature recognized
the degrading influences associated with population turnover
as local communities attempted to establish governing norms
(Sampson, Raudenbush, & Earls, 1997; Shaw & McKay,
1942). To address these concerns, we include a statistical
control that seeks to isolate influences for a widely recog-
nized dimension of neighborhood stability, household moves
in the last 5 years. Areas with high turnover should on aver-
age be less able to informally govern public spaces and con-
trol economically marginalized members. One expected
result of this weakening of informal social control is that in
areas with higher rates of household moves, we should see
heightened rates of robbery. But in areas characterized by
greater household stability, the robbery rates should be
reduced.
Population Size
Larger populations produce more interpersonal exchanges
and provide greater opportunities for crime as more potential
targets are available for victimization. Highly populated
areas also allow individuals to remain anonymous and so
may be related to lower societal control on criminal activities
and situations that may result in violence (Felson, 1995). All
of these factors suggest that population size should be related
to the level of violence, and so we include population as a
statistical control. Larger populations should be associated
with heightened rates of crime, while less populated counties
should experience reduced crime.
The Strength of Police Forces
Finally, policing has been theorized as providing a deterrent
effect but research has to date failed to provide unambiguous
evidence in support of the deterrence hypothesis (Walker &
Katz, 2011; Wiley & Esbensen, 2013). More plausibly, police
are most concentrated in areas with heightened social control
contingencies (Helms, 2007, 2008). We note that communi-
ties most affected by social and economic marginalization
are generally areas that most strongly utilize police services.
Moreover, these same areas may have strong political inter-
ests in maintaining reserve capacity to address socially
threatening disruptions with enhanced police-administered
violence. With this in mind, we posit a positive empirical
link between area police resources and crime. As police are
hired to provide routine service while also providing reserve
capacity to manage social threats, it would not be surprising
to find that personnel are most concentrated in the most
crime-prone areas. Formally, we expect that the strength of
police forces will be closely correlated with the crime rate. In
other words, we expect to observe a positive association
between police (whose presence affords reserve capacity to
handle serious disruptions to social stability while also
remaining responsive to ordinary demands for service in
high demand areas) and patterns of instrumental crime.
Regional Dummies
We control for regional effects with a series of dummies. In
the various models, we include dummy indicators for the
Northeast, Midwest, and South, with the Western region
serving as the omitted (reference) category. A dummy
approach is useful because regions may differ substantially
in terms of their respective cultures and economic require-
ments even as jurisdictions within any region remain
Helms and Costanza 7
relatively similar to each other. Moreover, a dummy approach
can assist in reducing spatial autocorrelation (for an addi-
tional statement to this effect, see Helms, 2009). Finally, the
inclusion of regional dummies can be expected to capture
systematic influences on the robbery rates indicator that are
otherwise unmeasured and untheorized. For all of these rea-
sons, we include regional dummy indicators in the analyses
below.
Method
Research Design, Sample, Dependent Variable,
and Method
This study uses a cross-sectional research design and sample
data on 868 U.S. counties to assess diverse correlates of
instrumental crime.6 The dependent variable in this study is
the per capita rate of robbery. Information used to construct
the robbery rate indicator was taken from the Uniform Crime
Report, published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for
the year 2001. As the per capita rate exhibits positive skew,
we logged the indicator. As some counties reported 0s, we
added a 1 prior to logging. Therefore, the indicator used in
the analysis below is the natural log of the rate of robberies
(+1). We note here that robbery is an instrumental crime cen-
tered on the acquisition of resources, and it is also a crime
involving either force or the threat of force and so it is an
event that involves substantial risks as well as the potential
for economic rewards. Robbery is a particularly relevant
focus for this research because the primary thesis focuses on
the role of inequality in energy consumption in the produc-
tion of crime.
The robbery indicator, we note, has characteristics of left
censoring.7 When an outcome variable is characterized by
the presence of 0s, this may result in estimation difficulties
that cannot be easily remedied using standard ordinary least
squares (OLS). In such a data analytic situation, one alterna-
tive is to explicitly model the presence of left censoring with
a Tobit model (StataCorp, 2008). In the analysis that follows,
we assess statistical results produced using a Tobit estima-
tion procedure.
Independent Indicators
Independent variables used in this analysis were taken from
the U.S. 2000 Census and were merged with other data
sources. The energy use indicator is an aggregate estimate of
total energy consumption from all sources measured in tril-
lions of British Thermal Units. Data used to construct this
indicator were taken from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration. We standardized the indicator, dividing by
total population and multiplying by a constant. To correct for
positive skew, the indicator is logged.
Social disorganization indicators were constructed by
combining U.S. 2000 census data and U.S. Bureau of
Economic Analysis data. Structural researchers have
increasingly focused on a confluence of variables that
together have been linked with socially disadvantaged condi-
tions (Helms & Costanza, 2010; Land et al., 1990; Sampson
& Wilson, 1995; Wilson, 1987). We follow convention and
use a constructed indicator of concentrated disadvantage
based on the results of an un-rotated principal components
analysis.
Strong factor loadings on indicators for poverty, percent
Black population, and the Gini coefficient computed on fam-
ily incomes indicated substantial overlap in the regression
space; therefore, these indicators were used to construct the
combined index of concentrated disadvantage. In addition,
unemployment is operationalized as the percent unemployed
as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The popu-
lation indicator exhibited skew and so it is logged.
Neighborhood instability is measured as the percentage of
households that experienced a move in the past 5 years.
Racial economic inequality is operationalized with a ratio
indicator of Black to White median household incomes.
Police and Regional Variation Indicators
Police capacity was operationalized with an indicator of the
number of badged deputies per 10,000 county population.
We rescaled the indicator by applying a natural log to address
positive skew. Regional variation is addressed with a series
of dummies. We follow convention and develop dummy
indicators for the four major regions (South, Northeast,
Midwest, and West). The West is treated as the reference or
omitted category in the analyses.
The basic model should result in positive coefficients on
indicators of concentrated disadvantage, unemployment,
household instability, and population size. Also, for reasons
noted above, the police rate should exhibit a positive and sig-
nificant effect on the robbery rate. We are agnostic regarding
the sign of the coefficient on the Black­White median
income indicator; the energy consumption indicator should
exhibit an inverse relationship with the dependent variable.
State dummies are not explicitly theorized and may take
either a positive or negative sign in the analyses.
Analyses
Preliminary Analysis of Data
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for all of the indicators
used in the analyses. Table 2 includes zero-order correla-
tions. We note that correlations among the respective inde-
pendent variables are all modest. Table 3 includes estimates
for three alternative specifications of the robbery rates model.
The first model focuses on the energy consumption-instru-
mental violence hypothesis. Model 2 retains the energy indi-
cator but includes diverse indicators from the social
disorganization literature and also the police rate. In the final
model, all of the foregoing indicators are retained and
regional dummies are introduced.

Results: County-Level Influences on Instrumental
Violence Rates
The first model presented in Table 3 provides initial evidence
of a significant inverse association between the energy con-
sumption indicator and the dependent variable (-3.90**).
This result offers confirmation that areas experiencing a high
level of per capita energy consumption are linked with
reduced rates of localized instrumental violence. This impor-
tant result, however, must be treated tentatively because the
model does not contain any of the plausible social disorgani-
zation controls theorized above. We note that the overall
model is significant (2 = 15.14**), but the pseudo R2 for the
model is rather small (.005), implying that only the barest
amount of variance appears to have been accounted for with
this specification. Having said this, we note that the signifi-
cant likelihood ratio chi-square tells us that our model as a
whole fits significantly better than an empty model (i.e., a
model with no predictors).
Model 2 introduces an array of theoretically plausible
controls into the instrumental crime model. After having
expanded the model, we note the persistence of the energy-
robbery rates empirical link. The tabled results in Model 2
again prove consistent with the energy withdrawal-instru-
mental violence hypothesis. Across the sample, counties
with the highest levels of energy consumption experienced
the lowest rates of robbery (-3.38**). After introducing the
series of social disorganization and police rate indicators, we
find that the overall model is much improved (2 = 752.18**;
pseudo R2 = .275). Model 2 shows support for a variety of
additional hypotheses. The sworn police rate exhibits a sig-
nificant positive effect (1.91*) suggesting that augmented
law enforcement services are closely correlated with height-
ened crime. The combined indicator of concentrated disad-
vantage exhibits a close positive association with violent
crime in many empirical studies and this result is reproduced
here as the indicator is highly significant with a positive sign
(15.17**). Population size (17.37**) and Neighborhood
Instability (7.97**) also are each shown to exhibit a positive
and highly significant association with the dependent vari-
able. The coefficient for the Black/White income ratio is sig-
nificant and exhibits an inverse association with the robbery
rate (-5.50**). According to our conceptualization of this
indicator, the result is most consistent with a conflict hypoth-
esis. Where inequality is greatest economic stress and related
social tensions likely contribute to expanded criminal redis-
tribution of scarce and valued resources. One surprise in the
analysis is associated with the unemployment indicator.
Rather than exhibiting the expected positive association,
implying that the presence of larger unemployed populations
would be a predictor of increased instrumental crime, we
observed the opposite effect. The percentage of the labor
force currently experiencing unemployment is a negative
predictor of the robbery rate (-3.29**). One possible expla-
nation for this result is linked to unemployment benefits as a
factor reducing immediate economic stresses for recently
unemployed individuals. In addition, those recently unem-
ployed are most likely strongly tied to labor market processes
(in other words, informal controls on behavior) and may be
unlikely candidates for street robbery in the absence of quite
strong catalyzing circumstances. On the other side of the
equation is the effect of unemployment on the circulation of
people with economic resources. Heightened unemployment
may be a factor that actually reduces the circulation of lucra-
tive targets (individuals with cash and other material posses-
sions)inopportunisticsocialenvironmentssuchasdowntown
bars, sporting events, and other inviting settings for crime.
But the effect extends to others who may feel economic anxi-
ety, and therefore curtail their own social activities. The net
result of these processes might be a reduction in criminal
opportunities and thus a reduced rate of instrumental crimes.
The empirical results of this study appear consistent with
such alternative theorizing concerning the unemployment-
crime link.
Model 3 retains all of the previously discussed indicators
and introduces regional dummies into the Tobit model in the
attempt to further assess the effects of energy inequality on
instrumental crime rates. The overall model appears slightly
enhanced with the introduction of the regional dummy vari-
ables (2 = 797.76**; pseudo R2 = .292). The energy con-
sumption indicator remains a strong negative predictor of
area robbery rates (-3.00**). All of the previously discussed
indicators remain significant with consistent signs on the
coefficients. The respective dummy indicators represent rel-
ative mean differences when compared with the omitted cat-
egory (West region). All of the dummy indicators are
significant, implying that these areas of the country experi-
ence significantly heightened rates of robbery relative to the
Western region, holding constant a diverse array of structural
indicators.
With regard to our focal hypothesis, the inclusion of con-
textual controls in Model 2 and then regional dummies in
Model 3 resulted in only modest changes in the estimated

coefficient. This result is reassuring because it suggests that
diverse specifications of the robbery model produce stable
estimates on the key hypothesized relationship. The only
notable differences in results across Models 2 and 3 are a
slight reduction in the unemployment coefficient and corre-
sponding significance level (dropping from .01 to .05) and an
enhanced coefficient and significance level on the police rate
indicator.
What makes for a most interesting discussion is that other
indicators drawn from the research on crime proved signifi-
cant in the various models but did not eliminate the relation-
ship between patterns of energy consumption and
instrumental violence. The estimated coefficient for an index
of concentrated disadvantage proved positive and statisti-
cally significant in this model. Counties characterized by
substantial social hardship and economic disadvantage
apparently experienced heightened rates of instrumental
crime. Both the population indicator and indicator of house-
hold instability exhibited positive and significant associa-
tions with the robbery rates as anticipated in the theory
section. More heavily populated counties and counties with a
greater percentage of households experiencing recent moves
were both associated with heightened instrumental crimes.
Areas characterized by larger populations and greater popu-
lation movements apparently are welcoming environments
for robbery because these conditions foster anonymity that
favors criminal actors in selecting targets, timing attacks, and
facilitating escape from the scene of the confrontation.
The Black/White income ratio in this model is significant
and exhibits a negative sign on the coefficient, yet does not
undermine the effects of the energy consumption indicator.
We note that this result is evident after isolating important
theorized structural controls that have been extensively con-
ceptualized and evaluated in the crime research. Although
regional dummies are all significant predictors of instrumen-
tal violence in the third model, they do not obscure the sig-
nificant relationship between energy consumption and
instrumental violence patterns. This provides for interesting
speculation, as certain areas of the country are thought to be
more dependent on gas, oil, coal, or hydroelectric resources.
Ostensibly, the relationship between energy consumption
and violence should have been nullified while controlling for
the effects of regions, as it is known that there is tremendous
variability in access to respective sources of energy across
areas, and particularly regions. In fact, after controlling for
regional variation and a diverse set of structural controls and

a measure of police availability for service, a global measure
of energy consumption is shown to be a strong correlate of
instrumental violence. Areas with greater utilization of
energy resources (our global indicator captures all sources
including personal and household use, transportation, public,
and industrial uses among other uses within any area) are
associated with reduced instrumental violence but areas less
able to effectively utilize energy resources to address social
demand for goods and services were associated with height-
ened rates of instrumental violence.
Limitations of the Data
Before proceeding to conclusions, it is necessary to discuss
various limitations inherent in this analysis. The data include
observations from a single year and may not accurately cap-
ture the volatile dynamics of energy or crime. Using cross-
sectional data, we must infer causal connections that are
inherently time dependent by observing variation across
units at a single point in time. We acknowledge this limita-
tion and strongly encourage other researchers to develop
multi-year data to advance this hypothesized link between
energy inequality and community violence. We also acknowl-
edge limitations in the generality of our findings both with
regard to the United States as a whole and to areas beyond
the United States. The data used in this research represents a
sample of the large number of counties in the United States
and these were originated by their sources for diverse pur-
poses, not the least of which included the study of police
administration (i.e., Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics [LEMAS] data from the Federal
Government). The questions animating original data collec-
tion efforts and sampling methodologies across data collec-
tion projects may have produced biases that we are unaware
of as consumers of secondary data.
Regarding comparisons with processes in areas beyond
the United States, we note that Muntaner, Lynch, and Smith
(2001) have pointed out that neighborhood dynamics vary
from country to country. In some countries, the state is the
prime arbiter of economic redistribution, while in other
nations there may be common enemies that force social
cohesion. Zureik (1988), for example, pointed out that in
areas such as Palestine where value systems differ traditional
theories of deviance may not apply. We note as well that
social welfare and health and retirement systems vary sub-
stantially across countries. All of these considerations may
mediate the effects of energy consumption patterns on rates
of instrumental crime.
This only serves to highlight the fact that the present
research pursues insight concerning a tentative hypothesis
and provides analysis of this conceptualized relationship for
one advanced society. It would be presumptuous to assert
generality beyond the units under study. Indeed, we hope that
this inquiry will stimulate additional assessment of the thesis
using alternative methods and perhaps cross-national data to
assess the generality of these findings.
Finally, we note that the time period under study offers a
conservative test of the thesis because the pricing of oil was
relatively inexpensive at the time of the study's data genera-
tion and citizens in the United States had not yet encountered
the full discourse on terror and associated resource wars that
ensued over the following decade. We strongly encourage
further research into this thesis because these questions, in
our view, are of critical importance to society; we are on the
cusp of a period of uncertainty because resources are
expected to become increasingly scarce and the struggle over
access to and control of resources is expected to escalate.
Conclusion
Economists tend to view efficiency gains related to energy
consumption favorably. Utilization of fossil fuels facilitates
economic expansion. Economic expansion is thought to be a
factor in the stabilization of communities. Stable communi-
ties experience lower crime rates. Although it may be a bitter
pill to swallow, social scientists (especially criminologists)
must eventually come to terms with the importance of natu-
ral resource extraction on community safety and well-being.
There are some very practical examples of this link in action
that we see in everyday life. Energy is essential to all facets
of modern urban life, including maintaining police forces
and implementing various initiatives that seek to stabilize
communities. Central to this analysis is the realization that
stable economic expansion under current conditions of
extreme complexity and economic interdependence requires
perpetual expansion of energy inputs. We note as well the
critical role energy plays in the growth of the economy as
represented in the system of money and the issuing of debt
(for a full review of this aspect, see Martenson, 2011).
The widening gap between available energy at a low cost
and demand for energy under conditions of economic expan-
sion may one day result in a failure of supply to meet demand.
The practical result of this realization is that for economi-
cally marginalized areas the ability to deliver goods and ser-
vices must reflect that shortage. For communities on the
economic margins, this means that some goods and services
will become less available for consumption if there is a fail-
ure to continue to supply local economic processes.
The situation proposed is somewhat similar to the with-
drawal of industry from any given area. For communities,
the worst-case scenario may be the increasing presence of
poverty for ever larger percentages of the local population,
and, for those who cannot gain access to the most basic level
of resources, starvation or freezing to death from lack of
electrical, steam, or gas heating. Another possibility is that
individuals will innovate and turn to criminal behavior to
ensure basic needs are met. If such a scenario plays itself out,
one would expect an uncertain social environment and per-
ceived need to incorporate defensive strategies to mitigate
criminal risks. That said, we note that even though we cannot
predict on a given day (or on a given street corner) what
person will engage in a robbery, we can certainly develop
Helms and Costanza 11
insights concerning aggregate patterns of robbery. The
empirical results of the foregoing study provide preliminary
evidence consistent with the hypothesized energy with-
drawal-instrumental violence association.
Although these alternative futures may appear distant and
unlikely to the educated and socially mobile reader, the
proven depletion of oil energy reserves may already have
asserted itself into community. The American landscape is
replete with bust-towns that once relied on natural resource
extraction to drive the local economy. However, when con-
sidering the fate of such places, it should be pointed out that
oil-depletion would eventually reach into all communities,
not just those that are currently or have been in the past sub-
ject to economic and social dislocation. In this context, we
strongly encourage readers to access and review the excel-
lent summary by Korowicz (2010) on the relationship
between an exponentially growing demand for energy and
the stable functioning of the complex and highly interdepen-
dent just-in-time delivery systems that support the function-
ing economy.
Although political venues are continually in flux, the
socioeconomic impact of inequality that correlates with vio-
lent crime appears stable. Energy distribution as it is viewed
here represents a distinct dimension of inequality, a general
concern that has been firmly established in the literature on
crime. The foregoing analysis provides evidence of an
empirical link between a global indicator of resource inequal-
ity and patterns of increased violent crime. In future research,
we may seek to find what aspects of energy distribution are
specifically linked to community development and enhanced
quality of life. But for now, it would behoove civic leaders to
seek changes in policy that would address future inequalities
in the distribution of energy. The price of oil has risen to
more than US$100 a barrel and current political machina-
tions such as the "war on terror" have substantially factored
into the resource supply equation. This is readily observable
in the U.S. government's sustained expansion of a world-
wide-militarized presence, with a notable focus on energy
resource-rich areas. But we also observe political decisions
favorable to private investments in fracking technologies,
development of ethanol, deep water drilling, and exploration
of the far reaches of the North Pole in the milieu of melting
ice sheets, among other energy development supports.
In consideration of the heightening strain on the global-
ized energy system (associated with both geological and
political forces), we note escalating security developments at
home and abroad and speculate that law enforcement and
correctional agencies are very likely to experience a tighten-
ing of resources that will hamper administration and plan-
ning for emergent social control challenges. One plausible
approach is to prepare for anticipated crises in the criminal
justice system and wider communities by articulating poli-
cies that focus on the impact of energy distribution within
communities.8 The reality is that the federal government
appears preoccupied with other matters. The overextension
of the United States in world military conflicts has been
matched with domestic developments sustained over many
years in the form of a buildup of militarized police forces
(Kraska, 1999, 2007; Kraska & Cubellis, 1997). The recent
lockdown of Boston, Massachusetts (in response to the
recent bombing at the annual Boston Marathon), and the
international crisis stemming from Edward Snowden's whis-
tle-blowing regarding National Security Agency (NSA)
monitoring of electronic transactions and communications
are indicators that the U.S. government is currently highly
sensitized to state security. But there has been a marked fail-
ure to address the nation's overwhelming reliance on fossil
fuels or to take obvious steps in redirecting government
resources to develop meaningful alternatives.
There are several recommendations for contingency plan-
ning in the presence of predictable social developments asso-
ciated with energy scarcity in the near term. We have
highlighted that reduced energy consumption is linked with
reductions in the scale of economic functioning. We have
also noted that according to several experts, the primary cat-
alyst for economic growth (oil) is being depleted. Radical
policy addressing alternatives to oil and fossil fuels are a
gambit that the U.S. federal government does not appear
willing to risk. However, results presented in this article
clearly would seem to support development of solar, wind,
and hydroelectric power if America is to counter rising
energy costs and also, incidentally, may be a factor in miti-
gating the risk of rising violent crime rates.
It seems pertinent to focus intensively on developing fed-
eral policies that address more than just the symptoms of the
problem. If global oil shortages are a phenomenon that will
play out over the life of the current or next generation, surely
this development will manifest in concrete difficult realities.
Such realities we can expect might include reductions in eco-
nomic security, diminished employment opportunities, and a
decline in the effectiveness of public sector services such as
schooling and other assistance programs.
During the 1930s, several policies were developed to
begin to address social welfare needs and thereby allay fears
and create hope among the generation suffering through the
Great Depression. Backers of these policies were accused of
being "communists." The emergence of an extensive social
welfare safety net was delayed by the emergent affluence of
the postwar era. In anticipation of evolving structural prob-
lems due in part to energy depletion, the state could take
advantage of its ability to marshal resources and target such
policies with an eye toward extracting the meritorious fea-
tures of previously attempted social welfare assistance. We
note in this context that the federal government has an ability
to extract usable resources and target their uses in ways that
are unmatched by local governments and private interests
(Peterson, 1981).
Finally, we point out the need to develop police and com-
munity response options to prepare for and confront the
human and social consequences of energy scarcity. Recent
12 SAGE Open
developments in the criminal justice profession reflect a
growing awareness of the limits of economic and budgetary
expansion. In addition to the corrections system beginning to
question the utility of mass incarceration for non-violent
crimes, policing has changed as well. Currently, most fed-
eral, state, and local agencies list as part of their mission
statement the need to respond to the possibility of terrorist
actions. Fortunately, along with martial developments, there
have been some very positive changes in the organization of
police services that reflect a pro-social orientation concern-
ing the police role. Obviously, there are potential threats and
opportunities present in both of these developments, both for
law enforcement and for the communities they serve.
Coercion when held in reserve has a powerful effect on com-
pliance with legitimate authority edicts. But coercion alone
will never suffice in controlling an angry and desperate pop-
ulation in the face of resource shortages. Police and local
officials need to work closely with local citizens to develop
systems of resilience and support in advance of anticipated
problems. This is a generally good idea for any enlightened
leadership, but it is critical in the presence of sustained pro-
cesses of declining resources, a condition anticipated by
researchers who study energy and limits on future energy
availability.
We wholeheartedly invite crime and justice researchers to
evaluate with other data and modeling techniques the empiri-
cal and conceptual links developed in this article. This is par-
ticularly true with regard to the energy indicator and its
relationship to social order and related concerns about social
control. We can hope that a pandemic crisis will be averted
by miraculous as yet un-invented technologies, but should
always ponder new areas of insight. The failure to articulate
this area of discourse could leave citizens and governing
officials (as well as researchers themselves) confounded at
the rapid scale of changes and also misinformed about plau-
sible links between social conflict and resource limits both at
home and abroad. We strongly encourage research by aca-
demics and attention to these issues in both federal and local
policy arenas. With empirically grounded insight, we can
hope to counter the worst possible outcomes and contribute
to greater effectiveness of response in the face of a rapidly
unfolding and highly uncertain future.

Notes
1. Various reports (e.g., Hirsch, Bezdek, & Wendling, 2005,
2010) have already done the difficult work of marshaling com-
pelling evidence that the peaking and subsequent decline of
liquid fuels will result in unrivaled difficulties throughout the
world for modern governments and the societies they govern.
As we note in the main text, Korowicz (2010) takes these and
other similar studies as a point of departure while pointing
out a wide range of adverse near term consequences likely to
emerge in response to the anticipated near term energy with-
drawal from the world economy.
2. Ruppert (2009) refers to energy and economic systems as
Siamese twins. They expand and contract in concert. This is
inexorably the case because new energy is required to expand
the economy and any reduction in the available supply of
energy necessarily will result in a corresponding reduction in
productive capacity and destruction of market demand.
3. The webpage for Association for the Study of Peak Oil & Gas­
Irish Chapter (n.d., ASPO-USA) documents these statements
with the following: Historical proof of Peak Oil is demon-
strated by the work of M. King Hubbert, who, in 1956, cor-
rectly predicted that U.S. oil production would peak between
1965 and 1970. A growing number of industry participants and
analysts believe that we are now at or near the top of the curve
of global oil production (for the US case, see Figure 1). Peak
Oil is not about "running out" of oil, but the curve does illus-
trate the quantity and pace at which humanity has extracted
and used oil. With a rising world population and large develop-
ing countries like China and India experiencing rapid growth,
between 2005 and July of 2008 demand was gradually out-
stripping supply. During the second half of 2008, high oil
prices plus financial turmoil and the economic slump actually
reduced demand for oil, thus prices crashed. But the reprieve
will only be temporary because more oil is being consumed
than found; despite the latest technology, few major oil fields
have been discovered since the mid-1970s. The most valuable
and widely used source of energy on earth is gradually become
harder to find and more expensive, setting the scene for con-
siderable social and economic change worldwide.
4. We note a related concern associated with anticipated world-
wide declines in energy, here. The ability of exporting nations
to continue to supply oil and energy exports will very likely be
affected negatively due to growing domestic demand in source
countries for this declining resource. This scenario implies that
as resources worldwide become increasingly scarce, the quan-
tity of exports will contract at a rate higher than the decline
rate for the world as a whole. For the most energy depen-
dent nations, such as the United States, substantial reliance
on imported fuels presents a critical strategic challenge that
has been the focus of intensive and often secretive efforts to
develop and deploy the means to secure a stable future supply
of energy. Central to these policy developments is an acute
awareness that access to and consumption of critical energy
resources underwrites continuing expansion of the economy.
5. Sampson and Wilson (1995) note the "unproductive mix of
controversy and silence" surrounding discussions of race and
crime as criminologists are loath to openly discuss issues that
might be misconstrued as racist.

ing police administration and related police outcomes and used

pling procedure that insured all urban agencies were included

Consequently, data used in this analysis cannot assess energy
consumption patterns for all U.S. counties but is limited to a
large representative sample.

mental criminal activities recorded by police, many of which
lie below the threshold for inclusion in the robbery category.
For example, larceny, burglary, and auto theft are each instru-
mental crimes but are considered lesser crimes. Indeed, these
are the core categories of property crimes in the Uniform
Crime Report, while robbery is included as one of the four
violent crimes. In addressing robberies, we consider the fact
that these events involve force or the threat of force while tak-
ing possession of property and so it is a serious instrumental
crime posing substantial risk for both victims and offenders,
if caught and prosecuted. The robbery indicator exhibits some
zeros across the sample of counties but this should not imply
that these are free of all instrumental crimes. Indeed, we might
expect to still observe many lesser categories of instrumental
criminal activity even if there are no recorded robberies for the
year. But as our recording instrument does not include these
categories, the data record is censored at zero. Under such
circumstances, an alternative to ordinary least squares (OLS)
may provide a more consistent estimate of effects. Tobit is a
method that seeks to explicitly estimate effects under condi-
tions involving censoring on the outcome indicator. For this
reason, we present the results based on a Tobit model.
8. Community resilience is not something that can be expected to
arise suddenly and successfully. It must be fostered and devel-
oped, and this is something that requires thoughtful efforts,
planning, and resources in its own right. This extends well
beyond a focus on reducing the risk of crime; the implications
for food security, social mobility, and a wide range of neigh-
borhood and community systems for delivery of essential
social services (schools, sewage and water treatment facilities,
power generation, parks, emergency services and social con-
trol, among others) are susceptible to disruption and should
be given full consideration in any contingency planning sur-
rounding future energy security.
