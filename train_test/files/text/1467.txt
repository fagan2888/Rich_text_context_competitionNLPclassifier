OBJECTIVE -- We examined prevalences of previously diagnosed diabetes and undiagnosed
diabetes and high risk for diabetes using recently suggested A1C criteria in the U.S. during
2003­2006. We compared these prevalences to those in earlier surveys and those using glucose
criteria.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- In 2003­2006, the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey included a probability sample of 14,611 individuals aged 12
years. Participants were classified on glycemic status by interview for diagnosed diabetes and by
A1C, fasting, and 2-h glucose challenge values measured in subsamples.
RESULTS -- Using A1C criteria, the crude prevalence of total diabetes in adults aged 20
years was 9.6% (20.4 million), of which 19.0% was undiagnosed (7.8% diagnosed, 1.8% undi-
agnosed using A1C 6.5%). Another 3.5% of adults (7.4 million) were at high risk for diabetes
(A1C 6.0 to 6.5%). Prevalences were disproportionately high in the elderly. Age-/sex-
standardized prevalence was more than two times higher in non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican
Americans versus non-Hispanic whites for diagnosed, undiagnosed, and total diabetes (P 
0.003); standardized prevalence at high risk for diabetes was more than two times higher in
non-Hispanic blacks versus non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans (P  0.00001). Since
1988­1994, diagnosed diabetes generally increased, while the percent of diabetes that was
undiagnosed and the percent at high risk of diabetes generally decreased. Using A1C criteria,
prevalences of undiagnosed diabetes and high risk of diabetes were one-third that and one-tenth
that, respectively, using glucose criteria.
CONCLUSIONS -- Although A1C detects much lower prevalences than glucose criteria,
hyperglycemic conditions remain high in the U.S., and elderly and minority groups are dispro-
portionately affected.

The A1C test has recently been rec-
ommended for diagnosing diabetes,
based on a detailed analysis of its
attributes by an international expert com-
mittee (1). Laboratory-measured A1C is
now as accurate and precise as glucose
assays due to improvements in instru-
mentation and standardization. A1C sam-
ples can be obtained at any time, require
no patient preparation, and are relatively
stable at room temperature after collec-
tion. A1C has substantially less biologic
variability and is unaffected by acute ef-
fects of stress or illness. As a measure of
long-term glycemic exposure, A1C has
been shown to be better and more consis-
tently correlated with retinopathy in the
setting of observational studies and clini-
cal trials in type 1 and type 2 diabetic
patients, which have established widely
accepted A1C treatment goals for diabe-
tes. A cut point of 6.5% for the diagno-
sis of diabetes was recommended by the
committee as optimal for detecting a level
of retinopathy thought to be diabetes spe-
cific and not due to other conditions (e.g.,
hypertension). A limitation of A1C for di-
agnosis is that the committee could not
define a specific intermediate threshold at
which increased risk for diabetes clearly
begins. While there is a continuum of risk
even at values into the normal range, the
committee suggested the range of 6.0 to
6.5% to represent the highest risk for
progression to diabetes and one at which
preventive measures might be imple-
mented, with additional consideration of
prevention efforts at lower levels in the
presence of other risk factors. The com-
mittee hoped that its report would serve
as a stimulus to the scientific community
and professional organizations for con-
sidering the A1C assay for diagnosis of
diabetes.
A change in diagnostic criteria has
important public health implications per-
taining to the magnitude of the popula-
tion with diabetes or at high risk of
diabetes. This report examines the preva-
lence of diagnosed and undiagnosed dia-
betes and high risk of diabetes based on
self-report and A1C criteria in the U.S.
population during 2003­2006. Preva-
lences are compared with those using the
A1C criteria in 1988­1994 and 1999­
2002. Finally, we compare the concor-
dance in prevalence of undiagnosed
diabetes using the new A1C criteria to cri-
teria based on fasting plasma glucose and
2-h plasma glucose from an oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 2003­2006 was conducted
by the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics (2). NHANES is designed to be
representative of the U.S. civilian non-
institutionalized population using a
complex, multistage probability sam-
ple. Participants are interviewed in their

homes and subsequently receive a phys-
ical and laboratory examination in a
mobile examination center. Among eli-
gible subjects in 2003­2006, 79.7%
were interviewed and 76.7% were ex-
amined (2).
In 2003­2006, 14,611 individuals
aged 12 years (77.0% of eligible) com-
pleted the household interview. Individ-
uals were classified as having previously
diagnosed diabetes if they answered affir-
matively to the question of whether, other
than during pregnancy, a doctor or health
care professional had ever told them that
they have diabetes. Of interviewed sub-
jects, 13,970 individuals (95.6%) were
subsequently examined after random as-
signment to either a morning or after-
noon/evening session, during which an
A1C was obtained. Of examined individ-
uals, 13,094 individuals (93.7%) had
valid responses to the diabetes interview
question and a valid A1C value. Pregnant
women (n  610) were included, none of
whom had undiagnosed diabetes based
on A1C.
Beginning in 2005, the OGTT was
performed in the NHANES after a de-
cade hiatus. In 2005­2006, there were
2,050 individuals aged 20 years
without diagnosed diabetes based on
interview who were examined in the
morning and asked to fast overnight.
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values
were obtained from 1,780 (86.8%) after
fasting 8 to 24 h. These individuals
then underwent an OGTT (2), consist-
ing of a 75-g glucose-equivalent oral
glucose challenge (Trutol) and a blood
sample draw 2 h (15 min) later. Ex-
clusion criteria included known preg-
nancy, hemophilia, chemotherapy,
refusal of phlebotomy, and inability/
refusal to drink all of the Trutol. The
2-h glucose value was obtained for
1,508 individuals (91.5% of those eligi-
ble for the OGTT).
Procedures for blood collection and
processing are described elsewhere (2).
A1C was measured using whole blood at a
central laboratory by a high-performance
liquid chromatographic assay and stan-
dardized according to the method of the
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
(3), with a coefficient of variation of 1.0­
1.7% (2). Plasma glucose was measured
using a hexokinase enzymatic method,
with a coefficient of variation of 1.3­2.2%
(2). Because there were changes to the
equipment and laboratory that measured
A1C and glucose in 2005­2006 since
earlier NHANES surveys, values from
2005­2006 were converted via a linear
transformation to make them comparable
to values from NHANES III (1988­1994)
and NHANES 1999­2004 (2).
A1C criteria recommended by the re-
cent international expert committee re-
port (1) were used to classify people
without diagnosed diabetes as to whether
they had undiagnosed diabetes (A1C
6.5%) or were at high risk for diabetes
(A1C 6.0 to 6.5%). American Diabe-
tes Association diagnostic criteria for dia-
betes were also used based on FPG 7.0
mmol/l and/or 2-h glucose 11.1 mmol/l
(4).
Estimates for prevalence of diabetes
and high risk for diabetes are compared
with those from NHANES 1988­1994
and NHANES 1999­2002. These surveys
used similar interview questions and col-
lection and assay methods for blood spec-
imens (2).
Prevalence estimates in Tables 1 and
2 were calculated among examined indi-
viduals with known diabetes status based
on interview and with valid A1C, using
examination sample weights; a similar
percent of individuals with and without
diagnosed diabetes had valid A1C values.
Population counts of diabetes and high
risk for diabetes were obtained by apply-
ing rates to the 2003­2006 U.S. popula-
tion estimates (5). The comparison of
prevalence of diabetes based on A1C to
that based on FPG and 2-h glucose from
an OGTT (Fig. 1) was calculated among
individuals in the OGTT subsample in
2005­2006, using OGTT sample
weights. These weights were calibrated
so that the respective subsamples are
representative of the full U.S. popula-
tion (2).
For comparisons of estimates across
survey years and across population sub-
groups (of age, sex, and race/ethnicity) in
2003­2006, we directly standardized es-
timates to the U.S. 2000 Census popula-
tion by age and/or sex with age categories
of 20 ­39, 40 ­59, and 60 years.
SUDAAN version 10.0.0 (6) was used to
calculate standard errors using the Taylor
series linearization method (7).
For NHANES 2003­2006, we used
one-sample Student's t tests for testing
whether differences between subgroups
in proportions were significantly different
from zero. Two-sample Student's t tests
were used to test differences in propor-
tions between 1988­1994 and 2003­
2006 and 1999­2002 and 2003­2006. A
P value 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Prevalences in 2003­2006
Diagnosed diabetes. The crude preva-
lence of diagnosed diabetes was 7.8% in
subjects aged 20 years, or 16.5 million
people; corresponding crude prevalences
were 6.8% in individuals aged 12 years
and 17.7% in those aged 65 years (Table
1). Both crude and standardized preva-
lences (Table 2) increased significantly with
age, peaking at age 60­74 years (crude
17.6%), and were similar in men and
women.Atage20years,crudeprevalence
was significantly higher in non-Hispanic
blacks (11.2%) than in non-Hispanic
whites (6.9%, P  0.00001) and Mexican
Americans (7.9%, P  0.004). Standard-
ized prevalences at age 20 years were
nearly twice as high in both non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican Americans as in non-
Hispanic whites (both P  0.00001).
Undiagnosed diabetes. The crude prev-
alence of undiagnosed diabetes (A1C
6.5%) was 1.8% in subjects aged 20
years, or 3.9 million people; crude preva-
lences were 1.6% in subjects aged 12
years and 3.5% in those aged 65 years
(Table 1). Both crude and standardized
prevalences (Table 2) increased signifi-
cantly with age and peaked at ages 60­74
and 75 years (3.5­3.6%). Crude and
standardized prevalences did not differ
significantly by sex. Both crude and stan-
dardized prevalences of undiagnosed di-
abetes at age 20 years were about two
times higher in non-Hispanic blacks
(standardized, P  0.0007) and Mexican
Americans (standardized, P  0.0027)
than in non-Hispanic whites.
Total diabetes. The crude prevalence of
total diabetes (diagnosed and undiag-
nosed combined) was 9.6% in subjects
aged 20 years, or 20.4 million; preva-
lences were 8.4% in individuals aged 12
years and 21.1% in those aged 65 years
(Table 1). Both crude and standardized
prevalences (Table 2) increased signifi-
cantly with age, peaking at age 60­74
years (21.1%), and were similar in men
and women. There were significant differ-
ences by race/ethnicity in crude prevalence
atallages,withprevalencealwayshighestin
non-Hispanic blacks and lowest in non-
Hispanic whites. Standardized prevalence
of total diabetes at age 20 years was about
twice as high in non-Hispanic blacks and
Mexican Americans than in non-Hispanic
whites (both P  0.00001).
Percent of total diabetes that is undiag-
nosed. Among individuals with diabe-
tes, 19.0% was undiagnosed at both age

20 and 12 years and 16.3% was un-
diagnosed at age 65 years (Table 1).
Both the crude percent of diabetes that
was undiagnosed and the standardized
percent (Table 2) did not differ signifi-
cantly by age or sex. At age 20 years, the
standardized proportion of diabetes that
was undiagnosed was about twice as high
in Mexican Americans (34.6%) than in
non-Hispanic whites (17.1%, P  0.03)
and non-Hispanic blacks (15.7%, P 
0.003).
High risk for diabetes. The crude prev-
alence of being at high risk for diabetes
was 3.5% among subjects aged 20
years, comprising 7.4 million individuals;
corresponding crude prevalences were
3.1% in those aged 12 years and 8.1%
in those aged 65 years (Table 1). Both
crude and standardized prevalences (Ta-
ble 2) of individuals at high risk for dia-
betes increased significantly with age but
did not differ by sex. The proportion at
high risk for diabetes was two to three
times higher in non-Hispanic blacks than
in non-Hispanic whites and Mexican
Americans (standardized, both P 
0.00001).
Trends in standardized prevalences
over time. Diagnosed diabetes increased
significantly from 5.3% in 1988­1993 to
7.6% in 2003­2006 in subjects aged 20
years (P  0.00001, 1988 ­1994 vs.
2003­2006) (Table 2). Diagnosed diabe-
tes increased significantly in all age-
groups except in those aged 75 years
and increased significantly in both sexes
and in all race/ethnic groups. There were
nonsignificant decreases in undiagnosed
diabetes in almost all groups except non-
Hispanic blacks, in whom there was a sig-
nificant decrease (5.0% in 1988­1994 to
2.7% in 2003­2006, P  0.00001). Total
diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed
combined) increased significantly from
7.4% in 1988­1994 to 9.3% in 2003­
2006 in subjects aged 20 years (P 
0.0003, 1988­1994 vs. 2003­2006), as
well as in all age-groups (except those
aged 75 years) and in both sexes.
Among racial/ethnic groups, total diabe-
tes increased significantly only among
Mexican Americans. Among subjects with
diabetes, the percent with undiagnosed
diabetes decreased significantly in the
combined age-group of 65 years
(25.6% in 1988­1994 to 16.4% in 2003­

2006, P  0.003), age-specific groups of
40­59 and 60­74 years, women, non-
Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans.
The percent at high risk for diabetes de-
creased significantly for all ages (e.g., at
age 20 years, 4.9% in 1988­1994 to
3.4% in 2003­2006, P  0.00001), ex-
cept in subjects aged 60­74 years (P 
0.06), and decreased significantly in all
sex and racial/ethnic groups.
Comparison of prevalences of undiag-
nosed diabetes based on A1C, FPG,
and 2-h plasma glucose. Fig. 1 classifies
individuals on glycemic status using data
from the OGTT subsample who, in addi-
tion to the 2-h plasma glucose, had mea-
surement of A1C and FPG. A total of 5.4%
of the population aged 20 years was
classified as having undiagnosed diabetes
based on at least one of these criteria; the
remaining population was classified as
having diagnosed diabetes (7.8%) or be-
ing nondiabetic (86.9%). All three criteria
simultaneously classified 1.2% of the total
population (23% of undiagnosed) as hav-
ing undiagnosed diabetes. The A1C crite-
rion diagnosed the smallest percent
(1.6%) of the total population, or 30% of
the undiagnosed diabetic group. In con-
trast, the 2-h plasma glucose diagnosed
4.9% of the total population, or 90% of
those with undiagnosed diabetes; a sub-
stantial percent (2.5% of the total popu-
lation or 47% of undiagnosed diabetes)
was detected only by the 2-h plasma glu-
cose but not by the A1C or FPG. In addi-
tion, a substantial proportion (1.0% of the
total population or 19.0% of undiagnosed
diabetes) was diagnosed by both FPG and
2-h plasma glucose but not by A1C. Most
people who were diagnosed by A1C were
also diagnosed by FPG (1.2%) or 2-h
plasma glucose (1.3%).
CONCLUSIONS -- Applying A1C
criteria to define undiagnosed diabetes
(6.5%) and high risk of diabetes (6.0 to
6.5%), we find that in the U.S. popula-
tion aged 20 years during 2003­2006,
the crude prevalence of total diabetes is
9.6% or 20.4 million, of which 19.0% is
undiagnosed (7.8% previously diagnosed
and 1.8% undiagnosed). An additional
3.5% of adults, or 7.4 million, are at high
risk of diabetes, yielding 13.0% of the
U.S. population aged 20 years, or 27.8
million, who have a hyperglycemic con-
dition. Prevalence of these conditions is
strongly influenced by increasing age.
While we find no differences by sex, we
continue to find non-Hispanic blacks and
Mexican Americans disproportionately

affected. Although the prevalence of pre-
viously diagnosed diabetes has significantly
increased over time in most population
groups, the proportion of diabetes that is
undiagnosed using A1C criteria has signifi-
cantly decreased over time in many groups,
and the proportion at high risk of diabetes
has significantly decreased in almost all
groups.
A1C criteria result in substantially
lower prevalences of undiagnosed and to-
tal diabetes, and being at high risk for di-
abetes, than prevalences estimated from
fasting plasma glucose or 2-h glucose.
The prevalences reported here can be
compared with our recently reported
prevalences of undiagnosed diabetes, im-
paired fasting glucose (IFG), and im-
paired glucose tolerance (IGT) in 2005­
2006 using glucose criteria (8) (online
appendix Table A1, available at http://
care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/
dc09-1524/DC1). Standardized prevalence
of undiagnosed diabetes using A1C crite-
ria (1.8%) in this report was one-third
that using either FPG or 2-h glucose cri-
teria (5.0% combined, 2.4% by FPG
alone, and 4.8% by 2-h alone), resulting
in a prevalence of total diabetes using A1C
criteria one-quarter less than that of total
diabetes using either glucose criteria (9.3
vs. 12.6%). The proportion of total diabe-
tes that is undiagnosed using A1C criteria
(21.5%) was 40% less than that using glu-
cose criteria (34.2%). The prevalence of
being at high risk of diabetes using A1C
criteria (3.4%) was dramatically reduced
to about one-tenth the prevalence using
FPG/2-h glucose criteria (29.0% com-
bined, 25.2% IFG, and 13.6% IGT).
The substantially lower prevalence of
diabetes detected by A1C criteria was il-
lustrated (Fig. 1) by analyzing the concor-
dance of A1C, FPG, and 2-h glucose
criteria in 2005­2006. A1C detected only
30% of undiagnosed diabetes defined by
any of the three criteria; by contrast, 2-h
plasma glucose detected 90% of undiag-
nosed diabetes. A relatively large propor-
tion (19%) of undiagnosed diabetes was
detected by both FPG and 2-h glucose but
not by A1C.
The fact that prevalence of being at
high risk for diabetes/pre-diabetes de-
tected by A1C is about one-tenth the
prevalence of IFG or IGT is striking. The
relatively small sample size during 2005­
2006 prohibited our assessing discor-
dance of prevalence at high risk for
diabetes using A1C versus prevalence of
pre-diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and
normal glucose status using glucose crite-
ria, because of the large number of over-
lapping categories involved.
Certain relationships by age and race/
ethnicity also differed between results
based on A1C criteria (herein) and glu-
cose criteria (8) (online appendix Table
A1). By age, undiagnosed diabetes in-
creased less dramatically using A1C crite-
ria than it did using glucose criteria,
whereas prevalence of being at high risk
for diabetes increased relatively more dra-
matically using A1C criteria. Factors un-
related to glycemic control may explain
some of the increase by age in prevalence
of high risk for diabetes. A1C increased
with age in nondiabetic participants of the
Framingham Offspring Study and the
NHANES 2001­2004 and in the Fra-
mingham Offspring Study participants
with normal glucose tolerance, while ad-
justing for fasting and 2-h glucose levels
and other factors (9). Racial/ethnic differ-
ences in the prevalence of undiagnosed
diabetes and high risk of diabetes were
disproportionately greater using A1C cri-
teria compared with glucose criteria,
which may also be explained in part by
factors unrelated to glucose control.
Blacks and Hispanics with IGT in the Di-
abetes Prevention Program had higher
A1C levels than whites, after adjusting for
glucose levels and other factors such as
age, sex, education, blood pressure, BMI,
hematocrit, and insulin resistance (10).

Prevalence of diabetes using A1C

This may suggest that hemoglobin glyca-
tion or red cell survival differs among ra-
cial/ethnic groups.
A limitation of our analyses is that de-
termination of undiagnosed diabetes and
high risk for diabetes/pre-diabetes is
based on a single measurement of A1C,
FPG, and 2-h glucose from subjects who
self-reported that they fasted appropri-
ately (for FPG and 2-h glucose), whereas
retesting is suggested for diagnosis in a
clinical setting. Consequently, some prev-
alence estimates may be overstated (11).
In addition, although there should be lim-
ited interference from hemoglobin traits
due to the A1C assay methods used in
NHANES (2,12), A1C levels may be spu-
rious with conditions that change red cell
turnover (e.g., anemia) (12,13) regardless
of the assay method used.
Some individuals with self-reported
diabetes may not have had diabetes de-
tected if A1C criteria had been used.
When we excluded individuals self-
reporting diabetes who reported not us-
ing glycemic medications and who had
A1C 6.5%, prevalence of diagnosed di-
abetes decreased 0.9%. This was a larger
decrease than when we performed the
same analysis excluding those with FPG
126 mg/dl (0.3% decrease) or those
with 2-h glucose 200 mg/dl (0.2% de-
crease). Consequently, our estimates of
diagnosed and total diabetes may be over-
stated, and the percent of total diabetes
that is undiagnosed may be understated.
The international expert committee
emphasized that glucose and A1C levels
reflect different aspects of glucose metab-
olism. The purpose of their report was not
to establish identical prevalences in defin-
ing new criteria for diabetes and high risk
for diabetes but rather to identify individ-
uals at risk for diabetes complications and
diabetes so that preventive treatment
could follow. It will be important to de-
termine longitudinally whether compli-
cation rates differ between individuals
detected by glucose criteria or by A1C
criteria.
If A1C criteria are adopted by the
American Diabetes Association, the iden-
tification of a smaller high-risk group may
be considered advantageous because of
the limited availability of resources. How-
ever, a substantial proportion of individ-
uals similar to those in the Diabetes
Prevention Program (14) would be missed
and not receive preventive intervention to
reduce risk. The nearly 1% of the popu-
lation previously diagnosed with diabetes
who no longer have diabetes by A1C cri-
teria may need careful explanation of the
alternative diagnostic criteria, the arbi-
trary cut point for diagnosis along a con-
tinuum of risk, and the progressive nature
of dysglycemia so that diabetic/pre-
diabetic conditions are not thought to be
less real or serious. While the change in
diagnosis in some from diabetes to high
risk of diabetes using A1C criteria might
not alter recommended glycemic control
and lifestyle management, recommended
blood pressure and lipid targets would
differ (15), requiring careful consider-
ation of individualized therapeutic goals.
A change to A1C criteria would also
impact national surveillance of these con-
ditions. Estimated self-reported diabetes
based on surveys and the tracking of tem-
poral trends would likely be difficult to
interpret for some time before these crite-
ria are fully assimilated in medical prac-
tice. An interim period of measurement
both by A1C and glucose may be neces-
sary for international and domestic his-
torical comparisons.
The potential impact of these dramat-
ically lower estimates of diabetes, and
particularly of high risk for diabetes, on
public perception of the magnitude and
seriousness of diabetes is concerning. The
fact remains that diabetes and its sequelae

calculated among individuals in the OGTT subsample in 2005­2006 (n  2,017); consequently some estimates may differ slightly from those in Table
1. The thresholds of diagnostic criteria for diabetes were A1C 6.5%, FPG 7.0 mmol/1, and 2-h glucose 11.1 mmol/1. Point estimates (%) and
95% CIs for the categories are: A1C alone  0.3 (0.0­0.7); FPG alone  0.2 (0.0­0.5); 2-h glucose alone  2.5 (1.9­3.2); A1C and FPG not 2-h
glucose  0.0; A1C and 2-h glucose not FPG  0.1 (0.0­0.3); FPG and 2-h glucose not A1C  1.0 (0.3­1.8); A1C, FPG, and 2-h glucose  1.2
(0.5­2.0); total A1C  1.6 (0.7­2.5); total FPG  2.5 (1.2­3.8); total 2-h glucose  4.9 (3.4­6.4); diagnosed diabetes  7.8 (6.7­8.8);

health problems that disproportionately
affect the elderly, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans. A continued
commitment to the primary and second-
ary prevention of diabetes by the public
and private sectors is needed to limit the
severe toll that diabetes exacts in the U.S.
