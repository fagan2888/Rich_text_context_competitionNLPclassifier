Health Insurance
Coverage After Welfare
Almost half of women and close to one-third of children are
uninsured one year after leaving welfare.
by Bowen Garrett and John Holahan
ABSTRACT: This DataWatch examines the health insurance coverage of former
welfare recipients who left welfare between January 1995 and mid-1997, using
data from the 1997 National Survey of America's Families. Although the major-
ity of women who left welfare were working, only 33 percent of these women
obtained health coverage through their jobs. Rates of uninsurance increase
with the number of months since leaving welfare and with declines in Medicaid
coverage. A year or more after leaving welfare, 49 percent of women and 30
percent of children were uninsured.
Major changes took place in the nation's welfare sys-
tem in the latter part of the 1990s. National welfare reform
legislation, the Personal Responsibility and Work Oppor-
tunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, replaced Aid to
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) with a new federal
block grant program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Fami-
lies (TANF). Prior to PRWORA, several states had already imple-
mented major changes to their welfare systems under federal waiv-
ers. One intent of these welfare reform efforts was for persons who
leave cash assistance to remain on Medicaid. The current downward
trend in both welfare and Medicaid caseloads, however, has in-
creased concern that many of those leaving welfare are being unin-
tentionally and inappropriately dropped from Medicaid.1
Using nationally representative data from the 1997 National Sur-
vey of America's Families (NSAF), this DataWatch examines the
extent to which former welfare recipients maintain health insurance
coverage. The NSAF was conducted before states implemented
PRWORA but during a period in which caseloads were already
falling rapidly, in part because of the strong economy and earlier
welfare changes under state waivers. We describe here the health
insurance coverage of women and children who left welfare in the
prior two years--between January 1995 and mid-1997--and then
examine differences in employment status and income by the

number of months since leaving welfare.
n Background. Families who leave welfare can retain their
Medicaid coverage in several ways. Since the Family Support Act of
1988, states have been required to provide Transitional Medicaid
Assistance (TMA) to families who left AFDC because of increased
earnings. Under TMA former welfare recipients can retain Medicaid
for six months regardless of income, and for another six months if
their income does not exceed 185 percent of poverty after disregards
for child care expenses.2
Pregnant women and children may be eligible for Medicaid
through federal and state poverty-related provisions.3 In some states
both adults and children who are categorically eligible can qualify
for Medicaid through medically needy programs. Children and
adults with qualifying disabilities may obtain Medicaid eligibility
through Supplemental Security Income (SSI). With the delinking of
Medicaid and cash assistance under PRWORA, states are required
to provide Medicaid coverage to all families who meet the income
and family structure guidelines that applied to the state's AFDC
program 16 July 1996. States also now have great flexibility in ex-
panding coverage beyond these thresholds.4
Because of these provisions, most former welfare recipients
should be eligible for Medicaid immediately after leaving welfare.
Most families still have low incomes after leaving welfare, but the
few with relatively high incomes may be ineligible.5 Children are
more likely than adults are to retain eligibility after leaving welfare.
While both children and adults can become eligible as medically
needy, children remain eligible through the poverty-related provi-
sions, and the primary remaining path for adults is limited to TMA.6
Data And Methods
This study uses data from the 1997 NSAF, a household survey that
provides information on 100,000 children and adults representing
the noninstitutionalized civilian population under age sixty-five.
The NSAF sample was designed to provide both state-repre-
sentative estimates in thirteen states (Alabama, California, Colo-
rado, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,
New Jersey, New York, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin) and
reliable national-level estimates. The survey oversampled families
with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level.7 The
overall household response rate was approximately 70 percent.8
In families with children, the respondent was the adult who
knew the most about the children's education and health care. The
respondent was asked whether she ever received AFDC in her name,
or in the name of any of her children, since January 1995. (Respon-

dents were female in more than 90 percent of these cases.) The
survey also asked whether the family had ever stopped receiving
AFDC payments for more than one month since January 1995.9
For this study, "former welfare recipients" (or "welfare leavers")
refers to women and children in families who stopped receiving
AFDC at any point between January 1995 and the date of the inter-
view in 1997 and were not currently receiving AFDC.10 Families who
left welfare since January 1995 but were receiving AFDC at the time
of the interview are not included in our sample of welfare leavers.
Other families may have left welfare, returned, and left again. The
survey does not allow us to identify such families, but they are
included in our sample. The survey asks the month and year the
family last received an AFDC check, which is used to compute the
number of months since the family last received AFDC. Some of the
women welfare leavers received welfare not for themselves but on
behalf of their children. For brevity, however, we henceforth refer to
women in families that left welfare simply as "women who left
welfare."
The percentages we report below were weighted to produce esti-
mates representative of the national population. The weights reflect
the design features of the sample, including the oversampling of
low-income households in the study states, and contain adjust-
ments for nonresponse and undercoverage. The reported numbers
reflect the actual, rather than weighted, number of survey responses.
Variance estimates were computed using a method that adjusts for
the survey's complex sample design.11
Results
n Insurance coverage of former welfare recipients. We identi-
fied 1,004 women who left welfare at some point between January
1995 and the time of the interview in 1997 as described above. Only
36 percent of these women reported receiving Medicaid; 23 percent
obtained private/employer coverage; and a few (4 percent) were
covered under other forms of public health insurance (such as Medi-
care and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed
Services, or CHAMPUS) (Exhibit 1). The net result is that 41 per-
cent of women who had previously received welfare were uninsured
in 1997. These insurance groups are not mutually exclusive, and,
accordingly, the percentages do not add to 100 percent. Some
women, for example, had both Medicaid and private coverage.12
We identified 1,662 children who formerly received welfare. Chil-
dren were more likely than women were to have Medicaid coverage
after leaving welfare. Fifty percent of former child welfare recipients
were enrolled in Medicaid; 27 percent had private coverage; and 2

percent had other public coverage. The net result was that 25 per-
cent of children who previously received welfare were uninsured.
n Insurance coverage by the number of months since leav-
ing welfare. Because eligibility for transitional Medicaid assistance
elapses after twelve months, we should expect the Medicaid cover-
age of former welfare recipients to fall with time after leaving the
welfare rolls. For women who left welfare less than six months ago,
we found that 56 percent kept Medicaid coverage (Exhibit 2).13 This
percentage fell over time to 22 percent for those who left welfare
more than a year ago. Although the number receiving private/em-
ployer coverage rose over time, only 28 percent of women who left
welfare had private coverage one year after leaving. Because the
increase in employer coverage does not offset the declining rate of
Medicaid participation, the percentage who are uninsured rises
with the time since leaving welfare. Forty-nine percent of women
were uninsured one year after leaving welfare.
The pattern for children is similar, but more children (70 percent)

continued in Medicaid for the first six months after leaving welfare,
consistent with the broader poverty-related provisions for child
Medicaid eligibility (Exhibit 2). After one year 47 percent of chil-
dren remained enrolled. Private/employer coverage increased from
13 percent in the first six months to 29 percent after one year. The
percentage of children who were uninsured after leaving welfare
increased with time, from 19 percent in the first six months to 29
percent after one year; however, this difference is not significant.
The health insurance coverage pattern of those who were missing
the month's information appears most similar to the pattern of those
who left welfare more than a year ago.14
n Insurance coverage and employment. For the remainder of
this DataWatch we use the full sample of former welfare recipients,
regardless of the number of months since they left welfare. For
former welfare recipients, virtually all private coverage comes
through a woman's own employment or her spouse's employment.15
Fifty-six percent of women reported having a job, but of these only
33 percent had private/employer coverage (Exhibit 3).16 Women
who were not working were only slightly more likely than those
who were working to have Medicaid coverage.17 Those who were
not working also were less likely to have private/employer coverage,
and most of the 11 percent who did were covered as a dependent
through their spouse's employment.
For children, 47 percent were covered by Medicaid when their
caretaker was working. When their caretaker was not working, the
percentage covered by Medicaid was slightly higher. Children were
less likely to be covered by private/employer insurance when the
caretaker was not working than when the caretaker was working.

n Insurance coverage and income. More than half of women
who leave welfare have incomes that put them below the federal
poverty line (Exhibit 4). Only 12 percent have incomes in excess of
200 percent of poverty. Medicaid coverage for these women falls
significantly as income as a percentage of poverty rises, but Medic-
aid covers only 44 percent of those with incomes below the federal
poverty line. Private health insurance coverage increases with in-
come, but even for those with incomes above 200 percent of poverty,
only 49 percent obtain private coverage. The net result is that rates
of uninsurance among women who formerly received welfare are
around 43­44 percent for those with incomes below 200 percent of
poverty. Once incomes exceed 200 percent of poverty, the gains in
private insurance begin to offset losses as a result of falling Medicaid
coverage, and the rate of uninsurance among these women falls to
around 20 percent.
Patterns of child health insurance coverage by income are similar.
For the 66 percent of former child welfare recipients in families with
incomes less than the federal poverty level, 59 percent have Medic-
aid, even though most of these children should have been eligible
under federal poverty-related provisions (Exhibit 4).18 Medicaid
coverage falls significantly to 36 percent for children with incomes
over 200 percent of poverty. Private insurance coverage rises signifi-
cantly from 22 percent for those under the poverty line to 45 percent
for those over 200 percent of poverty. The resulting pattern on child
rates of uninsurance is that the children most likely to be uninsured
are those with incomes between 100 percent and 200 percent of
poverty. In this group 32 percent of children are uninsured, although
the difference between these children and those below the poverty
line (24 percent) is not statistically significant.19

Discussion
Despite there being several ways of maintaining Medicaid eligibility
after leaving welfare, particularly in the first year, a large percentage
of women and children do not maintain their Medicaid coverage and
become uninsured. For the entire sample of those leaving welfare,
we found that 41 percent of women and 25 percent of children were
uninsured. One year or more after leaving welfare, 49 percent of
women and 29 percent of children were uninsured.
Even women who follow the "welfare-to-work" objective of wel-
fare reform and gain employment have roughly even odds of being on
Medicaid, privately insured, or uninsured after leaving welfare. Only
about a third of the 56 percent of women who hold jobs after leaving
welfare obtain private coverage through their jobs; this can happen
either because the employer does not offer health insurance or be-
cause the worker decides that the cost is too high. Children are more
likely to be covered after leaving welfare because federal and state
Medicaid eligibility rules are more inclusive of children than they
are of adults. Considering current efforts to target health coverage to
needy children, it is puzzling that so many persons who are already
known to the welfare system and are likely to remain in poverty do
not receive Medicaid and go uninsured.
Several of the reasons commonly cited for low take-up rates in
Medicaid overall probably operate here as well.20 First, stigma at-
tached to Medicaid could deter some former welfare recipients from
reapplying for coverage. Second, PRWORA has greatly increased
the complexity of Medicaid eligibility rules, and these rules may be
difficult for former welfare recipients to comprehend. Third, state
administrative requirements, such as completing complicated appli-
cation forms and undergoing in-person interviews at a welfare of-
fice, may place difficult burdens on newly working parents. Fourth,
the complexity of the new Medicaid eligibility rules may be difficult
to understand even for welfare caseworkers, who have the major
responsibility for educating poor families about Medicaid.
Beyond 1997 it is not clear whether the problem of unin-
surance after leaving welfare will get better or worse. The
system has become increasingly difficult for both caseworkers
and families to navigate, and many welfare leavers may be deterred
from applying for Medicaid simply because of these administrative
"Stigma attached to Medicaid could deter some former welfare
recipients from reapplying for coverage."

complexities.21 However, given the wide latitude states have in
keeping welfare recipients on Medicaid, the situation may improve
if states respond to the publicity surrounding the issue by stream-
lining administrative procedures and improving outreach, and if
caseworkers and recipients themselves learn that leaving welfare
does not imply losing Medicaid. Moreover, PRWORA gave states
new flexibility in expanding coverage to children and their parents,
and some states are beginning to take advantage of these provisions.

2. Families also are eligible for TMA if they lose welfare because their child-sup-
port payments increased. The caretaker is required to report the family's
income quarterly and must continue working to remain eligible. PRWORA
extended states' obligation to provide TMA until 2001. See J. Kaplan, "Transi-
tional Medicaid Assistance" (Washington: Welfare Information Network,
1997).
3. Federal law requires states to provide Medicaid to children under age six with
family incomes below 133 percent of the poverty line, as well as to older
children born after 30 September 1983 with family incomes below 100 percent
of poverty. In 1997 children between the ages of six and about thirteen with
family incomes below the poverty level were eligible for Medicaid. Most states
have expanded coverage beyond these minimum requirements.
4. States have the option of lowering the income limits on eligibility to the level
that applied 1 May 1988. States also are able to adjust the way countable
income is computed for the purposesof determining Medicaid eligibility using
the AFDC-based rules. See C. Mann, "An Analysis of the AFDC-Related
Medicaid Provisions in the New Welfare Law" (Washington: Center on
Budget and Policy Priorities, 19 September 1999). By increasing the amount
and types of income that are disregarded, states can expand their Medicaid
programs. See J. Guyer and C. Mann, "Taking the Next Step: States Can Now
Take Advantage of Federal Medicaid Matching Funds to Expand Health Care
Coverage to Low-Income Working Parents" (Washington: Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities, 1998).

9. This part of the survey does not probe for state-specific AFDC program names
aside from AFDC, or "ADC." The income section of the survey, however, does
probe using state-specific AFDC program names in collecting information on
the receipt of AFDC payments in the prior year. Because this method captures
only fourteen additional families, the effect of not using this probe in the latter
part of the survey should be negligible.
10. We exclude men who formerly received welfare from our analysis because
there were too few of them to examine separately and because men and
women differ, on average, across all of the key variables in this study.
11. Variance estimates are computed using the method of balanced repeated rep-
lication (BRR). A description of the BRR method and its application to the
NSAF is given in I. Flores-Cervantes, J.M. Brick, and R. DiGaetano, 1997 NSAF
Variance Estimation, NSAF Methodology Report no. 4 (Washington: Urban
Institute and Child Trends, 1999).
12. For women who formerly received welfare, 2.5 percent had both Medicaid and
private coverage and 1.7 percent had both Medicaid and other public coverage.
For children who formerly received welfare, 4.3 percent had both Medicaid
and private coverage and 0.5 percent had both Medicaid and other public
coverage.
13. Even when we limit the sample to women who were working, who should
thereby meet the requirements for TMA, only 63 percent who left welfare less
than six months ago were on Medicaid.
14. See R. Moffitt and E. Slade, "Health Care Coverage for Children On and Off
Welfare," Future of Children (Spring 1997): 87­98, for a national study of the
health insurance coverage of women and children who left welfare between
1989 and 1992 using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. To
better compare our results with those reported by Moffitt and Slade, we
pooled the first six months and the second six months of the first year from
Exhibit 2 to generate an estimate for the entire first year after leaving welfare.
Our figures for being uninsured are the most comparable because they are
invariant as to whether or not a hierarchy was imposed (we did not impose a
hierarchy, but the earlier study did). Despite several differences in the data
sources, the results of the two studies are fairly similar. Our results for unin-
surance among welfare leavers are somewhat higher than those reported in the
earlier study: 36 percent versus 23 percent for women, and 24 percent versus
17 percent for children. This comparison suggests that if there was a change,
the problem of uninsurance among former welfare recipients has worsened
since the early 1990s.
15. We examined the sources of private coverage for this sample and found that
only 7 percent had private coverage that was not sponsored through employ-

16. Loprest, How Families That Left Welfare Are Doing, reports that 61 percent of
welfare leavers were working. We find that women were less likely than men
were to be employed after leaving welfare; thus our figure, which is restricted
to women, is lower. We obtain identical estimates when wedo include men in
our sample.
17. Of the women who formerly received welfare and were not working, 65 per-
cent had family incomes below the federal poverty level. Of those who were
working, 53 percent had family incomes below the federal poverty level.
18. Children who were older than thirteen in 1997 were not all eligible for Medic-
aid because of the ongoing phase-in for children age six and older with in-
comes less than 100 percent of poverty. When we limit this analysis to chil-
dren who are thirteen years old and under, all of whom are Medicaid eligible,
only 63 percent had Medicaid.
19. These patterns do not mimic health insurance coverage for low-income per-
sons overall. Comparing the health insurance coverage of former welfare re-
cipients with incomes below 200 percent of poverty to published NSAF re-
sults for all nonelderly adults and children below 200 percent of poverty, we
find that former welfare recipients are more likely be on Medicaid, less likely
to have private insurance, and more likely to be uninsured. See N. Brennan, J.
Holahan, and G. Kenney, "Snapshots of America's Families: Health Insurance
Coverage of Children" (Washington: Urban Institute, 1999); and S. Zucker-
