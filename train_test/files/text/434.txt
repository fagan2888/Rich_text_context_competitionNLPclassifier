It is well known that humans tend to associate with other humans
who have similar characteristics, but it is unclear whether this
tendency has consequences for the distribution of genotypes in
a population. Although geneticists have shown that populations
tend to stratify genetically, this process results from geographic
sorting or assortative mating, and it is unknown whether geno-
types may be correlated as a consequence of nonreproductive
associations or other processes. Here, we study six available
genotypes from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health to test for genetic similarity between friends. Maps of the
friendship networks show clustering of genotypes and, after we
apply strict controls for population stratification, the results show
that one genotype is positively correlated (homophily) and one
genotype is negatively correlated (heterophily). A replication
study in an independent sample from the Framingham Heart
Study verifies that DRD2 exhibits significant homophily and that
CYP2A6 exhibits significant heterophily. These unique results
show that homophily and heterophily obtain on a genetic (indeed,
an allelic) level, which has implications for the study of population
genetics and social behavior. In particular, the results suggest that
association tests should include friends' genes and that theories
of evolution should take into account the fact that humans might,
in some sense, be metagenomic with respect to the humans
around them.
social networks | gene­environment interaction | indirect genetic effects
Humans are unusual as a species in that virtually all individ-
uals form stable, nonreproductive unions to one or more
friends. Although people apparently choose their friends freely,
genes are known to play a role in the formation (1), attributes
(2­4), and network structures (5) of these unions. It remains
unclear, however, whether variation in specific genes might be
relevant to the process of friend selection or, distinctly, whether
the process of choosing friends might result in correlated geno-
types between friends. Both processes would have implications
for our understanding of population genetics and gene­envi-
ronment interactions.
Here, we examine whether or not phenotypic similarity be-
tween individuals connected in a social network is reflected in
their genotypes. Associations between the genotypes of con-
nected individuals are known to result from genetic correlations
between mates or as a result of groupings established on the
basis of kinship (e.g., matrilineal tribal groupings). Indeed, kin
recognition has been shown in a variety of organisms, including
plants (6), ants (7), and vertebrates (8), and is important for
stabilizing cooperation and promoting inclusive fitness benefits
in some species (9).
However, kinship may not be the only basis on which natural
selection might possibly operate at the group level. For example,
if genetic differences between social networks (or, conversely,
genetic similarity within networks) were found at significant
levels among humans, it would enhance the opportunity for
natural selection to operate at the level of social groups estab-
lished on a basis other than kinship. Such associations have long
been postulated in the theoretical evolutionary genetics litera-
ture (10­13), but there is little extant evidence to support
these theories.
Such a finding would also have relevance in the growing area
of indirect genetic effects, wherein the phenotypic traits of a fo-
cal individual are influenced by genes in the genomes of its
neighbors. This type of effect has recently been shown in a large
SNP study in laying hens where it was found that an individual's
feather condition is very strongly influenced by the genotypes of
its neighbors (14). In fact, the number of such genes was an order
of magnitude larger than the number of genes with a direct effect
in the focal individual's own genome, and the average phenotypic
effects of the "social" genes were more than two times greater
than the genes with direct effect. Interestingly, some of the genes
with indirect or associative effects in hens involve the serotonin
pathway, which has also been shown to influence social behavior
in humans (15, 16). Similar phenomena related to "social" fitness
have also recently been observed in bacteria (17).
In humans, one of the most replicated findings in the social
sciences is that people tend to associate with other people that
they resemble, a process known as "homophily" ("birds of
a feather flock together") (18­20). Although phenotypic re-
semblance between friends might partly reflect the operation of
social influence (21, 22), genotypes are not materially susceptible
to change. Therefore, genotypic resemblance could result only
from a process of selection. Such genotypic selection might in
turn take several forms.
First, correlation in genes may be a trivial by-product of
"population stratification," resulting from the tendency for hu-
man groups with low mobility to reproduce with geographically
proximate mates. Over time, the processes of genetic drift and
local adaptation would cause groups that are geographically
distant to develop distinct frequencies of genotypes (23). If
people also tend to make friends with geographically proximate
individuals, then their genotypes would appear to be more cor-
related within geographically separate groups than between
them. Therefore, any attempt to discern whether some other
selection process is involved in the correlation of genotypes must
use very strict controls for population stratification.
Second, people may actively choose friends of a similar geno-
type. Although it is unlikely that people would observe the actual
genotypes of others around them, they could observe their phe-
notypes, and these may be influenced by specific genotypes. For
example, a person of normal weight may choose to associate only
with others of normal weight, and this would cause people lacking
the risk allele of the FTO gene [which has been associated with
obesity (24)] to tend to befriend others with the same genotype.
Similarly, people might choose to terminate relationships with
people whose weight status differs from their own (25).
Third, people may actively choose environments they find
convivial, environments where they are consequently likely to

encounter people with similar phenotypes that are influenced by
specific genotypes. If people tend to choose friends from within
these environments (even at random), it would tend to generate
correlated genotypes. For example, individuals interested in, and
capable of, long-distance running may be drawn to clubs or loca-
tions where they have the opportunity to make similar friends.
Fourth, people may be chosen by others or otherwise selected
into environments where they come into contact with similar
people. For example, the admission process at a university or the
hiring process in a workplace may select for people with specific
phenotypes (e.g., cognitive skills) that are influenced by specific
genotypes. Similarly, these institutions may get rid of individuals
that do not exhibit certain phenotypes after they are admitted, and
these phenotypes might also be influenced by genotypic variation.
In contrast to homophily, people might also exhibit "hetero-
phily," that is, they might actively choose to associate with people
who are different with respect to some traits ("opposites at-
tract"). It is noteworthy that if there is any substantial negative
correlation between friends' phenotypes or genotypes, this would
be unlikely to result from population stratification or from
people choosing, or being drawn to, the same environment (as in
the case of homophily noted above). Instead, there are two other
processes that might be at work. First, people may actively
choose to befriend people of a different type. The classic ex-
ample of this kind of negative correlation at the genetic level
occurs during mate choice; human beings have a slight prefer-
ence for mates with different HLA types, a process perhaps
mediated by a chemical signaling mechanism (26). Second, cer-
tain environments may require specialization. For example, some
workplaces may select people with different skills to work to-
gether, and if these traits are related to genotypes, then people
may tend to be frequently exposed to dissimilar people with
whom they may have a higher probability of becoming friends.
Results
As noted, genotypes tend to be correlated between people who
live physically close to one another because of population
stratification. However, no work has yet established that, net of
such stratification, there are any genes that are correlated (either
positively or negatively) between individuals in nonreproductive,
friendship unions. To study whether such correlation exists, we
analyzed two independent samples with information about
respondents' genes and about respondents' friendship ties and
social networks: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health) and the Framingham Heart Study Social
Network (FHS-Net). Add Health allowed respondents to name
up to 10 friends at each of three waves over 6 y (27), and the
FHS-Net captured up to two close friends at each of seven waves
over 32 y (28).
In Add Health, subjects were genotyped for one marker each
in the DRD2, DRD4, CYP2A6, MAOA, SLC6A3, and SLC6A4
genes (Materials and Methods). Figs. 1 and 2 show how genotypes
for two of these genes are distributed in the largest connected
component of the friendship network. Notably, significant clus-
ters of similar genotypes for DRD2 suggest the possibility of
homophily, but the substantial absence of any connection be-
tween individuals with minor alleles of CYP2A6 suggests possible
heterophily. In SI Appendix, Fig. S1, we show the results of
simple Monte Carlo tests that suggest these clusters are unlikely
to be the result of chance.
To evaluate statistically whether or not genotypes are corre-
lated between friends, we regressed friend's genotype on sub-
ject's genotype (including controls for the age, sex, and race of
both subject and friend) for each of the six available genotypes in
Add Health (Materials and Methods). We restricted the sample
to friends who were not related, and we conducted a sibling
transmission disequilibrium test (sib-TDT), which includes the
average sibling genotype in the model and has been shown to
effectively control for population stratification (29­32). Fig. 3
shows the two genes that indicated significant correlation in both
the permutation test and the sib-TDT after Bonferroni correc-
tion. The TaqI A repeat-fragment length polymorphism in the
DRD2 gene (n = 1167, P = 0.008) showed significant positive
correlation (homophily), and the SNP rs1801272 in the CYP2A6
gene (n = 1175, P = 0.0001) indicated significant negative
correlation (heterophily).
We replicated the statistical procedure for these genotypes in
the FHS-Net using a TDT that includes parental genotypes to
control for population stratification (29­32). Imputed genotypes
for DRD2 and CYP2A6 made possible direct comparison with
the Add Health results (SI Appendix). Both genotypes, DRD2
(n = 3316, P = 0.006) and CYP2A6 (n = 1988, P = 0.02), show
significant correlation in the same direction and at about the
same magnitude in the FHS replication (Fig. 3).
Discussion
These results suggest that there is genotypic clustering in social
networks that exceeds what might be expected solely from pop-
ulation stratification. People's friends may not only have similar
traits, but actually resemble each other on a genotypic level, even
at the level of specific alleles and nucleotides.
It may seem improbable that two of the six genotypes we test
show signs of significant association, given that genome-wide

studies often find only a handful of candidate genotypes. How-
ever, it is important to remember that the six genes chosen for
genotyping by Add Health are those that were already known to
have significant effects on human social behavior. We suspect
that a genome-wide study would show that many genes in the
serotonin and dopamine pathway exhibit similar correlation, and
perhaps genes from other pathways relevant to social behavior or
neuronal development as well.
Indeed, the fact that the genes investigated here have also
been associated with certain behavioral and personality traits
helps shed light on one possible mechanism for this observation
(see SI Appendix for more detail regarding the known pheno-
types of these genes). For example, DRD2 has been associated
with alcoholism (33) and it is not hard to imagine that non-
drinkers may actively avoid alcoholics, or that alcoholics may be
drawn to environments that nondrinkers avoid. Less is known
about CYP2A6. This gene has been associated with the trait of
openness in one study (34), but it is not clear why people who
score highly on this trait would tend to associate with those who
do not. However, regardless of the causal mechanism, homophily
and heterophily on a specific allele is especially noteworthy be-
cause the phenotypes with which these genes are related are
likely polygenic (they are affected by many genes) and the genes
are also likely pleiotropic (they affect many traits).
Whatever the specific phenotypes that might be involved, the
significant negative correlation in CYP2A6 suggests that genetic
structure in human social networks does not arise solely because
of the tendency of people with similar genotypes to be drawn to
similar environments. That is, the mechanism at play in the asso-
ciation between friends' genotypes (whether homophily or heter-
ophily) may reflect, at least in part, active friendship choice
by individuals.
An important implication of these results is that genetic
structure in human populations may result not only from the
formation of reproductive unions, but also from the formation of
friendship unions within a population. This finding implies that
there may be a certain amount of omitted variable bias in as-
sociation studies. For example, a person with a genotype that
makes her susceptible to alcoholism may be directly influenced
to drink. However, she may also be indirectly influenced to drink
because she chooses friends with the same genotype (homophily)
who are more likely to make alcohol available to her. If so, then
an association test between alcoholism and genotype that does
not include friends' genotypes would overstate the effect of the
genes. In contrast, if she chooses friends with a different geno-
type (heterophily), they may be less likely to give alcohol to her.
If so, then the inhibitory effect of her friends' genes could
counteract the direct effect of her own genes and an association
test that omitted friends' genotypes would understate the effect
of one's own genotype.
Thus, homophily and heterophily in friendships, expressed at
the genetic level, may have notable implications for our un-
derstanding both of the way that our genes can shape our envi-
ronmental exposures and the way that our social environment
can influence our behavior (21, 22, 28, 35). A feedback process
might emerge whereby a person's genes lead to the selection of
friends with certain genotypes, which in turn facilitates or
modifies the expression of a person's own genes. The idea of an
evocative gene­environment interaction, proposed more than 30
y ago, suggests that a person's genes can lead him to seek out
circumstances that are compatible with his genotype (2, 36).
These circumstances could include not only the social behavior
of a person's friends, but also their very genes. Such a process
could also play out over longer time scales; the human evolu-
tionary environment is not limited to the physical and biological
environment, but also includes the social environment, which
may itself be an evolutionary force (37, 38).
To the extent that genes play a role in the formation of non-
reproductive unions, and to the extent that there is allelic simi-
larity in connected but biologically unrelated individuals, this
could constrain or facilitate a number of other biological and
social processes, from the spread of germs to the spread of in-
formation. In some sense, humans might be "metagenomic" not
just with respect to the microbes within them (39, 40), but also
with respect to the humans around them. We could possibly view
an individual's genetic landscape as a summation of the genes
within the individual and those around him, just as in certain
other organisms (14, 17).
There may even be genetic niches within social networks that
promote or inhibit the evolution of certain kinds of social be-
havior. The people to whom we are connected provide important
capabilities, from the ability to ward off infections, to the ability
to exploit or transmit useful information, to the ability to re-
ciprocate cooperative exchanges and thus enhance their payoffs
(35). For example, some individuals might be "immune" to
whatever pathogen is spreading in a population not because of
their own constitution, but rather because they have come to
surround themselves with others with particular genotypes.
Personality traits associated with being a leader, based in part on
certain genotypes, might best be matched with those in others
associated with being a follower. Or cooperation might most
easily arise and be sustained within social networks and friend-
ship connections of a particular kind (41). Perhaps genetic
properties of friendship groups might confer fitness advantages
to individuals who choose them.
Materials and Methods
For our candidate sample, we use data from the National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health. Add Health is a large nationally-representative and
publicly available study started in 1994 that explores the causes of health-
related behavior of adolescents in grades 7 through 12 and their outcomes in
young adulthood. In the first wave, information was gathered from subjects
in 142 schools about their social networks. Student's were allowed to
nominate up to five female and five male friends and were then asked more
specific details about those friendships.
In Wave I of the Add Health study, researchers created a genetically in-
formative sample of sibling pairs based on a screening of the in-school sample.
These pairs include all adolescents who were identified as twin pairs, half
siblings, or unrelated siblings raised together. Twins and half biological siblings
were sampled with certainty.TheWave I sibling-pairs samplehasbeen foundto

be similar in demographic composition to the full Add Health sample (42).
Subjects sometimes name family members as "friends," so we used this in-
formation to exclude from the friendship network all social ties to parents,
siblings, half-siblings, adopted siblings, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, and
cousins. Hence, remaining friends are unlikely to be genetically related.
Add Health produced genotype values from saliva samples collected in
Wave III for six genes, CYP2A6 (cytochrome P450 2A6), DRD2 (dopamine D2
receptor), DRD4 (dopamine D4 receptor), MAOA (monoamine oxidase A-
uVNTR), SLC6A3 (dopamine transporter), and SLC6A4 (serotonin trans-
porter). We provide a detailed description of each of these markers and their
associated phenotypes in the SI Appendix. DNA samples were genotyped at
the University of Colorado, Boulder, Institute of Behavior Genetics. The Add
Health study tested the validity of their genotyping protocols using pre-
amplified DNA compared with genomic DNA for 315 individuals from non-
Add Health samples, and found agreement in 98.7% of cases.
We identified all subject­friend pairs for which we had genetic in-
formation, and also race, sex, and age. To reduce the likelihood of false-
positives caused by population stratification, we conduct a sibling family
disequilibrium test, including siblings' mean genotype as a control (30). For
the purpose of this test, we only include as controls the genotypes of full
siblings and nonidentical twins (half siblings, identical twins, and all other
related pairs are excluded). To test for genetic homophily (positive associa-
tion) or heterophily (negative association) in Add Health, we regressed
friend's genotype on subject's genotype and included both the subject's and
friend's age, sex, and race as controls. Genotype takes the value 0, 1, or 2
depending on the number of minor alleles. Because some subjects name
multiple friends, we use generalized estimating equation regression (43)
with clustering within family and an independent working covariance
structure. Mean squared error fit statistics show the difference between
predicted and observed values for the model and a null model with no
covariates. Models with an exchangeable correlation structure yielded
poorer fit.
Because we conducted tests on six genetic markers, a Bonferroni correction
implies that the threshold for 95% confidence in an association is P = 0.05/6 =
0.008. SI Appendix, Table S1 A and B, show that three associations between
subject and friend genotype are significant at this level, but only two are
also significant in the permutation test shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S1.
For replication of these two candidate associations, we turned to the FHS.
We had to make some modifications in our analytic approach, compared with
the Add Health data, given the nature of the FHS data collection. In par-
ticular, we used a family-based TDT and we imputed SNPs to match the Add
Health loci.
The FHS is a population-based, longitudinal, observational cohort study
that was initiated in 1948 to prospectively investigate risk factors for car-
diovascular disease. Since then, it has come to be composed of four separate
but related cohort populations: (i) the "Original Cohort" enrolled in 1948
(n = 5,209); (ii) the "Offspring Cohort" (the children of the Original Cohort
and spouses of the children), enrolled in 1971 (n = 5,124); (iii) the "Omni
Cohort" enrolled in 1994 (n = 508); and (iv) the "Generation 3 Cohort" (the
grandchildren of the Original Cohort), enrolled beginning in 2002 (n =
4,095). Published reports provide details about sample composition and
study design for all these cohorts (44­46). As described elsewhere, we col-
lected information identifying who was connected to whom via ties of
friendship (and also ties of marriage, kinship, and so on) (21).
Out of the 14,428 members of the three main cohorts, a total of 9,237
individuals have been genotyped (4,986 women and 4,251 men). Genotyping
was conducted using the Affymetrix 500 K array and an Affymetrix 50 K
supplemental array. We had data on additional unobserved genotypes for
1,345 of the participants from an Affymetrix 100 K GeneChip array, so we
used PLINK 1.06 (47) to merge the two datasets by subject. We also merged
the data with European ancestry HapMap samples from Phase II and
Phase III.
We applied a number of recommended quality control measures to the
sample comprising all 9,237 individuals with genetic data (48, 49). First, we
dropped individuals who were missing genotypic information for 5% or
more of their available SNPs. High missingness indicates that a problem may
have occurred in the genotyping procedure for the individual. Next, we
deleted individual SNPs with a missing-data frequency greater than 2.5%.
Then we eliminated SNPs with minor allele frequency less than 1% because
low-frequency alleles are more likely to produce false high-magnitude
estimates in association tests. Finally, we excluded SNPs that failed a test of
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the 10-6 level. The null hypothesis of this test
is that the observed genotype frequencies are equal to their theoretical
expectations under random mating. A large departure from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium may be an indication of genotyping errors.
We used the SNPs that survived these quality checks to estimate the
pairwise relatedness between every single pair in the sample. Friendship pairs
that showed greater than zero percent of their genome identical by descent
were removed from the data to ensure that association in friend genotypes is
not, in fact, a result of people tending to make friends with family members.
None of the candidate genotypes from the Add Health study are available
in the FHS, but there are nearby SNPs that may be in linkage disequilibrium
with the Add Health markers. For CYP2A6 we used the proxy-impute com-
mand in PLINK to impute rs1801272. This procedure identified nine SNPs in
high-linkage disequilibrium with the target SNP, rs7259265, rs2561543,
rs2561528, rs2607414, rs41530251, rs7251418, rs8103444, rs10419393,
rs8192719, and yielded imputation of rs1801272 for 6,802 individuals. The
results should be treated with some caution because the INFO score in-
dicating the goodness of fit for this imputation was 0.697 (scores above 0.8
are preferred). However, as we will show below, an analysis of rs7251418
(the unimputed, nearby SNP in highest linkage with rs1801272) also suggests
significant heterophily for CYP2A6.
We also used PLINK to impute the rs1125394 for DRD2. This procedure
identified two SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with the target SNP,
rs3897584 and rs2471854, and yielded imputation of rs1125394 for 1,841
individuals. The INFO score indicating the goodness of fit for this imputation
was 0.997.
Although the individuals in the FHS are almost all of European ancestry,
population stratification has been shown to be a concern even in samples of
European Americans (50). Therefore, we used a family TDT (51) to partition
between-family variance and within-family variance. This test includes the
average number of alleles in the mother, father, or both (if known) as
a control for the contribution of between-family variance (b). This value is
subtracted from the genotype of the subject, and the coefficient on this
variable indicates the extent to which within-family variance (w) is associ-
ated with the dependent variable. Results of these tests are shown in SI
Appendix, Table S2.
Summary statistics for the variables in the regressions in SI Appendix, Table
S1 A and B, are shown in SI Appendix, Table S3. Summary statistics for the
variables in the regressions in SI Appendix, Table S2, are shown in SI Ap-
pendix, Table S4.
Finally, because the INFO score on the imputation for rs1801272 was
somewhat low, in SI Appendix, Table S5, we show the results of a regression
for rs7251418, the unimputed nearby SNP in highest linkage with rs1801272
(r = 0.30, distance = 12.9 K base pairs). These unimputed results also suggest
the existence of significant heterophily (P = 0.04) in the region of CYP2A6.
