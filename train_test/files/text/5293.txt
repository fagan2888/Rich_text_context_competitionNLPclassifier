"Colonialism wasn't simply the creation of unnatural borders or
unfair terms of trade, it was something experienced . . . day after
day, year after year."
--President Barack Obama (July 11, 2009)
Introduction
Shortly before independence was declared, Time wrote of
"Nigeria's impressive demonstration of democracy work-
ability inAfrica" (Crowder, 1987, p. 8). Thus, at the lowering
of the British Union Jack on the midnight of September 30,
1960 and declaration of independence on October 1, 1960,
expectations were understandably high-pitched that Nigeria
had all it might take to lead Africa, not just as an emerging
first superpower but also as a stabilizing force on the conti-
nent (Siollun, 2009). In the gratifying words of Sir Abubakar
Tafawa Balewa, the first Prime Minister, to the departing
British Governor-General, Sir James Robertson, Nigerians
"are grateful to the British officers, whom we have known as
masters, and then as leaders, and finally as partners, and
always as friend" (Betts, 1985, p. 200). For the most part too,
the prospect of a vibrant nation, especially one with the larg-
est concentration of Black people in the world and an appar-
ently sound agrarian economy with bountiful oil reserve
waiting to be tapped, was more real than apparent.
Before long, however, the country once toasted by the
international community as the beacon of liberal democratic
values in Africa and the economic powerhouse of the African
continent became the subject of economic difficulty, political
violence, and growing poverty among Nigerians (Wittaker,

Proto-Nationalisms as Sub-Text for the
Crisis of Governance in Nigeria
Taiwo Akanbi Olaiya1
Abstract
There are several accounts of the genealogy and manifestations of the myriad governance crises, which Nigeria continues
to face five decades after independence. Although no single account is sufficient to explain the governance misadventures,
one key point resonating is that progress and development have proved elusive over the years. In this article, we seek to
move away from the dominant characterization of this governance crisis as deriving directly from the consequences of a
monolithic oil economy, a deeply fractured and volatile political terrain, or even corrupt and patrimonial rule. Instead, the
article locates the root of Nigeria's governance crisis in the queer pattern of the emergence, reinvention, and manipulation
of proto-nationalisms characterized not by any nationalistic quest for independence and spatial liberation but one pursued
to gain foothold in governance and to partake in its perquisites. Invariably, the post-colonial nation-states that emerged at
independence in many African countries, for the most part, neither followed through with any logical expression of genuine
nationalism nor mobilized toward a shared vision of nationhood. The article shows how individuals and groups within the
polity soon became locked in contested and irreconcilable positions that further made the construction of a truly nationalistic
identity difficult, if not forlorn. This article submits that successive post-colonial administrations unimaginatively followed the
divide-and-rule traditions of the colonial state and thus failed to mobilize the popular support required for the construction
of a broad-based national identity that is key to managing the protracted governance crises the country has experienced
since independence.

1991). Within the first few years of independence, the new
country became convulsive, at least politically, beginning
with the degeneration of the constitutional crisis in the
Western Regional House of Assembly. Thereafter, and in
quick succession, other politically driven conflicts began to
erupt: the suspension of the Constitution and declaration of
state of emergency in the Western Region, intense intra-party
and inter-party rivalries, trumped up treason charges against
vociferous opposition leaders, and the general overheating of
the polity reflecting in political violence and the attendant
state repression, to mention a few.
But, then, it would seem that the contentious political
climate that the country degenerated into was not antici-
pated, certainly not by the generation of nationalist leaders
that painstakingly--but also enthusiastically--negotiated
the country's independence. Indeed, there were indications
that the erstwhile nationalists on whose laps the mantle of
political powers fell were fully committed to the tenets of
liberal democracy, albeit the British Westminster variant.
Although there were moments of mixed feelings during the
series of conferences to negotiate independence (Crowder,
1987), especially over the terms of engagement between
and among the component political units, there was unfor-
tunately also an implicit convergence of interest among the
regional governments and their dominant political parties
that several critical issues were either overlooked or swept
under the carpet.
By any means, however, Nigeria was not a political bas-
ket case as the political events that unfolded in the country
also resonated across Africa. For the most part too, the
attainment of independence did not fundamentally trans-
form the structure of governance in most African states.
Just as well, the political class that replaced the departing
colonial officers--having been tutored in the best traditions
of colonial administration--was only committed to the pro-
tection of the "colonial legacy" rather than to pursue any
radical agenda to uproot and replace it. Apart from uphold-
ing the colonial legacy, the nationalists embraced the
authoritarian bureaucratic practices of their predecessors;
grosso modo, the new independent African states retained
the forces of authoritarianism and detachment from the
public that were the key hallmarks of colonial rule. Rather
than come to terms with and transcend the contradictions of
the notorious past, the post-colonial states and the political
elite that ran them after independence retained the essential
attributes, idiosyncrasies, and characteristics of their colo-
nial mentors.
It is against the backdrop of the earliest experiences of
governance misgivings that faced Nigeria, and other African
countries, that this article is set. Although there are several
accounts of the genealogy and manifestations of the myriad
of governance crises which Nigeria continues to face five
decades after independence, our point here is that no single
factor is sufficient to explain the country's governance mis-
adventures. Yet, one key point of convergence is that
progress and development have so far eluded it due to its
plethora of perennial and burdensome governance problems.
In this article, we seek to move away from the dominant
characterization of the governance crisis facing Nigeria as
being a direct consequence of her perverted oil economy, a
deeply fractured and volatile political terrain, or even corrup-
tion and patrimonial rule. Instead, the article locates the root
of the country's governance crisis in the queer pattern of the
emergence, reinvention, and embrace of proto-nationalisms
characterized not by the any nationalistic demand for inde-
pendence for its sake but that which simply, and implicitly,
favored gaining a share of government and its perquisites
without any serious commitment to values such as integrity
and service.
Historical facts revealed that the so-called nationalists
had dissipated little or no effort toward anticipating the fate
of the state to be bestowed to them (Geddes, 2010; Olaiya,
2014). Ironically, they were prominent figures in the inter/
intra-ethnic crisis that pervaded in the period of pre-indepen-
dence jostling. Writing on the political experiences of
Nigeria, Geddes observed that the supposedly crucial period
of struggles for state formation was in fact characterized by
"bitter and tempestuous" engagement between leaders of
North and South:
Strong resentment amongst minority ethnic groups at the
organisation of the new state . . . rivalries which developed
between the major ethnic groups and their parties in the pre-
independence period . . . strong antipathies and resentments on
the part of the citizens. He argued that these resentments and
tensions were to result in the destabilisation of both regional and
federal governments . . . [and] as Anifowose says, "It was against
this back-ground of deep-rooted distrust and conflict among
Nigerian politicians, that Nigeria became independent." (Geddes,
2010, pp. 4-6)
Notes on Nationalism and
Proto-Nationalism in Nigeria
Nationalism as a political and social philosophy begins from
the premise that the welfare of the nation-state is at the epi-
center of the discourse on politics and governance. Basically,
the notion of nationalism describes a collective state of mind
or consciousness in which people believe that their primary
duty and loyalty is to the nation, with a lot of emphasis placed
on national superiority and glorification of certain national
cultural virtues. Although the idea of nationalism has an ata-
vistic past, its modern-day reincarnation is sometimes traced
to the 1789 French Revolution (Virtanen, 2005). In contem-
porary times, the idea of nationalism operates alongside for-
mal legal and institutional frameworks of society as
ingredients for the construction of political order and social
cohesiveness in any state. For a group of people to express
nationalism, they must first identify themselves as belonging
to a nation, that is, a large group of people with shared identi-
ties based on common history, religion, language, race, to
Olaiya 3
name a few (Ajala, 2009). In other words, where common
identity and formal authority structure over a large territory
(i.e., the state) exist, nationalism becomes possible.
Although nationalism is unique to the modern world,
some of its elements can be traced throughout history. The
earliest roots of nationalism are probably to be found among
the ancient Hebrews who conceived of themselves as a cho-
sen people, that is, a people superior to others and with a
common culture and history. The ancient Greeks also felt
superior to all other peoples, apart from their shared loyalty
to the political community. The growth of the middle class
and the thirst of that group for political power, in turn, paved
way for democratic theory and practices closely connected
with the emergence of modern nationalism. Drivers of the
French Revolution, for instance, insisted on establishing
freedom, equality, and liberty; effectively, they viewed the
nation as inseparable from the people. The idea propounded
by the French revolutionaries glorified the nation, and in
doing so, brought nationalism into the political domain for
the first time.
This article tinkers with the complexity of the problem
exerted by the nature and structure of African nationalism
and how that has contributed in great measure to the failure
of governance in the post-colonies. We bear in mind here the
caution against infinite number or loose use of what
Barrington (1997) called "`something' nationalisms." Yet,
the adoption of the term proto-nationalism is in line with the
coinage of Crowder (1987), which he used to demarcate
actual nationalists whose ultimate aim is to struggle for
national identity and autonomous political community that is
capable of self-determination from the opportunistic nation-
alists whose aim is to gain the rein of government. We there-
fore found the concept of "proto-nationalism," as enunciated
in Crowder (1987), appropriate to describe the uncritical and
hasty acceptance of (conditions of the) nations handed over
to the so-called nationalists at independence. Nationalism, as
Barrington (1997) rightly argued, is not about the patriotism
to the nation-state within the framework of international
state system but a people's loyalty to the ideal of shared cul-
tural identity and self-determination. As we have thus argued
later in this article, such movements hardly conform to
nationalism, properly so called, which "is about two things-
defining the nation and defining its territory" (Barrington,
1997, pp. 714-715). The movements that led to independence
in Nigeria particularly was not geared toward ethnic or cul-
tural identity but about a collective mobilization of all forces
available for power shift from White rulers to Black ones.
This is the concept of proto-nationalisms, described in
Crowder's (1987) epic book and adopted in the work.
In particular, it brings to the fore the fundamental point
that the nationalism that was marshaled in the struggle for
independence and state making in these former colonies did
not conform with known temperament of nationalism in
which nationhood forms the primary motive and in which
common custom and ancestry form the bedrock for struggles
to gain "territorial autonomy and sovereignty" (Barrington,
1997, p. 714). Rather, the struggles took place within the con-
text of territoriality arbitrarily demarcated by colonialists--
but that which did not correspond with the realities of each
group--the boundaries either dismantled or completely oblit-
erate existing primordial nations and replaced it with carved
territories for easy administration (Olaiya, 2014). For
instance, a considerable part of northern Nigeria "was part of
a north African caliphate, with a number of well-organised
emirates whose territories existed within and overlapped parts
of the current nations of Nigeria, Chad, Sudan and Cameroon"
(Geddes, 2010, p. 2). The same largely predominates in the
southern Nigeria where "a number of independent kingdoms
existed," which also often extended beyond present national
and regional boundaries (p. 2).
Nationalism certainly cannot mean the bandying together
of strange bed-fellows or attempt to mix "oil with water"
(Clifford, 1921, p. 12). As Geddes (2010) pointed out,
The naivety of planners was evident in the way in which
potential problems were handled in the lead-up to independence.
Despite the early warnings of writers like Awolowo and
experiences of other West African postcolonial countries, it was
assumed that with the establishment of democracy, tribalism and
ethnic difference would fade as people learned to identify
themselves primarily with the nation rather than with their own
ethnic communities. (p. 3)
Considering the huge difference of ethnological, religious,
and political conditions of the inhabitants (Clifford, 1921),
the nationalists could have indeed seen beyond the artificial
nations created from colonies. In his book titled Path to
Nigerian Freedom, Awolowo (1947) argued that the uncriti-
cal acceptance and nature of the colonial territory known as
Nigeria is bound to be fatal. According to him,
There are various national or ethnical groups in the country . . .
There is as much difference between them as there is between
Germans, English, Russians and Turks for instance. The fact that
they have a common [Colonial] overlord does not destroy this
fundamental difference . . . All these incompatibilities among
the various peoples in the country militate against unification
. . . It is evident from the experiences of other nations that
incompatibilities such as we have enumerated are barriers which
cannot be overcome by glossing over them. (Awolowo, 1947,
pp. 48-49, emphasis added)
The colonialists deliberately played down on ethnic
coalescing for reasons good for selfish, albeit contingent,
purposes of hitch-free administration while the "national-
ists" equally played along for obvious reason of opportunis-
tic rule beyond their kinsmen (Olaiya, 2014). As expected,
in West Africa, the "nationalists" preferred to identify them-
selves as Nigerians rather than Yoruba, Hausa, or Igbo; Gold
Coaster rather than Akan, Ewe, or Guan; Senegalese rather
than Wollof; Ivoirians rather than Baoules (Crowder, 1976,
4 SAGE Open
pp. 405-407). However, the intention of the colonialists was
not to eradicate ethnicity but to stem the expressions of
nationalism they produce and perhaps also to prevent tribal
conflicts. Thus, the acceptance of the arbitrary colonial bor-
ders (and subsequent location of the processes of nation
building within them) smacks of naivety and/or willful
acquiesces, which became a major factor underlying the
governance crisis that erupted thereafter. The colonial rulers
and successors in governments desired independence with-
out properly interrogating the inter-territoriality and intra-
boundary peculiarities of the people of banded communities,
their identities, and ethnic idiosyncrasy. For the most part,
the emerged nation-states were so incongruent and strange
to the peoples that rather than lead to the liberation of those
particular spaces, the people interacted more in open aggres-
sion cum conflict or, at best, mutual suspicion (Davidson,
1992). As noted elsewhere, countless African leaders con-
tinued abrasively in the misapplications and, in fact, aggra-
vated them with added patrimonialism and corruption
flavors (Sachs et al., 2004). Sachs et al. (2004) concluded
that it might be factual that the emerged "leaders hanged
themselves and their fellow citizens, the rich countries often
provided the rope." (p. 136)
An immediate implication of this lack of convergence
between nation and territoriality was that it conferred on the
nascent post-colonial leadership the right of appropriation,
not just that of territory but also of unlimited discretion to
exercise power. In any case, the acceptance of these frontiers
also automatically created the necessity to cope with the
forging minuscule nationhood from the disparate ethnic and
sub-ethnic nationalities. It appears not accidental therefore
that the pluralism of ethnicity in post-colonial Africa tow-
ered well above any other factor in fomenting crises of gov-
ernance on the continent (Mkandawire, 2005). It might be
that the nationalists also recognized the potential centrifugal
impacts of ethnic pluralism but only as part of the "divide-
and-rule" ploy of their colonial oppressors bent on denying
them independence (Mkandawire, 2005). They failed to
come to terms with the deeper structural meaning and impli-
cations of plural ethnicities for politics and governance then,
and now. Perhaps they also appreciated, rightly so, that the
ethnic groups in existence at the dawn of independence were
just too tiny, ill developed, and in some instances thinly
spread across colonial boundaries, to stand alone as modern
states, not thus swayed by the implications that the situation
might portend for the construction of nationhood. Another
factor that seemed to have bothered pioneer nationalists was
the language barrier; with scores of distinctive but mutually
unintelligible dialects coexisting side by side. While they
saw this heterogeneity as a recipe for disaster, they were
filled with the illusion of nationhood and that was all that
was necessary--if not sufficient--to bring disparate groups
together under the same political umbrella, albeit one that
could not be trusted with longevity and protection. They
solicited an essentially European imagery of nationhood; one
inclined toward the myth of one language, one culture, one
identity. It was too cumbersome to contemplate an alterna-
tive idea of nationhood protruding from a multiethnic, multi-
lingual, and multicultural political clime. For instance, the
Richards Constitution of 1946 had advocated "unity in diver-
sity" but in practice had to contend with the underbellies of
diversity between and among the nationalities that made up
modern Nigeria.
Many critics have argued that the scissors effect of proto-
nationalism and pan-Africanism merely celebrated the inde-
pendence of African nations while ignoring, for the most
part, the ethno-social and cultural basis of their existence and
survival. While absolving themselves of the responsibility of
aggravating governance problems in the immediate post-
colonial era, the political leaders of the nascent African states
were quick to remind their people that "political indepen-
dence could only have meaning if it was accompanied by
historical independence" (Ogot, 1976, p. 1). In spite of the
fact that the independence of African states was defective
from birth, Patrice Lumumba1 was enthusiastic--even
though economical with the truth--in proclaiming that
history will have its say one day--not the history they teach in
Brussels, Paris, Washington or United Nations, but the history
taught in the countries set free from colonialism and puppet
rulers. Africa will write her own history, and both north and
south of the Sahara, it will be a history of glory and dignity.
(Quoted in Cole, 2006, p. 29)
Because of the enormous challenges they faced, espe-
cially in rallying their disparate citizens toward genuine and
home-grown nationalisms, post-independence African lead-
ers refused to acknowledge that the states they inherited were
undifferentiated and amorphous entities (Ochwada, 2005).
They grossly simplified the character and directions of the
struggles they are engaged in (Mkandawire, 2005). The real-
ity, of course, was that nationalism as a homogenizing and
unifying factor did not take adequate cognizance of the
diverse composition of groups on ground in most African
nations. Even with the much-touted "unity in diversity" pro-
gram of Governor Richards in Nigeria and his post-colonial
successors to date, other identities along class, gender, and
ethnicity lines continue to thrive, often with unpleasant out-
comes (Mama, 2005). The situation, in turn, resulted not
only in the unending challenges of nation building and devel-
opment but also that of social injustice, economic misman-
agement, and deep-seated governance crisis.
It was precisely for this reason that Ngugu Wa Thiong'o
once warned that for any country in Africa to advance and
escape the vestiges of underdevelopment--as well as nurture
a sharper vision of the future--the collective memories of its
peoples (leaders and citizens, alike) must be rescued from
the clutches of the colonial past (Mkandawire, 2005).
Unfortunately, Nigerian nationalism did not uncritically
embrace wholesale the "modernity" prescribed by the
Olaiya 5
colonial masters; none of the partakers that emerged within
the radicalized environment of nationalist struggles, from
Ghana to Tanzania, sought to an ideology and identity that
would give governance and development in their respective
countries an African soul. Witness, for instance, Kwame
Nkrumah's "African Personality," Leopold Senghor's
"Negritude," Julius Nyerere's "Ujamaa" (African Socialism),
as well as the likes of Amicar Cabral and Frantz Fanon in
Guinea Bissau and Algeria (Mkandawire, 2005).
In Tanzania, for instance, President Nyerere had
deployed Ujamaa as the philosophical template for national
development through the fostering of national self-reliance
based on the transformation of economic and cultural atti-
tudes. Economically, it required that everyone worked for
the group as well as the self. Culturally, Tanzanians must
learn to free themselves from dependence on European
ideas and powers, including learning to do things for them-
selves and be satisfied with what was achieved. It also
involved the implementation of free and compulsory edu-
cation for all Tanzanians to sensitize them to the principles
of Ujamaa. Despite the innovative ideas behind it, Ujamaa
has been blamed for the catastrophic collapse of the econ-
omy, which left several people close to starvation and
death. At the least, the wide acceptance of the idea and
practice--unlike Nnamdi Azikiwe's "irredentism" and
Obafemi Awolowo's "socialism" that never reached
national limelight in Nigeria--pointed to the feasibility of
idioms of nationalism on the continent, if property contex-
tualized and mobilized (Iweriebo, 1996).
Our intention here is not to rehearse the literature of
nationalism in Nigeria per se; we, in fact, acknowledge the
sheer diversity and quality of scholarship on the subject mat-
ter. Instead, the concern is to solicit fresh and alternative per-
spectives on why the post-colonial state has been a victim of
seemingly endless crisis. Essentially, this article located the
roots of state failure in Nigeria in the queer character of mod-
ern state formation occasioned as it were, not by true nation-
alism but by the pursuit of parochial agenda masquerading as
nationalism. The notion of proto-nationalism, in our view,
best defines this strange, largely fake, typology of national-
ism. In his seminal work Nations and Nationalism since
1870: Programme, Myth, and Reality, the British social his-
torian E. J. Hobsbawm provided a strong theoretical anchor
to moor the discourse on proto-nationalisms (Hobsbawm,
2004). According to him, proto-nationalism describes the
"bonds" existing in human beings with tangential collectivi-
ties or community of interest and purpose, pursuing mem-
bers' goals on a macro-political scale to the exclusion of
others, whom they regard as strangers. For Hobsbawm,
members in these "bonds" may not necessarily belong to the
same ethnic group but still share certain feelings of collective
belonging, which they vigorously pursue. Another point
from his conceptualization of proto-nationalisms is that the
select groups are eventually capable of converting their
bonds and vocabularies of mobilization into generalizations
about their desires for and engagement with the state, colo-
nial and post-colonial.
Furthermore, another core attribute of proto-nationalism,
according to Hobsbawm, is that the elites and their proto-
nationalist ideas are often insulated from ethnicity, racism, or
"negative views of others" (2004, p. 18). He, however, raised
a caveat that although racism or ethnicity may not be impor-
tant in developing proto-nationalism, its role become essen-
tial in gaining mass appeal by the elites, most especially
when the need to democratize nationalism arises (Hobsbawm,
2004). At these crucial times, it would seem that proto-
nationalists would not hesitate to draw on xenophobic senti-
ments for reinventing the idea of national superiority to
mobilize the masses. Significantly, this perspective identi-
fied a positive correlation between archetypes of nationalism
and mobilization against those considered to be out-group,
arguing, in fact, that "there is no more effective way of bond-
ing together the disparate section of restless peoples than to
unite them against outsiders" (p. 18). In one instance, there-
fore, proto-nationalists could express repulsion against eth-
nicity or racism, while in another, non-hesitant to mobilize
them to attract mass consciousness.
Only two out of the plethora of developments associated
with proto-nationalism are particularly relevant here, espe-
cially given the manner in which they have assumed rele-
vance and resilience, for good or bad, in post-independence
Nigeria: religion and ethnicity (Norbu, 2005). It has long
been established that a strong linkage exists between nation-
alistic struggle and religion (Hvithamar, 2009). Hobsbawm
(2004, p. 68), again, insisted that religion is an ancient and
well-tried method for establishing communion through com-
mon practice and sort of brotherhood between people, who
otherwise have nothing in common. In terms of how the
power configuration of nationalism affects the masses, he
argued that religion is an issue around which members of
communities coalesced in the era of proto-nationalism
(Hedetoft, 2009; Hobsbawm, 2004). This is buttressed by the
submission of Denzer (2007). In his article titled "Anti-
Colonial Movements, Sub-Saharan Africa" published in the
Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice, the author
described how "[R]eligious institutions were especially resil-
ient vehicles for the organisations of widespread resistance
that often cut across ethnic groups and colonial boundaries"
(Denzer, 2007, p. 6). He described how, between 1908 and
1928, the Nyabingi religious cult successfully organized and
prosecuted recurrent inter-colonial rebellions in British
Uganda and German (later Belgian) Rwanda. However, the
struggle for independence in Nigeria hardly involved reli-
gious coloration. Except probably in the northern part, where
call for unity centered on Islam as Attahiru, the Caliph of
Sokoto, famously "attempted to evade certain British con-
quest by conducting hijira" in 1903 (p. 6), the major item of
conflict during the decolonization period was ethnicity. It is
essential to be added, however, that after independence, reli-
gion surfaced as the instrument of unity and force for the
6 SAGE Open
promotion of sectional interest and of violence (Olaiya,
2014). Religious intolerance is thus a major institutional fail-
ure in Nigeria, and despite the entrenchment of secularism in
the Nigerian Constitutions (1979 and 1999), religion contin-
ues to wreck ominous havoc on the Nigerian governance.
In this regard, the notion and practice of ethnicity, some-
times with religious undertone, is rampant (Omotola, 2010).
Since independence, Nigeria has experienced "a catalogue of
ethno-religious conflicts that resulted in an estimated loss of
over 3 million lives and unquantifiable psychological and
material damages" (Salawu, 2010, p. 1). Nigeria has more
than 400 ethnic groups, distributed among two major reli-
gions of mainly Christianity and Islam (Salawu, 2010).
Despite these formidable statistics, it does not mechanically
follow that the sheer large number of the ethnic groups and
tribes should translate to tribalism and ethnocentrism (Ukeje
& Adebanwi, 2006). A possible explanation must therefore
be in the hasty and uncritical manner in which the proto-
nationalists accepted the state making without making neces-
sary recourse to work on the psyche of the populace as a
nation. As propagated by writers on proto-nationalism, mod-
ernization is a feature of proto-nationalism (Hobsbawm,
2004), but the Nigerian case runs to the contrary. Ethnicity
among the majority groups and minority groups in both pre-
and post-independent era has challenged the popular linkage
between proto-nationalism and advent of modernization.
There are countless cases of clashes among the ethnic groups,
in which properties and city monuments are destroyed.
On the political scene, an institution of zoning formula is
used to adopt candidates for important party positions, elec-
tive and appointive offices, without respect for democratic
values or acumen. Hence, Nigeria's political and economic
performance falls below par in comparison with other coun-
tries of comparable size and resources. The "federal charac-
ter" principle introduced by the 1979 Constitution, and
continued in 1999 Constitution, was designed to ensure the
equitable representation of various ethnic groups in the
national affairs, most especially insofar as federal appoint-
ments are very much concerned. Related to the quota system
and Federal character policy is the educationally disadvan-
taged states clause,2 which opportune indigenes of states so
labeled to be considered for admission into federal educa-
tional institutions at grades far less than merit point.
However, the implementation of this principle leaves so
much to desire. The problem is obviously more than the fact
that "it tends to sacrifice merit for mediocrity leading to disaf-
fection among the populace" (Metumara, 2010, p. 98), there
is the non-recognition of the cultural needs and true demo-
graphic strength of the ethnic groups. Thus apart from the
clueless implementation of the policy, its conception took no
cognizance of the diverse ethno-cultural peculiarities of the
nationalities and their drive and needs in which, for instance,
the educational infrastructural needs of each state differ, and
in some cases, very tremendously. The general implication of
ethno-religious politicking is that ethnocentrism and lack of
patriotism reign supreme. The political atmosphere is domi-
nated by "big men" rather than "big institutions," as identified
by President Barrack Obama of the United States.3 The vast
majority of the populace is politically relegated to passive
onlookers, not even voters, as the votes do not count again
due to widespread electoral malpractices.
In the light of all the above, a recurrent implication of the
resilience of proto-nationalism has been the characteristic
lack of politicization in terms of social communication and
mass mobilization in a manner that could easily key the citi-
zenry into any broad national agenda, in a manner that is
sustainable, "own-able," and patriotic. Thus, when a society
is constructed from the crucible of proto-nationalism, it is
unlikely for it to transcend the challenges of frequent--often
divisive--particularistic interests, as the post-colonial expe-
riences of Nigeria in the section that follows reveal.
Proto-Nationalism and the Governance
Misadventures in Nigeria
There is a particularly critical genre of scholarship that
argued that nationalism never took place in Nigeria (Norbu,
2005), at least, going by the definition of the concept not as
popular loyalty to the states manufactured from colonial ter-
ritories and its legalistic and Eurocentric characteristics dic-
tated by colonialism but as a distinctive type of politicized
social consciousness originating from within the core of the
societal fabrics (Norbu, 2005). According to Norbu, nation-
alism connotes the mobilization of broad-based national--
rather than group--consciousness to wrest power from (not
to wrestle with) the imperialists. In this regard, it is seen as a
"specific historical phenomenon" involving the holistic
reconfiguration of the social consciousness of a nation, and
beyond this, the spillover of such consciousness in the politi-
cal and economic sphere as a prelude to the emergence of an
industrial society (Norbu, 2005). The integration would nat-
urally increase social communication among members
within a given society. He wrote that
nationalism is the resultant ideological expression of a highly
organized and politicized society, with its both rational and non-
rational foundations. Its non-rational aspects which provide
protein for nationalism predates the modern nation-state and
without such a psychic core, nationalism would be practically
inconceivable in the modern era. In short, nationalism cannot be
invented by a minority; it has to be passionately felt by the
majority. (p. 29, emphasis added)
The thrust of Norbu's (2005) argument, therefore, was
that nationalism in its essentialist form never really occurred
in Nigeria not only for the predominantly bourgeois charac-
ter of the struggle for independence but also for the fact that
the focus was on capturing power instead of real national
emancipation. This is an often ignored perspective, but one
that is critical in understanding why the operators of the
Olaiya 7
commercial and industrial segments of the colonial infra-
structure did not feel sufficiently threatened to leave with
their political, military, and consular counterparts as soon as
independence was achieved. It seemed obvious to them that
the three dominant regional political parties were divided in
purpose and only eager to occupy the political space leaving
economic space, like the British firms like the UnitedAfrican
Company (UAC), John Holt, Leventis, intact (Crowder,
1987). The peculiar brand of African nationalism and its con-
notations have been aptly canonized by Frantz Fanon in
1966. Even though Fanon was referring to Africa as a whole,
his narrative bespoke the circumstances surrounding nation-
alism in Nigeria, more than elsewhere (Mkandawire, 2005).
Fanon argued vehemently against bourgeois anti-colonial
nationalism whose goal he saw as "quite simply . . . [to]
transfer into native hands . . . those unfair advantages which
are the legacies of colonialism." Their mission, according to
him, "has nothing to do with transforming the nation; it con-
sists, prosaically, of being the transmission line between the
nation and a capitalism, rampant though camouflaged, which
today puts on the mask of neo-colonialism" (quoted in
Mkandawire, 2005, p. 21).
Because British colonialism formed Nigeria through a
process likable to political artificial insemination, which
brought a disparate group of peoples and regions together,
the nationalism that became a political factor in Nigeria dur-
ing the interwar period derived less from any sense of com-
mon nationality than pan-Africanism (Mkandawire, 2005).
Indeed, the initial goal of this struggle was not self-determi-
nation but simply to secure greater participation in gover-
nance at the regional level. Inconsistencies in British policy
reinforced cleavage along regional lines as regional elites
simultaneously struggled to preserve the indigenous cultures
of each area while embracing modernity (British ways of
governance). In the North, however, the widespread appeal
of Islamic religion did not only uphold the rule and legiti-
macy of the emirs but also ensured that the bourgeoning
nationalist sentiments were decidedly anti-Western. In the
South, however, the largely westernized nationalist elites
opposed indirect rule, considering it an anathema for exclud-
ing them from the political space.
The Nigerian state has certainly passed through a number
of hard times. Much and recurrent as the problems are, there
have never been a dearth of attempts to locate the bottom
line. Generally, much of the criticisms have been leveled
against the politicians, who have purportedly derailed the
legacy of liberal democracy inherited from the colonial mas-
ters, and the military, who have ruled the nation much more
than the civilian administration and have perpetuated more
socioeconomic atrocities. In terms of governance dividends,
the report cards of the military have been worse than that of
the politicians considering all indices for measurement of
governance. The "high hope" that Nigeria will emerge as a
dominant power bloc was soon truncated by military coup
(Siollun, 2009). The military have wrecked most havoc in
the Nigerian governance crisis as all indices of institutional
collapse received more knocks even after the advent of "cor-
rection" regimes. This complements, to an extent, the belief
in some quarters that the military in politics are agency of
conservatism and destabilization, as well as that of economic
destruction (Oyediran, 1996). Oyediran (1996) found the
right quotation about the Nigerian military from Professor
Billy J. Dudley, as follows:
. . . their (the military) incapacity to rule derives, not from the
fact that they lack legitimacy, but that, like the politicians they
have ousted, they get caught in the cross current of personal,
lineage, clan, ethnic and other loyalties and sentiments which
influenced and shaped the actions of politicians. (p. 98, emphasis
in original)
However, we intend to posit that military advent and the ulti-
mate misadventure into the Nigerian politics are products of
colonization, decolonization, and queer nationalistic strug-
gles all of which jointly and severally configured the state of
Nigeria. Broadly, we intend to argue that the origin of mili-
tary rule in Africa lied with nature and style adopted in the
colony, when most political resistance were finally resolved
by military incursions and where constabulary police are
used freely to silence all voices of dissents. A renowned his-
torian argued that
the many studies of resistance to colonial occupation have
shown that for the most part the colonial state was conceived in
violence rather than by negotiation. This violence was often
quite out of proportion to the task in hand, with burnings of
villages, destruction of crops, killing of women and children and
the execution of leaders . . . The colonial state was not only
conceived in violence, but it was maintained by the free use of it
. . . Indeed if the colonial state provided a model for its inheritors
it was that government rested not on consent but force. [And]
not a few of those who eventually inherited power knew from
personal experience. (Crowder, 1987, pp. 11-13)
This claim becomes robust by the assertion that military
officers who trained and served under the colonial armies in
West Africa impelled the proliferation of military coups in
the sub-region; a situation that only worsened the problem of
corruption (Kieh & Agbese, 2004). However, military mis-
rule originated from the nature of colonial rule in its "delib-
erate discouragement of mass politics as all military and
quasi-military regimes are liable to do" (Ekeh, 1996, p. 35).
Ekeh (1996) argued that
whatever legitimacy . . . the colonial authorities possessed
derived . . . from the monopoly of the means of the means of
violence . . . Colonial administrators were in fact "praetors" and
the system of rule was authoritarian and dictatorial. (p. 35)
From the above, it seems clear that the seed of military incur-
sion and their misrule and most certainly the civilian lack of
8 SAGE Open
respect for rule of law had been sown during the colonial era
only waiting to be [and did get] activated after independence.
Corruption is yet another problem for which Nigerian
governance crisis has been explained. There can be no doubt
that corruption and lack of accountability pervade Nigerian
public and private institutions, and the corrupt practices have
taken an adverse toll on the governance of the nation. We
however argue that corruption in Nigeria is more of a product
of modern governance system established and continually
fanned by the embers of colonial aristocratic heritage,
whereby the rulers live large at the expense of the people. For
instance, the colonial Governor "enjoyed to the full the out-
ward trappings of power, living in an imposing palace, driven
in large limousines flying the flag, deferred to by all, and on
ceremonial occasions dressed in cocked hat and plumes and
a quasi-military uniform" (Crowder, 1987, p. 15). It would
therefore be appropriate to argue that lack of accountability
for public fund resulting in such affluent lifestyle on the part
of European officers coupled with lack of proper institution
of necessary checks, which made such impunity impossible
in the home countries of the colonial masters, and which the
hurried circumstances of the independence disallowed in the
new states, are germane factors for the entrenchments and
pervasiveness of corruption in the sub-region.
As far as policy failure is concerned, public policies are
not arrived at by trial and errors made without the historical
or socioeconomic preconditions (Mkandawire & Soludo,
1999). According to them, the initial conditions must neces-
sarily take into cognizance the "nature of colonial rule and
the institutional arrangements it bequeath the former colo-
nies, the decolonization process, and the economic interests
and policies of the erstwhile colonial masters" (Mkandawire
& Soludo, 1999, pp. 2, 3). It therefore follows that to avoid
the invidious socioeconomic and political manifestations
afflicting most African states, a painstaking appreciation in
the initial condition is essential, and that wrongly specifying
these initial conditions can undermine the potentials of the
policies.
Nationalism and Governance Crisis in
Nigeria
A number of explanations have been outlined for the recal-
citrance of governance or state failure in Nigeria. A good
starting point is that there is need for a development para-
digmatic shift, which would explain and offer solutions to
problems of industrialization, agriculture, and other eco-
nomic development component. Nationalism is deeply con-
nected to economic development (Mkandawire, 2005).
Nationalist project is an important key to nation building
and economic development; the two are virtually insepara-
ble (Mkandawire, 2005).
Another opinion is that development idea fostered on the
economy is alien and therefore forlorn; an opinion that is as
false as it is insulting to Nigerian intellectuals and political
leaders who have toiled relentlessly to seek material progress
to the Nigerian society. In fact, looking at the nationalism
historiography, it is clear that development, described as the
eradication of "unholy trinity of ignorance, poverty, and dis-
ease" (Mkandawire, 2005, p. 13), has always been a central
focus of nationalist agenda. Indeed, a common slogan against
colonialism was the failure to provide clear development
framework for industrialization and mechanization of agri-
culture (Crowder, 1987). Yet, upon the attainment of inde-
pendence, the central objectives of those lofty development
ideas, muted and vituperatively propounded were derailed by
the nationalists themselves from the blueprints to fulfill neo-
colonialist agenda.
Nigeria's social pluralism is understandably a cog in
terms of modernization, nation building, development, and
governance. Babangida (2002) argued that colonialism and
the political economy of the post-colonial state have engen-
dered several dimensions of "pluralism, complexity and cor-
poratism in the country."According to him, the social classes,
which have accelerated in development since the Nigerian
Civil War in response to public policies on the economy,
have multiplied the segments of social stratification.
Nigeria's nationalists may have recognized the fissiparous
potential early and chose to ignore or banish any political or
economic idea based on these identities by accepting the
national frontiers as outlined by the colonialists. There were
sharp disagreements among the nationalists during various
debates for independence, especially between Sir Ahmadu
Bello and Chief Obafemi Awolowo on issues bordering on
ethnic interest (Aboro, 2005); yet, they carried on with the
project "Nigeria." Even Hugh Clifford (1921), the colonial
Governor who took over from Lord Lugard "the amalgam-
ator" of the southern and northern Protectorates, accepted
that the project was a mistake when he said the amalgama-
tion was like "mixing oil with water" (p. 12). However, the
British colonialists encouraged tribalistic or regional poli-
tics. It is also recognized that regional politics introduced
during the colonial era remains the bane of the modern poli-
tics (Balarabe-Musa, 1996). Therefore, there can be nothing
progressive about such politics as it tends to create in the
political space the divisive, obscurantist, and retrogressive
forces. Most significantly, he declared that the British did
this to ensure that the political hegemony continues to serve
foreign powers, "who keep us [Nigerians] divided so that
they can subjugate us and exploit our human and natural
resources" (Iweriebo, 1996, p. iv).
There are more compelling reasons to indict that the seed
of ethnicity was hatched by the British colonialists. For
instance, that the term minority was practically unknown to
the Nigerian political system (Ekeh, 1996). The term only
gained currency in the tense years between 1952 and 1960
that prepared Nigeria for independence from British imperial
rule. But the majority/minority dichotomy that was to
become the apocalypse in the political system was sown with
the introduction of indirect rule. As the "master principle of
Olaiya 9
governance" in British colonies, the doctrine was actually a
political instrument for organizing power in colonial Nigeria
and served to recognize the cultural distinctions in each kin-
ship grouping. However, the doctrine granted limited politi-
cal space and interaction by restricting administrative actions
within each locality, which explains the lack of inter-ethnic
political interactions among the various ethnic groupings
prior to the 1950s in Nigeria. Apart from intra-ethnic politi-
cal apathy that indirect rule engendered, by dint of one rule
or the other, it imposed restrictions on inter-ethnic relations
even in more severe manner than it obtained prior to coloni-
zation (Ekeh, 1996). Ekeh (1996) noted that
devotion to the theory and practice of Indirect Rule not only
ossified . . . development in Nigeria, it retarded constitutional
growth . . . [This is especially the case with Northern Nigeria
which] continues [to exist] in peaceful isolation from the South,
screened from . . . outside influences by [British] political
officers and the dogma of Indirect Rule. (p. 36)
During the decolonization period of the 1950s, the major-
ity ethnic groups dominated the politics in each of the three
regions, except in the northern region where the dominant
force was actually in firm grip of the minority Fulani (Ekeh,
1996). In the South, demographic advantage worked in favor
of the Yoruba and Igbo to become political power holders
respectively in Western and Eastern Regions, while other
ethnic groupings, including Benin, Ijaw, and Efik, became
minority ethnic groups. In the North, power was comfortably
in the hands of the minority Fulani who exercised dominance
on the Hausa, Nupe, and Ilorin-Yoruba, whom they con-
quered, and on the Tiv and other northern ethnic groups,
"whom the Fulani did not conquered" (p. 37). In the end, the
British imperialists were the gainers while the Nigerians, due
largely to ethnic struggles, were largely uncoordinated and in
fact unaware of the need to be.
In addition, indirect rule created a gulf between the
favored traditional elites, who ruled the people, and the side-
tracked educated elites, in vanguard of the people. Although
it has also been argued that most of these educated elites
themselves, having been schooled abroad demonstrated
more of "external referential framework" and a "compro-
mised and ambivalent psychological and ideological disposi-
tion toward the methods and objectives of the national
liberation struggle" (Iweriebo, 1996, p. xv). Thus, it suffices
to argue that the Nigerian nationalism lacked the pedagogy
and iconography necessary for a nuanced pragmatism and
consummate demand for independence. Nigeria emerged
from British colonial rule with a multiparty system, which
ordinarily should promote democratic governance. However,
apart from the crucial fact that the political parties were not
differentiated or distinguished from each other by any politi-
cal or economic ideology, they were essentially ethnic and
regionally based, and were preoccupied with promoting eth-
nic and regional interests. Two of the largest parties, the
Northern Peoples' Congress (NPC) and the Northern
Elements Progressive Union (NEPU), represented and pur-
sued the interests of the predominantly Muslim Northern
Nigeria. The other leading parties, the National Council of
Nigerian Citizens (NCNC) and the Action Group (AG), were
preoccupied with the interests of the southeast and southwest
where they were, respectively, based. It follows inductively
therefore that the political parties were prone to (and did)
manipulate Nigeria's constitutional set up in their respective
control, to wield the country's national wealth and power in
favor of ethnic and regional advantage and well-being rather
than distributing the nation's power and resources equitably
among its nationality groups. Unfortunately, this issue con-
tinues to dominate Nigerian politics in spite of the formation
of more comprehensive national parties in the late 1970s and
early 1990s. The formation of the self-acclaimed "largest
party in Nigeria" (PDP), among other major parties with
semblances of national outlook, hardly removed the procliv-
ity for ethnic sentiments.
Going by the crop and pedigree of the personalities
involved in the struggle for independence, it is expected that
they recognize "divide-and-rule" tactics of the colonialists to
foster the colonial hegemony yet acquiesced to the pluralism
ego by forming political parties in the wake of independence
along ethnic background. With the formation of these major
parties--NPC for Northern agenda, Action Congress for
Western agenda, and NCNC for Eastern agenda--the seed of
intense ethnic crisis that later culminated in the formation of
armed ethnic militias was sown. To depict more of the lack of
national consciousness in the Nigerian nationalist move-
ment, there was no conscious effort on the part of the move-
ment to entrench it in school curriculum for bottom­up
orientation. For instance, it was only in 1969 in Nigeria,
much after independence, that a "reference was made to
unity, nationalism, patriotism, and the like in any of our
school curriculum" (Fafunwa, 1982, p. 3).
Nationalism colored economic policies in particular ways
(Mkandawire & Soludo, 1999). First, the nation-state was
policy's unit of analysis. As such, the state's preoccupation
was with the perceived welfare of its citizens not with maxi-
mizing some global welfare function. Second, the state
would tend to favor nationals or would try to remedy inher-
ited imbalances in the ownership of property or access to
economic resources. Third, in lieu of an indigenous capitalist
class, the state would assume many entrepreneurial tasks
regardless of its overall ideological position. Much has been
written on the relationship between nationalism, the exigen-
cies of nation building, and policy (Mkandawire & Soludo,
1999). Suffice it to note that nationalist impulses partially
explain the policies that have been identified exclusively
with rent seeking (nationalization, import substitution,
expenditure on education, pan-territorial pricing, etc.). Thus,
nationalism could simultaneously account for some of the
sacrifices and commitment behind successes and some of the
chauvinism and xenophobia behind disasters. Significantly,
10 SAGE Open
nationalism influences the perceptions that policies are exter-
nally imposed or likely to compromise national sovereignty
or unity (Olayode, 2005).
Perhaps Nigerian nationalism as movement for political
emancipation, like her cohorts in Africa, also lacked the nec-
essary identity originality that could galvanize it and translate
to development and curb governance crisis. If we go by Wole
Soyinka's (1977) semiotic nationalism4 on the construction of
Africa and the misgivings he proclaimed in the word "Africa"
as a basis for lack of identity and nay Africa's governance
crisis, then an extrapolation to the Nigerian context would be
apt. Soyinka argued, in a speech delivered at the 1977 Second
World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture
(FESTAC), that the moniker "Africa" lacked the indigenous
materiality, reality, and distinctiveness.Another author argued
that the name is, at best, a "discursive fantasy, an unstable and
ambivalent sign that cannot provide a foundational basis for
an identity, an invention prey to and prime for deconstruc-
tion" (Zeleza, 2006, p. 15). He further posited that Africa
lacked identities, just as it did language, and that most of the
states are European inventions, mutually constitutive existen-
tial and epistemic construction. As inventions, the states are
denaturalized of cultural artifacts and practices and striped of
primordial authenticity and essentialism. In other words,
Africa is as much a superficial entity as it is a construct whose
boundaries--geographical, historical, cultural, and represen-
tational--have shifted according to the prevailing concep-
tions and configurations of colonially created identities and
power, and proto-nationalism that followed it, including pre-
and post-independence pan-Africanism.
The case of Nigeria follows logically. That the name
"Nigeria" was coined by a British journalist (Flora Shaw)
who later became the wife of the first Governor-General of
the country Sir Fredrick Lugard in 1898 (Ajala, 2009) depicts
lack of definite identity. Accordingly, "the name was sug-
gested for the collection of protectorates and colonies around
River Niger" (Ajala, 2009, p. 1). Apart from the claim that
Nigeria is "like mixing oil with water" by one of the authors
and finishers of the amalgamation of Nigeria as a state, there
are indications that the nationalists themselves were well
aware of the identity crisis. For instance, Chief Obafemi
Awolowo argued in 1964, while expounding his thesis on
federalism, that
Nigeria is not a nation. It is a mere geographical expression.
There are no Nigerians in the same sense as there are English,
Welsh, or French. The word "Nigerian" is merely a distinctive
appellation to distinguish those who live within the boundaries of
Nigeria from those who do not. (Quoted in Olayode, 2005, p. 9)
Ethnicity, Nationalism, and Emergence
of Governance Crisis in Nigeria
There is a striking similitude in the emergence of states in
Africa and how lack of national consciousness is a serious
issue afflicting the governance of these states. Almost across
board, the endurance of the nation-state culture as an over-
arching political culture is closely tied to how ethnicity is
produced, transformed, and twisted in response to different
circumstances and situations (Zeleza, 2006). In Ethnicity: An
African Predicament, Francis Deng observed that virtually
all modern African governance crises (and conflicts) have
ethno-regional dimension (Deng, 1997). In contemporary
Africa, the role of ethnicity in political systems received a
knock with the ambition of Western-trained education elite
"proto-nationalist," to accept the frontiers of the emergent
independent African states constructed by colonial rule as
constituting their countries (Crowder, 1976, p. 407). In West
Africa, the "nationalists" identified themselves as Nigerians
rather than Yoruba, Hausa, or Igbo; Gold Coaster rather than
Akan, Ewe, or Guan; Senegalese rather than Wollof; Ivoirians
rather than Baoules (Crowder, 1976, pp. 405-407). However,
the intention of the colonialists was not to eradicate ethnicity
but to stem the expressions of nationalism they produce and
perhaps also to prevent tribal conflicts. Thus, as a creation of
colonial rule ethnicity was partly responsible for sowing the
seeds of democratic and governance misadventures that soon
became rampant in post-colonial Africa. European colonial-
ists set Africans against Africans by hand picking pliable col-
laborators, constituted by the group that Frantz Fanon (1980)
calls the "benis oui oui" or the "yes yes men" (Fanon, 1980,
p. 23). It also facilitated the subjugation of African masses
because ethnic strife provided an excuse for repressive mili-
tary and police actions by colonial authorities--develop-
ments that, in turn, triggered the spate of coup d'état in most
West African states.
Clearly, also, the states so formed, its citizens, officials,
and indeed the political parties, lacked a strong sense of
nationhood that placed them on the threshold of disastrous
collapse at different times (Clifford, 1921). As, from the
foregoing, most post-colonial West African states are not
fashioned as public property but to serve parochial and eth-
nic interest of those who created and control them, confusion
routinely developed between notions of statehood vis-à-vis
nationhood. In Nigeria, key ethnic militia groups Oodua
Peoples'Congress(OPC),theMovementfortheActualization
of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), the Arewa
Boys, the Egbesu Boys, the Movement for the Survival of
Ogoni Peole (MOSOP) successfully defined and controlled
political outcomes in their respective regions, including the
formation and administration of political parties (Ajala,
2009). But, then, ethnicity by itself is not the problem (Ukeje
&Adebanwi, 2006). Instead, the problem of ethnicity derives
from the manner in which it is mobilized by the political
elite. The point had been pursued by noting,
Because access to state power is recognized by most ethnic
groups as a requisite for self and collective motivation,
expression and reproduction, the local elites and ethnic
entrepreneurs within group set the tone and agenda of politics in
Olaiya 11
ways that are parochial, beneficial to themselves principally and
then to the larger group. When the opportunity to access state
power is forestalled, therefore, one of the first defensive
mechanisms that an ethnic group readily mobilizes is that of
collective, non-violent action but it scales up steadily towards
militancy and violence. (pp. 2-4)
Indeed, the Tiv ethnic protest on the eve of Nigerian indepen-
dence (Crowder, 1987) runs deep to indicate that not all eth-
nic groups were carried along in the independence debates. It
could also portend that not all germane issues were exhaus-
tively ironed out during the decolonization process. At the
very time, the Nigerian flag was being hoisted to replace the
Union Jack, a deadly riot was taking place in Tivland. Thus,
even if ethnicity is not a problem of its own, a mishandling
of the mechanics for amalgamation of peoples of disparate
cultures and tempers can only be a time bomb waiting to
explode. It was thus argued that the 1914 amalgamation "was
a token . . . which did not truly bring them [the two regions]
into a meaningful relationship with each other" (p. 18).
Perhaps one area where the lingering effect of this dys-
functional post-colonial development most vividly expresses
itself has been in the formation of political parties along eth-
nic lines, with the bigger and dominant political parties
coming from the largest ethnic groups while smaller ethnic
groups produce weaker political parties. The formation of
ethnically motivated political parties, mostly through the
active connivance of colonial officials, led to the implosion
of political parties with evident lack of internal democratic
culture and values that is at the root of the generic failure of
democracies in the sub-region. In Nigeria, for instance, the
three major political parties formed during the heydays of
independence were along ethno-regional lines: the NPC,
AG, and National Council of Nigerians and the Cameroons
(NCNC) dominated by Hausa/Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo,
respectively. During the Second Republic, the major politi-
cal parties were also formed along ethnic lines with the
National Party of Nigeria (NPN), Peoples' Redemption
Party (PRP), and Great Nigeria Peoples' Party (GNPP) rep-
resenting the North, the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), and
Nigerian People's Party (NPP) representing the South-West
and South-East, respectively. Although the nascent political
culture that is under construction since the return to civilian
rule in 1999 has shown pan-Nigeria tendencies, especially
with membership and the activities of the key political par-
ties (PDP, AC, All Progressives Grand Alliance [APGA],
Progressive Peoples Alliance [PPA]) cutting across tradi-
tional sectional divides, ethnicity continues to show a
remarkable resilience in political discourses and contesta-
tions as the recent hot debate on zoning within the ruling
party, the PDP, shows. The inevitable, even if tentative, con-
clusion is that in spite of recent developments associated
with the transition to multiparty rule in the sub-region, the
old pathologies associated with ethnicity and other sectional
expressions have not receded--in some instances, indeed,
they have witnessed a resurgence in a manner that threatens
political and governance process. There is a considerable
agreement that formation of parties along ethnic lines is
capable of creating "real tension among the ethnic groups
. . . mutual distrust among competing communities . . . and
conflict of interest," which "often escalated into political
violence" (Ajala, 2009, p. 16). The ultimate scenario,
according to him, is that in many instances, the political vio-
lences created in the polity have "led to fundamental shifts
in the Nigerian political system and political instabilities."
Conclusion
Apart from the abuse of all the constitutions (1960, 1963,
1979, and 1999) by the political gladiators and the develop-
ment of "strong men" rather than "strong institutions"
through manipulation of the ballot box or the barrels of the
gun, the expropriation of the resources of the state by the few
and the apparent progressive immiseration of the masses as a
result are the lots of Nigeria in the 50 years as an independent
country. Within these years, Nigeria appropriates a ready
appellation and the signification of a country where there is
little if any hope in all spheres of governance and economic
indicators. Rule of law is practically ostracized, personal and
material security is at low ebb, violent and irrepressible reli-
gious and ethno-nationalist struggles are on the progressive
rise, the economy cannot compete favorably even within the
region, using various economic measurements, despite the
huge petro-dollar revenue accruing since the early 1970s,
and, worst of all, the political environment is antithetical.
Most of the above have been attributed to the plethora of
military rule, invariably staged in the name of cleansing the
state but which left the nation worse-off. Nevertheless, the
respite of brief elective form of government between 1979
and 1983 and the last 10 years have only made a mockery of
the nation's political history, deepening further the much-
publicized lack of prospect for liberal democracy bestowed
by the British colonial masters.
Development economists too have advanced the
resource curse argument and Dutch disease syndrome as
the bane of the country's oil economy that led to a mono-
lithic economy that retarded development and bred corrupt
practices and violent politics. This article debunked each
of the claims in these theses and asserted that the root is
indeed the colonial heritage of disparate nationalities cob-
bled together 50 odd years before and the insular nature of
the nationalist that led to the queer nature of state making
in Nigeria. Given the paucity of attention given to building
national political and economic structure by the colonial
rulers, the agitation for more involvement to participate in
the political governance by the nationalists, which derailed
the conscience of Nigerian nationalism, and the elitist
nature of the decolonization process, which precluded dia-
logue by all stakeholders, the present governance crisis is
not far-fetched.

It was precisely for this reason, as the article argued, that
successive post-colonial administrations, following the
divide-and-rule traditions of the colonial state, have failed to
