Abstract
Full-horizon cylindrical projections of the optic array are in common use. One wonders whether
the public actually profits from such pictorial information, since the space behind one's back does
not exist in visual awareness. In an experiment, a test image included six persons located at the
corners of an irregular hexagon centred at the camera. Two persons faced the camera, two turned
their back to the camera and two others faced a direction at right angles to the camera. The
distances to the camera were unequal and varied from 1 to 2 m. Participants were asked to draw a
ground plan of the perceived configuration, including actors and camera, on the basis of viewing
the picture. As with any picture there exist many possible interpretations, the ambiguity grows
even more when the angular scope of the picture is unknown. Almost all nai
¨ve viewers parse this
planispheric (Mercator) representation so as to have the whole scene in front of them, with the
actors standing in a circle, facing each other. They take the viewpoint to be outside the circle. Only
a few placed the viewpoint inside the circle, which is indeed another reasonable interpretation
(in this case the actual one).

Introduction
Full optic array (Burton, 1945; Gibson, 1950; Koenderink, Albertazzi, et al., 2010; Reid,
1819) panoramic cameras are becoming increasingly available and popular.
Nai¨ve observers have considerable problems to deal with very wide-angle (but less than
180) images (Attneave & Farrar, 1977; Koenderink, van Doorn, de Ridder, & Oomes, 2010;
Phillips & Voshell, 2009).
In the common full-horizon, cylindrical projections (e.g., the popular equirectangular or
equidistant rectangular, French: plate carre´e, German: quadratische Plattkarte; Snyder, 1993)
observers routinely ignore the periodic structure (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2017). This
happens even when interactive panning is available. In popular `rolling ball' dynamic,
interactive renderings one routinely confuses the interior and exterior orientations
(Koenderink & van Doorn, in press). The problems are due to a lack of intuitive grasp of
the topology, the fact that the horizon is a closed curve and that the viewing sphere is viewed
from the inside, whereas rolling ball graphics show the outside.
One might say that the full horizon is a `magic circle' that ­ in depictions ­ cannot be
entered by the observer (Buckland, 2002). Something similar applies to the full viewing
sphere. In this contribution we explore that notion in more ­ also quantitative ­ detail.
In this article, the emphasis is on static images of the familiar `postcard' variety, that is,
roughly A5-size viewed informally at normal reading distance. The most popular static
representations are cylindrical projections with the horizon represented as a (straight)
horizontal line. Various cylindrical projections, in which the verticals are rendered as
vertical straight lines, are in common use. In this experiment the Mercator representation,
a planispheric, conformal map is used (Mercator, 1569). Its conformal property is nice whereas
global deformations are limited if the elevations are not too close to either zenith or nadir.1
Such a cylindrical full-horizon rendering yields a rectangular picture. Its aspect ratio
depends on the range of elevations. So we skip two `polar-caps' centred at zenith and
nadir. In practice, we decided on a desired aspect ratio (postcard format) and let that
constrain the extreme elevations. At first blush such a picture appears as a regular postcard.
In previous experiments (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2017, in press) we showed that human
visual awareness is simply unable to deal with such renderings. In these experiments we tried
hard to make the visual task as simple as possible for the observers. In contradistinction, in
the present experiment we intentionally set up a spatial configuration in such a way as to
`fool' the observer: By having the pictorial content conform to a familiar scene we enforce the
`generic postcard' situational awareness and thus silently suggest an inappropriate scope. It is
indeed not hard to design spatial configurations that will almost certainly be perceived in
some specific manner by the overwhelming majority of nai¨ve observers. This is just intuition;
there is no science of the matter. This ability might well find applications in ­ for instance ­
the movie business.
Well-documented misinterpretations (Koenderink, van Doorn et al., 2010; Koenderink &
van Doorn, 2017) are due to the fact that a postcard type of image is routinely interpreted as
the rendering of a `normal' field of view, roughly spanning 40 to 80. In the case of regular
photographs the actual field of view may range from a few degrees (`tele' shots) up to 150
(extreme `wide-angle') view. Observers typically do not know the actual field of view and
interpret any image in terms of their implicit `normal' view (Koenderink, van Doorn et al.,
2010), sometimes leading to apparent `deformations' seen in perfect perspective renderings
(Brandt, 1961).
In the case of extremely panoramic (horizontal field of view exceeding 180) images there is
an additional complication in that they contain content that would be behind the observer's
2 i-Perception 9(3)
back. In generic visual awareness the space behind the back does not exist in a visual sense
(Phillips & Voshell, 2009). We have already shown that this yields completely novel types of
characteristic errors in pictorial perception (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2017) that go beyond
the usual `Ames room-type' (Ittleson, 1952) effects.
The effects can often be predicted at least semiquantitatively from simple models of the
structure of visual space, as we have shown for extreme wide-angle views (Koenderink, van
Doorn et al., 2010). To extend this to cases that include the space behind the back is such an
extreme extrapolation as to be a shot in the dark. As we show here, it actually works quite
well. Since most readers will be unfamiliar with the log-polar visual space model (Koenderink
& van Doorn, 2008), we succinctly summarise the basics in the following.
Methods
The aim was to design a spatial configuration in such a way that nai¨ve observers would be
grossly deceived in their `reading' of the picture. We aim at categorical mistakes, rather than
mere (even if large) quantitative errors. The aim was to produce a planispherical map that
could readily be confused with a regular photograph showing a `normal' scope of 40 to 80
instead of the full 360.
Design of the Configuration
One would like to apply the Ames room technique (Ittleson, 1952) to create optically
equivalent configurations. However, in the case of full-horizon renderings this is evidently
not possible, because the Ames room technique conserves the identity of `visual rays' and
merely shifts positions on these rays. For the present application one also needs to change the
visual directions. This can be done using a general model of visual space (Koenderink & van
Doorn, 2008).
We have shown the power of this model for the case of extreme wide-angle (e.g., fish-eye lens)
views (Koenderink, van Doorn et al., 2010; Koenderink & van Doorn, 2017). Effects are huge,
observers committing misjudgements of the spatial attitude of pictorial objects exceeding 100.
(Perhaps surprisingly, the misjudgements are as extreme as that, although the textbooks do not
mention them.) This still applies to the space in front of the camera though.
Here we go categorically beyond that, including the space `behind the camera'. There exist
no observations on such cases, so we are in no position to predict how this will work out.
The difference is indeed categorical because human observers are physiologically limited to
the optical space in front of them (Helmholtz, 1896). Going beyond that even introduces
changes of a topological nature, so all bets are off. We aim at a design that might be
interpreted in two, mutually very different, ways: In one interpretation, the camera is at
the centre of a group of people and in the other interpretation, the camera is outside the
group. The mutual spatial attitudes in the two interpretations are also very different. Here is
the design:
Consider a group of six persons facing each other, positioned on the vertices of a regular
hexagon. In the case of a `normal' photograph, the camera will be outside the hexagon.
Usually, the distance of the camera to the group will be large with respect to the diameter
of the hexagon, on an axis of bilateral symmetry, with three persons on each side of the main
camera direction. Then, two persons will roughly face the camera, two will turn their back to
the camera and two will be seen in profile, facing the camera axis. The persons facing the
camera will be at the largest, those turning their backs to the camera at the shortest and those
seen in profile at some intermediate distance from the camera.
Koenderink et al. 3
For a full 360 panoramic view, one obtains a configuration in the ground plan shown in
Figure 1 left. (Figure 1 right shows two areas defined by the points of the hexagonal
configuration that will be discussed later in the article.) We picked a minimum distance of
1 m in order to obtain an angular height of about 60, roughly equal to the spacing along the
horizon. In Mercator projection, this will then yield a reasonable (postcard variety) aspect
ratio.
In Figure 2 we show a simulation on a regular tiled floor with square tilings in Mercator
projection, thus fully exhibiting the actual layout. Yet, what we see (as colleagues that were
shown the image) is a group of actors arranged in a circle, facing each other. This suggests
that observers are generally unable to make good use of such images, even if they know what
they are looking at. We already know that from experience with full-horizon images in
various settings (urban scenes, natural landscapes and indoor scenes). Given the growing
use of full-horizon images, it is important to gain some notion as to the degree of veridicality
of their immediate impressions.
In this report we test an actual image on a large number of observers. This allows us to
arrive at expectations of the kind of configuration observers are likely to report. Such
expectations depend on two generic principles, namely: firstly, the spatial attitude of visual
Figure 1. Left: Ground plan for the photograph used in the experiment. The camera is at the central orange
disk. Notice that the actors are at distances of either 1 m, 141 cm (

m) or 2 m from the camera, in
directions at 60 intervals. The formal `frontal' direction has been added for easy reference. Right: Here the
camera position is the white point, the points of the hexagonal configuration are indicated with the brown
points. The boundary of the orange region is an ellipse passing through the points, the boundary of the blue
region (to be discussed in detail later) also passes through the points. The camera is inside the orange region,
but outside the blue region. This is the topological relation that we are addressing in this study. The two
regions are related through a remapping of visual directions, they are optically fully equivalent interpretations.
Either region is an okay interpretation of the picture.

objects is judged with respect to the local line of sight, and secondly, depicted scenes are taken
to be located in a half-space in front of the viewpoint. The scene designed here can be
interpreted in an infinity of ways, although two might be termed `cardinal'. In a later
section these cardinal views are compared in some detail. In the experiment we attempt to
quantify the probability of obtaining one or the other cardinal view. As argued earlier, we
expressly set up the scene to suggest one of these. The depiction of the full-horizon scene is
typical for the images that are already widely used by the general public.
The configuration was set out in the Leuven city park. The locations of the actors were
previously constructed with the help of a measuring tape and indicated by hammering tent
pegs in the ground.
In Figure 3, it is shown what was in front and what at the back of the camera. Here the
`frontal direction' has only a formal meaning (indicated in Figure 1 left), since the camera
itself has no preferred `viewing direction' but is fully isotropic. The stereographic projections
each show a full half-space. Notice that their (circular) outlines coincide.
The photograph destined to be used as the stimulus was taken with a Ricoh Theta S
panoramic camera from roughly average navel or breast-height. Thus the horizon will
roughly bisect the vertical extent of the figures, which is desirable in order to balance the
magnification increase with visual height of the Mercator projection.
The camera was remote controlled by means of an iPhone, so the photographer does not
appear in the photograph. The Mercator map (see Figure 4) was computed by way of a
simple program written in Processing 3. It can hardly be distinguished from the raw camera
image (an equirectangular map).
Figure 2. An artificial scene. The `actors' (mutually identical Daruma dolls) are placed on an infinite floor
with regular square tiling. By noticing the vanishing points of the grout lines at the horizon, you easily figure
out the extent of the field of view. By following the curved grout lines (which are actually straight lines), you
may figure out the actual orientation of the figures with respect to each other. One should be able to work
out the actual layout, all the necessary cues are explicitly present. Few observers can do this a prima vista
though.

Definition of coordinates and angles. The geometry of the experiment is sufficiently complex that
it may be confusing for most, thus we clarify some definitions. The reader is invited to use
Figure 5 as a reference.
The figure at top left shows the definition of the azimuth, the figure at top right shows an
idealised response in which the azimuths and distance ratios are veridical and the figure at
bottom shows the definition of the gaze angles. In the figure at top right we also indicate
indices for the locations, which often come in handy in discussion.
Just for exercise, in the figure at top left, the gaze angles for Indexes 1 to 6 are
0, þ90, Æ180, Æ180, À90 and 0. Of course, the angles Æ180 are equivalent.
Design of the Experiment
In the final experiment, observers were handed a piece of A4 paper (see Figure 6) in portrait
orientation with the Mercator map as shown in Figure 4 printed in the upper half. They could
fill in their personal data (name, age, gender and date) on a line at top. The lower half had an
outlined, square, empty area with the instructions in the right margin. No further instruction
was provided.
All analysis was done on the basis of the drawings, a typical one being shown in the
drawing area of Figure 6. These drawings were digitised by hand using a program
specially written for the occasion. The centres of gravity of the person marks and the
camera marks were judged by eye.
Observers
Observers were students and staff at the institutes of experimental psychology of
the universities of Leuven and Giessen. Median age was 32 and interquartile range was

experiment, 24 from Leuven and 37 from Giessen.
Observations
Participants had no conceptual problems with the task. As expected, no one asked what the
field of view was. (If anyone had done so we would have offered that information.) Problems
that occasionally occurred were due to the familiar fact that people often underestimate the
final size of their drawing, thus finding themselves short of free space at some phase in the
process. When the camera was drawn outside the frame, this was considered acceptable.
In cases where they inquired in retrospect whether they were `right', they often had trouble
to make sense of the physical ground plan and to relate it to the picture. Even after `knowing
the solution', no one could intuitively `see' it. Quite a few even failed to understand the
`solution' at all. This lack of ability to `see' the actual configuration also holds true for the
authors: Although we obviously know exactly what the actual scene was like, we can only
relate that to the picture in reflective thought, using geometrical and logical reasoning, we
cannot spontaneously see it. In that respect it is similar to the classical geometrical illusions,
where knowing the actual geometry does in no way help to get rid of the illusion.
Figure 4. The photograph used as stimulus in the experiment. The ground plan of the physical configuration
is shown in Figure 1 left. The projection is Mercator, with the horizon at the half-height of the picture. Notice
that the actors are equally spaced on the horizon. The pictorial vertical extent of the actors varies by about a
factor of two (the persons were not of exactly the same size). The actors are seen in either anterior,
posterior or lateral (profile) view. The location of the feet is another cue to distance: since the terrain was
roughly horizontal, higher in the picture plane indicates greater distance from the camera. The picture has a
periodic topology in the sense that the left and right edges show the same direction of view (purely
posterior). Zenith and nadir are at Æ1, upwards and downwards in the picture plane, they have been
arbitrarily cropped. The horizon roughly cuts the actors in half, thus indicating the height of the camera.

The drawings were digitised into ordered lists of Cartesian coordinate pairs. All
subsequent analysis was done on these data.2
Analysis
Various types of analysis can be done on this data. However, we are careful not to
overanalyse the data in view of the fact that participants delivered quick sloppy drawings
and did not use any drawing or measuring instruments.
Initial Categorical Checks
At an initial stage we removed four items from the list because obviously they were
incoherent. In one case this was known to be due to language problems. Formal reasons
were such factors as, for instance, a number of actors different from six, cases of all actors
facing the camera, evidently in conflict with the pictorial content, or extreme long time to
reflect on the response. This left 57 cases.
In 55 out of 57 cases (96.5%), the camera was located outside the convex hull of the actor
locations. With a Bayes factor of 9.5 we have `substantial' evidence (using Jeffreys prior and
scale) for the fact that the observers located the camera at some distance in front of the group.
Another coarse check involves the nose directions. In 50 out of 57 cases (88%), all noses
pointed into the interior of the convex hull. With a Bayes factor of 8.9 we have again
`substantial' evidence for the fact that all observers faced into the interior.

angles being counted in the clockwise direction (in this figure, all ranges have been set to the same value).

we show two example poses, one for negative and one for positive gaze angle.

`response'. (All responses made available as a movie on the publisher's website). Notice that the method is
self-documenting.
Koenderink et al. 9
Parameter Estimates
A very simple starting point is an overall average. First we computed the mean and
covariance matrix for the six actor locations. The drawing was then translated, rotated
and scaled to place the mean at the origin, the orientation of the largest variance
horizontal, with the largest variance equal to 1. This brings all results into a common
format. This is a necessary stage because observers used different placements, orientations
and sizes in their drawings.
We then averaged over the full group, using circular statistics for the nose directions. In
Figure 7 we show the result. The ellipses for the locations and sectors for the directions have
been drawn at one standard deviation.
The result is encouraging, for it shows that the normalised data is quite homogeneous.
This result is perhaps even better than expected.
The apparent scope. One simple measure is the apparent angular scope of the configuration as
subtended by the group seen from the camera location. The median is 104, with an
interquartile interval of 89 to 119. The histogram is shown in Figure 8.
With a median wider than a right angle, the scopes are quite wide. However, it is evident
that the scope is certainly less than 180. Thus, virtually all participants saw the picture as
pictorial content `in front of them' or perhaps `behind the picture plane'. This is a major
qualitative result.
Aspect ratio. For this initial pass through the data we defined the `aspect ratio' as the square
root of the ratio of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the positions in the normalised
data. The eigenvectors are almost all (exceptions noted later) in the anterior­posterior and
left­right orientations, so this is a reasonable estimate in most cases.
The majority of the configurations have an aspect ratio quite different from 1. In all cases,
the elongated hexagon is oriented with its major axis at right angles to the principal direction

of view (see Figure 7). The configurations are extended in the lateral orientation or ­
equivalently ­ flattened in the (frontal) depth direction.
The median aspect ratio is 0.46 and the interquartile range is 0.34 to 0.59. In Figure 9 we
show a histogram of the distribution. (In the discussion we have occasion to address the
aspect ratios from another perspective.)
Depth ratios. The range ratios (camera to actors) are either 1,
ffiffiffi
2
p
% 1:4 or 2. The depth ratios
can easily be obtained from the observed geometry. Since the depth ratios can easily be
estimated from the relative sizes of the actors in the stimulus, one perhaps expects to find
them reflected in the results. In Figure 10 we show distribution data.
The unit range ratios are fd1=d6
, d2=d5
, d3=d4g (indices defined in Figure 5) as well as their
reciprocals. Thus the median is not too interesting, only the spread is. The interquartile range
is 0.927 to 1.08, which may be partly due to the fact that the actors were not identical in
height.
For the range ratios 2 we use fd3=d1
, d4=d6g. The median is 1.76 and the interquartile range
is 1.42 to 2.07, so these depth ratios are about 10% less than veridical.

Figure 8. Histogram of the apparent scope.
Koenderink et al. 11
The range ratios square root of 2 show a bimodal distribution. Here we need to distinguish
between the near and the far range. In the near range we consider the ratios fd2=d1
, d5=d6g and
in the far range, fd3=d2
, d4=d5g. In the near range, the median ratio is 1.77 and the
interquartile range is 1.609 to 1.96, and in the far range, the median ratio is 0.983 and the
interquartile range is 0.852 to 1.09. So, the near and far ranges are indeed very different and
both far from veridical, though in different directions.
Thus the results for the
ffiffiffi
2
p
range ratios are somewhat puzzling. After all, the veridical
values are simply implied by a ratio of two linear stretches in the picture plane. Participants
apparently do not use the optical size­distance relation to their best advantage, whereas it
would be natural for them to assume that the actors were of (very roughly) similar height.
Apparent azimuths. The azimuths at which the camera sees the actors are spaced
at 60 intervals. This is reflected by a uniform spacing in the Mercator projection,
even in the case of the left-most and right-most actors if one remembers the periodic
topology of the horizon. One might expect the observers to space the apparent azimuths
equally since they are fully displayed in the picture plane. This turns out to be hardly the case
though.
Figure 11 shows a plot of the observed azimuths against the veridical ones. Apparently,
the observed azimuths of the outermost actors are highly compressed. This is already evident
from the average plot (Figure 7).
Nose directions. The veridical nose directions have been listed earlier, they are:

The deviations (median observed nose direction minus the veridical direction) have been
plotted against azimuth in Figure 12. (The figure also shows the interquartile ranges.) Clearly,
the observations differ appreciably from veridical.
Discussion
First some special cases are discussed and a discussion on generic results follows. Although
the special cases get some attention here, one should not forget that the bulk of the data is
best represented by the averages shown in Figure 7. The special cases form only a small
minority. That is not to say they are not of major interest though. Of the two interpretations
suggested in Figure 1 right (a fuller discussion follows later) one has the viewpoint interior to
the circle of actors and the other exterior to that circle. (Read `in the round', or something
like that for `circle' here, we obviously do not intend a perfect geometrical circle.) Both are
quite reasonable interpretations. Whereas it is indeed very interesting to note that the large
majority voted `exterior', it is highly relevant that some voted `interior': It shows that
participants have a choice.3 A formal analysis also reveals two categorically different but

dots are medians, the interquartile range is also indicated, though hardly apparent.

optically equivalent (Ittleson, 1952) interpretations. Thus, it is a notable fact that generic
observers have a very pronounced preference for one of these.
Inside the Magic Circle
There were two observers who entered the magic circle (see Figure 13). These are mutually
very different cases.
In the case of Observer 44 we see a standard configuration except for the location of the
camera. Here the view is from outside the magic circle, whereas the camera has been placed
inside. Of course, this latter placement is fully inconsistent with the configuration. The fact
that two actors evidently had their back turned towards the camera is completely ignored.
This drawing is possibly a mixture of what the observer actually saw and some aspect of what
the observer knew about 360 cameras but could not integrate with the percept.
The case of Observer 51 is more interesting. This was in fact the only observer that entered
the magic circle in a qualitatively consistent manner, the inconsistencies (which are not at all
minor) being of a quantitative nature. This observer marked the actors both in the stimulus
and in the drawing, so we can be certain that the two noses pointing outwards belong to the
actors seen from the dorsal side and that the noses pointing at right angles to the visual
direction belong to the actors seen in profile. The responses are indeed quite consistent,
except for the fact that the distance ratios have been fully ignored. Apparently the urge to
see a `circle' was much stronger than the additional visual evidence.
There was actually another observer among the ones left out from the data set who started
with drawing a circle, putting the camera at the centre, the actors in a regular hexagon ­ fully
ignoring angular size and horizon dip cues. The observer then rounded this off by putting the
nose directions as would fit a view from far out of the magic circle. In this case the drawing
was evidently made on the basis of guesses in reflective thought as was also evident from the
time taken to reflect (the reason for the decision to ignore this response).

indicated by the white dots with thick black line elements. The cross denotes the origin of the (normalised)
coordinates. The black dot indicates the camera location.
14 i-Perception 9(3)
Convexity
There are three nonconvex responses, two of these trivial, because of minor sloppiness in
drawing, the remaining one is interesting and merits mention (Figure 14).
The configuration is evidently nonconvex and the scope is unusually large, about 180.
This is the only observer that noticed the huge scope, although still not entering the magic
circle. The response shows the observer to notice the nose direction with respect to the visual
direction, no other observer did that. Also the depth ratios are reasonably well reflected in the
response (compare Figure 10). All in all, this observer picked up more cues than almost
anyone else. The response is close to possible interpretations that include `the space behind
the back' (see later).
We do not discuss the convexity issue further at this point, since it will be more fully
treated in terms of the log-polar model introduced later. (A configuration that is nonconvex
in physical space may well be convex in visual space.)
The Overall Qualitative Outcome
The major result of the experiment is neatly summarised in the average results depicted in
Figure 7. Apparently the actors are perceived as arranged in a slightly flattened hexagon, its
long axis perpendicular to the principal direction of view (defined in Figure 7). The camera is
located outside the hexagon. All nose directions point into the interior of the hexagon. Thus
the experience is of the magic circle as seen from the outside.
Such a result is not unexpected (Koenderink & van Doorn, 2017, in press). The impression
cannot even be said to be `non-veridical' in the sense that the picture itself is not a touchstone
for veridicality. The result is due to these major factors:
 observers implicitly assume some finite scope, in many cases related to the extent of their
apparent field of view (Koenderink, van Doorn, & Todd 2009). The latter is almost
invariably smaller (usually much smaller) than a half-space;
 observers relate the apparent spatial attitude of pictorial objects to their local (apparent)
visual directions (Koenderink, van Doorn et al., 2010);

 observers tend to apply templates in favor of `inverse optics' algorithms (Koenderink,
2011).
The same factors give rise to huge errors in regular wide-angle photographs, as we have
documented in the past (Koenderink, van Doorn et al., 2010).
Next we discuss these issues in more detail in terms of the log-polar model of visual space
(Koenderink & van Doorn, 2008).
Discussion of Selected Quantitative Details
In this subsection we discuss a number of remarkable regularities in the data.
Azimuth pattern. One pictorial structure that might be thought to be obvious to all observers
because immediately visually present is the pattern of azimuths. Even without fully parsing
the stimulus the regular spacing of the major pictorial objects (the actors) is evident. One
might expect that basic fact to be reflected in the responses. Perhaps remarkably, it is not, as
is evident from Figure 11.
This might suggest that observers generally put the camera too close to the hexagonal
configuration. This is indeed in accord with the generally wider than expected scopes.
One may speculate that it perhaps has to do with the limited drawing area. Of course, there
is no way to check for that in the data, it would imply another (major) effort to address the
issue empirically.
Depth ratios. The distributions of depth ratios as plotted in Figure 10 gives rise to some
concern.
The depth ratios 1 are responded to veridically, with little spread. This is no more than
expected. The depth ratios 2 are underestimated, although only by about 10%, also, not
much reason for concern. Their spread is large.
The depth ratios
ffiffiffi

p
are wildly off the mark though. Moreover, the distributions are
markedly bimodal with the ratios in the near ranges being treated quite differently from
those in the far range. Those in the near range are overestimated by about 30%, whereas
those in the far range are underestimated by about the same amount. In the far case the
spread is moderate, in the near case rather larger.
Such effects are surprising in view of the clear pictorial cues. As seen in Figure 15 the
pictorial evidence leaves little doubt as to the depth ratios. Observers are expected to use such
cues fully automatically. There is something going on here that is hard to put the finger on, at
least on the basis of the present data. Again, it would imply another (major) effort to address
the issue empirically.
Aspect ratios and scopes. The cases of the aspect ratios and the scopes are discussed together
since they appear mutually related.
The apparent scopes appear rather larger than expected. The median corresponds to a
focal length of about 14 mm on a 35-mm camera (the classical 24 Â 36 mm Leica format),
generally considered a fairly wide wide-angle (the shortest lens for the Leica is the 12 mm
Heliar produced by Voigtlander). Of course, it is still fully located in the frontal half-space of
the (imagined) camera.
From an earlier investigation (Koenderink et al., 2009) we know that the median `apparent
field of view' (perhaps the `diameter of the visual field') is about a right angle (as Helmholtz
reports for his own subjective feeling) with a very wide distribution from about 10 to
16 i-Perception 9(3)
over 210. In the latter case, people feel to `see behind their ears', in the former, they feel
`everything to be in front' of them.
The fact that people are not comfortable with a limited drawing surface may have played a
role, in that they perhaps place the camera closer to the configuration than they would have if
given more drawing space. (Of course, being confronted with an essentially unlimited surface
might intimidate them even more, there is no obvious way to handle such inhibitions.) One
can only speculate.
Here we reconsider the issue of aspect ratios. In Figure 9 we measured aspect ratios in the
drawing. It is probably more useful to consider these in the log-polar representation (see next
section). So we compute `aspect ratio' as measured in log-polar visual space. These aspect
ratios also have a large spread, in this case with an interquartile range of almost 0.3 to 0.5. On
theoretical grounds one expects a relation between the scope and the aspect ratio (see next
section). This can be tested via a scatterplot involving all cases (Figure 16). This graph should
be interpreted in terms of the log-polar model introduced later.
Apparent spatial attitudes. The nose directions with respect to the local camera-viewing-
direction are immediately given as pictorial evidence. Actors are clearly seen either in
anterior or posterior frontal attitude, or in left or right profile.
However, observers apparently distinguish between various directional frames. In this case
they show systematic deviations from what appears to be pictorially given, as documented in
Figure 12.
We believe such systematic effects to be due to the same factors we have studied in some detail
earlier (Koenderink, van Doorn et al., 2010), so it may be said that they meet our expectations.
Figure 15. These are cutouts from an equirectangular map, thus the vertical dimension is simply the
elevation ". For practical purposes, the height ratios in the Mercator projection are quit close. It is evident
that we have ratios 1, 1.4 and 2.
Koenderink et al. 17
The Log-Polar Model of Visual Space
For simplicity we only consider the horizontal plane at eye-height, thus, if we say `visual
space' (usually a hemisphere augmented with depth), we limit the discussion to the horizon
augmented with depth. What is `optically specified' are just visual directions, the depths are
added in the psychogenesis of visual awareness.
In a model of visual space, one has to address the issue of depth values. The best known
example is `inverted optics': one simply computes the depths from the optical data (Marr,
1982; Poggio, Torre, & Koch, 1985), if this does not work one guesstimates them (Knill &
Richards, 1996). This appears reasonable enough, but what if none of this works to
satisfaction? Is it possible to say something about the structure of visual space anyway?
Here is a kind of poor man's inference, based on Euclid's Optics (Burton, 1945):
 in the absence of specific knowledge, all visual directions are equivalent, none is preferred.
Hence the structure of visual space should be invariant with respect to angular translations
(rotations about the nadir-zenith axis).
 in the absence of specific knowledge, there is no preferred `unit of distance'. Hence the
structure of visual space should be invariant with respect to distance scalings (dilations or
contractions about the view point).
These very basic invariances imply a minimal structure of visual space. It can
be formalised in various ways. A very simple formalisation is the log-polar model (see
Figure 17).
Use azimuth ' (angle from the anterior direction, ranging from À (or À180) to þ (or
þ180)) and the logarithm of the distance from the origin  ¼ log % (% the distance from the
origin in an arbitrary unit) as Cartesian coordinates. Thus  ranges from À1 (where
the eye is) to þ1 (the far distance). The invariances imply that arbitrary translations in
the '­coordinate system are irrelevant.
This model has many nice properties, for instance, it is conformal, thus has no
deformations of local details.
Figure 16. Scatterplot of the aspect ratios against the scopes (red points). The curve is the theoretical
prediction, the points are aspect ratios as measured in the log-polar visual space model. Although the spread
is large, as was to be expected, the prediction is evidently in the right ballpark. (Two cases of interior views
left out.)
18 i-Perception 9(3)
Figure 17. The `log-polar' model of visual space. At left, a polar coordinate system in the Euclidean plane.
The system of `rays' is obviously invariant with respect to rotations about the origin. The radii of the system
of circles concentric with the origin have been distributed such that the system is invariant with respect to
uniform scalings about the origin. Thus, the whole system is invariant with respect to rotations and scalings.
This models the structure of optical information as discussed by Euclid in his book on optics. At right, this
configuration has been transformed by the log-polar map. One obtains a Cartesian grid, small regions of the
grid are geometrically similar to the corresponding region in physical space. The map is conformal. Arbitrary
translations of figures in log-polar space derive from optically equivalent figures in physical space. This model
has been shown to account quite well for observer responses with very wide fields of view.
Figure 18. The configuration shown in Figure 1 right plotted in visual space according to the log-polar
model. Now the strange blue banana shape is a perfect ellipse, whereas the orange ellipse is the orange area
which extents all the way to À1. It is also closed (although it may not look that way), because the left and
right edges of the plot are actually the same visual ray, in the posterior direction.
Koenderink et al. 19
As a first application we plot the map of the two regions plotted in Figure 1 right in visual
space (see Figure 18). Now it is immediately obvious why the strange blue banana shaped
region in Figure 1 is of interest: It is the unique ellipse that passes through the points of the
stimulus hexagon in visual space. It is perhaps more difficult to see that the orange region is
bounded by a closed curve too, but notice that the left and right vertical boundaries are
actually the same visual direction. Remember that `the eye' is at f0, À1g. In the log-polar
model the eye is outside the plane, because the eye cannot see itself. It is of considerable
interest to compare the complementary depictions of the same areas in Figures 1 right
and 18.4
Starting from this model picture, we may attempt a bold extrapolation: What if we scale
the azimuth?
Scalings of the depth dimensions are reasonably well understood. We have worked
on that for many years. Scalings of the azimuth dimension have ­ to the best of our
knowledge ­ not been considered before, except in the (very special and limited) case
of linear perspective (Pirenne, 1971). Scalings of the azimuth dimension are of
immediate importance in the perception of photographs for which the scope is essentially
unknown.
Simply scaling scope we obtain the interpretations shown in Figure 19. Of course, the
crucial application is to scale from the space behind your back (or, equivalently, in front of
Figure 19. Here are examples of equivalent configurations in physical space (left) and visual space (right).
Left: The configuration at top left corresponds to the `true sized' configuration in physical space (Figure 1
right). The other three cases involve scalings of the scope, by factors of 2, 4 and 8. Notice that for the factor
4, the shape is `almost' convex, the change to convex happens at a factor of

For larger factors, the banana-shape gives rise to an ovoi
¨dal convex region as in the case at bottom right. In
these figures, the eye is indicated with the open dot. Right: The same four configurations in log-polar space.
These are all perfect ellipses, they have been scaled in scope, that is the horizontal dimension, and the vertical
dimension is the same for all. Thus, this is a anisotropic scaling in visual space. In these figures, the eye is at
f0, À1g (far down the page!). The scaling allows a configuration that extends behind the observer (left figure
at top-left), to be confined to the frontal region (the other three figures at left). Such scalings of the apparent
scope appear quite natural when observers are not aware of the true scope of a picture.

the picture place) to the space in front of you (or, equivalently, behind the picture place).
Here it is already quite clear from all kinds of data that visually, there is no space behind your
back and that it is in bad taste, and almost impossible to pull off, to show objects in front of the
picture plane.5
Thus it is extremely interesting to notice that the (trivially simple) log-polar model does
quite a good job to post-dict the present data. The exterior view model fits the data quite well.
In the aspect ratio plot (Figure 16), the aspect ratios (square root of ratio of eigenvalues of
the covariance matrix of the locations in visual space) are evidently well fitted. Thus one may
actually extrapolate from azimuths behind the camera to azimuths in front of the viewer (or
behind the picture plane), as demonstrated in Figure 19. (The corresponding figures for the
categorically different case of Observer 17 are Figure 1-right (physical space) and Figure 18
(visual space), the bluish-tinted cases.)
In visual space (Figure 19 right) the scaling transforms an ellipse into another ellipse, thus
the plot of Figure 16, where the aspect ratios have been measured in visual space is very
`natural'. The definition of `aspect ratio' in physical space (although formally fine) seems
more contrived.
In the past we have already shown that pictorial space allows for huge (anisotropic)
scalings in the  ¼ log %­domain (Koenderink, van Doorn, & Kappers, 1994). Apparently
any anisotropic scaling with principal axes along the '­dimensions can be admitted. That
such an anisotropic scaling works so well is not something that could have been expected, it is
a major result that significantly extends our previous conclusions.
We know of no other data addressing this issue. It is evidently of great interest to attempt
to collect more though.

Conclusions
Participants were confronted with a postcard-like photograph, obviously of a natural scene,
without any information concerning the scope of the field of view captured by the camera.
This was intentional as it is closest to generic applications. Almost no newspaper, magazine
or textbook prints the width of the field of view in the legends (often there is no legend to
begin with).
Although an obvious fact, almost irrelevant to relate, this goes squarely against the grain of
conventional understanding of correct depiction. The conventional theory of correct depiction

circumference represents the zenith, a single point. This map is neither conformal nor area true. It is quite
nice near the origin (the nadir) though, essentially up to the horizon. Distances from the nadir and angles at
the nadir are perfectly represented. Notice that the tripod on which the camera was mounted is visible at the
centre. The camera cannot see itself. It takes two 190 back-to-back fish-eye photographs and stitches these
together in the camera. The output is an equirectangular representation of the full optic array.

is solidly based on linear perspective or, more generally, on the conservation of angular
relations between visual directions (Pirenne, 1971). On the one hand, it is generally (but
silently!) understood that pictures will `work', no matter what, on the other hand, it is a
universally agreed fact that visual directions should be conserved. There is obviously some
uneasiness here, in that many `wrong' depictions often still give rise to `normal' impressions.
To look `wrong', one typically needs to violate topological relations, as pioneered by artists
like Picasso in the early 20th century (Berger, 1989).
The familiar Ames room (Ittleson, 1952) still manages to induce wonder, yet it works
because it conserves visual directions. Ames demonstrated this loud and clear, although the
significance of his message tends to be underestimated. He demonstrated that pictures are
infinitely ambiguous, something that few scientists are ready to hear even today. For instance,
it implies that `inverse optics' per se is impossible. But in viewing and (hopefully)
understanding pictures, the public routinely goes way beyond Ames. The Ames
demonstration is trivial, but, because of that, important.
The really interesting cases involve deformations of the bundle of visual rays (Burton,
1945).
In this study we move away from the Ames case in that we do not conserve visual
directions. It is perhaps of some interest though, because it involves the space behind the
back, or in front of the picture plane. Our empirical results at least suggest that a fairly simple
model suffices to get at least the basics right. Why such a simple model would work is
something we are not ready to comment on. We are not aware of any argument from
contemporary brain science that might conceivably illuminate this matter.
An interesting aside is that people who are (or have been made) intellectually aware of the
actual physical layout of the scene are generally (we met no exceptions) still unable to `see'
this in terms of their visual awareness. A different approach would have been to tell the
participants up front what they will be confronted with. Perhaps, it would not be too hard to
instruct participants so as to arrive at veridical judgements through a mixture of geometrical
and logical reasoning. It does not work anyway. Even when people know what is there, they
stubbornly see what they see at first blush. Awareness is not a cognitive judgement. Visual
artists trust their eyes, ignoring their reflective thoughts.
Why the difficulties? We speculate that this has to do with the fact that there is no visual
space behind one's back (Phillips & Voshell, 2009). As a consequence, pictures are intuitively
understood to only show part of what could be in front of one. Closely related to this is that
the two actors seen in profile in the stimulus are adjacent to each other in the physical scene
(see Figure 20, compare Figure 1), yet look to be at maximum separation in the picture. The
shortest connection between them would have to cross the posterior meridian of the optic
array, an area behind one's back. In the picture, this connection would have to go by way of
the left and right edges of the picture, which actually should be identified, again something
that is not possible if everything is experienced as in front of the observer (Koenderink & van
Doorn, 2017).
An actual picture of everything in front of the observer only shows part of the
configuration (Figure 3). The depicted part is seen as essentially veridical.
A more or less veridical view of the whole scene can perhaps only (we are not aware of
alternatives) be pictured in a bird eye's view of the scene (Figure 21). This is a Riemann
normal coordinates map (also known as Postel's projection (Flocon & Barre, 1968)) centred
at the nadir. In this map, the full circular picture frame represents the zenith, that is a single
point, thus may have some counterintuitive properties. Such renderings have recently become
popular as `small planet' images. Indeed, the horizon is a circle, and the full viewing sphere is
mapped inside the disk.
Koenderink et al. 23
The results from the analysis are clear enough. Virtually all participants are aware of a
scene that fits the space in front of them, with the view point outside of the configuration. The
relevant pictorial cues available to the observer are the horizontal separations, the heights in
the picture plane, the relative heights of the actors and the apparent spatial attitudes with
respect to the local visual direction (frontal, posterior or profile view, in the latter case facing
left or right). The angular extent of the configuration is not indicated, thus it has to be
assumed by the observer. It will necessarily be idiosyncratic. From previous experience
with picture perception one may expect values to lie about the right angle, albeit with a
huge spread. This is indeed what we find.
In any case, the results are clear evidence for the fact that the magic circle is almost
impenetrable, only 1 of our 61 participants spontaneously succeeding. As we have shown
in a related study, the same holds for the magic sphere ­ the viewing sphere (Koenderink &
van Doorn, in press). For the latter case historical evidence for an intellectual awareness of
this topo-agnosia existed for centuries (Goldstein & Hon, 2007; Stevenson, 1921). We are not
aware of such evidence relating to the magical circle though.
By way of conclusion, it is easily possible to design configurations that will be interpreted
by virtually all observers in some intended nonveridical manner. Since photographs (other
than drawings or paintings) tend to be taken for optical truth, this may well be of interest to
movie directors and illustrators. It may also serve as a warning against ill-considered use of
wide panoramic images for applications in which a roughly veridical impression is desirable.
Think of the real estate business, travel agencies and so forth. It is perhaps especially
important in the court room (Carter, 2010; Sholik, 2015). Whether straight-out-of-the-
camera panoramic images might be admitted as legal evidence should be a serious issue.
