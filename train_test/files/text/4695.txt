Abstract. Surface properties provide useful information for identifying objects and interacting with
them. Effective utilization of this information, however, requires that the perception of object surface
properties be relatively constant across changes in illumination and changes in object shape. Such
constancy has been studied separately for changes in these factors. Here we ask whether the
separate study of the illumination and shape effects is sufficient, by testing whether joint effects
of illumination and shape changes can be predicted from the individual effects in a straightforward
manner. We found large interactions between illumination and object shape in their effects on
perceived glossiness. In addition, analysis of luminance histogram statistics could not account for
the interactions.
Keywords: vision, material perception, surface reflectance, illumination, shape, conjoint measurement, percep-
tual constancy, luminance histogram statistics.
1 Introduction
Visual perception of object surface reflectance properties can aid object identification and
guide tactile interaction with objects (Adelson 2001). For example, how glossy an object
appears provides information about how tightly it should be gripped to avoid slippage.
The percepts are useful, however, only to the extent that they are stable across variation in
illumination and object shape. Because the light reflected from an object varies with these
object-extrinsic factors, stable perception of surface properties requires visual processing of
the raw retinal image (see Figure 1). A fundamental question is how and to what extent such
stabilization is accomplished by the visual system.
The geometric aspects of a surface's reflectance can be approximated by its bidirectional
reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which describes the amount of light reflected as a
function of the directions of the incident and reflected light (Nicodemus et al 1977). Moreover,
the BRDFs of many common surfaces can be described by simple parametric models. Here
we will employ the isotropic Ward BRDF model (Ward 1992). At each wavelength, this model
specifies reflectance as the sum of a non-directional diffuse component (d) and a directional
specular component. The strength of the specular component is described by the parameter
s and its spatial spread by a roughness parameter . We assume s and  are constant as a
function of wavelength, while d has a spectral dependence. Roughly speaking, the perceived
color and lightness of an object correlate with the diffuse reflectance component, while the
perceived glossiness correlates with the specular component.
The constancy of surface color and lightness perception for flat matte objects and simple
illumination geometries has been extensively studied and is now fairly well understood (see
reviews on lightness by Adelson (2000) and Kingdom (2010) and on color by Shevell and
Kingdom (2008) and Brainard and Maloney (2011). Perception of color and lightness for

Figure 1. This scene contains objects with different surface geometries, shapes, and surface re-
flectance properties viewed under spatially varying illumination. The identification of surface
material--porcelain, fabric, wood, glass--is important for object identification and action planning
but is complicated by the fact that the signal coming to the eye depends not only on surface reflectance
but also on the illumination and object shape. The insets on the right show close-ups of different parts
in the image, with the numbers next to the insets corresponding to the numbers in the picture. Note,
for example, the variation in the image corresponding to different locations on the vase (locations 1
and 2) and the similarity between a location on the vase (location 2) and on the wooden window sill
(location 3). The photograph is courtesy of Toni Saarela.
non-matte and three-dimensional objects has historically received less attention but is being
actively studied, perhaps because of the availability of computer graphic techniques for
stimulus generation and display (see Maloney and Brainard 2010). Similarly, the study of the
perceptual correlates of geometric aspects of object reflectance (aka material properties) is
also of much current interest (again, see Maloney and Brainard 2010).
It is clear that human observers can judge the glossiness of three-dimensional objects
and that this percept varies with the specular component of object reflectance (eg, Beck
and Prazdny 1981, Blake and Bülthoff 1990, Pellacini et al 2000; Fleming et al 2003; Obein
et al 2004; Ji et al 2006). Which aspects of the image drive this percept are less clear. Some
authors have emphasized the causal role of low-level image cues derived from the luminance
histogram of the object's image (Nishida and Shinya 1998; Motoyoshi et al 2007; Sharan et
al 2008), while others have noted the importance of the relationship between luminance
variation and perceived object shape (Beck and Prazdny 1981; Blake and Bülthoff 1990;
Berzhanskaya et al 2005; Anderson and Kim 2009; Kim and Anderson 2010; Kim et al 2011;
Marlow et al 2011). There have also been some initial studies of the stability of perceived
glossiness under variations in scene illumination (Fleming et al 2003; te Pas and Pont 2005;
Pont and te Pas 2006; Doerschner, Boyaci et al 2010; Olkkonen and Brainard 2010), variations
in surface geometry (Nishida and Shinya 1998; Ho et al 2008; Wendt et al 2010; Wijnthes
and Pont 2010), and variations in object shape (Vangorp et al 2007). Taken as a whole these
studies indicate that the visual system does stabilize the percept to some degree, but by no
1016 M Olkkonen, D H Brainard
means perfectly. It is not well-understood how the stabilization is accomplished, nor when it
works well and when it fails.
Human observers can also judge the lightness of three-dimensional objects even when
they are viewed in isolation (Beck 1964; Sharan et al 2008). This is possible because of the
shadows and interreflections caused by the three-dimensional surface structure, which
provide cues to surface reflectance. In addition, Motoyoshi et al (2007) and Sharan et al (2008)
found that perceived lightness was relatively stable when the specular component of surface
reflectance was varied (see also Xiao and Brainard 2008). There were some deviations from
constancy, however, and these authors proposed a theory that based perceived lightness on
luminance histogram statistics to account for their results. Data from other authors, however,
suggest that such simple theories do not generalize well to a broader class of stimulus
conditions (Anderson and Kim 2009; see also Beck 1964; Todd et al 2004). The discrimination
of diffuse reflectance also depends on illumination geometry and object shape (Khang et
al 2003), and it is better under some illuminants than others. As with perceived glossiness,
there have not been studies that covary both illumination geometry and object shape.
The fact that perceived lightness and glossiness vary with both illumination geometry
and object shape raises a fundamental question: Do these effects interact? This question is
important, since the answer will provide guidance about the generality of conclusions that
may be drawn from studies that vary object shape under a fixed illumination geometry (eg,
Nishida and Shinya 1998; Vangorp et al 2007; Ho et al 2008; Wendt et al 2010) and studies
that vary illumination geometry for a fixed object shape (eg, Fleming et al 2003; Pont and te
Pas 2006; Doerschner, Boyaci et al 2010; Olkkonen and Brainard 2010). Indeed, if these two
factors interact, understanding the perception of glossiness and lightness for natural images
will either require a large database of factorial measurements or a theory of the interaction
that would enable prediction of the joint effects from a smaller set of measurements. Since
making a full set of factorial measurements is not tractable, we believe that exploring the
question of interactions is a priority.
Here we report experiments that study the perception of both glossiness and lightness
for three-dimensional objects and concentrate on the stability of these percepts across joint
variations in illumination geometry and object shape. To minimize artifacts that might result
from the limited dynamic range of conventional computer displays (Phillips et al 2009;
Doerschner, Boyaci et al 2010), we used a custom high-dynamic range display so that our
stimuli incorporated the large variations in luminance that can be generated by specular
reflection under directional illumination. We tested whether the data for joint manipulations
of shape and illumination geometry could be predicted by models that treat the effects of
each variable as separable and found profound interactions for judgments of glossiness. We
asked whether the interactions could be accounted for by image-based models that have
been suggested by others but found that these also failed. Our data thus provide a challenge
for future modeling efforts.
2 Methods
The purpose of the experiments was to measure how changing both illumination
geometry and object shape affect perceived glossiness and lightness. On each trial of the
experiment, observers judged which of two objects appeared glossier or lighter (depending
on the trial type), and a staircase procedure was used to adjust the reflectance properties of
one of the objects to seek the point of subjective equality. The objects could either be the
same shape illuminated by different light fields, different shapes illuminated by the same
light field, or different shapes illuminated by different light fields.

2.1 Observers
Four naive observers participated in the experiment. All four ran conditions with the
Grove/Kitchen light field pair (see below for explanation of the conditions). Three of the
four observers also ran conditions with the Grove/Galileo light field pair. All participants
had normal visual acuity (20/20) as verified with a Snellen chart and normal color vision
as verified with the Ishihara color plates. The experimental protocols were approved by the
human subjects institutional review board (IRB) at the University of Pennsylvania and were
in accordance with the World Medical Association Helsinki Declaration as revised in October
2008 (http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html).
2.2 Stimuli
We generated two shapes using the Maya 3D modeling software (Autodesk, Inc.) by modu-
lating a sphere with three sinusoids of different frequencies, phases, and amplitudes (see
Figure 2). For mnemonic convenience, we refer to the shapes as Blob and Pepper. Wireframe
models of the shapes were exported from Maya and rendered with specified reflectance
parameters under three real-world light fields captured by Debevec (1998). The rendering was
performed using Radiance (Ward 1994) via the RenderToolbox (www.rendertoolbox.org) Mat-
lab routines. The RenderToolbox provides wrappers that allow wavelength-by-wavelength
specification of surface reflectance and illuminant spectral power.

Figure 2. The reference stimulus set. The two levels of reference diffuse reflectance (d) are shown in
the two major columns and the two levels of reference specular reflectance (s) are shown in rows.
The three column images show the same stimulus rendered under three different light fields (Grove,
Kitchen, and Galileo). The two shapes are shown in the two major rows. The checkered backgrounds
have been cropped relative to their size in the experiment. The actual stimuli were high-dynamic
range images. To render the images for publication at a low dynamic range, they were transformed
from the LMS cone representation to the sRGB standard primaries, gamma corrected by taking the
square root of each value, and scaled by eye with high luminance values clipped, so as to preserve as
well as possible the relative appearances they had when displayed at high dynamic range. The same
procedures were used to produce the other stimulus images shown in the paper.
1018 M Olkkonen, D H Brainard
The diffuse reflectance of the object surface was that of surface 14 in the GretagMacbeth
color chart (Munsell notation 0.25G 5.4/8.65). To render the scenes spectrally within the
RenderToolbox environment, the RGB light fields provided by Debevec were converted to a
spectral representation. The procedure used is described in Olkkonen and Brainard (2010).
The light fields were scaled so that the mean luminance reflected from a matte Blob with the
diffuse reflectance of Munsell 0.25G 5.4/8.65 was the same for each light field. We chose a
target mean luminance for the matte images of 4 cd/m2, which was a compromise between
obtaining a reasonably high mean luminance and minimizing the amount of tone mapping
required to render the stimuli. The light fields varied in their mean chromaticities, a feature
that was preserved in the experimental stimuli. We refer to the light fields as Kitchen, Grove,
and Galileo, based on the locations where they were captured (a kitchen, a eucalyptus grove,
and Galileo's tomb).
The objects varied in their geometric reflectance properties. As described in the intro-
duction, we used the isotropic Ward (1992) BRDF model and specified geometric reflectance
using its specular (s), diffuse (d), and roughness () parameters. A value of d = 1
corresponded to a diffuse spectral reflectance function equal to that of Munsell 0.25G
5.4/8.65, and other values scaled this reflectance function equally at all wavelengths. On any
given trial, two stimuli were shown, a reference stimulus, which could take on any of four
reflectances, and a comparison stimulus, whose reflectance was determined by an adaptive
staircase algorithm (see Procedure). We chose two levels of reference specular reflectance
(s = [0.04 0.16]) and two levels of diffuse reflectance (d = [.4 .9]). The roughness parameter
was kept constant at Ward  = 0.01.
The rendering procedure resulted in a hyperspectral image with 31 planes, with each
plane corresponding to one wavelength band. Sample wavelengths were between 400 and
700 nm at 10 nm steps. The hyperspectral image was converted to an LMS cone image using
the Stockman-Sharpe two-degree cone fundamentals (Stockman and Sharpe 2000). Where
required, tone mapping was accomplished by setting pixels with luminances above the
maximum displayable value (460 cd/m2 ) to that value while preserving their chromaticities.
During the experiment, we needed to vary the reflectance properties of the comparison
stimuli. To do so rapidly, we adjusted and combined two pre-rendered basis images (Griffin
1999; Xiao and Brainard 2008; Olkkonen and Brainard 2010). One basis image contained a
matte stimulus and one a glossy stimulus. By taking the difference between the glossy and
matte basis images, we could extract a difference image that represented the effect of adding
a specular component to the stimulus' reflectance. To generate stimuli with different levels
of specularity, we combined the matte basis image with the difference image and varied the
weight on the difference image. To simulate different levels of diffuse reflectance, we scaled
the matte basis image prior to combination with the scaled difference image.
The stimuli were embedded in a checkerboard background, where the chromaticities and
luminances of single checks were drawn from a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution
with mean x = 0.34, y = 0.35, Y = 7.1 and standard deviation x = 0.014, y = 0.011, Y = 2.02 (Judd-
Vos xyY). The values approximate the mean and standard deviation xyY values averaged
across the bit maps of the three light fields used in the experiments.
Table 1 lists the CIE chromaticities and luminances of the reference stimuli, obtained by
taking the spatial mean over each object.
2.3 Apparatus
The stimuli were displayed on a custom high-dynamic-range (HDR) display. Briefly, the
display consisted of an LCD flat-panel display with the backlight replaced by a three-chip
DLP video-projector that illuminated the LCD screen with a projected image. By controlling
the input setting to both LCD screen and DLP projector, this arrangement allows large (>

10,000:1) modulation of the image intensity at each pixel. Both display devices were driven at
a pixel resolution of 1280 by 1024 and at a refresh rate of 60 Hz through a dual-port video card
(NVIDIA GeForce GT 120). The host computer was an Apple Macintosh with a quad-core Intel
Xeon processor. The display is described in detail in an earlier report (Olkkonen and Brainard
2010). Since publication of that work, some improvements in the calibration and display
control software were implemented. These are described in a technical report (Radonji´
c et al
2011). The maximum luminance of the display was 460 cd/m2. The minimum luminance
was below the measurement range of our radiometer, but at least a factor of 10,000 below the
maximum luminance.
The experiment was programmed in Matlab (MathWorks, Inc) with display control
functions based on the MGL toolbox (http://justingardner.net/mgl) and the Psychtoolbox
(Brainard 1997; Pelli 1997). We used the Jacket software (http://www.accelereyes.com/) to
offload some computations to a second GeForce GT 120 video card, which enabled us to
perform rapidly the calculations needed to render the stimuli on each trial.
2.4 Procedure
On each trial of the experiment, two stimuli were presented side by side on the display.
The checkerboard backgrounds subtended 9.3 degrees of visual angle on each side, with
the shapes subtending approximately 6 x 6 degrees. The distance between the centers of
the reference and comparison shapes was 9.3 degrees. The reflectance of the reference
stimulus remained the same throughout one block. The left-right locations of the reference
and comparison were randomized on each trial. The observer's task was to respond which
stimulus appeared glossier/lighter depending on the trial. In 12 consecutive trials, the
observer gave glossiness estimates; in the following 12 trials, lightness estimates, and so on.
The observer was alerted when the judgment changed via synthesized speech emitted from
the computer. In addition, the current judgment was indicated by white text at the top of
the display. The exact instructions given to the observers are provided in the supplementary
materials available at http://color.psych.upenn.edu/supplements/materialshape/.
For any given reference stimulus, there were four interleaved staircases: two for lightness
judgments and two for the glossiness judgments. For each staircase, the starting reflectance
parameters of the comparison were picked either below or above the reference values (two
in each direction), and were consequently changed by a 1-up, 1-down procedure. In a given
block, the reflectance of the reference stimulus was kept constant, and there were two
reference shapes and two reference light fields. As each staircase had 15 trials, there were 240
trials in total in one block. Each block was repeated twice to get two estimates for each data
point.
There were three blocked change conditions whose order was counterbalanced across
observers. In one condition, the two stimuli in a given trial had the same shape, but differed in
1020 M Olkkonen, D H Brainard
illumination geometry (change light field). This condition measured the effect of illumination
geometry on perceived reflectance. In another condition, the two stimuli within a trial had
different shapes, but the same illumination geometry (change shape). Here, the effect of
object shape on perceived reflectance was measured. In the third condition, the stimuli had
both different shapes and different illumination geometries (change both). This condition
measured the joint effect of changing illumination and object shape on perceived reflectance.
The experiment was run for two light field comparisons: Grove/Kitchen and
Grove/Galileo. The experiment was completed first for one comparison, after which the
other comparison was run. The order of the two comparisons was counterbalanced across
observers. Note that the shape change trials were the same for Grove in both comparisons
and were run only once for one of the observers to minimize the length of the whole
experiment. For the other observers the conditions were run in full.
2.5 Data analysis
We quantified perceived glossiness and lightness as follows. For a given reference stimulus,
change condition, and judgment type, we averaged the reversals in each staircase after
discarding the first two reversals. We then averaged over staircases to obtain the point of
subjective equality (PSE). In 4% of the cases, the perceptual effects were so large that there
were no reversals before the comparison reflectance parameters led to stimuli that reached
the luminance limit of the display, in which case we took this most extreme possible stimulus
value as an approximation of the PSE. The display limits are indicated in the data figures, so
that such points may be easily identified.
We further summarized the data for each change condition and judgment type with linear
regression lines fit to the data for all reference stimuli for that condition/judgment (Olkkonen
and Brainard 2010). We assumed the offset of all lines to be zero and used just the slope
parameter for the fits. The slopes were taken as a measure of the perceptual effect in each
condition. For each judgment and change condition, we obtained four slopes. For example,
for the glossiness judgments in the light field change condition there were two shapes and
two levels of reference diffuse reflectance leading to four regression lines.
3 Results
3.1 Effects of illumination geometry
We found large effects of illumination geometry on perceived glossiness, confirming our
previous findings for spheres. This is shown for a representative observer in Figure 3a.
Each data point shows the specularity values for a pair of stimuli that matched across the
Grove/Kitchen light field change; data for the Blob (circles) and Pepper (squares) are shown
separately. The deviations of the data from the unity diagonal indicate the perceptual effect
of the light change.
Figure 4a summarizes the effects with the regression slopes for all of the observers. Here,
the deviation of slopes from unity indicates the perceptual effect. The data are generally
similar across the two levels of diffuse reflectance, indicating that to first order it is sufficient
to characterize the effect of illumination geometry on perceived glossiness by studying one
level of reference stimulus diffuse reflectance (see, also, Olkkonen and Brainard 2010). Note
that the effect of light field is quite different for the two shapes, and for some observers (GLA,
OCL) the effect is in the opposite direction relative to the unity line.
Data for the Grove/Galileo light field change are plotted in the same format as Figure 4a in
the supplementary materials (Figure S8a). The effects for that light field change were variable
across observers, but in general the light field again affected perceived glossiness. For one
observer, there was a clear effect of shape on the effect of the light field.

Black symbols denote data for stimuli with low diffuse reflectance; pink symbols denote stimuli
with high diffuse reflectance. Error bars show the standard error of the mean over two repetitions
of the condition. Symbols with horizontal error bars indicate pairs where the stimulus under Grove
(x axis) was the comparison and the stimulus under Kitchen (y axis) was the reference. Symbols
with the vertical error bars indicate the opposite case. The diagonal dashed line indicates unity; the
horizontal and vertical dashed lines indicate the reflectance parameter space of the display. (b) Points

exception that here the black and pink symbols indicate stimuli with low and high specular reflectance,
respectively. Corresponding plots for all observers for both light field changes are provided in the
supplementary materials (Figures S1­S7).
Figure 3b shows the effect of illumination geometry on perceived lightness for observer
OCL. All data points lie above the diagonal, showing that for both shapes and both levels
of specular reflectance the stimuli under the Kitchen light field had to have slightly higher
diffuse reflectance to perceptually match the stimuli under the Grove light field. Notably,
though, the effect of light field on perceived lightness was relatively small compared with
the effect on perceived glossiness, and similar for both shapes and both levels of specular
reflectance. The smaller effects may arise from the fact that our manipulations of illumination
geometry were performed under conditions where the mean illuminant intensity was
approximately equated (see Methods).
Figure 4b summarizes the effects on lightness for all observers. Note that the scale on
the y-axis is expanded relative to Figure 4a. Again, the data were similar for all observers.
There was a small effect of illumination geometry on perceived lightness, but no interaction
between light field and shape. Also, the effects did not depend strongly on stimulus specular
reflectance, although there is a tendency for a larger effect for the higher level of specular
reflectance. The data for the Grove/Galileo light field change are plotted in the same format
as Figure 4b in the supplementary materials (Figure S8b). As with the glossiness judgments,
there was more observer variability for this light field change. Two observers, however,
showed clear effects of the light field on perceived lightness.
3.2 Effects of shape
We found a large effect of shape on perceived glossiness when illumination geometry was
kept constant. This is illustrated in Figure 5a for observer OCL. The data are shown in the

same format as in Figure 3, but here the axes are the specularities for the two shapes instead
of for the two light fields. The data fall below or above the diagonal depending on the light
field, in other words, the effect of shape was opposite for the two light fields.
Figure 6a shows the slopes for glossiness estimates across a shape change for all observers.
The two sets of bars in each panel show data for the two light fields. As in the light field
comparison, there was an interaction between the effect of light field and that of shape for
all observers. In addition, for all observers except for VHY the results were similar for the two
levels of diffuse reflectance.
The effects of shape on perceived lightness, shown in Figure 5b for OCL and summarized
in Figure 6b for all observers, were small, and there was not a large interaction between shape
and light field.
Data for the Grove/Galileo light field change are shown in the supplementary materials
(Figure S9). There was again a large effect of shape on perceived glossiness, with an
interaction shown by one of three observers. The effects on lightness were small relative to
the effects on glossiness.
3.3 Joint effects
The results from the change light field and change shape conditions show a strong interaction
between object shape and illumination geometry for glossiness judgments. To probe this
interaction further, we ran a third condition where observers made glossiness and lightness
judgments across joint changes in light field and shape. That is, we directly measured matches
across changes in both illuminant and shape (eg, Blob/Grove and Pepper/Kitchen).
Slopes of the linear regression fits for the Grove/Kitchen comparison are shown in Figure 7.
The glossiness estimates were more variable across observers than in the single change

glossiness across a change in shape for observer OCL. A given data point shows a pair of specularity
values for two shapes that match in perceived glossiness. Diamonds show data for the Grove light field,
and stars show data for the Kitchen light field. Black symbols denote data for stimuli with low diffuse
reflectance; light red symbols denote stimuli with high diffuse reflectance. The error bars show the
standard error of the mean over two repetitions. Symbols with horizontal error bars indicate pairs
where the Blob (x-axis) was the comparison and the Pepper (y-axis) was the reference. Symbols with
vertical error bars indicate the opposite case. The diagonal dashed line indicates unity; the horizontal
and vertical dashed lines indicate the reflectance parameter space of the display. (b) Points of equal

Corresponding plots for all observers for both light field changes are provided in the supplementary
materials (Figures S1­S7).
while the fourth observer (CDI) showed a clear difference between the two levels of diffuse
reflectance. The data for the lightness estimates were less variable across observers and were
qualitatively, if not quantitatively, similar for the two levels of specular reflectance. Data
for the Grove/Galileo light field change are shown in the supplementary materials (Figure
S10), with large effects shown for perceived glossiness and smaller, less consistent effects for
perceived lightness.
Our first analysis of the joint measurements checked the consistency of the measurement
procedure by asking whether the measurements satisfied transitivity (see Doerschner, Boyaci
et al 2010). What we mean by this may be understood with reference to Figure 8a. The
measurements for shape and illuminant changes alone are characterized by slopes. We
denote these effects by the red arrows in the figure. For example, the arrow labeled A indicates
the effect of changing the illuminant from Grove to Kitchen for the Blob shape. Since each
of the effects we measure are reasonably described by a multiplicative scaling (slope of the
fit regression lines), the slope obtained for a joint change (indicated in the figure by the
dashed blue arrow for Blob/Grove to Pepper/Kitchen) should be predicted by the product of
the slopes obtained for the component changes. For the case illustrated by the figure, this
product may be obtained from slopes for the two measurements indicated by the red arrows.
We compared predictions made in this way against the joint measurement for shape and
illuminant changes.
Figure 9 summarizes the results of the transitivity check for glossiness (left panel) and
lightness (right panel). For most of the measurements, transitivity held well. In the figure,
the solid points are those where the prediction error for the slope of the joint measurement

obtained from both pairs of individual measurements was less than 0.8 for both glossiness
and lightness. This criterion was chosen by eye. For the glossiness measurements, this
criterion was met for 47 out of 56 cases (84%, solid points). For lightness, all of the cases
satisfied the criterion. As we viewed transitivity of the data as a prerequisite for asking
questions about how well candidate models might predict joint effects, we restricted our
subsequent analysis of the joint effects to conditions corresponding to the solid points in
Figure 9a.
Since both illumination geometry and shape affect lightness and glossiness, understand-
ing these phenomena requires at minimum measurements of the effect of each variable
when the other is held fixed. If the effects of the two variables do not interact, the joint effects
can be characterized by measurements of each alone at one fixed level of the other. This idea
is illustrated by Figure 8b. Here the question becomes whether the joint effect illustrated by
the dashed blue line (E) is predicted by the product of the effects of the two red arrows, A
and C. Note that when separability holds, the number of measurements required to jointly
characterize effects of light field and shape increases linearly with the number of light fields
and shapes studied, while in the general case, the number increases as the product of the two
conditions. Thus if the data satisfy separability, the joint measurement enterprise is greatly
simplified.
Separability does not hold in general for the glossiness estimates for either of the light
field conditions (Grove/Kitchen and Grove/Galileo), as shown by Figure 9b (left panel; only
predictions that met the transitivity criterion are plotted). The large failures shown are a
consequence of the interactions shown in Figures 4 and 6 above. The analysis here confirms
that such interactions are typical of the entire dataset.
Interestingly, the predictions for glossiness span a much wider range of values than the
data. This indicates that for the stimuli employed here independence of the light field and

shape effects would make the stimulus pairs in the joint condition to appear much more
different (shown with slopes deviating widely from unity) than how the observers perceived
them.
Separability holds better for the lightness estimates (Figure 9b, right panel), and indeed
the quality of the separability predictions is similar to that of the transitivity predictions.
3.4 Image statistics
Our results show that both illumination geometry and object shape can have a large effect
on perceived glossiness. In addition, the effect of a combined light field and shape change on
glossiness cannot be easily predicted from the individual effects. Scrutinizing the stimulus
images in Figure 8 provides some intuition to why this is so: It is hard to describe the result
of combining the two changes as an addition or a product of the changes seen for each
manipulation alone.
Some authors have suggested that simple luminance histogram statistics predict per-
ceived reflectance and in particular perceived glossiness (Nishida and Shinya 1998; Mo-
toyoshi et al 2007; Sharan et al 2008). Anderson and Kim (2009) have pointed out limitations
of such models. In addition, models based on luminance histogram statistics did not work
well in our hands when we tried to use them to account for effects of illumination geometry
on the perceived glossiness of spheres (Olkkonen and Brainard 2010). Nonetheless, it remains
of topical interest to understand the role of luminance histogram statistics, particularly for
the perception of glossiness, and we thus asked how well our current data could be accounted
for with models that predict perceptual equivalence on the basis of equating such statistics.

Figure 8. (a) The transitivity of the effects of light field and shape on perceived reflectance can be
understood as follows. The arrow labeled A shows changes from the Grove light field to the Kitchen light
field for the Blob shape, whereas the arrow labeled B shows changes from the Blob to the Pepper for
the Kitchen light field. If transitivity holds, the effect of changing from Grove/Blob to Kitchen/Pepper
(arrow E) should be the combination of the two separate effects (arrow A x arrow B). Note that a second
transitivity prediction for arrow E may also be obtained by multiplying the slope obtained for the
change from Blob to Pepper under the Grove light field and with the slope for the change from Grove
to Kitchen for the Pepper. (b) If separability holds, the joint change of light field and shape (arrow E)
should be a combination of changing the light field (arrow A) and changing the shape (arrow C) for the
same reference stimulus (arrow A x arrow C). Note that a second separability prediction for arrow E
may be obtained by multiplying the slope for the change for Blob to Pepper under the Kitchen light
field with the slope for the change from Grove to Kitchen for the Pepper.
First, we calculated the statistics of the luminance histograms of the Blob and Pepper
objects, across changes in light field, shape, or both for stimuli of constant reflectance.
These calculations provide a useful benchmark, as they tell us the relation between the
statistics that we would expect for a visual system that exhibited perfect glossiness constancy.
Next, we calculated the same statistics for stimuli that matched in perceived (but not
physical) reflectance. These stimuli matched in both perceived glossiness and perceived
lightness. According to the image statistics hypothesis, perceptually important statistics
should match for these stimuli. We chose to analyze the standard deviation and skewness,
based on previous reports that considered perceived glossiness, and added a third statistic
that measured the number of bright pixels in the image (defined as those with more than five
times the mean luminance of the whole stimulus).
The results of these analyses are shown in Figure 10a­b. Figure 10a illustrates the
effect of changing the light field, shape, or both light field and shape on the statistics
of physically matching stimuli. Each data point shows a particular stimulus with fixed
reflectance undergoing either a light field, shape, or a joint change. Figure 10b shows the
statistics across perceptually matching stimuli for all three change types. If observers are
sensitive to a given statistic, we would expect the data points to fall considerably closer to
the diagonal than in Figure 10a. This was not the case.
Figure 10c rules out a possible artifactual reason for the predictive failure of the luminance
histogram statistics: if the stimulus manipulations available to our subjects did not allow
equating of a particular statistic, it would not be possible for the model to work. We thus used
numerical parameter search to find the best match for each experimental condition and

cases, perfect equation is possible. Open circles show cases where stimulus limitations
prevented a match. In Figure 10a­b only points corresponding to the closed circles in

the statistic under consideration could have been matched within our experiment.

because they are calculated over the whole image such that the spatial properties of

the highlights and their relationship to shading are not taken into account. To probe
this possibility, we analyzed the statistics in several additional ways: by selecting a few
informative subbands of the luminance channel, by selecting two regions of interest (ROI) on
predominantly convex or concave parts of the object surfaces, and by extracting the specular
image and analyzing its statistics (Figure 11). The results are shown in the format of Figure 10
in the supplementary materials (Figures S11­S14), and lead to the same conclusion as the
analysis of the full luminance histogram. Perception was not determined by any of these
statistics.

3.5 Effect of stimulus movement
In an additional experiment with new observers, we tested whether stimulus movement
would aid in estimating surface reflectance in the face of changes in illumination or object
geometry, as Wendt et al (2010) have suggested. The results are presented in the Appendix
and show a slight improvement in constancy when the stimulus is rotated.

4 Discussion
4.1 Transitivity and separability
We checked whether our data satisfied transitivity (see Doerschner, Boyaci et al 2010).
This property held well for lightness but less well for glossiness. Indeed, there were large
violations of transitivity for glossiness for some of our measurement conditions. We do
not know the cause of these violations. It is possible that they arise because measurement
error is amplified when two measured quantities are multiplied, as is done when making
the transitivity predictions. This explanation, however, would predict similar violations for
glossiness and lightness and is thus not entirely satisfactory. It is possible that in making
pairwise comparisons, observers weight different image features differently depending on
the comparison, an effect which could produce transitivity violations. In any case, we used
the transitivity analysis to select only data points for which transitivity was satisfied in our
analysis of separability.
For glossiness estimates, separability did not hold. This means that extreme caution must
be used in generalizing results on the effect of object shape obtained under a single light field
or results on the effect of illumination geometry obtained for a single shape. For perceived
lightness, separability held reasonably well. It should be noted that in general the effects of
illumination geometry and shape on lightness were not large, so that there was less room for
violations of separability to arise.
4.2 Individual differences
There were some marked individual differences in how surface glossiness was perceived in
some of the experimental conditions, particularly for the Grove/Galileo comparison. We do
not know the cause of these differences. As with the transitivity failures, one possibility is that
different observers attended to different aspects of the stimuli when making their judgments.
Some observers noted that the glossiness comparison task was difficult, an observation
consistent with this interpretation, at least if one takes it to mean that observers were not
quite sure what aspect of the complex stimuli should be compared.
4.3 Relationship to previous research
The effect of illumination geometry on perceived reflectance has been shown in several
studies for different types of stimuli, but always for fixed object geometry. Fleming et al
(2003) showed that illumination geometry affected the perceived glossiness of spheres in
conventional displays, and Doerschner, Boyaci et al (2010) extended the result by showing
in binocularly viewed conventional displays that the effects were transitive across light
field changes. In addition, te Pas and Pont (2005) showed that changes in reflectance were
confused with changes in illumination geometry, especially for smooth rendered objects as
opposed to objects with three-dimensional surface texture (see also Pont and te Pas 2006).
Olkkonen and Brainard (2010) studied the perceived glossiness and lightness of spheres
in HDR displays, showing large effects of complex illumination geometry on perceived
glossiness. The present study extends the previous findings to more complex shapes in full-
color, HDR scenes, suggesting that the failures of reflectance constancy found in previous
studies were not due to missing color or luminance information or to the use of simple
shapes.
The effect of object shape on reflectance perception was first shown by Nishida and
Shinya (1998). They were able to account for their data on the assumption that observers
were basing their estimates about surface reflectance largely on the luminance histograms of
the images. More recently, Ho et al (2008) showed that surface mesotexture ("bumpiness")
affects the perceived glossiness of a surface. In effect, mesotexture was confounded with
surface glossiness to some extent (see, also, Wijntjes and Pont 2010). An effect of surface
Joint effects of illumination and shape 1031
geometry was also shown by Wendt et al (2010), who additionally found that surface rotation
and binocular viewing decreased the perceptual effects of shape. Notably, illumination
geometry was held constant in all of these experiments. Vangorp et al (2007) studied the
effect of object shape, rather than surface mesotexture, on perceived reflectance and showed
that reflectance estimation was difficult across shape changes, especially for objects with flat
geometry (such as tessellated spheres). Vangorp et al (2007) repeated the experiment with
several different illumination conditions, but in any given pair the illumination geometry was
held constant. They did not focus on whether the effect of shape depended on illumination
geometry, but did note that ability to judge glossiness differed for one of their illuminant
conditions. Our experiments confirmed the effects of object shape on perceived glossiness
and showed a strong dependence of the effects on illumination geometry.
To our knowledge, ours is the first study to investigate the joint effects of object shape
and illumination geometry on perceived reflectance.
4.4 Luminance histogram statistics
We were not able to account for our data on the basis of any of the luminance histogram statis-
tics we analyzed, nor with variants of these statistics computed from subband histograms,
regions of interest, or the specular reflectance component. Indeed, observers appeared to
be performing closer to constancy than to matching on the basis of luminance histogram
statistics (see, also, Olkkonen and Brainard 2010). Following Anderson and Kim (2009), we
speculate that previous studies that have been successful in accounting for the data on
the basis of luminance histogram statistics have obtained this result because the stimulus
manipulations were not sufficiently rich to reveal the type of failures we find. Indeed, an
important point emphasized by Beck and Prazdny (1981) and more recently by Anderson and
colleagues (Anderson and Kim 2009; Kim and Anderson 2010; Marlow et al 2011; Kim et al
2011) is that the perception of glossiness depends not only on the distribution of luminance
values in the image but also on the spatial distribution of the luminances. In a seminal
demonstration, Beck and Prazdny (1981) showed that objects appear glossier if the highlights
are oriented in the direction of minimum curvature on the surface. Rotation of the highlights
away from this point decreased apparent gloss (see, also, Berzhanskaya et al 2005). Similar
effects were shown by Anderson and Kim (2009) and Kim et al (2011) for objects with more
complex surface structure. In our stimuli, the illumination and shape manipulations induced
changes in both the luminance histograms and the spatial relations between highlights and
surface relief.
4.5 Summary
We studied the effects of illumination geometry and object shape on perceived glossiness
and lightness. In general, both manipulations affect both judgments. Of central importance,
we examined the joint effects of the two variables. For perceived glossiness, we found strong
interactions. The effect of a joint manipulation of both variables cannot be easily predicted
from measurements of each alone. In addition, we examined a number of luminance
histogram statistics as possible predictors of the glossiness effects, and found that none
explained the data. Our results present a challenge for future research on perceived glossiness,
as the enterprise of measuring the joint effects of illumination geometry and object shape
will not be tractable without the development of a theory that can account for the joint effects
without requiring full factorial measurements. Our conclusion on perceived lightness is more
optimistic. Although perceived lightness does vary with both object shape and illumination
geometry, we did not find large interactions between the two variables for the lightness
judgment.

Appendix: Rotation experiment
We ran an additional experiment to test whether stimulus movement would serve as a cue to
object and illumination geometry and make the perception of reflectance more veridical. Four new
observers, one author (KMO) and three naive to the purposes of the study, participated. The display
was the same as in the main experiment, except for the fact that the stimuli were rotating around
their vertical axes 5 degrees in each direction from the neutral position (perpendicular to the line
of sight). The movement was linear with a sinusoidal ramp at each end to make the rotation appear
smoother. Only glossiness judgments were collected.
The PSEs were collected with the method of constant stimuli instead of a staircase procedure
due to computer memory limitations. To provide a direct comparison, data were collected for
both stationary and rotating stimuli. We studied illumination changes and changes of object shape
separately.

As in the main experiment, we quantified the perceptual effects of changing light field or shape
by fitting one-parameter linear regression lines to each data set separately for each observer, and
taking the slope as the size of the effect. We computed the perceptual bias as the deviation of the
slopes from unity. In most cases (11 of 16), rotation reduced the bias (Figure A1, where most of the
points lie below the diagonal). Our results are consistent with recent reports by Wendt et al (2010)
and Sakano and Ando (2010) and suggest that in real-world viewing motion cues may help stabilize
the perception of glossiness.

Figure A1. The relationship of the perceptual bias in glossiness judgments for the stationary and
rotating stimuli. Each data point shows the deviation of a slope from unity for a particular observer
and condition for stationary stimuli (x-axis) and the deviation from unity of a slope for the same
condition for rotating stimuli (y-axis). Symbols stand for different observers as indicated in the legend.
The two experimental conditions, change light field and change shape field are shown in orange and
blue, respectively.
Maria Olkkonen received her MA in psychology from the University of Helsinki in 2004,
after which she did a PhD on color constancy with Professor Karl Gegenfurtner at Giessen
University. After receiving her degree in 2009, she moved on to work on material perception
with Professor David Brainard at the University of Pennsylvania. She is currently a
postdoctoral associate at Rutgers University with Dr. Sarah Allred, studying the relationship
between color constancy and color memory.
David Brainard received his AB in physics from Harvard University (1982) and MS
(electrical engineering) and PhD (psychology) from Stanford University in 1989. He is
currently Professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and his research
focuses on human color vision and color image processing. He is a fellow of the Optical
Society of America and the Association for Psychological Science.
