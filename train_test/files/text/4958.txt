ABSTRACT
A number of studies suggest that OLGs (oligodendrocytes),
the myelinating cells of the central nervous system, are also
a source of trophic molecules, such as neurotrophins that
may influence survival of proximate neurons. What is less
clear is how the release of these molecules may be
regulated. The present study investigated the effects of
BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) derived from
cortical OLGs on proximate neurons, as well as regulatory
mechanisms mediating BDNF release. Initial work deter-
mined that BDNF derived from cortical OLGs increased the
numbers of VGLUT1 (vesicular glutamate transporter 1)-
positive glutamatergic cortical neurons. Furthermore,
glutamate acting through metabotropic, and not AMPA/
kainate or NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), receptors
increased BDNF release. The PLC (phospholipase C) pathway
is a key mediator of metabotropic actions to release BDNF
in astrocytes and neurons. Treatment of OLGs with the PLC
activator m-3M3FBS [N-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-2,4,6-
trimethylbenzenesulfonamide] induced robust release of
BDNF. Moreover, release elicited by the metabotropic
receptor agonist ACPD [trans-(1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopen-
tane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid] was inhibited by the PLC
antagonist U73122, the IP3
(inositol triphosphate 3)
receptor inhibitor 2-APB (2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane)
and the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM [1,2-bis-
(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N9,N9-tetra-acetic acid tetra-
kis(acetoxymethyl ester)]. Taken together, these results
suggest that OLG lineage cells release BDNF, a molecule
trophic for proximate neurons. BDNF release is regulated by
glutamate acting through mGluRs (metabotropic glutamate
receptors) and the PLC pathway. Thus glutamate and BDNF
may be molecules that support neuron­OLG interactions in
the cortex.

INTRODUCTION
OLGs (oligodendrocytes) are known classically as the
myelinating cells of the CNS (central nervous system). As
such, they play an important role in increasing the
conduction velocity of the action potential by forming
myelin sheaths, and thereby promoting saltatory conduction
down the axon. In recent years, however, OLG lineage cells
have begun to be appreciated as an important source of
trophic factors. For example, growth factors such as GDNF
(glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor), IGF-1 (insulin-like
growth factor-1), TGF-b (transforming growth factor-b) and
others are expressed by OLG lineage cells in culture (da Cunha
et al., 1993; McKinnon et al., 1993; Shinar and McMorris,
1995; Raabe et al., 1997; Hayase et al., 1998; Strelau and
Unsicker, 1999; Wilkins et al., 2001; Wilkins et al., 2003).

Studies in our laboratory and others have revealed that NTs
(neurotrophins) are also OLG lineage cell-derived (Byravan et
al., 1994; Dai et al., 2001, 2003). We have found that NGF
(nerve growth factor), BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic
factor) and NT3 mRNAs are expressed by BF (basal forebrain)
and CC (corpus callosal) OLGs, as well as OLGs in the frontal,
cingulate and parietal cortical regions at postnatal ages in
vivo. NT proteins and mRNAs are associated with BF OLGs in
culture (Dai et al., 2001, 2003) and BDNF and NT3 produced
by BF OLGs enhance the survival and function of BF
cholinergic neurons (Dai et al., 2003). Thus the results
suggest that OLG-derived NTs are trophic for nearby neurons
in the CNS.
What is not as clear is how release of the NTs may be
regulated. We suggest that neurotransmitters may play a role.
OLGs express a number of neurotransmitter receptors and
OLG function and development are influenced by neuronal
signals (Patneau et al., 1994; Ghiani et al., 1999; Ragheb et
al., 2001; Rogers et al., 2001; Stevens et al., 2002; Luyt et al.,
2003; Deng et al., 2004; Karadottir and Attwell, 2007; Luyt et
al., 2007). Of particular interest to us is that glutamate
receptors are present on OLG lineage cells (Yoshioka et al.,
1995; Matute et al., 1997; Luyt et al., 2003; Deng et al., 2004;
Karadottir et al., 2005; Salter and Fern, 2005; Luyt et al.,
2006; Micu et al., 2006). Studies on other cell types suggest
that such receptors may regulate trophin content. For
example, glutamate increases BDNF release in hippocampal
neurons and in glial cells, such as astrocytes, Schwann cells
and Muller cells (Canossa et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2003;
Verderio et al., 2006; Jean et al., 2009). BDNF is of interest
because it is a factor that influences neuronal survival,
proliferation and differentiation (Alderson et al., 1990;
Hyman et al., 1991; Friedman et al., 1993; Bartkowska et
al., 2007). Regulation of release of this factor by OLGs,
therefore, may have important roles on proximate neurons.
In the present study, we investigated the possibility that
glutamate signals may influence BDNF release from cortical
OLGs. We report that OLG-derived BDNF increases numbers of
VGLUT1(+) (where VGLUT1 is vesicular glutamate transporter
1) glutamatergic neurons. Moreover, glutamate, through the
activation of metabotropic receptors and the PLC (phospho-
lipase C) pathway, increases BDNF release by OLGs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental animals
Time-mated Sprague­Dawley rats (Hilltop Laboratories) were
housed in clear plastic cages with corncob bedding and
nestlets. Food and water were available ad libitum. The
animals were managed by the UMDNJ/Robert Wood Johnson
Animal Facility, which is accredited by AAALAC (the
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care). Animal transportation, maintenance, husbandry
and housing were in compliance with the Laboratory Animal
Welfare Act (PL 89-544; PL-91-579). Use of animals was also
in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guide-
lines (NIH Manual Chapter 4206).
OLG-enriched cultures
OLGs were purified using a modification (Gallo et al., 1996) of
the method of (McCarthy and de Vellis, 1980). Postnatal day 1
rat pups were killed by hypothermia-induced anaesthesia
followed by exsanguination. The frontal, parietal and
cingulate cortices were dissected, mechanically dissociated
and plated on to 75 cm2 flasks precoated with poly-D-lysine
(0.1 mg/ml). The dissociated cells were cultured in NM-15
(nutrient medium-15), containing MEM (minimal essential
medium) with Earle's salts and L-glutamine (Cellgro),
supplemented with 15% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum, penicillin/streptomycin (0.5 units/ml and 0.5 mg/ml
respectively) and glucose (6 mg/ml). Cells were maintained at
37°C in a 95% air and 5% CO2
humidified incubator for 12
days. Fresh NM-15 was added every 3­4 days. At the end of
day 12, the mixed cultures were shaken overnight (14­16 h)
at 250 rev./min in order to remove supernatant containing
OLG lineage cells and microglia. To further purify the OLGs,
the supernatant was plated on to uncoated 150 mm
polystyrene dishes at room temperature (22°C) for 90 min
for microglial attachment. OLG lineage cells remaining in the
supernatant were collected, centrifuged at 1000 g at 22°C for
10 min, and plated on to 10 cm poly-D-lysine-coated dishes
at 3.06106 cells per dish. Cells were expanded for 48 h in
NM-15. NM-15 was then replaced with OSFM (OLG serum-
free medium) for 5 days, comprising a 1:1 mix of Ham's F12
(Gibco) and BME (basal medium Eagle; Invitrogen), penicillin/
streptomycin (0.5 units/ml and 0.5 mg/ml respectively), insulin
(25 mg/ml), transferrin (100 mg/ml), putrescine (60 mM),
progesterone (20 nM), selenium (30 nM) and glucose (6 mg/
ml) plus thyroxine (0.5 mM), triiodothyronine (0.08 mg/ml) and
glutamine (1.5 mM). Cultures were highly enriched consisting
of 91% OLG lineage cells with the remaining cells comprising
ED1-positive microglia and GFAP-positive astrocytes.
Neuronal cultures
E17 (embryonic day 17) fetuses were obtained from time-
mated Sprague­Dawley rats. Once the rats were killed by CO2
inhalation, the embryos were removed and the frontal,
cingulate and parietal cortices were dissected, mechanically
dissociated and plated on to 12-well poly-D-lysine-coated
plates at 5.06105 cells per well. Cells were plated in NSFM
(neuron serum-free medium) comprising a 1:1 mixture of
Ham's F12 medium (Gibco) and Eagle's MEM, transferrin (100
mg/ml), insulin (25 mg/ml), selenium (30 nM), putrescine (60
mM), progesterone (20 nM), glucose (6 mg/ml) and penicillin/
streptomycin (0.5 units/ml and 0.5 mg/ml respectively).

OCM (OLG-derived conditioned medium)
To prepare OCM, cortical OLG-enriched cultures were rinsed
three times with PBS to remove the serum. The cultures were
then incubated with OSFM for 5 days. To evaluate the effect
of OCM on neuronal cultures, OSFM (1 part OSFM/1 part
NSFM) or OCM (1 part OCM/1 part NSFM) was added to the
cultures for 5 days. To specifically evaluate the role of BDNF
in OCM, a neutralizing anti-BDNF antibody (Promega) was
pre-incubated for 2 h (at 4°C) with OCM before adding the
mixture to neuronal cultures.
Culture treatments
Before drug treatment of cultures, OLGs grown in OSFM for 5
days were washed twice with PBS. MEM (5 ml) was added to
each of two dishes (10 cm diameter), which were combined
for each control and treatment group. When cultures were
treated with antagonist, the antagonist or vehicle was added
in OSFM for the time specified. The agonist was then added
alone or with antagonist in MEM for 10 min.
Treated and control media were collected and concen-
trated to 50 ml at the same time and in an identical manner,
using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Devices 5 kDa (Millipore) or
Vivaspin 20, 5000 MWCO (Sartorius Biolab Products; MWCO
is molecular weight cut-off). BDNF levels were evaluated by
ELISA or Western blot analysis. Owing to the variability within
the controls of individual experiments, each treatment
condition was compared with its own control within the
same experiment.
ELISA
ELISA was performed using the BDNF Emax ImmunoAssay
System kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
Western blot analysis
BDNF release
Media from ACPD [trans-(1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-
dicarboxylic acid]- or vehicle-treated OLGs were collected
and concentrated as indicated above. Equal volumes of
concentrate (25 ml) were subjected to electrophoresis using
NuPAGE 12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and were transferred
to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore). BDNF in
the membrane was detected using an anti-BDNF antibody
(1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL (enhanced
chemiluminescence; PerkinElmer).
Activated caspase 3
Treatment medium was removed after 10 min, plates were
washed three times in PBS and OSFM was added for an
additional 24 h. OLGs were harvested and lysed in buffer
containing EDTA (10 mM), EGTA (2 mM), SDS (0.1%), CHAPS
(1%), Nonidet P40 (0.5%), Triton X-100 (1%), Tris/HCl (50
mM), NaCl (150 mM), leupeptin (10 mg/ml), aprotinin (10 mg/
ml), soyabean trypsin inhibitor (20 mg/ml), NaF (50 mM), PMSF
(1 mM), microcystin (0.5 mM) and Na3
VO4
(0.5 mM). The cell
debris was centrifuged and the supernatant was collected.
The protein concentration was determined using the BCA
(bicinchoninic acid) protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific).
Proteins were subjected to electrophoresis using a 12%
NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel and transferred as described above. The
membrane was stained with an activated anti-(caspase 3)
antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) and protein was
detected using ECL. To normalize for loading, the same blots
were stripped and evaluated for GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase) protein levels using an anti-
GAPDH antibody (1:1000; Biodesign). Western blot bands
were quantified densitometrically using Quantity One 4.2.1
software and Universal Hood Gel Documentation Systems
(Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Immunocytochemistry
OLGs were fixed in 4% (w/v) PFA (paraformaldehyde) for 1 h
at room temperature. Glutamate receptors were evaluated
using antibodies (1:200) against mGluR1 (where mGluR is
metabotropic glutamate receptor), mGluR2/3, mGluR5,
GluR6/7 (Upstate), GluR1­4 and NR3A (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). VGLUT1(+) neurons were detected using
anti-VGLUT1 antibody (1:5000; Chemicon). Vesicular proteins
were evaluated using anti-(secretogranin II) antibody
[1:1000; a gift from Dr Tsuyoshi Watanabe (Department of
Anatomy, Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa, Japan)],
using the methods as described in Sakai et al. (2003), anti-
(chromogranin A) (1:200; Dako) or anti-VAMP2 (vesicle-
associated membrane protein 2, 1:200; Synaptic Systems)
antibodies. Immunopositive cells were detected using the ABC
(avidin--biotin complex) kit (Vector laboratories), and DAB
(diaminobenzidine) precipitation (Sigma). Negative staining
controls were treated identically, but received no primary
antibody.
Quantification
VGLUT1(+) neurons
VGLUT1(+) cell numbers were determined by counting
random fields within each well of 12-well plates under a
phase-bright microscope. The region counted represented 6%
of the well surface area or 20 mm2. Since the number of
VGLUT1 cells varied in controls from experiment to
experiment, each treatment group was expressed as a
percentage of its own control within the same experiment.
Glutamate- and ACPD-treated OLGs
Numbers were determined by counting OLG-like cells in

2.5% of the well surface area or 9 mm2. Each treatment
group was expressed as a percentage of its own control
within the same experiment.
Treatment drugs used
The general mGluR agonist ACPD, the Group I mGluR agonist,
DHPG [(RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine], the Group II mGluR
agonist, DCG-IV [(2S,29R,39R)-2-(29,39-dicarboxycyclopropyl)-
glycine], the general mGluR antagonist, MCPG [(S)-a-methyl-
4-carboxyphenylglycine], the PLC inhibitor U73122 and the
IP3
(inositol trisphosphate) receptor antagonist 2-APB (2-
aminoethoxydiphenylborane) were purchased from Tocris.
Glutamate, kainate, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), the
calcium chelator, BAPTA/AM [1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-
ethane-N,N,N9,N9-tetra-acetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl
ester)] and the PLC agonist m-3M3FBS [N-(3-trifluoromethyl-
phenyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonamide], were purchased
from Sigma. U73122, 2-APB, BAPTA/AM and m-3M3FBS were
dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). Their respective
control cultures were treated identically, with DMSO added
to MEM as a vehicle. Doses for each drug and times of
pretreatment were determined by dose­response and time of
action experiments.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was determined using a paired
Student's t test or ANOVA and a Fisher's test as appropriate
using StatView 5.0.1 software.
RESULTS
Effects of OCM-derived BDNF on the numbers of
VGLUT1(+) glutamatergic cortical neurons
BDNF influences the development and survival of cortical
neurons (Barnabe-Heider and Miller, 2003; Liu et al., 2003;
Bartkowska et al., 2007). Moreover, BDNF derived from BF
OLGs enhances the survival of proximate neurons (Dai et al.,
2003). To determine whether BDNF derived from cortical
OLGs has similar actions, we evaluated the effects of OCM on
the numbers of VGLUT1(+) neurons. These neurons represent
one population of glutamate-producing neurons in the
cortex (Fremeau et al., 2004; Liguz-Lecznar and Skangiel-
Kramska, 2007) and are reported to express TrkB in culture
(Swanwick et al., 2004; Gomes et al., 2006). OCM elicited an
increase in VGLUT(+) neurons, that was reduced in the
presence of neutralizing anti-BDNF antibody, suggesting that
BDNF in OCM is trophic to VGLUT1(+) glutamatergic neurons
(Figure 1).
OLGs express vesicular proteins and respond to
glutamate by releasing BDNF
Since BDNF secreted by OLGs is trophic to glutamate-
producing cells, we considered whether glutamate may
influence the release of BDNF from OLGs. Neurons and
astrocytes, which release BDNF in response to glutamate,
express vesicular proteins associated with regulated release
(Hepp and Langley, 2001; Montana et al., 2006). Some of
these proteins are reported in OLGs and are thought to be
involved in myelin assembly (Madison et al., 1996, 1999;
Larocca and Rodriguez-Gabin, 2002; Sloane and Vartanian,
2007; Feldmann et al., 2009; Schardt et al., 2009). Cortical
OLGs in our cultures similarly exhibited VAMP2, in addition to
chromogranin A and secretrogranin II (Figure 2A), suggesting
that cortical OLGs may possess the capacity for regulated
release of BDNF. To evaluate whether regulated release occurs
in OLGs, cortical OLGs were treated for 10 min with
glutamate (100 mM) and BDNF in the medium was assayed.
Levels of BDNF were elevated in the medium (Figure 2B),
indicating that glutamate may regulate the release of BDNF
from OLGs.
mGluRs mediate BDNF release
Glutamate acting though ionotropic receptors mediates
BDNF release from Schwann cells (Verderio et al., 2006)
and, through mGluRs and ionotropic receptors, may
mediate release from neurons and astrocytes (Canossa et
al., 2001; Bergami et al., 2008; Jean et al., 2009). To
determine which glutamate receptor may mediate release
in OLGs, we first evaluated the receptors present. When
evaluated immunocytochemically, OLGs were found to

express ionotropic receptors. Receptor subunits of kainate
and AMPA, as well as NMDA receptors, were detected
(Figure 3A). Moveover, both Group I (mGluR1 and 5) and
Group II (mGluR 2/3) mGluRs were identified on the cells
(Figure 3B).
To determine which receptors may influence OLGs, cells
grown for 5 days in OSFM were treated for 10 min with
kainate (200 mM), NMDA (100 mM) or ACPD (10 mM), an
agonist that stimulates Group I and Group II mGluRs. Neither
kainate nor NMDA had any effect on BDNF release as
determined by ELISA (Figures 4A and 4B). However, ACPD
increased the amount of BDNF secreted into the medium
within 10 min of stimulation (Figure 4C). Similar results were
obtained by Western blot analysis (Figure 4D), suggesting
that in cortical OLGs, metabotropic, but not ionotropic,
glutamate receptors mediate release.
To further confirm mediation by mGluRs, the effects of
MCPG, a Group I and Group II metabotropic antagonist, was
evaluated. MCPG (300 mM) inhibited the actions of
glutamate, confirming the involvement of mGluRs in
elevating extracellular BDNF (Figure 4E).
ACPD is an agonist for both Group I and Group II mGluRs.
To determine which group mediates release, we used the
Group I-specific agonist DHPG and the Group II-specific
agonist DCG-IV. Stimulation of OLGs for 10 min with DHPG
(100 mM), but not DCG-IV (10 mM), increased extracellular
BDNF (Figure 5), suggesting that the release of BDNF occurs
through the activation of Group I mGluRs and not Group II
mGluRs.

Metabotropic-mediated release occurs through
the PLC pathway
Group I mGluRs are coupled to the PLC pathway (Chuang et
al., 2001; Hannan et al., 2001; Hermans and Challiss, 2001).
Moreover, stimulation of metabotropic receptors through this
pathway is responsible for the release of BDNF in hippo-
campal neurons (Canossa et al., 2001) and astrocytes (Jean et
al., 2009). Activation of PLC induces the cell membrane
hydrolysis of PIP2
(phosphatidylinositol biphosphate) into IP3
and DAG (diacylglycerol). IP3
then binds to its receptors on
the endoplasmic reticulum causing calcium release.
To evaluate whether the PLC pathway is involved in the
mGluR-mediated effect on BDNF, we used the PLC pathway
activator m-3M3FBS. Stimulation with m-3M3FBS (25 mM for
20 min), induced a 2.5-fold increase in the amount of BDNF
released compared with the control (Figure 6A). Moreover, in
the presence of the PLC inhibitor U73122 (1 mM) the IP3
receptor inhibitor 2-APB (150 mM), and the intracellular
calcium chelator BAPTA/AM (80 mM) ACPD-induced increases
in extracellular BDNF were blocked (Figures 6B­6D), suggest-
ing that the PLC pathway is a critical mediator.
ACPD or glutamate treatment does not activate
caspase 3 or affect cell number
Glutamate has been reported to be toxic to OLGs. The degree
of toxicity depends on the OLG population being evaluated,
the length of glutamate exposure and the receptor subtype
being activated. AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors have
been shown to mediate these toxic effects (Sanchez-Gomez
and Matute, 1999; Fern and Moller, 2000; Deng et al., 2003;
Rosenberg et al., 2003; Wosik et al., 2004; Karadottir et al.,
2005; Salter and Fern, 2005; Deng et al., 2006; Micu et al.,
2006).
To rule out the possibility that the release of BDNF is due to
toxicity, OLGs were treated with glutamate, ACPD or vehicle
control for 10 min and activated caspase 3 levels were
evaluated at 24 h post-stimulation. Caspase 3 is a key
executioner caspase activated during glutamate toxicity
(Sanchez-Gomez et al., 2003). Caspase 3 was not activated in
our cultures and the levels of caspase 3 were not different
among glutamate, ACPD and vehicle control groups. In
contrast, staurosporine, known to activate caspase 3 and used
as a positive control, did activate caspase 3 (Figures 7A and 7B).
In other studies total cell numbers were determined 24 h
post-stimulation. No changes were observed among the
different treatment groups (Figure 7C), suggesting that the
experimental conditions used in the present study do not kill
the OLGs.
DISCUSSION
The present study indicates that cortical OLG-derived BDNF
provides trophic support to proximate neurons in culture. As
such, it complements previous work indicating that cortical,
CC and BF OLGs contain BDNF mRNA in vivo and that BF OLGs
release BDNF that supports proximate BF neurons (Dai et al.,
2003). Moreover, the present study demonstrates that the
release of BDNF is regulated by glutamate in a process
mediated by metabotropic receptors and the PLC pathway. It
is known that OLGs express a host of other growth factors in
vivo and in vitro (da Cunha et al., 1993; McKinnon et al.,
1993; Shinar and McMorris, 1995; Raabe et al., 1997; Hayase
et al., 1998; Strelau and Unsicker, 1999; Dougherty et al.,
2000; Wilkins et al., 2001; Dai et al., 2003; Wilkins et al.,

2003) and that some of these, when released from OLG
lineage cells, support neurons (Wilkins et al., 2001, 2003).
However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
that release of BDNF, or any trophic factor released from OLGs,
can be regulated within 10 min of stimulation. The studies
suggest that OLGs may release such substances in a manner
critically sensitive to glutamate and possibly neurostimulation.
OLGs are responsive to neuronal signals
That OLGs are responsive to neuronal signals is consistent
with a rich literature which indicates that neurons can
regulate OLG lineage cells throughout development. Thus it
has been known for some time that optic nerve transection
results in loss of OLG progenitors and mature OLGs (David et
al., 1984), and elimination of electrical activity of retinal
ganglion cells or transection of the optic nerve results in
decreases in progenitor proliferation (Barres and Raff,
1993).
Moreover, a variety of ion channels have been detected in
OLG lineage cells (Barres et al., 1988, 1989, 1990; Kettenmann
et al., 1991), as well as neurotransmitter receptors (Patneau et
al., 1994; Ghiani et al., 1999; Ragheb et al., 2001; Rogers et
al., 2001; Stevens et al., 2002; Luyt et al., 2003; Deng et al.,
2004; Karadottir and Attwell, 2007; Luyt et al., 2007).
Responses to transmitter substances are now being defined.
For example, with respect to glutamate, OLG precursors lying
in close proximity to synaptic specializations of hippocampal
(Bergles et al., 2000) or callosal axons (Ziskin et al., 2007) are
responsive to glutamate released from these sites. Culture

studies reveal that AMPA/kainate and metabotropic receptors
mediate the influx of calcium (Butt and Tutton, 1992;
Patneau et al., 1994; Liu et al., 1997; Luyt et al., 2006).
Glutamate, through ionotropic receptors, inhibits prolifera-
tion and stimulates OLG progenitor migration (Liu and
Almazan, 1995; Gallo et al., 1996; Gudz et al., 2006). It may
also stimulate death (Yoshioka et al., 1995; Matute et al.,
1997). Metabotropic receptors are found prominently on
young OLGs (Deng et al., 2004; Luyt et al., 2006).
Interestingly, with respect to the present study, stimulation
of these metabotropic receptors limits AMPA/kainate recep-
tor-mediated OLG cell death and excitotoxicity (Kelland and
Toms, 2001; Deng et al., 2004; Luyt et al., 2006), suggesting
that these receptors may mediate a protective role.
The release of BDNF in response to glutamate is
consistent with responses of neurons and
astrocytes
In the present study we report that the release of BDNF is
dependent on metabotropic receptors and the PLC pathway,
which results in the mobilization of calcium from intracellular
stores. Although ionotropic receptors are present on the
OLGs, they do not appear to mediate release since neither
stimulation with kainate nor NMDA elicited release. In
contrast, treatment with the mGluR agonist, ACPD, resulted
in an increase in extracellular BDNF and the effects of
glutamate were completely abolished by the mGluR ant-
agonist, MCPG. These studies complement others using
neurons and astrocytes which suggest that, in other cells,
glutamate and mGluRs are involved in the release of several
factors, including neurotrophins (Bruno et al., 1998; Ciccarelli
et al., 1999; Canossa et al., 2001; Jean et al., 2009). Moreover,
where it was studied, release of BDNF through mGluRs was
dependent on the PLC pathway and the mobilization of
calcium (Canossa et al., 2001; Jean et al., 2009).
Cortical OLGs are reported to express a variety of vesicular
proteins (Madison et al., 1996, 1999; Sloane and Vartanian,
2007; Feldmann et al., 2009; Schardt et al., 2009), many of
which are developmentally regulated and may play a role in
the regulation of myelin assembly (Larocca and Rodriguez-
Gabin, 2002; Feldmann et al., 2009; Schardt et al., 2009).
However, the presence of these proteins in OLGs in the
present study suggests that they may also be capable of
controlling the regulated secretion of BDNF seen previously in
neurons and glial cells (Canossa et al., 2001; Hartmann et al.,
2001; Brigadski et al., 2005; Verderio et al., 2006; Bergami et
al., 2008; Jean et al., 2009). Although it has yet to be
determined whether BDNF is associated with these or any
other vesicular proteins in OLGs, VAMP2, secretogranin II and
chromogranin A are associated with BDNF storage, trafficking
and release. For example, BDNF was found to co-localize with
chromogranin A in transfected AtT-20 cells, a mouse pituitary
cell line (Goodman et al., 1996), and with secretogranin II in
hippocampal neurons (Egan et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2004). In
Schwann cells (Verderio et al., 2006) and astrocytes (Bergami
et al., 2008) BDNF release is inhibited by tetanus toxin,
illustrating a VAMP2-dependent mechanism. Interestingly,
however, in Schwann cells glutamate induces release in a
process dependent on ionotropic glutamate receptors
(Verderio et al, 2006), suggesting differences in BDNF release
in peripheral compared with central glia, although the role of
metabotropic receptors was not examined.
Significance for the neuron­glia interaction in
vivo
Previous studies indicate that BF OLG-derived conditioned
media applied to the BF cholinergic neurons enhances
survival and function of these cells (Dai et al., 2003). The
observed effects were partly due to BDNF, as neutralizing
Figure 7 Treatment of OLGs with glutamate (100 mM) or ACPD (10 mM)

(A) Western blot analysis of cell lysates at 24 h post-stimulation reveals no
change in activated (Act.) caspase 3 levels in control vehicle (ctrl), glutamate

positive control (strspo). (B) Densitometric analysis of three independent

antibodies blocked trophic activity (Dai et al., 2003). The
present study extends this observation to the cortex, by
showing that cortical OCM applied to embryonic cortical
neurons increased the numbers of VGLUT1(+) glutamatergic
neurons, a result also dependent on BDNF. Others have
implicated OLG-derived GDNF and IGF-1 as having similar
roles (Wilkins et al., 2001, 2003). The results suggest that
OLGs from multiple brain regions may provide support to
proximate neurons.
Although these studies have been performed in culture,
they may have bearing on situations in vivo. OLGs and their
associated neurons are affected in a number of degenerative
diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease
(Ferguson et al., 1997; Trapp et al., 1998; Jellinger and
Stadelmann, 2001; Sjobeck et al., 2005). Signals that underlie
the cross-talk between neurons and OLGs remain poorly
understood. The roles of integrins, the Notch and Jagged cell­
cell interacting pathway, and growth factors in mediating
OLG­neuron interactions during normal development and
injury, are actively being explored (Wilkins et al., 2001, 2003;
Bozzali and Wrabetz, 2004; Baron et al., 2005; Laursen and
Ffrench-Constant, 2007). Our finding that OLGs may provide
trophic support to their nearby neurons through the actions
of NTs and neurotransmitters suggest another mechanism
that may underlie this interaction. BDNF is an important
modulator of survival and development (Alderson et al., 1990;
Hyman et al., 1991; Friedman et al., 1993; Bartkowska et al.,
2007) and mGluRs are protective to both neurons and OLGs
following injury (Koh et al., 1991; Schroder et al., 1999; Deng
et al., 2004). Continued understanding of this glutamate­
BDNF cross-talk may provide an approach with which to
enhance the viability of both OLG and proximate neurons
damaged in a host of degenerative diseases of the CNS.
