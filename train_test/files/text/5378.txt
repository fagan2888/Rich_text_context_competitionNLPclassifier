Abstract
The critical years hypothesis is an influential hypothesis in the social sciences. According to this hypothesis,
events occurring during adolescence or young adulthood are most important. This hypothesis is significant
because if generations do indeed differ from each other because they were socialized in different contexts,
the succession of generations has the potential to change societies. In this study, we test the validity of the
critical years hypothesis using data from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences Immigrant
Panel. We first compare the power of the critical years hypothesis to that of alternative patterns, after
which we conduct a structural examination of the conditionality of the critical years hypothesis. We test
our hypotheses according to both open-ended and closed-ended questions. The results provide only limited
evidence for the critical years hypothesis.

Introduction
History has known countless events like wars, crises, political murderers, terrorist attacks, demon-
strations, processes of colonization (and de-colonization), immigration, emancipation and
supranational collaboration. Each of these happenings has played some role in shaping current
society. Some are remembered, while others are collectively forgotten (Zerubavel, 2003). There
could be substantial differences within societies regarding the historical events that are considered

important.1 Many studies have focused on how generations, each socialized under unique societal
conditions, differ regarding their view on history (e.g. Griffin, 2004; Roberts and Lang, 1985).
According to many scholars, events occurring during adolescence or young adulthood (approxi-
mately 17­25years old) are considered the most important (Mannheim, 1952). This hypothesis ­
known as the critical years hypothesis2 ­ has been very influential. This is not surprising, given its
major societal implications. If generations do indeed differ significantly from each other because
they were socialized in different contexts, the succession of generations has the potential to change
societies. In this study, we test the validity of the influential critical years hypothesis according to
the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences Immigrant Panel (LISS-I panel).
As many other European countries have similar histories and commemoration cultures, the
Netherlands is a representative case upon which to test the validity of the critical years hypothesis
(Krimp et al., 2014).
Previous studies on the critical years hypothesis have been exaggerated to the point of ignoring
contrary development patterns (Jennings and Niemi, 1968). We therefore start this study by formu-
lating and empirically testing hypotheses for alternative age patterns. More specifically, in addition
to the critical years hypothesis, we test the living-in-history hypothesis,3 which predicts that all age
cohorts living during a specific event will be influenced by this event. In contrast to the critical
years hypothesis, the living-in-history hypothesis does not regard the formative period as excep-
tional. We also test the keeping-history-alive hypothesis, which predicts that all age cohorts will
consider a specific event important, regardless of whether they had lived through it. This age
cohorts pattern can be expected for events that are frequently commemorated in a nation's media
and/or educational system (Koppel, 2013).
In the second part of this study, we examine the importance of age, as compared to other demo-
graphic factors, in explaining intra-national variation in the importance attached to historical events.
Schwartz (1999) argues that, in addition to its developmental aspects (i.e. related to age), the critical
period has social aspects. The consequentiality of historical events differs from social group to social
group (Brown and Kulik, 1977). Structural differences are therefore likely to occur between groups
with regard to the historical events that are considered important (McKeever et al., 1993). In this study,
we examine gender differences and differences between natives and immigrants regarding the impor-
tance attached to historical events. Although several studies on collective memory have included such
aspects as control variables (e.g. Scott and Zac, 1993), they rarely focus explicitly on the influence of
such aspects on which historical events are considered important (for notable exceptions, see, for
example, Schuman et al., 2003). In this study, we will test the extent to which these demographic
aspects are more strongly related to the importance attached to historical events than is age.
The third part of our study explores whether the validity of the critical years hypothesis is con-
ditional (i.e. whether the critical years are important only for certain groups). For example, suppose
that, in general, the process of women's emancipation is not more important for individuals who
were in their critical years during this process than it is for those who were not in their critical years
at that time. It could be that women who were in their critical years were strongly influenced by
this process, while men were not. In other words, the critical years hypothesis would be valid for
women, but not for men. Limiting the analysis to the general effect of the critical years might gen-
erate biased conclusions concerning the validity of the critical years. A good overview of the valid-
ity of the critical years hypothesis requires studying its validity for different groups. Despite
fragmented information suggesting such conditionality for the critical years hypothesis (e.g.
Jennings and Zhang, 2005), this issue has tended to be tested only sporadically and, in most cases,
yielding only descriptive evidence. For this reason, this study includes a more systematic examina-
tion of the extent to which the influence of critical years on the importance attached to historical
events depends upon educational level and gender.
de Regt et al. 3
Finally, our study draws upon both open-ended and closed-ended questions. The open-ended
question requires the respondent to bring to mind a range of alternatives and mention only one or
two, while the closed-ended question lists a number of historical events and respondents can indi-
cate that multiple events are (equally) important. Most studies on critical years use open-ended
questions (e.g. Corning and Schuman, 2015). Nevertheless, it has been suggested that conclusions
concerning the validity of the critical years hypothesis might depend upon the type of questions
used: the critical years hypothesis is more often confirmed using open-ended questions than closed-
ended questions (Corning and Schuman, 2015; Koppel, 2013). In order to test the validity of the
critical years hypothesis thoroughly, it is therefore important to employ open-ended questions as
well as closed-ended questions.
In sum, by (1) formulating and testing competing hypotheses on the relationship between age
and the importance attached to historical events, (2) examining the importance of age relative to
other demographic factors, (3) structurally examining the conditionality of the critical years and
(4) employing both open-ended and closed-ended questions, this study provides deeper insight into
the relationship between critical years and the importance attached to historical events.
Generational differences and the importance of historical events
Critical years hypothesis. The work of Karl Mannheim (1952) is often taken as a starting point for an
enquiry involving generations. He theorized that events occurring during adolescence have more
impact, given their major advantage of primacy (the idea that first experiences are generally more
important than subsequent experiences) and the relative openness of young adults to new events.
Schuman and colleagues have conducted extensive study on generational differences in memories
of public events (e.g. Schuman and Corning, 2012; Schuman and Rodgers, 2004; Schuman and
Scott, 1989). In many studies, they conclude that different generations recall different events and
that such memories do tend to come from adolescence and early adulthood. For example, in their
pioneering study, Schuman and Scott (1989) report that individuals who were between 16 and
24years of age during the Second World War were more likely to identify this war as the most
important event in modern history. Similar generational differences have been reported with regard
to memories of the Vietnam War, the Iran hostage-taking and subsequent acts of terrorism, and the
assassination of John F. Kennedy. Scott and Zac (1993) examine the importance of national and
international events during a period of immense historical change: the fall of the Berlin Wall and
the more general collapse of communist regimes. These dramatic changes did not have the same
impact on older cohorts that they did on younger cohorts. The memories of older people were still
dominated by wartime events from their youth (mainly the Second World War). Based on the
extensive literature concerning the critical years hypothesis (see Corning and Schuman, 2015, for
a more complete overview), events are likely to be considered most important by people who expe-
rienced them during their critical years:
Hypothesis 1a. People who experienced an event during their critical years consider this event
more important than do people who did not experience it during their critical years.
Living-in-history hypothesis. As outlined above, several studies have provided empirical evidence for
the critical years hypothesis. Nevertheless, other studies have reported findings that undermine the
validity of this hypothesis (e.g. Corning, 2010; Jennings and Zhang, 2005). One competing hypoth-
esis is that important events are not only those that occur during the formative years but all events
that individuals experience, regardless of the age at which they take place (Koppel, 2013). As
personally experienced events generally cause more arousal than do those that have not been
4 Memory Studies 00(0)
personally experienced, personally experienced events are likely to be considered more important
than other events are (Gold, 1992). The living-in-history hypothesis4 does not regard the critical
period as exceptional. Such age distributions are especially likely for events that exert a particu-
larly strong impact on a country's day-to-day life at the time they occur (Koppel, 2013). Many
previous studies on the living-in-history hypothesis examined the extent to which historical events
influence autobiographical memory (e.g. Brown et al., 2009). Although the focus of such studies is
slightly different, the main idea ­ that public events that exerted a particularly strong impact on a
country's day-to-day life at the time they occurred are important to all persons who consciously
experienced these events ­ can also be used to study the general importance attached to historical
events. Several studies on the importance attached to historical events have shown that an event is
considered important by all citizens living at the time it occurs, and that date of birth has little or
no effect (Corning, 2010; Jennings and Zhang, 2005; Schuman et al., 2003). For example, Chinese
citizens perceive the general reforms and openings to the outside world (from the late 1970s) as the
most important process of modern history, regardless of age (Jennings and Zhang, 2005). The col-
lapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 has also been found to be equally important to all Russian immi-
grants in the United States. Older generations of immigrants do not differ from Russian immigrants
who experienced the end of the Soviet Union in their formative years (Corning, 2010). According
to another study, memories of the Six-Day War in Israel were equally distributed across all age
cohorts living at the time of this war (Schuman et al., 2003). These findings suggest that all age
cohorts that consciously experience an event consider this event important and that the critical
years do not constitute an exceptional period in this regard:
Hypothesis 1b. People who consciously experienced an event consider this event more impor-
tant than people who did not consciously experience the event, and people who experienced the
event during their critical years do not consider it more important than people who experienced
the event before or after their critical years.
Keeping-history-alive hypothesis. Koppel (2013) argues the possibility of another age pattern in con-
trast to the critical years and living-in-history hypotheses. More specifically, some events are likely
to be considered equally important by all age cohorts, regardless of whether they had lived through
it. This age pattern is likely to emerge for events that are actively commemorated in the national
media and/or in the educational system. In the Netherlands, for example, this age pattern could be
expected for the Second World War. The two national days of commemoration in the Netherlands
­ 4 May (Remembrance Day) and 5 May (Liberation Day) ­ were developed in direct response to
this war, which continues to play a central role in these two national commemorations (De Regt
et al., 2017). Moreover, knowledge about the world wars and the Holocaust has been identified as
one of the key goals of primary education in the Netherlands.5 The Second World War is thus
actively commemorated in the Netherlands, both in the educational system and by means of annual
national commemorations. As a result, we might expect age cohorts in the Netherlands not to differ
significantly from each other with regard to the importance they attach to the Second World War. In
other words, we expect that if an event is actively commemorated, age cohorts that did not experi-
ence this event do not consider this event less important than cohorts that did experience the event:
Hypothesis 1c. People who consciously experienced an explicitly commemorated event do not
consider this event to be more important than do people who did not experience the event.
The relationships between age cohorts and the importance attached to events according to the
three hypotheses (critical years, living-in-history and keeping-history-alive) are illustrated in
Figure 1.

Influence of other demographic factors on the importance of historical events
Gender and the importance of historical events. It has been argued that the critical period is not only
developmental (related to age) but also social (Schwartz, 1999). In general, events that are com-
memorated and remembered are those that embody our deepest and most fundamental values
(Schwartz, 1982). In other words, historical events that are important to the (group) identity of
specific groups are particularly likely to be remembered by members of those groups. Furthermore,
the impact that historical events have on personal lives can differ between groups (Bohn and
Habermas, 2016; Zebian and Brown, 2014). Women's emancipation arguably changed the identity
and societal position of many women. The process of emancipation changed the expectation that
women should be the sole caretakers of children and housekeeping, while men were considered
more suitable to working outdoors. It became acceptable for women to pursue higher education,
and they gained rights regarding their bodies and sexuality (e.g. abortion laws). The historical
emancipation of women might thus be more important to the identity of women than it is to the
identity of men and therefore considered more important by the former group. Based on an open-
ended question, Schuman and Scott (1989) found that women are indeed more likely than men to
mention women's rights as the most important change occurring the past 50years. We can there-
fore expect women to judge the process of emancipation as more important than men do:
Hypothesis 2a: The emancipation of women is considered more important by women than it is
by men.
Ethnicity and the importance of events.As outlined above, it has been argued that historical events
that are important to the identity of groups and/or have a strong impact on the personal lives of group
members are particularly likely to be remembered (Bohn and Habermas, 2016; Brown and Kulik,
1977; Zebian and Brown, 2014). We could therefore expect different ethnic groups to consider dif-
ferent historical events important. Several studies have provided evidence of differences in the ways
in which Blacks and Whites (or immigrants and natives) view the past. For example, Schuman et al.
(1997) report that Black respondents knew more about Rosa Parks (the Black women who protested
racial segregation by refusing to move to the back of the bus) than White respondents did, while the
situation was reversed for knowledge about other historical events (e.g. the Marshall plan, the Tet

offensive and Watergate). Other studies have also shown that race is significantly associated with
the likelihood of identifying the civil rights movement and the election of Barack Obama as most
important event in modern history, with Blacks attaching more value to these events than Whites do
(Corning and Schuman, 2013; Schuman and Rodgers, 2004). In this article, we examine historical
events related to specific ethnic groups (e.g. the decolonization of Suriname and the arrival of Turk-
ish and Moroccan guest workers), predicting that immigrants are generally more likely to consider
them important than native Dutch people are:
Hypothesis 2b. Events related to specific ethnic groups are considered more important by mem-
bers of these groups than they are by natives.
Conditionality of the critical years period
Fragmented evidence exists to support the idea that the critical years are especially influential dur-
ing certain circumstances or for special groups (e.g. Schuman et al., 1997; Schuman and Scott,
1989). For example, studies have shown that the influence of the formative period can differ by
gender. In a study on collective memory in Russia, Schuman and Corning (2000) examine knowl-
edge of Katya Lycheva, an 11-year-old Soviet girl who travelled to the United States during the
Cold War with the peace mission. The results indicated that girls in their formative years were
particularly knowledgeable about this event. Similarly, Schuman et al. (1997) demonstrate that
men who were young during the Tet offensive were particularly well informed about this cam-
paign. The fact that they knew more than either women of the same age or older men can be
explained by the fact that young men were the most threatened during the Tet offensive, as they
were of military age. Less evidence exists on interactions between age and educational level.
Schuman and Scott (1989) report no evidence of interactions between age and educational level in
yielding memories of events. It is nevertheless plausible that the influence of the critical period
depends upon educational level. The critical years hypothesis predicts that events occurring during
adolescence and young adulthood are particularly likely to be considered important. This is likely
to be especially true for those with higher levels of education. In general, people with more educa-
tion are more capable of recognizing the uniqueness and impact of events (Schuman and Rodgers,
2004), and young adults with a higher level of education should thus be particularly likely to be
influenced by events occurring during their formative years. In short, several studies provide evi-
dence that the critical years hypothesis is conditional. Much of this evidence is descriptive and ad
hoc, referring to only limited number of events. In this study, we conduct an explorative, system-
atic test of the conditionality of the critical years hypothesis on educational level and/or gender.
Method
Participants
To test the validity of the critical years hypothesis, we use data from the Longitudinal Internet
Studies for the Social Sciences Immigrant Panel (LISS-I panel) administered by CentERdata
(Tilburg University, the Netherlands). In this Dutch panel, immigrants are oversampled in order to
allow for the reliable investigation of differences between immigrant groups in the importance
attached to historical events. Households that would otherwise have been unable to participate in
the panel are provided with a computer and/or Internet connection. Panel members complete an
online questionnaire monthly, being paid for each completed questionnaire. Data for this study
were collected in April 2014. In all, 1325 individuals participated in the study, for a response rate
de Regt et al. 7
of 77.7%. The youngest respondent in our sample was 16years old and the oldest respondent was
89 years old (M=47.57, standard deviation (SD)=16.55).
Measures
Importance of events. In this study, we employed an open-ended question as well as a closed-ended
question to measure the importance attached to historical events. Both formats have advantages
and disadvantages. It is known, for example, that open-ended questions are generally less leading
and can produce unanticipated findings, while closed-ended questions are generally easier for
respondents to answer and respondents' answers are easier to compare (Neuman, 2012). As the
two methods are related, but different, both methods were used in this study in order to study the
importance attached to historical events thoroughly.
Importance of events ­ open-ended ­ The respondents first answered the open-ended question
about the importance of historical events: Many national and international events and changes
have occurred in the last 70 years. Can you list 1 or 2 events or changes which you think were
particularly important? Similar questions have been employed successfully in most other studies
on the critical years hypothesis (e.g. Corning and Schuman, 2015). Consistent with these studies,
we combined first and second mentions. This is a measure not only of recall but also of perceived
importance, as it can be assumed that respondents mention the events they consider to be most
important. It was technically impossible for the respondents to return to this question after answer-
ing it. This method prevented any bias resulting from respondents changing their answers after
seeing the historical events presented in the closed-ended question.
Importance of events ­ closed-ended ­ The respondents subsequently answered the closed-
ended question on the importance of historical events: Below is a list of events and changes that
occurred in the last 70 years. Please indicate for each event and change how important you con-
sider this to have been (1 = not at all important and 10 = very important). If you really don't know,
then you can choose `?'. (1) The arrival of Turkish and Moroccan guest workers, (2) The assassina-
tions of Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh, (3) The independence of Indonesia, (4) The establish-
ment of social security (e.g. the General Old Age Pensions Act and the Social Welfare Act), (5) The
independence of Suriname, (6) The terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2011, (7)
The Second World War, (8) The fall of the enclave of Srebrenica in Bosnia, (9) The fall of the
Berlin Wall and (10) Women's emancipation/feminism. The events were presented in random
order, thus preventing biases resulting from the sequence in which the events were presented. We
also consciously included important events from different historical periods. Figure 2 shows when
the events in question took place.
Such a closed-ended question has rarely been employed by studies examining the validity of the
critical years hypothesis. Studies that did use closed-ended questions to test the validity of the criti-
cal years hypothesis often used knowledge measures (e.g. Janssen et al., 2008; Rubin et al., 1998).
In our study, however, we are interested in the importance attached to historical events. It is
Figure 2. Chronological order of events.
8 Memory Studies 00(0)
possible that people have knowledge of historical events (e.g. because of commemorations in the
media and/or the educational system), but do not consider this event important. In our study, we
therefore chose to employ another closed-ended question to examine the importance attached to
historical events. For excellent reviews of previous studies on the importance attached to historical
events as well as the distinction between the two question formats, the interested reader is referred
to Koppel (2013) and Corning and Schuman (2015).
Age-cohorts ­ In order to be able to test our hypotheses, we empirically distinguished between
four age cohorts: (1) people who did not consciously experience the event, (2) people who experi-
enced the event before their critical years, (3) people who experienced the event during their critical
years and (4) people who experienced the event after their critical years. The first category ­ people
who did not consciously experience the event ­ consisted of people who had not been born when the
event occurred and people who were in early childhood. More specifically, we set the boundary at
5years old, as in general most adults cannot remember events that happened prior to the age of 5
(see Erikson, 1950, on the developmental stages of children and Rubin et al., 1986, on childhood
amnesia). Therefore, it can be expected that both people who had not yet been born and people aged
under 5years old did not consciously experience the event. In line with many previous studies (e.g.
Corning and Schuman, 2015), we define the critical period as being between the ages of 17 and
25
years. This means that in our study, individuals who experienced an event before their critical
years were between 5 and 16years of age when the event occurred, and people who experienced the
event after their critical years were over 25years old when the event took place.6
Gender ­ Gender was assessed by the dummy variable `Female' (1 = female and 0 = male). In
our sample, 53.7% were female and 46.3% were male.
Immigrant status ­ We used five dummy variables to measure ethnicity: Turkish (5.1%),
Moroccan (5.8%), Surinamese (4.8%), other non-Western immigrants (24.5%) and Western immi-
grants (26.2%). Native Dutch respondents (33.2%) were the reference category.
Procedure
In this study, we first compare the validity of the critical years hypothesis to two competing age
patterns (i.e. the living-in-history hypothesis and the keeping-history-alive hypothesis). More spe-
cifically, we compare (1) the mean importance attached to historical events (derived from the
closed-ended question) across age cohorts by means of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and (2)
differences across age cohorts in the percentage of mentioning a specific event (derived from the
open-ended question) by means of chi-square tests. Second, we compare the explanatory power of
age to other demographic aspects (i.e. gender and ethnicity). To examine the effect of age com-
pared to gender and ethnicity using the closed-ended question on the importance of historical
events, we use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Logistic regression is used to analyse the
open-ended questions on the importance of historical events, as mentioning an event has only two
categories (mentioned = 1 and not mentioned = 0). We report standardized coefficients, as this
allows us to compare the strength of the effect of age on the importance attached to historical
events compared to other demographic factors.7 Third, we use interaction terms to test the condi-
tionality of the critical years hypothesis. More specifically, interaction terms are created between
the critical years and educational level and gender. Unfortunately, the data did not contain responses
from enough immigrants to test interactions between age cohort and ethnic background.
Results
Before examining the extent of variation within Dutch society, we examine which events are gen-
erally considered most important according to respondents in the Netherlands. In Table 1, we
de Regt et al. 9
present descriptive statistics on the items concerning the importance of historical events (the
closed-ended question) and in Table 2, we present the events that were mentioned most often as
important historical events (the open-ended question).8
As indicated in Tables 1 and 2, the Second World War was identified as the most important his-
torical event by respondents in the Netherlands (according to both the open-ended and the closed-
ended question). Other events that were identified as important include the 9/11 terror attacks and
the fall of the Berlin Wall. Although the respondents also identified the establishment of social
security as important based on the closed-ended question (M=8.14, Min.=1, Max.=10), only a few
respondents (0.9%) mentioned this in the open-ended question. Another interesting difference is the
relatively large number of respondents mentioning the coronation of Willem-Alexander as one of
the most important events in history. This result is likely due to the `recency effect'(O'Connor et al.,
2000), given that this event occurred 1year before our data were collected.
Age and importance attached to historical events. Table 3 shows the mean importance attached to
historical events (derived from the closed-ended question) for different age cohorts. As we can see,
the results are not in line with the critical years hypothesis. Respondents who experienced the
arrival of Turkish and Moroccan guest workers, the emancipation of women, the independence of
Suriname, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the fall of the enclave of Srebrenica, the terrorist attacks on
the United States on 11 September 2011 and the assassinations of Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh
during their critical years do not consider these events significantly more important than do people
who experienced these events before or after their critical years. We also see that the results regard-
ing the validity of the living-in-history hypothesis and the keeping-history-alive hypothesis are

mixed. In line with the living-in-history hypothesis, we see that people who experienced the Sec-
ond World War, the independence of Indonesia, the establishment of social security, the fall of the
Berlin Wall and the fall of Srebrenica consider these events significantly more important than do
people who did not consciously experience them. On the other hand, we find that people who
experienced the arrival of Turkish and Moroccan guest workers, the emancipation of women and
the independence of Suriname do not consider these events more important than do people who did
not experience these events. This is in line with the keeping-history-alive hypothesis.
Table 4 displays the results of the open-ended question.Again, no evidence is found for the criti-
cal years hypothesis. People who experienced the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the terrorist attacks
of 9/11 and the introduction of the euro in their critical years do not consider these events signifi-
cantly more important than do people who experienced them before or after their critical years. We
also see that people who experienced the collapse of the Berlin Wall consider this event more
important than do people who did not experience this event. This is in line with the living-in-his-
tory hypothesis but contradicts the general idea of the keeping-history-alive hypothesis.
Other demographic factors and the importance of events. Next, we compare the explanatory power of
age compared to gender and ethnicity. In Hypothesis 2a we formulated the expectation that women
would consider the emancipation of women more important than men would. This hypothesis is
confirmed by the results of the analyses, as reported in Table 5. Women consider the emancipation
of women significantly more important than men do. Additional analyses furthermore showed that
the effect of gender on the importance attached to the emancipation of women is significantly
stronger than the effect of gender on the importance attached to fall of the Berlin Wall, the arrival
of guest workers and the fall of Srebrenica. The results in Table 5 also provide support for Hypoth-
esis 2b that events pointing to specific ethnic minority groups are considered more important by
members of these groups than they are by those of ethnic majority groups. Respondents of both
Turkish and Moroccan background regarded the arrival of Turkish and Moroccan guest workers as
more important than those of Dutch background did. Similarly, respondents of Surinamese back-
ground regarded the independence of Suriname as more important than was the case for those of
native Dutch background. As shown in Table 5, gender and ethnicity are more consistently related
to the importance attached to historical events than age is.
The conditionality of the critical years hypothesis. In the theoretical section, we suggested that critical
years might be important only for certain groups. Table 6 (closed-ended question) and Table 7
(open-ended question) display results testing the conditionality of the effect of formative years on
education and gender.
As indicated in these tables, our main conclusion regarding the validity of the critical years
hypothesis hardly changes when examining the interactions with educational level and gender.
These results also provide no convincing evidence supporting the validity of the critical years
hypothesis.
Robustness checks. Following previous studies on the critical years, we defined the formative years
as being between the ages of 17 and 25, although the exact boundaries have been the subject of
discussion (see, for example, Holmes and Conway, 1999; Schuman et al., 1998; Schuman and Corn-
ing, 2012; Schuman and Rodgers, 2004). Subsequent analyses using different boundaries for the
critical years did not alter our main conclusions (results available from the authors upon request).
In this study, we used data from the LISS-I 2014 panel to test our hypotheses, as immigrants are
oversampled in the data set. This allowed us to conduct a reliable study of the differences between
immigrant groups with regard to the importance attached to historical events. We used data from a

Discussion
In this study, we tested the validity of the critical years hypothesis, which predicts that events
occurring during the critical years (between 17 and 25years old) are particularly likely to be con-
sidered important. In addition to testing the critical years hypothesis, we tested two alternative age
patterns with regard to the importance attached to historical events. More specifically, we tested the
validity of the living-in-history hypothesis and the keeping-history-alive hypothesis. The living-in-
history hypothesis predicts that everyone who consciously experiences an event may consider that
event important and that the critical years are not an exceptional period in this regard. The keeping-
history-alive hypothesis predicts that all age cohorts will consider certain events important, regard-
less of whether they experienced them. Our results provided no substantial supportive evidence for
the critical years hypothesis: respondents who experienced an event during their critical years did

not consider this event significantly more important than did people who were younger or older
when the event occurred. Results regarding the living-in-history hypothesis and keeping-history-
alive hypothesis were mixed.
In addition to testing different age patterns regarding the importance attached to historical
events, we also examined the explanatory power of age compared to other demographic factors.
We predicted that the process of women's emancipation was considered more important by women
than it was by men. This hypothesis was supported by the analyses. We also predicted that several
events would be considered more important by immigrants than they would by natives. This
hypothesis was also supported by the data. In other words, gender and ethnicity were generally
more consistently related to importance attached to historical events than the critical period was.
Finally, we conducted a structural examination of whether the effect of critical period is depend-
ent upon education and gender, in order to gain more insight into the conditionality of the influen-
tial critical years hypothesis. These results also provide hardly any support for the critical years
hypothesis.
In this study, we used both open-ended and closed-ended questions. Interestingly, the two meth-
ods yielded similar conclusions. The Second World War, the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the
terrorist attacks of 9/11 were found to be regarded as the most important historical events using
both methods. In addition, with regard to the validity of the critical years hypothesis, the two meth-
ods resulted in similar conclusions. With regard to gender, our data showed that women considered
almost all historical events more important than men did, and this was especially the case with the
closed-ended questions. One reason could be that women are generally more likely to answer ques-
tions in socially desirable ways (e.g. Chung and Monroe, 2003). Unfortunately, because we had no
reliable measure of social desirability, we were unable to take this aspect into account. In future
studies, it would be interesting to take the aspect of social desirability into account when studying
the importance attached to historical events by means of closed-ended questions.
As outlined in the theoretical section, the Second World War is actively commemorated in the
Netherlands, both in the educational system and by means of annual commemoration days. We
therefore expected people who did not experience this war to consider it equally important as did
those who lived through it (the keeping-history-alive hypothesis). We demonstrated that Dutch
people do indeed consider this war to be by far the most important event in history. Both question
types revealed the Second World War to be the most important event in history. In this regard, we
can conclude that commemoration does indeed matter (see also Corning and Schuman, 2013, on

the influence of commemorations). Yet, in line with the living-in-history hypothesis, we also found
that people who lived through this war consider it more important than people who did not. In other
words, commemorations do seem to have the potential to increase the overall level of importance
attached to historical events, but they do not seem to cause the age patterns predicted by the keep-
ing-history-alive hypothesis.
When it comes to other events, we did find evidence for the keeping-history-alive hypothesis.
More specifically, we found that people who experienced the arrival of Turkish and Moroccan
guest workers, the emancipation of women and the independence of Suriname do not consider
these events more important than do people who did not experience these events. At the time our
data were collected, these events had regained a certain degree of societal relevance. At a rally held
a few weeks before our data were collected, for example, the influential right-wing politician Geert
Wilders asked his supporters whether they wanted more or fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands.
His followers responded by chanting `Fewer, fewer, fewer!'and Wilders concluded `Then we'll see
to that'. His statements were met with outrage and 6400 complaints to the police followed. Wilders
has also argued that immigrants rarely integrate well and do not share the same attitudes towards
liberty and equality as native Dutch people, for example, on the issue of gender equality. A very
heated debate was also taking place about Black Pete, the `servant' of Saint Nicholas, who is por-
trayed using controversial blackface make-up during Saint Nicholas celebrations on 5 December.
People from countries who were exploited for slavery, such as Suriname, are prominent opponents
of blackface. In the light of these societal developments, the arrival of Turkish and Moroccan guest
workers, the emancipation of women and the independence of Suriname had once again become
very relevant and important events for contemporary Dutch society. In other words, it seems that
the age pattern predicted by the keeping-history-alive hypothesis can be explained not by com-
memorations but by the (renewed) relevance of events in current society.
The results for several events were in line with the living-in-history hypothesis: the Second
World War, the independence of Indonesia, the establishment of social security, the fall of the
Berlin Wall and the fall of Srebrenica. It can be argued that most of these events exerted a particu-
larly strong impact on Dutch society at the time they occurred. With the exception of the fall of the
Berlin Wall, all of the events are included in the Dutch canon, which includes the most influential
events in Dutch history (see, for example, Van Oostrom, 2007 for more information on Dutch his-
tory and this canon). The fall of the Berlin Wall is not mentioned in the canon as it was not a Dutch
event.Yet, given the shared economic, social and political histories of Germany and the Netherlands
­ being neighbouring countries ­ the fall of the Berlin Wall also influenced Dutch society substan-
tially (Jürgens, 2014).
In sum, our findings suggest that when events exerted a strong influence on society at the time
they occurred, an age pattern consistent with the living-in-history hypothesis can be observed, and
when events gain renewed societal importance, we see an age pattern consistent with the keeping-
history-alive hypothesis. It seems that the societal importance of an event outweighs the influence
of an individual's age when it occurred. More studies that investigate different events in different
contexts are needed in order to understand the exact reasons for age differences in the importance
attached to historical events. Using additional methods besides survey data might enhance our
understanding of the relation between age and the importance attached to historical events. In-depth
interviews, for example, could tell us more about why different age cohorts consider different
events to be important (see also Corning and Schuman, 2015, who used survey data to investigate
why people feel that historical events are important).
Several of the major theories on generations are based on Mannheim's observations on criti-
cal years, including the influential theory on post-materialism developed by Ronald Inglehart
(1971). He postulated that many societies were undergoing a transformation of individual
de Regt et al. 17
values, switching from materialist values (which emphasize economic and physical security) to
post-materialist values (which emphasize autonomy and self-expression). Generational replace-
ment was argued to be one of the main drivers of this value change. In this study, we tested the
validity of the critical years hypothesis for a wide range of events from different historical
periods, using different methods (open-ended and closed-ended questions) and different sam-
ples. The results yield very little evidence to support the idea that people consider events occur-
ring during their critical years more important or influential than they do events occurring when
they are younger or older. This obviously does not negate the utility of such theories. According
to our analyses, however, societal change resulting from the disappearance of older generations
and the entrance of new generations might be slower than such general theories on generations
might predict. Although differences will remain between age cohorts in terms of attitudes,
beliefs and behaviours resulting from the events they have experienced, such differences are
less likely to be restricted to experiences stemming from their formative years.

Notes
1. In this study, we examine the historical importance of public events rather than their psychological
impact (see, for example, Nourkova and Brown, 2015).
2. Some scholars refer to this hypothesis under other names, including `the impressionable years hypothe-
sis' (see Osborne et al., 2011). The psychological literature contains many studies conducted on autobio-
graphical memories. They use the term reminiscence bump to refer to the finding that a disproportionate
number of autobiographical memories in adults date from adolescence and early adulthood (see, for
example, Koppel, 2013).
3. We use the name `living-in-history' for this hypothesis as it clearly conveys the age pattern as predicted
by this hypothesis: People who consciously experienced an event consider this event more important
than people who did not consciously experience the event. We would like to note, however, that this term
has also been used in studies on how public events are used to organize autobiographical memories (see,
for example, Bohn and Habermas, 2016; Zebian and Brown, 2014).
4. Other names for the idea that importance attached to historical events can extent the critical years include
the `period effect', the `extended cohort experience' and `life-time effects' (e.g. Schuman and Corning,
2006, 2012; Scott and Zac, 1993).
5. http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0018844/geldigheidsdatum_02-10-2013
6. Some of the events that we have studied took place over a longer period of time (e.g. the emancipation
of women). For such events, we conducted the analyses with different periods for the critical years. This
did not alter the conclusions as reported in this article.
7. In this study, we use an equation outlined by Kaufman (1996) to calculate standardized coefficients for
logistic regression.
8. In this study, we analysed only events occurring in specific years/periods. Broad processes occurring
over a long period (e.g. European integration or technological progress) were not included, as it would
not be possible to set clear age boundaries for the critical years with regard to such events.
